0,2021-10-05," two day causes breakdown baked. life. US, given hospital bed. 

They ""have immune system"". good enough. I'd think eligible Good News flair meant explosion cases.  yup. year. like decade gotten tetanus booster? Perhaps short-lived immunity nose throat low virus loads could account that. That‚Äôs interpretation? interpretation unvaccinated people research research sucks.  articles read said ""became ill died."" know illness COVID related? think go. wear mask doors. Pfizer + Moderna I'm *very* curious mix means immunity.

Good ol' Canada. :P Maybe could clear agenda behind post. exactly trying say? Seeking Advice. live east coast US. want go funeral PNW. drove south could visit many people love including many family friends. several years first due finances covid. vaccinated too. main worries are

1. flying funeral, picking variant making someone visit sick.

2. Visiting someone day two later tests positive, ot me, quarantine neither visit people fly back home. 

I could a. Go visit everyone b. go funeral see grandkids daughter c. Save trip later. 

Thoughts? You‚Äôre idiot.  worry it. Many Huntsville natives work defense, space industry, engineering.  study found that, regardless store‚Äôs location (urban versus suburban), sampling day time, location surface within store surface material, samples tested negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA, meaning values detection limit method, also validated control tests.

These results suggest risk exposure high-touch surfaces within grocery store low.    unfortunate   idea, mine said positive negative IgG IgM, give numbers.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wow, almost wrote mini study here. thanks much. great info. can't imagine tight chest feels like hope never get covid. thanks detailed info. much appreciated. Yer Prison Guard, Harry. Schlong covid    I‚Äôve lost one best friends this. anti-establishment repeats rhetoric justify position, victim blames die covid unhealthy. things superior everyone else reads believes ‚Äúmainstream news‚Äù refuses acknowledge global nature pandemic, convinced US government corporations pulling conspiracy us. Literally 100% friends vaccinated one us side effects. cares fear side effects strange number like 9,000 people who‚Äôve adverse reactions, refuses acknowledge millions covid deaths worldwide. 

I don‚Äôt know happened friend, makes hard hang fixated ideas can‚Äôt normal convos anymore. thing parents actually. I‚Äôve lost loved ones conspiracies covid. Well based data, NZ first dose rate higher USA, despite USA massive outbreak, vaccine producer depend imports  point. Last big pandemic U.S. far!  Huntsville pretty unique, different rest bama. lot transplants many defense contractors located here. one hand get lots engineers love beer (so shitload craft breweries city life comes along that), thanks DoD money (which largely means lean conservative).

As much wanted move away right high school, grown pretty awesome tons do, beautiful nature around. It‚Äôs perfect Huntsville really good trajectory. must one pfizer gang. yep -i check phone way inserted article!

frankly though, nice read international article question - lcoal press desperately adds take bias arcticle Oz  didn‚Äôt discover research.    somehow suspect cases surrounding coworkers rejoiced. doubt first incidence healthcare workers.  bad faith best arguably deliberately fraudulent.  Including father April.
Wish people around took seriously Roll tide! use DMA (designated market area) list get idea population major urban centers.  Another case working planned US. trying start fight anything, something well-functioning government could would nationalizing segment mask production industry cranking millions n95 masks equivalent.

Not far-fetched, done countries. particular, buy mask like quarter South Korea. would urge go YouTube click recently recorded Seoul Walking Tour video (city walking tours actual genre YouTube). see almost every single person wearing n95 mask. matter month recorded in, made last year going see thousands people wearing high-grade masks.

That's ROK
 government got involved early said, ""If cloth masks good, n95 masks must better!"" got done. started giving things away like crazy making available literally every store country. one wears crappy cloth mask avoid 

In case wondering quality masks, New York Times recently called Korean n95 masks gold standard masks. 

Now, obviously Trump never going take proactive steps, give Biden benefit doubt really deserve, probably banking idea vaccination going solve everyone's problems. Korea option.

Nonetheless, amazing limited Americans' imaginations comes practical things government help public designed serve. lot people they‚Äôre told don‚Äôt really introspect actions. It‚Äôs really scary me.  think??? Maple Syrup Quebec, straight veins. But, tbh, Canadians get booster every year. Idiocracy created.   Hi hoping someone help interpret covid antibody test. result 1580 u/ml. trying decide get booster‚Ä¶ thoughts based results? It‚Äôs impossible find range online. Thank you!!  familiar AstraZeneca + Moderna, Canada booster work? like attack beaver Molson commercials years back? I‚Äôm getting issue eczema it‚Äôs cold :( cloth masks make miserable trigger vertigo    Maybe. fine sectors. one rely keep us dying. 18, 2020, (EUA), think full approval yet?

If decent national healthcare system USA, could tests different variations dosage, timing etc ... think UK much better this? Herman Cain awards

Did know one till now. Thank much! don‚Äôt enjoy sucking wet cardboard halfway iced latte? must hate turtles   Sounds like making issue nothing TBH, like complaining toddler. help AI already developed new methods fighting previously resistant strains, I'm positive continue so. bottleneck cooperation physical production distribution. really suck fair, $35M drop bucket terms national budget cost drug development. Anyone driven Alabama? spend money need most: roads! Even though cities, INTERSTATES 6 (3x3) lanes! truly luxurious drive straight without stopping.  Underlying problem complete lack credible data coming Florida. study model trash underlying data correct.

Under DeSantis exactly have, bad data design. fewer vaccinated? fewer practicing social distancing? fewer masking properly?  


I'm betting that's why. 520 now. Secretly, folks scared needles. Introduce covid prophylaxis pill watch line up.  could somewhat mitigated, far scary is, robust testing public private sectors runs AI litmus tests intentionally vague, intentionally deceptive scenarios / verbage / images thrown every company's every proposed govt AI results scores publicly published. idea well many fronts, could compared other, constantly, updates. Private companies like secrets tested might say? Well already test company secrets drugs, food, finances still maintain proprietary secrecy protect profits.  worry superior genes protected big daddy clouds? can't believe people would give jobs risk livelihoods minor vaccination, 

You mean didn‚Äôt foresee people dying vaccinated mid pandemic wouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated save job? 

But real, hills die choose (gestures toward FEMA trailer)  agree assessment, could quit USSR    arm soreness sure hurt enough makes brain hurt close two years months vaccine available *still* something needs addressed.  That's right. Start phone. Studies shown phones average 10x bacteria toilet seats.

And TBH even though COVID spread fomites extremely unlikely, sanitizing surfaces washing hands reduces odds getting illnesses tend spread surfaces norovirus. Astra-derna rep well.

My wife got Pfizer + Moderna wonder works...

I still remember lot vaccine shoppers refusing take Moderna wanted pfizer.   Brother law believes people dying vaccine within first 2 weeks getting shot. officially ""fully vaccinated"" 2 weeks second shot (in Canada correct.) everyone dying vaccine within first two weeks reported non-vaccinated deaths.

He's constantly moving goalpost unreachable. 100% believes Bill Gates behind ""did know dad involved in..."" ""there covid meeting months lockdown. planned"".

And paramedics get ""danger pay"" visiting covid patient need check box form, paramedics lying get extra pay reporting covid cases.

The stuff comes time getting real unbearable. He's smart guy too. there's absolutely nothing say change mind believe anything long lines anti-covid vaccine beliefs. would upvote, 69 right now. Facebook real evil. follow HCA sub, you‚Äôll see shitpost almost exclusively come Facebook. many survive kidneys start going? Like percentage wise? It‚Äôs understanding many would like hear people seeing happen real time (or data )  Source?   joined rest airlines didn‚Äôt hear.  Article says suspended 2,200 employees nation wide getting shot. Google says 304,220 employees, guess need update 302,020 employees. don‚Äôt believe medicine enough get vaccine, come hospital? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è less funding public schools too, solve issue   premature toddler developed lungs. slightly ocd/germophobic came along feel 100% justified current situation BiVaccinated üò≤ Compared others sounds like well.

Saw someone day vaccinated saying really felt bad.

Vaccines work. Introverted heck, I'm ready precovid life back üë∂üß†  We're allowed mix south. weird. none either shot.    Someone needs make vax jesus anti vaxers. Touches water moderna bread masks thought Albania moment. Fox News right-leaning it‚Äôs niche found themselves, since media companies liberal.

It makes good business sense, produce entertainment, real news. People believe Tucker Carlson Sean Hannity tell probably demographic thinks ‚Äúpro‚Äù wrestling real sport. two biggest factors covid deaths dense population is, dense population is. Sounds like bad case OCD Alabamans? Alabamians, right? gf combo. experienced slight shivers J&amp;J went away night. Moderna feeling tired, shivers intense. night sweat lot long night sleep felt 90% normal again. bit tired still shoulder hurt. everything seen threading citizens hell would even want go there?

I feel like Covid become mental health issue many.  sequenced 6 times though two months. certain number people infected virus, likely outcome going stochastic extinction. Even virus infects 1.5 people average, lot average comes parties events schools such, virus population 1 likely going die unless happens one party events 

Delta actually first sequenced US July 2020. Definitely sometimes take first time they're observed, due luck I‚Äôm sure guys would hire work truck, since research. Lol Time plan road trips alonggggg while.  fair comment worth pointing NZ's hand forced Delta accidentally arriving proving impossible eliminate via lockdown. plan open point - still quite finished providing vaccines everybody wants one (we're probably 2-3 weeks last people getting second doses, resistant/stragglers). case numbers low moment we've strict lockdown seven weeks. We'll certainly large wave (our first) next months, restrictions gradually ease. Maybe instead feeding information, need try appeal emotional side it. Since obvious information going through. live short distance main CU medical campus...aka shitload neighborhood nurses, docs, staff, etc...

1. vax rate hood something like 98%.

2. Nobody mentioned change pace work terminated staff. Seems business usual (well, usual 2020/21)  guess better get use bus tickets man. never happen. thought hospitals making billions recording every death caused COVID could get another federal check??  üòÇüòÇmight well light fire point I‚Äôve seeing less less page. forgot COVID can‚Äôt believe people still dying it. point outcast unvaccinated put state. university banned unvaccinated coming back it‚Äôs ghost town.

Ok thank you. lots inaccuracies -

* Measles high R0, highest possible, highest know of.  Hopefully virus never comes close contagious.

* ability transmit could make worse, lethality, even less lethal version serious long term effects like vascular injuries.

* evolution effects random. entirely possible single mutation change Sars-CoV-2 could make much contagious lethal... fact happened make Delta variant exist.  Random mutations care what's gone likely change is.

* Measles evolved rinderpest, cattle disease, 1500 years ago. ""millions years adaptation"" anyway, did, Sars-CoV-2 could still pass R0 number single mutation.  That's less likely new mutation making non infectious humans making damaging...it's random. don‚Äôt understand downvoted asking question. makes sense me. 

However, I‚Äôm also questioning numbers, Governor Memaw made every death evaluated confirmed COVID death. would bet average death rate quite larger classified state COVID death. Also, deaths take average 25 days reported, go review. mean three months left, plus last month yet added. would also think rural areas suffered disproportionate rate urban ones. densely populated areas hit hard, wasn‚Äôt vaccine would made last years number large was. think rural areas definition make harder spread, happened Delta wave. Rural hospitals see deaths month seeing daily. haven‚Äôt looked see evidence support theory, think would live county level data equalized per capita displayed time. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

It‚Äôs is, statistically insignificant. even get breakthrough, odds ending hospital dying low seasonal flu. vaccine essentially turns Covid cold-like illness.

I'm sure accuracy FL's vaccination numbers.

Miami big hub vaccine tourists Central South America. people's shots getting counted occurring, think taken FL's denominator.

I've never seen analysis many people might be, pre-covid Miami saw 23m tourists year (counting domestic international). things might happen faster people state move in. places like houston, austin, atlanta, miami growing kaiser temporary.

Crippling arm pain dose one, strong flu-like symptoms dose two almost arm pain. I'm really wondering booster dose would look like Moderna recipients. I'm really sorry. can't imagine much harder getting would confide partner creation second class citizen group based medical choice fascinating philosophical question think people taking seriously moment. moment, people, situation seems cut dry: ""Get vaccine helps &amp; others else suffer consequences."" many good public health reasons encourage vaccination - via carrots sticks.

However, moving premise 20- 30- 50 years technology advances, would feel comfortable principles applying medical interventions? 

If discovered way (galactica-style) make genetic tweaks ensured person would much reduced chance disease transfer future -- would okay mandate (or deny services person receive genetic tweak)?  

Maybe so. Maybe society/ technology changes, entirely fine mandate things. interesting philosophical question think giving full consideration yet.  want compare going nowadays source agrees you. 100 mcg gives modestly better response compared 25 mcg. global perspective, moving 25 mcg would quadruple reach; paper would seem support strategy expecting immunity stay stable long haul. 

""We compared immune responses 25-Œºg 100-Œºg doses mRNA-1273 (Fig. 4, K). Anti-spike IgG, anti-RBD IgG, PSV-neutralizing titers approximately twofold higher 100-Œºg vaccinees compared received 25-Œºg dose (Fig. 4I), consistent earlier reports (9, 28, 40).

US federal government confiscates kinds PPE shipments already paid for, auction states pay most, shipped shady new companies. Good. common mode transmission, happen, say ""vanishingly unlikely."" think argument prisons set effective COVID response (distancing sanitization), technically building new prisons appropriate way prevent spread (in prisoners guards) sounds weird

No. doesn't. Lol even got downvoted. 

After Trump presidency everything become divisive, questioning means drawn line sand.

I appreciate response though, makes sense me.  hospitals overwhelmed like alaska Oh man. thread full people read headline filled stuff that's headline. study reported says 25 microgram dose Moderna enough, implying 33 microgram dose used Pfizer enough, 100 microgram dose used currently Moderna likely unncessarily high. Neither blood cells platelets nucleuses, protein assembly capacity either, viruses can't replicate them; so, generally can't get worse. problem would blood chemistry get, immune response get levelled body average recirculation.

I suspect respiratory disease bloodborne disease, volumes required infection, particularly showing symptoms; anyone virus probably antibodies go it, infection would reduced.

I reckon would last longer outside exposure, simply stays wet cold. tried find decent numbers, studies vivo end virion infecting new cell, there's much long virus survive free floating. HIV survives blood products, reckon long enough. thing happening romania. days we're breaking records weekends, we're testing much.

most cases EVER: december 2020 - 10k cases per day. 

last week: 11-12k cases, yesterday 15k cases article actually good people got Pfizer. study Moderna tried ""low-dose"", happens close actual Pfizer dose, found works. real harm individuals got Moderna higher dose, except maybe little stronger side effects, study indicates Pfizer-dosage level would worked well. Hesitancy caused believing anything government says/does. Availability far problem; matter fact, Russia country world, get vaccine tourist. someone donates organ fails mental health main priority. 

Same someone receives organ fails. Suicide very, real worry. 

If someone receiving mental health treatment safety net/system. likelihood suicide mental health conditions drops significantly. None new. Vaccines required nearly century various activities employment.

Your stance/argument also new all. find similar stuff seatbelt laws went affect. article study gave Moderna ""low-dose"", happens close actual dose Pfizer. study involve Pfizer way that's headline Moderna, result Moderna works well Pfizer-doses, implications study Pfizer positive: higher dosage Moderna uses necessary. seems like part trend ‚Äúmental health minimization‚Äù comes COVID-19.

Unfortunately, getting ‚Äúmild Covid‚Äú anything mild, especially long run. study came today showing people long Covid, could half people ger even asymptomatic COVID, micro clots capillaries. could seeing serious health problems many years come ‚Äúmild cases‚Äú.

So unless gets resolved kind treatment another, no, can‚Äôt stop worrying live COVID. September 7th. travel Canada without quarantine got 2 shots.

EDIT: Also, never stay hotel 10/14 days. 3 rest time could stay hotel/airbnb. Working healthcare believing vaccines they'll stay home... people can't get vacation's?

If can't afford vacations, stay home.

On serious note: can't vaccinated (for whatever reasons), able transplant recievers (because resons). media companies liberal.

Eitherway, fat lady hasnt sung yet. posted r/upliftingnews me, important standard success would reduction transmission illness. study tell us enough establish that.

The thing study seems tell us high touch, frequently cleaned surfaces show presence COVID. judge whether fanatical surface-cleaning represents success reducing *transmission* *of illness*, would also need know:

1. would level fomites use normal cleaning procedures (i.e. level cleaning would typical pre-pandemic)?
2. Would level fomites posed significant risk infection touched?

There‚Äôs actually significant doubt touching surface level COVID present actually poses meaningful risk infection: Wyllie says, extraordinary chain events would need happen successfully spread SARS-CoV-2 surface. sufficiently large amount virus would need sprayed infected person onto surface. surface would need right kind material, exposed right levels light, temperature, humidity virus quickly degrade. virus would need picked up‚Äîwhich would likely hands. virus vulnerable there. (‚ÄúEnveloped‚Äù viruses like SARS-CoV-2 fare well porous surfaces like skin clothing.) needs find way inside you‚Äîusually nose eye‚Äîin concentration big enough get past mucosal defenses establish cells. risk, Wyllie concludes, low. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve washed groceries disinfected bags even thought twice mail,‚Äù says.

So yes, seems likely people deride ""hygiene theatre"" probably lead low likelihood Covid present surface. Whether that's actually big decrease compared normal cleaning, whether would matter anyways, yet established.

I think term ""hygiene theatre"" expression skepticism value fanatical surface cleaning. People using term often thinking something like: kinds less conspicuous things business could would ***very*** effective reducing risk transmission -- notably improving *ventilation systems*, given huge role aerosols play transmission. tend bother practices since they're highly conspicuous customers way surface cleaning is, instead focus lot energy something probably produces minor benefit best. They're better job *looking* safe rather actually *being* safe. borders sacrosanct! /s guess could say lay offs 99% survival rate‚Ä¶ yet still can‚Äôt get fucking job.

Important note natural infection increased substantially 4 months, provides varied protection weighted vaccinated. absolutely love see risk/reward calculation done Moderna? achieve ? Especially view delta Vaccines appear provide significant protection Long Covid well.

* published Lancet found odds symptoms 28 days post-vaccination infection approximately halved two vaccine doses
* Vaccines also seem reduce prevalence symptoms according another found receive vaccine small overall improvement Long Covid symptoms, decrease worsening symptoms (5.6% vaccinated vs 14.2% unvaccinated) increase symptom resolution (23.2% vaccinated vs 15.4% unvaccinated)

So, apart reduction chance getting infected, vaccines also added benefit reducing Long Covid main reason immune response infection highly variable. individuals robust response others won't. Since vaccine standardized, there's higher probability producing effective response vaccine. 

Also, vaccination infection shown produce strong immunity, superior either method alone. everyone still benefits vaccination.

Finally, requiring covid vaccination (remember many others already required) way ensure standards transplant easily followed rather complicated set conditions.

I'd definitely agree that, there's still level intent exists comparison say necessary overlays original scenario. arsonist's intent start keep fire going - non-vaxx-ed person say intent (at least I'd hope not).  gotten car crash need lung transplant gotten vaccine, less chance surviving process. simple triage. Since organ high demand/low supply item, go someone likely survive. that's something worried might happen, maybe get vaccinated. uup iuu Thanks  Okay already reiterated. sure everyone jumping this. 1. mask game. Get well-fitting N95 KN95.
2. Increase ventilation possible.
3. unmask, try around others.

For second question, we'll learn well vaccinations work, continue develop new treatments, helpful increasingly available. Thank quick reply sir! 

Yes, need learn indeed. said I‚Äôll sign medical waiver. sign waiver anyway transplant itself, releasing anything could possibly go wrong,‚Äù said Lutali. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs surgery, it‚Äôs invasive. sign waiver life. I‚Äôm sure can‚Äôt sign waiver COVID shot.‚Äù

Imagine thinking people hospital. went moderna cause easier area. wanted get vaccinate quickly could could get back life. Little know anti-vaxxers would fuck idea.

I hope sort travel mixed doses soon, intend travel internationally anytime soon. Gotcha, appreciate reply.  probably definitely needed groups, know within weeks months. comfort, look like Moderna retains efficacy than, longer than, Pfizer.

Boosters may benefit people they're recommended, reason many hospitalizations deaths still 70 million people US started vaccination series. even vaccines, masks, ventilation, care Covid important roles.

However, vaccinated COVID-19 vaccine would considered vaccine hesitant group.

My question is, concerned scientific community knowing root causes side effects mRNA vaccines like drastic changes cycles women, knowing root cause even actual rates myocarditis young males?


Sweden Denmark paused distribution Moderna vaccine young males internal data shows soke kind relationship myocarditis pericarditis, I've seen dozens studies estimate rates diseases 1 3000 1 100,000 similar populations.

I also understand increased risk conditions that's quite high actual covid infection. second question have, would vaccines side effects rates approved normal circumstances Covid factor valid argument ""its worth taking vaccine Covid serious impact vaccine"" could used?  oklahoma city blows mind healthcare workers willing die hill.

""Medical personnel"" used describe anyone working medical facility range high level doctors/registered nurses janitors working night shift.

While outliers among doctors registered nurses vaccinated, rates vaccination high - doctors think 98% registered nurses rates well 90%.

The correlation exists New York City school system 98% principals fully vaccinated 96% teachers. figure weeks ago compliance might higher. However, lower compliance rates among janitors lower level administrative workers example.  Great question! know sure appears vaccine-induced immunity consistent. people seem quite immune, least awhile, infection, others seem mount much immune response, people wanes quickly. even infected, get vaccinated. children aren‚Äôt yet eligible vaccine.  immunocomprised cancer patient still fully vaccinated (had second shot two weeks), super scary public anywhere.

Definitely something could gone whole pandemic without seeing, guess nurse ideas.  


What fucking scumbag. I'm sure think Florida telling truth numbers. extensive history lying COVID, think they'd stop now?  reason cases seem rise fall without changes restrictions? That's Same. Got Covid week first dose Moderna. Got second dose 14 days infected. guy def lives huntsville Necessary sense preventing everyone moving forward It‚Äôs going mega blockbuster drug reason Seattle resident, absolutely agree exists. lived places, promise that, average resident areas, intensity same. Yeah, PNW/Left Coast die-hards, broadly super-passionate regional pride doesn‚Äôt exist way.  never are. Quote link, ""The team also found vaccine generated similar immune memory SARS-CoV-2 spike protein natural infection."" literally said shots lol. antivax anti-vaxers turned religion. simply matter faith them. Proof logic nothing it. Grown men? Sounds like big babies me.  Ok fine, critical portion sequences identical. Whos going run prison? private company... good, I'm getting booster   Agreed. Someone careless disregard humanity general, wouldn‚Äôt work me. We‚Äôre talking immune compromised here, someone can‚Äôt research believes read Facebook. Absolutely never. long wait see side effects? Unfortunately immune systems give lifetime protection diseases. Covid, protection seems start decreasing pretty sharply 4 6 months. Importantly, one things new study shows protection hospitalization much durable, staying 90%. vaccine still really protecting us lot, still need learn works long term often many boosters need.

Personally, younger, plan wait studies follow government's recommendation boosters age group, yet approved.  'Mysterious', eh? 

JFC, obtuse clueless one find 'mysterious'? Good Texas would oil high tech, NASA military jobs would disappear real quick, would ton medical research funded NIH CDC.

What call 119 healthcare workers fired anti-vaccine?

A good start! quite right, actually.

Even previous infection gave ZERO protection reinfection, reinfection numbers would dramatically lower infection Carolina 1.4 million cases covid, 10,812 reinfections.

The population NC 10.5 million. So, entire pandemic, 1.4 million confirmed infections 10.5 million people since March 2020.

For reinfections, already infected. that's bit 11k infections 1.4M people. actually lower 1.4 million people passage time (see below). even without taking time consideration, 13% people infected since start pandemic, reinfections (if rate) would 13% 13%, again, that's considering passage time factors means even zero immunity reinfections, would expect number even lower still.

1. Possible reinfections shorter time frame initial infections. Reinfections obviously go way back March 2020, infected reinfection 90 days later. time difference exacerbated things:

a) portion 1.4M people recently even technically enough time reinfection count numbers (you 90+ days positive tests). Anyone got infected recent wave counts 1.4M number, can't even theory count 11k number.

b) Immunity wears time.

* earliest infections less testing. impacts numbers, likely disproportionately reinfections compared infections time factor;
* LOT people infected fairly recently, like last two waves. people infected late would less chance reinfection due less time immunity wear off.
* people infected infected large waves. least 1 fewer wave could reinfected compared infected, likely wave.
* Reinfections would likely later pandemic earlier. ratio reinfections infections would lower early on, later vaccines prevent ratio going up.

1. lot cases asymptomatic light people get tested. one two times person infected falls that, count reinfected could STILL count infected reinfections actually make infection/reinfection ratio look like fewer relative reinfections (if get tested one times).  MMR fades. tested pre-conception appointment sufficient titers Measles Rubella longer. get shot stop trying get pregnant months.

You‚Äôre better judging based time since last vaccination personal risk tolerance getting mild case.  Protection hospitalisation stays high, even circulating antibodies dropped - body make time prevent severe illness. (But live someone high risk immunocompromised may want higher protection infection you‚Äôre much less likely spread it.) Simple solution, stop treating unvaccinated. asked nurse second shot told move stretch arm lot. helped quite bit. even sleep side 1st shot. south ever anything seething pit ignorance?

Seems strongly point vaccine ineffectiveness -- specifically new infections need wait problem fix itself. It‚Äôs Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs hospital. don‚Äôt peel back bandage. Preferably close relative. personally three doses Moderna. also know EMS worker three doses still got Covid. barely got sick. Didn‚Äôt even know Covid weekly test came positive. Moderna works. plethora studies /r/covid19 showing single vaccine dose infection (and always months after) raises measurable immune response (antibodies look t/b cell counts) much higher either alone.

But COVID data. COVID data related open information laws arrests/crime. confusing completely different things. Thanks, makes sense. Seems like needs situation right propagation. Here's hoping variants run luck, Delta last worrisome variant encounter. Qantas hadn‚Äôt even flying internationally it‚Äôs like even running reliable.   number waves, might triggered things like weather holidays. Delta obvious one wave.

The best answer people's behavior changes response less threat. Restrictions help influence that, thing influences behavior.

Note used static measure people's behavior middle August. really address changes behavior. Maybe see everything read online true?  US, Darwin say's otherwise. Unless course war declared.

Whats alarm mean?

War declared. No, could lower, higher, same. assays standardized two results compared unless manufacturer. Furthermore isn‚Äòt known level would provide degree protection disease. Bottom line, don‚Äôt decide get booster based something know nothing about. Get you‚Äôre eligible 6 months 2nd dose. Tees pees.....roll tide! one states produces food

I ready come back ""all states produce food"" yeah course mean Iowa there. curiosity lead look up, right behind CA number 2 (based $$ Ag).  Replace works fiction‚Ä¶oh, wait. Exactly, add that, Pfizer data only. Moderna, J&amp;J vaccines available globally, making decisions based Israeli data prudent US, country. Israel good citizens, people need stop using Israeli data defacto proof boosters required. 

That said, real question needs answered vaccines require boosters, long based initial dose regimen, yields longer lasting efficacy, sort data slowly coming analysis done. boosters required, eventually? Maybe, large dose get optimized result still needs determined depending vaccine took. Delta variant far infectious original virus. far easier spread catch it. people getting exposed last year. 58% population unvaccinated still lot people burn through. True - also keep mind prior January 2021 standard pcr cycle set higher. caught lot ‚Äúasymptomatic cases‚Äù may actually covid, fleeting didn‚Äôt produce meaningful antibodies  already figure transmission surface contact vanishingly unlikely? Fwiw talking authorizing vaccines 12s; alive 100 years getting shot, statistically speaking. I'm convinced. Alabama still flyover state book. Never set foot god forsaken state. Suuuuuurrrrrrreeeeeeee horrible outcome. upvoted felt bad news get vote. northern states think going up? experienced delta already headed back down. Yeah..only people go church anti vax üôÑ moron Brilliant. Came comments, disappoint. Air conditioning! Curious know alternative you? even read article? pick based headline? 

‚ÄúThe distinction important many people realize vaccines primarily prevent disease necessarily infection. means vaccines block fully vaccinated people transmitting pathogen others.‚Äù

It goes explain vaccines lower viral load vaccinated individuals slows spread, doesn‚Äôt completely eliminate transmission. Good chunk state 4 lanes start getting close cities. goes 6 people live suburbs commute anywhere 15min-1hr drive depending live. LA/ATL levels gridlock, highlights 6 Lanes 4. think so, ALDOT basically refuses anything put gun head. reason Birmingham got roads redone I20/59 bridges interchange rebuilt World Games next year. apparently needing done 20 years now... 

But yeah, state tendency embezzlement frivolous projects rather repairing maintaining infrastructure.


Edit: also annual migration one state's lakes/Gulf Shores/Panama City Beach (yes know Florida, cheap enough close enough common destination) backs traffic.  Good, elderly mother Kaiser. must protected costs. understanding vaccine works? Traditional vaccines means body creates antibodies.

I AZ. side effects similar infection lasting 36 hours

My son Pfizer side effects similar infection lasting 36 hours.

My two daughters Moderna. One daughter side effects all. swelling lymph nodes side body injected. swelling became noticeable nodes size small marble. happened week. another 7 days still there. get second dose 2 weeks.

Moderna Pfizer made method understand instructions given make antibodies, rather body reacting creating own. wrong please correct me.

Is problem Pfizer due fact 30iu dose Moderna 100iu?

Is correlation getting side effects protection? Again, nothing really new. need host vaccines go colleges. need college degree good jobs. So, vaccine mandate jobs old hat. Holidays coming right antibodies waning many, think boosters great idea. everyone starts hopping onto planes gathering together. Especially stretched thin hospital staff right now. dont think know meaning word. day COVID variants spread unvaccinated communities. Ya, long process. get clearances pretty much year unless living donor. There's many strict measures Alberta get one. Total toll currently stands 2,051 cases (558 local) 7 fatalities state. I'm dialysis Alberta last week went around checking people vaccinated. prioritized 3rd shots. also told unvaccinated people they're taken transplant list.

Fuck people. hope kidney go waste called next person list.  lead horse water, eat apple paste. Sometimes trash takes    Sort-of. research behind RNA vaccines took 20 years hardly anyone talking about. originally developed combat SARS, two decades ago. SARS end threatening planet, work put mostly hold, groups still fiddling concept.

I've scheduled mine later month (the day 6 month eligibility clears) Transplant patients already required numerous vaccines titers checked even accepted transplant programs placed waiting lists, addition many requirements. policy line transplant lists worked decades now. Larger risk patients denied transplants, medical lifestyle reasons. Covid significantly higher mortality rate organ recipients, particularly kidneys.

The problem organ demand far outweighs supply, decide gets one. Top quite work conditions give way time make decisions others.

They always decided transplants likely live longer life result. child, example, get bumped ahead elderly person. Certain lifestyle choices disqualify person transplant list. giving liver big drinker, example. chronic issues exclude people lists, well, pose risk complications shorten person's life significantly. Covid major damage transplant recipients, particularly kidney transplants. gets considered now, 20-30% mortality rate among unvaccinated kidney recipients.  myself. Remember good vaccine protection, we‚Äôd still cautious. someone day two later tests positive, ot me, quarantine neither visit people fly back home.

So, reproduce proficiently 37C lab ""survives"" worse 37C?

2) much higher confirmed covid rate - areas know ~18% covid, much protection alpha delta, seems like reinfection ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù pretty high


(6) found we‚Äôre mixing boosters. Az dropped, third doses Pfizer Moderna vice versa


(7) ‚ÄúFreedom Day!‚Äù means masks England. all. schools, public transport, supermarkets, bars, restaurants. Government decided let business decide, masks effectively dropped. IMO likely cases dropping Scotland retained.

Failing vaccinate kids meant covid burning schools, passing throughout community. Coupled nobody wearing masks, UK seeing covid cases next 5/6 European countries combined (mostly Eastern Europe people choosing get vaccinated). \*laughs darkly\*

But true since dawn transplants.

Alcoholics can't get liver transplants. Smokers can't get lung transplants.

Transplant organs scarce. need go people mostly likely get good result.  Lmfao  awful argument.

Treatment broken leg scarce.

Organs scarce. People die every day waiting one.

We give liver transplants alcoholics, lung transplants smokers scarce resources need allocated good. That's makes hypocrite.

I think sums whole thing really nicely - bad English can't preach medical care all

Who said that? one. fact, everyone agrees alcoholics get liver transplants, smokers get lung transplants.

I really see coming from. antivaxxer, believe almost world's doctors malicious conspiracy deliver poisonous vaccinations us.

So would want treatment first place? call COVID-19 infectious diseases, whose avoidance simple safe easy discovered way (gattaca-style) make genetic tweaks ensured person would much reduced chance disease transfer future -- would okay mandate (or deny services person receive genetic tweak)?

Yes. principle applies. easy call make, weigh greater good assuming safety lack side-affects.

However, slippery slope. E.g., would principle justify euthanasia, incarceration exclusion people likely propogate disease, whether genetically infected? Think lepers.

My grade-school-level understanding mRNA vaccines contain mRNA ""plans"" cause body produce spike proteins coronaviruses use invade cells.

Your immune system develops response that's effective spike proteins, thus coronaviruses use them, without ever encountering real coronavirus.

That immune response reason vaccine make feel sick. Naturally, immune response stronger second dose two-dose vaccines, many people report second dose feels much worse. (It sure me.)

And fact vaccine contains actual virus reason that, unlike older vaccines based ""inactivated"" viruses, completely impossible acquire coronavirus infection mRNA vaccine.

I would certainly get third dose 6-8 months, especially high-exposure-risk profession come contact older people (even they're vaccinated). data dose 4-6 months; likely good there's chance could significantly worse.

Yeah, position ""vaccine good""(or precisely, ""we actual news source need write things mostly true""), inflammatory, divisive, obviously-made-for-clicks headlines articles nothing piss people make everyone trust doctors gov less. way Covid-19 covered cancerous obviously made generate outrage money.

MSM give fuck vaccination health people, else would cover topics neutral factual tone. argument fetal cell lines used early development vaccines. Therefore, ‚Äúprofiting‚Äù abortion. two major flaws argument.

The HEK cell line commonly used (used Pfizer Moderna) unknown whether cells elective abortion. Abortion illegal country created, good chance miscarriage.

The second large number drugs vaccines, old new tested way. You‚Äôd need reject consistent. There‚Äôs probably way successful kidney transplant use drugs tested cell line.

However, Facebook full lies tells people vaccines created aborted babies. mean... can't fault decision. limited supply want go people make responsible choices around all. Someone take vaccine, catches disease prevents, goes hospital gets put ECMO subsequently needs kidney afterwards. 

You look person think ""Are suddenly going make good decisions make successful transplant?"" likely happen. better decision give transplants recipients situation due poor decision-making.

Finite pool resources, unvaxxed therefore waste resources.   man average IQ thinks Einstein.

No, not.  vaccinating 18s weeks (my husband driving Instructor several students vaccinated). They've recently started younger teens. slow happened term started.

I think we're testing LOT well.

The main problem hardly consideration given Covid anymore. often one wearing mask shops. People given go ahead care anymore don't. hope kids get bad complications üò• Prudent choice overall improve universal survivability, live US privatized healthcare system I‚Äôll point out: it‚Äôs also fiscally responsible choice healthcare provider. privatized system, dead customer can‚Äôt pay (except what‚Äôs collectible estate), it‚Äôs hospital‚Äôs best interest offer something like organ transplant someone likely survive pay off. Putting healthcare hands business means inherently judged profitability company.

If don‚Äôt like it, write leaders demand changed. immunosuppressants reduce immune systems actively whole. ppl get vaccines smaller immune response make much antibody. get sick dont make enough antibodies fight infection.

These rules organ transplant, article about, standard. rules ppl need adhere get organ transplants strict bc availability organs small. skill needed transplant huge surgeons. regiment keep organ alive life long cannot one moment stopped. dad got lung transplant right. number things eligible insane. lose weight. get tooth fixed get tooth extracted later would risk infection. undergo million shots, blood draws, vaccines, etc.  wondering delay 2nd 3rd shots help building stronger lasting immunity? beginning vaccinations debating length shots better immune response. that's still applicable hopefully booster last longer. I‚Äôm medical background little clue I‚Äôm ask stupid - violation Hippocratic oath? Please don‚Äôt downvote me, I‚Äôm legitimately curious ""I'd agree you, we'd wrong"" Kaiser, absolutely love it. one last visits youngest son couple months ago, able convince nurse get vaccinated. casually asked well thought questions (bc education background occupation) later came back room give us paperwork told helped feel confident excited get vaccinated (and husband too).  Going Israel's results, two weeks post 3rd vaccine practically bullet proof least. Thank you. Exactly right. personal choices put position EXTREMELY precious donated organ die go waste, denied. organ could literally save someone else's life instead killing it.

Anti-vaxx also easy litmus test understanding science, medicine, willingness actually listen doctors follow advice. put much faith horseshit misinformation even take vaccine, medical professionals rightly assume affect ability good organ donor CANDIDATE.

Which brings next point...I bolded word reason. organ donation CANDIDATE. word implies certain things, like pass vetting process. worst part people reddit insisting really sick. hate site much. know easy way get kidney three weeks.  pretty much felt covid (pre-vaccine availability), two weeks. laid floor trying play daughter nodding off. comirnaty sounds like name got dropped sherlock holmes favor something sinister sounding. B roll name. can't get liver transplants. Smokers can't get lung transplants.

Technically true. truth go triage systems. Alcoholics go far back line.

Effectively yes correct can't get cruelty, put back list. abundance organs still get transplant.  mean, scarce? I've got dozens them! wanted mutant powers, got stupid immunity deadly communicable disease! Smh one knows, time observe people 6 months 3rd shot see immunity sustains. That's people mean preexisting condition.

We deny care preexisting conditions Canada either. However getting transplant goes survivability regression.

There's many go around, goes priority. fat person would still receive transplant everyone else get's first.  Basically impossible. Convalescent plasma, however, covid recovered patients shown _help_ infected, though! Yeah got booster i'm feeling pretty good. Luckily cases low high vaccination rates schools good protocols place. really relax though children get vaccine. No, vaccine shown produce much robust antibody response. vaccine protects ever infected lower risk severe illness. I‚Äôd wait 6 since you‚Äôre immunocompromised yourself, definitely antibodies.

US recommending 8 months. UK saying 6, certain people (and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd even eligible you‚Äôd high risk live someone HIV, transplant recipient specific immunosuppressant drugs).  Israel ones boosters available 5 months.

COVID especially Delta's superpower long period presymtomatic spread. Vaccines blunt transmission far better masks.

Luckily, [we choose single mitigation Bone loss also happen natural hormone, testosterone, sources diminished, hence HRT. wonder connection COVID testosterone production. Yeah, hear ya. fever 103.5 felt horrible good 36 hours. I‚Äôm scheduling booster Friday first experience‚Ä¶ generally speaking agree, employers (be government private) allow employees take 2 days shot without using sick time, little hope ever happen assume I‚Äôll future one Friday throwing away weekend. healthcare worker doesn‚Äôt believe medial treatments produces‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt much lost. 

It bit sad fell propaganda, need held standard considering do. judge people gotten vaccine way people seen much extreme. nut jobs sure, loud face especially social media, much minority. Memory cells rather antibodies. months vaccination infection, antibodies floating around bloodstream, long they're needed, body kill save resources (apoptosis name process, cell useless it'll kill itself, failure mechanism part causes cancers IIRC) However, memory (T?) cells remember make antibodies. Whilst got antibodies bloodsteam looking fight, difficult infection (bacterial viral) get even foothold. antibodies seppukue'd, infection take hold memory cells started manufacturing new antibodies, case viral infection, larger viral load symptoms time body starts attacking invaders. Still massive improvement mechanism start generating antibodies upon infection like anyone cautches pre-vaccination go through. people going sterilize masks. They're COVID wards there's need. sterilizing procedure us non-health care people keep 4 rotation, done hang dry 3 days. virus laden aerosols trapped mask dried viruses deaded that. state; ""Roll Tide"" thank you! Thanks! TIL lmao buy it, media drop FUD tomorrow keep confused, scared tuned Thanks qualification.  fact BS sniffed database collecting categorizing clear air direct evidence moving forward scientifically.  think you‚Äôre wrong ‚Äúsmall bump‚Äù I‚Äôm fully expecting another big wave, you‚Äôre right CDC. could get bad last December even won‚Äôt stop people gathering Christmas. less new cases

beware reporting, many cases reinfections. media/gov never let end, move life. youre vaxxed over. ""blame others"" strategy old human civilization yet still works.  exactly thought lmao 'went bad'?

&amp;#x200B;

***You mean, 'went exactly expected anyone working brain/at least 2 working brain cells'?!*** think paper invalidates claim -- paper using 70C dry heat way sterilize mask. people understand masks work going use soapy water steam sterilize.  O'Delta rules! mRNA sequence identical.

Nitpick, mRNA sequences [aren't quite  Well MN hit highest cases since fall 21 cases go again! Meantime CDC employees enjoy Thanksgiving person families. whats mean?

you saying reported 30k deaths? Wanna know give two fucks? laws vaccinated. everything right. One trip Arizona (masked public) gave Delta. one gets spend 2021 relearning walk, fighting lung scarring best souvenir remind ONE MATTERS ALL. 
I care even others don‚Äôt. Yes wait antibiotic resistant bacteria pandemic emerge humanity face monster long forgotten.  quarantining right away infection? nothing vaccination. That's dumb. Yep, wait see. plenty examples places including Northeast states UK cases already started rise time last year yet done year. pattern combination environmental factors (decrease sun) human patterns lockdowns unlocks levels drop. much bizarre unjustifiable state pride. Football fucking religion - it‚Äôs surreal experience.

It ain't unjustifiable got many championships, Roll Tide. don‚Äôt understand refuse vaccine they‚Äôre clamoring monoclonal antibodies. 

The monoclonal antibodies still EUA, FDA approved (like Pfizer vaccine). 

I mean things say vaccines: 
I‚Äôm sure don‚Äôt know monoclonal antibody treatments - probably never even looked ingredients list. 
Do know side-effects are? know long-term effects monoclonal antibodies? even know long monoclonal antibodies stay system? 
While monoclonal antibody treatments past, question treatments brand new virus developed quickly?

To clarify, I‚Äôm saying monoclonal antibodies bad, effective treatment wonderful reducing chance hospitalization need them. question things vaccine aren‚Äôt asking questions monoclonal antibodies? I'm nervous timetable. J&amp;J saying 2-6 months boosters, mean folks already past 6 month timeline? people already gotten first J&amp;J, right? Considering whole pause fiasco. going COVID deaths entire USA year.   Delta asshole. *our* asshole. Exactly, NZ Greenland toughest countries spreading disease. Nobody knows that, based spike mutations far ability shown mutate ways enhance endocytosis idea seems incorrect. Same. AZ + Moderna + Canada. noticed strange powers yet. missed point entirely again...
 broken logic hilarious dont think trying clever. Seems like blissfully ignorant. I'll ask again. think anyone listen opinion? curiosity dying know people like think. Feel free answer stupid that's simplest answer. mean, took months, among deadliest months. you‚Äôre saying could cause, still need see studies happened.

Btw vaxxed, I‚Äôm asking questions curiosity. 

I keep forgetting political reddit echo chamber become, mean offend question anyone‚Äôs choices.  Wonder applies AZ + Moderna.

I know, know, Canada showing. Go on.. meh. real estate already cheap there. can't believe real. world person get position power? Maybe took away definitely took advantage lack rationality. Well legal argument OSHA derives powers Congress, can't something Congress can't Congress appointed do.

That's much ""in nutshell"" summary. takeaway, though, nearly straight forward making sound.

On top this, OSHA required follow number procedural rules would delay thing long practical. example, they're supposed ""comment period"" enact new protocol industry, unions, public, etc. comment. they're supposed review comments X days respond, forth.

So get bypass that, legal mechanism allows that?

There's reason effect already. England, it‚Äôs spelled ‚Äúborcester shot‚Äù    That's true actually. live Thailand see people coming quarantine need to, tourism allowed. fuck wrong you?? humans. dying born ""Good."" public workspace.  It‚Äôs better $7.25 get south parts country. Good.  


It's choice problem part solution; hope enjoy consequences actions. piss poor &amp; touch messaging public health officials? president promised vaccine passports/mandates broke promises? local officials spit face ""the science"" invoke arbitrary mask rules highly vaccinated places? delusional crazies, demonize fuels fire. wonder unvaccinated people remain unconvinced.  Religion - secular education = lack knowledge healthcare

Maybe I‚Äôm formula wrong.  Defence Defense far concerned whole ‚ÄúVaccine Hesitant‚Äù thing crock shit used put milder spin fools aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated.   
Anyone get vaccination choosing personal reasons point self centred piece shit.   
We know true effects vaccination individual based populations.    
This whole, it‚Äôs personal choice affecting anyone else line rubbish.   
We society calling people assholes are.  me. Almost identical. 103 fever, shaking like leaf: horrible. Felt heart palps weeks after. Really hoping Pfizer booster yeah, vacationers go nobody stops people going maskless want spend money. mean‚Ä¶ Alabama among worst nation maternal mortality, infant mortality, general health, poverty rates, general family well being, dozens things. 

But Bear Bryant Nick Saban, that.

Priorities, guess.  would show math point would understand it. believe want believe justify world view believe trials done adult subjects, initially answer likely no, available kids. Hopefully though, adult version approved, begin trials children.  J&amp;J here. covid last March also (2020). shot killed me. Would get hoping Pfizer Moderna booster point. Hope data set strong.  OMG, that's hilarious. Drawn journalism, quartered bandwagons. Aw shit. sucks hear. Dose 2 knocked ass 4 days. Fever, chills, sweats, awful body aches, nausea, lightheadedness, migraine, brain fog. felt like shorter version last super intense flu years back. Awful shit, lol.

I scheduled 4 days preparation. Hopefully it‚Äôs much worse! 

We‚Äôll see though! Waiting COVID test results. :D here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôs negative far it‚Äôs spreading coworkers vaxxed, direct contact both. Anyone says ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs money‚Äù regards 6 week hospital stay showing ignorance. clearly idea DRG payment structure works. conspiracy theorists even go hospital all? 

Keep Covid-infected loved one home, dose horse warmer essential oils, give somebody else much needed hospital bed. one it, need boosters not.

Sorry attitude completely exhausted COVID. Dealing employees customers complete nightmare trying protect balancing everything else. LA forcing vaccine mandates, force tons people Orange County nearby area vaccinated too, since lot people living area work LA go LA meet friends etc. Yeah, sorry. Way, way, way many people fail consider long term disabilities kind, especially immediately visible like wheelchair something. trying encourage vaccinations. trying protect customers. owner enacted mandatory vaccine policy anyone wants dine-in coffee shop. Jackson said policy response grandmother nearly dying COVID-19 last year.¬†

""That 96 days saying goodbye her, want anyone go I've gone it. want anyone go losing someone store,"" said Jackson. Yup! true!

That said, saying I'm religious, see totally different prayer warriors. believe Creator given certain people within medical community talent, education drive develop medications vaccines need order keep us healthy. Also, case covid-19 vaccines, talent ability vaccines developed quick manner sheer genius! opinion, feel lucky people ability us! I'm extremely grateful people! Yes, Sweden's case, vaccines available. Also, think Moderna vaccine choice country. Exactly. places don‚Äôt one places do‚Ä¶ would think behave lack discussion least, never want let go. kills public buy in. First flat earth trying sound intelligent interviews without saying much, this.

He really way deep conspiracy theories.  see requirements sticking around spring. Vaccines children still month away beginning, really see benefits late year. Shots children five still seem months away. Boosters adults looking likely probably means three shots required count toward fully-vaccinated statistics. really looking like two full years restrictions US (March 2020-March 2022) really sucks. nursing board plenty nurses asked moderate raises seeing wages paid traveling nurses denied. wonder many hospitals complaining staffing want raise wages commiserate demand. 5 soooooo, want boy kidney girl. Got two dogs needs anything. 


 I'm going hell I? Difference mandates things school/college movie theaters argument smoking lung gets destroyed. Works obvious reasons. kidney gets destroyed getting vaccine doesn't. I'm vaccinating many people possible, heck I'm even vaxxed myself. still health! people might stupid reasons get vaccinated, affect benefits transplant. medical decision Gattaca one impacted ~~patients~~ childs health.

Gattaca two chdren one genetically optimized (as depicted norm) not, instead born ""love child"" CDC guidelines 3-5 days exposure, good get tested now. tell union they're low seniority. union help toss shipping dock. sister (a nurse) pregnant got booster last week. concerned risks mother baby catching covid. common 2nd shot rather 1st? FL vaccine mandates. See Leon County information. They‚Äôre legal nationwide via federal law US constitution saying federal law overrides state law. There‚Äôs nothing FL that.

So, it‚Äôs totally possible Miami vaccine mandates. Well think conversation expands vaccine equity worldwide, US spreads supply chain thin. That‚Äôs good news.

Unquestionably that's large part it.  think blame shared originating messaging (public officials scientific medical experts) mangling message pass along... poll pre-vaccine similar results regarding likelihood hospitalization. crazy ... like no, 50% positive tests end hospital. That's even right higher age groups. want say let em it, work feel like they'll try sue malpractice using unproven treatment. wonder long took...did say article?

I agree uncomfortable conversation need now. much hate say I've started believing longer afford push back treatments prevention unvaccinated covid patients - logical extension argument need establish guiding principles get hand. 

If something established permanent (i.e.: believe getting vaccine/booster every 6 months 5 years telling obese person lose weight) essentially step 1 treatment prevention, think essentially becomes refusing treatment get make sense put people like back line needed. analogy use covid like natural disaster vaccine last Coast Guard helicopter. take helicopter, able come back you. People need medical procedures lest accumulate backlog 2+ years undiagnosed unprevented illnesses. already know 3 people cancer serious illnesses got worse detection solely routine appointments screenings delayed. picking anti vaxxers, displacing people can't go get vaccine problems. 

That said, agree kind limit. easy, safe, effective treatment decline it, think bad you. treatment becomes harder follow, less proven, need aware dividing medical system based nebulous idea merit. obesity alcoholism easily preventable?

Makes sense agree also think religion lots also.  remember people freely chose place situation affects puts anyone comes near risk. pulled number of? guessing somewhere low. data seen far number people willing walk job facing vaccine mandates insignificant percentage.  guess makes statement individuals come power ""quid pro quo"" responsible individuals society? isnt good hill die on.     So... individuals comply, saying? well listen local state dph stuff try make good decision do. u realize touch? thought touch moment said dont need wear masks. That's point, frankly passes probably change anyways. 

Vaccines supposed get us point lower risk enough mitigations necessary, do. see highly vaccinated areas Delta surge minor effect death rates. Even Provincetown cluster people vaccinated zero deaths associated it. 

Vaccine mandates way forward, spending societal political capital on. Masks inefficient losing proposition divert attention away actually effective long term mitigations. They‚Äôre pro-vax then. Vaccine mandates something we‚Äôve lifetimes. standard procedure decades. Donor organs are, sadly, rare - one becomes available must wasted. Hence recipient fully vaccinated, non-smoker, willing adhere diet etc. etc.    entirely true. can‚Äôt speak everyone, want go effect, work restaurant industry definitely required check people. bartender former server, learned early checking people something issue time time, especially beginning, like everything else life get used learn best deal it. people retail service deal crazy people crazy situations time, doubt really much different we‚Äôve handling throughout entire pandemic. Idaho probably know Governor Lt. Governor run separate tickets voted independently. Gov. Little choose McGeachin accounts despises her.  basically John Locke\`s dad should!  world already existed 50+ years: vaccines required attend schools since early days polio vaccine.

The challenge people probably forgot many vaccines received required child.

The main difference it‚Äôs enforced non school things (which unnecessary past vaccines school mandates reached sufficient percentage f population). [Citation needed] got mine yesterday strangely, booster hitting harder first 2. zero symptoms first, lump injection site second body really like booster. 

My whole upper bicep pretty tender arm hurts overall. little twinge side chest pain side got injection mostly move arm quickly certain direction.  feel really fatigued overall. got 4 hours restless sleep gave up. I'm able wfh, real brain fog lethargic limbs super thrilled moving like want to. I'm basically resigned creeping around apt like grandma feel better. 

I expecting pretty smooth sailing based first 2 shots third affecting like surprising. usually feel pretty crummy flu shot (which got year already fine)and affecting actually little bit worse that.

Would still get booster knowing symptoms, worse, possibility? 

Absolutely. sucks covid worse. school-based mandate long term effect, everyone goes school, can't get un-vaccinated vaccinated matter type potato hold injection site put socks.

The problem kind policy takes generations, time Oh see. It‚Äôs rapidly escalating Canada, neighbours north. It‚Äôs crisis Alberta Saskatchewan right now. several countries. guess that‚Äôs surprised. DEBT CEILING RARGERBARGLERAGLE!!!!

...whew, sorry, get system.  Probably combination delta people letting guard relaxing restrictions. Well arm hurts bit feel little weak that‚Äôs okay avoids potential death.  Delta, think. Last year could avoid catching it, infectious, everyone‚Äôs getting either vaccine infection, unvaccinated infected pretty likely die. staff practicing good hygiene require masks, saving lives allowing unvaxxed customers eat there. (I'm assuming already required staff get vaxxed)

Hygiene nothing it. can't eat/drink reliable way confirm vaccination business. lot vaxxed customers card them, required business county. Unvaxxed may go trouble fake spite them.

You're letting perfect enemy better. People use fake drivers licenses, birth certificates, passports, etc buy restricted items. unvaccinated people either go there, take coffee go.

Also, keep photo vaccination card phone. official, I've pulled doctor's visits really care. good stance promote vaccination, division.

Good you? her. obligation, even interest, stance is. want promote vaccination, guest.  empathy people want never ones job. Put position vaccine carding everyone enters target walmart mall. enough money planet pay job. beginning covid outbreak many people began wearing masks, congress mandated masks floor Democrats wore them. Republicans didn't. republican congresscritters came covid Dem colleagues didn't. Someone hinterlands suggested since republicans getting sick Democrats conspiracy.

They've bet chips vaccines harmful, information bear hide behind ""free-dumb"". want people see geniuses believe are, barring *don't* want admit gullible morons duped grifter trying discredit *one* vaccine sell others sponsored by.

It's purely, 100% pride them. way get either find way get vaccine without admit wrong (which we're seeing lot people get vaccine mandate - blame Biden ""forcing"" them), break pride point get vaccine eating thick slice humble pie. And? feel differently shot? Hey, people want take Ivermectin, let them. fight supply horsey set. Yeah get jobs tough essential work isn‚Äôt always desirable work either. think fight dies people don‚Äôt feel like agenda them, vaccine mandates won‚Äôt really stop jobs getting done. Study peer-reviewed smallpox vaccine required enter mall restaurant? Hmm... Sweden saying get vaccinated, get vaccinated Moderna. might much better AstraZeneca instead.  like read studies I‚Äôll let draw conclusions - 36% natural infections result antibodies therefore confer future protection. Vaccination consistently - first ‚Äòmyth‚Äô bust regarding natural immunity vs vaccination specifically regards Delta directly refutes exact study - helps explain vaccinated people might show ‚Äúhigher‚Äù infection rates. particular line ‚ÄúBecause vaccines 100% effective, number people fully vaccinated goes up, number vaccine breakthrough infections also increase‚Äù. initially thought study might making false assumption understand wasn‚Äôt it‚Äôs first time I‚Äôve seen claim made assumed - study gave ‚Äòtwice likely‚Äô stat yes, sample size small study also peer reviewed doesn‚Äôt rely flawed methodology.     Maybe write articles CNBC hear that? Everything i've seen sitting around 80-84% even Delta. Whereas yesterday, saw pfizer wanes 54% Delta 3 months. anything controversial this. enough organs go around. Giving people inarguably CHOSEN put crosshairs dangerous virus, makes sense all. 

It would far unethical allow transplants go forward.  followed science 100% shutting everyone inside house 2 weeks, society would‚Äôve literally collapsed. anti-vaxers/maskers running self-righteous rampage poor minimum wage people enforce this... need strictly enforced legal teeth hope helping things. Disneyland? I'm really ready require proof vaccination. Guess beauty without brains They're usually physicians, nurses assistants even janitors hospitals reluctant. Every single doctor old hospital got vaccinated, honestly ‚Äústragglers‚Äù got ton shit docs vaccinated late January. go look vaccination rates physicians whole, it‚Äôs like 98% includes lot folks don‚Äôt even see patients like pathologists diagnostic radiologists. doesn‚Äôt matter doesn‚Äôt wane protection worse. Last heard 30% delta variant. Idk much pfizer ‚Äúwanes‚Äù, doubt it‚Äôs much less protective  Ok lets follow scenario. wearing mask required enough reason escorted site lets say kind ""ruckus"" like IDK rude angry asshole.

""Can see vaccine card please?"" 

""Here go (expletive)"" like expect ""(expletives)"" followed light hard violence.

I believe South Carolina better vaccination rate Queensland well.  Uh fuck. Yissss. wish hospitals would flat refuse even treat people unvaccinated.  Transplant organs short supply. Therefore first go people likely well rather wasting people likely die.. always requirements getting transplant, including vaccinations various diseases. I'm aware anyone crying discrimination vaccine requirements covid-19. suddenly people screaming one vaccine ridiculously politicized. immediate reaction vaccine, something could occur later on, vaccine? Let‚Äôs hope happens! Another great question! First, look context. UK Israel national health programs consistent set information across country.

I‚Äôm seeing many getting breakthrough cases, including least one teenager vaccinated June. Everyone ok though long lasting effects. really like illness point  three months worth people infected, moreso measurement vaccinated vs. unvaccinated previously infected, vaccine's relative effectiveness could appear lower even really unchanged be

Where'd get booster? hear you. hard. Frustrating. Tiring. want over. actually, many it, almost be, except new normal bit different. fully vaccinated, there's LOTS do, exceptions....if immunosuppressed, certain age (we know what, depends risk tolerance), live someone is, wearing masks sometimes, basically there. people immunosuppressed older, going harder, upping mask game N95/KN95 equivalent give lot freedom.

Ultimately risk/benefit. Would go restaurant meal that's important me? No. Would go restaurant meal that's important me, outdoor in-home dining option. Yes, depending context. Hospital: ‚ÄúDid get COVID vaccine?‚Äù
 
Unvaccinated person: ‚ÄúUm, yes.‚Äù

Hospital: ‚ÄúAlrighty then. Enjoy new heart.‚Äù

If someone ‚Äúlost‚Äù vaccination card even way verify this? correct - mean she'll get it. likely given get vaccinated. 

Likewise, chances successful transplant much higher smoke, drink, generally stays healthy. taking precautions mean transplant fail, makes chances much greater.

So what's difference? requiring things except vaccine acceptable intended promote thing - successful outcome??

One likely scenario see flares outbreaks, especially places like nursing homes, prisons, homeless shelters, camps, vaccines and, much lesser degree, treatments, virus tamed cause nearly death destruction causes now.

A better scenario would much lower transmission, worse would new variant evades immunity.

I'm absolutely expert memory cells come play fresh antibodies need generated. understanding comes play ""infection"" actually occurs. words going keep catching virus. getting boosters. stop infection, need sky high antibodies already present. said, far understand, ramifications body generating antibodies post infection, keeping infection mild, keeping hospital. Pfizer Moderna excellent regard. edge we've seen Moderna simply produces antibodies, last longer. Yet still wane, same. anything might mean need booster often example. headline about. layman interpretation. far better asking professional /r/COVID19. Great question! Would need know lot more, short answer well protected may still need careful. Here's detail:

1. Assume got 2 doses Pfizer, chose get third Moderna. That's recommended, understandable.
2. immunosuppressed, especially organ transplant, protection much less, others. third vaccine probably helps somewhat, change reality.
3. around people older immunosuppressed, still spread virus them, even vaccinated even symptoms, much less likely.
4. terms safety, unless (we know age, maybe 75 80) health problems, unlikely get seriously ill Covid. hand, even ""mild"" Covid picnic many people, long Covid real risk.

Bottom line: well protected, still need careful! Good. dont deserve saved. almost mild infections. reported reported mild infections produce result. problem J&amp;J moderate overlaps significantly Pfizer others called mild.  feel like probably big reason pushing vaccine transplant. person wanted vaccine fact would likely way less effective even booster shots. 

The article headline makes sound much harsh reality. Someone **TOLD** infections disease spreading could spoken personal doctor, weighed benefits, got vaccine tragedy took place. safe?

Vaccination mandates key healthy safe return life. know read dark dystopian novel find thinking ‚Äúwow. I‚Äôm glad don‚Äôt live world.‚Äù

This lot antivax groups people really feel vaccine mandates quarantine measures. Like rebel hero everyone else mindlessly giving government controlled future. stop living amongst society refusing vaccine. Something haven‚Äôt really (consciously) witnessed before.

I really don‚Äôt know explain people think way. Yeah sounds like scary reality, ain‚Äôt it. wearing mask simple gesture keeps rates down. cases arent declining everywhere.  least long term.  Cases declining week big deal well gone 3 months.  1000 deaths US almost every day.  Trend lines wayyy up.

Its like gas prices - spike instantly go slowly.  hard tell trend.  Also vaccine rates though well.  trickle best. Let define question.

My parents age one got booster. require fly see entails traveling (close contact, high risk exposure). Id like see seems like way increase protection getting infected back close 90%. Without taking booster, seems like get there. like denying alcoholic kidney transplant. Especially said alcoholic making attempt quit alcohol. i'm 32 eligible (type one diabetic). got 2nd pfizer march 9 got booster walgreens. reason COVID deadly completely novel immune system. past 18 months, population gained substantial immunity (either vaccination infection). virus longer novel vast majority us. Sure, antibodies wane time, like every virus, cells B cells keep strong reason infection virus rarely causes severe illness people whose immune systems previously exposed way. virus doesn‚Äôt need mutate become less lethal. fact it‚Äôs longer novel immune systems reduces severity it. City County? I'm lazy. Yup, zero doctor ordered it.  Oct 15 FDA advisory board going examine data discussion mix match boosters. NIH study it. Totally right, would get less clicks, translates currency, outrage becomes product one wants we‚Äôre addicted to. I'm pro-vaccine anti-mask, long I'm vaccinated.   powers squirrel girl.

That probably radioactive squirrel bit me, though. vaccine. Forever, no.

For duration semester; likely.

Till spring break 2022, reasonably likely.

&amp;#x200B;

Generally speaking, colleges requiring masks locations county/state immunity levels high enough (gotta 88% Delta, based combination fully vaxxed previously infected might help make informed guess; select ascertainment bias 3, click fully vaxxed checkbox get data college likely working from. 

If comfortable sharing, I'm glad provide finer-grained guesstimate overall immunity state... maybe list 3 states I'll share data each? 

&amp;#x200B;

If college planning sending y'all home early, likely gonna go bit overboard avoid train-wreck finals week.

When y'all return January, local cases likely downtrend yet another peak; peak end high y'all *might* able start fresh.  think might much cred actual credits. 70 minutes according quit jobs income?

No unemployment vaccine refusal. government program back up. people cave second gets little uncomfortable. people don‚Äôt actually care much think refusing vaccine. Even vaccines according Israeli study get breakthrough case 19% likely develop long covid.

Ugh, I've wondering while.

It's nice see death rates low, fun see virus still puncher's chance fuck brain get it. discovered way (gattaca-style) make genetic tweaks ensured person would much reduced chance disease transfer future -- would okay mandate (or deny services person receive genetic tweak)? 


If safe effective vaccines, yes. 


It's difficult question. Humanity thought century came unequivocal yes answer, like we've pretty much settled Paradox Tolerance back 60s. Hand wringing Reddit suddenly make conundrum again. talent ability vaccines developed quick manner sheer genius

If god bit quicker give us knowledge people wouldn‚Äôt died, huh? Guess busy giving babies HIV cancer? i‚Äôm curious implications people can‚Äôt get vaccinated whatever medical reasons many mid level managers  Actually Kyrie vaccinated, however Uncle Drew vaccinated guys think discriminatory pose threat lives?

This much discrimination requiring driver's license operate motor vehicle. agree can‚Äôt say definitively think bigger takeaway it‚Äôs flawed study can‚Äôt really used evidence support anything.

I‚Äôm also gonna say CDC stated unvaccinated individuals twice likely contract COVID vaccinated I‚Äôm sure 13x came timeframe study conducted.

If data gathered period relaxed restrictions (which Delta concern most) could also explained fact one wearing masks vaccinated people infected contagious version.

Ultimately, natural immunity not, there‚Äôs downside vaccination wouldn‚Äôt also happen severe way got COVID there‚Äôs really compelling reason get one unless LIKE way things going mandates people losing jobs want see get worse.

That seems like it'd newsworthy. Define ""need"" ""boosters"".

We certainly want 3-dose system everyone; third dose going better 24/7 mask we're telling people now. Sorry attitude completely exhausted COVID.

Yeah, completely normal.  I‚Äôd amazed anyone NZ AUS didn‚Äôt know NSW meant. mild concern mask mandates across country following CDC‚Äôs recommendation wear masks areas high/substantial transmission (defined seen here: 
  
But problem lies tying mandate cases. we‚Äôve seen UK, it‚Äôs possible indefinitely get stuck time relatively high transmission, deaths/hospitalizations. Per capita, UK higher cases US past months, got rid mask mandate. delta‚Äôs high transmission rate vaccines mostly strong protection severe disease, cases still happening ""Hospital system""

That's works. That's works. Private healthcare dumbass. Fucking karma farmers. crazy. describe absolutely possibility. understand, scientists believe likely.

But happens, we'll get boosters. far worse outcomes. So, reproduce proficiently 37C lab ""survives"" worse 37C?

Because 37C human body, *have* survive hours, find infect cell matter minutes less. infection, cells spit new virions less immediately infect another cell. transmission, cells spit virions transferred relatively quickly droplets whatever methods virus capable surviving through, get someone else's body, immediately infect reasons replicates within body; namely ""there cells think want they'll pick long chance decay"".

While definitely benefit virus survives longer higher temperatures it'd increase transmissibility think there'd selection pressure would make inevitable, probable coronaviruses never developed trait whatever changes necessary would come cost trait that's far beneficial them, ability masquerade undetected infiltrate victim cells.

At point, got start de-escalating. distinct lineages now, way noteworthy surprising. fact matter mutations still covered vaccines developed pre-D614G strains says all. simply apply influenza. Why? Pfizer damn fine job well. Long term immunity seems possible unless youre talking infections, Moderna Pfizer likely wane due waning antibodies.   That‚Äôs due variety things. immune system changes develops functions better grow up.

It also gets lot memory built vaccines minor major infections, get reinfected something you‚Äôve (or close relative it) often fight much better faster. Plus, kids bodies general still developing - smaller hearts/lungs/other organs, high oxygen needs - cold develop pneumonia croup lot easier kid.

(I think that's probably meant, distinction important.) Medical treatment Canada based triage, first come first served. low numbers last winter also worked way. travel hospitality mostly restricted everywhere except Florida, many people flocked state vacationers. Yet Florida‚Äôs outbreak numbers remained modest.

However, anecdotally, personally knew 3 different people visit florida last winter came back infected. people infected Covid florida, returned home test positive add state‚Äôs numbers.  Covid spreading florida last winter, wasn‚Äôt recorded there.   average rate infection. think alpha R0 2.5 someone contagious would pass average 2.5 people. Delta, depending ask, R0 4 **9!!** 

So average 6.5 average R0 spread delta means contagious people infecting another 6.5 people. That's amazingly unsustainable 6.5 people go infect another 6.5 people. reinfections occur. infection means increased chance unlucky mutation (much like delta came there's mutations going time) means could get something worse delta and/or could get mutation somehow manages negate vaccine's protection :/ Moderna protection held well delta, Pfizer booster shores protection well get immediately (in US, is). basically try find way qualify, since CDC interpreted guidelines broadly.

We've known viruses work almost century. told us wear masks beginning pandemic, knew masks help stop viral spread since 1920's. thing vaccine boosters.

Stop apologizing complete utter incompetency.  Technically yes, practically speaking, maybe/kinda. someone check's state's registry, show up. card look like normal CDC card, people might reject it. think countries recognize it. travel outside country still avoiding restaurants/bars/concerts, matter. outside US, 26 bucks. laws US labcorp wanna say like 60 90. cheaper ones usually line, number. jail sound fun ü§© 
Yes get difference smallpox eradicated single shot dozens rest life. little bit difference agree? There's going herd immunity hopefully find ways treat it, better vaccines target variants directly. Pray tell, new data convinced change position boosters last two weeks? Stop apologizing complete utter incompetency. COVID fevers worse.  Oh sure, like told us wear masks turned another lie ""for greater good"" ended killing people.  AZ Moderna. AZ live virus can't replicate, adenovirus (type cold virus), SARS2 spike proteins added.

I really shitty night getting AZ vaccine. peak deaths winter occurred early January 2021, deaths would people got infected around Christmas 2020. Meaning very, would vaccinated people.

As remainder deaths recently 2021, vast majority unvaccinated people (mostly south). January 2021 far worst month US COVID terms deaths, followed February 2021; people vaccinated point (the general population really start getting vaccines March) dont disagree say pretty much every disease Article includes medical exemptions doubt. ACE2 receptors everywhere. like norovirus there's specific cells replicate nowhere else generally body, one-and-done day. Justifying someone's death? Bruh, evil.  think missing point. trying convey cannot always science says optimal. Obviously covid contained, animal reservoirs well. still stands though could effectively eliminate covid within area literally welded everyone's doors shut/shut border etc. ideas absurdly impractical shatter parts people's lives, violate rights etc. Merely illustrate point
  
In similar vein: could forcefully give everyone vaccine. safe effective would curb pandemic. we?
  
There multiple ways approach COVID. advocate vaccine mandates. bet would definitely curb transmission. problems mandates? power mandate them? responsibility fed government? State? County? Induvidual Businesses? mandates vs incentives? 
  
All say unreasonable hesitation mandates, even would work effectively curb covid. Policy implementation balancing act science, public messaging, human behavior, individual freedoms etc. know good dozen. But, none worse flu really mild (including myself) none long covid lasting effects, taste/smell returned, commonly takes months unvaccinated.  


I also state many break cases well prior 6 months last shot, really confident getting booster solution. fight supply horsey set.

Hey, I'm horsey set! Ironically, horsey set AntiVax Conservative friends Feed store buy horse wormer, etc. One reasons refuse get vaccinated believe Medical field &amp; Big Pharma hyping Covid *""to make money...*"" exploiting Covid selling huge quantities horse wormer likely used people Covid! mean given Blacks Hispanics overwhelmingly vote Blue they're affected covid/Vaccine ""hesitant"" compared whites split, likely no.   No, voter laws changed states. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, lot spread deaths happened densely populated cities, minority groups, normal working people can't afford go work. think there's big death differentially given includes pre-Vacccine winter wave. even 100% deaths one political party, still big difference since less 1% people died. also hill *he literally die on.* that's none business.

You see impact Flu Season, look closely, also see impact social distancing comparing Flu Season 2019/202 2020/2021. Flu Season Oct 1 April 1.

The 2020/2021 flue season close easily get numbers matching time frame COVID vaccine available. Granted, widely available time frame, available many at-risk groups. 2021/2022 flu season offer better comparison, best get point. Oct. 1 2020 April 1 2021, first year vaccine existed viruses social behaviors exist viruses:

* Flu deaths: 646 (from COVID deaths: 356,000

In last month Flu Season 2020/2021 alone (March 2021):

* Flu deaths: 81
* COVID deaths: 25868

COVID Deaths literally 300x higher flu deaths flu season period vaccines exist both, much higher outside flu season.

COVID **NOT** flu. even close.  So, understanding papers read T-cell response better AZ either pre-fusion spike mRNA vaccines. So, body theory respond faster infected cells.

The downside? Slightly lower antibodies AZ somewhat less effective virus fused cell yet.

Even vaccines according Israeli study get breakthrough case 19% likely develop long rare occurrences could also develop loss taste/smell vaccine 6+ funny people vaccinated look normal anti-vaxers already look like mutants.

As many people stated post, obscene number requirements recieve organ transplant. transplant precious gift someone died provide. one small reasonable addition list. would much rather see someone dangerous neighborhood get organ demonstrated follow doctors orders make good faith attempt live healthy honor donor someone gets medical advice facebook.  haven‚Äôt downvoted you. think posts Unpopular around here. 

The fact clue long illnesses might last. wasn‚Äôt talking long Covid. get double pneumonia you‚Äôre 50 could well last rest life. end vent many times you‚Äôre never same. look full picture could happen get Covid get truly sick never fully recover. It‚Äôs death need worry  transplant recipient need take anti-rejection medication life prevent body rejecting transplant. medication reduces recipients ability fight infection went ahead transplant caught COVID would good chance would survive; vaccinated chances recovery would much higher.

Their argument religious exception laughable, recipient donor taking multiple medications facilitate transplant. guarantee development medications used fetal cells used development COVID vaccines. religious grounds rejecting COVID vaccines grounds preclude going forward transplant.

Vaccine mandates nothing new, deemed multiple occasions legal; restrictions conditions transplants nothing new, done ensure best outcomes may see harsh need keep mind organ transplants limited supply, includes resources perform transplant support recipient, must ensure best outcome transplant strict rules place.

To study authors:

As epidemiologist, reviewing paper publication would send back major revisions reject outright. would even bother looking results.

The major issue conditioned study group entry event happens end study. I.e. created cohort unvaccinated persons must remain unvaccinated throughout study. guaranteed introduce selection bias, specifically immortal-time bias. guarantees biased estimate. topic written many times. Cf many articles Sammie Souza McGill.

Imagine someone unvaccinated cohort. Soon initial study date develop infection. 5 weeks later recovered decided vaccine, get one. insisted group remain vaccine free throw group lose data. thrown infection. times guaranteed ‚Äòvaccinated‚Äô group reporting many infections actually experienced. easily accounts effect report.

Note happen fully vaccinated/boosted group must receive vaccinations prior study entry. capture every infection drop out. Thus you‚Äôve created situation non-random drop-out groups. selection bias.

To get around problem MUST use methods Cox proportional hazards modeling time-varying exposure variables persons move cohorts based exposure vaccine study period.

In Denmark general medical consensus risk vaccine outweighed reward person getting vaccine *only*, sort societal reward, lower risk COVID transfer young healthy person vulnerable person would counted reward offset risk young healthy person.

So would risk contracting COVID risk serious injury death COVID contracted time stopping vaccine able give another one, compared risk serious side effects vaccine.

Since risk contracting COVID low (very low case rate Denmark), risk serious injury mortality low (no deaths age range), Pfizer given pretty much immediately instead, means even tiniest increase risk serious injury vaccine compared competitor high risk. reason AZ J&amp;J pulled general vaccine programme.

Meanwhile country primarily relying Moderna Pfizer available, case rate higher, children especially susceptible, benefits vaccine would outweigh risks absolutely accept Moderna vaccines.

The actual numbers yet released assume that's research paper decision made published yet. J&amp;J AZ vaccine pull (these many people would avoid hospitalisation/death, many people would hospitalised serious side effects, risk/reward make sense), I'd expect this. Hippocratic oath also non-binding, symbolic antiquated. Physicians operate principles of: Autonomy, Beneficence, Non-maleficence Justice.

http://cory-stieg.squarespace.com/ Sure, many generations, natural selection absence vaccines would lead resistant genes becoming prevalent. So? say myself, ‚ÄúHmm, I‚Äôm 5% poor innate resistance, I‚Äôd better let die gene pool become stronger‚Äù? No, I‚Äôm going protect others alive right now. Sorry, descendants. ""Religious exemptions"" beyond assisine. ""God told to, sorry"" 
""Ok worries"" There's always random factor there. whether worth taking another test really depends convenient is. Yeah sure!
Just wanted make sure necessary get another COVID Test.

Like would tested positive even though high fever happened later night COVID test? myocarditis rates vaccinated individuals end contracting Covid?

What odds unvaccinated young male contracting Covid developing myocarditis period year? guess, would rate myocarditis vaccine two separate events need happen here.  think (post) covid sequalae result autoantibody formation ACE2? not, think causes long-covid?

I know need data, curious thoughts. kidding. Good know, thanks! Helps prepare expect. :D insightful article, thank you. hope Biden Admin considers endorsing SMART health card framework; seems satisfy five requirements listed provides level standardization across various state managed immunization information systems. milder version pro mask anti-vaccine following sense: Ireland lock better Indonesia, England better Ethiopia. So, vaccine go first world initially. It‚Äôs funny cause doesn‚Äôt even get it. don‚Äôt want waiver liability getting sued something goes wrong. straight don‚Äôt want give kidney someone may waste it.

It‚Äôd like going car rental shop asking rent car you‚Äôll race local drag strip. thanks, don‚Äôt want risk cars, waiver necessary. Run day after, right rain. Felt 40% less crappy second shot made feel   Seems like it‚Äôs assumption based guess much explanation method ‚Äúconfirming‚Äù results inevitably create skewed data set. People anti-polio, dont think kids vaccinated go school? people?  There‚Äôs much wrong here, I‚Äôll focus key points.

First off, reason need flu shot every year many kinds flu viruses researchers try predict common ones year. That‚Äôs flu shot [only 40‚Äì60% effective importantly, isn‚Äôt laser tag you‚Äôre either hit hit, end story. infection effects along whole spectrum asymptomatic landing ICU dead. statistics clear vaccinated persons lower rate serious illness death result. [Take study 90% effectiveness (i.e. reduction rate compared unvaccinated persons) hospitalization least 6 months? Sure sounds like meaningful protection me.

Third, you‚Äôre mistaken think prior infection means vaccine useless you. [Vaccination infection markedly effective preventing reinfection infection go get vaccinated. possible US?  true!!! process, safeguards. Full approval requires 6 months data, took .... 6 months. Thank reply! Yes, currently take lisinopril control.  Thank question. news shows like this, I'm sure effective motivating people. One thing organization, Resolve Save Lives sharing stories people Long Covid - motivate young people get vaccinated. 

We think could helpful: expect mask mandates continue forever. individual level, may become common cold flu season. might see pockets covid (or flu, respiratory illnesses) campus people elect adopt masks time, think they'll become seasonal *requirement*. worse, campus (or employer) might *suggest* outbreaks.

Keep mind covid expected endemic out. still new virus, we're eventually going get handle it. do, much easier treat control way viruses. parents got booster flu shot together zero side effects sore arm. side effects second shot. get one 24hrs ask questions. legitimate religious exemptions, religion fairytale. Worst case still considerably higher 4 months, since third dose brings initial antibody titers way higher second dose worst case decay rate there. Annual boosters probably worst case point. Antivaxxers gonna use reason vax, he's simply beating punch killing argument dead make it. either or? problem. That's unfortunate throw translations Old Testament (Judiasm) completely different words.... vaccine free  great news. Proud Los Angelino. Got Pfizer booster yesterday. side effects first two shots, one absolutely wrecked me. I'm exhausted achy. I'm glad extra protection, goodness gracious. women mistaken thinking affects since direct donation donor fine vaccinations, transplant waiting list‚Äî one ‚Äúlosing out‚Äù kidney given unvaccinated person. isn‚Äôt them. 20 30% transplant patients get Covid die. die, need serious medical attention effort keep dying. include people need significant medical intervention end living. Basically, transplant patient gets Covid consume enormous amounts medical attention. serious healthcare worker shortage. hospital required risk expending workers don‚Äôt *really* two potential extremely serious Covid cases would require hospitalization risk easily mitigated. get transplant get Covid, hospital would treat them. would come expense patients need medical attention, expense healthcare workers already working many hours. Given probabilities (ie getting myocarditis Moderna vs getting myocarditis COVID), wouldn‚Äôt also argue don‚Äôt option - go Moderna? Fetal cell lines relevant ton drugs, development, testing. they‚Äôre immortalized decades ago anyway. whole thing infuriating rejecting pointless inconsistent. Good summary experience, getting booster 2 days ago, experienced symptoms Pfizer shot #2. sleep, chills, arm soreness, headache, muscle aches... But.. lasted 12 hours I'm left feeling little lethargic 99% back complete normal. able work all. last night walking around house chores usual routine. Kind amazing sudden side effects quickly began, atleast me... I‚Äôm quite sure understand. understood vaccines aren‚Äôt always 100% there‚Äôs always minuscule chance person could extremely negative fatal reaction it. said, would argue good outweigh bad, no? ah, really isn't. Transplant patients world required totally date vaccinations decades.

you need take anti rejection medications someone elses organ put . essentially knock immune system leave patient quite vulnerable virus' infectious diseases. 


Adding covid vax already long list required vaccinations hardly unexpected. effective lot anti-bad community LA Instagram models burnout surfers (based Instagram sample size). kind people born rich attractive slightest inconvenience breaks perceived exceptionalism allow posts singular individual. includes posts someone hospitalized, dying testing positive. think error, please modmail us.

Definitely don‚Äôt want waste kidney sure. vaccine puts higher risk group, that's fact. They've required kinds vaccines organ donations forever.

Which makes clueless. get completely board approach. we‚Äôre going allow transplants variety reasons (ie smokers, BMI, etc), non-vaxxed another one. part get worried it‚Äôs condition turned away.  coming former smoker. Exactly. Wouldn‚Äôt want give limited organ resource someone high risk getting sick dying covid quadruple agent immunosuppressive therapy. Even hospital models, technique matters. manufacturer oximeter got Amazon videos demonstrating proper use? 

Try inserting finger different ways find way gives consistent reading.

Another trick attach oximeter earlobe try get reading way. looked official numbers many doses delivered Sweden total far. 
Pfizer: 12 164 000,
Moderna: 3 532 000. 
Moderna used lot less common, become increasingly common. Almost half total number Moderna doses arrived September alone. I'm guessing friends got vaccines relatively recently.  mean, that's kinda point transplants, get saying. (pro-vax) Protestant myself, extremely based Bible. two main branches Christianity, Catholic Protestant.

In middle ages, Catholicism main branch, time become political power several practices viewed corrupt. Martin Luther created 95 theses, list practices. Protestantism arose ""protest"" practices related ideas.

The notable time indulgences, giving money church forgive sins. Today, notable difference debate whether Pope's words divine truth (the Catholic position) whether Bible divine truth (the Protestant position). Essentially, Protestant faith based Bible, whereas Catholic faith based Bible plus tradition plus words Popes. industry leaders considered raising wages attract employees? He's also missing practices, that's non-insignificant.

Is ""abandoning career?"" No, he's definitely throwing away year possibly jeopardizing future potential.

This kind thing GMs look favorably on. want people going put far ahead team trade/FA options limited moving forward. Yes, too. Seems like simple thing get kidney it. guess really hill people die on. Anyone got booster 20 30 years old range? I'm eligible sure booster yet. got 2nd Pfizer April 1st. heart transplant. thing required. Dumbass docked that. One study many referring supposed increased risk myocarditis currently received 3,355,200 doses Moderna 12,256,725 Pfizer, Pfizer far common, completely uncommon vaccinated Moderna here. Well, went Duke all, play couple games, left season never, ever graduate Duke institution. Antivaxers freedom choice someone chooses impose consequence. ""no, can't choose that,"" often heaping helping vitrol.  think means 97% relative measurement vaccinated vs. unvaccinated, discriminate unvaccinated previously infected unvaccinated never infected.

So, three months ago (when 'first month' measured) comparatively fewer people natural infection, vaccines effectiveness moreso measured effectiveness vs. unvaccinated never infected, effective comparison.

In last three months, three months worth people infected, moreso measurement vaccinated vs. unvaccinated previously infected, vaccine's relative effectiveness could appear lower even really unchanged measured population natural immunity first measurement.

Note: could wrong. NBA pretty fantastic vaccination rate overall.

Obviously individual anti-vax athlete going get press vaxxed athlete, like LeBron supporting vaccines even article obvious Irving one team vaccianted.

I guess point NBA far positive push negative one. There‚Äôs mixed scientific evidence long covid antibodies last system, robust immune response x amount time line. 
The bigger problem antibody tests aren‚Äôt reliable need prove immunity. There‚Äôs decently high false positive rate, means could tell you‚Äôre immune without actually immune. course he's vaccinated! believes earth flat. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.
