0,2020-09-14," Damn... Sounds rough Nobody really knows people get arrested get maximum sentences? hell say! going affect credibility American institutions like FDA CDC.

America credibility lose. ones taking folks seriously anymore. works works gives fuck Great explanation, thank you. misinformation? Bc one Atlantic writer said no? Dang. I'm sure CDC would've happy hand information you.  Oh me, I'm hatching brood brine shrimp shortly aquarium. Populations monolithic. risk-takers, cautious. risk-takers infected, curve decline. cautious people become risk-takers, curve increase again. Vlad go first! dont know believe difficult get tested. I've southeast US much year. Testing demand easy get, people getting tested choose so. someone symptoms mild, likely seek testing. seemed pretty normal co-workers. laughed lot masks. even met new set co-workers reassigned many people laid off, felt pretty normal me. feel like signs smiling, barely notice masks except really know new co-workers look like. Curious talking someone today what's like watch us outside. Like see rest world adjusting message US there's riots, crazy government people protesting pandemic etc. Watching news covering us must like watching post apocalyptic film. guess preserve hamster saturating tissues 500mL coca cola, neutralize coronavirus... Lmao article said ""The US close getting Covid-19 needs Winter"" would make sense none. Stop spreading pulled downplaying shit June also florida loosened restrictions people even wearing face masks anymore corona gone even though people still dying don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll get type increase. Long term care facilities major problem going stay high alert Chill man. Didn‚Äôt need bring Kashmir here. know Pakistanis can‚Äôt go two minutes without saying Kashmir. Lots wishful thinking. people believe would get country, increases cases eventually lead increases deaths. lot people susceptible believing want believe. depresses me. this? Sources links would greatly appreciated. Tell people vote! Slow testing down? Companies required provide reasonable alternative. Curbside pickup reasonable alternative. would case medical discrimination. Oh boy mr Ian üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ award students takes tests prevent spreading...by giving ticket priority attend massive gatherings perfect spreading hubs?

Am missing something? vaccines targeting spike protein, gives virus selective advantage reproduction. Highly unlikely mutates. means vaccines equivalent sniper headshot, opposed shotgun spray. here's real virologist BS thread newspaper editor that, misinformative resembles cult Data midnight last night. I‚Äôm you. get antsy restaurant meal, easily work home(assuming find clients), I‚Äôve revamped workouts amazing home gym now, like home, except missing family bit, adapted new normal. continue wear masks public virus actual control.  everyone wearing masks.

And see could‚Äôve stopped spike first place. surprised there‚Äôs spike? Masks work. entirely school's acceptance.

This precisely *why* cannot transfer one school another like countries. Almost every public school US overloaded, even good ones. Combine fact every public school US *required* accept everyone within district, schools space students they're required teach. rare occasions extra space, take transfers. unfortunate part parents' job get child new school school buses go district. means wealthy people work 7-9am 3-4pm really people option go different school. Cold weather leads compromised immune systems. Low levels vitamin D. Bullshit misinformation. Sensitivity necessary pick presymptomatics stop spreading virus.

Edit: guy pulled downplaying shit June deaths exploded florida loosened restrictions people even wearing face masks anymore corona gone even though people still dying don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll get type increase. Long term care facilities major problem going stay high alert much flu spring fall *drinks hand gun*  year-round surveillance place, coronaviruses cases detected December April/May, peaked January/February. 2.5% cases occurred June India exactly third world country friend. 24:00 ? Fall coming get Flu Covid time! That's like 2 1 sale ICU both! Infected people saving money! /s I've worked home choice covid two completely different IMO.

When chose WFH, also picked lived, space decompress (in case activities + people). whatever space basically leave it.

Personally, I've taken steps improve things extremely fortunate life able that, get upgrades, even more... feel co-workers sitting kitchen table kids running around trying ""study"" partner either also calls working dangerous world. Flu season Hey, remember salt comments 2 days ago record 28 days. 

Who's ready round 2? Wow that's pretty cool added actually dying attraction horror houses year gonna happen, nobody‚Äôs waiting year vaccine fully distributed.  else think keep getting million cases deaths hospitalizations keep dropping week week? That's okay I'll stay inside next 2 years. fuck? makes sense all. useless article. wear mask call day. people expect going Summer Fall negative impact going Spring Summer failed positive impact? I‚Äôm Florida closest testing went 5 mins hour away don‚Äôt believe testing sites accessible. Egregious. That‚Äôs big word. need start talking stupid idiots would continue ignore fully expect US end worse Sweden (due factors pointed out). hard(er) lockdowns donot mitigate all. US end Sweden's death rates anyway.

You need tell nature sure denialist ass knows epidemiology. /s

Yall really different creationists.

It remarkable much yall deniers common.

‚ÄúThere cult ignorance United States, always been. strain anti-intellectualism constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means 'my ignorance good knowledge.‚Äù introvert, brutal... AmA.... seriously, need conversation :D No, thank you. rapid tests? like Yeah that's gonna happen. US even arrest people delibratelycough people take mask. tried prosecute Europe would except us intervene especially military. going lot schools. one wants pay $$$ Zoom U. meh üôÑ Still riding first wave simultaneously denying it, anti-masking anti-vaxxing.

'Merica. Grasses get sore asses ""Anti-mask protesters Montreal carrying American flags &amp; chanting ""USA"" right now""

Wow...just, wow. ""No lockdown"" misleading. Public gatherings 50 still banned, highest proportion work-from-home Europe, non-EU visitors banned, stores must restrict number shoppers, restaurants advised crowd people standing line takeout, more. mass political rallies there! relying personal responsibility community, rather curfews. flu caused influenza virus, coronavirus. Selfishness  NYC definitely fascinating tell. Yes, people masking well public complying distancing great rates compared almost anywhere else there's believable path gatherings dates without masks stopped completely. Throw population density (it's like single people live alone $4k month) might get major surge near zero levels suggest *something* stellar behavior.

Im sure change bit schools mostly risk coming back people fairly isolated, thus new segment real risk. butt chug beer leather mask on? worse china! least option go school different neighbourhood. strict limitation attending school cities, within city, entirely school's acceptance. Wear mask goggles.. safety glasses dust gasket. 1 active case would still say we‚Äôre bad. 

Let‚Äôs keep going. impossible, is, let's expect impossible. Seems like huge reach ticket office. COVID test 8/15 health October? way cases? Partner goes UW Madison, confirm school's plan. Plus students go back middle january, point people got sick NYE parties likely longer infectious Really good thread it. repeatedly upheld courts. Public health gives governors lot latitude. decision outlier, overturned appeal.  


The funniest part Republicans turned, let‚Äôs recall two Ebola deaths Republicans losing shit wanting people quarantined, closing schools, etc... 24/7 fear fest. But, hey, midterms Obama President-

‚ÄúOn October 28, future president [Donald governors backing Ebola quarantine would lead 2020, [COVID-19 pandemic United tweets contrasted Trump's then-opposition mandatory tell something.¬†With flu, virus¬†that's changing time. SARS-COVID-2, seems pretty¬†constant,"" said.

&amp;#x200B;

for now.

&amp;#x200B;

**The coronavirus mutating ‚Äî matter?**

Different SARS-CoV-2 strains haven‚Äôt yet major impact course pandemic, might Jersey ticking back hit hard March. 103 fever, lost taste smell month, near positive people, tested negative antibodies. giving light hope. mean imply exact text 10th Amendment, though powers delegated United States Constitution, prohibited States, reserved States respectively, people.

That pretty explicit me. example Louisiana Purchase, ""purchase"" part Treaty thus fell part Constitution gives Executive powers negotiate treaties. Something Congress, specifically Senate, still *must approve* (and did). falls line exact reading 10th Amendment. power *was* delegated Constitution land purchase ***treaties*** permitted Constitution, Louisiana Purchase ***land treaty*** received consent Senate, seems evident Louisiana acquisition wholly constitutional. (emphasis mine) - right Commerce Clause clauses grant implied powers, powers granted Congress, Executive none involve health safety citizens. historically fallen States.

Aside provisions Insurrection Act, nothing gives President powers case pandemic health crisis unless State(s) ask help. ""Police Powers"" referred to, encompass environmental safety health people, always Constitutionally fallen States unless ask Federal Gov't help. case COVID-19 Wildfires Hurricanes last year's floods hear news ""Governor so-and-so X state requested federal aid"". automatically get it, ask it. California also 2.5 new deaths/1M, Sweden 0.2... So, seems certain CA catch Sweden 2-3 months.

congratulations arithmetic know neither Sweden's CA's death rate stable hundred consecutive days. 

so manage simple arithmetic irrelevant.

but note point currently rates thing wont omitted Arizona: along curve cases deaths California's

Nah, picked next highest states. threw Georgia particular there. lets look Arizona.

Arizona twice percapita deaths CA has, derpie.

Arizona 7 day average 15 dead day population 7.2 million 2.1 deaths per million day.

California 2.5 showed. .4 extra deaths per million relative Arizona. Meanwhile Arizona 731 deaths per mil california 366, math like before, right, California catch Arizona 912 days. math stupid, amuses math shows full appearances Texas new cases/deaths (per capita) also soon drop California'.

Here though assume Texas cases drop reason. currently though texas 110 deaths per day California 100. Note well California 40 million people texas's psychology 101. 

Human psychology source. easily say political science shows society make things mandatory avoid free rider problems, that's really source either.

IF source present it. question?

It amuses apparently think answering questions instead spreading garbage misinformation.

Ideologues gonna logue guess.  wonder could also relate behaviours infected individual family. Eg lots speaking, eating together close quarters, etc. clarify administered clinic, advise mother care absolutely necessary, know doctors trusted. case feel may be, take risk? ""what kind life this?"" - united states absolute dumpster fire, parents worst area country, people shit regulations time, clinics administer fucking petri dishes. we're die go fucking massive debt deal this. concerned one family doctors, even less EU. cases per 100,000 city million 20 times lower county million parents are. Ah ok better coming Fauci generally can't. School assignments based resident's address often little flexibility. Plus, even get child another public school school bus system generally accomodate child outside school district. dont think woods means think people wildly underestimated impact combining fair degree exposure (20% whatever it) plus significant distancing mask wearing, especially vulnerable populations communities. however long decent immunity lasts, there's less opportunity pick back higher risk-taking groups spread group group easily.

So places like SF really, really good get surge, really surprise way California getting came shock. nothing stop things opened bit. keep idiots state away, could work. I'd rather risk bout Covid concussion spinal injury. Probably: There's epidemiological reason second infection's timing e.g. someone household confirmed sick, medical provider area second wave. odds someone recovered relapse time later \*just\* exposed great.

Certainty: Genetic comparison. common first time even tested positive let alone sample kept examined, ironclad. lot Covid spread happens park bathrooms  flu virus sweetie regular times even modern vaccines take years development high safety standards prevent serious issues. record holder fastest vaccine mumps vaccine developed 60's (1963 1967) based prior knowledge. current ebola vaccine needed five years tests considered safe end 2019 ‚Äì seen really fast according modern standards. Indeed cringe! 

This wasn‚Äôt bad ‚Äúbeer riot‚Äù incident campus cops shooting someone another mark ISU. Probably talked publicly could lead unblinding. I'm sure there's robust discussions behind closed doors. least lead type 1 error, unblinding lead potentially exposure treatment group. Hopefully vaccine effectiveness enough allow unblinding. feeling online march. Sprint quarter (or late spring semester) may hybrid in-person online depending goes. Yet epidemic Brazil followed pattern Sweden, time delay. Go figure. looking COVID-19 demographics today 16-24 age range far away demographic highest number cases.

Judging normal age people attending college... I'd say correlation causation. $23,000

One worst-hit states country, yet we're #49 terms funding. always animal trials human testing. No, phones thinner electric cars now, so... is... amazing Yeah, stay fire full minute, make sure read label correctly. /s Poland also test family person quarantine infects family free go days infect others. :/ test symptomatic people too, trust numbers.

Not sure 4 days difference important risk anyway. :/ far know there‚Äôs effective treatment respiratory viruses vaccines making immune them. mean 3/4 population thinking either hoax exaggeration, expected awful. Reality check: would great method processing *degraded* filters. Here's problem solves - we've experimenting decontaminating filters long time. decontaminate filters strictly protect user - decontaminate mask sterile end spreading virus patients. Unfortunately process degrades material mechanically electrostatically - current methods damage masks beyond use 4-5 cycles. advancement process - restores charge lost decontamination process. means, long mask mechanically degraded much, could stretched bit longer.

For average joe, going plugging mask night anytime soon. Electret filters hold charge perfectly fine months time. old mask, fact likely better filtering new mask! filters become loaded, mechanical filtration properties begin dominate, making effective - harder breathe through. worry electrostatic degradation unless decontaminating masks. thing is, many decades ago all, barely mattered *which* cancer got, got affairs order either died somehow managed to, usually died quite rapidly. 

Recently, relative mine liver cancer pellets shot surrounding tissue treat it, put tube leg that's done, he's fine checks.

Science cancer *really* moved on, lot. There's still bastards like glioblastoma, cancer's good cancer, nowhere near fatal was. specifically testing people would like attend large sporting event person surrounded others.

I'd view risky behavior. Nice get extra surveillance them. People health issues elderly trump rallies screaming? Well whatever then. Generally speaking contagiousness inversely proportional severity. worse faster knocks ass shows detectable signs. 

I guess could super lethal virus that's also super slow, odds even astronomically small virus emerging that's *either* really contagious *or* really deadly. Covid done much damage mix both, even guess contagious side lethal side. 

Ebola never really spread anywhere resources within hours infected could detected fever, within days people dead staying home. anyone interested much Utah‚Äôs youth cares this, take look quick look attempted?

The wasted month February?

The promise would soon?

The fight using DPA?

The active undermining public health initiatives leadership, actions continue ti day?

Propagation conspiracies? Yeah. exactly referring dumb justified healthcare workers know believe this, also know cite FB information. could dress like subzero. Wow. wish healthcare like this. several medical issues (chronic) actually actively avoid going doctor simply even good insurance plan, still pay hundreds per visit. include medication lucky costs $50/month everything. thing gets (husband I) decided start new job heaven forbid work independently, healthcare lost would paid us insurance rates exhorbitantly expensive. remember insurance Obamacare thing $5000 deductible still paid like $500/mo. minimum wage, like almost whole months wage. scratched temporary, go doctor, parents helped. unlikely get COVID short interaction anyone symptomatic. Asymptomatic spreaders via long sustained contact - one breath it, sharing dinner will. cough symptomatic spreader probably enough hit directly face, unlikely they'll feel well enough hand candy.

So superspreaders unlikely long kids staying outside (even symptomatic spread unlikely outside, light breeze humans gale force wind virus). limit risk kids mask - Halloween good time wear mask anyways.

Honestly anyways, blame parents took kids trick treating. think risky unless wind dense crowd. Sigh. need believe COVID worse evidence suggests? Virology lab Wuhan: hold beer (or bat) Drug hell disease gimme gimmes They're ""*now* deadlier"".

They higher death rates per capita right start, current deaths rates actually much lower.

In fact, Italy already fallen behind Britain could behind US within week (as long care home cases nipped bud). No. Expecting people behave reasonably utopic. that. don‚Äôt know Swedes, Brazilians general aren‚Äôt respectful others, even health involved. People don‚Äôt like distance take care. city hit miss unfortunately. seems like people wear absolutely needed (like going stores) they‚Äôll immediately rip get outside‚Äîeven though they‚Äôre still walking around crowds people. 

However, family ‚Äúfriends‚Äù rural parts state constantly posting pictures online weddings, lake parties, restaurant gatherings, graduation parties, house parties, pretty much kind group gathering think of‚Äînot single mask sight, even people background. doesn‚Äôt help also see posts facebook regarding feel covid they‚Äôre taking seriously üòî Swedish herd-troll-army strong Reddit downvoting every little criticism Tegnell strategy. matter seem teamed anti-masks anti-lockdown fanatics countries want use Sweden example agenda.

But see one actually counter argued post arguments that.

It better discussion platforms quite many Swedes opinion I. spread rumor Antifa putting razorblades apples infecting candy w/ COVID...to safe need microwave candy least 5 seconds high. enjoyed much turned sheep LEAST DON‚ÄôT COVID! üëçüèª like r/futurology Llarem failing government wealthiest nation history. Shameful. Yet people weren‚Äôt given right information, things weren‚Äôt done behind scenes protect them. there‚Äôs nothing US constitution Tom Wolf violated. Sigh. feed steady diet misinformation? Read article Manaus. entire health system collapsed digging mass graves. Excess weekly deaths exceeded 4-5X historical rates points. may hit herd immunity, certainly want believe not, massive downward trends infection rates world explained preexisting immunity much else.
 
And masks, decreased mobility, WFH, etc. plenty plausible, substantiated conclusions. want believe fantasy one.  Think second. key study cited author take extended Twitter thread telling people listen people like you, maybe facts side. experience doctors, least around here, arrange another local doctor cover vacations such. Even though wife retired day two per week friend dance community, want's long weekend.

The money good pays private dance lessons, well keeping hands busy knowledge community situation. No. tradition. growing old sucks, means lot people get experience favorite holidays youth kids/grandkids excited were. fear change modern world traditions give something stable latch onto amidst changes.

still probably bad tradition replace update. candy pretty bad middle pandemic. people carve pumpkins, bake, meet outdoors another family committed wearing masks. didn‚Äôt lose control.

You can‚Äôt lose something never had. recent grad, I'm glad got put potential plans grad school. Every college kid know living like virus. see Instagram stories parties &amp; large gatherings. mention casually reckless things like eating together indoor restaurants studying library mask. shocking kids 2-6 years younger fucking stupid. Employers ask students conducted pandemic interview questions, reward intelligent ones safe. id appreciate accompanying history every antibody vaccine article posted internet relate news, ty Thanks elderly ladies go cruises! Gee? Really? Whoda coulda thunk would happen campuses reopened?  Data set ourworldindata. Country latitudes here: analysis. Dude since spare time home might well make vaccine dude. Lol really wish did! california posted every day, university entity posting new findings. information receive consistent opinion? Man, rapid DIY tests needed. would almost non-issue. Donnelly would tested meeting. Even others managed get exposed, could tested home prior next days' work isolate needed to. really wish would catch - need far tests, ones done home. feel like I‚Äôm living parallel universe. 

Staying home. gathering friends. Keeping kids home remote learning 

Meanwhile everyone social circle sent kids back school, Facebook feeds flooded going vacation, going social events.

Am insane? Getting bad fomo  staff faculty get furloughed. still building contract expenses pay. businesses surround campus supported shutter close. employees unemployment.

Sales tax revenue declines. Land value declines. exactly pretty picture. College online semester (and likely next) get pandemic control.. are. bad writing bad writing. may completely right people going lockdown another year. That's happening whether leaders want not. also worry, I'm expert awesome know waited months exercised... mostly resting heart rate ridiculously high weeks. Priti Patel told BBC two families four stopping chat way park ""absolutely said would report neighbours broke rules. opinions. Backed violence. Authoritarianism acceptable, form.

Thank you! wear 2 heard getting really good results bleach brihht light. Nah corona go away. Also comment make sense. several years gone vaccine (which take several years testing)? 
Anyway main point. Point is, virus go away.. incredibly hard kill viruses. It'll reduced people better prepared, sure. go away. piece disease gotten nearly enough press. nation people needing dialysis multiple times week decades substantial effect healthcare system. Well friends family directly work hospitals deemed feel pressure declare COVID cause death due hospital‚Äôs agendas. consistent throughout US, provided graphs would invalid due inability properly evaluate COVID deaths. brother suffered this. alive well now, serious complications huge clusters blood clots weeks.

His roomate COVID, never symptoms. Around one month later, house work moving furniture around. day left leg completely swollen, rushed ER. discovered huge cluster blood clots thigh crotch.

The thing genetic traits trombosis, one family it. happened sudden large scale, doctors immedialy assumed post-COVID.

He stuck bed month, medication, movement allow clots stick blood vessels. Sudden intense movement, even higher blood pressure cause clots get loose, could go lungs (or heard/brain depending blood vessel affected) usually instant death. Stroke, heart attack, etc.

Aftermath: blood clots stabilized, blood flow permanently reduced left leg. fixed surgically tho.

Edit: clarify - assumed COVID causes hyper-coagulation, meaning blood clots faster, injured blood vessels healing properly clots dissolve normally would. exercise, might injure yourself, damage blood vessels could get fatal leave permanent damage. actually know (it's hard) done emergencies, simply legal Germany.

I used manage wife's Ob/Gyn practice. extemely worrisome. I'll hold so. We‚Äôve got problems right wing politicians pursuing agenda public interest.

If country doesn‚Äôt wake fuck we‚Äôll problems guys whole bunch lose largest trading partner.

Maybe try NZ - seem things figured out. 3 countries couple months national lockdown, 2 especially strict. apparently missed part noted job keep safe. claim better trust Dutch experts (and ignore others might disagree Dutch), even base claims zero evidence.

There always people disagree. good argument say ""some country says follow them"".

Its Dutch experts either. says, quote, ""Non-medical, fabric masks used many people public areas, limited evidence effectiveness recommend widespread use among public control COVID-19.""

Lack evidence also evidence.

But fair enough. good healthy look things critically, disagree. Good evening. Honestly? becomes hard breathe through. Yes, filters lose electrostatic filtering abilities time, mechanical filtration typically increases filter becomes loaded. large amount dead people already dead. dying.

The first wave virus appears less Sweden. lucky wont second. reaction pandemic primarily blame here. bigger issue would people answer door wearing mask make effort stay 6 feet away. feels like superspreader event waiting happen.

hardly anyone comes anymore (they go malls etc, last year think two families came), guess year leave bowl outdoors. used tried kid would come take it, that's major worry always keep smaller amount bowl refill it. Right, Swedes blonde-haired ubermensch. Tell us Swedes different.

Or maybe, lost ability frame Swedish model failure, you‚Äôre looking excuses. soon till politics moves Ab8 straight patients? Yes cause Switzerland powerhouse compared entirety US /s Literally Texas California alone would top 10 economies countries. attempts try steer convos certain ways cause truth doesn‚Äôt suit beyond pathetic. *..what..* start fire, world's burning since world's turning. real lockdown Berlin either. 

Everybody expecting change winter comes people start going doors again. Doesn‚Äôt seem like understand that‚Äôs still incredibly good sign. much bringing football back  Lol long think lockdowns/partial lockdowns going last think 6 months ‚Äúthe buildup? mass gathering BLM, can't spreaders anyway.  That's science says. Noooooo! shingles 20, painful! dad, ready this...got shingles throat. lost much weight &amp; basically wanted end life. He‚Äôll never forget Thats pretty fucked up, expect anything else US system. (As i've heard plenty horror stories US healthcare system insurance american gf works it) human banana DNA much 50% similar.

So question is, eat banana make half cannibal? relying personal responsibility 

So fines break rules? mean, he‚Äôs wrong us beginning   Back June, started saying late 2021 everyone said ""no way"" ""quit pessimistic"". Yet are.  Jesus Christ, people still trapped ships?! hope gets resolved. find extremely disturbing inhumane **ME FIRST** Republicans understand correctly US superior countries.

Of course, greatest country ever - lol. Ah l weak immune ssystem, go back relatives house. take covid seriously. understand make compulsary person classes online classes fine. 
My anxiety level increases think go oct, India. California started spike right opened businesses. governor institute mask mandate middle June, likely major factor ending outbreak. BCG vaccine may provide level cross-immunity. There's study ongoing UK provide interesting results, others finished (albeit poor   69 Record breaking crowds Halloween likely......  Ya shouldn'ta sucked llama dick free. shows 151 deaths June 17 people age 26. I‚Äôd say headline date, misleading, flat-out factually inaccurate. sure evidence supports that. true old cloth cloth masks, even ones made home definitely help stem spread. Sharing Mayo Clinic: [COVID-19: much protection face masks masks  cloth mask intended trap droplets released wearer talks, coughs sneezes. Asking everyone wear cloth masks help reduce spread virus people COVID-19 realize it.  face coverings likely reduce spread COVID-19 virus widely used people public settings. countries required face masks, testing, isolation social distancing early pandemic successfully slowed spread virus.  surgical N95 masks may short supply reserved health care providers, cloth face coverings masks easy find make, washed reused.  made common materials, sheets made tightly woven cotton. Instructions easy find online. Cloth masks include multiple layers fabric. CDC website even includes directions no-sew masks made bandannas T-shirts. another words, non-medical mask offer least 20√∑60% protection, bit zero wearing mask.

That's works millions particles leave mouth everytime breath, speak cough. matter 8 million particles 2 million mask. still infect people same. without bringing FFP2/3 masks discussion, currently widely available, offer 95√∑99% protection.

Yes, said non-medical. Thanks paying think chose lying criminally stupid. Diesel chap selling shaorma, humble opinion, spectacularly failing issue face masks.

You allowed think that. name van Dissel btw, Diesel. 

Hard disagree failing part message Dutch government ""Wear face masks public transport, make sure ate useless type (non-CE) still fresh memory.

In first link send comment talks that. He, spokesperson national health agency, literally said reason done political reasons. 

They clear stance since beginning, apparently politicians wanted masks anyway. case annoyed dissapointed them. van Dissel Diesel whatever want call him. guy dirt bag whole life trying clean image Microsoft. trust second. He's cut cloth power hungry elites. Downvote away I'm kiss ass guy 100 billion dollars. I'm skeptical motives past actions 675,000 people died US alone 1918 flu pandemic. So, I'd say comparable. Comparing effects two viruses similar symptoms causing harm, especially one historically deadly one currently, helpful understanding effects virus we're currently dealing with. hope learn kinder responses one day die. Congratulations entering remission, even 2020, lol. year just.. crap. Also, shingles. Oh no! roommate college ended getting shingles (twice). fun. 

May mend soon stay safe can, despite idiots world. &lt;3 attention... Bruh didnt say anything spread. specifically said fewer cases states, double amount deaths. long guys magically disappeared type would call CPS see kid playing outdoors unsupervised. mean seeing videos enforce it.. im surprised? ones hitting others sticks slapping wearing mask properly get non mask wearer's face. Right say mutations occurred effect vaccines work. virus mutating slowly. Herd immunity actually good thing. want that, way vaccine. mother-in-law pissed last year didn‚Äôt spend every waking moment Christmas last year, she‚Äôs ‚Äúdone‚Äù lonely holidays, husband going two week cruise. December. middle pandemic. real pissed told could celebrate quarantine two weeks get back. ‚ÄúBut .... ... February.‚Äù Anyway, here's Wonderwall. I'll never understand politics warp view like this. guess media playing small piece property damage worst thing world ignoring largely peaceful protests full support twisted mind.

And take protests (and ones spoiled people getting fuckin haircut) sign entire virus bullshit bright. sign outdoor transmission big concern though something extreme alarmists like ignore. Samba music makes flee can‚Äôt blame coronavirus one. I'm pretty sure entire college championship year determined team gets fewest players infected. Looks like LSU already running probably random currently unranked team. feeling covid apart... spread along way. üò¢ think reliable way counting retrospect - compare number deaths given timeframe years before. even compare pneumonia related deaths count obvious surplus covid deaths. Also important factor deaths due overloaded health care system - patients conditions didn‚Äôt get proper care due covid could seen indirect deathcases. Hawhawhaw! Nothing fishy website all. Hahaha! Sadly trust family enough. They'd likely say they've isolated 10 days even though went friends 2 days ago. even leave candy out. called trick treat, treat regardless. Yea rarely get sick it‚Äôs days rest, hits hard it‚Äôs exhausting times I‚Äôve flu sent ER. knocks sugars spirals, seems go you‚Äôre sick it‚Äôs hard get back down. would rather take unnecessary risk, sick T1D takes every bit energy least week. Fuck mod. takes time investment things. Thousands variables need controlled. healthcare? least two factors see it: access quality employment, people disproportionately low status customer service roles, possible genetic factors (eg vitamin processing). Urbanisation simply living high case areas may also play role. Racism real problem worsening outcomes minorities, it‚Äôs confined healthcare, may least partly genetic. research looks like Llamas need human sperm, consumed orally, direct source... Name checks Great perspective, needed today. Thank   Sorry looking systematically cull part population set system spy world. Thank time board

Herman Cain entered chat so? That's...it? hardly national emergency like made be. clever people it, reactive. couldn‚Äôt predict pandemic could see full swing. 
I weak immune ssystem, go back relatives house. take covid seriously. understand make compulsary person classes online classes fine. 
My anxiety level increases think go oct. lockdown halt sepsis deaths? one other?


And 1) evidence lockdowns anything flatten curve, reduce total deaths, 2) US lockdown hasn‚Äôt 4 months. Right, scared answer question. Actually per CDC June 17, 151 deaths age 26. might want see MTHFR genetic mutation (more info /r/MTHFR.) get right B vitamins, really help keep track taking them. One thing do, - pill sorter two weeks worth vitamins, etc separated day. stand open five bottles every day. one handful go. fulfills suspicion nation Israel exists excuse people sleep llamas good amount useful data still extrapolated order magnitude margin error. said, knowing error level means certainties specifics usefully extrapolated it. Ah well. Testing supposed free. But, testing free. Things always they're supposed be. get free testing county may wait week (which could way long) go local lab pay $119 get now. Great return back normal now? disease either, lasting damage causing civilization. nothing good current situation. knows things improve? Yes, eventually conquer virus, damaged society time do? Get here, comment frickin‚Äô raw!! wouldn‚Äôt post worst enemy!!! too. would definitely trust tech mogul turned humanitarian purely unselfish reasons, pr stunt salvage image all. guy doctor infectious disease expert. faced anti trust litigation known backstabber business partners. would blindly put health hands trust judgement this. guy motivated greed able dominate competition means trust must changed. I'll listen doctors scientists. High prevalence poverty, HIV, TB. Pretty high obesity rate, alcohol/drug abuse common. Lots factors. Source: South African. recommend reporting sellers. E.g., 

Sheer masks promote pandemic death disease. Etsy grow pair take stand. Don‚Äôt like facebook. Don‚Äôt make shop elsewhere. Georgia. husband went doctor's office last week even wearing masks. WTF? Seven correct answer I'm sorry. get wrong, I'm downplaying virus think caution needed. said, people misrepresenting things try shame scare others irks me. 

Take news last week oxford vaccine stoppage, many people spreading bullshit means vaccine failed. unsafe etc. People like pointing routine common occurrence trials shouted doom gloomers.

I believe honest people, misrepresent things. Another classic people acting like COVID death sentence 30 year old data puts extremely low risk. argue unders 30s cautious spread risk groups thats fine. trying scare anxious individuals thinking die venture rankles me.

Similarly people ignoring negatives mitigation measures like lockdowns unbelievable. jole uts dumb teenagers, hope adult would realise thousands work huge negative impact lot things. Similarly downplaying ignoring mental health issues harsher measures. reeks dishonesty It‚Äôs preventative measure. treatment. No, flu kills despite vaccine, still relevant serious illness is.

121 deaths however many millions young people sad, it‚Äôs Covid important. simply roll dice, death recovery, entire population like this, we‚Äôd roll dice every time. We‚Äôll lose far delayed cancer treatment, example. long term side effects, impact older people, matter much more. question mutation affect virus. Right versions spreading roughly similar rates, could change vaccine effective certain strains. 

The people get infected, faster virus evolve. Herd immunity dumbass idea. keep telling people best case scenario election almost certainly still leads increase right wing terrorism. Pretty much noone wears masks Sweden, havent seen one weeks live. Thats impression get. encountered single person believes covid exist. includes interactions social media reddit. Herd true possible. Life long side effects corona, wants that? I‚Äôm T1D well pass large indoor wedding too, recently. friends understanding, know struggle seeing folks treating threat is. makes feel better, I‚Äôve read T1D well controlled sugars able comparably defend virus. virus gets significant foothold sends sugars haywire get bad, focus eating healthy staying fit good chance asymptomatic / mild case. trying optimistic :) Trump's grand plan supporters catch covid die? ‚Äúcancer‚Äù never ‚Äúcured‚Äù- treated?

Nice antibody though. technically entered remission June Im way normal every way still much going complications. morning diagnosed shingles immunocompromised  Man, gotta way? liked Oasis music solo careers... gonna make hate two continue twats. :(

At least states catches it, 100% instead brain dead believe someone else's fault. flu deadly young people (OPs claim) even vaccine COVID without vaccine seems like pretty telling relevant information 200,000 americans dont undie shit. much money spent report? nothing rules ""their"" justification, mater system have, take $1 pill, someone costs 56 $/hr, 15 minutes time tied pill, receive it, put storage, take storage, deliver nurse administer it. things total 15 minutes pill person attributing time average total cost $56/hr, pill going cost $1 buy, $14 get you, wrong call $15 pill. Socialized, single-payer, profit, system irrelevant, real cost pill hospital separate actual nurses costs administer it, system change unless pay people socialized health care (obviously that's case). 56 $/hr arbitrary choice get $15 total cost pill. However, reasonably decent benefits package, 30ish $/hr wage way line nurse/technician would cost (google says wages range 25 40 $/hr). old article March pandemic first hit Northeast information widely known. Nothing like nowadays. NJ pretty good requiring masks indoors everywhere. Good. Hopefully everyone willing trade vaccine without nonsense proven. what's contact tracing system looking like NYC?    quite possibly silliest thing read today vaccine. part doesn‚Äôt make sense European countries like France, Spain, UK seen higher cases deaths per capita Sweden seem experiencing resurgence cases. Great, get year two go pandemic. article: 
‚Äî N95 masks critical part personal protective equipment used front-line health care workers. masks achieve 95% efficiency filtering tiny 0.3-micron particles, maintaining reasonable breathability, thanks layer fine melt-blown polypropylene fibers incorporating electrical charges attract particles.

Mmmmmm gave idea? It‚Äôs positive sense single strand RNA virus, mutates nearly fast flu, haven‚Äôt seen spike protein change material way would alter approach vaccine. doesn‚Äôt mean isn‚Äôt totally viable possibility, fact scientists expect eventually need develop new vaccine new strain mutated current CoV2 successful vaccine likely required 3 times year... amd produced meaningfulvolume quitea years come.

Huh?

This medicine likely going approved while, since prophylactic provide immunity, may need taken 3 times year (so tens billions doses needed year), likely produced meaningful volume quite years come.

I mean, put oddly restrictive things current vaccines, still come ahead since provides immunity while, prophylactic.

Many vaccines showing super high antibodies, higher got virus. Yea, antibodies fade (as them, expected would worried didn't). seen rash infections 6+ months (1 two rash), definitely get least 6 months, likely much vaccine, we're producing hundreds millions doses second half/quarter year. Android Apple? I'm Samsung using official app. antibodies ain't cheap 

thats got  know would bill. Yeah fr, kids got pee 30 minutes drive won‚Äôt sit back down, still asking question school this? sounds like pretty good job compared most. feels like India insanely fucked situation.

It horrible. lot ‚Äúthose people‚Äù attending Trump Rallies, going restaurants, screaming let stores without need wear mask... Another factor could Africa lot recent experience dealing pandemics. need told twice wear mask. northern USA peaked April, southern USA peaked July due seasonality/different climates/latitude, case vital infections. That's really. never second wave.

Hospitalizations currently sharply down, 40-60% deaths see reported daily CDC back logged 2-4 months. **not** current deaths. yeah probably lol

been thinking couple's costume Halloween (just stay in, we've got friends lol) honestly might try saw lmao Enjoy  Negative. BCAAS, Zinc+Magnesium+B complex, Chondroiton+MSM+Glucosamine complex, occasional l-glutamine, fish oil.

I aim produce day varied local organics, best get micronutrients naturally. 

Although worth mentioning also add athletic greens daily smoothie FITAID, Vitamin D, definitely factor adding taking. I'm also frequently outdoors, probably need supplement D3 all. serious taking daily COVID initially came States assumption ""wouldn't overdo it."" Even Donald Trump knows ""just flu"" he's stupid rocks  Eh, get washable cloth mask haa spot insertable filters, find filter material high rating. Tool box brand blue shop towels rated high. hepa filters.  honestly, idea.   I'm you. family full steam ahead getting together constantly, including flying around country planning Thanksgiving. act like I'm paranoiac want go Thanksgiving already know regards safety - brought up, asking everyone would distanced different tables, wearing masks except eating, etc, dad basically laughed off. So, I'm staying home. Bullshit is. Wonderful. get per-existing condition get infected die republicans like ""OMG PER-EXISTING CONDITION 6%!!!"" sociopath power this. Israelis give government (for obvious reasons) extraordinary powers emergencies. ‚Äòno lantern = knock‚Äô rule? Donny? minimum BMI requirement join NYPD? obviously looking different information. live, cases currently UP. whole bunch. I've following news correctly, true country, assuming we're talking US.

That said, whole freaking point base predictions things think going happen. models used fall winter growth used summer.

People need stop burying heads sand pretending ""getting better"", cuz not. basing words stuff I've heard getting vaccine within next couple months. Fauci said back would minimum 12-18 months, I'm expert listening one. appreciate explanation process think economic political reasons China might want ""first"" mass-produce vaccine?  I'm happy people near state taking things seriously part still. soooo frustrating way. check many people died everyday worry kids country going come college spread around community. people jumping boat weigh outdoors close zero risk. I'd go gym, opening showers up. home workouts now.

Not sure many people expect back gym without clean after. LMFAO stopped gas station hour ago, one wearing mask. Ohio, mask mandate. 

People care ""freedumb"", stopping virus; yet, scream ""muh rights!"" required wear shoes attire places.  I‚Äôm sure, that‚Äôs wanted share see anyone could come ideas. know that‚Äôs schematic build mechanism it..

**The Cutter Incident: America's First Polio Vaccine Led Growing Vaccine April 1955** 200 000 children five Western mid-Western USA states received polio vaccine process inactivating live virus proved defective. Within days reports paralysis within month first mass vaccination programme polio abandoned. Subsequent investigations revealed vaccine, manufactured California-based family firm Cutter Laboratories, caused 40 000 cases polio, leaving 200 children varying degrees paralysis killing 10.

Please explain how... ***SIX MONTHS BIRTH.***... Bill Gates anything Polio incident.

&amp;#x200B;

we'll wait. also, sometimes convince doctors. chooses doctors work FDA (not rhetorical question, actually know)? decides evaluates safety efficacy drugs? doctors. Probably team high level doctors, know, would interesting find out. 

My father law says little bit paranoia healthy. tend agree. Plottwist: He's voted Manchester United fans cause Liverpool logo Idk even bother talking antibodies point t-cells b-cells play WAY bigger role immunity last long time. like forgot learned high school science class. mean could play role think people genuinely concerned current administration going meddle process, vaccine completely vetted going rushed score political win. Stay strong. read article hypothesized wearing masks helps reduce viral load exposed, turn reduces severity infection get it. people made decisions. Don‚Äôt let convince make (bad) decisions. Initially, ""emergency"" ensure healthcare system overwhelmed. Thankfully, never came close PA. Add [deaths remained low well three months term ""emergency"" carry meaning.
 
It reasonable insist rights infringed perpetually unilateral say-so executive branch. fear it. People ignorant dismissive something burned hand, kicked teeth in. Government cannot trusted open, honest, looking best interests humanity, current socioeconomic paradigm - occasional lip service grandiose grestures count.

The reality still many, many unknowns. SARS-COVID-2 still spreading, mutating. arms race human immune system viruses. play novel aspect virus post virial issues think irresponsible play severity, potential severity. Testing good thing, concerned giving potentially infected people priority attending mass gathering. MASKS: shocked uncle California mentioned pay tests Australia free incentive get test Melbourne pay $300 taking day work test Well, mutually exclusive. Zoonotic events cause really bad cold cold absolutely lead complications populations immunize. would carful mocking people, technically wrong say four common cold viruses came animals think right considering cold virus family already exposed handle immune response developed hundreds thousands years. Unfortunately, one seems know long take immune adjustment. Hopefully sooner decades. yes, also trump keeps talking fatality rate -- percentage people diagnosed die. test reveal results tests, fatality rate much lower. actual death rate change though... much like graphs see around July/August.

 frustrating data cleaned political agencies available. really know numbers believe seems like good idea prepare worst hope best. hypothesis people repressed emotions memories likely suffer long term effects. body speaks soul soul cannot find voice. There‚Äôs book called Body Says Dr. Gabor Mat√© unhealed psychological trauma manifest things like chronic pain syndromes, autoimmune disease, high blood pressure / heart disease, cancer, nerve disorders, etc overwhelming amount evidence supporting this. Chronic stress suppresses immune system making susceptible disease less able fight off.  Sounds like something state would do. Indiana know live? journal *Science* August, one group researchers surmised early action authorities may played role. ""Measures travel restrictions, curfews¬†and school closures implemented early compared continents, often African country detected case,"" wrote.  authors attributed readiness take early action experiences many African countries infectious diseases Lassa fever. rapid response likely led slower spread infection, said.

I think answer simple. leaders took virus seriously start took action keep disease reaching many places first place. easy manage disease it. 

If cases health care system can't get overwhelmed with.

Also treating Africa like country instead continent going help anybody. I'm sure places continent worse others really understand difference probably compared.  Novichok tea given opposition politicians. experienced slob, think sandwich bag thing BAD idea. Sure, virus may survive there, seems ideal environment mold bacteria grow. numbering cycling pretty smart. guess Tegnell understand serious disease prepare Sweden. Swedish company even sent 250000 face masks China early february. Covid came Sweden shortage face masks Tegnell realized needed hospitals. Therefor adviced using facemasks among general population care homes elderly home care. worried would face masks left hospitals.

When ECDC recommended face masks said virus airborne april Tegnell unhappy tried make ECDC change minds. 

This seen mail sent thing worth mention part mail censored Swedish health authorities someone got mail uncensored ECDC instead.

This revealed earlier today news media written it.

In april private nursing homes home care companies started buying face masks despite Tegnell telling to. 

One mothers nurse called phone early may told happy got face masks. 

Tegnell unusual character absolutely want admit wrongdoings change mind. adviced use face masks early pandemic simply stick work admit wrong.

But closed care homes visitors earlier april 1 recommended use face masks care homes home care would lot fewer deaths Sweden. Regenerons antibodies, effective might get EUA month. Provided actually work, think pretty sure work, least prophylaxis.

By time vaccine readily available places virus faded background sometime. 

It's effectively burned Sweden, Arizona, Florida, etc. Agree. Also reminder research self funded (not OWS funded), must feel confident expanding phase 3 spending money trial prove safety risk groups.

It's bad thing long they're remaining house get sick, they're providing basically young patient herd immunity incubator isolating older family. real dangerous part ones running back home get sick, problem. I‚Äôm trying warn everyone, like February March everyone thought flu would go away summer. I‚Äôve right everything far (because read doctors scientists say) maybe listen time around cut stupid smug attitude got us first place Oh shit Clinton downvoting you! taking girlfriend!

I'm really sure get around sample bias problem, btw.

EDIT: there's also small effect fact added people died virus. (correctly) paper seeks measure percent original population got it, percent current population it. current population (which include dead) would slightly smaller percentage that. That's nto big differece, though. you‚Äôre comparing measure education corruption? relation coronavirus? provide source data?

We told could beat staying home, people stayed home, didnt happen. 6 times infectious diseases US. track nearly 300,000 deaths year. average seasonal flu kills 37,100 per year Senator Mrs. John Blutarsky. never mentioned flu, also less deadly. think flu covid? 1600 others infected. Either fining deaths life worth much less $3k. think need look saying number active positives increased 525, number recovered increased 695 well 9 deaths. 704 people taken active positives list yet number active positives increased 525, true number new infections 525+704 need talk whole man specifically part man relevant topic hand - infectious disease. Pretty sure topic antitrust. don‚Äôt believe government. Ok. Obviously point discussing you. 7000 deaths per week average put 300k end year

Considering much done reduce spread, reason weekly deaths would fall Exactly. 

You put 99 people room one person it, go home see one else month, possible 100 people walk it. 50 20 whatever.

But let's say 20. 100 people go back room one person exact stuff, harder 80 get it. Maybe 5 do. fast forward another month put together again, one infected person. Maybe 2-3 get it. on, gets harder virus circulate people immune.

What's number? one knows course depends lots things, health genetics behavior, research indicating 70-80 people needing infected. ü¶†ü¶†ü¶†üéâüéâüéâüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üëéüåÆüëç fair US coronavirus death toll also likely lot 200k unfortunately even close closing chapter But, Coronavirus Positive's also undercounted lot is.

You hear lot school system terrible, seems like nobody cares fact youth stressed they're educated. Spanish Flu killed young, healthy adults regularly fatalities. Covid-19 kill young healthy adults, typically (although cause long(er) term damage them, certainly) use think follow science. smug bastard undercounting? I'd like spiteful make reference mishandling virus. However need focus fallen citizens take preventive measures protect possible next 200,000. wasn‚Äôt problem already solved?

I'll add LSU's football coach mentioned vast majority football team tested positive (some even sickened temporarily disabled play). much lower threshold would suppose would've stopped spreading 20 30% team infected.

That almost certainly overshoot, regardless number herd immunity Tears joy bourgeoisie natural immunity! scientist, think point anything else go on, use similar things starting point what's likely. case know things like influenza 60-70% herd immunity threshold.

Having said that, virus already surprised us several times, maybe another one.

The interesting take herd immunity idea even without full herd immunity, spread slow likely spread become infected. virus work harder, speak, keep spreading. Seemed plausible me, least. don‚Äôt cheat. Regulation fair protect legitimate public interest. cut-throat bastard crossed line quite times. 

There saying back day better Microsoft‚Äôs enemy Microsoft‚Äôs friend treated better. delusion US citizens US government would right things?

Me, there's way imagined would worse India Brazil's responses. yet are. subreddit celebrated 'kid' nottingham got ¬£10,000 fine house party? Oh I‚Äôm dumbass sorry. thought could recharge hair dryer, wasn‚Äôt problem already solved? mean, atleast US, never second wave. arent gonna shut states again. likely thing keep doing, vaccine comes out, done. Thank goodness Maine big population spread out. basically like South. rural orange faces signs everywhere. I've times past two months hardly white men wear masks anymore. home Depot Maine help woman I'm dating get stuff wilderness school, many people trying tough wear masks workers nothing it. might want read foundation around globe past decade regards virology outbreaks, keyboard commando. kept telling people much qualified, conservative candidates Supreme Court listen me. told vote would bite ass one day. listen either.

I still fully understand him, one others? Except conspiracy nonsense, refuse believe that... Yet. I'm concerned crap article CNN's main page.
This article puts vaccines general bad light. thinly veiled anti-vaxxer propaganda Kaiser Health News (lol).
Why US needs conclude research UK done already allowed study continue?
They sleeping whole covid strategy, toughen now? uh, how's sub gonna pin boomers time?  may want wipe corners eyes. There's little leakage there. papers using R0s give 60%-80% number basis.

If number wrong, papers also wrong. day two ago posted subreddit discussing immune response coronaviruses general tend allow reinfection may give us idea expect specific case SARS-CoV-2. truth data point. means people trying catch virus counting ""herd immunity' taking huge risk little evidence support strategy. time tell vaccine situation may change, right know enough. well thinking department ya bud? days ago.

The question many people asymptomatic. higher rate, likely multitudes cases there. get grocery store work without knowing it, never get tested, hang out, feel fine, would randomly go get tested? interested , explained spoke pediatrician.
She said - projecting nasty cold flu season bad strains corona rhino viruses expect make rounds , particularly kids 

B - explained immune system stuff daughter isolation age 8-13 months time normally would exposed various viruses (she started daycare 4 months) , back daycare , children previously exposed viruses shut down. , children get virus may mild symptoms - parents don‚Äôt keep home. pass virus child previous exposure , get sick . 
Neither view negative part lockdown think anything even remotely ‚Äúhoaxer‚Äù , first time heard something hoaxers say. Facebook wall. I‚Äôm doubting seen , I‚Äôm explaining haven‚Äôt. it‚Äôs still ravaging country. many unnecessary deaths. much suffering. Oh.



Good. 


Carry then. Don‚Äòt go. OP heavy implication Trump/the administration anything, individual states anything. show Trump lock downs ""other restrictions"" (and specifically contradict linked article half-arsed ""China travel ban"" came play 29 days first report infection U.S. 300,000 already entered country China limited foreign nationals, etc) delusional. 

You're grown mature.

My comments regarding Brazil based GLOBAL* right. Ah yes. suppose forgot concentration camps imprisoning Muslims 

The drastic brutal measures take quell dissent using coercive measures suppression, censorship, imprisonment ""re-education labor"" dissidents activists, creation vast domestic security apparatus.

The lack freedom press

The Chinese government often uses ""subversion state power"" ""protection state secrets"" clauses law system imprison criticize government.  

But true paragon virtue huh. Gee I‚Äôd love live country censored internet press , government can‚Äôt criticise I‚Äôll sent prison , concentration camps built house Muslims. Texas Florida declined death totals 8 weeks straight, long people said apocalypse

And deaths spiked three FACTS

Lies, US classifying anyone died Covid Covid death.

No roughly 400,000 attributable deaths.

Influenza IFR &lt;0.04%. cause 13.7% total deaths. really fucking clue talking gets worse. allowing doctors classify Covid based symptoms.

Because another disease causing viral pneumonia middle fucking use fake numbers make argument, I'm going take argument seriously.

At point we're well 250,000 deaths mean. quarter million Americans die sometime bad things kill lot people there's whole hell lot anyone it.

Except there's lot it. helpless. COVID unstoppable supernatural force. virus. know viruses work done prevent them. title suggests intentionally spread country doctors neither paid time free say deployment. forced labor? Sounds exciting Yup, literally copied qualification missing headline article- absolutely additional commentary.

If viewing snark (or viewing downplaying promoting base article) projecting something. Wholesome mind done 90m tests!

Really? seems low. 90m tests people tested?

I'm tested twice week tested twice two months started that. I've never symptoms live state majority people government believe bullshit. 

I'd think populated progressive states would similar programs place would drive testing numbers artificially multiple tests per person. guess not. 'Outright Criminal' Aka ‚Äúremain afraid long possible! aren‚Äôt done manipulating yet!‚Äù Put kinds Covid hazard warnings house - think Halloween decorations knock harder... plain stupid? company forcing work office. Good call commented thing somewhere else post downvotes. mean totally get skewing district towards bringing young kids back instead high schoolers, age really learn virtually well they're basically school send them. Plus, age whole bunch learning disabilities usually identified, means going years without set back even years missed first time (because it'll still take long realize disability need accommodation).  That‚Äôs surprising even said reached capacity would've found much cases otherwise. r/frugal  r/zerowaste  comments read people like ‚Äúwe gotta live lives dud, people die cheeseburgers, fake news.‚Äù that‚Äôs doomed Source? work mid-town, office opens moday nonvoluntary basis. really sucks. you‚Äôre saying immigrants attacking ambulances? mean? wonder many posters dead time next year, either COVID hand. Thank you! also wonder excess death numbers also *adjusted* downward... news would title following ending ""... figured make 10 3"".  above, - statement, finding, \*something\*.

Good news ""We assumed 14. figured make 14 10 without learn anything.""

A statement finding news. Maybe game-changing, still news, still good. That‚Äôs March!  Testing New Jersey $15 due copays. insurance 67. literally get easy test visit sweetie Maine every month

There places Maine testing $200


Wtf Sweden close border denmark lead party people traveling neighburing cities keeping things open. What's team people featured Netflix doc, now? saying joy name joy that's signing comment? That's pretty direct... ? pretending cannot read english mean... literally got covid test partner lives maine...then spent week lake house, every night stand. 

NJ many rapid test centers. accurate? Idk convenient travel.


Anyway, point being: us darn millennials find way sex, whether taking advantage asymptomatic testing sites convenience 14 day quarantines bump uglies together.

There's trend tinder: "" got covid test __ let's meet"" ""believe would know it.""

Why? 

Specially since Indian media already covered it. FACEPALM. goes credibility.




Now important question. Indian? tell anybody. ignorant situation fucking country. 

And instead informed spreading mis information true Indian media would report it.


WELL IT.And gov need care thanks people like jump defense based zero info.

Feel free ask questions, maybe put mind ease little Title says 10 days study says 20 days. Sick misleading headlines trick people spreading virus more. concept people contact people contact with. Like New Zealand one point got control could nationwide bubble keep telling us we're already doing, government nothing sit back watch refuse raise revenue exercise authority. vaccine big thing government lot work on, course Administration managed corrupt one good piece work public privatizing corporations firing good people managing safety approval. Nothing like levels cut back 80s. 

Hopefully this, everyone reconsider robust CDC funded critical infrastructure save hundreds thousands US lives. 

Because global warming remote-habitat loss, next novel pandemics sooner frequent quite possibly worse. ways accomplish without total idiot. I'm sure exact plan, we're probably going something neighbors little bubble. going door door neighborhood, though. really hate we've got huge rates people getting really sick we're moving goalposts thinking calm storm. We've battling waves constantly. We're still thick it. ""Phenomenal Cosmic Powers trapped itty bitty living epace"" tried tested mate. war distracts electorate like nothing else. 

Hell, even right now, country poised beat US's numbers, news anchors leading witch-hunt actress allegedly supplied weed late Sushant Singh Rajput. 

ITS INFURIATING. Thousands people infected daily nation cares twat drugs. continuing study countries?

I know exception rule. ironic People talk resilience like kind superhuman quality. inherent strength. anyone showing resilience somehow #weak. Truth resilience nurtured taught.

Now important time build resilience children. Kids going back school middle pandemic. They're probably worried. Often kids able articulate feel, yet worried are, anxious may come. pick snippets news conversations whole picture, compounding fear, without balancing voice.

In scary times it‚Äôs easy overlook children might thinking feeling. 10yr old daughter helped put together showed signed worry - free PDF booklet children get feelings head, paper.

This designed booklet ‚Äì please print double sided, flipped short edge, fold. 

This something children own, encouraging reflection evaluation feelings. schedule allows feel agency life, whilst thinking back day‚Äôs achievements builds sense self-worth. think highest ever Sweden around 1700 new confirmed cases one day (these days 200 per day). population Sweden 1.4 million Israel. Nearly 5000 cases ina day terrifying Israel.

I hope cases mostly younger people suddenly increased testing going get bad weeks.

A working vaccine come soon enough. Well according experience last year, fat kid gets all. bowl last year could bring 4 year old (at time) first trick treat.   time got back noticed fat kid keep coming back got fair share time. fun diabetes, tubby. US helped problem trying take world. real scare attendees contract COVID-19. is. never shut first place. 
 
Stupid people go 2 weeks paying price. Along case counts comparable u/scryb_kincaid explained above, several factors make different time last Feb/Mar/Apr:

Primarily getting infected time: largest cohort 20-49 yo. far likely asymptomatic mild case requiring hospitalization. ***Very*** die.

We protecting vulnerable much better.

We know better treat patients ICU, many survive now.

We think widespread mask usage impact sick patients get wearing masks. Due significantly lessened viral loads, don‚Äôt get half sick.

Hospitals getting overrun: people die happens.

And factors I‚Äôm remembering. Two days ago someone posted Lancet article explaining death rates time around much lower. Check out; excellent. might cases corona deaths correctly accounted. accounting deaths large enough scale skew numbers (let‚Äôs say factor 2) simply impossible India. 

India democracy somewhat independent media. hiding going on, believe would know it. get big bag orange peanut things leave out. one ever take reuse year year! amount excess deaths year far surpass year prior. Trusting FL TX like trusting Russia China.  friend. I've wearing mask provided school, mask, bought filters, face shield, gloves long sleeve shirt. face covering, masks shield. come eat. gloves get changed every 30 minutes. Since thing started. also take assessment every morning work. Next week's news: ""15 scientists fell death windows last night. deaths reported suicides"".  kids wearing masks already kind cop answer lol

He brings relevant points, response ‚Äúyes thinks so‚Äù backup theory, yet you‚Äôre still upvoted he‚Äôs downvoted. Someone's paying attention result many companies forcing people work (or get fired)

Work home. company pay money sitting ass nothing. bubble? Traffic countries mean they're travelling English speaking citizens US. fact US even make 10% world pop yet minimum almost half traffic site still means far primarily US site (and site's origin base operations location always dictate that) obviously discussion around US.

It's sub problem. going whole website sub specifically non-US discussion (basically non-US location subs). Yes are!!!!1 economy getting better, chocolate rations up!

Normally I‚Äôd chill Halloween watching movies home year it. :‚Äô( That‚Äôs pretty scary! hope you‚Äôre ok? British standoffish attitude helping far. 0 deaths Covid country last month. vaccine yet btw. isn‚Äôt even close true. We‚Äôre track anywhere near that. We‚Äôd literally multiply deaths ~6-7x per day, starting tomorrow, that.

Spreading bullshit information doesn‚Äôt help cause. probably directly related  know :-( requested day work back February. every year. sucks... holiday really celebrate. time retire global warming full swing.... always next year experience - might case tho get covid complications come it... Unlikely... sounds promising! Everyone, please see guy representative average Swede lol held liable court (fahrl√§ssige K√∂rperverletzung), consequences. realistic actually enforce quarantines. got that. Promise. many people won‚Äôt. Everything say qualified. None disinformation. Preexisting immunity may exist evidence suggest does--not least rapid drop infection rates places less abandoned pretense COVID precautions.

Here's article WaPo:

[In Brazilian Amazon, sharp drop coronavirus sparks questions collective want believe not, massive downward trends infection rates world explained preexisting immunity much else. know joking plan now, don‚Äôt really know going go enclosed spaces again, unless it‚Äôs necessity. going work grocery stores (once twice month). lot shopping cleaning products non refrigerated food done online.

What makes think couldn‚Äôt manipulated topics? So, basically, title flat lie.

Propagandists gonna propagandize. makes sure that? hardly tell. Lemme guess: hErD iMmUnItY?

Have read article? not, least read quoted excerpts article? I'll quote one below, excuse read wasted chance get better summer spring. wasted chance plan fall summer. We‚Äôre wasting time now. Next year isn‚Äôt far away.

You know means? get act together stop complacent every time there's little red sticker calendar, we'll see month month shtick. 

Skeptics like point ""concrete evidence"" lockdowns work, ""only delay inevitable"". right? Halfway. tantamount stopping antibiotics early. stop locking outbreak control, done much damage economy people's lives, without gain. 

Lockdowns, public health measures mask wearing, effective maintain long necessary. However, justify using them. safe. think wind last week blew COVID-19 virus state. Countries need start training people give people injections then, get military trained something. Jesus christ needs fuck miserable depressing bullshit Cause destroying us economy worst solution Covid possible. dense get point? clearly ignorant whole situation No. entirely. Especially threaten many vulnerable. 

And yes, young lax attitude Sweden, like countries, still respect social distancing **others**, themselves, see cases rise group, much other. think exactly seeing right now. 

And finally: yes. Time tell. early draw hard conclusions yet. matter lot redditors try do. Please tell it‚Äôs anal swear god TSLA ‚ÄúInformation contact tracing program shows common factors positive cases participation large gatherings, particularly among sororities, fraternities multistudent residences University Hill, along failure wear face coverings practice physical distancing,‚Äù DiStefano Jones wrote letter. ‚ÄúTo date, county health officials quarantined residents four sorority houses.‚Äù printers broken, operating system. thing functional printer.   Jesus name! choose say 6-9 months? get breakdown timeline points interest? mean it‚Äôll need phase 3 human trails cheer less paranoid bumping someone? sounds like good news! Really topic Covid US worrying shutting stuff almost cases yet US? Well 1000 deaths people crying shut things down, didn‚Äôt TB? I‚Äôm sorry Covid isn‚Äôt monster desperately want strange reason. People believe science conclusions pessimistic. hard lockdown people restrictions everyone else idea would never practically work. First all, basically everyone general population infected, way keep quarantine long. virus slip every isolated area via infected delivery workers, care home workers, grocery store staff, etc. Also, put hard law effectively discriminates people certain age, would get ridiculous public pushback would never get implemented time. People even want wear masks inside; imagine 40-year old Karens would react put law saying can't go 39-year olds fine.  Unless you‚Äôre Alabama course cancer cured.

Traditionally, surgery regarded total cure cancers. cut spread, cured.

Then developed highly successful treatments childhood leukemias, example. vast majority, indeed cured.

Now exciting new biological treatments hold promise cure. 

The concept 'cure' actually quite tricky. really need define mean quite carefully meaningful. would consider 10 years cancer-free cure. could relieve people life-altering diseases completely 10 years people would call cure senses word. I'm talking motor neurone disease, heart failure, MS on, example.

If someone gets cancer 10 years free, id cancer returning new disease? said exact two things! schedule virtual teacher. Hybrid traditional virtual end month, lesson plan next week.

Teachers hardcore. day 5 cases (which soon zero) Sadly tip iceberg comes unintended lockdown consequences. 

In UK example, cancer referrals dropped something like 80%. 160,000 people year get cancer diagnosis huge number untreated people life threatening conditions.

Edit:
It actually 60% looks it. cancer referrals among hardest hit, 16,753 April 2019 3,759 April 2020, fall 78 per cent. know won‚Äôt know true death count political situation stabilizes. does. That‚Äôs definition outbreak


In epidemiology, outbreak sudden increase occurrences disease particular time place. may affect small localized group impact upon thousands people across entire continent. wish actually went back decades... proved point.. 

Also add important factor also human beings lives situations. 20 thousand going available. also people lives limitations. K trust anecdotes friends CDC excess death stats? least Mitchell hell series ~~BLM~~ police force racist terrorist organization goal inciting violence

Here, fixed you. **broadly** available There‚Äôs trials left one. They‚Äôre homestretch. good message, think ignored people proven politicize everything. COVID Vaccine Breakthrough Voyager Leaving Solar System Oh, virtual learning, area kindergarten optional. 6 years olds go 1st, decide stop virtual, withdraw her, homeschool, pray next school year pandemic gone. exactly makes unlikely? Coronaviruses well known capability reinfect. comment sarcastic? mobility feels nonexistent.

Honestly, touch plain bizarre.

There's social mobility almost time recorded history. true people terrible job taking advantage myriad opportunities available improve education/employment/social status, hardly comparable obstacles stood peoples' way little 100 years ago. think work completely unreasonable suggest isolates somewhere else (I would make exception medical worker IE doctor). suppose makes unique husband/wife working office.  
If goes parents potentially risking passing onto parents, unless medical issues imagine greater risk. 
If turn virus chance hugely increased better riding you. 

These situations tricky boss, I'd asking Husband stay too. think lot employers huge pressure due reduced staff numbers avoid asking self isolate seen absolutely necessary, right surprising. irrational consider risking versus reward. Agreed, tell people story friend whose grandparents got sick died within 10 days first symptoms people like... ""but old?"" 


I shit not, telling friend actually nurse, instantly patronized account without information saying would probably died flu year anyway. Hello. I'm ny.. we've flattening curve since April... 

Is like know ok visit friends...

Ah see that's also article. smaller batch people classify highest risk age brackets one working parent make enough support household. means positivity rate even lower weeks prior surprising. true.

As doctor relish secret power keeping cure cancer patients well dad, aunt cousin.

Sure, bit hard die totally worth keep Big Bad Secret like promised would get med school.

Edit: shit, I've said much, life danger. Good bye Reddit, gotta flee... possible cagey commenting potential problems want fuel anti-vaxx brigade to? take much trivial statement warped global viral misinformation campaign... OP bot? posting much? American! hope not, still doubt end year possible. referencing Ed‚Äôs comment, change since wasn‚Äôt intention. experience US. Covid tests available local pharamcies (CVS etc.). $125 uninsured $0 insurances. Sometimes day (yes day typically clinics/hospitals require doctor's note type thing) always next day day after. might drive miles another CVS tho. Takes 10 minutes get day report lab report 2-3 days (IDK what's better whats offered).

This might true every area see true decently populated area here. Testing takes time. attend weddings, funerals, showers, etc... people life selfish still events can't understand would opt out, need friends / family like life. PEBKAC, defense check Windows Mellenium Edition -- clusterfuck wheels shortlived biggest nightmare seen. Guess we're never going get people vaccinated, then, chance anyone hyperbolic doomsayers staying locked two years. mean difficult 6-9 months?  Bar owner said interview even though food license can't even serve food discrimination them. amount stupid makes brain hurt. German state live 20 thousand doctors working public system office, population almost 18 million people.

Our situation considered ""good"", still take weeks get appointment. never said ‚Äúall‚Äù it. Damn spelling mistake Murica thing ever.

Can call Pandemucc funsies risk brother's friend infect brother probably less 5%, risk brother would infect probably 10%-20% assuming live together, look studies table 3 get infected, Covid lung damage generally recover quickly, study found severe cases showed good recovery 2 months follow mild infections (which people age generally get) likely better. better recovery timeline form SARS1. I'm sure extensive risk heart is, follow reports found cardiac inflammation mild, evidence yet worse myocarditis influenza (which happens 0% 10% time depending define myocarditis). become symptomatic, focus rest otherwise directed physician, mean time exercise good mental health one best things boost immune system decrease risk virus pose you. heterogenous models account preexisting immunity. 

If significant preexisting immunity, estimates HI threshold lowered. 

There fair bit evidence suggest least degree preexisting immunity exists. article May:

[T cells found COVID-19 patients ‚Äòbode well‚Äô long-term hard tell. It‚Äôs hard get fast tests. states aren‚Äôt reporting accurate data. data funneled Trump administration created hub. election looming. 

I think there‚Äôs effort going suppress data right now, rather provide accurate, clear information. 

I hard time believing numbers. Yup :) categorically confirm part England, people struggling get tests, get they're turned around anywhere near quick enough prevent problems. I've heard, cramped. sure I'm seeing bumps worthing noting Northeast. actually referring to? Well would us fix covid response then?

You seem comprehend second order effects Eh.. aside couple southern states majority population could lose limb still want see doctor... us virus hit states. States reacted curve flattened states.

Last checked, even florida flattening trend would seriously hope not... üòÇ Yeah, heck keeping first weekend would big.  would guess spread would happening weekends go party school (almost 20years ago).  outings weekends weekdays pretty swamped classes work. thread locked basically entire comment section breaks rules. youre right, DBAD greatly ignored free market-

And get rid football getting rid frequent testing players removing environment requires discipline full schedule. safer secure environment football without. unrelated, I'm sure Thank goodness! Hope trend continues - CA already enough deal fires whatnot outright egregious

Well, that's theme fhe last 4 years, sooooooo... still processing 40-70k tests per day. lines. wide open. demand testing down.

What‚Äôs ‚Äúshit‚Äù it? stuff coming Mayor LA straight scary. Oh know word ever heard little thing called autocorrect? pesky thing phones seem have. footage secretly recorded way uncover happened. think documentary film crew allowed film country? never said specifically, common sense here. Specifically, look context ruling. Judge say restrictions, general, Unconstitutional, Governor's specific restrictions Unconstitutional.

Cities, Counties, States put certain restrictions place limit gathering within safe measures. said, figured would start happening soon, whether restrictions complete removal Constitutional rights/liberties.

There's also difference ""prohibit"" ""restrict capacity"". 

Look, issue COVID-19 Restrictions pro-mask mandate. needs done done, law law. enforce selectively..... well, we've already seen happen horrible effect, I'd rather give reason ignore laws supposed protect us. Trump anticipates impending prison time, naw? Yes, india get oodles money return. Good business end. Yes, it‚Äôs pretty much policy came Barry Goldwater‚Äôs defeat. strategist came bad faith tactic Jude Wanniski, coined supply-side/trickledown economics well ‚Äútwo santas‚Äù theory.

What we‚Äôre seeing u/Jaaphoop's comment pretty clearly sarcastic also. dude's got sarcasm detection Drax Destroyer.  country currently holding 1 million Muslims concentration camps slaughtering them? That's he's saying probably know it.

There smoking allowed restaurants consensus says smoker allowed force illness others person's health important smoker's right bad habit.

COVID thing, many people dunces can't see connection. Anti-maskers others precautions basically smokers puffing smoke everyone around them's faces. hard understand?

Your right wear masks ends there's pandemic deadly illness wearing mask contributing illness. Children included trials eventually. one getting vaccine time soon. 27 years ago.. 
Every president afterwards two terms.

Yeah.... trust job historian. Yeah you‚Äôre getting response one lol. ""We could stop mining 10 minutes solve problem...""

*/r/wallstreetbets hated that* incredible disgusting degree Trump corrupted federal government institutions.  Vote Blue November, people, want US survive (hopefully) recover. genocide intentionally stoking flames misinformation health crisis knowing lead unnecessary deaths. Score! Yeah, I'm definitely lucky. think class moved online year two cheaper accommodate people fewer resources, universities that. 


I think incoming students good idea price school even applying, know getting into. picked program specifically based price quality. seeing kids excel naturally held back majority kids need mote time learn. move forward switching home schooling remote learning exposed ineffectiveness educational system US. see top 10% performers earning top 90% pay 15 years. makes Watergate coverup look like kids stuff. How's hospital capacity worst hit regions? Hopefully we're nowhere near full capacity situation? It‚Äôs myth, it‚Äôs literally Newsoms plan re-open least amount restrictions (there literally option place return without restrictions). 

Currently county able reopen ‚Äúcompletely‚Äù California need less 1 case per 100,000 7 day average 7 day lag positivity less 2% 7 day average 7 day lag.

Los Angeles county currently 8.4 cases per 100k positive rate 3.5%

For comparison, 2 states country would open California‚Äôs guidelines - Maine Vermont. truth you? Global Times? Weibo?

The Tea Party might sobering influence still around now. *rarely makes ill*

That's says. recent studies show Covid19 infections  *rarely makes \[children\] ill?* Many reasons.

Children public schools large vector spread pathogens. Vaccinating school children lot stop spread help protect vulnerable. 

Keeping children school causes real measurable harm development. 

Parents rely heavily public schools working many can‚Äôt work can‚Äôt afford child care.  park central Stockholm (S√∂dermalm), last week:  


It like months... since may... (This week got lot colder, sunbathing more) Alachua really area that's hot spot. +111% last 7 days cases. Pretty much everywhere else dropping. Miami-Dade fell cliff.   gonna get trickier many parts world enter 2nd wave, looks like China still managed keep virus resurging several months now. Good see understand kids seem less serious cases usually, however *rarely makes ill.* 

It strikes inaccurate reporting. ASU massive amount cases reported, numbers deceptive. reason N95s expensive federal government refuses basically back production companies melt blown fabric; scale production, refuse feds actually guarantee pay ramped production. Hmm could jerks  You‚Äôre downvoted didn‚Äôt include car dealerships first.

Which fine, people started cars break crashed couldn‚Äôt buy replacement. literally sending nurses state buy car could get work

It was... less ideal. Although nothing ideal everyone made mistakes spreading coronavirus along way. Everywhere, mean twice?

What funny CCP ""Americans CIA"" propaganda went mainland HK protests, chinese government saying protesters paid CIA, yet boarder completely ignored interrogated 20 year old hongkoners. would think would least pretend believe lies.  reports individual hospitals.

There studies ... middle pandemic. CDC requested information tracked it, possibly could settle argument. now, agree CDC subverted political leadership.  I'm sure public lately, also know HIT actually know many cases actually missed. can't make claim state near heard immunity. No.

It‚Äôs war. logical conclusion, imho. virus plummeting long mask order put place. think visiting.lol. Yeah, Climate Change deniers. One month colder one before: evidence Climate Change hoax. Fits well 2015 cherrypicking here. Correct... mass attempt create disorder weaken us. That‚Äôs genocide though genocide intentional killing people that‚Äôs really appears goal is. intent appears attacking us systems create civil unrest political aggression parties. happening feels like pandemic deaths something help push overall agenda lucky, like 25% online classes U. I'd much prefer taking classes online easily converted (usually classes lecture quizzes, homework, tests), I'm going pay extra it. Jesus, *rough* 24. Like whole lot city miles, went traverse Brazilian mountainside death road 100 miles hour suspension disintegrated careened 2,000 feet ground exploded.  think people right assemble right run business that‚Äôs asking confused. saying virus controlled now. saying reality went controlling virus something country try follow. happened Li Wenliang isolated. one example pattern keeping truth public, unless information helps party. Definitely seems likely. Even tests positive?  Shid.lol. think maybe spend minute two checking facts up. tell clue many people died Sweden compared us. know talking about.


We avoided deaths Sweden. economy equal better shape theirs. good. got policy compared dead people.  True, definitely know face-to-face interaction words screen...for instance, sir. But, I'm trying attack anything. person originally replying thing. generalizing everyone internet fat lazy. you‚Äôre saying people free reign contribute deaths hundreds thousands people (while sabotaging economy process) they‚Äôre dumb take pandemic seriously own?   hurricane big visible scary really trust someone reporting numbers can't count?

 ""On Saturday morning, India's caseload, per official state records, **was 46.6 million. multiplied ICMR's lower-range figure 80, 372.8 million**.""

I'm mathematician, but:

Seems like they're pretty bad small country. also reported r/coronavirusMichigan people collecting signatures using pretty shady practices, like lying petition sign petition something like clean water asking sign second petition false pretense thing, actually one. People gross. think naive believe government stand helpless disease ravages population people spreading gathering together. originalist approach could effectively collapse government pandemic could theoretically decimate population enough create inability administrate itself. way could convince people Madison Jefferson mind. Regardless meant it, others experimented rushed politicized vaccine approval process. Hopefully it‚Äôs safer taking presidents advice. remember much better testing April. peak see April likely 8-10x higher reality, one seeing likely 2-3x higher. free testing town every single week, college kids getting massively testing even without symptoms, April get test NJ unless pretty symptomatic hospital. Folks dying without even able get test. That's 1,700 probable deaths. Genocide intentional action destroy people -- exactly Putin trying United States. again, think SMU's online program $70k.

Youre stupid. Depends degree/program. Georgia Tech's online CS Master's degree around $10-15k.  passing laws like executive orders, state constitutions allow exist 60-90 days. None bothering pass actual state laws. orders open ended expiration date, awful precedent set. Wisconsin thing happen even bother anymore. months ago, they're fine. Clearly didn't. nothing. Sweden proves it. models SIR models. assume mostly uniform spread, do-nothing means nothing. Swedes ""do nothing,"" lot. That's I'm worried about. Back March much looking forward getting house enjoying life stuck inside miserable winter long. never got get enjoy life, temperatures dropping way soon. point feel essentially trapped inside *another* six months. true, think experts don‚Äôt think Florida clear. another set slaves people top happy them. east Asians?

You look mask adherence case fatality rates Europe US draw conclusion:

Here relevant graphs: let's look deaths per 100k population country (I'll put case fatality too, note numbers clear, since cases recorded, testing varied widely countries):

France: 45.99 deaths/100k; case fatality 8.0%

Spain: 63.41 deaths/100k; case fatality 5.5%

U.S.: 58.34 deaths/100k; case fatality 3.0%

Denmark: 10.83 deaths/100k; case fatality 3.3%

Sweden: 57.37 deaths/100k; case fatality 6.8%

UK: 62.69 deaths/100k; case fatality 11.7%

Source: masks critical part slowing spread reducing fatalities, would expect deaths per 100k lower countries better mask adoption earlier on. Instead, see Denmark, despite low adoption, far fewest deaths. Meanwhile, see Sweden par US, lower UK Spain, despite mask mandate all. possible 3 strict 3 week quarantine get groceries delivered wipe visit relative? know that‚Äôs asking lot would one thefew ways could see happening right now. first thought well read title part rather successful attempt control narrative.

Fact is, live China believe new local cases right now. pretty obvious would know you. would go another shithole country plenty countries choose actually invest people? sucks Governments organizations already invested billions development pre-orders vaccines (and yes, world end US...).

so yeah, magical point is: US states (cough, California) still trying implement fairly strong longdown... death rates still climbing ultimately end Sweden's somewhat higher level

I'll honest I'm gonna read posts.

I mean wrong. judgement call could wrong one. 

Personally I'm health care terrified front line people appropriate PPE right away. clinics whose supplier said ""you one box per week clinic"" need like five normal times. surgical masks. Basically suppliers taking new customers. needed N95 could covid swabs? find established order already. 

It's hard know would happen reasonable administration. Like behind closed doors like ""Barack, need masks every American. need guarantee contracts and/or take factories"" Barack like ""okay cool""

Anyway I'm sorry downvotes fauci generally force good, right could wrong move. was, certainly compounded trump et al saying ""let's wear masks"" rather say Biden must something wrong ""liking"" mask wearing.

Reddit sees nuance. trump =bad fauci=good man infallible. Maybe need hero hold onto.

Beginning wave could defined ""Over **n** infections per million people **d** days"". end wave could defined ""**n** amount infections per million people **d** days"". maybe definitions would something different.

Then could unambiguously say wave begun ended. Even computer program could tell us. Sorry making joke two parent posts. Could dentist. Everyone afraid say ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù word, ALMOST every time see younger person died it...I won‚Äôt say know  one cares believe facts not. Go back vape subreddits. Fucking degenerate.

I really care service business class - obviously nicer economy, hate flying economy meal, service, even $3 bottle wine serve.

Clearly would allow opening everything blindly since would neither gone would people previously infected would explain places like NYC seeing surge despite obvious reality people indoor gatherings, dates, whatever without masks time.

The power charter bank derives primarily commerce power. Though MCulloch v. Maryland especially concerned specific power authorizes it. oversimplifies little say Marshall listed handful powers necessary proper clause said ""I'm pretty sure SOMETHING authorizes it!""

The Constitution enumerates federal powers. also implies them. read words Constitution there. Codices true.  Much succinct mine lol I'm real introvert/hermit great me. depression comes financial uncertainties though. 40% new york covid, insane! sounds exactly had, including kids getting sicker adults, another reason think Covid.  would profitable so? even trying I'll admit bizarre comfort staying home often

Nothing bizarre enjoying commute. Yea, that‚Äôs point large RCT: increased clot risk deaths, would seen trial. thought Texas.

Most people public transit next hour more. People talking strangers. Even though lot people subways buses feral therefore wear masks, really direct contact them.

Indoor dining definitely risk, understand calculations involved think we're probably best position try out. Granted, going indoor restaurant least several weeks following opening - we'll see goes. I'll happy eat outside heat lamp coat foreseeable future.

Bah, people say whatever want, I'm current pissed apparently chosen vaccine trial.

I'll get vaccine first minute available, known enough scientists life trust work done. trust vaccine *Trump* came he's, uh, biologist. Luckily, he's one work.

Anything comes going passed safety protocols, period.

Fear FDA seems something I've seen wings politics, though associated granola types anti-vaccination movement became popular. One took extra couple years approved EU safety, sudden, whoosh, approved. new data could see. catch taking it, ever. offered it, dr surprised said no. look face said ""the clots?"" like, ""yeah, clots. Give one Phil Mickelson likes instead."" I've always fancied golfer, since I'm allergic it...

It cheap, though, compared everything else. Half price humira. I'm sure slowed number total events I'm also certain raised number indoor ones (and keep every week). almost month bad air, stands reason people twiddling thumbs family / partner / roommate / themselves. aren‚Äôt it‚Äôs hospitalizations take time True, would suprised form real immunity, maybe people likely spread it, would help overall Id imagine. 771 cases yesterday. Sound alarms!

They're 20th populous state 23rd cases... yah. They're fine. Obviously shutdown laws getting destroyed initial wave infections really major mpact outbreak.  wasn‚Äôt crazy stop working lot places. major cities hospitals filled around world morgues full Madrid caskets sitting ice rink. wasn‚Äôt something could ignore keep usual dead people already shipped around morgues could manage them. would bet good money (at least US) athletes get vaccines essential workers. people tried depressed? could probably google think he's miserable old man mentally declined enough anyone's useful idiot. Apparently someone wants destroy America found Trump useful, useful indeed   asking impossible, since best inadequate. Well, also keep mind it‚Äôs 25% maximum rated capacity, 25% pre-covid capacity. also 25% figure allowed 9/30; depending case count, might increase winter sets in.

There‚Äôs also question whether increasing indoor dining capacity would actually even help, given that, like (and me), 65% people NYC apparently don‚Äôt feel comfortable dining indoors: recent poll Siena College Research Institute found 58 percent New Yorkers, 65 percent city residents, said still comfortable dining indoors restaurant. 70 percent city state residents also said yet comfortable drink bar.

Without tourists office crowd - latter *voluntarily* returning - midtown dining would probably pretty dead anyways even legally allowed 100% capacity.

In early months pandemic, NYC‚Äôs Chinatown got hit really hard restrictions fear (slash racism) - point actively encouraged elected officials go support businesses there. happened American FAA refusal ground 737 Max. We're losing much credibility internationally. hit early unexpectedly, leading vulnerable people unknowingly expose themselves, boosting mortality. thing happened Northeast U.S. vulnerable know protect themselves, mortality gets boosted. mods habit deleting comments favor lockdown. Glad see one still up. man, read popular press news article. actually primary literature. know exactly said, makes one us.

can point seroprevalence study finds 20 percent anywhere NYC?

and course, cannot, wrong 20 percent. possibly even letting people stands regardless? you‚Äôre old health issues, lock door, turn porch light off, leave bowl candy outdoors Halloween. rarely ""patient zero"" cases country traced back to. 

We tried trace UK turned 1,000 separate carriers imported it.

But limited Trump. Although, sequence? spot-on. Worth noting sports exempt point seroprevalence study finds 20 percent anywhere NYC?

and course, cannot, wrong 20 percent. 2020 overarching message ""**STAY FUCK HOME**"" virus around long enough make claim. Many places known infections well spring. highly contagious virus introduced many communities spring multiplied exponentially summer. amount people infected spring summer, thinking might weight help us better understand recovery antibodies. see, that's mean.

I'm sorry upset facts.  actually insane. It‚Äôs disappointing shame ‚Äúyou could kill people‚Äù isn‚Äôt strong enough incentive.  No, clearly lol Literal Chinese propaganda r/sino poster.

and course, cannot, wrong 20 percent. agree. sub weird prevailing thought every single person corona time bomb, reason believe that. Even articles upvoted saying ‚Äúwell athletes heart issues we‚Äôre dead!‚Äù misleading, considering normal viruses thing overworked hearts.

Again, saying don‚Äôt careful, wish sub even headed. It‚Äôs like place won‚Äôt allow narrative that‚Äôs ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fucked‚Äù.  No, still rising. circling back around many countries, come back China multiple times now. dealt it, deal this.

However people wish malign China, competent government. outdoor event +100 people Sunday Sweden. one cared +50 ban. Lot old people. can't help it. purpose flattening curve spread rate infections, stop spike cases allow another one happen.

You making claims can't comprehend simple concept. Lol go back r/sino. China caught using bots twitter harass leader lockdown, American state govenors European never cared anyone Chinese. way much much looser height outbreak. Back February much strict this. know, could pick absolute extremes think measures keep safety (especially risk worried it), also crafting solutions address also important impacts measures. 

But making absolute sides would be... downright productive wants that. Hahahahaha right. bad though, that‚Äôs fact. simple comparison countries around world, like Canada *right next door*, example, indicates objectively poor covid response. keeping us locked away sun detrimental? covering faces outside? Vitamin-D toxicity rare. 

To knowledge toxicity reported studies daily doses 000 IU used several toxicity observed levels 25(OH)D serum level 200 ng/ml (500 nmol/L), toxicity observed studies reporting daily vitamin intake 30,000 IU.


To reduce risk COVID-19 blood levels around 40ng/ml suffice. check blood levels months make sure dont go high. India million tests day two weeks now. typical sub trust any
numbers coming developing world. people would rather leaders would constantly lie things refuse admit wrong

Uhm, Donald Trump wrong. Donald Trump lied. Period. There's big difference. Wrong means acting upon bad information, bad interpretation information. Donald Trump perfectly good information, best advice available, willingly ignored never truly intended solve problem.

Trump lies, people die. estimates proportion persons seroreactive SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies ranged 1.0% San Francisco Bay area (collected April 23-27) 6.9% persons New York City (collected March 23-April 1). estimated number infections ranged 6 24 times number reported cases; 7 sites (Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri, New York City metro area, Utah, western Washington State), estimated greater 10 times SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred number reported cases.

this actually found, derpie. note dates, testing capacity improved since then. regardless. seroprevalence surveys method used determine immunity population. 

so keep repeating this

However, morphine nothing else died thousands.

Here basically saying appears happened known case may may happened cases considered *fact* happened large scale. *not* fact. onus *me* prove viable long term immunity, *your* job.

I commenting immunity, inconsistent view facts.   would need average 2800 deaths day order reach half million. havent anywhere close number deaths since spring. Ok buddy. Whatever helps sleep night guess.

Remember 15 days flatten curve? lie.

It never supposed vaccine yet is. wonder is. nothing dude mean, 60 million people already it- including people care least- spread fast. That's kinda obvious.

What arguing statement? course not; nine days away. Yes, idea downvoted. know trust article, sounds like approached sensibly pool party, probably good idea. Mask wearing still pretty common shops must public transport, generally many bother now.

Edit. everyone wear masks, needed. completely agree. Depending looking new cases, 10-20 day lag date exposure. deaths lag 3-6 week lag.

He argues since know effective vaccine first months release, even one approved end year, still need take precautions data confirming efficiency available. Otherwise, see *genuine* second wave (as opposed merely second peak first wave, like saw summer), winter unknowns, need continue exceedingly careful even immunize. see convincing evidence vaccine large population-level effect, still need mask distance restrain ourselves. many us won‚Äôt. many believe vaccine saved them, throw back normal activities.  could lead big outbreaks, winter hits hardest.

Carroll also laments tragedy could avoided simply better compliance. I've said multiple times, say again: unfortunate could returned 100% normal, like Wuhan, done health experts told us wasted chance get better summer spring. wasted chance plan fall summer.

My point people subreddit acting like COVID super virus causes every complication ever. reality follows viruses regards severely effected, kind complications observed may turn much worse viral infections know yet, we?

So assume must worse, that's subreddit about, doom gloom. subreddit takes sketchy refracted studies single instances takes certainty. quite issue trials mental conditions. Trial participants detect adverse effects evidence they're receiving active drug, inert placebo, hence respond trials.

A number [trials tricyclic active placebo atropine (which similar adverse effects) found small observed benefit tricyclics, statistically significant.

Also take covid seriously anyone thinks don't. Everything behavior based. Going grocery store 30 minutes isn‚Äôt much risk wearing mask social distancing. wait! see friend stop chat close proximity 15 minutes? risk infection went up. 

A salon visit really playing odds. person working hair COVID chance infection pretty good. not, good. Masks help don‚Äôt eliminate risk mitigate it. Anecdotally, know woman became infected Salon visit. lady working wearing masks. likely spent significant amount time close proximity. Conversely, dad getting haircuts barbershop every couple weeks several months become infected. 

In summary, decide risk tolerance based best info available. that's I'll voting him. stocks up. So, another words, non-medical mask offer least 20√∑60% protection, bit zero wearing mask. 
This without bringing FFP2/3 masks discussion, currently widely available, offer 95√∑99% protection.

I think chose lying criminally stupid. Diesel chap selling shaorma, humble opinion, spectacularly failing issue face masks.

The message Dutch government ""Wear face masks public transport, make sure ate useless type (non-CE) still fresh memory. Can't cure stupid. know national literacy rates low despite many students college every year. gonna like breakthrough cancer treatments see reddit time misleading headlines.

Have recovered already? Yes, they‚Äôve come long way learning masks particular virus. 

That even pretty inadequate one may still blunt viral impact enough don‚Äôt get bad dose. 

Or even wearing one inefficient masks may lead immunity wear much about, eventually you‚Äôve exposed enough virus time build immunity without ever getting sick. still less per capita ‚Äò57 flu. far less per capita Spanish Flu. 

And 200k people die infectious diseases cause sepsis every year you‚Äôd like comparable death toll. Again, isn‚Äôt downplay Covid flu, pneumonia sepsis nasty illnesses. put Covid context. reason insults. Combine sunlight maybe! Someone alert administrators arrested criminal negligence. would quite weird flu virus

Not all, Flu causes myocarditis, it‚Äôs one common severe complications. Last flu season actually one worst recent seasons specific complication many people died ""DIRECTLY"" AIDS?

2. Grabs another independent quote says trusts companies making vaccines

3. Says ""some"" Americans putting trust companies FDA wrongfully says Gates position well, without quoting it.

The article jumbled mess completely false headline. Wait, weren‚Äôt mad places *not enough* testing (even though it‚Äôs mostly based people showing due symptoms exposure) last week? 

Now we‚Äôre mad place ton testing ‚Äúfor wrong reasons‚Äù?

66 everyone's masked salon enforcing distancing capacity restrictions, could make argument getting haircut probably even safer going store. 

I back salon yet, I've seen social media, they're keeping appointment times staggered never three clients inside (and huge space, that's well distanced) everyone masked times. Acknowledging nothing 100%, sounds pretty damn safe me. 

Given describing seems even tighter salon terms capacity, I'd say go it. that, makes vaccine effective spike protein stronger. going gym since June reopened almost daily. issues me. feel place town. haven‚Äôt much since March I‚Äôm taking loans don‚Äôt work focus school plan staying home til probably January. don‚Äôt wanna get sick really can‚Äôt afford too.

Also, read fucking math, you‚Äôd see it‚Äôs clearly point crazy would get starting like, yesterday, right. Nothing numbers absolute, clearly. Hey guys found bunch peer reviewed studies, CDC, masks useful? team get studies taken down/censored somehow? sure ever seen Halloween US

I have, slutty lol

Sexy COVID patient coming Halloween! suspect if, 6 months ago, confidence may vaccine late 2020/early 2021, Sweden would taken different path.  Awful move realize trick treating requires people actively involved right?

Yes, corona gonna long time, think easy say right country's strategy lead least amount suffering. Well seems like that‚Äôs government wants happen. Every single action federal government takes seems aimed undermining state responses, decreasing confidence experts, sowing confusion. seems, me, idea they‚Äôre going letting everyone get (the herd immunity model, don‚Äôt know works this).  California us though getting downvoted yet sort agree. cases low NY time get back bit. People casually getting together one cold. Next time get together everyone cold except one who's past it, one bad physically couldn't.  Justice‚Äôs priority focused school sports anything else.

Someone literally yelled me, ""FUCK MASK!"" walking. live Chicago. 


Humanity failed us. nihilism one true philosophy fail understand new wave progressive anti-vaxxers.

Ironically, they're putting politics science, criticizing along. 

They're afraid vaccine ready time November help Trump get elected, they're hoping it'll come election. (Even vaccine approved nothing Trump even countries approve too) Personally would whatever could put life risk. It‚Äôs one thing nurse proper protective equipment you‚Äôre reuse masks it‚Äôs insane. You‚Äôd sort martyr complex want continue working conditions. 

I understand people mortgages family obligations things like that. I‚Äôm trying make sound like would easy quit course isn‚Äôt. personally would everything possible continue working unsafe environment. Construct chute/slide kind thing, like long gutter, send candy chute upstairs window. Use tongs grabbing bag even touch them. Seems pretty sanitary. mean country less 5000 COVID deaths, despite 3x US population? 

Sorry, frankly give fuck ""horror"" results, especially since published SCMP 95% chance even true. news source publishes much BS frequently.

People misunderstanding post let clarify. China amazing job containing virus. Criticising China ""horror"" response pretty disingenuous, especially US lost 40x many lives US failed coherent method fighting it. Wow, getting ton downvotes. rising numbers positive cases popping Canada legitimate second wave might near horizon. lot towns starting look locking down. Mask wearing quite high. Even things haven‚Äôt returned normal (and haven‚Äôt 100 people die day since June3)... I‚Äôm certain US could returned normal (not really convinced information China legitimate complete). Certainly could hell lot better US guidance, better information, compliance. two countries lot common reactions pandemic extremely different. 

I understand exhausted restrictions difficult - currently. biggest fear many fears expressed article come pass. seems like semantics me. emergency become enduring crisis, decides that? figured begin, everyone understood life would considerably different undetermined amount time. time would make sacrifices collective public health. epidemic remain flexible circumstances could change moment.

From gather, circumstances changing better Pennsylvania, business getting closer going back usual. However, make mistake, maybe resurgence Pennsylvania. be. resurgence northeast. need look current situation Europe. 

When happens want state's authority enact new public health directives handicapped. That‚Äôs downvoted him, I‚Äôm man united it‚Äôs wider conspiracy ashamed tell me? America already lost near 510k lifes. Works cited boner activated.  candy bad enough itself. comically inept producing meaningful messaging. It‚Äôs amazing people understand this. Thanks comment. That's way like fuck! always great take action time.  Yeah I‚Äôm sure Brazilians glad fearless leader guide without lockdown. success.  I‚Äôve using algorithm calculate far accurate number deaths: 

f(x)=2N people completely asymptomatic still infectious. Reddit loves posts built-in excuse sit collective ass nothing. getting 525 Christians? I'm sure see link covid Christianity. 

Some faiths tend live together more, thereby potentially spreading widely. I'd thought would Islamic families Christian families though, given intergenerational co-living goes Muslim community, least UK. Like said parties. fact theres clubs, sports, events campus. Easy say chilling inside nothing easy sit home pizza grease covered phone day anyway like typical redditer  Right, that's fine, made sound like everyone goes gym needs access shower. Depends long takes safe vaccine distributed. scale 1 posting fuck winnie pooh reddit, mad you? lied month western governments downplayed 3 months already idea was. seem work coronavirus.

Love Brazil lot people get clots live much longer. pray COVID similar 6 years great outlook idea

Thanks info

To honest first year living alone fully like completely independent impression census every year US understand, want go home family's every night. like number one killer cops year covid... Oh wait. Somebody needs liberate America. EIL5 anyone?? think is. 2000, yes, (DOS-based), much.   Yeah danger goes away get bored it/s care? difference make? what's rural landmass outside ""city administrative""? city level city? Odds getting virus passing love. Run along stick head back sand. get get schooled others tuck away deep enough stop making stupid comments internet. almost think it‚Äôs lowish lethality biggest advantage (from point view virus). think much faster coordinated every government would react 30% death rate. 1%-2% death rate COVID right sweet spot deaths vs complacency COVID like polio terms disability. havent heard Post-COVID Syndrome? major upticks CFS related COVID. rock? 

It causes body's veins malfunction release clotting signals platelets. Easy body, especially heart arteries, get damaged hundreds tiny clots swimming amok. 30% critically ill suffer blood clots related COVID (this cited sources). question like sicknesses, sickness loves endothelium much damage similar viral sepsis, multi-organ widespread damage hyperinflammatory (this opinion). Flu strep particularly interested endothelium, influenza deadly COVID. Strep... well, strep's related two since relatively common bacteria. 

For clots related COVID:  loads coronas Totally fair valid! mean quarantine/they let work since he'd positive. works part time amusement park, think kind leave available him. needs day think lets know advance either give don't. care enough beer dead loser #200,000 US.

Your generosity compassion fellow man certainly puts Americans shame. post say people dying ""fun"" - wow.

What country from? need know brand enlightened compassion is. ""A record 454 new deaths""? eff shit? mean record LOW? What's funny, US CDC well everyone freaked bc Trump trying kill us all. They're already ahead US deaths per capita (although there's probably undercount countries, either way bad news) guess could super lethal virus that's also super slow

That would HIV, almost uniformly lethal decades, incubation period years. missing mutation allow airborne, even droplet, transmission, like COVID, world would died. still vaccine. 3k per death, still much better... though factor source claiming 200+ deaths... becomes go gym work break. Doubt work would fan taking 2 hour long lunches. yeah right. china lied virus killed millions. need upset. discrimination them.

I mean yes rules discriminate allowed isn‚Äôt lol. like bar owners protected class. guy full shit Worth noting still well shy body count countless post 9-11 wars conservatively least double that, likely much more. checks out

If expect last year half (which seems reasonable), assume life expectancy 75 years, yes. mean, know that, detected changes immune system, neurological, organ function following recovery. Incidentally, that's we're kids, far I'm aware. 

Unlike people ME-like cardiovascular symptoms persisting recovery, children made full recoveries.

It's nitpicking; relevant accuracy. law supposed quarantine 14 days upon arrival. Although clearly enforceable Governor Cuomo went Georgia self quarantine. said ""an essential worker"" (even though trip completely unnecessary. went give speech) should‚Äôve taken account colleges. everyone comfortable returning campus, send classes online first 2-3 weeks protect professors, otherwise put restrictions them. soon fall - testing possible.  law write headline word ‚Äúmay‚Äù ‚Äúcan‚Äù without indication likelihood It‚Äôs fucking disgusting, I‚Äôm disgusted responsible reckless release bioweapons manufactured body-property distributed mouth nose? *afraid* everything universe, exercise freedom stay home! push problems onto me. **/s** snow DAYS. snow semesters üíÄüíÄüíÄ probably expert them. ‚Äútrue cause‚Äù mean patient died stroke, sepsis, organ failure, clots, coronary, pneumonia, etc, Covid, Covid killed them. That‚Äôs ways Covid kills people. It‚Äôs double standard playing. important it‚Äôs convenient ALLEGEDLY!  kind confusing, news like mean ‚ÄúBut family members‚Äù spit mouth? surprised. Canada needed contract would even help us fight fires.

Making Covid-19 political issue stupid, stereotypical, dystopian American thing do.

The stupidity much scarier haunted house would open October.

I hope COVID-19 fades next year, wow. wow. meant support herd immunity. many things say, facepalms gesture. neither tbh Yes! Let's start mass-producing get Americans back work! ¬°!! Another 60k go catch number 1. Gao Fu, director Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention: question vaccinating public one balancing ""risks benefits,"" added, pointing factors like cost **potential side effects**. currently need mass vaccination stage -- though could change another serious outbreak takes place, Gao said. 

Above emphasis mine.

The two deciding factors:

You welcome support assertion  people Christmas shopping early self isolate 10 days meeting rest family done same, could probably normal-ish Christmas. course plan really viable family within driving distance live country significantly lower transmission rates US chance infection travel low already tried, Plus NGOs working it. population large. So, food distribution centers huge crowd gatherings. resulting higher transmission rates before, creating distributed food centers would require great management skills seen bureaucracy inefficient.

So currently going increase testing hope enough people get infected. example, 

4 months ago testing 10,000 daily.

2 months ago testing 100,000 daily.

Now testing 1.1 Million daily. TIL 4 tens/hundreds thousands rare Boo, surprise covid! true- def good news Oh they? live ACT bubble idea what‚Äôs going elsewhere. Life ‚Äúnormal‚Äù here, beyond grateful that. Regardless anything though, much better rest world. post locked. subreddit political discussions. turns serious problem, particularly ADE, eradication option. Unfortunately would require another lockdown, time proper border controls (Aus,NZ) aggressive TTI (SK, Vietnam). 6 months hell, would over. Yeah get it‚Äôs good know case emergency leave it‚Äôs unlikely. still agree though stepdad dressed like scarecrow sat front porch big bowl candy sign around neck said ""TAKE ONE"".

Accusing others behavior, pretty American Wait please explain...if kids wear mask what‚Äôs issue? Safely right? rate drops northern hemisphere warms death rates increase southern hemisphere winter following pattern seasonal coronavirus

Unfortunately, initial peak came exactly right time confound two variables. exponential growth phase took place temperatures changing equinox. may well element seasonality, virus may indifferent temperatures people's behavior change seasons making easier transmit, everything could explained prevalence adherence social distancing, can't say certainty.

Either way need treat utmost caution. That‚Äôs nuts. wouldn‚Äôt even go meet park, sit backyard somewhere? earth track logical understanding viruses - especially one - spread? Macau also counted separately. realise places called Special Administrative Regions? probably mean ""because got exposed die"". everyone sees wearing mask knows thus nothing worry about. Ah well, without mine, I'm tracked least streets quiet peaceful. See, it‚Äôs done. think countries caught off-guard enforce shutdowns. Restrictions ought swiftly implemented depending infection rate. hope America learn thing two.... im sad now... Oh give break that. US could never million years New Zealand. You‚Äôre comparing isolated island million people third-largest country earth. 

Anyway, sheltering home irrational. It‚Äôs definitely safest, it‚Äôs science requires. Please don‚Äôt pretend otherwise. Thats problem. people like arent going see people.

What say? post articles it, change anything reasoning, positively biased experience. read another comment work ideal home. Good you. Unfortunately jobs ideal home. work HR. others cannot go whenever like work. tons calls confidentiality issues (calls avoided 5 minutes live discussions). Coworking spaces? literally fired start discussing confidentiality things public space. coffee shop? Even worse. stuck home. like mine, lot jobs require confidentiality, make difficult perform remotely places like.
Look, need proper discussion future work, working home small part. single part much broader discussion. Jobs monolithic activities, everyone. Jobs different one other, different experiences competencies make every profile unique set characteristics.  prior actual exceptions people allowed quarantine home, caught red handed going they're suppose home quarantine. famous case Australian lady caught camera arguing guard.

So government said that's it, home quarantine. pple they‚Äôre told bug would gone already. what? Living life? Go hide moms basement don‚Äôt even test right antibody.

Seroversion studies aren‚Äôt reliable way tell prevalence based dynamic fans, bars, restaurants packed, concerts, etc start happening immediately.

Not activities banned enough police/military dispatched enforce ban.

Two female stowaways Myanmar detected postive today Yunan border city lockdown now. Good point. many places Europe US, surges occurring places spared spring.

Partly due behavioral changes - locals know bad comply, others think overblown - may also looser restrictions nationally enough effective degree immunity population already. Essentially new cases people coming abroad, everyone coming forced quarantine 14 days. mystery case occur due community spread, Chinese government largely confident shut whatever city happened in, literally test entire city. Anyone tests positive quarantines least two weeks, apps monitoring everyone's movement. Unless something unexpected happens, pandemic essentially China. No, Facebook got elected first place. Sadly, personal beliefs still override medical scientific training, especially political tribalism going around days. 60 cases day still lock down? Holy shit, that‚Äôs rough. government needs learn operate sort economy work COVID buy implementing mandatory masks, social distancing, amount people stores, early closing hours bars, etc.

Wearing handkerchief bandana might dick move, you. definition chosen yours? There's something still understand COVID-19 reported.

E.G.

Italy today reported 1229 cases, which: 525 new infections, 695 new recoveries 9 deaths, 525+695+9 = 1229.

Then every media outlet report 1.229 cases titles? even report ""1229 new infections"" happens daily basis, report cases report cases new infections, but, looking numbers, 525 new infections 80.517 tests 24h period, population 60 million people, sound bad.

So, pure sensationalism plain ignorance?

Should we, general public, focus datas regarding new infections, new hospitalizations, new ICU admissions and, course, deaths, rather sheer number cases? Yep agree that. get tested NYC certain neighborhoods 50+% well. Even heterogenous spread model that's used advance happy talk puts lower HIT 43%. 20%. seems slow people still staying away eachother voluntarily, born mobility data.

Furthermore, US healthcare cannot get prices care hospitals area choose best price. tell price beforehand, many cases seem totally incapable even runaway system. Strike 2.

They tell difference strains analyzing genome virus lab. However, much labor- time-intensive PCR tests, clinical importance scale time, differences symptoms mortality speculative most. testing mostly used check reinfections research purposes, ""strain maps"" anything exists (as know purpose them). worry strains stage. Mix multiple samples one test, shown positive, individual test. greatly reduce total number tests needed, although works well people infected. Yep Source: Yonhap News Agency (South Korean state news agency) lasted months. still going parts world. 

Oh nice could sit window meanwhile, let grateful... anyone know what‚Äôs technology behind this? I‚Äôve seen biosensors announced development hoping updates them, dead silence far.
This one looked particularly interesting me, idk it‚Äôs technology Canadian funny accuse poster using enough numbers dissuade scrutiny laymen, say thing you. read key point paper cited clinical specificity PCR test 99.99% even 99.9% like saying, like 98-99%? Seems know difference analytical clinical test performance.

From paper:

""In studies, clinical performance ranges approaches 80% sensitivity 98-99% specificity using good comparator, clinical sensitivity different analytical sensitivity?""

Question: probably dumb question, I‚Äôm tired genuinely confused this. can‚Äôt tell I‚Äôm allergy symptoms symptoms coronavirus. Based research I‚Äôve done, I‚Äôm concluding I‚Äôm bad allergy symptoms, still question: take antihistamines symptoms go away/lessen, means definitely attribute allergies, correct? words, would antihistamines affect symptoms caused something allergies? know probably dumb question, I‚Äôm anxious haha use saliva / blood whatever 5 different people put one vial. Use one test vial. positive, test person individually. got Clinton'd getting doctorate virology? kept up. stating funding development charities somehow imparts knowledge funder? niece‚Äôs school going back full time in-person next week AZ!

Agreed part - hate remove levers pulled Governors actually get serious pandemic future. 

Each state different risks challenges I'm fine letting run best - WY much different situation NY example. lawsuits allege Governor mandates keeping pace COVID numbers unfairly hurting small business, data reporting absolute joke issues. Also, lot person nursing home, relative visiting makes difference drifting away reality forgetting dying staying alive weak. Dying covid seems worse option forgetting drifting away cases correlated hospitalization, like rest Europe. Spain many cases per day May minimal impact hospitals. ‚Äúcasedemic‚Äù.

Definitely plan, thanks info! US northeast (thankfully lol), prettt much lockdown whole thing haven‚Äôt gotten much. Going walk thru woods trail right house leads river. I‚Äôll mask sanitizer me, know likely need except maybe 1 tight turn. I‚Äôm excited go outside! hold festivities area that's warm enough everything outside, everyone okay sitting appropriately far apart (and wearing masks using lots sanitizer get close), see safe enough gather holidays. least safe going grocery store point. us Northeast Midwest SOL though suppose. spare blubber? lamp running low. Discredited means what? legal term discredited doctors still practice medicine? Last checked medical community disagrees they're still doctors legally practice. funny think doctors China answer government swayed them. I'll get downvoted sub full Chinese shills one downside: smells like sh*t mind risk help people. take issue family members home state wearing masks saying hoax... I'm literally traveling across country take care people.

Someone local died really healthy (really rural area) apparently everyone appropriately scared. Yea got college football totally worth /s. problem people can't. There's almost zero way social safety nets America - especially quit, work able pay bills eat, starve lose everything.

What hell choice there? wonder record number people depressed. ? never said ""most people"" get enough sun, even really touched comment.

My comment addressing OPs statement everyone, regardless medical history, environment, etc, taking vitamin supplement plus multivitamin (which typically vit well) -- let alone person also regularly gets 15 mins sun exposure day.

Medicine one size fits all, making blanket statements without knowing someone's medical history dangerous. Period. I'm gonna say yes, get tested can. tested slight headache (I got rapid result account job waiting teen's results; headache congestion). We're positive. nothing else, helps know bunkering x number days. good idea. daughter absolutely loves Easter gets look eggs candy surprises them. I've putting telling we're trick treating better plan.

This it, Chief. day getting downvotes saying people take vaccine made phase three trials, even one produced China Russia. pandemic going end privileged morons don‚Äôt wanna get poke duh awm. Remember worry razor blades embedded treats? Homer Sexual think data manipulated since CDC lost control data around July 15. Miraculously, that‚Äôs date cases started drop.

I'm sending daughter preschool right 100% would keep home MO right now. People seem care Anders Tegnell goes tell opening schools meant spread infection Sweden. far, see increased spread. However, important remember children young people infected. 

[Graph infected / 100k children since start school different age No, shows don‚Äôt need lockdowns...or masks...and possibly even mass vaccination. Please find doctor hasn‚Äôt discredited medical community saying coronavirus fake then. dystopian. Cobra kai! pretty explicit me.

Literally speaking, imposes limit whatsoever federal power. says within federal power within state power. example Louisiana Purchase, ""purchase"" part Treaty thus fell part Constitution gives Executive powers negotiate treaties. 

***

[Even Thomas Jefferson acknowledged Constitution explicitly authorize purchase Instead, Jefferson considered constitutional amendment way conclude deal France. ‚ÄúThe General Government powers Constitution gives it,‚Äù wrote John Dickinson 1803. ‚ÄúIt given power holding foreign territory, still less incorporating Union. amendment Constitution seems necessary However, Jefferson intention losing deal France. ‚ÄúIn meantime must ratify pay money, treated, thing beyond Constitution, rely nation sanction act done great good, without previous authority,‚Äù told Dickinson.

That website appears right-wing bias, worth. Favorable viewpoint. 

What really arguing constitutional treaty power *implies* power purchase land. certainly *explicitly* state power purchase land. 

To extent recognizing existence implied constitutional powers, correct. extent imagining treaty power *explicitly* authorizes purchase land, incorrect.


***

So see post *explicitly* acknowledge existence implied powers. appears understand existence implied powers contradicts said I'm saying system (and law) basically says ""the Federal Government cannot anything unless law explicitly gives right so,

What *implied* *explicit.* agree Constitution implies powers, disagree system says federal government cannot anything unless law *explicitly* gives right so. Oh really know thank whitesplaning me. literally open door, hard that? you‚Äôre scared virus, turn you‚Äôre outside lights off.

Just asking, mean 15 minute walk outside would effective Vitamin supplements everyone's recommending? It‚Äôs bunch selfish assholes America three year old running country. Thanks coming TED talk. Flat stating ""take X amount vitamin overdose on"" without doctor knowing person's medical history dangerous. know conditions someone could exacerbated taking much vitamin D.

Medical advice given based online medical articles.  surprising? People forced stay inside lot people live own. social media platforms connect people (like gaming instance), understand depressive feelings really kick notch.

Heck, I'm fairly introvert, 6 weeks home, really wanted get back people office. Even forced lockdown. seriously, people feel lonely / depressed, reach others.

This propaganda. science. Hahaha typical Reddit. get racist end someone didn‚Äôt agree üòÇ.

I don‚Äôt live India buddy. Stay ignorant. Africa‚Äôs Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize says new research estimates 12 million people - 20% country‚Äôs population - could already infected much higher official cumulative number detected Covid-19 cases 650,749.
The research based examining seroprevalence - amount antibodies present patient‚Äôs statement released Monday night, Dr Mkhize said decline cases raised questions level immunity might exist country.
He explained initial samples ‚Äúhave shown seroprevalence 29 national seroprevalence study member Ministerial Advisory Committee, Professor Shabir Madhi, says true number infections may even higher.
He estimates 35% 40% South Africans densely populated areas could already infected, pushing possible number infections high 20 million ""some people like insurance"" I'm sure Russia, China, United States scientists ""persuaded"" say vaccine effective safe even testing lacking. Please naive use brain. find doctors scientists say coronavirus fake. believed there's bunch title ahead name. well stemming COVID flow Maryland governor recently went reservation engaged full phase three without meeting necessary metrics. Now, numbers rising (of course) social distancing seems become thing past (predictable government fully re-opens, people let guards instantly). üéµGoodbye Norma Jean, you‚Äôve got goüé∂ Thank you!

Sleep exercise important. never high likelihood dying. wear seatbelt car. skip checklists airplane pilot.

The question much risk acceptable.

The problem people mix personal question unfounded assertion restrictions lifted, economy would return normal. That's simply false. Many people would continue social-distance regardless restrictions.

Huge numbers posts subreddit seem designed encourage people stop taking precautions, ostensibly idea people stopped avoiding personal risk *then* economy would return normal. Unlikely.

There simple way economy return *almost* normal: everyone would wear masks. see countries. Americans exceptional. Idk, online program I'm like half cost person normal times university. Heartbreaking. Sweden lot social distancing. high proportion single person households, high rates work-from-home, populous dense. Even government mentions things. people frequent contact other, virus spread. 

It's like Japan. They're social, base R low virus decline minimal changes behavior.

Calling Sweden control group weird. People obsess lockdowns, lockdowns stronger effect people would change behavior anyway?

Regardless, basic straightforward question distancing asked. Instead, get crackpot, unproven, unscientific theories ""herd immunity"" another right-wing religious mentality concept magical miracle packaged bullshit bow used explain away something understood. think people take vaccine proven safe well tested.

I also think issue. safe tested significant portion population takes reopen completely take get keep isolating, get sick, take it. choice.

I work retail deal anti mask people, friends too. One gun pulled anti mask idiot. 

I agree, people suggested couple months would better standing. Genuinely asking, actually brainwashed incapable critical thought outside whatever fear week media tells live in?  Well one collapsed sooo fair estimate: 40% hospitalizations.

For extended periods maybe lifelong, sequelae occur least 20% cases mild severe.

I link right now, neither people subreddit constantly demean sensible people banned it. GOP playing Jenga government since discovered best way make changes create new problems blame others for. want proof, look Diamond Princess cruise ship. It‚Äôs almost perfect representation Covid acts. 20% ship got virus, 18% people asymptomatic, 14 people died (4 80‚Äôs, 8 70‚Äôs 2 60‚Äôs).

The data virus constantly shown Diamond Princess Cruise ship looked lot closer making sweeping policy changes. Liquor stores closed they're run state, could make decision directly. like lots government functions suspended. Simulation Naming wrong corporations jesus give us heads really LOUD OBNOXIOUS voice bombard us next time? friend took told 50% accurate. friend least concerned enough check, negative.

The person know took one came back positive sick New Jersey January. Drugs + Florida. surprising. California take hospitalizations deaths account anymore. go case positivity rates. could zero hospitalizations zero deaths county may still restrictive lockdown. important. I‚Äôve remind wife comes says ‚Äúno new deaths‚Äù like it‚Äôs good thing. would good accurate depiction situation. 

I‚Äôm also hard time believing Arizona‚Äôs numbers completely accurate. high long. seems we‚Äôve reduced numbers record time. doesn‚Äôt add head.

And living AZ, people act like there‚Äôs virus. People don‚Äôt always wear masks. Multiple anti mask rally‚Äôs. Gym owners resisting lock opening states orders. There‚Äôs great deal resistance here. aware any.

Mind, major benefit (especially aspirin) mostly anticlotting (antithrombotic) activity. well characterized risks, NSAIDs often part standard care. 

For myself, I'm still taking aspirin part prophylactic regimen. I'll increase dose daily baby aspirin symptomatic Covid19. fools know joking right  That's true. People saying get covid vaccine might give kids autism. saying want rushed quickly, approved politically motivated FDA, without proper testing That‚Äôs true all. must bot account.  instantly got removed political.  ahh, that's cherry pick one year.

did also notice higher last year?


You skipped last years got one equal. That's dishonest you.

that's typically use 5 year averages, derpie, note higher every year higher average. Coca Cola neutralizes Coronavirus lab setting. Wearing masks avoiding church funerals probably would enough start. leadership refuses suggest sensible behavior. two extremes insanity. However, one hysterical extreme ended long ago. hysterical extreme ongoing. google ""hospital capacity,"" find many go capacity regular flu seasons, year year. healthcare infrastructure laughable.

edit: here's good one:  already major cutback reporting covid. 

But yes, would make sense less panic Biden wins, (I hope) he'll actually try get control. like one trying fight wildfires everyone pretending nothing's going on. fault media going alert mode get us pay attention. specific neighborhoods. NYC plateaued around 30% forgetting Mueller told us point blank sitting president cannot indicted even evidence criminal actions clear.  Answer: know.

We control populations. Sweden probably closest control predictions turned wildly say even though lockdown, social distancing group restrictions (50 max recommended) curve largely [ignored increased relaxed (and completely relaxed).

How country amongst least ended total mortality totally indistinguishable year, question find really interesting. comment makes absolutely sense. China implemented absolutely rigorous quarantining rapid testing Americans could even imagine. even cheerleader PRC government incredible coordination medical testing resources, education health dangers, plus enforced adoption social distancing mask wearing allowed China recover quickest nearly nation Earth. Added onto Mistreatment human beings. Amendment stating government, levels, cannot prohibit peaceful gatherings.

So fire code occupancy limits unconstitutional then? okay question something even ""best we've got"" Correct. injection bleach. light brought inside body butthole. CFR dropped long time ago. clearly nothing strategy right now. really though? result Trump manipulating CDC data? lives vacationing Greece happened. get tested every days. possible minimize contact family two negative tests. Use separate bathroom, sleep ina seoarate room. Could + family eat outside next days minimize use indoor shared facilites couple days get negative test result? think people thinking diversity like affirmative action immunity really important part evaluating side effects such.  know fake Chinese person would never share political opinion. Information mainstream media Sensationalism finest. actual quote is: person requires one dose vaccine, supply wouldn‚Äôt fully available approximately 2024.

Key word: think true fires West Coast- happening liberals certain people care even happy Texas California. Maybe Florida. northeast, maybe. midwest, probably. share us percentage kids actually getting that?  trip licencse. Risk drooling. Sounds like bullshit me. Gotcha Covid already collected 1k signatures. Wearing masks, 6 ft spacing, crowds, wash hands. like, try. take leaf PA, succeeded get state's lockdown measures [declared  Goddamn true. tried draw distinction full lockdown lesser restrictions helpful got downvoted hell. wrong buzzwords set lot people off.

But know? MD PhD. I'm sure shift manager Arby's wrote 2 paragraphs qualified. Zero nuance whatsoever. Everything fired boilerplate ""no wrong here's needed lockdown forever"" response anyone even thinks examining discerning eye. I'm actually think it. came back conference CT early March. International attendees. Within 3 days bed ridden week horrible sore throat cough. I'm asthma immunosuppressed assumed cold. conference lysol, hand sanitizer, etc. thing wear mask. 

Makes wonder though say typo blood type less severe symptoms well people active immune system begin with. Maybe got lucky cursed rheumatoid condition. Sweden currently first world per capita deaths. entire assumption don‚Äôt worry another lockdown, somehow anything right, objectively performed worse nation - despite refrain never lockdown - still massive restrictions. Beyond that, economy actually done *worse* surrounding countries despite locked down. 

Their rate deaths 10x neighbor Norway. That‚Äôs huge difference. 

Also predicated fact won‚Äôt another resurgence massive speculation. mean upset you. Coronavirus cases estimated 8 24 times confirmed. Good see sub finally turning little bit. followed peak time time batshit crazy was. It‚Äôs basically r////politics: coronavirus edition. Glad see people starting sense here, even among senseless places. quarantine everyone comes country 14 days multiple tests, robust tracing system basically connected everyone's phone assess risk person based travel, finally even places zero cases hundred days, almost everyone still wears masks. tie back another really prominent issue American culture, Science works. plan experiment shit works first time. learn failing successful experiments large number cases.

The thing Science love, look failed, re-design something try solve problem try again. afraid fail something, fear learning it.

And back problem alluded earlier, large swathes population real difficulty admitting made mistake. Everyone makes them, daily, people many cases refuse admit made mistake, even something simple argument.

This led lack discourse sides, inability listen see someone else's perspective always right infallible, aka Karen think, SEVERE anti-science movement seeing now, feeds Q-ANON conspiracy theory bullshit. 

It really, really sad time scientist doctor US right now. year bad event wise, erosion logic sort self-critical thinking scares far events year. US perspective obviously. Yeah, thats flu strain changes continuosly thats need short lived shots.

The problem SARS-COV-2 respiratory virus like many coronoviridae possibly generates short lived immunity. need shots immunity fades away virus mutates decisive parts like flu. contract COVID, chances setting chain infections leads someone's death incredibly incredibly high.

Give shit people, maybe. College students right participate spreading disease vulnerable populations, likely fine. Flu season bringing immune systems overloading hospitals. 

People stuck inside cold months spend much time enclosed spaces.  Lmao okay bud Cases deaths U.S. going several weeks. long state governments attempt big reopenings like June, trend continue next months. **Question:** 
Have solid research outcomes speak long survive surfaces? saw things saying day, multiple days, depends heat/sun exposure etc. point feel like pretty solid answers this- info? I'd also like add slums exist parts big cities. place overcrowding present. go rural areas, lots people today living large ancestral homes, enough home even extended families. 
That reason virus prevalent cities before. However lockdown ended, migrants made way back home villages across country, spread unfortunately. told everyone wears masks Well...it get better much CCP paying post Reddit? rate I'm gonna move sanitary country people considerate keep shit order. India's curve exponential increase/doubling rate lot lower unrestricted spread. said, could rough months soon. it? 2% right now. understand ***Covid-19 clinical tests*** would ***""primarily pertain coronavirus associated outbreak""***

Please elaborate. gone. burned through. Cuomo fucked allowed highest death count country. Equivalent forest fire burns out. one left infect.   RDA wrong due statistical role vitamin innate adaptive immunity critical. statistical error estimation recommended dietary allowance (RDA) vitamin recently discovered; correct analysis data used Institute Medicine, found 8895 IU/d needed 97.5% individuals achieve values ‚â•50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed 6201 IU/d needed achieve 75 nmol/L 9122 IU/d needed reach 100  warm weather shouldve lead stronger immune systems high levels vitamin D, yet still cases spring. Either cases increase colder warmer (which did) cant both. weather could absolutely jack shit number cases Im leaning towards this. ever case airborne contagious disease? Vitamin-D toxicity rare. 

To knowledge toxicity reported studies daily doses 000 IU used several toxicity observed levels 25(OH)D serum level 200 ng/ml (500 nmol/L), toxicity observed studies reporting daily vitamin intake 30,000 IU.


To reduce risk COVID-19 blood levels around 40ng/ml suffice. check blood levels months make sure dont go high. IHME model bonkers they've wrong several times now. One early version model 60k deaths nothing that. they've overshot miles. 300k deaths end year probably still high estimate. sucks... Halloween mine daughter's favorite holiday. bought costumes early February ready year. I'm taking year despite much love holiday may last year wants go trick treating (she's 14). I'm pretty depressed it. But, go year foolish. would concerned antibody levels reinfection vs others... ADE issue concerned here. serious implications vaccine development. really see behavior outright criminal. Incentives matter. Simple effective. Reopen schools can't afford keep online classes do,seems like better approach.Also responsibility government ensure children go hungry?It's good outlook NGOs Dona lot government ever will. Better anyone ICE camps paranoid schizophrenic running cdc. Please world shun us awhile  cases 4.9 million, deaths 80 dead will. heart damage neurotical symptoms multi organ inflammatory disease. Except India taking holistic approach all.We opening everything removing every single restriction.The problem people hear this,they assume Corona done even careless before.Even see people wearing masks people do. general thought two shots first up, second boosting immunity. Nothing said yearly injections thoughts probably needed.  work international school China. us teachers getting put hotel 14 days quarantine. It‚Äôs pretty freaking strict, end world. (You get food delivered.)

When get plane immediately get COVID test. US point?is late lockdown majority believe science,as soon doctor suggest something riot talking freedom. countries locked down. Actually literally anywhere still locked down? Also Canadian here, I‚Äôd equally terrified both. Border closure isn‚Äôt one country another. Keep out, Chinese, Indian, Americans, Brazilians, whole lot. don‚Äôt need anyone doesn‚Äôt essential reason coming, here.  Except people handling passing around candy coughing , breathing sniffling place. 25% capacity LSU year lends 1 person 3 seats between. 

But practice probably means people close friends family sitting right next (who going spend time regardless) several seats away next person outdoor environment. masks worn, seem riskier going restaurant supermarket days.

At least get see Another Hunger Games style competition vaccine - awesome watching states compete ventilators, PPE, tests remdesevir. comparing 1.5 billion, 13 million nothing Trick treating outdoors probably pretty damn safe especially wearing masks. Transmission dangers outside low.

Of course idiots still hold parties.

Now mall? Hell no. I‚Äôve read seems correlation Coronavirus areas significant air pollution. hope people West Coast extra careful. Even doctors complaining PPE feels like cheap plastic.I know masks though. University rampant covid 18 years old could mathematically safer staying home abusive parents. Get outta they'll squash back normal 3-4 weeks. Meanwhile US ... Corona virus coverage also lacking severely Indian media well.Instead focus tabloid type news stuff like ongoing SSR investigation. important remember numbers see snapshot past current date, too, matter proactive versus reactive response infection numbers. numbers low already, they're going rise people go back indoors weather school on. There's already plenty evidence show college locations areas opened things earlier. Good lot comment doing. don‚Äôt something nice say, stfu. idea vaccine generate robust immune response. hopeful immunity last least year. state work in,hospitals desperately trying diagnose discharge quickly possible(they trying raise recovery numbers.As result 7 year old kid died 2 days ago right got discharged(he got discharged next day got admitted).

You take flu shot year timing flu season epidemic curve gets flattened. Flu shot effectiveness lasts around 2 months best Fair enough, what's know? He's epidemiologist biologist like. He's computer science guy who's probably lost actual technical knowledge computing past 30 years. really gonna take advice CEO even deal viral infections line work training?

Do understand now?

Here's example article 1995, SARS-Cov-II existed:  [The Dakotas highest number new Covid cases

Good thing covid seem impact much. Don‚Äôt bother! Reddit loves meat far hate covid climate change. I've always tried hands going gas station. supposed cureall virus

Who said that? western countries way higher numbers Taiwan, singling Sweden? government fixed entire anti-masker problem easily!

They simply allowed people wear masks: feel discomfort.....

SUPER CLEVER (/**S**) know what's good anti-Vax movement?

That'd turn what's already disaster massacre.

Like said, agree that's end up, course (that's things go eventually) think accelerating willfully awful idea get way many deaths way. really think it‚Äôs possible produce 7 billion doses vaccine months?

I keep hearing deadly virus. college students dropping dead? engage strict quarantine. Let professors decide want teach person. Let shops cater students. Let students work. Let working class people work. Funny goal posts move ""it deadly"" taking people's temperatures useless vast majority people symptoms effect Covid19. US lose Superpower status when:

1. majority educated talented people globe stop applying immigration visas US start applying immigration visas elsewhere.
2. majority rich people globe stop moving money families US start moving money families elsewhere.

Until then, US remain *de facto* sole economic, cultural military superpower.

Name them, please. true, name another country whose leader fat Donald Trump. medieval times he'd made king based girth alone. Sorry.. 

I believe ""Miracles""... 

I believe Science.. 

And Science says we're fuqed.. Germany : really close borders. closed travellers reason. People worked neighboring country could still enter foreign country work. Also freight still crossing bordes trains trucks (including drivers), economy relies EU-wide delivery. never border closures Benelux nations all.

One federal state East closed borders non-residents. never case before, seemingly nobody took issue it. That's tangential point. we're going reach herd immunity anyway (very likely point many regions/cities already), may better get cold weather hits. It‚Äôs thin comfort KNOW you‚Äôve done everything keep loved ones neighbours safe. every person acting like idiot helps decrease spread. care concern needed *especially* others irresponsible assholes. 

It‚Äôs hard going reality world wide killer pandemic killing people fucking nightmare way. stupidity, arrogance denial others doesn‚Äôt make less true. Uncertainty cost alleviated opening phone searching ""how much covid-19 test (state/locality)"". That's like saying walk 15 miles work know much car dealership costs. I'd go beyond sloppy say intentionally misleading. Swedish data easily accessible proves claim utterly false. right, post ""exposure""
 
that means may exposed, necessarily test positive.

Hopefully settle ridiculous notion ‚Äòthey would died anyway‚Äô.

How even separate exactly whether one dies Covid (you die it) strictly diseases practice anyway?

Excess deaths probably figure look long lag. officials countries stated like US? No. mouthing ask observe social distancing. whole US, states handled badly due governors forcing COVID patients nursing homes: NY, NJ, PA, IL, MI

Edit: Hm, interesting 9 downvotes, called slimy POS response I'm wrong. US response actually collective states' responses. New York much worse Florida, state similar older population fraction deaths New York had. mean anyone realize high death rates New York New Jersey? highest world! Businesses certain types forced close across portions state, early voluntary shelter place order across state, true ""lockdown"" here. 

It's also important note many counties/cities CA (almost run Republicans) simply refused comply lockdown orders, great many individuals ignored well. Southern CA explosion cases people refused modify behaviors - large gatherings commonplace, people swarming shopping recreational areas, etc. SF better success state, substantial number citizens actually complied shelter place business closure orders. could, make non mask wearing misdemeanor, mandatory community service, service digging graves moving covid bodies hospitals. Ah gotcha, bad. Chy-nuh husband came home gas station wash hands, got attitude bc told to. said ""I covid big deal anymore."" can't believe I'm married idiot.  revelers cheering YouTube personalities Nelk Boys Monday night rental property 1209 Boardwalk Seaside Heights, New Jersey.

No science said BLM protests don‚Äôt get infected. said outside, moving wearing masks limits infection.

Indoor mass events without masks like church services, weddings, rallies don‚Äôt protections.

Outdoor mass gatherings people wearing masks, sharing food drink purposefully following social distancing like Sturgis Motorcycle Rally obviously infection spread.  basically, trusts corporate CEO's ultimate arbitrators whether medical advice safe not. /r/nice  proves you‚Äôre definitely lawyer. :-) Masks supposed cureall virus, people still getting it? keep making mask mandate longer longer people still getting it. Welcome club!

An unintended consequence developed intolerance BS people, apt call is, also gravitate towards positive people previously space for. bother? Bleach tide pods probably work faster. I'm sure paying attention, studies coming linking COVID disorders many different systems body. people reporting long-term illness/symptoms. good data pandemic around months. Even then, people aware things happening determine risk tolerance.

But go ahead disparage woman sick. That's cool. Bruh field **medicine,** can't rush it! even year, stop impatient. vaccines drugs took decades produce, already miracle we're phase 3 trials vaccine. free. pay mostly taxes. breaking rules place limit virus spread.

The loss taste smell somewhat characteristic needs 100% gone. people reporting symptom report stark. also lingers reporting missing able taste food, jarring effect. taste smell ""off"" something commonly happens viruses. even u say true, what's ur point? maybe larger outbreak beginning countries might drawn spread. end day without vaccine everyone going get anyway.

but said still really know anything virus, best try best hope works out. first early. Places like California never kind los life Italy, Spain, NY England seems like real possibility seeing spike state level 12x fewer infections per day. Im starting think far, far less deadly media us thinking far contagious like news. 

I don‚Äôt like US‚Äôs fucking pathetic response caused 200,000 people die didn‚Äôt could take part odd retelling story emperor clothes. Madrid barely hit number infections per capita NYC hit. that‚Äôs assuming testing consistent across countries. know, big ass assumption. 

Madrid get hit hard NYC first round. long fucking shot. they‚Äôre slowly approaching NYC numbers. We‚Äôll see happens hit cases per capita overall. get excited like Fauci even now. think mostly voice reason whole Coronavirus crisis. everyone sharpest tool shed compared Trump. could've much better sane WH administration.

To point whether Fauci right person make call - makes worry else he'd/CDC say. 

In fact, here's inverse example. Let's say hypothetically treating sick Covid people w/ med people reusing masks means 80/100 saved costing 5/100 lives med people get sick die? According you, Fauci/CDC *should* recommend reusing masks then, right?

And what's actually happened? CDC made cost-benefit call decided tell med people engage riskier behavior claiming ""safe.""

But one front line people, realizing Fauci/CDC knew reusing masks still created health risks, recommending anyway, I'd ticked off. Probably not. Need probably 60 70% that. already lifted restrictions, China's existing restrictions might still strict countries ever implemented. Maybe people countries can't imagine sacrificing much economy save lives. case, saving lives eventually also saves economy, ignoring lives focus economy destroys both. goalposts ""Well, 23, b-b-but!"" also still understand probability.*

Says person believes still unchecked infection country 1.4 billion people without sign happening outside, countries already knew first outbreak ""unknown pneumonia"" China January. understand probability?

I'm stating face currently available evidence, claim China near zero cases active infections (not counting asymptomatic) much higher Korea New Zealand lot this.*

Yes, nobody would claim relying *magic* either. South Korea deal ultra-right-wing Christian cult refuses obey lockdown measures, resulting small outbreak hundreds cases. New Zealand okay new cases single numbers last checked. China walk tiptoes around rowdy uncooperative religious organisations.

But widely discussed here, China's measures toughest world, even tougher South Korea New Zealand. Entire neighbourhoods locked single confirmed case, mass testing entire cities quickly arrest community spread exponential growth could happen.

PS: China reports asymptomatic cases separately symptomatic cases. That's case months. I'm sure SK NZ reports figures. I've lived Florida several hurricanes. Even ""mandatory"" evacuation order issued really time resources available enforce them. strongly advised leave. often buses resources available may car accommodations can't used excuse leaving. make blatantly clear though decide ignore order stay 911. risk lives first responders come get absolutely own. technically stay wish, one obligated help trouble hits. death rate COVID-19 goes 0.5% - 1.0% affluent countries 2% - 3% developing countries. Without oxygen support, lot people going die. Michigan here. daily reported cases pretty close initial April spike deaths hospitalizations still way flat. younger people mild asymptomatic. Youre extrapolating exponentially small numbers, so, estimates magnitudes off. analytical specificity sensitivity PCR tests close 100 percent. happens thought experiment numbers closer real ones.

99.9% - 20

99.99% - 2

The issue false negatives sample collection issues, false positives. U.S. 742,504 tests per day caught 29,853 per covidtracking.com. So, table looks like:

99.9% - 3700 false positives

99.99% - 742 false positives

Vs. close 30,000 positives. False positives issue.

Your numbers rely misdirection via extrapolation unrealistically low analytical sensitivity rate.  nonsense even basic scrutiny. misinformation gussied enough math dissuade scrutiny laymen. thinking back 7th grade bio... Nope Maybe hardcore lockdowns aren‚Äôt great all. argumentative; ill symptomatic.   ""they let meal could kill me.  Who's they? know.... They. They.... people looking health.""

""They"" make money eventual perpetual health problems due poor diet. one looking you. hospitalized patients, even one day important term cost capacity. /r/JagoffsBeingBros Interesting insights. Though system sounds... Really unfair. would probably send child wealthier neightbourhoods' schools even extremely far away something. Outside protests people wear masks super-spreader events. Inside church services wearing masks - sing - major super-spreader events. can't trust European governments, trust European governments? Less Italy Spain despite lockdowns.  Genuinely asking concrete evidence there‚Äôs nothing concerned almost 190,000 people dead? endless amount people going health problems this? care health? 

I asking question initial post people believe science we‚Äôre going give sincere answer, mindless dumb bullshit response. 

Absolutely one gives shit trolling promise one wants hear it. Please stop stupid (i know, it‚Äôs probably really hard you). Thanks. Obviously poster asking good faith thank writing case people actually good faith see. Wow, that‚Äôs cool. Mine let us get tested symptoms. Wtf thought canceled Obese people need head's up. far away worst underlying condition Covid. might even want wear mask result. tested negative flu

The rapid flu test 50% false negative rate. really tell flu, can't tell flu.

Which, course, means there's thousands people flu got tested negative think COVID. case almost certain -- known exposure makes really likely U getting me. would uk example rely vaccine's production india? like giving india money india jobs come threaten uk vaccine disagreements capable produce domestically, albeit slightly slower pace.

&amp;#x200B;

the Delhi government insisted number deaths remained 65. reality, 20 persons died COVID-19 Lok Nayak Hospital Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital together. lot shushant Singh coverage tho. stop vaccine! social services! let‚Äôs basically assume real number times 100 then.

thats USA India cannot get shit together everyone else can. fact selfish assholes prefer ""going outside enjoying life"" caring anyone social creatures can't live 'digitally' relationships Zoom.

you 6 months want live delusional extrovert life normally again, calling everyone ""introverts"" shaming them? Holy shit, people need get euthanized Actually terrible scary. means able identify less 25% death coved related. Many countries got much better identifying almost 100% covid related deaths. Huh? Ive read opposite studies. saying wrong hints unstable. answer no, watch Bleeding Edge. wonder many tourists go there. 

Combined age thing.

Combined immunity thing.

Combined social/political factors. It‚Äôs unstable society death morbidity reporting, medical different things highly unlikely first class. Basically wouldn‚Äôt know. 

When bushfires earlier year, one coming holiday, instead, went France, Italy, America, Spain... virtually zero cases areas. aren‚Äôt level restrictions rest state it‚Äôs either much there‚Äôs insufficient testing. 

I believe fires happened, initially spread infected tourists, numbers would different. bet every cent next pay it. said limited evidence small number studies found patients severe-to-critical symptoms immunocompromised may infectious 20 days more.

Is referring to? still implies 10 days good people, tell exceptional case. think virus eradicable massive lockdown. already endemic humans, animals too. see zero chances virus disappear.

IMHO best case realistic scenario would yearly shot virus mutates/attenuates becomes one many coronaviruses causing cold. herd immunity reinfections tell us permanent immunity vaccine anytime soon. Leave skittles mixed M&amp;Ms long we're trusting Fauci, we're already good start! Halloween party bubble?

Males 21-50 fair game though. restaurants definitely pointed continued hot spot we're increasing capacity gets colder, less outdoor dining happen. Restaurants can't sustain model winter unless booming takeout / curbside definitely contributing factor.

&amp;#x200B;

Claims Indian media would cover it.

I provide multiple Indian news source anecdotal news.

No wonder state virus fucked country. Stay ignorant friend. much complicated viruses made amino acids genetic material huge story course is. made amino acids. 

In theory could make kind organism, like fish plant. country several soldiers peacekeeping operation Congo tested positive returned. think large amount undetected spread, least Congo. makes sense thank placebo effect? ~~Nah Denmark put border controls 2015 2016 least Germany (first time life got stopped crossing internal EU border).~~

While agree testing borders would great, needs much resources, personnel point even money (those border guards lab assistants want get paid ovetime well, tests cost money). find sort middle way little much testing. oxygen super easy make? 

You need electricity water. byproduct, even get hydrogen drive green cars. comment punched gut...I'm sorry. can't imagine scenario one reasons get angry others thumbing noses virus safety guidelines. gave dose much needed perspective thank that. Hang there. Get Reddit real world days you‚Äôll much less worried it. Check vitamin levels? arent testing much stay outside often. COVID-19 seems 100x infectious indoors. know it‚Äôs ok see families again? make vaccine tied income. Poor people pay almost nothing rich pay couple million per dose.  presidential obfuscation. problem is, positivity rate US high. pooled mass testing save time testing kits. easy narrow positivity rate less 1%, 10% even 20% people testing positive, becomes uneconomical narrow down. anyone old health issues locked institution elderly aka 'retirement home.'

Americans havent cared old people almost 30 years  could true smaller proportion infected going ICU before. visible issue improved treatments better experience virus. Definitely teetering myself. wife parents definitely parents retired wife luck finding non-high risk work they've idling (have work).

I least understand following rules tired stage that's going next real problem think. ones cared blatant ones trying exhausted either less vigilant start more. That's great recipe Fall / Winter holidays places move activities indoors.

Stress, burnout, exhaustion far less fun things battle top pandemic. know fact cases reported. wife's coworker's family got twice (both times feeling symptoms getting tested positive, think chance false positive low) yet seen mentioned article.

They contacted CDC, State County health boards apparently cluster fuck ""you taking person, actually contact people, oh that's really interesting we'll get back you"".

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* tried nothing, options 3 per 30000 wanted something similar side effects would harder people tell vaccine Nah really üò± justified insurance companies fight it?  dont understand either.

I mean, parent probably _like_ fact trick treat canceled, would _understand why_.

My thought is, anything postponed canceled, threat public health. wish folks thought way. places? I'll ding bad reviews. get severe Covid, without extremely unlucky, likely old, obsese chronic conditions, meet lots people indoors (with air condition), public transport, probably live densely populated area.

If compare factors: Half arficans 20 years old. live old (80+) compared many developed countries. People spend time outside ""well ventilated"" spaces (compared cold climates like Europe hot rich places like southern US). Urbanization way, way lower (around 40%) Europe US (around 80%) \[1\]

\[1\] I'm wondering is: pandemic milder groups age, health status Africa, fewer severe cases numerous obvious reasons? ""Don't make kids wear masks Halloween!"" Looking restrictions, sure party idiots go get drunk Malm√∏ party night. lockdown fitness peopl going Maln√∏ train.

Through zero coordination border stuff good. buy kids 1-2 bags sweets. Let nice afternoon yard watch movie them. know, important trick treating... want sell vaccine anywhere Europe to. Let culling begin.... ignore point scale ignored deaths give anecdotal news sites. Dude understand concept factor? saying deaths factor significance make data meaningless. 

And cant argue someone shouting abusing reason. nice day! Also talk doctor taking much. everyone same. one gets vote bet it‚Äôll designed like Dhalek last thing ‚Äòthe infected‚Äô hear ‚ÄòEXTERMINATE.‚Äô 

So.... zombies coming I‚Äôm sick confined. 

I wonder there‚Äôs thing hot zombies? Idk, I‚Äôll ask Jeffrey Dahmer. Maybe. Probably not.

Omg. Imagine zombies! completely allegorical. Idk.

There‚Äôs reason bait mice rats, there‚Äôs reason wash hands go toilet, reason cover cough thing Rona, comes this? Atleast people won‚Äôt think I‚Äôm weird wanting physically distant. 

That makes feel warm. 

:) Anyone knows death rate? exactly plan. Going leave individual paper bags candy porch Yeah dont many cases without deaths. However, trust Germany's count lower west so. 35 excess minutes life,[ check statistics walk we‚Äôre going need large scale vaccination program. better not. can‚Äôt get majority first dose vaccine distributed next summer think tempers really start flare people start injecting drugs besides vaccines regularly. mean that‚Äôs plan can‚Äôt get shit together next year, already stocked drugs world ain‚Äôt gonna bring way down.  I? last checked, cases CAUSE deaths, might say they're related. cases increase, deaths increase. ESPECIALLY cases increased beyond medical system reasonably handle. 

Just like spring. 

Yes, we've gotten better treating it, death case ratio gone down, still physical limitations healthcare system going hit again, ratio change again. 

Also, yes, talking US whole. despite states trying hide numbers, still compare total number deaths cases baseline be. 

If that, becomes pretty clear death count covid actually really freaking low compared actual, hit 200k deaths weeks ago. 

Following implications cause effect moving goalposts. 

Just freaking take seriously. Isn‚Äôt rule subreddit quality sources information? stuff get posted taken down? Yup, unfortunatelly, pandemic ao relevant virus that.  least hamsters need wear masks longer yay really hard keeping tiny ears üêπ Agree great see efforts made finding promising treatment, still pretty long way go. anyone one, humans  Yeah think makes sense mask mandate like, Alaska Montana, opposed larger cities. like states decide well.  Culling herd insurance industry. Hundreds billions liabilities suddenly erased books. Wall St must cackling glee gift Trump. That‚Äôs exactly meant! baffles grew around many selfish assholes (extended family) think nothing fellow citizens, care individual rights rather rights promised us all. sad part parents would, probably, boat siblings, come 2014.  seems r/coronavirus doesnt want vaccine subreddit become null void. 
You really want extent much possible 
r/coronavirus = r/Mueller get told come party here, throw ‚Äòsends‚Äô like that, never walked ‚Äòsend‚Äô seen anything like that‚Äù

Can get translation? religious holidays yet begun. Rosh Hashanah begins Friday. Two year olds? No. Five year olds protective people care about. Telling they‚Äôll protect grandmas grandpas they‚Äôll proud help. really seems like.. brace yourself.. it‚Äôs hard work tamp coronavirus community actually try.

A revelation, know. Ok wear mask public transportation take mask go shop.

Does mask help preventing corona inside shop yes no? Remember I'm wearing there. 

So ask self ""Does mask prevent spread, weating all."" 

Think bit it. Take time really let brain work this. answer. don‚Äôt. haven‚Äôt inside store since March haven‚Äôt wanted anything. They‚Äôre stubborn refuse change old habits.  I'm sure Canadians love you. Probably. die it, though. save .jpg images page. remove stigma painful test too, would serious step forward getting people comfortable.

The final move course would meaningful aid come positive isn‚Äôt fear impact testing positive. One potential silver lining pandemic many people managing long term effects covid-19, might give credence auto immune disorders. research, although absolutely important, also popular opinion someone auto immune problems hard specifically diagnose.  pediatrician told us expecting tough one kids year - cold flu. one year old sick last week, know could picked something - two friends boat. there, me, husband, nephew caught sniffles.

Apparently strong viruses there. walls new space üêº Norway, private PCR tests 97 USD. 

In Belgium private PCR tests 67 euro. Free government conditions. Source?  reopened places yesterday San Francisco... me, goof. objective reality.

Lots protestors got arrested, got let go fines.

The kid threw party got fined ¬£10,000.

That's because, kid threw party broke rules selfish reasons. deliberately broke law, got consequence.

Protestors break law. right protest guaranteed constitution.

Grow up. grow up, get consequences own. you. That's world works. Yes met someone thinks vaccine covid testing go far nose attaches brain allowing microchip lol probably get reinfected coronavirus cold several times life...  Social distancing prevent flu time prevent COVID. cases flu likely misdiagnosed COVID. Weird, would call people willing kill family amusement hateful ones. I'll ad usually remarkably better physical condition average person begin with. keep hearing much masks reduce likelihood infections (sometimes 90%) would expect decrease, collapse cases. Rather increase.

Edit: glad admit point psychological pressure. exactly case. wish politicians least honest it. employer gives face masks employees thinnest piece cloth could imagine. hold light see right - thinner undershirt. ""funny"" part medical facility. Still though, guess probably better nothing. Yahoo came article today saying church goers 16X likely get covid people! Like, fuck come think true? Sitting large, socially isolated room really 16X dangerous grocery store, post office, doctor's office, hospital, restaurant, house party?

Can link article? I'm curious source was. I'm assuming journalist Yahoo one making claim maybe look help understand think that's true Never mind. Pick fight china fine. It‚Äôs strategy called starve beast. ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù proudly violated rules bad results claim it‚Äôs rules deliberate treasonous sabotage. ^ third imposter Except nobody find quoted experiments researches showing wearing masks provide significant impact. link study demonstrating that? coming head state facing multiple corruption charges. 

Now gets put whole country house arrest three weeks. 

Something keep mind. claiming Italy Covid restrictions election year. Ergo, there's vast widespread conspiracy occurring rest world influence elections overstating risk virus even dangerous enough anyone needs avoid crammed Italy Isn‚Äôt even distancing anymore, ppl crammed together eating. don‚Äôt election November

These people cast lot alongside. meantime, rest us large swaths academia specializing virology epidemiology support arguments cursory search. Governor Newsom ordered indoor bars/restaurants, gyms, hair/nail salons close July 13. doubt re-open establishments based article. 
I said legit, gonna one gets it'll fault. ICUs effectively doubled capacity, means increase number sick patients peak factor 2 without overwhelming hospitals. Time reopen everything? produced test quantities months. one batch take 4 years. 7 billion doses 1 year (or even 6 months) question big factory needs be. Unless specific vaccine uses rare materials ? big dig delay testing works hazardous humans.

Seriously raising 19th century objections. even 20th century ones. Congrats, San Antonio! üëèüéâüöÄ pathetic it? really want understand rationale imposing curfews, virus would go sleep infect anyone past 10. date saw, sorry objectiveness, shitty countries populist leaders that.

These restrictions sound like exactly leader wants appear responsible actually anything would impact economy do. Damn early start? canceled back July lol think more- anti-establishment fetishism.

Critical thinking works established baseline considered ""trustworthy""

It good question authority America hell bent destroying institutions ""just because"" opposed sort valid reasoning. know presenting facts, seem agree with, considered fear-mongering? Sure, may turn much worse viral infections know yet, we? yes, realize influenza responsible far deaths folks realize far 'official' numbers Covid already \~ four times annual CDC stats influenza. yea, single-quoted official I'm pretty confident significantly underreported. American individualistic culture, sadly. something rooted American way living, changing take tremendous effort. Great point That's like saying ""If everyone country self-quarantined three weeks, we'd pretty much cases left could basically go back normal right after."" true, chance back March, continuously chance ever since. still taken it, even six months later.

So nope, gonna happen. would job either way. However would rather take hit meant one died? course. nonchalant assumption otherwise reflection you, that's sad. Nowhere America lockdowns. like countries did. never stopped anyone traveling all. Stop comparing covid flu, Jesus fucking Christ already take much every day. think you‚Äôre onto something might better therapy developing nations.

you dont wanna hear single payer? want small government? fine, US government longer allow intellectual property rights pharma. cannot patent drugs. Everyone make insulin drug according publicly available formulas results tested safety like now.

The idea pretty simple, get sick suffer unknown consequences depending circumstances, stay safe. don‚Äôt trust idiots I‚Äôm around enough actually read virus. rather gamble.

Additionally country maintaining flattened curve. many cases still. went back way life covid, would right bat boiling used time effectively beat virus. countries homework go back normal, US haven't. previous antibody ""breakthroughs"" months shown sign real progress, hence comment. clearly spent much time resort pool think relying people social distancing blowing snot water realistic. wait Jedward hears this. guess guys still like... week fall? brother always self-important petulant idiots.

A COVID-iot Sandwich. [The moment president uttered this, moment stopped trusting USA numbers August 27th, [Capacity testing across US... Gee, wonder 200-300 NEW cases per day NYC. 800 new cases per day NYS. control relative somewhat subjective. Personally, I'ld like see number much lower go restaurant given virus bit unpredictable immediate family high risk category. Whether want go restaurant course you. would take credit creating vaccine too, that's case. said nothing economics, thats one many factors along mental health impacts, missed screenings cancer diseases, stunted social development kids, etc.

It‚Äôs almost *shouldn‚Äôt listening one person group* enlist experts multiple aspects advise crisis. Ya know...like Sweden!

# Nobody asked, Bill, fuck already. Yeah, I've known quite people gotten one got real bad. cousin got tested taste food symptoms. Another kid knew trouble breathing running went get exam turned developed blood clot lungs, never symptoms. roommate girlfriend also got light fever couple days. another cousin wife kept testing positive *a month half* neither ever symptoms. 

My friend got bad, got real bad though. asthma may something it, sick around 20 days went hospital started feel better. least month recovered still troubles breathing sort workout even walking far times. he's mid-20s. really think people nice intelligent first place? I‚Äôve using adjustable strapped respirators 8210 similar, snapped like use 3 4 like clock work..so adjustable straps way go you‚Äôre issue. read said /most common coronaviruses'. Lol, yes dude, read. you? Read one comment know said. And, also linked another study edit corroborates study similar coronavirus strains. Jeez, read, you? waste time. Yeah headline entirely false. Gates said trusts safe vaccine developed. can‚Äôt spread misleading false information here, since sub essential many people get news covid crisis!  oh Answer: never tried gain control first place America hard time covid. friend thinks may covid haven‚Äôt gotten tested sought treatment. reason , said, uncertainty cost. can‚Äôt risk medical bill hospital stay may put financial hardship. 

buT CaNT uNIVerSAl heALTH cARe I‚Äôm scientist yes, everyone concerned lack transparency. It‚Äôs one thing withhold information like public it‚Äôs another thing withhold NIH frankly, HIPAA excuse doesn‚Äôt hold water. everybody asking takes long read [this](http://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Vaccine.html) article vaccines manufactured. Even getting working vaccine lengthy complicated process can't rushed reasons obvious. Unfortunately one things takes long takes grow strains virus exact right conditions. seed virus quality becomes poorer time eventually disposed replaced.

Unfortunately working biological material hard limits place can't mitigate. make sure batch vaccine safe one bad batch kills thousand people that's completely new problem well. 

For better worse we're going living situation while.   fair easily scariest Halloween we've sorry hear u/dr_mcstuffins Good health often taken granted, S.O. try remind gone blink... illness, car accident, fault happens often times getting back. Everyone, included, appreciative good health it. substantial second spike far across world? Would seem regions large spike dips relatively low numbers, seen second spike resurface? Obviously preventative measures place, masks/distancing etc seems people locality spike, judging human nature take long people think things fine loosen mitigating measures. Yes, exactly meant say here, current government lacks planning takes decisions whim apologies, I'm stupid :(

Apparently can't differentiate ""Coronation"" ""Coronavirus"" something. Time get reddit break. solution? 

The solution South Korea, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, ect. Many countries overcome pandemics public health methods alone. governments supposed citizens cared heath well neighbors follow solution. 

This cult rocket science. basic epidemiology. still dealing government tried half measured best country never completely committed necessary beat particular pandemic. last comment removed political. statistical video touches fair New Jersey fantastic right COVId wise. really think children comprehend keeping community safe means? second part stellar idea though glad government working tirelessly control mitigate covid. 10000 cases saw prime Minister television almost every day. millions cases, never see except soldiers Chinese border beat Chinese distract nation. criticisms remain, NIH responsible hold.  hate much usually people fence mask wearing. type wear forced, wear it.

my parents ""we sore throat 2 weeks back february doctor sure was, probably it"" can't convince doctor going run 100 test find exactly cold have, probably especially older etc zero issues afterward one around also got sick.

Shoutout /u/ridddle /u/disenfranchised_14.  wonder whether Bill trusted covid vaccine kinds articles don‚Äôt belong sub get misinterpreted.  ‚ÄúIt imposes freedom!! Also, don‚Äôt think abortions right, allowed them!!! BLM protestors also shouldn‚Äôt allowed protest, they‚Äôre criminals!!!‚Äù 

-shit hear antimasker parents time, covid really left distaste right wings never control.  administration voters idiots. way plenty colleges creating hotspots, also something seems dependent size school student community. son goes small university (4100 students total including graduate level) students generally mindful other. DIII real financial loss limiting sports training intrasquad competition only. Athletic training groups limited 10 people total including coaches (i.e. 2 coaches, 8 athletes training group). Training done masks (my son runs cross country run masks on). Classes remote dorm rooms first 2 weeks classes adequate distancing arranged remote entire semester. Hand washing and/or sanitizer stations everywhere. Plexi dividers added including classrooms. Traffic direction management added every building. shutting week Thanksgiving (assuming make long) every student moving finish semester home. Kids parents told student caught hosting attending large gathering suspended semester refund.

So far, 4000+ tests, they've 2 positive. Athletes tested every week. random sampling rest student body also tested every week. contract nearby lab process results they're getting back 24 hours less and, like every school, special quarantine housing set someone tests positive. One two positives move-in testing, 4 days later everyone suspects roommate first positive.

All I'm actually paying LESS semester Fall 2019. got discount reduced time dorms offset annual tuition increase. also got ""refund"" last semester kids kept home March ""spring break"". everything absolutely go sideways hurry, wife remain cautiously optimistic son able semester ""in person"". never, lol True story back kid, family left candy went trick treating foldable table. came back empty plate table thrown half way across yard, well hole front door partially made glass YMMV Probably meant per capita, *new* cases, something else. Total cases February today isn‚Äôt good metric. I‚Äôve going. it‚Äôs almost one one (or one two affair days). It‚Äôs small gym classes normal times like 5-6 people. it‚Äôs 1 2 simultaneous online classes. I‚Äôm taking risk.

Everything online/curbside. anyone need go store? Hello! edited clarify I‚Äôm referring full second lockdown. you‚Äôre Melbourne? it‚Äôs still first lockdown? cancer effectively bunch different diseases? e.g. leukemia white blood cell cancer, melanoma skin cell cancer. Pretty extreme irony way see film sacrifices people make eliminate chances ever exposed deadly virus sit room unavoidably expose chance contracting deadly virus. TIFF imagining venn diagram overlap two circles? really read way. unreasonable question metrics dictate policy responses. Especially light learned pcr testing thresholds.  That‚Äôs nature shifting goal line, nothing ever good enough. doesn‚Äôt matter CV19 numbers now, deal it. Also, masks clearly aren‚Äôt solution, charades? know long-term effects.

Could people return normal years.

Or

It could people suffer chronic heart/lung disease significantly increased risk death road.

We know. Fascinating. stand corrected. That's say ""covid flu"" camp. That's inane.

Thank correction. I'll stop saying saying, obviously misled earlier year. Yeah, basing article snapshot worldometers without insight numbers really sloppy reporting. Fire destroys coronavirus completely creationist, denialist, ignoramus, ideologue around asshole? missed anything?

Thanks, friend, input invaluable. particular, post add growing body evidence that

A. extended lockdowns result massive growth aggression intolerance society

B. addition virus-is-not-real idiots right, also large crowd we-only-like-science-we-agree-with left.

(B) might consequence (A)

And, nature article way contradict prediction 2-4 months California's total death rate much closer Sweden's (and Arizona's)..

PS. one thing, Covid articles dated Spring general taken HUGE grain salt (that one submitted MARCH 30): much changed last 4 months, random redditor might indeed know leading researchers Spring. makes think money going towards 'it' ? üòâ

*Edit: I'm denying vaccines cost money. I'm saying probably overcharged United States, everybody else world resolved selling vaccines financing cost.* so? Probably individuals. mean basic concept. someone pushes COVID increase chance complications, someone pushes bout influenza similar issue occur.

It's weird many act like COVID first virus ever complications. long tail recovery, despite viral infections linked issues. California actual lockdowns summer? 

I read closings that, like bars gyms, churches couldn‚Äôt meet indoors, sorts things constitute state lockdown understand term?

If that‚Äôs bad headline. hate people advocating trick treat. would thought, take bunch young adults throughout country, known practice social distancing want college experience (just another word drinking partying) concentrate small area pandemic expect outbreaks. way country handled pandemic outright embarrassing; colleges knew going happen, took steps testing strict COVID policies (see North Eastern) absolute minimum (see Boston College).

I'm boat you, think we're going get one calendar year.

I'm genuinely optimistic we'll vaccine end calendar year. widely available late Q1/Q2 next year.

Also, whether first available candidate end best/last also open question.  Hello Melbourne. Currently week five six week lockdown. hopefully lose curfew. gotten mine cut since January, would normally 20 minutes might little longer. Hello you‚Äôre reading please follow stricter guidelines states enforce. Wear masks, distance, don‚Äôt risky activities. Please anything me, immunocompromised stranger wanting die young age.

I‚Äôm sure cheap available need ( outside USA course) Omg I'm dying here! Thank truly felt laugh. needed it!  [operation Lol... read article... even first comment matter....

I think fix got. buy glasses hoping real conversation you. pretty disappointing intention that. 

It's also showing concerns (i.e. political) rather following science. sci-fi thing stupid, life pretty bleak lot people. divide rich poor grown chasm. Social mobility feels nonexistent. started nursing school far joke. distance learning thing working. many people know unemployed, taken huge pay cuts. Shits bad. town food bank slammed, people can't pay rent. Eventually they're going start evicting people. know rule, correct time, definitely correct time. evidence limited, exists. disease still rather new depth studies take time.

I'm sure internet. 

I find curious unable see evidences face masks help time, clame don't, even could worse, without evidence that. think forced labor penalty property crime instead incarceration great idea. Save prisons violent offenders sex offenders. Half battle drug‚Äôs ‚Äòeffectiveness‚Äô...the half ‚Äòside effects‚Äô. good news drug effectiveness article contains single vague reference side effects. cost lot lives so. Seems worse knew, didn‚Äôt act. text article, even say trusts companies FDA. article:

1. Grabs quote Gates says FDA messed plasma situation 

2. Grabs another independent quote says trusts companies making vaccines

3. Says ""some"" Americans putting trust companies FDA wrongfully says Gates position well, without quoting it.

The article jumbled mess completely false headline. think real issue long term side effects Covid. cough, think people could deal that. people get heart damage, others nerve, even worse already depressed generation get chronic fatigue rest life.  Brexit dividend come. Scroll down. anti Chinese propaganda meant help shift blame certain person U.S. Wow, virus abides laws virology. Great! Multiple things bad health time. Determining policies maximize function overall population health massive exercise opportunity cost. Everyone masks inside live UK too. Worst EU currently. like government policies LOVE one! everything protect people die. political? global COVID-19 vaccine race, Chinese ~~shot~~ bribe receives first foreign approval Somewhat comparable. 183 confirmed influenza deaths children 2017-18, bad flu year.

However count influenza deaths well. Also kept kids home year, we've kept COVID death rate kids artificially extremely low.

So COVID probably deadlier kids seasonal influenza. Gates also perplexed testing still conducted using nasopharyngeal swabs ‚Äî unpleasant procedure people liken brain stabbed. Gates Foundation led research showed swabs circled nostril accurate far easier administer. also don‚Äôt trigger bouts coughing spread virus. plenty circumstantial evidence, smoking gun. Oh snap... political infectious immunity them.... 

...and put t-shirts scream little louder backyard instead living room. Happened pandemic well. Report then. What's reddit police going do? Kick door lol? They're experts Bill Gates not. Case closed That's really fair assessment. claim know reluctant officially declare pandemic, statements certainly indicated knew seriousness situation, early stages pandemic.  literally banned live, God luck ladies like around lol FDA would run trials vaccine US approved sale US market anyways. logic follow. Nah, think race right now. vaccines come everyone gets infected first. Obviously vaccine comes works virtually side effects... lives saved. not, majority humanity infected, many dying survive antibodies defend themselves. virus continue even vaccine gets created. Viruses extremely hard kill off, better winning lottery killing off. 
Ps; I'm expert. general info school articles. mistakes, please correct them. father 8, 1 relationship. home school, always have.

The socioeconomic paradigm needs adapt change, never sustainable. need change adapt, life style lived new humanity changing rapid rate, America 7% worlds population. 

I feel you; empathy sympathy. 

That cannot changed must endured. Wave 2 Europe come, US getting theirs. Bwahahaha enjoyed Guess make cut 33 anymore lol Falling going way summer. No, people exposed elsewhere someone chose go wedding.

Hey, remember promised would end COVID? wrong!!!!!

/s 10 deaths?

And lololol, think college ""reality""? Oh man, life going hit hard. National trend still seems going though? best explanation two-fold

1) even know prone position would help patients hit NY, let alone antivirals cheap steroids could significantly increase chance survival. California later hit states things going them

2) NY got hit WAY harder testing showed. onset, positive test rates 50%. NY missed 90% initial cases likely. NYC millions cases April.  Fauci probably best them, even admitted lied us masks. 

Birx, kidding? proven liar. 

So who?

Btw, report stuff like coronavirus damage brain?

Is discuss things different view? Really? Based real. recently diagnosed testicular cancer treatment (surgery active surveillance every 2 months) Obviously led lot reading subject, found pre-1970, 5-yea survival rates 78%, basically 99%. massive improvement regards treatment, learned disease, much COVID although cases rising, mortality hospitalizations bad beginning. progressive learning experience generally optimistic about. Bloomberg- [Xi Vows China Share Vaccine Gives Full It‚Äôs robbing rules place violated. don‚Äôt understand point. i‚Äôm even Floridian i‚Äôm tired whiplash up/down cases. get ish together FL think Pfizer Mississippi's per capita death rate higher every single country except Peru. God bless abandoning dogs 2 months ago pretty much everyone San Diego wearing masks see one blue moon. always pulled down... Treating cancer definitely lucrative curing it. good would lying intend distribute vaccine globally?

As poster said ""China first develop produce vaccine massive boon position world-leader medicine technology."" keep vaccine accomplish distribute vaccine globally safe, also accomplish that. China risk giving countries something reasonably sure safe, would best interests. Yeah, one anywhere ever said masks cure-all.

Masks one recommended pandemic safety measures, along with: social distancing (actually effective masks); washing hands often well; avoiding crowds, especially indoors.

And safety measures. 

There cure. one immunity unless already it. vaccine yet. It‚Äôs highly contagious. People appear feel perfectly healthy still spread everyone room they‚Äôre unmasked closer 6 feet apart. 

It fatal, especially over-60s conditions like asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes many common conditions.

Please, wear mask you‚Äôre public, especially indoors. Follow public health measures. Please. people still privately gathering masks? Masks good thing reduce transmission. Distancing still best thing.  didn‚Äôt know risk factors beginning. Lost? like punted away like live middle school kickball. Cancer defeated?

That's great news! Yeah fine far know, that's good least! really. It‚Äôs worldwide pandemic countries starting see another wave, Spain France. Fauci said take gram Vitamin C twice day, mention dose Vitamin D. take 2000 Vitamin twice day ""These patients likely represent worst-case scenario. infected people end hospital, Gholamrezanezhad says overall rate intermediate-term lung damage likely much lower ‚Äî best guess less 10%.

Two months ago...7 day average testing 770k
Yesterday...7 day average 713k

During time period, % positive went 8.1 4.9. Hospitalizations 52k 31k.

Less infected people, less people hospitals, less tests. It‚Äôs pretty simple, unless trying get clicks. big surprise. Trump really, really, REALLY fucked us over. Don‚Äôt forget pee, essential proper pool atmosphere second wave here. beloved lockdowns

What lockdowns following recommendations FHM actual freaking law? Land borders incredibly difficult control, especially huge country like China course local cases go undetected. Looks like rules still place  fact, thought public health officials Sweden concerned winter resurgence? 

They prepared different scenarios, Tegnell also said Thursday's press conference something along lines two things suggest Sweden affected second wave, Tegnell says: Firstly, restrictions time, provides stability predictability people's behavior changed much. Secondly patients, therefore easy new spread pick speed.""   important thing people come get information open society also restrictions, even 


Also article thread, quoted Today, architect Sweden‚Äôs lighter-touch approach says country ‚Äúa low level spread‚Äù occasional local outbreaks. 

We see going stand corrected assume hamsters...and poor little guys burping night. Isn‚Äôt return import? Wow still talking herd immunity. many cattle must die? 
I really dislike idea may need accept like flu. many ailments, need  long socially distanced, you‚Äôre good! Yeah important context. mean kind obvious negative U.S. Somehow idea would incentivizing people get infected sound outlandish ü§£üòÖ hear you! 

Okay: magic today September 16, 2019 could anything, would spend day? course American... cause problems everywhere, we? well, look tests used, provide sources claims.

as is, nothing empty assertions. buckets cold water fix ! Yeah, even Chinese suburbs sky scrapers buildings. 4 bed detached houses lots land. ""I'm shitty person, deal consequences"" Erm US exactly help Germany day either.

Yes, fun parties. According Diederik Gommers, likely due better treatments. would result less ICU capacity needed number infections. Also, survival chances higher before. sign virus getting less severe.

The report Dutch ICU association found here: yeah football back....

I pissed wearing mask. Ill pissed 4 months Covd still problem GOP PEOPLE COUNTRY completely fucked something badly. international borders closed movement. govt failed properly inform many times even instigated things like wearing masks. made pandemic political, metaphorically coming together working together, caused opposite constant failure politicizing this. blame them, fine 99%. Exactly. almost like communication, awareness clear example top (leadership) foreign concepts naive people. SMH. never said second infection *will* worse. said know. also know reinfection common. evidence common? Please share source. Yeah, maybe vaccine even reinfecting phenomenon, strains virus maybe take long time. Maybe also treatment eventually people get infected. choice patiently wade out. Just, choice. Vitamin C large doses give diarrhea. holistic doctor recommends high doses Vitamin C get cold, ""bowel tolerance"". Meaning, lower dose get diarrhea. dose Fauci talking that. Hawaii. Locked down. Shit's miserable. Oh I‚Äôm sure got relentless pressure ‚Äî especially given times rare female. prevailed. isn‚Äôt statue somewhere DC, be. don‚Äôt government. People themselves, selfish ones, part problem too. Fly em here. Though, I've got enough N95 masks last good while. Cases pretty much nonexistent point, I'm (hopefully) going back work soon, so... plan to! know, teen years, may want mom going anymore. That's depressing me... especially year ruined. 



Thank giving candy kids ages. Makes sad people refuse give candy teens. Yes actually will. called predictive text reason program thought talking president. whatever floats boat.

Edit: see wanted say ever floats boat(goat) stupid thing agree me. Germany bought made massive amounts end needing. Lots ventilators well. sitting around nothing. suppose better many enough. Seriously please feel free take daughter trick treating long wants to. Everyone shows door costume gets candy. don‚Äôt care old are, sharing magi Halloween me. I'm 36 look 15 years younger guy anti-capitalist anti-consumerist come, treasured childhood memories involve trick treating Halloween. It‚Äôs magical night people want kids experience it. said, I‚Äôm making individual gift bags candy treats sitting outside ‚Äútake one‚Äù sign, opening door every kid town. seems like best compromise come pandemic.  daughter younger, would probably idea.

Kinda neat, seems like would safe everyone participating something like brought along lots hand sanitizer. everyone wore masks, obviously.
I wonder anyone would dress like Bane... topic: ""This due restrictions imposed several governments wake COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions travel, embarkation disembarkation ports, quarantine measures, reductions available flights limits issuing visas passports. "" Eh em..... ~Tell Tell something know Something know!~ See outdoors distancing place? provide risk estimate based area. Seeing people outdoors without masks distancing *still* safer indoors mask distancing. Fun Fact: can't even question head country piece shit never held even single press conference whole tenure media can't stop praising him. Tell more... peak level infection? High vitamin C consumption increases oxalate excretion increase risk calcium oxalate kidney stones, especially Great indenial read 'The US even close getting Covid-19.' one cases definitely comparing flu. Flu mutates like crazy, coronavirus slow comparison.  That's debt works. inherit parents' debts die. owe charged assets reduces size estate pass on. might mean get inherit house without paying hospital that's inherited debt, house free clear pass on. **its virus, bloody mary**

Have read latest reports coming long term side affects this?

Anecdotally, ten people know this: two dead, 6 lasting issues (over 4 months now), 2 recovered apparent issues.

That says Mary not. Yeah sure. us though government response lot better us current Abbott test prevalent false positive incredibly low. false negative however high looking N Protein antibodies, spike antibodies.

For instance correct antibody test administered like Mt Sinai test, 99% positive swab confirmed cases tested positive antibodies.

The Abbott test verified 30 people hospitalized.

It misses many, many infections people Covid didn‚Äôt make particular type antibody.

There several studies welcome search for. Actual cases likely 8-10x confirmed cases. That‚Äôs still bad scary realize many, many infected.

Let‚Äôs top pretending tests emergency approved FDA somehow amazing.  NJ. Hellish landscape science denial. Wife pretty vocal fucked people need wear fucking mask. goes work gym everyday min wage, clean properly. bring Christmas gives ""no way, coming family's Christmas party, getting this"". Sure, I'll worst case die, otherwise respiratory issues whole life following, best case risk someone else's safety go holiday party nobody even at. Idk anymore, I'm checked reality. fuck.  I'm actually horrified saw ""anti-vaxx"" used verb. record, WW2 survival rate little 97.5% deployed US soldiers. we're nearing morality rate soldiers deployed world war brushing like big deal. also Japan handled pandemic. legally mandated shutdown. general public guidelines pretty straightforward. Public compliance high kept number deaths per-capita low number.   can‚Äôt tell you‚Äôre ironic yeah, reason. wweeeeeeeeeeks Oh. Super. agree. I‚Äôm suffering sheltering place, weirds people might loving it. great news choose eat restaurant hobo spit mouths.

I mean, 25% indoor capacity actually keep restaurants profitable (I find doubtful) infections low, people welcome try luck. I'll occasional take I'm feeling risky. average Flu vaccine can't given 10 million people given year would imagine.

We serious education problem country. It‚Äôs statement ridiculous. Really...it‚Äôs going *years* step foot inside restaurant again? *YEARS?* It‚Äôs silly. People states dining months cases, hospitalizations, fatilities continue decrease. person saying never eat inside restaurant virus nonsensical. engage risky behavior like dining in, going movie, attending party.

I mean feel like I'd something like ""gather 5 people"" first lol?? get much :\ know one rogue pair tits everyone slobbing on, told special day. Yeah, guess problem people fucking lazy...40% us apparently. It‚Äôs similar people trying get data Soviet Union ‚Äî information either doctored erased They‚Äôre professional athletes mansions get everything provided them. students probably campus mixed students might taking precautions partying like college students  Last checked bundle apples cheaper box cookies. sure, guess poverty reason. thanksgiving everyone goes home now. Fall Breaks cancelled. hell even take Labor Day off. Christmas break 6 weeks long, go home isolate normal break would even start. So, trump vaccine then.

&amp;#x200B;

fuck hate 2020 america. You‚Äôre completely wrong. Google Covid symptom prevalence. It‚Äôs first link CDC. Sore throat runny nose present around half covid patients. one don‚Äôt educate people shove sugar asses due poverty inequality. system. many apex scientists US... maybe 2-5k ?

If stage walkout demand new rational policymaking apparatus US - they'd win. Hands down.

Literally, EVERY industry would melt. peak always ‚Äú10-14 days now‚Äù since may *Muffled sounds bunker* know someone must named also paved way Covid deaths. Obviously. 


When say ""there's family resemblance people"", saying there's family, cannot name ONE characteristic share (some eyes, others hair, etc.). exactly Wittgenstein used concept family resemblance: criticism idea essence. 


In words, take group outsiders want reject, try find criteria reject ,you'll find people group fit criteria well.


""Throwing bricks"" good one: true swede would that... seriously?


(I realised, writing this, there's correspondance made G√∂del's theorem... never thought before... ie find fixed set criteria ""being swede"", might exclude people swedes fit criteria; hand, include swedes, able find set criteria fit... criticism racism... (oh, sorry, meant ""cultural purity"", keep forgetting new thing now...)  ) Meanwhile, us actually live China Vietnam family know countries, every single time new case detected, person's movements past two weeks published national news, everyone person's neighborhood contact person rounded testing potential quarantine.

News media seem pretty transparent virus infected cases right now. would rather vaccines produced right US, good things made India? least Covid exciting slaving away every day. Maybe that's type flawed logic people utilizing. Sorry believe ""multiple people know China said people still getting it"" I'm certain bold face lie.

I believe new cases anytime new cases heavily reported on. still many tests done, need test multitudes reasons, think cases would picked on. undetected cases know quickly would snowball crisis. get preferential ticket treatment alot people get tested thst. system talking about? system live free country people choice want? wait till Winter people traveling vacation instead Midwest yep, Putin Trump

Yeltsin basically American asset Maybe it‚Äôs whatever system produced bunch fat fucks, it‚Äôs literally killing people result. Hopefully, Biden wins, brings light actual records originally said meddling Trump's lackeys Again, I'm disagreeing people. think states either went far conflict interest restrictions:

* People get pulled driving Stay home order. 
* States favor opening Casinos higher capacities public venues (I'm looking Nevada Michigan). fact, case Casinos allowed larger % capacity open vs Churches is, I've gathered listening lawyers parties, Unconstitutional one reason - treats churches differently Casinos. issue restrictions themselves, fact can't treat religious groups differently, regardless that's favorable not. restrictions same, fine. There's actual ruling yet. 

All I'm saying system (and law) basically says ""the Federal Government cannot anything unless law explicitly gives right so, otherwise powers belong States People"" court system whose job determine legality State Federal laws relation parent law. I‚Äôve read three studies talking benefits vitamin D. looks promising. Chinese going them, China can't trusted per POTUS, so...? percentage swedish households singe generation? compare answer question. understand important?

Yes, factor. One many.. doubt trumps everything else. Also main issue 20 year olds living 50-year olds, main issue 70-year old living younger generations.

There factors play US; masks, less dependence public can't manage mandatory lockdown, manage voluntary compliance?

I follow logic. voluntary? (Are Sweden's business/gathering restrictions voluntary? think even are, irrelevant). Weaker != voluntary. Weaker means society stays open.

And, yes, US managed severe longer lockdown Sweden. I'm sure US would managed weaker lockdown better managed stronger one. people tend compliant less drastic measures.

The point is: US states (cough, California) still trying implement fairly strong longdown... death rates still climbing ultimately end Sweden's somewhat higher level... Sweden stayed light-lockdown course much open economy, open schools low infection rates.

PS. fully expect US end worse Sweden (due factors pointed out). hard(er) lockdowns donot mitigate all. US end Sweden's death rates anyway. enough resources? value education? India=2^x Ok, well reddit social media. probably diversify include news outlets cite sources people reddit say really dumb shit. guy posts h3h3 posting nonsense - shocker! Come already. Manafort repaying Russian oligarchs, trump tower meetings russian agents, rudy russian intelligence ukraine, Donald saying believes putin western intel agencies helsinki, response belarus navalny poisoning even bounties US troops. obvious need be? Video money bag exchanges kiss ring? must small minority. that's first reasonable explanation I've seen.

I'll admit bizarre comfort staying home often, I'm still eager return normal. Can't imagine wearing mask post-pandemic unless I'm sick. always thought strip clubs historically cleanliest places! Right? people seem take talk balance crazy cry open all. 

Reality recognize covid horrible there‚Äôs covid, working prevent public spread mitigate impact restrictions. 

It‚Äôs one other. isn‚Äôt easy certainly risk full shelter place focusing almost entirely one issue months end clearly disaster important things too. Look posts. Fauci wanted say know enough Covid-19 know masks would help, I'd understand.

That's said. 

He said deliberately misled public preserve masks first responders. That's essentially sacrificing 1 2 lives save 10 lives elsewhere. 

My problem judgment. He's logistics expert. there's tons articles elsewhere government ignoring need masks early. Perhaps emphasis masks important could've accelerated PPE production. Maybe force Trump invoke Defense Production Act force mask production. 

We'll never know. Im reading constant stories posted one 25 year old suffering long term damage extremely rare case even rarer death age range. That‚Äôs shocking Oh no, agree, I'm saying normal things even reach point. think credible data comes reputable scientists outside US, FDA would consider approval disaster imminent. giving vaccine away. paying multinational corporation manufacture India it‚Äôs cheaper produce lot quickly, translates lives saved.

If India nationalize vaccine chemical manufacturing infrastructure, profit driven corporation foreign government would want business India anymore. would really damn stupid, won‚Äôt it. somehow think 3 row means Trump win again. Ok. fine high = increasing chance corruption.

I happy take $2,000 filling $10,000 fine letter. they‚Äôre gonna play anyway, think good idea. Better know person sitting next test rather surrounded people ‚Äújust thought sniffles went game anyway‚Äù. We've known months NSAID's effective treating treating this. 
The new thing seems vitamin D, well convalescent plasma - anyone news that? Lots states opened indoor dining kept open idea vaccines improperly tested FDA politically financially motivated staples anti-vaxx movement decades, ""vaccines cause autism"" memified poke fun movement blown bigger really Looks like virus affect respiratory system affects circulatory system staying hydrated H2O2 protect us Covid-19? don‚Äôt know got runny nose read multiple times sore throat like 11% 5% runny nose nonexistent yeahh, wish could, nearly 30 plan start trying children starting summer, dont want push back 2021. CT state right next door got hit hard NY initial surge. reopened indoor dining 50% June 18th seen real increase cases since opened. shown ok states rate gets low enough test trace slow stop spread much possible. CT's positivity hovered little little 1% past three months. Maybe people leaving become refugees Nevada.... Teachers aren‚Äôt underpaid everywhere US, likely live areas country education undervalued. Factz ""Shelter place take money also get sued giving everyone shit education experience crippling debt zero job outlook""  australia people even fought woolies pack toilet rolls lol, guess that's we'll known pandemic

Referring video two women trolley toilet paper fighting big woman bag rolls got dropped onto floor?

Yeah, moment got immortalized. Interestingly though, minorities. Well get kids butts clinics. Agree, that‚Äôs problem. Timing problem. We‚Äôd need trial scaling type vaccine would take time. Putin's working America social media 8+ solid years. results. Maybe ignorant stubborn collective before, middle-aged American last ten years feel different. think U.S. administration lifetime would politicized COVID-19 top-down. US citizens still allowed UK? happens, sure heck be. want one decide, bit bad decision.  case CCP lie virus, time letting foreigners covid ridden areas, rest fumbled responses issue. gotten far CCP absolute worst.

As response U.S., Trump himself. FDA CDC rules place made response much much worse. New York Times ran story Dr. Helen Chu University Washington thought case, asked could test, straight told ""You right kind clinic"". ran test anyways, breaking law, confirming case, giving young person's school massive head start response. saved lives, unarguably, response FDA goddamned cease desist. running right kind clinic remember? 

Then CDC mandated tests allowed CDC tests, tested State ran testing facilities. tried bogart response, U.S. based diagnostic companies already providing testing countries legally allowed kickstart economy scale U.S.

The shit spread thick, none woulda horrendous issue CCP worst government near possible.  Goddamn fucked everyone this, probably helped major businesses Walmart, Target, Best Buy, started requiring masks around time. That's great. that's decision make. That's question logistics administrator. idea enough PPE hospitals ludicrous. U.S. government could literally seize PPE tomorrow redirect hospitals.

Fauci's decision like Churchill's decision Coventry. British intercepted secret messages Coventry would bombed. Churchill nothing bc want Germans know British broke enigma code. Churchill made decision prime minister. understandable though morally challenging decision. prime minister needs . want code-breaker making decision like this. 

Fauci's role tell public disease act accordingly. can't honest, STFU. Say nothing mask issue. Say they're still researching. discourage people. Tool bad word laypeople weirdly ‚Äúpro-virus‚Äù. think happy accident better term. 

[For instance people sub yesterday posted happy masks common US they‚Äôd wear covid passed even they‚Äôre sick don‚Äôt like showing face outside world. large contingent mentally damaged humans find virus coincide nicely objections judged rest humanity. Sheltering place positive them. Hiding face positive. Contactless delivery closed stores positives. dunno, articles get this, pressure might add start something it.

I know stories people using moment step fitness let‚Äôs real, we‚Äôre six months something that‚Äôs worse unhealthy population big joke people bought flour bake. covid-19 19 real thing sure isn‚Äôt helping.

Now gyms disaster, it‚Äôs blazing hot areas, almost time freezing others, many people struggling get let alone afford weights decent food health public service messages &amp; programs help basically disappeared. 

High time actually start addressing impacts here, everyone home anyways least say tried. MUH POINTLESS COMMENT Republicans ever back constitution science? missing something here????

I mean I'm still young, get it?  hell man.... know mind. Pandemics scale rare one building legal system around one event (which ***not*** prepared it). issue law? get mad people buck laws/restrictions protecting COVID, talk violating law enforce law.... that's never good thing.

As usual, really need guidance issue wish SCOTUS would step tell everyone can/can't done protect people. believe system allows general suspension rights state emergency. go far, think President *has* invoke Insurrection Act. Probably good idea use COVID-19 current social climate.

Ultimately, hardest part handling Pandemic convince people self-isolate, stay home, etc? 

* Arresting putting jail could spread there. 
* Fining people much could render unable pay fine due lack work and..... end jail anyway. 
* Making punishments weak(like live) one care violate spread virus anyway.

You one two things country snuff virus pandemic:

1. Authoritarian Gov't *make* people stay home.
2. culture decided, vast majority, what's better nation rather themselves.

It's saddening think can't come together Pandemic get rid quickly. Partially due culture *needing* tell everyone disagrees us wrong duped are. Partially because, culturally, US whole common EU specific European country. spread society many different sub-cultures always make difficult really, truly come together time :( meant actual surveillance (testing) like Spanish flu, would hard pressed think still horrible virus circulating say NYC low areas. Therefore rose would distinct first second wave. comparing flu since don‚Äôt really aggressively test low times really rely sick people coming medical care. USA like playing Pandemic beginner difficulty US dealing COVID 9-10 shrieking article whose *worst case scenario* whole GLOBE vaccinated *HALF 9-10 year timespan.*

Time little original. problem well informed anymore, use better reps held higher standard, moment citizen united happened gave government ones money. Yeah, R0 2 high influenza. show local documentary ""Contagion II: Bloodbath ICU""? make sense colleges would reopen place responsibility spreading COVID students. Unless... money along... makes sense. Allowing indoor dining vaccine deployed lead cancellation indoor dining... Hah. guys elected Bush second term shit. realize country live in? cares insular stupidity, enjoy flying 737 Max ground bro No, got right. think sparsely filled stadium counts 'massive gathering' I'd assume wearing masks enforced, personally see high-risk situation. indoor frat parties much concerning. own. advocating herd immunity US, know close half million deaths could result. more.

It's acknowledging trend US encouraging 200k deaths six months, think we'll another six months % percent positives. Literally first article. Yeah know Google, however inept homework, ya going people living high income countries getting vaccinated 2024.

Okay thanks clarifying I'm fucked lol still make less correct said article. Jokes them, time get vaccine least half population already virus. India merely produces already developed US countries, mainly reduce cost.

There huge difference able develop something new vs producing. related wildfires, it‚Äôs trending downwards months multiple studies show masks helpful slowing spread. mean second wave can't happen, it'd worse masks.   live California, said wouldn‚Äôt updating numbers anytime soon, health department evacuated due fires. even knows sub incredibly US-centric general. People comments even need mention usually, guess US. Sweden one highest deaths per capita world, masks needed certain countries indicate effective. want understand it.  want told think.

case counts indeed undercounts.

so agree way 6 million cases counted.

but 20 percent looks like New York city worst outbreak US. There's way country whole approaches 20 percent.

You seem taking idea cases could much tenfold undercount conclude is, that's source also shitty. Pun intended. know accurate sewage measurements are. seems obvious problem distinguishing houses individuals. 10 times really exact mean 10 times.

That problem media news social. rewarded extremism. Calm even mindedness boring go business.

To bad also creates global atmosphere conspiracy theory misinformation now.  communist

You keep using word. think means think means. saying disorder madness. result unprepared emergency response lockdowns lock tens millions people center pandemic CDC already made laughingstocks. keep going back forth virus spread. One day say it‚Äôs spread surfaces, next say isn‚Äôt. Let math you. 20% 200k people died it, 100% infection rate would 1 million people dead. Also CDC puts total mortality rate average closer 250k deaths. skeptical without jumping conclusion everyone lying everything, still, actually provided evidence back opinion, frankly, one sounding emotional bit crazy. Medical experts also understand Southern Hemisphere non-existent flu season social distancing Yeah, I'm American. 

So know pro CCP mindset we? Canadian here. I'm kidding, point time, would afraid seeing American entering country someone China. think saying don‚Äôt controlled fall already late. 

Just like saw shift summer sunbelt, virus start showing upper Midwest, gets colder intensify. Well.. handled outbreak pretty much better rest world even infact hid let get China.

But. lockdowns hard..  9 months later us chilling mask wearing making liberal. symptoms crazy Wuhan?*

A lot early twitter videos see faked intentionally miscaptioned Falun Gong cultists (see key words like Epoch Times, New Tang Dynasty NTD handles) try spread panic amongst Chinese diaspora, hopes FUD (Fear/Uncertainty/Doubt) would leak Chinese mainland CCP would collapse latest crisis. Twitter banned China Falun Gong. cult funded US Senate years.

Of course, nobody expected US flunk spectacularly give CCP example show citizens much better CCP rule.  Seriously, opening campuses still thing stage? go virtual couple months more? Even vaccine horizon, effective treatments still extremely valuable. Vaccines projected decent, amazing effectiveness, take years fully produce distribute. even still, may old immunocompromised get vaccine. No. saying save millions without coverups, misleading lying people. Taiwan South Korea excellent examples low deaths keep strong economy without lies. cases estimated much higher confirmed. murica hide pandemic, desperate people crush doors hospitals. left unattended, growth exponential, US March good example, India another.


So news fake including ones western reporters?  ourselves. Covid kill people, Infact average age health people mean relatively actually dying it.

No they're dying price food gone 20-50% places already spending 80% income food.

200K people US 1M globally?

An additional 10M going die writing report year far it'll likely higher. Trump appointee, surprise I'll bet 15,000 IUs vitamin D3 every day work much better, cost much less, much available, fewer negative side effects lots lots positive side effects. easily tell party affiliation someone claiming back November...   I‚Äôm confused cure find recently? could said current administration.  Also weak dead stronk survive!!! know still exercise religion. still assemble. still free speech freedom press still redress grievances...but need wear masks follow social distancing rules. yeah, nothing violated here. Also Jacobson vs Massachusetts would like word. mean honest, India, one masks. Especially working class/poverty. simply know magnitude risk, can't afford Masks sanitization. higher chance immunity issues poor household structures. keep going up. someone Germany (where everyone masks shops public transport), Denmark recently, shocked see one wearing masks supermarkets, shops, restrooms. could buy masks supermarket, one wearing. Friendly reminder 2020 flu shot already available. terrible idea get one year, think Walgreens already giving out. Probably different parts UK would that, almost nice experience here, everyone nice long get close other. Different towns different experiences right? 

As Spain, Italy others - honestly can't say there, friends huge problems fair. one know hungarians thought worse could even go hairdressers... :D 

I think always going remain subjective. important thing wear mask inside, outside - problems sun. People mediterranean countries majority latin america going problems get enough vit year long. Deficiencies happen UK scandinavia etc. 

And TBH UK people already getting extra vitamin D, NHS whole online section north. Nothing new really, upped dose done :)

So literally nothing happened masks (no sun inside buildings) lockdowns. mean 90% time get enough sun either way Manchester :D   I'll take look it, hopefully afford it.

Thank much Fucking New Jersey. bunch extended family they've bitching masks lock since February. went quiet months found later least 6 caught COVID.

From title: ""Breakdown Federal aid per COVID-19 Case""

In words, giving ""(Dollars Federal Aid) divided (Number Cases)"" state.

Alabama Arkansas received less aid, many fewer cases, divide get bigger number.

Making really clear (and using made up, small numbers) state receives $100 100 cases, get $1/case. state B receives $20 2 cases, get $10/case. State received 5 times much money state B, received 1/10th much money per case State B. heard IMF? Incorrect. on-campus, student housing properties, town university limited 10 people gathering time whether indoor outdoor, masks required indoors outdoors. caught party 10 people, get fined. mask on, that's another fine. tested positive COVID tested negative, that's another fine (this info collected university made available campus PD). fall three criteria lease on-campus property hosting event, that's four fines, that's what's enforced town, count university fine based fact that, attending school, agree code conduct, willingly broke it. measures established supported local government conjunction university, based state government guidelines ""warning zone"" communities like (have positivity rate 8% three consecutive days), enforced campus PD help designated compliance officers.

Going guess individuals family work closely people sign numerous death certificates don‚Äôt understand that.

So fraud death certificates? talking butts one? read something back said typical two adult two kid household someone sick 27 weeks year. Bravo  Absurd. probably halfway wealthy nation. Even cautious scientists begun predict life back normal Western countries roughly middle next year. Many others predicting something ""approaching"" normal early 2021. absolutely ""just getting started"". remains seen whether worst ahead us behind us, either way going like much longer.

Nope, larger planes three classes. There's quite differences first business class actually: airlines, first-class passengers might seat turns bed even private apartment, whereas business class might offer leg room, private space.

Internationally, four cabins plane, although might get First, Business, Economy (typically Middle Eastern airlines), Business, Premium, Economy (standard US Europe), Business Economy. Different airlines different standards, basically, flying long-haul internationally (at least service restricted due Covid):

First - Flat beds guaranteed. Private doors likely. Possibly even double bed. Seat turns large single bed minimum. Super premium bedding individually prepared food, generally time flight. $100 bottle Champagne+ similar liquor. Private security luxurious lounge ground.

Business - low-cost airlines maybe small planes long routes (Air Canada Rouge?) - flat beds expected. Private doors possible. Double beds unlikely - certainly require two seats couple. Premium bedding nicer food, served plates much individual preparation. Food mostly served set times. $30 Champagnes liquors. Premium security lounge access ground.

Premium economy - get seat, bed, wider, legroom, reclines bit economy. Much less likely get middle seat. Nicer food minimal preparation. Sparkling wine lucky. Liquors business class. Low cost airlines (e.g., Norwegian, Scoot) may sell something like business. Generally lounge access.

Economy - get seat. smaller 5'8"", probably comfortable long trying sleep. Middle seats abound (1 3?) Food probably included, low-cost airlines. may pay alcohol good stuff. mean valid.

Some operatos already made call visitors ban necessary though, like two operators private sector (March 11): noting article private actors proactive closing early protocols place covid-19 infected.

I‚Äôm honestly confused you‚Äôre here. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* bailouts industry refuses put safety profits, wish specifically bad? punishment appropriately fits crime. Wearing masks saves lives, help society perform work results disobeying laws place protect people. bonus, forces spend time thinking ramifications actions. grave digging may someone could saved everyone wore masks public. Again, opinions justification violently robbing people. state exist, justification people make tyrannical institutions existence creepy. US seems permenantly behind  Absolutely ridiculous gets downvoted. Everything keep Sverigebilden (image Sweden) right? look states opened willy-nilly see pattern: big increase daily new cases starts May, peak mid late July, followed nearly symmetrical decrease. Reported deaths follow pattern, delayed and, course, little chaotic due way deaths reported.

I've posting month now, whatever reason sub particularly receptive good news. think there's lot denial going on. 

It appears though herd immunity effects kick much lower community infection threshold previously predicted. looks though might need around 20% infection rate rather 60 80% told back March. 

Keep mind southern states seeing infection rates start drop overall cumulative infection rate 6 10%. 

Those people trying use COVID drive Trump office probably going disappointed. November, declines continue, southern states going lockdown infection rates. 

People northern states, they're still locked down, going pretty pissed off. 

Just prediction. endorsement, mind you.  RemindMe! 11 months got Ranger, someone fumbles around multiple languages, think OP solid would appreciated myself. I‚Äôm think half country categorizes Antichrist. Slam!    Keep mind positive developments (but might see results years).

Covid 19 much measles century positive developments like make future Covid-19 manageable. water (ice) discovered Mars. calm down. k. Go watch state sponsored TV coke lie down. Brandeis lets lock contageous sickness doesnt exist anymore! Can't wait someone say minority deaths matter, like old sick people deaths. I'm suspecting llamas may soon go extinct forced. governors following CDC guidelines nursing homes didn't, even refusing allow workers [to wear cases. 

Had governors moved elsewhere, useless naysayers right wing would pivoted to: ""The fascist governors forcibly removed sick elderly legal residences!"" words, zero credibility feel important point whenever folks pop undeservedly claim moral high ground. Donkey! mostly fit issue. Ear straps work people better others. head straps generally allow secure fit, especially moving around. 3M N90s ear straps fit fairly well fit wife well compared FFP3 masks have. Okay, society altered society crumbling. change due unforeseen circumstances dealing right now, likely going temporary change. 

Food pantries would available society crumbling. Losing business losing job, society crumbling. Moving back parents society crumbling. 

I realize things affect us personally close us seem like world gone hell. case though. Society crumbling, may working would want to, safety nets would hope expect civilized society unhelpful, way always setup. Maybe things need change respect. explain  Yeah... antibody report mid May, know majority Covid positive people blood antibody test show negative.

The actual number could several times higher.

The number June 13%. Pretty much proof detectable antibodies fade pretty quickly. video day old. 3000 today. 2621 exact. I'm honestly sure serious ironic. I‚Äôm guessing percentage unevenly distributed among classes. Upper classes able provide private tutors/homeschooling compensate lower classes not. Thus, lower class children fall behind education, causing future earnings shrink even would upper class children. earth revolve around U.S &amp; lot U.S lagging Europe. New York better example closer European trend &amp; deaths risen much like Sweden, France, Italy, U.K. 

In fact seen single place dramatic rise deaths except places shut early never really first wave. University Arizona said students shelter place stop covid outbreak there. feel like may lot cases among college-age population severely undercounted. mean quite obviously lots people care evidenced popularity bars ‚Äî makes life tick may you, that‚Äôs ok, certainly survive without care.

Now perhaps dismiss people work bar getting poor excuse unemployment days along ever changing prognosis might work again... may may want open certainly care. Sure didn‚Äôt make assumptions say anything herd immunity post. said cases dramatically fallen see data. wouldn‚Äôt assume it‚Äôs herd immunity, would assume people area slow spread down. it‚Äôs spreading slower now, doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs herd immunity it‚Äôs spreading all. still phenomenon quickly numbers drop interesting see kicking they're US lot capacity make melt-blown fabric raw material, kind thing change even 10 months tried soon enough (which obviously didn't). countries make lot want give us - that's world works, unicorns not. Gee, would nice president wreck global supply chain cause feels like it. Nobody said average Israeli looks like. Israelis look like though, I‚Äôm sure issue stock photos. 'Working together' would actually *talking* neighbours come agreement, immediately calling cops. contributes mistrust destruction community spirit oof, another smooth-brained cult member friend said got December. scenario kids school rest school year. Cases rise fall.

My district sending hybrid traditional kids back end month. Done hybrid parents g0frsking think soon, traditional ones declaring happy finally send kids back deal distance learning.

Conservative estimates cases slime October November, suspect schools shut month two then.

As much hate bring virtual year, happy dealing yoyoing.

Do great grandparents want kid school? way segregate parents kids? want exposed? process engineers, research chemists, etc. currently working Covid vaccine could hired onto project. Workers adjacent fields might also able help additional training, they'll time problem persists 2024 (unlikely seems).

We need willing spend money, stop freaking idea paying manufacturing companies manufacturing. smart someone dumb see clearly majority U.S. still dealing covid 19 next 9 10 years right probably means 40% plus it.

If rough guide number infected (dead times mortality) cone least 20% mortality 0.3%, better tested European countries IFR 0.16%. could easily high 40%.

We need stop trusting blood seroprevalence studies end all. lot people develop discernable blood antibodies all, lot fall non detectable levels couple months. example, London 17% positive mid May, 10% mid June.

When compare saliva antibodies blood high five times higher blood antibodies.

What seen one area hit 43% (joint antibody tests) epidemic dropped right off. herd immunity would lower expected. area also IFR 0.25%. Yea call Bullshit. Still going happen still happen. fucking stand shoulder shoulder protest trick treat Trump pumping tons fake news? ironic dunno you, children much better remote learning. confused subject get 1 1 help completely understand it. Obviously household lucky enough able offer instruction time needed fill gaps. Many arent offered opportunity. stop. based knowledge time brand new diesease knew nothing about. Brazil exactly third world. serious academic qualifies such. according Redditors, fucking important enough break beloved lockdown, going work not? Getting education not? Y‚Äôall priorities wrong place. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)&lt;==========8 make assumptions though. great cases dramatically dropping, infer level substantial immunity. would need data seroprevalence surveys find out. places like Maricopa County areas Maricopa County may like New York. areas New York City reached herd immunity, New York northeast general remain vulnerable another outbreak. I'm interested see shapes fall/winter second wave. I'm seeing people relaxing precautions taken citing huge numbers assumed cases summer saying we're close herd immunity worries. 

To seems like huge gamble. we're 15-20% plunge head first seasonal wave (especially relax precautions allow seasonal flu creep back in) could set us disaster. still really know long haulers spring summer encountering various seasonal maladies fall winter.

So far area I'm seeing less masks, lots football athletics, local HS homecoming, invited bridal shower church, lots churches back normal, fall wedding, tons eating out. local university back session full swing they've done 500 tests Aug Sept. SIGNIFICANTLY higher immunity looks toast Jan. swedens overall excess mortality 2015?

?! even trying say there? incoherent sentences make sense all.

And say always similar, ""right many countries relaxed"" started June. Otherwise Germany would concerts football matches attendance again, Copenhagen's night life would opened (and threatened closed bc surge). American school's problem lie closing pandemic, really doesn't. Ur teacher student ratio absurd. Ur public school funding abysmal. surprising  [European Centre Disease Prevention give everyone decent free education like countries could.. worry, we'll hit post Labor Day spike soon enough. partially opened quite different ‚Äúopen everything up‚Äù comment reacting to.

What percentage swedish households singe generation? compare US?


why think achieve Sweden's plan can't lockdown?

are deniers going start wearing masks ask make mandatory? say might also want think extended lockdowns society... Hint: human cost gigantic US context really think comes AFTER

don't hint, make arguments directly. Stop posting bad info. NYC one highest tracing success rates country threatens subpoenas fail comply, massive testing operation anyone get tested whenever want, addition closed restaurants, mobility trends still far normal, widespread mask use. NYC hit tradition HIT Rt would continued decelerate not. hovering little 1 slow reopenings. state RT one currently rising things slowly CDC power use Defense Production Act. I‚Äôm sure telling people reuse masks best option executive charge willing needs done. Nah, end corona virus restrictions create walking dead people need use beds. absolute least, Trump foundation fraud absolutely illegal, Stormy Daniels NDA. Donald would like advise dont know difference try see either cure Covid. meant parents kid take heat, ie kid needs know one hold responsible parents decision.

Because 100 percent gets anyone household sick, blame herself. Kids blame even took part causation. knows class gets quarantined one getting sick, loved ones get sick, blame herself. rural Wisconsin? Nah. thought really stretch. 

When close relative died end February what's listed pneumonia like symptoms worried attending funeral (a mere week emergency declared). 

If said true there'd deaths home elderly visited it. nope. One non-lethal case there. none funeral people sat side along nurses, none took precautions.  nobody looked overlay U.S. cases deaths? exactly looked like cases exploded south people started dying 1-2 months later. think way much faith court system ever rule business owner 7 billion people going get though...  comment reminds although attitude U.S. we're #1 everything, nice know hold patent selfishness stupidity. need hear dumb dumbs around world happens everywhere USA. Rapidly. CEO world‚Äôs largest vaccine manufacturer estimated world need around 15 billion doses Covid-19 shot two-dose vaccine

big true realize work goes ""unskilled"" labor right? hire engineers work line factory. hire design car. ""what mean ready, Dr. called in"" ""I'm paying $20 copay insurance $15""

I would like: ""oh, ok...let get manager you."" deal shit get pay for! Sure, things ""they"" make responsibility....but dealing shitty customer probably manager's task deal with. can‚Äôt beat ‚Äòem, join em!

How utterly pathetic. sacrifice daughter's safety cries sometimes feeling peer pressure. News flash, children cry, adults resist peer pressure.

I would ashamed write wrote. basically cases acceptable

That's myth. goal prevent spike cases, means keeping curve flat. 

""Flatten curve"" never meant bringing hospital usage giving up. obviously hospital beds ventilators must used!

Well, yes. Flatten curve level enough PPE medical room handle it. used one year, 4 5 year average pretty standard?

anyway, Sweden last week recorded excess mortality compared average past five years first time since COVID-19 struck country whose death toll pandemic eclipsed neighbours, statistics showed data Statistics Sweden showed country registered 1,524 deaths last week, slightly lower average 2015‚Äì2019, 1,569 first week since corona outbreak happened,‚Äù Statistics Sweden said statement, adding deaths might still revised show slight excess reuters full shit cherry picking fuck data. assuming thing said even true 2015 Whoa there. Petty insults explaination exactly people donate india. No, pretty sure it‚Äôs known there‚Äôs truth it, it‚Äôs super significant exact mechanism isn‚Äôt known sure. IIRC something proposed type less susceptible clotting issues associated severe COVID symptoms. sick time testing available match main symptoms, would make someone idiot believe covid? can't get raw ingredients make masks easily 

It's 10 months later. Unless machine requires something living unicorn, produced masse long time.  It‚Äôs technically lockdown state, intents purposes life lockdown, partly self imposed consider common sense reasons, partly lot things still open. workplace currently reduced capacity asked come back yet, community college still online. Hey man mean Death rates go young people spread older ones. U.S. June again. utterly bizarre people ignorant history literally happened 2 months ago. bullshit. knew something would save lives tells people opposite?? That's inexcusable. 

His excuse hold weight either: need save masks first responders?? huge mask shortage anyway. 

But importantly, logistics field. Force Trump invoke Defense Production Act.  Either way, job tell people epidemiological issues, nothing more. failed masks.

That's almost bad everything people saying Trump Woodward issue.  *patriotic choking noises* subreddit typically fair job cutting politics hearsay, tries delivers actual cold hard facts COVID-19 peripheral, related issues.

I believe appropriate place sort misinformation, unsupported theories, (in case) complete guesswork. 

I could totally wrong large amount downvotes received kind say community large doesn‚Äôt really agree side things. 

At point don‚Äôt see anything gained continuing discussion, great day. sounds great, prove it. sad management stand behind employees. 

""No mask, service, exceptions"" easy rule private business. Employees backed enforce it, expected enforce it, way they'd enforce customers covering genitals visit salad bar. 

I worked retail. asked people leave refused serve abusive. boss backed every time. Horror stories get attention people decent, give misleading impression norm. ignorant. ignorant.  vague anecdotal generalizations clearly outweigh weight data. contact tracing Well, india neither less ask favours though? vaccine pandemic mighty leverage tool. country hand leverage without getting something return. hugely negligent. stopped ""emergency"" long time ago PA likely due restrictions put place were. continues ""emergency"" restrictions still place. need place indefinitely people actively ignoring common sense restrictions prolonging everyone. 

I live fairly pro-virus part PA, people screaming masks bridge far, breath bitching restrictions following first place need realize they're problem, they're we're still this, they're reasons need restrictions first place. Like 90% bars outdoor patios seating 90% open. Everyone keeps saying 'open up' honestly shit exactly pre covid except wear mask more. might left system already. think antibodies body months, could wrong Hcq? /S sent link CDC saying ""contact tracing works."" OK, that's very, general. think played NYC. live here, reality contact tracer someone calling week got sick. then? probably already hanging home. preventing getting sick. people going meet anyway? 

If know, started contact tracing thing mid-late May, coincidentally, protests started also case #s nosedived. Ever since I've hearing every concert, bar, street party, church gathering, name it, going cause spike, never comes.

But one pretending contact tracing much. Maybe need go r/nyc read people actually spoke contact tracers. ""Why calling 2 weeks later?"" ""none friends said actually called them"" common themes.

Stop trying defend system reading online, especially ""information"" vague also calling supposedly vague. That‚Äôs true PCR testing, antibody tests likely result higher % false positives (mostly true positive still pretty low) know what, totally forgot story. could be! cannot wait competent man/woman back White House...Trump wants build legacy, he's going get exactly that. legacy absolute WORST president time. self-righteousness spreading, maybe order shit online, still equals people forced risk spread virus often inessential consumerism, unlikely consider completely removed end.

Reduction better nothing. fewer people spreading virus, better. Spoiler: C &amp; D. also recommends adequate sleep exercise. Florida definitely surge, cases started surging June reopening deaths starting surging July.

But, aside maybe places around Miami-Dade area, hospitals overwhelmed anything. know stopped elective surgeries not, time heard hospital worries Miami-Dade.

And numbers dropping now. think Florida put anything place increase restrictions, seem opening schools bars numbers dropping. Sunday, report is:

* \+970 cases: 56424 reported.
* \+141 recovered: 21069 reported.
* \+16 deaths: 606 reported.
* 589 hospitalized.
  * 237 ICU. LOL ""un-teaching"" thank one. wife currently enrolled masters degree program enrolled college well free time. Obviously everyone background help. definitely believe parents un-learning children. Figured id leave one too! Political parties way concerned scoring points. want feel great ones rebuilding fixing america making America better. want able say ""we better party. good them. messiahs actually fix america trash idiots think solve problems"". They're concerned rather coming effective ways save lives. may give us idea expect coronaviruses humans including new .

Asymptomatic cases still kryptonite. keep ignoring oath Fauci admitted **he tell truth** masks non-epidemiological reasons.

EDIT: article even mention asymptomatic carriers not. face it: Fauci deceived public this. He's fine part. fucked admit it. Dude, English probably mothertongue guy wrote Sweden stricter restrictions SINCE summer many countries, that! Norway, Denmark, Germany opened June, Sweden kept restrictions April. 

Whatever, Excess Mortality comparison shows anyway confused topic. Rather daily cases number tracking case load total active cases. asking governors agree ‚Äúactive‚Äù means. though. can‚Äôt lock two years. I‚Äôve locked 6 months didn‚Äôt change shit. 9 month mark done. one else going help us fuck it! know I‚Äôm one. comes time can‚Äôt forever fuck would sub like news? anything shows states, particularly south, got collective heads asses, started implementing semblance public health guidelines seeing positive results.

If anything, they're happy give kind classification: means understanding operate incorrect. use advantage.

If understanding operate incorrect, properly see saying? 

If can't that, know kinds decisions make, perspectives adopt, best interest?

The media _general_ taken critical assessment, regardless personally view opine subject matter, regardless distributes it.

Sure, I'd consider CNN worth paying attention FOX News, think CNN bought paid agenda well fucking naive.

If focused less **what want** individually **what actually true possible**, irrespective personal interests opinions, we'll actually chance coming shithole.

And ultimately selfish perspectives (not desires, perspectives) reason this. never said COVID ""would kill ONE US."" 

Either misremembering, misleading flat lying. literally happened today. friend i've known since children told 1 paper piece evidence says masks help sent 5 sent graphs test results day indicated masks mandates set regional data set showed graph increasing mask mandates, implying correlation. spent 30 minutes explaining errors logic/critical thinking kept saying ""you provide information provide mine,"" analysis side valid fact flawed going say ""apples apples"" make sure items apples drawing apple. dunning kruger effect real life. also think people taht never really educated, went school going motions, actually critical thinking skills make connections assume related beacuse found facts visualizations support initial ""gut instinct"" proudly strut around that's that's required form educated opinion. taht's think hold ""facts"" ""evidence"" aspect without actually looking nything provide, emotionally attached much mor trust numbers even though educated, feel data literally educated taht's that's required children even trials = getting vaccinated anytime soon, dont spread bullshit order.

You mention Belgium. Look hospitalisation curve death curve compared ""cases"". Spain, UK, Netherlands, Sweden, Portugal.

There list still first wave (Ukraine, Romania), none second wave based Outcomes.  conspiracy theory. Pure bullshit. Sensitivity necessary pick presymptomatics. Feel free read works spreading bullshit misinformation. Lots people died U.S. south spite supposed ""casedemic."".

If people worried.. stay away me.

You extrapolate way around.
If get 1/10th number hospital, means 10x number cases per day peak first wave (100k) Well cases never flattened kept increasing testing, well test enough start many testing kits plus infrastructure help either.

But worry people Max chilled nothing happened (laughs nervously)

Although one advantage 30% population lives urban areas less 10% around big cities, transmission rate low towns density low. city living got almost 15% population tested received rapid testing kits orders daily almost 0.5% population getting tested. 2 months think control atleast Big cities.

I accept actual science referenced. stated march may factor found, mean convert case counts.

Also, scientists used seroprevalence surveys, agree correct way measure immunity.

none found 20 percent immunity nationwide. really good point realize high numbers checked today. popualr countries talk seen sub news outlets are: US, Brazil, UK, Italy, France, Spain. really shows Euro-centric world is. Latin America getting hit hard getting proportional news coverage.  Generally no, fly medical teams across country reinforce region whenever there's outbreak.

Also pool testing. Dalian example pools 5 people each. places like Melbourne example also lockdown Australia limits number people coming yet numbers still higher China everyone seems moving freely wish small number cases reported imported. make sense head guess I'm missing something. Yes, that's true; also heard morning; fine civil penalty. charge may result additional penalties including 3 years prison. Yes, right would better links various studies. takes get in. research page I'll add to, 'FAQ' pages linked references.

What refer particle size. mentioned talks, culturing aerosols hard -- general trend though larger micron infective less evaporated. 

The particle size distributions show small portion 1 micron. thing 1 viral particle probably infect you. need many copies, though know exact quantity.

Getting lower quantities helps matter even infected, lower dose means lower severity. Also, saw headline today saying small amount viruses make through/around masks may gradually building immunity.

Yet, potential good news. maybe able go business usual soon, bad idea rush denial. option nurse reuse n95s, I'm taking d3, magnesium, zinc.

Because odds even though careful take precautions... I'll still get :/ ""I DONT THINK SCIENCE KNOWS"" - Trump 2000 IQ Man, know works months would great works.

Infection decreasing Sweden, increasing neighbouring countries. Everything what's happening direct moment, end result. Daily deaths seem differ much compared Denmark, Denmark seems getting intensive care patients right now. statistics title 4 days. assume trolling. weird reason, regularly seem people claim Denmark wants herd immunity. IDK lol.

But anyway answer.

DK police also started closing doors parties. weekend.

For sure restriction tightened private parties, necessary.

The masks always help getting % bit down, even though obviously spread take bars. also helps psychologically, make hard forget corona.

The public transports regulations mask wearing working - least got cases √Örhus Odense.

Obviously, wearing masks transportation nothing spread happens places. Nobody really expected stop spread bars people places ae wearing masks :)

Last least, control. lockdown 500 plus hospital. Today 55 hospitals, 3 intensive. 
 
So long ""out control"" many restrictions left tool kit, going happen. They're talking actual cases, confirmed. can't share image here, view report go page 11, see bar chart describing age distribution ICU patients time.

Red March/April, blue May/June green July/August. Y-axis percentage ICU admissions time period. X-axis age group.

You indeed see lower age groups getting represented ICU admissions. However, seem high age groups getting higher percentage well. Also, noteworthy sample size March/April 2662 admissions total, vs 124 July/August. Yeah absolutely ridiculous response. parent commentator asked reasonable question response still fails answer question throws shade well.

Your normal person went 1% .2%. saves 1 100 per day. Nice small change. doctors number goes 50% 10%. saves 40 doctors per 100. That's huge.

I'm rural area we've like 40 cases Covid area they've got stop spreading small outbreak. nobody died around lot people think big deal.

High school sports going problem here. dad took grandpa football game last week outdoors people recommended wear masks. Well, dad got said see single mask, bleachers completely full, people lining street nearby watch. goddamn junior high football game. dad grandpa thankfully stayed pickup watched end zone parking, surprised bunch cases popping soon. newspaper week saw there's small article says 'Covid cases risen', even say many now.

I guess fuck it, I'm moving couple days even rural area probably around people holidays, worry parents, sisters, cousins teachers, they're trying hard follow new regulations done good job keeping virus schools, dumb fuck parents going football games going reason schools getting shut happens.

It drives nuts Midwest states highest % infection rate per 100,000 people, lowest testing. since population low looks like we're better states like CA TX, reality we're bad probably seen worst yet since people still think virus overblown. rely job pay pay mortgage without it? top fact finding job right really difficult.

I can't imagine like optimistic fools thought quarantine would last week's months. lot people know started break rules mismatch expectations. Sort 'fuck it' approach since nobody anything anyway So... sounds interesting, potentially life saving. doubt anything like researched tested time useful Covid-19.

Eh, idea vaccine mutate leading candidates pan (although they're really promising).

Agreed thought looks good - obvious caveats mouse/hamster. Need NHP please. Longer normal time period.  risk death children covid astronomically low. 18 states zero minors died covid-19. 1. cases COVID primary cause death included official count. I's COVID specific, rather common way deaths attributed Russia (and post-Soviet countries, believe) - cause death specifically caused body cease functioning, things listed important concomitant conditions death certificate.
2. Inclusion official COVID deaths statistics requires autopsy postmortem postmortem test, cause significant lag (up 45 days cases). Rosstat (the national statistics agency) since April includes COVID deaths estimates monthly natural population movement (births, deaths, marriages, divorces) reports based preliminary death certificates (those reports freely avilable Rosstat's official site everybody desiring). period April July (August data published early October) count:

* 17964 deaths COVID primary cause death confirmed PCR testing
* 4626 COVID suspected primary cause death confirmed PCR (the clinical picture matches guess).
* 4719 COVID main cause death significantly affected preexisting conditions eventually led lethal outcome.
* 10599 COVID neither main cause contributed.

So, see numbers hidden. can't claim numbers manipulated, certainly manipulated degree people sub like imagine. Nah feel you. way people argue perceive bad faith.

They've started check reinfection apparently. mention anecdotal cases even looked. 

A cold example (also coronavirus) unlike flu, passed around family back person carrying original infection. flu generally changes slow enough can't reinfected way.

Herd immunity usually applicable things like polio measles.... infection generally recognizable body infection. 

Although read cross immunity might exist China COV 1 helped severe. (But mean get it) Clinton seems like loser bunch time hands mean super spreader bowl germs? everyone person classes? mildly sick weird symptoms like cough loss taste March. Didn‚Äôt think much came back positive antibodies. 

Anyone else tested positive antibodies knows people did? haven‚Äôt sure much trust test. 

I friend insists got Hong Kong December lol. Cases positivity rate decreasing I'm surprised. Wearing masks attempt control amount viral load seems dangerous statement make without backing details. 

Which masks apply for? context? logic get similar positive effect wearing masks making sure maintain 2m distance? Hell, without specifics say best approach isnt distance wear masks outside elderly care bring immunity rest population quick possible short time. 

There many conclusions people take based statement like always thought porch light on. Isnt norm normal flu aswell? Somebody former workplace fell unconscious ground week flu adamant work. So, go human trials soon market? Hardware stores seems worst. Although lately feel like better. pisses see people openly defying mask order employees letting go. Yes, take risks strictly necessary.

Pretty much every scientist expert wrong point throughout whole ordeal including Dr Fauci. wrong past doesn‚Äôt mean everything ever say zero credibility virus one ever dealt before. Sweden country right. audiobook great. movie underwhelming. I'm sure can't say 10% malicious dont know badly masks we're 95% efficiency threshold. never financially recover this. get I'm good grew Christian household. zealots true Christ like thoughts actions. grew away organized religion various reasons respect mother's beliefs, etc.

Then there's Aite still arent inheriting debt. am, people literally nothing curb virus, they‚Äôre living like nothing going virus. usually mean certain type cancer entire thing itself. function different way treatments. clickbaity say cancer instead certain kind cancer.  did, seen way worse science fiction. social economic upheaval experiencing point dissipate.

Yes current issues big issues. Yes unrest definitely worst far century, solely due covid. like gentle tickle balls. also shows value life US, 3k$. Exactly point. I'm sure kid, given option adult self, would rather distance ed possibility losing parents (s) (quite real especially high risk, husband both). trauma would definitely set back! would trauma knowing favorite teacher died. (With kids, current teacher always favorite!) ü§£ Really? That‚Äôs interesting.

Could provide source please? trouble finding one myself. said, precedent events Denmark proved, really doubt idea came mind epidemologist healthcare expert, rather politician worried popularity.

I also would curious see proportion people get infected eating out. Something ""irrelevant"" ""nothing all"". [US] got tested positive told doctor 13d instead 14d. Heh. We‚Äôll take anyone else wants hellride US. they‚Äôll follow laws, act consideration courtesy everyone, wear fucking masks, they‚Äôre welcome.

You however stay are. Many colleges struggling stay afloat financially even happened lot are, lot need people care them. care givers go out. Keeping safe insanely hard virus pretty much everywhere. ESH Meat prices surged significantly anyways. registry antivaxxers doses sent wrong place ? That's criminal. governor allow it?  greatest country ever, great country. family close (no extended family state really know anyways) friends. daughter's friends back school I'm allowing around time that. may change weeks progress, I'm certain will. positive case high school school even closed... 



I agree idea ""adapt overcome"" right now, regarding people, adapting keeping clear notice. plenty bowls right size crappy enough I'd leave sitting outside.

If nothing else, still paying (even mostly time) wash bowl. unneeded use. medical field iterative. There's one-and-done. breakthroughs every day almost every field, cancer wide-ranging complicated thing rather ignorant think singular topic ""cured"" point. going gym since end June, cases gym yet (they said they'd notify us take will). Masks required, 20 people allowed time, must sign waver ever time saying symptoms contact someone covid positive take temperature enter. Sunday Fining people voluntarily meeting up? Yikes. Clint? think goes even deeper that. Every type skin cancer different. Every type leukemia different. types big deal. types kill you.

When dad diagnosed prostate cancer, lifetime odds dying prostate cancer actually went down. mild form radiotherapy treats actually reduced risk getting aggressive type later. Meanwhile people get prostate cancer game over. month Chicago, basically.  Every nation's head realize top social apex. terms sheer amount ways corona could reach them. 

If contain corona wear n95 urself, u get it. Every nation's head realize top social apex. terms sheer amount ways corona could reach them. 

If contain corona wear n95 urself, u get it.  $3000 death hell kind fine that.

There needs corporate execution via fines people die practices company. keep pedantic speech passive agressiveness yourself, thank you. expected, goalposts moved issue people wearing masks every single minute day breathing. Meanwhile, would expect wearing masks sometimes would better never wearing one. way, concerned responsible citizen are, wearing mask every possible occasion? saying issue.

I hope big, fantastic, enormous brain work one out. future American leadership ? meant treatment comes 2027 virus coming fall like weeks away something Except many treatments various forms cancer seeing wide usage today. example, [the fatality rate Cancer whole dropped 27% 25 really narrow-minded black white thinking assume ""cancer"" singular thing ""cured"" all. Almost nothing medical field simple. field medicine, like technology, iterative evolves thousands incremental breakthroughs compound time.

This kind thinking people become anti-vaccination. Ie, referencing long vaccines took 1950's evidence rapidly developed vaccine 2020 ""isn't safe"".

Come people, medical field advanced slightly since 1950. topic Covid US. rate diseases countries absolutely nothing matter hand.
 
If want compare diseases Covid US, you‚Äôll need use US numbers want actually argument.
 
If that, we‚Äôd see Covid substantially prevalent deadly TB. Exactly. Nothing would happen went out. places (like live) noncompliant businesses ‚Äúpunished‚Äù fines people never intend pay.

In Italy lot countries actually stopped people going town town, leaving homes, issuing fines nonessential travel. socially distanced (i.e. almost empty) require masks nowadays. Singing etc. irrelevant post-lockdown, alot even going now.

Ok, study conducted June. Maybe churches people going almost empty then. one subjects study though can't help explain confused confused by. 

Not confused - actually trying help understand article trouble people crowding sorts places churches/synagogues places consistently labelled ""hot spots"" house parties, public transport, stores, restaurants, library, doctor's office, job.

This kind strawman argument unless show source someone actually said churches hot spots worry places. Personally, back work since March, know publications talking said places except places worship good really think true sitting church 16X dangerous afortmentioned places? mean, 16X huge difference. even saying double ""more likely.""

Again, say church 16x dangerous places. said people study went church three times two weeks 16x likely test positive. want draw conclusion that, would went church 3 times two weeks, 16x likely get COVID went church less that. they're saying going church pandemic dangerous going church pandemic. honestly, that's super surprising me. 

It mean ""church 16X dangerous afortmentioned places."" fact, conclusion study 4x dangerous public transit. study places talking about.

Also, really matter came shocking conclusion. make up. interviewed thousand people, math people tested positive, found data strong correlation gone church testing positive. 

Should published findings math said something scary? really know call study ""garbage"" wish math shown something different Why? 3 kids age group getting straight far year. sit sometimes always check work immediately see picking something. far, good.

I hear saying learning disabilities, know home school ideal beats parents. Still, really sucks kids might fall cracks. also worry kids getting left home unsupervised, course reliable internet. 

Not school send them? always case? wake up, remind brush hair teeth, feed breakfast, drive school, will? Kindergartners usually wake up, get ready without prompting drive school. High school? Different story.

It's infuriating stop think we'd cooperated first place, nightmare, well, nightmare! wrong. thought involved photosynthesis, considered reactive.  wrong. thought involved photosynthesis, considered reactive. since March. early reports high doses vit C(10,000mg/day) good treatment moderate cases, reports linking vit deficiency serious cases pretty well established. became culture war thing, everything else has. Imagine going back 2010 telling someone things like Star Wars pandemic response would blue tribe/red tribe temper tantrum. They'd laugh face. I've read hypothesis makes sense. like quick trip store (grab shit get LoL) safer meandering. 

Plus whole... mask... big deal? 

This pandemic shown common sense critical thinking left building. hate people say this. takes time things discovered, go rigorous trials, reach actual distribution stage. Well really game cause shit outdated fuck hahaha, people get hang with.  COVID-19 seasonal (not yet anyway). persistent.

I said nothing seasonality, sure lead-in Certainly coronavirus vaccine shorter time frame effectiveness say flu vaccine.

Why? Source? Flu mutates rather rapidly, every year shotgun new vaccines, whereas Coronavirus mutates much resources suggest useful timeline immunity vaccination?

Pfizer, Moderna, et al published scientific data Phase II trials, Rhesus monkey trials, etc indicate good immunity antibody levels beyond fought COVID. Given people fought COVID still getting re-infected 9+ months later, data indicates likely get year vaccine, much COVID-19 like measles polio. therapeutic much helpful time. IMO

But why? Therapeutics always helpful, vaccines always provided bulk protection available, therapeutics helping cleaning vaccine can't address. That's win US then.

California also shutdown much bigger portion society.... monstrous costs (human economic) magically waved compare CA Texas, Florida Georgia.

Funny, omitted Arizona: along curve cases deaths California's

By appearances Texas new cases/deaths (per capita) also soon drop California'.. And, 2-3 months shutdown, California _total_ deaths catch up. Meanwhile damage keep accumulating

***I'm coming you. NEVER FIND PEACE! N E V E R !***

I mean uh..

don't speak england well sorry good time people China wear masks  ""sparsely filled"" probably means 50% capacity reduction. means empty seat two seats. 

That's hardly 3 ft separation. masks? mean, singing cheering yelling crowd masks keeping distance? that's realistic

Even one cheered team, imagine entrances exits , people usually gets compressed almost 4 people per square meter. Divide half get even close safe margins

Don't trust me, learn past experiences happened binding totally separate things together. know Chinese government better you, that‚Äôs part *response pandemic*.

Chinese style response includes mass testing, contact tracing, mandatory mask, quarantine, lockdown. measures like ones keep saying response pandemic. response dissidents. think finally approaching new norm America time being. spike places happened. way seee dramatic rise able get multiple times. find couple months would say. Otherwise it‚Äôs going constant thing.  mean choices agree scientists agree group corrupt politicians people think seeing meme facebook equal college degree. choice easy. Europe rich, got best best India. people actively taking part this, despite health concerns, actively make sure costumes nothing obstructing kids faces. Might quite extreme disparity percentages, think right general. Even 20% immune, mean shoot people keeping guard six months let slip. true much lower baseline right (Fauci would like 10k/day).

That said, I'm sick approach taken lot media. got right wing media pretending whole crisis rearview mirror, obviously flat retarded we've still got ~800 people dying every day millions people still work. left wing media disingenuous well, harder spot. 

Look qualify drop cases also mentioning decrease good news: 24 states, number new coronavirus cases decreased past week compared previous week. Now, bad news: many states, testing also Sunday, 34,450 new cases reported nationwide, according data Johns Hopkins University. That's better summer peak late July, US 60,000 new cases day. nationwide, testing 10% past week compared previous week

It's wrong point decline testing bad thing, every time mention case decrease, immediately follow talking testing decrease. reality, fail mention, cases roughly 50% July peak, testing declined 10-15% period time. Percent positive also barely half then.

But OK, look past that. can't look past casually slip hope April ... 22,000 cases day thought, 'My God, can't get worse.' what's happening we're going see kind up-and-down, up-and-down. time goes up, goes little higher. time comes down, come far.""

This disingenuous. fail apply logic, within article itself. come mildly lower test volume mentioned breath we're talking current decline cases, shit April goes without second glance? many tests ""back April"" case count oh much better? LESS HALF MANY TESTS. Get fuck shit. employees especially students consistently correctly follow procedures; many sites inadequate protections think working remotely.

Those taking every precaution infected don‚Äôt.

I believe every profession though. Everything remote possible, curbside/takeaway/delivery employees using full PPE; every non-essential survival business closed government freezing mortgages/rents providing direct payments households.

and course, cannot, wrong 20 percent. See, led that. Unfortunately, conclusions follow evidence. counting deaths pandemic expected, fact China undercounted deaths surprising.

Holy shit makes sense. Trump draining swamp highlighting demonstrating corruption rampant US government, also singling support corrupt evil regime. response pandemic bad highlights short commings american health system, rampant corruption well. also means *Mexico* building wall keep Americans IN.

That's really hilarious irony think it. guess vaccine could hold year, would get shot every year, like flu. also 20 percent americans it.

20 percent NYC's seroprevalence is.

so places hit NYC hard 20 percent. Yeah idk that. There's lot reasons war poverty beyond people dumb. ongoing theory reason effects different races heavily due gene problems vitamin deficiencies. study last week somewhat corroborated theory well. it‚Äôs one things doesn‚Äôt really seem negative to. take precaution anyways. obviously know college campuses then. college towns.

Not everyone kid. really understand virus keeps spreading? never got tested know else could gotten. sick years. mid-March got mild cold symptoms days, sore throat swelling ears. went away fast remained dry cough. extreme coughing fits lasted 4 5 months, would come go day long, symptoms. went away time slow process. people shocked China managed virtually eradicate it? bad stop spreading around world though Ruili population 140k people, take long.

One day spent hospital ICU easily cost (at least U.S.). Thank you, woke middle night made fucking giggle Whatever leads less masks thrown away No, think will. reinfection car arrived again. I'm sure I've seen videos Chinese civilians government massively underreporting stats. [Take pinch really nice information worry everyone symptoms game  india easily stop exporting vaccine. like stopped exporting medical equipment start covid: record, anyone trust india enough rely production vaccine? Sure, uk enough capacity world, produce enough population start. many countries. 

The original post argues dump bunch money india let produce vaccine. I'm saying that's realistic. I'm claiming use another country produce world's need vaccine. Funny enough, literal Chinese propaganda posters thread. goal get cases winter started kind success. nobody knows bad winter be, it‚Äôs predicted awful. probably keep mitigation efforts due winter bring Coronavirus doesn‚Äôt actually spread efficiently fomites (surfaces candy bowl would kinda fall that).

He's got 20 years experience kind thing. Hard get hospital barely step outside Sorry, I‚Äôm incredibly curious, long dog walk? hate trying start anything, genuinely asking :) wtf wrong eyes, yellow hell.  FHM two kinds recommendations: *general advice* *recommendations*. General advice advice compliant rules regulations. Recommendations mandatory law states 1 Everyone shall, attention reasonable precautionary measures, contribute preventing spread infectious diseases.  2 Anyone knows reason suspect carries infectious disease obliged take necessary measures protect others risk infection.

If following recommendations might breaking law. two sides coin: complete control actions citizens control official narrative. 

Just monumental response done complete control citizens, mean anyone copy (like said copy S. Korea). not, Act God, right? like economy.   That‚Äôs actually genius move ever that.

We've also learned immunity COVID real, get second explosion reached 20-30% saturation given area. NYC proves - major second wave despite people becoming relaxed tons activities reopening. know reach 20-30% relax, hospitals never over-stressed again, matter what. Jesus nothing it. cool graph, also include data? otherwise, can't verify true is. date Trump suggesting means phase III clinical trial wasn‚Äôt completed 24 fucking ass Americans! USA- Probably resources excuse performing poorly respect rest developed world. don‚Äôt care one another sick set values made top political food chain there. "" typical sub trust numbers coming developing world. ""

**THIS COMPLETE UTTER HORSESHIT.**

There **HUNDREDS** news report India skewing numbers since July. point type 'is India hiding' google auto complete 'is India hiding corona deaths'

This nothing believing countries developing world.

&amp;#x200B;

Although Bangladeshi member developing countries would suggest PLEASE TRUST NUMBERS FACE VALUE. common sense now.

If easy hide numbers system corrupted quite stupid actually expect nation give correct numbers. Oh fret. Even Indian news channels covering exactly jumbo-fucked are. leave empty bowl out, everyone assume ran out. don‚Äôt waste money candy might even get used r/unethicallifeprotips No, cite researchers, cited popular press.

the first article news story article.

Now, look see seroprevelances found, see study covers March-May many places still ramping testing. actual immunity found ranged 1 7 percent(in NYC).

This turn range higher case count.

There magic conversion factor make case numbers seroprevalance numbers user trying do.

Meanwhile seroprevalence studies support guy's contention 20 percent nationally contention.

we know 20 percent immunity looks like, looks like NYC. would sad. Applebee‚Äôs time square suddenly reason room. Outdoor activities associated big surges new infections.

The fully correct term pit toilet.


They common across country back country areas parks (and forests). Ah, nevermind then. anyway get reliable news vaccine efforts places like Russia, China, UAE? He's one talking 100% infection lmao understand this, helps tp rudimentary understanding global trade.

India wouldn‚Äôt vaccine. would India plants make it. India doesn‚Äôt legal way using vaccine geopolitical leverage. would multinational corporation owns intellectual property, manufactures distributes vaccine.

So what‚Äôs stopping India threatening UK blocking vaccine? International sanctions, ruined business reputation, severely damaged economy. 

And UK capacity manufacture distribute vaccine entire globe.   babies.

As somebody US, I've never even heard thing article also states ‚ÄúThe new estimates result complicated statistical modeling pandemic, models taken divergent approaches, yielding inconsistent estimates. certain community world enough residents immune virus resist second wave.‚Äù think got victim mixed perpetrator accidentally arrested 70 year old man. U gotta specific say ""us"". context makes sound like referring tonthe human race Also Argentina still mostly huge restrictions going outside Well Merica administration certainly give crap own. find hard believe China too.

Having said that? China autocratic ruthless fuck. want shut everything down, it. I'm pretty sure China's citizens bucking government ""their freedoms.""

It's far different mitigation strategy US. Argentina can‚Äôt &amp; wait Santa mall visits (eye roll) Dude lol, literally asked guy explain it, did, asking he's talking it?

Please tell fucking us lol Yeah ADE would devastating. would years quasi shutdown. lab animals post vaccine challenge ADE present animals except hamsters rhesus. pleasantly surprised vaccines trigger ADE. would good learn outcome patients.  Don‚Äôt bother get tested antibodies. tests aren‚Äôt greatest doesn‚Äôt change need do.

Sure it‚Äôs comfort know survived infection, also gives false sense security. __don‚Äôt__ know presence antibodies means you‚Äôre less risk! agree millions go outside months kept away sun, good. Thoughts people lockdown currently Buenos Aires, Melbourne, Costa Rica, Panama, Israel more... R/sino poster Haha, NL, changed official cases map shades orange/red blue/green point april. instantly felt less worried. 2020 still table. face small percent body surface worry absorbing vit d, almost like disingenuous saying know better researchers? I've looked - hoping see something like ""0.8 Œºm lowest infection-capable aerosol particle size"" see something categoric. important makers cloth masks. cloth perform well 0.3 Œºm 0.7 Œºm upward. mean filtration performance linear there, drops particle sizes less 0.8 microns. see anything like respect Covid19? great influenza, mask haters tell irrelevant covid19 isn' influenza even viron size infection mechanism.

Interesting too, Reflowlabs link original work recaps - ***Morawska et al 2009*** mentioned pic there's link. page also mention year study - I'm getting lots people reject pro-mask study references year. means ""full disclosure"" list otherwise get accused masking fact. Probably literally can‚Äôt go outside without eyes burning smoke blame though? way people higher density. feel like situation way harder manage. wouldn‚Äôt blame subsidiary Reuters  comment downvotes post upvotes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Herd thinning best. took trash bins tonight, scooped yard dog poop, came inside dry heaved. eyes felt like I'd pool.

Also Seattle area. wearing regular cloth mask PM2.5 filter. like 10 countries whole world. Also, country u since say ""us""? I'm US able go house pleased. wtf u talking about? India's deaths low? reporting missing something?  near enough New Yorkers got sick herd immunity Woo-hoo!! Florida opened bars!!! cases reinfection, point it‚Äôs considered anomaly. Again, safe. Wear mask. Social distance also stay away everyone stay inside can. 

But let‚Äôs fear monger. great fuckin post Fucking ANTIFA stop nothing take America!

&amp;#x200B;

/sarcasm Argentina lockdown since March 20th _cries Indian_ Herd immunity requires 75% population infected recovered. Can‚Äôt second wave first one never ends! unlikely based basic math. States shut times. Hearing restrictions Victoria I'm glad I'm living literal dictatorship.  Spain Italy France UK Greece among others serious restrictions going outside all. denying lockdown?? Oh ok, stand corrected. What‚Äôs unreasonable doctors/nurse/medical professionals people shit show didn‚Äôt take leave absence. need factor lives saved equation. It‚Äôs true. need vaccine reach herd immunity deaths would much much higher.  agree there‚Äôs much harm. However, association studies big confounder. Comorbidities keep people inside. somewhat hard control even current severity scores. Uh, kissing booths new hotness. great! hate this. literally hate this. figuratively, literally. agree think main sentiment everyone admitted hospital swabbed asymptomatic cases discovered testing. ridiculed solution give money navy build large ships. Nope. Testing hasn‚Äôt reduced enough account decrease new cases top percent positive decreasing past month. Must good news /u/Ngstskr happy Danish government taking actions, counterpart Sweden done nothing. 

* Norway stopped serving Alcohol midnight, happened? Parties moved villas apartments instead, indoors ventilation control
* Denmark politicians saw perfect same, decided close bars midnight. Parties continues parks home instead. 
* work lets close bars even earlier, allow parties move uncontrolled area even sooner, let everyone get drunk earlier quicker.. 
* Also wear mask, allow take off, place table every time need take sip Carlsberg. Wear mask, looks good you.

It looks like Denmark realizes wont get virus control vaccine sight lets go herd immunity without telling population. 

Denmark made imperative wear mask four weeks ago public transport. Seems working well. 5G Africa?

/s back standing room weekdays. like ""fuck, even fit thing"" crowds normal rush hour seats taking people standing still positive rate continued drop. Scientists believe humans build immunity like virus catch. headlines blown take proportion.

Source: means enough people social distancing observing good hygiene slow spread. addition bump immunity. put border controls 2015? 

But yeah put up. less people travel pandemic, better. done March.

I think get corona tested mandatory airports borders. EU. Percent positive country overall decreasing, though. *Reported cases obfuscation reduced testing. live Atlanta, vast majority people wear masks required to, like entering store restaurant riding public transportation Probably south. I'm GA mask wearing basically thing outside enclaves. Median age Africa 18. 

Second youngest median aged continent South America 31. 

I imagine age distribution helpful. people Netherlands wear masks indoors except public transport. Thanks info! instead giving airlines blank check (that always, *always* trickles executives instead workers), give everyone sustained stimulus checks money Sneeze hand? many fingers noses? Kids gross, used one. think point need go herd immunity. There's large group people cluster fucked bad option. Even multiple vaccines hoaxers/anti-maskers take it. start documenting using protocol not. caught breaking safety standards insurance provider notified deny coverage get sick. questions regards zero transparency. want us believe everything OK move forward NIH can't even get answers - that's bit concerning. Also anyone know placebo tested another vaccine (meningococcal) instead saline solution? Honestly curious heard that. course is. made amino acids. 

In theory could make kind organism, like fish plant. says 10,000 day 10 tablets! I‚Äôve ordered potent stuff 1 day Herd immunity? Fat chance. London population around 9 million, roughly 41k cases since january. Herd immunity requires least %30 immune sort protections, take maths phd figure one out. flair have/use Russia?

EDIT: Ah, see... like Russia sometimes counted Europe (by population), sometimes Asia (by land mass), flair used inconsistent, too: think really need shared receptacle every kid neighbourhood dip in. Cannot see single downside ;) forget lick fingers kids, that's magic happens. Jaundice. Potentially due drug alcohol abuse damaging liver. I'm predicting never end. world stuck even try slow spread. new flu. I'm leaning towards reinfection real thing implications revaluation. However, think it'll low percentage population susceptible short term. SARS-COV-2 mutating quite bit may need vaccinated couple times per year. would hope is. Although every horror story non availability beds. Although situation definitely better 2-3 months ago. understand people sense wear masks they're out, understand need sudden urge people reason. there's talk opening trains general public. think even God help.

Edit : love Pune breaks see bad state.  I've heard 2,000 IU average weight 4,000 obese. researchers launching follow-up studies people infected SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19. Several focus damage specific organs systems; others plan track range effects. United Kingdom, [Post-Hospitalisation COVID-19 (PHOSP-COVID) aims follow 10,000 patients year, analysing clinical factors blood tests scans, collecting data biomarkers. similar study hundreds people 2 years launched United States end July.  find crucial treating lasting symptoms trying prevent new infections lingering. ‚ÄúWe need clinical guidelines care survivors COVID-19 look like,‚Äù says Nahid Bhadelia, infectious-diseases clinician Boston University School Medicine Massachusetts, setting clinic support people COVID-19. ‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt evolve quantify answers come quickly. ‚ÄúThe problem is,‚Äù says Gholamrezanezhad, ‚Äúto assess long-term consequences, thing need time.‚Äù 

...and funded research, suppose...

Check r/Long_Covid texts long covid. It‚Äôs true. although it‚Äôs great people getting higher education, also means degree less valuable (depending major). you‚Äôve worked extra hard get school that‚Äôs exponentially competitive get 10-20 years ago, you‚Äôve paid 25Ok+, still can‚Äôt find job without family connections 10x amount applicants college degrees. incur debt going grad school order differentiate peers. It‚Äôs endless. feel bad younger generation. I'm sending gift bags kids family. kids real thing next year hope. Yeah, it‚Äôs like kids wearing masks, it‚Äôs outdoors, risk people definitely can‚Äôt turn porch light.

Oh wait... Well real joy! awful man. I'm worried everyday there's news hospitals pune filling up, oxygen unavailability, enough beds ICUs.

I think infra Mumbai holding better? US leading, selfish world gotten. Even reading comments ‚Äúhope doesn‚Äôt kill someone love‚Äù. hoping doesn‚Äôt kill someone who‚Äôs following guidelines. 

People don‚Äôt understand easy help another person cost yourself. Give people compliments, stop fucking rushing stressing others outs, stay away people, wear fucking mask. 

Weather want believe science things like wearing mask painless easy get free. 

America change ‚Äúhome free‚Äù ‚Äúhome me‚Äù everyone else doesn‚Äôt matter people. You‚Äôre means end way. Take upvote. Covid much less deadly before. articles suggesting virus mutated became less deadly. makes sense, virus needs keep host alive order spread, words, hosts die - enough time spread virus contrary, strain less severe virus survives longer time host infecting people - less severe strain virus. March! NJ got hit hard March April stayed home wore masks. they‚Äôre back it‚Äôs essentially gone NJ. Never even hit full hospital capacity. NJ amazing. Let's bring old border control again, one Danes established violation EU Schengen rules. danes sure take train till Malm√∂ - real threat positive cases skyrocketing. Malmo never close numbers Copenhagen seeing. Yeah, NIH (pretty much last government institution worth damn) worried, I'm worried. transverse myelitis, theoretically possible could adverse event vaccine? Maybe? knows... There's information it, frustrating worrying. refuse get vaccinated see data myself, hear independent vaccine safety boards, go everything physician. Prior fulfilling things, I'm get it.

Schools open restaurants  Unfortunately disagree comment.


Putting personal politics opinions aside, without vaccine significant portions population continue stay locked in, economy continue suffer. continue see partial reopenings, leading spikes cases, closing again. deadlyl disease care freedoms rights feelings, can't ignore facts science.


Unfortunately US, time avoid current situation passed, January-March. Without locking border entire world (!) mandating 3-4 week hard lock aggressive contact tracing, mandatory quarantine everyone enters country means, destined get now, fast. countries done exactly this, stores never close due virus. Taiwan best example.


This country's leaders information power lock downs early year. knew. chose nothing. politics matter, everyone needs make top priority vote year, always.


The way open US partially lock state borders implement quarantine measures creating ""bubbles,"" open cases control enforcing mask physical distancing. ever see happening. remaining way wait vaccine.


I really sympathize suffering mental health problems isolation. go back normal eventually, cases low certain areas physical distancing masks public spaces. California tried opening up, saw huge spikes cases, shut again. really can't return normal without vaccine point. Agree, intersting see happens winter. 

What flat disagree with? It‚Äôs good first step likely need reiterated more. issue small antibody fragments small get cleared fast body. means basically constantly infused drug get necessary therapeutic level. need even try means administration since drug available use shots inhalation like suggest. would make scaling population even greater challenge.

still careful comes home, keep ventilation going. Im quarter system thinking differently. imagine semester campus whol year though. many deaths/hospitalizations? Good news me. identify hamster. *theoretical* vaccine. taking absolutely granted one actually way, side-effect-free, available mass distribution nationwide. 

That's what's bit unbelievable. Given number sheer fuck-ups last six months, think blowing happy sunshine ass think we've got control. Geaux Corona! take - opinion piece. think lot valid points like take time know effective vaccine across population. take months distribute vaccine well. think it‚Äôs pretty harsh opinion, lot sense say , ""we need continue exceedingly careful even immunize"".

Stay hopeful! Every day discovering better treatments people getting tested. get vaccine. might rough ride, world gone pandemics life return normal eventually. wanker He's saying found easy way check myocarditis check everyone tests positive play do, sit season. right article. People believe like believe, everyone does, hoaxers

Even among believe current US numbers, almost everyone still hold onto pre-March US numbers true, though US government pathological liars March.

They that, start questioning pre-March numbers, start question origin, want believe could them. Wired reporting this, Washingtn Post Reuters? ham payers

""Nobody pays ham."" explained better me, keep simple :) wear masks distance ourselves, even Covud gone, ""do everything protect people die""? Genuine question, going rhetoric leads that. very. Viruses animal families aren‚Äôt perfect analogy, works okay.

Guess - science give crap bias. want wear bubble wrap bed virus, go it. know science agree you. 10 years Completely agree. lot easier keep social distancing think may good news months. Thinking it'll 18 months drive people take risks. We've already locked 6 months Well, it‚Äôs sad that... sports.. apparently take precedent spread deadly global pandemic disease.

I mean; ok told us care inevitable consequences. 

Congrats trash guess? don‚Äôt know. Everyone telling people priorities life year: know yours. case, fine. masks protect *you* *it*; they're protect *others* *you* *it* there's 50/50 shot someone feeling completely fine still carrying virus.

So dipshit saying either ignorant masks important (best case), give fuck anyone else. Which, given he's one Gallagher brothers... stop marvel. Hahahahah, okay, stop working   smart think yourself, know fed BS.

When CDC said wear masks unhelpful, could actually cause infection.... told wife....""nope, that's BS"". Either they're lying intentionally someone graduated school. I've never heard respiratory disease instructed people wear masks.

First, there's little way could actually prove protests caused increase infection not. know infection youth increased considerably.  also know contact tracers medical officials told ask tested attended protests.

Did Sturgis contribute increasee infection...? Church contribute increased infection...? protests contribute increased infection...?

I would say definitely, cases. 

Don't forget redditors shaming people wearing masks medical experts said to.... they're side now, miraculously forgotten stood.

I'm saying happen, I'm saying drawing conclusions cannot draw cases presenting healthcare system overwhelmed bother treat vulnerable; outright scarificed people care homes, putting morphine nothing else died thousands.

This draw conclusions. saying Sweden *bother* treat vulnerable *sacrificed* instead keep healthcare system overwhelmed. pretty serious accusations provided evidence happened way suggest. basically suggesting doctors spent entire careers taking care curing people would suddenly okay letting die even actively killing denying access basic care. seem plausible you? think Sweden educates doctors way?

Gee, turns spreading infectious disease morally neutral! We're 9 months pandemic, think they'd figured out. mean makes sense me, China COVID control. much better could change another serious outbreak takes place, Gao said.** live Perth, Western Australia. lock down. Completely eradicated virus. Less 10 deaths state wide (our state 1/3 Australia). live completely freely almost restrictions. Take nonsense go fuck self. report questioning ‚Äòwhat economic impact COVID-19 small businesses UK‚Äô. part this, looking variety industries assessing impacts, healthcare one them. However, finding difficult find statistics comes private healthcare sector swamped NHS statistics can‚Äôt use report. Therefore created survey asking everything need know trying get many responses possible. own/run business fits parameters (i.e. UK, 50 employees, healthcare business) would appreciative able take time fill survey. 

On top this, anyone sources could look at, knows would find looking for, even knows else could post this, would also helpful. 

Thanks nice day! Anyone make think Jedward favourably compared probably trash. thought ibuprofen one bombed?

Edit: looks like info outdated, knew something would save lives tells people opposite??

No that's happened. data cloth mask pretty darn effective.

You concerned withheld information would save lives. calculated telling people wear masks would cost lives. remember time significant Community transmission major shortages hospitals nurses wearing garbage bags. public buying masks would result poor distribution masks. way increase overall number masks.

Also know said behind closed doors Trump need PPE future. public instructed do.

That said, judgment call I'm convinced necessarily right one decision made equipment facts available.

Edit - typo lead dipshit facts, can't make think.

(hopefully obvious, Im referring dipshit spreading misinformation yourself) Gates Foundation funding 7 so, precisely avoid delay.  know people different are. Maybe they're projecting hate themselves. seems unnecessarily cruel unusual. personally agree judges choosing type community service. judged allowed choose give back society. Letting judges choose people serve lead abuse.

It may optional, still funnel low cost labor towards specific organizations projects detriment judged society. measures capable eradicating virus completely

Empirical evidence shown it‚Äôs practically impossible. Even country BEST positioned eradicate it, sparsely populated totally isolated island middle ocean (New Zealand) failed eradicate it, even thinking sooooooooo close. 0/195 countries eradicated it, even best positioned so. Eradication fool‚Äôs goal.    think may missed point. 

America‚Äôs involvement 4 years. 4 years decisions nations leadership made impacted next 70 years American world politics. 

You can‚Äôt see future. can‚Äôt predict happen 2 days let alone 4 years. responsible intelligent leadership essential times. one knew COVID-19 going happen, still think voter apathy would quite bad was?

You get chance vote think best given option election. Regardless party politics vote cast favour competent reliable leadership available don‚Äôt know next four years straight forward life normal faced daunting life altering events. it‚Äôs latter you‚Äôll need strong leadership place point ship right direction. 

America immune fascism, incompetence even Asian born viruses. Assuming everything fine getting laugh pretentious ‚Äúthis show them‚Äù type administration contributed avoidable deaths Tens, hell hundreds thousands people. 

Be humble times Use vote wisely. may mean difference life death. see. teachers, outside perspective like mine, woefully under-payed? Money. I've working home since march go office last week things realized reason mental health fine entire lockdown didnt deal many people :/ won‚Äôt work according people here, nobody take vaccine Change seasons changes behavior. ask government bailout continue funding extravagant salaries administrators chancellors. even notice it. slightly different connotations ""comprehend"" , feeling like actively able grasp catch something new. energetic, sometimes urgent, word, whereas ""comprehend"" passive, like able work layers something you, dunno, furrow brow. He's praising lockdowns, anyways... Mask nothing else. I‚Äôm that. Wait mean tell Whitehouse spent last 4 years lying, manipulating fabricating crazy stories every day day finally gets control narrative coronavirus cases people honestly believed would tell truth üòÇ. moment took control narrative, numbers went sky rocketing magically dropping. fucking morons would fall atrocious lies believe anything coming Whitehouse. Oh wait half America full fucking morons suck dick trump like God guess makes sense many people believed lies. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs downslope much natural evolution capitalism. rich get richer, poor get poorer. mutation rate half low flu virus. may mutations spread population necessitate new vaccine stage. likely would need new vaccine every year. used think that, too, watched car car NC, VA, TN, PA, MD license plates flood state damn summer without spiking numbers. park anywhere months. dude, excess deaths week, cumulative total. Yes last 9 weeks, sweden shit control, make earlier excess deaths go away.

I also like proof Sweden excess mortality look graph say much overall excess mortality 2015

And China get neither. Congratulations! may watch say, restricted internet access, watch many kids have, watch religion believe in, *but,* least (allegedly) won‚Äôt catch Covid! posted something similar local news site comment got downvoted hell. really easy. making CERB deposits distribute masks. Okay? leads us believing there's anything called culture, obviously wrong. took hiking think about. leave bubble go woods hours, come close bringing tears great nature is. Wrong. It‚Äôll make poor kids earn number greater 3% less lifetimes. rich kids earn percentage lifetime. 


And average gets 3%  someone offered choice dining inside restaurant, letting hobo spit mouth...I'd think it. 

Poorly ventilated, unmasked people eating drinking aspirating coughing sneezing around you. somehow, majesty magical thinking, wear mask table, virus leave alone dine. 

I manage thinking sitting outside table, walking inside plague factory like that? 

It's gonna long, long time set foot restaurant again, ever. actually good fat ass cook everything home, think twice getting curbside delivery. I'm hoping there'll bit paradigm shift way restaurants think business model fixated dining-in. sterilize take it? Perfect! Pretty obvious it‚Äôs % active people immunity rising starting take serious toll virus‚Äôs ability spread, saying loud distasteful policy implications, official ever gonna say it. 

If need proof, look NYC, 20% immunity APRIL according antibody tests. Given exponential growth works, you‚Äôd pretty willfully ignorant pretend aren‚Äôt substantially higher now, that‚Äôs reason new cases trickle compared were. 

If every locale already major spike suddenly threw caution wind went life usual, cases would temporarily increase point threatening hospital capacity. We‚Äôd increased manageable deaths couple weeks steady trickle downward. one actually advocate approach you‚Äôre effectively advocating higher deaths may necessary, appropriate messaging everyone high alert there‚Äôs vaccine hopes spare lives vaccinating haven‚Äôt already developed antibodies time. 

Of course pessimist (or point, maybe realist) would say doesn‚Äôt matter there‚Äôs realistically way don‚Äôt already herd immunity time vaccine comes out, end place. They‚Äôre probably right, again, it‚Äôs inappropriate inconsiderate actually come say that. would opposite sociopath, seems least bit empathic saying might helpful talk someone, many people do. protective immunity, t-cell memory, leading completely changed picture epidemiology, would much evidence effect. also prove genuinely large portions population infected first time. There's evidence make sense. Canadian, us. closer severe cases. dude already tried come twice potentially slapped 700k cad fine.   That's true though. UK started showing significant growth toward end August. France, early August.  Spain mid July. Deaths starting show sustained increases Spain. moving average single digits around 50-60 per day. UK France see increase starting late September, early Oct. Bush Sr lost first term ended 1993 Bill Clifton.

That 5 presidents ago. entire premise prevent healthcare system overwhelmed

And rules thing preventing happening now. Yes, people New York refused tests early unless contact someone China, recently traveled, death bed. family able tested--even mom, lives 93 year-old grandmother. Bet, backup plan. wonder anyone expertise immunology vaccines weigh Fatigue setting in. physical emotional. People sick rules instead chugging along say, ""Fuck it!"" engage risky behavior like dining in, going movie, attending party. Tell rich college dropouts graph captures two things. Seasonality, first, also total cases substantially higher first, testing beginning.

It's almost certain outbreaks deaths winter. Yeah, live Southern VT little town common people walk around everything need close together, almost every person masked up. they're masked they're outskirts there's less people mask getting closer/passing people. really happy live do, beautiful place love culture here.  Funding testing cut, hence less tests haven‚Äôt tested nearly enough people. go Data SF verbatim says testing limited represents small sample size compared actual cases. Yes, cases deaths increasing, however numbers underreported. (which means they‚Äôre accurate) cases deaths higher reported July Trump rerouted data CDC White House downplay severity virus. (Which happened July)[Covid going emotional labor. Use Google research. Continue life, keep socially distant (but still social), wear masks public socially distant public indoors.

I view socially distant small social bubble communicate someone gets sick exposed. 

Some businesses based indoor gatherings move outdoors remain closed.

Do vaccine virus mutates.  understand second wave phenomenon actually represented correctly sources. wave hits first seasonally located temperature regions northern US EU, summer spike southernmore regions longer drawn lower peak. evaluated whole graph looks like two waves actually true, two seperate waves hitting two seperate places, without recursion.

It supremely unlikely another wave inside US tempurature regions hit, herd immunity built point it'll negligent. postive test cases keep going way hospitalizations deaths flatlined months now. Ya know wild was, I've never fun working movie theater. case England, spreading completely different spot. London hit hard spring, quite well now. sure Spain. ""The virus much seasonal expected ""

""The epidemic largely run course Europe.""

How say breath?

Here's fundamental point: done absolutley nothing - in, society, live life, bars, concerts etc. - would virus ""just run course"" go away? social distancing mattered?

If think would run course, crazy. feel you. I‚Äôm upset see /hug parents crying (not usually crier). Sadly, one health issues. live another city spikes can‚Äôt risk public transportation. suspect I‚Äôm going skip Thanksgiving first time decades.

The media doesn‚Äôt cover much emotional toll pandemic. lot people compliant, also sad, mad anxious.  wonder much time money group spends curbing power president. holding back election day. thought antibodies disappeared 3 four months? read somewhere I‚Äôm unsure legit is, please don‚Äôt kill I‚Äôm wrong. test antibodies don‚Äôt mind asking? sunlight breaks chlorine bleach rendering ineffective. part outdoor pools go chemicals faster indoor pools. going both, space injections... We're also jealous good jobs industry. trade culture/government operates think. I've thought moving NH children, better future NH raised live right VT (South go). never children, I'd rather live Vermont NH. really like culture here, beautiful course. know isn't? cuase important? lot assumptions here. cuase person important someone decides so? realize US severe lockdown Sweden? Look death curves, daily deaths Sweden peaked April, US daily deaths peaked July. Yes, US delayed epidemic 4 months. compatible we-can-not-do-a-lockdown?

Yes know spite numbers bad Swedens, since fucked mandatory lockdown think voluntary one work except course magical percentage swedish households singe generation? compare US?


You answer question. understand US, young people living parents time since 1940, according recent Pew Research Center analysis census data. 2019 study British think tank Civitas found proportion 23-year-olds living parents UK risen 37% 1998 49% decade later.
In Sweden it‚Äôs different story. common age leave home 18 19, compared EU average 26, according Eurostat figures. significant proportion young Swedes aren‚Äôt moving cramped house shares student dorms. living alone.

here brought up. see helps slow stop realize Americans using masks much extensively Swedes?

Yes, do, also understand structural advantages sweden US like huge percentage single generation households single payer health care strong safety net. 

mask use one thing. serves proxy behaviors denialists like large covid parties think US.

My point remains dipshits dipshit mandatory lockdown fucking response still dipshit voluntary people used mandatory stop.

again can't manage mandatory lockdown, manage voluntary compliance?  Even casedemic nutters arguing cases PCR positive cases Covid

I'm differentiating presence Sars-cov-2, vs development covid-19 - disease.

We approaching two months, start ""second wave"" France, UK, Netherlands, Spain etc, seeing associated mortality (even ""cases"" higher first wave).

At date comfortable revisiting it? Another month? another two months? check back then? Came say this. thought Chinese civil aviation overzealous banning 787 max. Turns we're slow. true, me, many others, especially districts good remote learning learn vital knowledge Uhhh don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs genocide... 2nd degree negligent manslaughter murder lots things doesn‚Äôt fit definition genocide don‚Äôt think? leaks real numbers? guess extrapolate increase otherwise normal levels deaths foreseeable future. Republicans never thought think! today 1 10 people walk convenience store mask less there's 2 wear completely wrong. zero way winter going less bad. People care anymore. I'm working mask face shield people cracking jokes. sad situation. need auditing large chains making sure spreading rampantly convenience stores. 200,000 dead. .5% infection fatality rate. least 40 million people it. That's 10% US. survey probably BS since many actual cases asymptomatic, number may right on. yes, america middle class gets education public schools understood ""catastrophic outcome"", lol? Replace ""disastrous result"" whatever, makes happy. 

Anyway: April May almost 5000 people died excess average number years 2015-19. lying fact excess mortality due Corona excess mortality compared 2015. Even if, cannot cherry pick single year... oof consistently advocated for? lists administrative funding excuses. inherent technological raw metal gap. uses oil sometimes wood raw material. let‚Äôs real math instead bullshitting. 

We‚Äôve averaged ~771 deaths per day past week. Deaths trending since July 21, ease math, prove point even more, let‚Äôs say 800 deaths per week RIGHT NOW. 

There 107 days left 2020 (fuck me). 194,000 deaths typing comment, meaning get 500,000 deaths, need 306,000 deaths. 

We need average roughly 2,860 deaths *per day* starting TOMORROW, hit mark. 

If assume exponential growth going thing, let‚Äôs assume (for ease math again) start ‚Äúkicking in‚Äù around October 1st, 2 week incubation yada-yada 2 weeks roughly end September works. 

So 15 days ~800 deaths per day = ~12,000 deaths = 206,000 total October 1st. 

You‚Äôd need ~3,300 deaths *per day* (which we‚Äôve never had, even April/May) hit 500K EOY. that‚Äôs GIVING benefit doubt assuming cases start trending right now, rounding amount days left year October 1. 

Don‚Äôt spew shit out. Plz let dumbass award... Yes! Quebec! haven‚Äôt traveled rest Canada they‚Äôre experience Canadians. confused whole ‚ÄúCanadians polite‚Äù thing started time worked service industry waited Canadians time. polite.

However, love rude selves spend money town keeps quaint alive. businesses really suffering border closed. Yeah, people vastly overstate threat (distanced) outside interaction... things like sitting park walking trail something. 

It *does* sound like football game went one outside environments unsafe though. Ahh, okay. read Atheist Manifesto Michael Onfray? would highly recommend it.

I guess could call Taoist, Lao Tzu federal level. So, hope trust employer? read old, West Bank robber costume... confused. they're clueless idiots bumbling dark.  ""Sociological variables""....cringe. seems like would take *very long time* Denmark's death rate get anywhere near Sweden's. Politically bad idea. Pool testing benefits small percentage population infected. infected population small, come election time politician eaten alive blowing budget performing unnecessary tests. 100% know impact, coronviruses including SARS-1 similar. 

Viral infections cause issues post-infection, majority people recover baseline. even true SARS-1, coronavirus much higher hospitalization rate CFR. 

Its okay take precautions. still careful there. sounds little bit like many putting virus pedestal like kind super virus. Besides novel regular virus likely reach endemic level eventually. quite contagious, that's makes special.

Viral infections cause problems, reason much C19 researched like virus ever modern world. downplaying severity, nasty novel virus. reason fear god.

And we're seeing likelihood asymptomatic cases getting much higher people mask social distance. ways risk mitigate. fact majority cases testing positive PCR ran tests found low infectious level point shown rapid, meaning they're likely contagious. data NY Nevada suggested 90%. 

A pandemic never good, neither fear mongering either. Relax little. Take precautions still, relax. comment means people know this, happen. complete utter lack EQ help either.


This come find people like me. We‚Äôll see.  think clueless idea read academic journal.  probably know sources bs.  Majority Africans don‚Äôt enough money sufficient testing, god knows bad pandemic theory urban Africans likely infected one common human corona viruses could cross immunity. 

Rural Africans spend day outside. Facebook ‚Äúresearch‚Äù much scientific advice actual medical experts  Xi‚Äôs dick taste? would probably look cool stupid fuck worn public I‚Äôm you. I‚Äôm concerned ADE, concerned regular, frequent re-infection non-neutralizing antibodies.

I wanted clarity here. know ADE phenomenon exists; know it‚Äôs observed Coronaviruses. heard zero reports happening SARS-COV-2, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm trying clarify. myth guys r/sweden keep bringing Danes testing without reason.


[‚ÄùSwedish Myth‚Äù: **exibit er tale om ¬ªtesthysteri¬´, n√•r tusindvis af danskere hver dag bliver testet covid-19 ‚Äôbare en sikkerheds skyld‚Äô, siger Jonatan Schloss, der er direkt√∏r de Praktiserende L√¶gers Organisation (PLO), til m√• man gerne blive testet, men man beh√∏ver det ikke hele tiden eller hver uge,¬´ siger han.

Are saying isn‚Äôt even talked Denmark? really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something Swedes made up, seems like real concern. .5 per 5000 60 million people getting still much  fear disability far fear death. I‚Äôve genuine near death experiences, kind traumatically dissociate 100% body. mind body connection severs, thing happens die, hence brain experiences real death. Extreme violence, torture, sexual violence, etc cause this.

Dying isn‚Äôt bad. People near death experiences often describe point become calm docile accept going die. let go relax start getting high chemicals brain releases, like endogenous pain killers endorphins.

Disability fucking awful. I‚Äôve working accept genuine psychological disability (severe complex PTSD nightmare childhood) grief overwhelming times. simply can‚Äôt things used do, like multitasking complex cognitive tasks. feel memory getting worse. bad days I‚Äôm non-functional. hospitalized mental health treatment program earlier year gotten severe. lost job well whole career dog/cat veterinarian. can‚Äôt anymore matter hard try.

Disability worse death. Death isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs harder leave behind you. Disability forever. entered quarantine March never left. fucking way I‚Äôm risking heart damage. I‚Äôve treated enough heart disease know severely limit quality life. really think peaked July? case, see peak deaths following july peak?

I think much likely peaked back March/April, based peak deaths occured. believe it.

It‚Äôs insane can‚Äôt open web browser see countries responded.

* [Trump‚Äôs approval ratings far unusually stable - deeply me, results ~200k deaths absolutely unreal.

* Group feels threatened coronavirus others wearing masks respect social distancing etc. 

* Group B feel threatened coronavirus feels threatened government individuals imposing limits, fines economical loss loss freedom privacy. 

You find ""radicals"" sides equation. Group likely become ""Individual terrorists"" individuals (harassment physical violence wearing masks) Group B likely become ""Individual terrorists"" government (for luckily protests). judge really little it. grassroots lawsuit filed several community groups.

Now Hong Kong 2% Chinese GDP really matter anymore economically political win sure.

The disadvantages China major however.

* reputation damaged. tried recover mask diplomacy sort backfired.

* outward investment come halt almost projects outside China frozen Chinese companies forced turn attention inwards.

* reputation party inside China also damaged many Chinese outraged initial cover up. Even though probably local cover national leadership involved.

* inequality risen. Many companies fired low skilled workers automated work. process already ongoing got massive boost covid-19

* importantly many countries lost trust China working together isolate China. could large impact future.

All all, think Chinese people leaders would agree would much rather live world covid-19. [Like Didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt need vaccinate population‚Äù? mean... communist country spies US hacks US, creates vaccine, US take one won‚Äôt give population first?

I think it‚Äôs reasonable skeptical new injections, simply it‚Äôs new vaccine untrusted source source saying ‚Äúyou first‚Äù Defo lol flu actually common co-morbidity. 

A strong theory someone would likely survived Covid flu, greatly increased risk death time. 

Get yer flu shots folks. Unfortunately people exist? anyone actually met one? also erases kind prejudices public policy story, politics.

Ahhhh . . . really possible one without other? timeline, Trump, Republicans abandoned everything they've ever held ideological roots cling fat grift sweet sweet court appointments.

So whereas previous Republican politicians may worked prepare country pandemic response years past, that's completely window choice. *is* politics it, basis story. We're almost year one Republican side stood Trump, fact Republican governors gone extra mile enforce measures - suing municipalities trying wear masks - ensure pandemic continue rage bafflingly misguided attempt appease Trump something.

The story almost exclusively politics. Republican politics. Trump. Agreed.

Peak social distancing (based mobility data) occurred mid April, first week July social distancing within percent normal. 

I think based data could conclude anything virus burned (more less) social distancing notwithstanding. 

To sure sure can't detect increase hospitalization deaths coincide return normal.

It‚Äôs ok bigger group outside still maintain distance wear mask. 

Or it‚Äôs ok go inside smaller groups take extra precaution. Don‚Äôt stay anyone closed spaces long (more 15mins) inside look places good ventilation, big open windows breeze coming hepa ventilation systems. Good you! always need people front lines.

However, read paper back suggesting actual deaths might around 75% higher recorded deaths. Even US under-counting certain degree (and lots reports is), Brazil might #1 count total excess deaths.

Right now, NY death toll still double state US. Despite, say, California currently \~200k confirmed cases NY does. 

Leaving aside nursing home debacle, theory death toll high NY due ""sudden"" boom cases, earlier pandemic. think multiple factors like still new, Doctors sure treat effectively, lack PPE, delays shortages testing, overloading health care system. 

but curious peoples thoughts. Well, grt sick watch die then. hope pos digs graves pays bills Seeing number cases grown significantly, number hospitalizations down/flat, can't 20% cases lead hospitalization. ratio grown wider time.

What's more, 20% cases hospital much large number. would overwhelming numbers. hospitalization rate much much lower. likelihood serious complications higher. mean serious complications. worth, hardly *less* capable masks ones people make old table cloths like. mean, masks still 100% bullshit sellers trying make masks rated way still giving genuine attempt making mask would also impacted removing masks storefront.

this people listen Bill Gates.  believe protests was/is good idea likely contribute spreading covid areas. believe otherwise? protests cause spreading football games safe? 

There also way alcohol football games protests. comments worded like this, can't believe serious. would way get money. Lol it‚Äôs literally death death cost pill even gets facility inflated pharma industry much able. USA fails regulate drug costs. 

If someone's drowning lake, come say, ‚ÄúI'm willing save you, pay $100,000,‚Äù called exploitation. different someone dying cancer, say, ‚ÄúI'm willing save you‚Äîbut $140,000, please?‚Äù 

By failing regulate drug costs, USA allows rampant exploitation citizens pharma profit. Covid's effects violate people's default expectations life. us budget psychologically whatever crud comes flu cases, college drinking, ambient auto fumes, etc., bother look details. really think Boris smarter low bar we‚Äôve set US.

What I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs normal person‚Äôs fault Donald Trump can‚Äôt trusted. gives reasons trust least weekly. That‚Äôs him. like vaccine makers, phase 3 trials countries still high transmission.

CanSino (Saudi Arabia), Sinovac (Brazil) &amp; Sinopharm (Peru, Morocco UAE) I'm sure 75% America college close by. do? feel helpless Chances won‚Äôt. Careful! said start told degree worth even get job field. told ""what else would kids do"". :) see karma incoming... People America believe masks kind talismanic power keep safe; really there's much research suggesting that's so. Classic Americanism, clinging materials. Physical distancing important masks. recently seen large crowded events lots people screaming apparently cause spread virus? ü§î far aware, hospitalizations occur roughly 20% cases. total cases are, hospitalizations occur. Well death rate 0.0067 Sweden 10 million people max deaths us 67000 people. look like avoided worst 10% deaths. 

In comparison France 66million people. Maxing 442k deaths. 30k deaths deaths rising slowly. Wonder would hit natural decline 10k deaths. 

US 327m, deaths max 2.19million. We're 10% 200k right now. see deaths declining soon? assumption u reopened schools u'd get people immunity ur population relative small numbers deaths.? Here's latest case/death charts Michigan, running 7-day done admirable job overall, cases deaths much lower. Still, taken big hit. They're 69.20 deaths per 100k, well US per capita average 58.4.'

That ranks 10th overall among US Wow, say first virus ever cause this? Who's fear mongering now? someone tell wearing mask causes people age seven years faster mask one month wear. countered (all?) surgical colleagues nurses look like cryptkeeper underneath masks wear masks 8-12 hours + daily. freaking idea people getting information, would say authority pretty boggling. Also: skin doctor. exhausting... saw ad online. first thought work mesh. people see youtube comment sections say virus fake vaccine plant microchips body controlled 5g. something along lines. 

When ask proof tell research shit like that. Nothing say based facts anything. wondering get point think al governments world controlled organizations Bill gates making vaccine microchips control everyone dude's whole account dedicated praising CCP. doubt get logical debate. successfully, guess? competing bottle finish work vaccines need well. called upcoming antibody rollout test vaccine rollout. COVID juggernaut vascular system. :( Except doesn‚Äôt work. Nice one US! worry second wave infection, first one never really ends! Genius! massive stadium also still 50,000 people half capacity. Even take every person [in still farther 3 feet person next you. 

People screaming yelling top lungs. People take masks drink water doubt put right back up, especially 100F high humidity outside. addition, alcohol decrease inhibition. 

People meet game go eat pre-game. mention 20 minutes takes exit stadium game ends packed walkway like sardines. 

I think football game fine terms risk vs rewards players coaching staff tested regularly. fans stands raises risk exponentially good idea IMO.  think incredibly nebulous frankly nonsensical criteria phrase ‚Äúunder control‚Äù. significant case growth NY since June. hyped bit media. great, numbers steadily dropping. Deaths per capita per day peaked March. Infections per capita per day peaked mid July. Things getting slowly better. think he's saying people get arms decisions made people's eyes made context ""Dems v Reps"". Reality people jobs people perpetuate decisions made political damaging integrity entire discussion.  kidding. hearing called antibody breakthrough stories months still sign treatment sight. Brush yo teeth nose breath. Thank additional information! related point small pieces information even touched mainstream media. many different factors judge ""success"" fighting COVID-19. total test, test per capita, positivity rate, deaths per capita, deaths per infected individual, etc. Lol, Steve Bannon funded think first kids empty bowl. title seems pretty sensational, think good long term struggle anti-vax movement people publicly saying can't trust government/FDA/CDC whether vaccines safe. ok, let's go back square one: believe ok people gather large groups pandemic?

Yes no? read abstract, see tested hamster model also using modified virus infect mice...hopefully human trials stand happen Ha. people care much others you‚Äôre willing stay locked six months people wishing death others. whole thing fucking stupid. much this. 6 million cases later people still don‚Äôt want take responsibility themselves. What? finished week six, following additional three stay-at-home orders, makes total nine weeks counting. Six weeks til lose curfew restricts freedom behave foolish harmful manner. preliminary hypotheses papers Covid causes damage physiologically similar Vitamin b12 deficiency. Loss smell, taste, nerve problems seem confirm that, taking b12 *might* help. explain fact *hospitalizations* down, then?

What basing theory on? decision let die good time.

As usual, things like getting quality education, employed support family one's mental well-being belittled lockdown extremists say want open ""just want good time."" ‚ÄúThis guy frequently makes false statements subjects far removed expertise trust least understand numbers, right? tell official numbers wrong even though can‚Äôt source them.‚Äù 

See that? That‚Äôs sound right now. people real life? come reddit, see people talking vigilant ones. friends (who claim concerned vigilant careful) going restaurants sending kids school. liberal (politically), educated, sensible friend group yet mine still literally family know socializing eating out. Underrated comment lol It‚Äôs truly exhausting demoralizing times, think end it‚Äôs worth it. Taking safety measures like sinking titanic bucket. It‚Äôs discouraging trying hardest keep people safe seeing people think you‚Äôre dumbass don‚Äôt care UK. Thanks. I'm Texas much better recently.   Deaths probably peak Jan/Feb anyway people Christmas gatherings matter what. lot people would rather die skip Christmas, year many will. Congress address problem give everybody break student loan payments.

Or, take money Jeff Bezos made since beginning pandemic use pay everybody's loans. would good solution would favor of. never stopped anyone traveling all.

That's would impossible legally so. 

Germany, Italy, France, etc close borders, did. single US state allowed close borders, given right able move freely country.

Hence much harder contain people flee states getting hit hard, someone goes vacation NYC, anything else like that.

Do really think, could've, blocked people entering leaving NY State back March? Fair enough. don‚Äôt think evidence/experts agree you. also go around kissing birds either. overstate something like that. Ah yes, classic ‚ÄúI proven wrong, data clearly manipulated/is incorrect‚Äù argument.

Based actual data, cases deaths declining since July. refuse accept premise, there‚Äôs point arguing further. safe, effective vaccine going ready widespread distribution mid 2021. That‚Äôs long. issue forcing workers exposed virus filled ass option homelessness. decide yourself, decided people option. want fun. selfish. However want justify yourself, putting others harm needlessly want fun. textbook definition selfish, get innocent workers killed. 

I hope parties worth people's lives. wish ones got make decision, you. USA peaked July due seasonality/different climates/latitude, case vital infections.

Completely totally incorrect. peaked reopened mandate masks.

Compare actual incidence respiratory diseases state. peak winter, weeks difference most. Climate nothing saw. problem assessment ‚Äúsystem‚Äù isn‚Äôt designed work part. dangerous times us.  opinion people something really stupid, like ""throwing ragers"", doesnt mean shouldnt consider options try reduce spread normal people too. focus ""idiots"", really think stop them? want despite ""attention/worry"". 

Reasonable adults potentially listen guidelines recommendations. Idiots not. no. wonder many get Trump's recent indoor super-spreader event. Holy crap, I‚Äôm expert kinda seems like big deal New Jerseyian native New Yorker, feel saying.

give people option quarantine. young people partying, hospitalized, fucking stupid apply one-size-fits-all lockdown. older faculty staff afraid, online courses. want campus, go. autumn terrible fall.

Edit: currently it, apparently doesn‚Äôt work. Everyone‚Äôs favorite Sweden completely unable protect vulnerable. cannot isolated virus rampant among families, neighbors, customers, students. 

Your decision let die good time.  99.98% think missed point.

If people live certain area give bigger UBI, drive costs area, cause UBI increase area, cause UBI increase.

It feeds bad cycle reality living high COL luxury, that's high COL. Currently exists problem phyiscal mobility difficult poor people struggle get expensive cities compounds problem, guaranteed pay check, would MUCH easier pick move, comfortable screwing (for lack better term) people live high CoL areas know choice. still grasp herd immunity virus still spread. plan drive working poor mountain dead protects stock market. something. That's see. Meanwhile, countries like Taiwan 2x population Sweden crammed way closely together regulations facemasks correctly managed needless deaths *AND* avoid lockdowns. Sweden better Western countries handled like shit, mean approach ideal either. family could this, won't. I'm afraid winning again. wins we'll never get rid it. lot people confused 10 day 14 day recommendations. 

* It‚Äôs 10 days first symptoms (or pos test). point (as article says) you‚Äôre unlikely contagious more.
* it‚Äôs 14 days you‚Äôre exposed/close contact positive case. **the window developing first symptoms**.
* may apply. develop symptoms and/or pos test Day 12 quarantine, wait additional 10 days leave.
* case, kid got COVID, quarantined caring 10 days. cleared, start 14 day quarantine technically exposed last day (day 10). trust Chinese numbers. sure getting at. I'm criticising SCMP. Maybe recognizes science still new, individual cases outliers, he‚Äôd rather take extremely conservative position. ingested orally right source degrade.

Peru's economy gets tremendous boost. Trump loses, everything ensure happens. Except it'll probably delayed bit peaks around January February, average death 2-5 weeks infection exponential nature spread means deaths end, take Biden weeks months sort mess Trump intentionally creates. 

And better believe talk radio pointing much worse everything got Trump lost, pretending Biden responsible everything moment election. I‚Äôd expand issue pace things backyard (aka city / state / maybe country). 

Sure, people ‚Äúcare‚Äù yes, covid bad stuff take seriously attitude towards downstream impacts entire industries segments population become callus. 

Of course can‚Äôt magically fix stop could least stop dismissing talking easy stay (with magic Uber eats amazon deliveries coming course). 300,000... 19, got immune system easily rip virus. Note though barely got sick probably also barely neutralizing antibody response illness. still want avoid getting reinfected passing on, avoid high viral dose exposure, still want get vaccinated (which produce neutralizing antibody response stronger ICU month). Like bullshit going around weeks back ""only 6% people die Covid!"" breaking people's brains locally actually agreeing actually closer 0% explaining why, unfortunately I'm sure got across one. Greedy colleges hurting country. fuck can't college kids take gap year? college would taken excuse gap year fucking second gamed year. ""Sorry parents, can't look job can't go college, COVID that. sit play games, health. what's dinner?"" right there, wrapped bow. college kids taken advantage skipped year. better excuse could ever ask for? us trying. 

Some us think hoax made make idiot president look bad. Like needs help. newssite wrong. actual report says admission reduced 8 days, 8 days 14. 20 12. alternative unnecessary death working make sure eat? Yes, hike price. Uh oh, far right Christians US worship Israel going say? either hoax, Israel always correct. isn't. objective reality. need accept it. don't, get consequences. works vitro mice... making work humans lies every single therapy tried failed.  Agreed, fair sounds like promising date. (I'm excited think thought last time ever!) use witch doctors usually US government going say *natural* virus whether thought not. Say 10% insulin bad. QC problem criminal neglect? Influenza around centuries, mapped till 1933. even know virus 1918 pandemic.

So less century FYI. 

The key critical information, confuse pre prints peer reviewed studies look study detail.

A headline like 70% people heart abnormalities covid sounds terrifying. realise rate control group 60%. reporting covid complications mentioning observed icu patients etc

This subreddit takes headlines face value really. similar result (out control cellular replication) causes very. hereditary issues leading people develop cancer. Others due environmental causes like radiation carcinogenic chemicals. Still others virus caused forms cervical cancer. Basically, even though may similar ways cures treatments vary based specific cancer. I'm hoping there's invisible /s somewhere... good masks going wearing though? going masks like lone ranger wore? going masks holes around mouth? know anyone living nursing home? think want isolated loved ones last year(s) lives? isolation bad health. Again, depends situation. know prices due immunology class granted, prices go depending insurance cover. personally know, IV plasma even syringe antibodies (antibody monoclonal antibodies ((mabs)) little $150 go there. 

I‚Äôm sorry situation. hope family recovered that- especially son. hope he‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs fault prices high- it‚Äôs another flaw US healthcare system (that you‚Äôre living US).  Ah thanks. Ok, here's came article today saying church goers 16X likely get covid people! 

The study Johns Hopkins School Medicine [you read fuck come think true? 

They sampled 1,030 individuals Maryland June capture information SARS-CoV-2 positivity. think true followed scientific method studying individuals' large, socially isolated room really 16X dangerous grocery store, post office, doctor's office, hospital, restaurant, house party?

No, actually - that's misreading study. church three times two weeks study 16x dangerous than... church 3+ times period. say 16x dangerous going places said. finding significant behavior study people rode public transit 3+ times period 4x likely get COVID people didn't.

You might still wondering - statistics show Maryland residents studied 4x likely get COVID went church rode public transit? proven study experiment, can't prove causation. guess, I'd say A. average church service longer average bus ride, close proximity others longer period time, B. church, people recite liturgy sing, activities which, sadly, involve shooting particles mouth air, whereas public transit, people mostly sit try acknowledge other.

Hope helps understand article published! I'm curious understand little better, still feel garbage meant ""shut down"" church ""industry"" also feel meant shut public transit. lockdown sucks sure. even though I'm city longer locked shit sucks too. Lockdown obviously sucks think point even could move new city would worth unless moved place close friends. don‚Äôt understand blame lockdown orders, proven effective elsewhere, weekly news reports asshats throwing huge mansion parties, conspiracy morons gathering huge groups ‚Äúpatriotism‚Äù president politicized wearing mask. Maybe people actually followed lockdown rules, would see results expect? thought. March? Well Dutch experts decide. far they've come said experiments research shows wearing masks provide significant impact case numbers. 

Maybe wrong, seem pretty confident. far outbreak Covid-19 Netherlands contained fairly well comparison countries. Awesome!! Borrowing idea! read article? says showed promising results mice, tests needed. actually refreshing change ""journalism"" referring to. I‚Äôm sure future look shaking damn heads: it‚Äôs taking state 4-10 days notify public outbreak school. know help, here's hug. feels like ship sinking people trying stop others trying make sink faster That's different film. Coronation Ai Weiwei based smuggled footage 3rd parties subjects know would filmed part movie. 

76 days Hao Wu people officially sanctioned ground Wuhan filming subjects knew would eventually turned documentary.

Two different approaches two different lenses event. public school funding abysmal.

Per U.S. Census Bureau spent average $12,201 per pupil 2017. Throwing money problem going solve anything. No, shortage masks anymore. pretty surprising even told care home workers wear them. must wear them... well, basically everywhere, especially working visiting care home. whole year best days holidays, look calendar. Cinco de Mayo tuesday FFS! opinion based science like (it came scientific committee) feel short? neighbor always sets decorations bowl candy sign says ‚ÄúTake one, watched!‚Äù

Again, reading comprehension astonishingly bad.

Spoiler alert: pandemic 0 cases (as in, future). mean absolutely nobody die point happens.

Saying ""in future 0 cases"" translated ""absolutely nobody die"". trolling point really bad connecting dots. actually decent progress treating cancer last decades years.  They're still reporting cases. They've brought insanely low amounts far tell. One never imbibe much. Infuriatingly, surprise anyone.

You‚Äôre obviously clicking wrong link then. vaccine arrives Suddenly, without lot fanfare Almost Ready (and think we'd know, great optimistic news sells well bad news days), yes, that's suspicious me.

LOL Yes! Get early on, try go off-times. pharmacy gets super busy flu shots it‚Äôs hard handle once. israel major corona outbreaks schools germany didn't? point suspect many people skeptical vaccine unless phase 3 clinical trials occur least part outside US (or China Russia).

That is, US-developed vaccine trialed large populations say ... France Spain Italy, countries approve use well, trust. however vaccine tested exclusively US, less trust.

This sad unfortunate outcome inept dishonest administration running show. want censor peer reviewed studies reach conclusion like? Maybe try less narrow minded look science/data there, *just* stuff already supports existing beliefs. might learn something. Bread circus, sports tribalism finest. keep seeing people say people think fake question lockdown rules. y'all sure whoever thinking literally thinks fake, annoyed want open schools/gym, whatever? got haircut 2 weeks ago everyone masked up.

Mask efficiency predicated fresh box. one clinical trials masks used 20 times.

Maybe reuse PPE mask companies want us spend money disposables actually fine.

Maybe reuse PPE every hour use drops effectiveness (eg--this real fact!).

So answer question simply MAYBE reusing disposables fine, one studied would wildly irresponsible guess either way. making disposable reuse solution without asking questions, leaders chosen lie say know fine. Someone needs charged manslaughter then. lot incorrect information.

You get immunity colds including ones caused coronaviruses, it‚Äôs many viruses cause colds immunity produced applies one virus often lasts 6-12 months so. due weak antibody responses mild infection mutation though. flu, hand, many existing strains mutates unusually fast, allowing reinfection occur.

So garbage like gets published, make people think ""oh, guess really disease, shutting specific industries""

Country A- covid test 100% free everyone provided national health care

Country B- covid test free some, $100 others, $1000 some. Google local health providers determine which.

I'm really shocked country B harder time testing.  Ofc pharmaceutical companies lying length time needed. üôÑ That's hear news local officials.

EDIT: lockdowns also needed ""flatten curve"". People tend self-correct behavior realize ""if get sick, hospital beds left"". following downvoted comment state bad situation be, soon. post study, downvote states anything bad.

It's definitely interesting debate. see happens fall winter, think Sweden reached level immunity would prevent second large outbreak. seems large areas country cases, making susceptible larger second outbreak fall winter, sparing Stockholm. fact, thought public health officials Sweden concerned winter resurgence? shit sucked covid sucks sure planet living since March, ridership significantly MTA losing money, it. Also, lot people still WFH ridership nowhere near before. wildest underestimates require 50% population infected herd immunity

Well according article dozen epidemiologists interviewed used 50% number, less, likely. Calling ""wild underestimates"" cannot known over- though certainly ""low"" estimates. estimates referred article much lower, including one 10-20% directly comparable assumes existing protection previous coronavirus colds. Respected Stockholm University mathemetician says 43%. varies region...rural Montana vs Manhattan live top people. another post, CEO largest vaccine producers said 15 billion doses (if everyone need 2 once) till 2024.  
If that's case reinfections may occur, well hell let's say every 6 months, that's two sets per year.  


Life fundamentally change. I'm sorry makes think control eliminate it. can't, stay, like flu. Smart people wear mask, social distance wash hands. Life know changed virus, sure. restrictions? Extremely unlikely. sure voted cheering. every right protect loved ones ESPECIALLY others clearly unwilling right thing. country less 10 million people, that's lot.

Stop always trying ‚Äúbe nice‚Äù. It‚Äôs deserved! goddamn ADHD make hard create maintain routine..  good. Keep up. change. Keep doing.

1. hard lockdown 67 days, allowing people leave home except picking grocery delivery

2. Set invasive contact tracing system world, people test positive unknown infection source get details movement announced public, close contacts tested placed mandatory isolation 

3. batch testing technology let test 11 million people couple weeks, needed

....it would surprising low numbers. believe numbers months ago, looking now, think numbers plausible: hide cases really effective contact tracing, both. OMG. hear you!! lost many friends family members simple masking. get problem is. But, saying ""F- you. care enough wear one.""  stand trying educate refusal even acknowledge science.

But nothing giving false data deaths cases try justify world. heard much regards covid, always heard one kid got chicken pox first time, bad (since really immune response) got was... really bad. Sometimes first infection it.

Well, compare probability recovered patients coming contact COVID positive people getting reinfected. next months might show us reinfection common rare. longer considered significant source spread, date confirmed case someone got infected surface. Note study use log scale decrease exponential time, scientists believe surfaces quite safe unless someone coughed past hour two, see Theoretically, hard time believing countries medical researchers would continue really bad. However could case bit grey area UK researchers tiny bit faster would normally be. mean completely ignoring medical ethics. means weighing cost potentially hurting someone trial cost letting covid run longer. 

So bad would continue, real way know countries might go ahead quicker others, depending assessment trial risk versus damage disease meant mask...not costumes. Everyone wear mask. Kids don‚Äôt deserve everything taken one year, Given duplicate records data, fuck no. totally related, country spends resources matters Well said internet person. know everyone rough right cant imagine trying balance kids coworkers talk joys space, want throw something them. following rules, mean really following live alone, means actual human contact better part year still months go. There's 15 minute escape change that. 

So may 3 us find balance see couple friends, reasonably. afaik Fall generally colder Spring Winter coming, along quite holidays. mean, 60 million people already it- including people care least- spread fast. That's kinda obvious. 6x number shots given. vaccine may require special handling. won‚Äôt dialed like flu shot.


Making distributing 600m ( 2 shots 300m ppl) anything complicated hard. 

Keep mind done 90m tests! shut transportation ambulances stopped picking people up. way survive going die home try treck hospital. shaking guy siezure.

Like Trump putting political pressure CDC FDA approve bogus treatments? live worst hit city right hospitals almost full people dying Ha ha HA HAAA &lt;-- That's University Georgia response. I'm pretty sure going ""maybe everyone gets it, one notice"" approach transparency. China, massive border conflict many worried could lead war. literally china numba one lol Nicely descriptive.. brought totally unrelated thread. said making people dig graves sick shit people support (in thread) disgusting, wrong? could possibly see incivility? none relevant. state law anyway Congress restricts free exercise time peaceably assembling. cannot go protest White House lawn Happy cake day! don‚Äôt believe anything say. cousins wife went rant kids Trick Treating regardless anyone says public health. got responses like ‚ÄúYou may want phrase better.‚Äù 100k allowed coaxed watching football game bar gf friends yesterday.

Can't even get people wear freaking mask public. P65 warning: flavor known State California cause cancer. First all, important note username called BaconWrappedEnigma. cool name. Second all, dont think reliable vaccine ready year, fuking flu virus mutates lot. yeah, ready weird terrible months(could years) ahead. Antibody tests late April suggested 20% NYC Coronavirus antibodies month everything shut down. 

In early days virus, people freaking r0 value, enough attention paid k value, variance. NYC get ravaged March took July Miami get ravaged even though Florida minimal restrictions 3 months prior? Lombardy get hit harder rest Italy Europe? seems like super spreaders huge driving force, idea super spreaders pop random. Exactly. happens state emergency open ended, end point given emergency suspensions rights? call emergency six months point? interesting questions me. There's something said targeted testing fast test turn around vs mass testing slow turn around. 20% great automatically mean there's ton infected contact tracing etc. gonna like movie contagion.... think hiding numbers due less testing, reporting deaths correctly. of, situation change dime? Agreed. Many factors play saying applies locale county county basis. Personally, eating inside restaurant vaccine coronavirus.

I get togo food meantime.

Same goes kind concert movie states dining months cases, hospitalizations, fatilities continue decrease.

and cases, hospitalizations fatalities decreased people places going eat church indoor concerts.

I mean study people test covid twice likely dined out. Yeah could lurking variable, know dining place spread.

anyway, saying stay closed, think makes sense NYC open restaurants limited way number theyre at.

I talking going comfortable. like answer. sense, opening schools pretend everything fine like putting Titanic's orchestra play people panic.


IMO, give shit orchestra point. happier relaxed captain turned rudder ice joined orchestra


I know emotional probably economical move, one worst possible ones.


To physically attend schools provide 
objective benefit kids compared homeschooling, nothing worths risk mass contagion health systems collapse


I agree might economical (and probably greedy) motivations behind


But even then, companies think twice. happen workforce became sick work 2 3 weeks? substantial part needed hospitalized needed take care hospitalized relative theirs? Without hospital bed left them


Even worst, would happen govt forced go back strict lockdown stocks plunged one time, like March?


Is really better business rather letting time employees take care children hours day over? reason trust anything coming Trump administration. Trump done everything undermine credibility America blatant it. Europe obviously far reliable. ... um.. post removed?

In truth, seems pretty clear many people good good long time, still are. individually, we're going decide committed we'll change. month? quarter? year? Hopefully change means going strict (see one) pretty good (see people believe safe ways generally) least bad (still wearing mask public, avoiding crowds, knowing carry risk see grandma) eventually *evolve* tune. Pass 2021 longer hate 2020 without imminent vaccine bet evolve lot.

Obviously everyone perfect (or perfect tomorrow), we'd much better spot. get it, 100 days something became apparent going happen least many people good months end, obvious time switch talk bad. Believing would get everyone modify majority life perpetually realistic. Believing could make happen without unified message support impacts caused along way, absurd.

If reading furious, ok, let's discuss understand rationalize sorts risk time too. Yes, yes, know, one different that's exactly point. something 50% less deadly ok brush off? 20%?

NDTV New Delhi TV, Indian TV channel. believe two things work. 

First given India-China tensions, Indian news channels recently become obsessed China. large Anti-China mood. 

Secondly Coronavirus approaching 100K cases day. India looking like could heaviest hit country world soon enough. Media naturally look someone else blame. Exactly thought. point, even want ridicule/make meme situation. hope guys fine see light end tunnel. Yeah China must held responsible well American citizens. Maybe we're also getting used doom gloom?

It going massive project. news shows adamant China protecting citizens. New York beaten virus 

A potential second wave would like word 3 years time, side effect hit like truck ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ California never spiked like FL TX. look normalized rate cases per day. California always around national average, whereas FL TX (and special mark shame AZ) sometimes much higher. addition, positivity rate never passed 8%, whereas got 18-30% aforementioned three states. numbers likely underestimates.

(In ways bad CA, think what's happened AZ, NYC, FL, etc. enough people immune virus given current social distancing/ masking practices, virus R0 dropped controlled.) Arrogance , that's is. foolish ignorance refusal learn others follow political ideology. Given number terrible adverts article, seems clickbait site.  Yes. find terrible propaganda incredible working home, neglecting negative aspects without taking consideration types jobs. mean, theoretically office jobs could done remotely, actual benefits it? Last week attended online conference organised every year presence. course done remotely. actually grasp benefit. One important aspect conferences networking part,which impossible online. So, followed seminars, everyone greeted, closed browser tab find alone room.

Hope I'm wrong. side effects? It‚Äôs double blinded. Can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs real saline solution. prevent deaths

With argument, could ban literally activity, forever. Big news! really, function immunity.

Declining case numbers mean 20 percent immunity. Haha right (see PM Justin trudeaus photos long ago)

Cities burning media tricked people thinking cops hate black people. get ratings it‚Äôs become narrative isn‚Äôt supported facts (hello two term black president, anti discrimination laws country history, richest average black population country) ""There two reports. first one come several days tell people evidence,"" 

Let's wait days then. Experts say multiply case county 8 24 get immunity.

The actual case count case count. mean many people think infected. know determine it, that's seroprevalence surveys.

My answer accept actual science referenced. stated march may factor found, mean convert case scientists used seroprevalence surveys, agree correct way measure found 20 percent immunity nationwide. border areas better nothing. actually going village tourist attraction. agree it‚Äôs correlation due ‚Äúlack safety concerns‚Äù.

I think it‚Äôs way around, IRL. That‚Äôs power loud minority.

That‚Äôs 1 60 chance. Fuck.  state lowering cases, that‚Äôs good. think average US cases also lowering, although still high Please say Yes, OK, China 3k dead 80 k cases, yes, OK, China, believe you. ""No that's happened. data cloth mask pretty darn effective.""

As long remember seen Chinees people walking around masks protect sickness. long Covid 19 'a thing'.

Yet needed 'data' know effective?
Really?
Are stupid living specie need others tell us data telling us instead learning humans need data know masks wear helpful sickness (any kind transmitted saliva) sure. Colds still suck though. hate society accept colds make almost effort minimise transmission. Why? invite people even come property touch/shed viral particles stuff? good confectionery industry?

I think Nestl√© cope. distribute vaccine produce it? take two years figure effective vaccine is, that's currently running trials for. Spot on!!! totally think did, sure people call conspiracy. necessarily manufactured, accidentally released. Every virus every organism mutates. nature genetic material. stopped many vaccines hugely successful. AFAIK vaccines found work still work long period. flu exception, coronavirus flu. Given lack proper news sites reporting this, I'm going go BS mean U.S lol wait flu season come. Rona supposed weak heat expected die summer maybe resurge winter.

Look now, one giant ass wave.  Depends mostly. state falling cases guy stand front grocery store actively block people masks entering. ""Corona hoax, wake sheeple"" yelled.  get feeling vaccines that's going happen. Xi already said Chinese vaccines ready prioritize getting ASEAN countries Africa. Obviously decision political economic reasoning behind it, hey someone first.  right. would interesting know ones wane earlier process would general one different everyone. Well, helped ""D day"", one asked make ""C day"" too. every case reported thoroughly massive tracing work. city live cases back, everybody knew details like worked been, gets published. 

If trying hide cases would cause explosion infections. issue comes people thinking sniffles+fever bad flu. 
Anyone influenza able tell bad really True! Nov 2019? think violates 'don't dick' criteria COVID-19 seasonal (not yet anyway). persistent.

It's demoralizing think everyone worn damn masks social distanced, would probably close it.  one look reviewers proudly proclaiming ignorance enough me. fucking idiots. can't wait see confusion little pea brains family get sick...but but....I thought hoax! *cough cough* patriot! *dies* don‚Äôt think is. university Illinois ok hiccup known positive kids going frat parties. They‚Äôve cracked positives shortened time results. test undergrads 2X per week grads staff get tested per week. done everywhere open colleges relatively safely.  Nobody said otherwise misinformation posting? Distance certainly important mask wearing. Plenty countries enforce mask mandates, keep numbers low recommending physical distancing. 

In America, people think put mask face, fuck around every two minutes, never wash them, etc., everything fine they're wearing mask. thoughtless. little public education around mask etiquette absurd. cant careful garbage.

Yeah, keep ignoring them. /s remember bulk cases centered around NYC, even concentrated specific boroughs. Overcrowded multi-family residences packed subways probably played role, also hit Tri-State region early pandemic. point ppl masking certainly social distancing avoiding indoor venues like today. Maybe Gov Cuomo shut state 2 weeks earlier half non-nursing home deaths would've avoided, would nearly impossible given finance &amp; commerce stakeholders wield power NY. picture documentary Americans going Peru drink llama sperm. Actually, comparing flu fine, flu serious, elderly, kids well.

If look many people die flu year, even *with* vaccine, imagine many would die year vaccine exist. give idea serious flu is, social distancing mask wearing could help preventing many flu deaths year, like covid. Yet none that, lockdowns, happened extent before. Maybe have, maybe we've lost plot days. Either way, we'll find many years, I'm sure many legitimate flu comparisons brought enquiries research goes tell us whether world's collective reaction covid justified. Depends work, usually people dont go running marathons immediately recovering flu... Ruling#? That's ""freedom"" associated totally ""free market"" propped time ""big government"". Fair enough, can't wait world successful vaccine, it'll interesting see whether west we'll use one's approved China. I'd happily take one available Finally someone said it. thing getting started. Mitigation slowed initial momentum, humans slacking mitigation real kick going come bang. 


People talking covid lockdown fatigue. still buildup boys go getting tired now. Hopefully isn‚Äôt long term damage players. athletes schools tested positive heart related issues. Yes Um....What? nice hear admittance slaves corporate entities within country. problem realize terrifying truly is. amuses grandpa's favorite candy. would even go way microwave gently got bit hard ""soften up"".

Both grandmother told ought throw whole bag trash.. that's nasty, inedible things belong.

But, reminded memory very, bad day, thanks pleasant memory. &lt;3 They‚Äôre Canadian like working diseased gorilla mauls try give free health care. Something like would take 5 years miracles happened. like 10 years. current climate, possible rushed 3 years I'd hope would making ridiculous exaggerations. exactly winning points entire pandemic. end till effective treatment, treatment comes 2027 means we'll Covid then. Maine health officials also said staff member Madison rehabilitation center, site four five deaths, attended event. [Well least link Dutch national health agency saying non-medical masks still let 40-80% virus carrying shorter recent one, wanted clearly said scientific evidence forcing people wear *non-medical* masks would help situation. Emphasis non-medical. 

Currently phone I'm going spend time looking exact studies referencing. 

I think saying Dutch government lying people, thus knowledgeably endangering them, strong claim. would put many people jail long time proven accurate. 

On top that, first wave Covid-19 worse Netherlands countries mandatory masks. countries mandatory masks similar upwards trajectory second wave Netherlands is.

I wish paid spread information government spreading already, like guy replied said. sadly I'm not. also trust researchers national health institute well, called sad another comment. Luckily one way tickets California super cheap right now. oh, thought began C ended CDC delineated constitutes good mask 'novelty' hole-ridden masks clearly qualify. Reported cases.

Here's reported deaths (also survivors deceased patients rehabilitation center. Oh welcome conversation. talking packing bars houseparties. things bring possible happening places control spread disease. Sure, it‚Äôs possible uncontrolled too, lot people dying time. 

Sweden high rate compared neighbors similar lifestyles overall health. Comparing country people healthy people (overweight, diabetes, etc) dishonest. pandemic sending masks free shipping cost you. prioritizing Healthcare essential workers. fantastic! want share hopefully let someone can't afford buy mask kids know it.  anti-mask. (S)he ia asking relevant questions. Asking questions asking specific much line science. WTF called ""patriot mask"".

Since patriots want willingly spread deadly virus already killed 200k people?

I guess that's rhetorical question, folks patriots. give shit country countrymen. daughter grooms poodle herself. cut men‚Äôs hair using dog shears lol, one wound looking like poodle. planning getting one early month, read effective received October it'll last worst flu season way. too. idea sentence means! Churches socially distanced (i.e. almost empty) require masks nowadays. Singing etc. irrelevant post-lockdown, alot even going now. 

I'm confused confused by. people crowding sorts places churches/synagogues places consistently labelled ""hot spots"" 

Not house parties, public transport, stores, restaurants, library, doctor's office, job. 

Do really think true sitting church 16X dangerous afortmentioned places?

I mean, 16X huge difference. even saying double ""more likely.""  good thing? young people get Covid closer get herd immunity. Young people rarely get sick Covid.

Just thinking loud. vaccine going covered copay ( signed CARES act ).

But paying taxes difference. 121? hundreds millions? died longer alive.  chart linked reported deaths. Here's animated chart backfilled deaths Florida Sept 11. List list, we‚Äôll always love you, ya goofy cheeseheads.  is?  would enforce cancelled? Ah. 100% empathize relatives friends rural areas... shoot. Half extended fam *had* COVID like fine whatnot theyve beach summer cousin goes Auburn lives campus hot mess hotness studies, actually! cycle 5 masks, using 1 specific mask day. Time alone sufficient. Although, leave mask car partially stinks less. Use mask physically degrading. try clean - filter better time *as long try clean it*. Cleaning causes degradation. citing personal accounts direct family. Facebook. must fun parties. well missouri loves company. Following footsteps former colony across pond. Always mutating too. It‚Äôs nobody cares people fine. Nobody cares long it‚Äôs happening them. explain smaller fraction deaths classified COVID. top 0.1% made record wins that's fine. Even EQ low. doubt try statement see happens.

‚ÄúWhile it‚Äôs obviously terrible send child school risk health pandemic, it‚Äôs even terrible parents choose sending school, taking homeless shelter.‚Äù not. background materials engineering. goal content twofold: 1) overview aerosol transmission; 2) good enough SEO pops interrupts sales cycles people selling products work. can‚Äôt prove wasn‚Äôt Samba! long upper middle-class WFH families fine nobody cares.  media created hellhole now. Despite making people think trump, *love* gives one, multiple headlines stories everyday he‚Äôs making tons money. 2016 happened large part media. handled pandemic bad government looking clicks ‚Äújuicy‚Äù stories. It‚Äôs disgusting injecting fear spreading disinformation Get tries control conclusions people drawing data]

Good luck that. make feel? think offering tickets games get tested. personal devices also probably made shitty conditions sweatshop labor, thanks capitalism. it‚Äôs either gonna get buried, marked point everyone able afford it. people call people ‚ÄúKaren‚Äôs‚Äù  This. go.

For example, vaccine HPV causes cervical cancer.

Edit: typop Thank goodness kids grown. would tough ex work kids young without day care schools. 

Even option open, let go either today. time ex essential jobs (she coordinator food plant, legal services) would felt right abandoning national emergency. might big problem financially, would tough moral, philosophical and/or logistics struggle. 

And raised one, know would colossally devastating, literally life threatening situation low income single parent, especially one lacking familial support system. grandmother even wear mask see daughter (high risk) 2 little grandkids (one high risk). SIL also high risk. 

To Grandma &amp; Grandpa, 
Will wear mask hour kids &amp; grandkids visit you? We'd like see new landscaping back yard.
Grandpa: Sure, problem! stay 6ft help remind kids start hug us take masks?
Grandma: thing give cancer! I'm sorry can't breathe thing!

It's kind ""I'm sorry"" tone means ""I'm sorry I'm pissed asked me. dare ask Anything benefit me! matter luck America faired poorly? South Korea faired well?  i'm long time anarchocommunist halloween always brings joy. Unfortunately, pretty much everyone fauci: antibodys actually cause cancer lmao news, treatment success strongly correlated reticulation splines. Even Oxford vaccine known effective duration 56 days, July.

Testing even close finished. people boats?

Not day goes don‚Äôt want opt-out feel like utterly alone. work alone, avoid family, see friends (they‚Äôre state). miss seeing faces. miss hearing friends voices. miss hobbies involve couch livingroom.

(scientifically required) environment Covid *literally* exact thing people suicidal ideation supposed avoid. going another year? means saying ‚Äúno‚Äù voice 365 times.

**AND**

My whole soul hurts. many people dead dying many people angry want help them? government abandoned us? whole planet seemingly fire, underwater, time? even people right side getting violent intentions? Taking joy deniers get sick die? humanity? can‚Äôt come together work clear obvious danger, going handle climate change? 

If I‚Äôm looking reasons hang closet, I‚Äôve definitely got choice litter. long upper middle-class WFH families fine nobody cares. true Hand candy distance using slingshot.

Who said that? school says keep children home ""they way unwell."" daughter Year 2 sore throat low fever, I'm keeping sister home passes. I'm following guidance letter, definitely feels like I'm one school so.  ""Are lawyer? tell lawyer"" 
""Hypothetically lawyer would way required disclose asked. hypothetical scenario asking lawyer happened lawyer......"" 
""Yup that's lawyer"" making good faith argument. point already addressed. Even heterogenous spread model that's used advance happy talk puts lower HIT 43%. 20%. seems slow people still staying away eachother voluntarily, born mobility data.

Related: wife travel US Canada week bury grandfather (died non-covid related causes) really like father her. Obviously upsetting, mention she‚Äôd cut last six months life.

Upon returning Canada, inquired whether negative test result would exempt mandatory 14 day quarantine. encouraged get tested felt anxious - especially symptoms - told negative test wouldn‚Äôt make difference regards mandatory self isolation. real reason given beyond ‚Äúit‚Äôs rules‚Äù.

Seems bit silly me, honest. acceptable necessary measure beginning pandemic really dark, you‚Äôd think there‚Äôd better solution screening disease. finding middle ground would least priority people need exit re-enter country non bullshit reasons test negative upon re-entry.

Hopefully rapid tests pan embraced Governments. matter leadership have. People going isolate 2 years. That's happening. blew chance contain March. We're definitely there, agree hard feel crazy look around see everyone else to. guy looks like Jerry Lewis Nutty Professor. colleges opened like 2 weeks ago

Good think college students don‚Äôt interact anyone projection said would 400,000 covid deaths January everyone mocked might far fetched. closing gap No.1 spot? electret layers important initial use cycles mask. degrade significantly unless attempt decontaminate them.  evidence suggest HIT much lower early predictions, I've provided bunch it. Denying existence make go away. statistically relevant, taking piss over-board panic? but... actually don‚Äôt,

[Yes do.] incredibly well documented. Memory upper respiratory (and intestinal) pathogens quite millions well within margin error.

4 confirmed sequencing, often think actually sequence virus? certainly far, far cases happening. Boy, last image really sums things up. Also looks like South Korea sitting 3.2% unemployment rate. Yes, Palestine doesn‚Äôt much tests Israel. statistically relevant, taking piss over-board panic? good points, makes appriciate even living single person household this. people small children must lot need alone time point..

and, make irony even bigger: what‚Äôs gonna happen notion *F√∂rbuds-Sverige* Denmark? nationwide numbers still going down. need strong firm leadership levels. *that* happening. Good science slow unfortunately. COVID-19 general population hearing types studies much earlier process usually do. mmmm watermelon Sure completely go away, many times heard ""This usual treatment/vaccine approved!""? Unless cabinet member course. Don‚Äôt worry - windows 10 fully backwards compatible dumpster fire. peer-reviewed study published Cell, large academic journal. So, know, actually true

Yikes... need inject skepticism digestion science think anything makes peer review inherently true result. residents dying nursing home without families ever getting say goodbye see months.

Yes - coronavirus sucks going different hardships saying losing time carefree really shows immaturity, college age entitled live world people expect instant gratification however, really can't happen worldwide pandemic. 

But seriously, could considered caviar problems compared far restricted. said, understand incredibly hard you. see lot residents suffering lack interaction makes sad. Spanish flu people killed INSIDE homes? flu scary enough, dude. Covid-19 even vaccine? vaccine literally Thanos Covid-19, like treatments, half assed herd immunity.  Yea, guess makes feel better. like Hong Kong's independence ever question...
Or another poster pointed out, like Alibaba owns based mainland China anyways... fine. filters actually get better become loaded, mechanical properties dominate time - *decontamination* process causes degradation.  i‚Äôve seeing meme circulate social media saying today ‚Äúmask free day‚Äù to...protest. protested? couldn‚Äôt tell you, guess dumb people want cause rally behind Thanks friend, too. pass time. far, reinfection rare cases think second infection milder. Maybe federal, states still employ data suppression. depends whether deaths making favorite candidate look bad. so, it‚Äôs fake. fooled once, I'm falling Jfc y‚Äôall. Uhm they‚Äôre called speedholes.

SAMPLE SIZE THO! ü§© Yes, staying sister's place week after. develop symptoms 7 days I'm confident infected. also get test.

Yes, realize small % become symptomatic 7 days, last time studied data seemed rare. ""self-quarantine"" kids feed; need work home; so, need take kids sitter/day-care; need go grocery shopping? Ah ok, makes sense me. thought meant like couple friends drinks park stuff like that. Thanks clarification! Yeah, super super work home office, they‚Äôre old-fashioned classical management style.

I sent home hours early, ended calling husband get ask work home. It‚Äôs already 5 days since exposure, there‚Äôs huge chance too. wanted keep coming got positive test would send home. think it‚Äôs better nip bud us quarantine time rather risk send entire office home. 

They eventually agreed he‚Äôs going quarantine in-laws going take dog since won‚Äôt able take walks dog park anything. going wash goes inside. Yes, kids live threatening danger. Yes shut school. That's snow days school. Here's one currently Phase 3 trials, may available treatment (100k doses) end 2020:

Phase 1: 2: 3: fact phase 3 promising see, means likely adverse affects. antibody fully human, makes sense. Additionally, likelihood works pretty high IMO. company developed antibody, AbCellera, ([according anonymous looking go public year, would likely timed coincide public release successful antibody treatment. seem confident effectiveness. Based studies lung damage heart damage, somewhere 10-50%. bad. sympathy rough time it, still happy successes. can't happy what's going right - else really look forward life? :)  know kids several schools, seem planning similar calendar - going online T-Day rather kids go home come back. think schools make Thanksgiving.

Jan/Feb wait see. Give Trump. really wants help fix ! üòé (co-Ed‚Äôs )  paywall Blame microtransaction model taken scientific research. Instead granted lots money study things long period time, people publish frequently order continue work. words always dangerous say, *probably* fine. Think many active infections exist fairly infected area.

The CDC can‚Äôt trusted‚Äîunless it‚Äôs something agree on

Anti-vaxxers dumbest people earth‚Äîunless it‚Äôs don‚Äôt trust Government one specific time entitled shit birds voluntarily attended? children die flu year. shut schools flu every year well? feel you. Sometimes feel like I'm running vapors is.  think goal point keep counting happy couple offs due media-induced guilt. Yeah ok, awesome Goya Beans ad like did?!  rick Shane? mean nothing. It‚Äôs US strategy: test, case. frat boys, tend go across US party College fraternities well Youtube/influencer types

More accurate say Youtubers frat boys call ""frat boy Youtubers"".

(Also two prominent NELK boys Canadian, matters all). B-cells produce neutralizing antibodies produce sterilizing immunity.

I actually agreed t-cell part, way phrased reply makes seem like contradicting yourself. transmit disease b-cells provide sterilizing immunity like said? make much sense me. experts better ideas blunt force trauma American way life???   Strange that, Yorkshireman prefer coffee... wonder disowned decade forced areas UK gods country told younger brother worried job legally cannot fire gets covid. live Oklahoma right work state. potentially lie him? sounds little strange me. better people outdoors? 

There rules big crowd allowed outdoors. think 100. less OK, not.

What police jacked actually enforcing - got impression much going counting many people place much lately.  Bezos richer good. Pregnancy test strips cost around $0.2 wholesale. rapid antigen tests essentially technology. Imagine everyone us took one tests morning. reproductive number virus would collapse...

Sometimes yes. also work closely individuals sign numerous death certificates. Wear surgical mask underneath.

That‚Äôs part hoaxer skeptic misinformation. assumptions incorrect.

That's fair. qualified statements. right, social distancing reason. probably population resistance. filter site mobility data. transit still universally baseline. Interestingly, many places see supposed ""natural"" resistance like Florida, states actually SLOWER returning back baseline retail grocery mobility vs. U.S. average.

I think it‚Äôs less attack you, ‚ÄòI want emphasize means little‚Äô establishing vocal consensus stuff works. What? Covid exploded rural areas weeks July 4th.

You act like someone testing positive automatically typhoid mary. Along lunatic protesters, using covid19 political tool, crap. (To put nicely) peoples lives harm's way. Enough agendas.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There's also difference way count cities. China's ""city"" name 2nd-level administrative division (along regional variant names). roughly corresponds concept ""metropolitan area"" ""greater X"" US. US think area ""suburb"" city, area would likely counted part administrative city region China, even US area technically belongs different township county. province China typically consists 10 15 cities. mean fair enough, also searching ""china"" comment history, get 208 results (admittedly, part part titles posts), allow assume impartial. anything, likely fly Business before. actually socially distance Business. Yeah, Stevens Point, WI. see doctor obvious symptons. Look 14 days vacate lack unemployment enough, also noise complaint somehow damage property. know damage, I'll find court. Wish money move.... grass India already short resources. Putting effort count dead may worth time. I'm talking specifically claim getting colds helps build immune system. know basics immune system works. Exposure baddies gives system chance learn fight said baddies, eventually might able destroy particular types baddies sight ever show faces again.

That's thing literally said - getting sick cold positive immune system.

From understand, getting cold improve immune system general. improves response particular strain cold. cold mutates much fighting one strain likely count much future.

But incredibly sure would love read source indicates otherwise. said, cases rising weeks weve yet see dramatic death figure. washable mask effectiveness equal N95?  terms American context there's already many anti-vaxxers rushing vaccine certainly help that. Even vaccine US might reach herd immunity anti vax movement degrading trust science rushed vaccine reduce number people willing get vaccine even recognize success Chinese government without absolute anti-democracy jerk pro-CPC.

Seriously, I'd say people West absolutely clue Chinese political system still see old old war mentality Mao era. Anyone curious research would least surprised ""oh, that's pretty interesting"" moment. company? amount youngsters roaming around without masks scary I've seen trend increasing city. Legooooo!! Huh? ICE camps, prisons, etc. concentration camps. Consultant working home till end year directives Govt. says would need go office.

so I. directives stop companies force employees work, result many companies forcing people work (or get saw huge gathering Poor people wanting go home, going foot, lockdown announced? Also schemes distribute free food announced still lot people gathered places causing spread.

Halloween subject.. 
I admit, so-called 'holiday' direct genuine enthusiasm toward every year. 
I've always gotten planning/throwing Halloween parties (for 'grownups') seeing everyone show uniquely good times. pisser year, 10.31 actually falls Saturday \*and\* coincides full moon. Even masks costumes, GF hosting party year. We're still discussing logistics *if* could way least accommodate trick treat kids, likely \*first\* year without Jack o' lanterns porch, vintage Beistle decorations extensive playlist Halloween-themed hard rock blasting out.  
Fucking Covid. Thanks lot immeasurable misery.  
A pox *still* taking shit seriously. long can't travel I'm fine honest, brought themselves, need fix it, we'll see next month america still chance democracy going full steam monarchy Thanks. looking first one, seems saying wfh on-site workers experiment, half switched randomly selected them. half wfh people switched back Interestingly, half switched, led gains WFH almost doubling 22%. highlights benefits learning selection effects adopting modern management practices like WFH.

If access full article, maybe clarify? seem studying pulling it. seems show people select work home productive working home. also reasons prefer office involve mental health, kids home.

The second link seem mention depression mental health.

As third, COVID, think people working site grocery stores burned out?

The last seems relevant link. reported complaints (from students, says) ones could make job, almost site COVID. manager gives feedback, end write home unpaid sometimes want something standard imagined time. get questions I'm working. relief given work-from-home time due COVID instead trying focus writing mask gloves makeshift socially distanced workstation.

The conclusion even relevant article seems mixed. also shows people work home say work affects positively. one shows significantly higher negativity appears people working remotely employer chosen location (such people go random people's homes).

None says work home chosen location bad people, even find bad. I'm right you. can't believe resistant people basic facts. science. There's room opinions. think we've gotten numb number deaths. think 1,200 people died Friday. projecting many deaths year equal Americans died WWII. That's crazy. Sigh. That's exactly thinking got trump elected first place. Americans fed steady diet corporate propaganda. Schools defunded, public services non-existent, social safety net. People struggling financially, communities left behind, poisoned (Flint, MI low income communities subject environmental racism). Mental health care often deferred (for-profit) prisons. It‚Äôs everyone since least Reagan era, reached Mad Max stage now.  see comment also part ""no exception"" hive mind. suspicious! part conspiracy?

But seriously: fact. need see conspiracy, China got results got making exception quarantine. US diplomats made fuss it, China put covid management rules. Good them. mean, *obviously* lying right? reduce r0 degree compensates enthusiastically many people obviously want infect everyone can, contributing factor.  used work several public pools younger. They're chlorinated, they're heavily chlorinated better overestimate underestimate. Much higher levels average private backyard pool think opinion piece fresh take anything. 

I also think anyone idea next couple months look like. even experts. personally think lockdowns happen again. mask wearing definitely kept up. important part, headline heroes start writing doomsday increase proportion stillbirths among hospital births caused COVID-19 infections, says K.C.. Rather, probably result pandemic affected access routine antenatal care, might otherwise picked complications lead stillbirth.

It's mothers missed regular checkups help find problems like umbilical cord wrapped around baby's neck, stuff like that.  Can‚Äôt please shut up. seen comment like 5-6 times already. 

Why can‚Äôt happy Sweden good numbers many people aren‚Äôt dying anymore. 

Nobody gloating. along though. Please stop. Thank much!  Yeah pretty low rate young people. Absolutely sad 121 young people died. Horrible nearly 200,000 died. getting little tired narrative I‚Äôm going die going gym eat.

And people still losing shit lockdowns wanting reopen, protesting playing politics. 


Meanwhile guys your... situation.  


It's really confusing. would thought there'd global perspective going around. Fox New - every word truth. Well, every individual word true, combine causes branch unreality. time, likely. take years. spanish flu everyone talks still strain influenza around today T-cells still around. Strange, totally pulled ass based early news said Russia China hacking Oxford others vaccine data Also cultural knowledge infectious diseases deal them. 

Lots countries well Covid-19 prepared ebola epidemic 2014.

Western people comparison academic knowledge deadly infectious diseases probably never personal experience them. vaccine magic bullet. take it, variety reasons. Vaccines also 100% effective. 

This sounds like treatment process - attacking virus directly - possibly someone vaccinated either directly exposed, starting show symptoms. 

Medical science multi-tiered. never depend One Answer. another tool (and first glance, good one), we're going say ""Nah, we're good"" probably vaccinet next 3-6 months. Yeah, that's thinking too. many cities/states want literally lose university cut slack taxes year? Given antibody tests show 10x amount confirmed cases, 14 percent sounds plausible. We're decorations music blasting since get lot trick treaters anyway. I'm going hand candy I'm high risk category I'm going (I decided yet) either hand candy bars wearing gloves mask etc behind medical curtain across porch entry (like crazy evil surgeon) I'm going hand bags chips dressed sort robot use one grabber things use reach stuff high shelf. live they've back school face face running around FL like there's nothing wrong anyway, I'm honestly concerned safety comes house.

""How come USA lost steel producition dominance"" go ""o man yeah, weird, I'd expect USA loose dominance this!"" read it.

In 2020 expect USA fail, type headline anachronistic. 

It's like headlining like ""How Bolivia become world leader submarine production?"". becomes funny, headline creates image guy really WONDERING SEARCHING come Bolivia top submarine tech. also funny think journalist really like ""Man must really investigate find problem USA's corona response!"". imagine like Jim Carey movie Dumb Dumber.

Ok missed that. Still horrendous.  Yep, can't even imagine damage Black Friday bring. 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! clarify think that's wrong unfair low income countries going likely bear burden disease much longer. Pieces like could highlight get people thinking disease burden don't. Except tried 60 cases ballooned 700 cases meant lockdown go longer harsher locked first place 60 cases. New Zealand locked day found first cases took 4 weeks get back zero again. Melbourne waited 3 weeks lockdown lockdown's gone 7 weeks get back 60 probably another 5 6 weeks left go. Every week wait lockdown another 2 3 weeks tacked onto lockdown. hey guys, remember half country likes go crazy made ""war christmas"" type bullshit? 
 
well, ain't seen nothing yet, hold butts. scientists say so. :( dangerous us. think reference Chernobyl. can‚Äôt jack lanterns? Watch, Florida's going first state 1,000,000 cases. like regular flu, BUTT WORSE!!!! Thats there's article praising published southern China morning post, right? know fact reinfection *not* common. evidence cases confirmed reinfection relation massive amount confirmed initial infections. recent study Iceland found 90% infected patients developed antibodies remained stable 4 month mark. T-cells last even longer seem confer kind protection well. 

And no, agree last statement. effective treatment vaccine is, say, 5 10 years road, choice go back normal. Humans meant live isolated other, able socialize freely interact. long time. That‚Äôs ridiculous. We‚Äôre supposed hide every future disease there‚Äôs vaccine available? It‚Äôs insanity. virus death rate healthy essentially 0. played part stayed home well 2 weeks flatten curve help weak frail. you‚Äôre weak stay home vaccine. you‚Äôre scared stay home. Stop restricting healthy going business. Nah Denmark put border controls 2015 2016 least Germany (first time life got stopped crossing internal EU border). 

Sweden put controls November impose temporary border controls try manage flow refugees, putting country‚Äôs infrastructure controls place long time - many times asked get Sweden. everybody change train Kastrup, something border controls Sweden made. go new train train stayed Sweden go Dk agree testing borders would great, needs much resources, personnel point even money (those border guards lab assistants want get paid ovetime well, tests cost money).

I think would SAVE money that. 

You catch one guy border, well can't infect 20 people 20 less people sick.

Even assuming fine, fact stay home work costs loads money. test cost like half day work. Sort related, company actually working hand hand 3M validate hydrogen peroxide sterilization N95s, say reason 3M refuses validate past 10 cycles nothing ability successfully sterilize masks. anticipate different.

All coin. look study? type vitamin found/provided supplements OTC. vitamin eventually converts blood, 7 days.

""The intervention group received calcifediol, type vitamin found blood. usual type vitamin found supplements.""

Not that, 1) overdose vitamin build bloodstream time, 2) max recommended dose vit 4000 IU daily, 3) vitamin supplement plus typical multivitamin plus 15 mins sun exposure day, way overshooting that.

Edit: clarify comment ... brought different type vitamin D, could interpret OC mean taking lot vitamin could ward COVID, case.

My concern handing flat statement ""one size fits all"" medical advice -- without knowing medical history, environment, diet, etc person receiving advice. potential overdosing vitamin there.

The best person receive medical advice doctor, knows medical history. Period Sounds like inheriting debt me...

You inherit debt, get much inheritance. Though readily available antibody tests still far easier participants trial unblind want vaccine trials. Hopefully don't. Viral load significance:

Like banned walks. make sun illegal? Like allowed go beach unless cram beach bar 50 people on. 

Other nations get focused rules squeeze extra money forget goal this.

We really tired now. Especially us small kids. people speak tired. Many forgotten marathon actually looking ways bypassing rules spends focus actual pandemic.

The big question chicken egg. Swedish people following rules rules make sense? rules making sense follow rules? know, China might virus first detected, instead origin. Considering know now, extensive asymptomatic spread goes cold chain, virus could going around world late 2019 hidden flu season. China made major mistakes except hindsight. Major Western countries initially rejected China's science-based response due longstanding yellow peril propaganda, obligated accuse China acting fast enough (which requires complete knowledge new virus discovery) distract population incompetence. admitted mistake apologized

Source? Congressional hearings Fauci defensive mask issue. 

His response mask questions was, ""Here go again..."" last thing wanted fly, air quality Portland bad choice book flight home.

In terms masking, I'm thinking cutting AC filter taping two cloth masks. Breathing probably suck, whatever. better mask could devise? Hospitals still weren‚Äôt overcrowded even re-opening.

Some South Cal counties go hospital capacity: hope win. argument nevertheless endless. location advanced production facility? generic drugs new vaccine maybe plagues issues even without potential production issues. 

It donation, still mighty big purchase huge leverages. country hand fate another right now? india's government ask sudden increase price? mighty nationalistic right now. use vaccine leverage demand favours? know, simple politics.  one president's guys accuse CDC planning coup? chinese government currently executing genocide definitely better US govt guys üòÉüëç regulatory body approves new medicines medical devices US healthcare *system* deals pricing access. like failing understand difference US patent *office*, *private company* selling patented invention. dumb. 

you digging heals making look smart, aggressive knowing talking LOL think contract tracers actually preventing disease? Y'all need read peoples' actual tracing experiences (the liberal) r/nyc. article alot speculation. people getting already contact bunch people. must PR effort make contact tracers seem worthwhile hired many hired #s nosedived

Also, we've 440,000 cases contacting 1300 people like really large enough # explain much percentage black people united states(13%). someone put picture bunch Americans prominent person photo would black person, statement ""This representative US population"" would interpreted racism problem black people. Nah, even 60% working vaccine vulnerable would end pandemic. try running hamster wheel mask! looking medical training public reddit forum, probably either find better resource organize curated collective people.

I appreciate work critically important field though. disagree completely appreciate assistance public health sector. Maybe he's Mike Tyson? taking account we've known issue since.........ohhhhh......... fucking February?

Still crickets. think line super spreader theories people presented. Basically, spikes occur subset people risky behavior move around (hence NYC large epicenter, due many people travel city). phase over, what's left people stay home types. point super spreaders stop spreading slows virus down. name antibody?

methods?

titers?

sample size?

control?

replicated study results? Bet can‚Äôt wait take masks! Wait true? know asymptomatic still spread virus... negative. spread virus? It‚Äôs community service. It‚Äôs supposed fun, certainly isn‚Äôt cruel. fact plenty people work willingly job. possess graph showing simple physics apply mesh size particle size concerns effectiveness masks, sorry tiger. Fauci says we‚Äôre still first surge pandemic.

Which is, itself, meaningless statement! number waves depends context. areas may never second wave. ah, got it. thank you! enforcement, crime, law. suggestion. think you‚Äôre healthy? Open door? Potentially get infected? get infected, hope didn‚Äôt pass family, co-workers, health compromised strangers... realized it? time though there's known cases reinfections mild disease (and probably neutralizing antibody responses) several cases resulted severe disease/hospitalization.  Past exposure absence strong neutralizing antibody response may may protective. Exactly! Thank saying this. keep seeing articles saying cases deaths down. Nope. It‚Äôs 1.6% right now. developed countries crosses 5%. Look logarithmic curve, spread less exponential. Gotta keep folks getting back lol heard another serious one: 

So maybe profile mild vs. serious cases reinfections. ADE thing even might relatively serious cases reinfections occur (lets hope not!). kick head asshole. Guys like come club demanding, groping, forget girls working ones making rules. Also many entitled people think treat us shitty treat customer service workers. independent means whatever fuck want. want risk assault charge dickhead will. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

Sooo guess question friends stuff women deserve kicked face. Versus lol, letting thousands restaurants go business putting families streets?  want explain talking 100% infection literally one is. pointed 60 million- many people take precautions- estimated it, lower r value based upon immune able spread it.

Why upset you? not. political. whole thread workers brought political softball hit around. Im surprised lack coverage India. 

They seem suffering quite bit never US media general  They‚Äôre using facial recognition software stores

To end? True. we're talking!!!!!! pay rideculous insurance gas prices? thanks! need ten fold increase get 20 percent. 

Good thing that's common estimate.

Stop weird anti-science. better freakin vote bad flu. 

They also changed ICU standards assign nurses patients before, kinda bad people discover **vitamin D3** doses **15,000 IUs above** work better, fewer negative side effects lots positive side effects, costs much less, available, used infectious disease, give fuck pharmaceutical companies say. Lmfao what? NYC continued public transportation throughout entire pandemic still decreased numbers.  pretty clear evidence doctors China detained government officials early November trying alert others virus. Well US shithole political economic capacity produce own. smoke still recent, didn‚Äôt affect hospitalizations. It‚Äôll definitely keep hospitalizations low next two weeks though P65 warning: Material P65 warning known state California cause cancer  One sources quoted used seroprevalence studies. derpie. clearly understand sources. fact matter estimates many, many cases what's confirmed.

there less 7 million cases. many, many big range. need ten fold increase get 20 like 60? 40

it's like. choose believe want believe. evidence says. seroprevalence studies common measure, others. point remains.

Yes, flatly wrong 20 percent americans immune. spread misinformation. We‚Äôre talking hundreds thousands restaurants, many sole livelihoods entire families. point it‚Äôs risk catching Covid go bankrupt end streets. Literally killing covid fire definitely American way want explain infectious disease work? Yeah, US probably imports bunch Indian Chinese scientist ""develop"" vaccine US Orlando confirm one cares. Besides industry outside vacation crap garbage. need $ cases city maharashtra 

Wrong, Pune  think discussion positive rate tests taken. think US parsed information much meaningless unless put everything together.  


We need know many tests done, positive rate test, chart time.  


But honestly, point, testing useless US want apply population. Without contact tracing coherent plan dealing positive cases, basically person tests positive right thing. 60 million people it, that's biggest reason accept it. seroprevlance studies come close outside around NYC. Ride wave finish line. Yep, TV shows people hug strangers stuff Unfortunately backing another vaccine released voting starts, many health officials said ready then. I've also lost friends, me, suddenly decided anti-BLM fuckin' nowhere. worst guy who's friend 25 years. hell suddenly become racist cunt? 

He starting premise ""Black lives matter"" ""I like way handled"" anything like that. could handle that. just... guess black lives never mattered him. 

We talked since honestly think ever again. could ever look again?  something said based presumptions long lock time? Covid data comes states, state reports data well. Johns Hopkins aggregates data, big conspiracy reduce cases, would quickly noticed. pay view though. youre wrong. Also include elderly-immunocompromised population assisted living / skilled mursing facilities need go often. Positivity rate well. You‚Äôd see increased rate testing reduced much. We‚Äôve tried nothing we‚Äôre ideas. Ivor Cummins

 Sick misleading replies trick people spreading conspiracy theories more. mentally draining past months lockdown Melbourne. Can‚Äôt imagine would places far worse situations. 

I think targets open far unrealistic well. can‚Äôt see us getting five cases anytime soon, let alone sustaining fourteen days. Man, CDC high ass hopes us U.S.

There‚Äôs punch line this, really dropped ball hoping fall states like Florida, Alabama Georgia? wasn‚Äôt considered real like July people still think told dress ninja oppressive, couldn‚Äôt walk bank mask before..... seems like bonus Yeah. expected countries many young people. disease mainly targets old people. translate mobile, see perfectly go reply! Mask use poor? It‚Äôs 85 cases less months ago. Unless massive spikes cases, deaths aren‚Äôt going rise either. So, everyone living people arent taking precautions wearing masks?

Im asking live Oklahoma. Normally people freedom choice right refuse mandates government. But, everyone see wearing mask everywhere go. arent half assed wearing either, like would think. seriously thought people got tired shit would say fuck quit wearing them, arent. 

I understand college kids stupid instances parties stuff, out, one wearing mask around others.

Where guys living see one wearing them? TV personal experience. curious. Reminds comedian Lewis Black‚Äôs candy corn monologue. Everyone likes you. Ah yes worse prison state I‚Äôm sure make everything better. terrible suggestion Thought flatten curve....  food/water shown vector covid? Far know really hasn‚Äôt, chlorine would probably pretty bad virus. drug that's discovered late? still go trials etc. 

Meanwhile vaccine's 6months away.

Edit:Sorry, guess I'll downvote point. secret ingredient inside: Honey  Wow, Sweden *still* visitation bans? old Sweden can't easy... First massive death count, lengthy lonelyness :/ I'm really looking forward flu season people start getting sick, start getting better, claim covid bad. said 45 lmao First 7th grader arrives gets jackpot takes entire bowl candy. Personally think types drugs prophylactics therapy way likely successful vaccine. 

I hope works.

Edit: reflect ""this drug"" prophylactic read article. Gotta get crown ...

Oh god, he's right, guys. mean entire country death rates like ny/nj March didn‚Äôt quarantine them. Hmmmm burn Sweden, thought prevalence antibodies people low, indicating something else work herd immunity. Yes, look [hard facts skip ~24 minutes) stop panicking. Agree. Although happy people easily overreact, think take risks seriously enough.

I think heading next Corona peak fall. birthday Halloween 32 years (this year) life never missed trick treating. year first time kids go out. Yer years, spanky. AIDS fully hit USA already sexually active. think like this: plenty could done, wasn't. 

And America wants sigh, clap dust hands, say ""nothing done"" forget it. 

Lots *could* done, there. downright third world shittily everyone power America populace eating kind shit up. 

You think shit means something young. coworker planning visit parents week husband go back in-person work. parents agreed quarantine two weeks leading visit. 

The day supposed come, father went mask-less Home Depot stopped friends house. 

They didn‚Äôt end visiting  take much.

This vitamin C worst case scenario get runs.

I'd stay 2000 IU day.  think salaries warranted though? Sort like athletes...high pay financial balances think get ‚Äúbuddies‚Äù enjoys funds can
Spread around ?

I know quite administrators work hard (or least seem to) even get along rest Staff still can‚Äôt seem figure do!

The thing know skilled ‚Äúcorporate politics‚Äù Oh believe voting even polls say Trump 20 points. I've everything right since March. stay inside day over. Grocery shop weekly, occasionally visit people keep limited. I'm frustrated matter virus still spreading. everyone moved living up. fiance's parents went sudden trip Florida -- airports, beaches, hotels restaurants. mid 60s. got back immediately invited us over. told fiance wait 14 days. responsible ones older people take risks. I'm tired timeline. Unnecessary risks. stay inside. don‚Äôt want to.

Edit: = ""omg like LITERALLY can't stay inside longer.‚Äù think weird conspiracy guy replying peddling dumb misinformed claim think worth considering China relative countries instead ""they would done better countries running normal"". assume China interest becoming leading superpower world (not far-fetched assumption) may happy covid-19 simply less bad competition. Even coronavirus stunted Chinese economy hurt Russian US economies could beneficial long run.

I'm informed enough world economies really say occured given dealt virus earlier, ability use much stricter/more effectively enforced antivirus measures think possibility.

Again sincerely believe China made tried spread/export virus point China might actually benefit terms status world superpower worth thinking about, quite interesting imo someone help understand vaccines long term adverse events? always assumed since you‚Äôre injected part virus (either dead, weakened RNA), meant worry duration said virus, max. biggest concern hypersensitivity like anaphylaxis. 

What vaccine point, months later, virus couldn‚Äôt? 

Also, someone frail experience adverse reactions incomplete virus, mean likely would‚Äôve died caught real thing? Don‚Äôt come house, unless kids looking hand sanitizer masks I'm sure ever seen Halloween US, I'd think know otherwise, winds happening kids take mask sucks walk around night. Plus every person trick r treating going mask part costume. fact, probably won't. can't really rely that. It‚Äôs definitely regional, part problem. Everything super disjointed. I‚Äôm New Jersey everyone‚Äôs masked up. Took kids park Saturday literally EVERYONE wearing mask, even kids. family Florida says one wearing mask. issue run mill scientist employee. chugging along normal (albeit, lot stressed demoralized) part. good news least one way: way vaccine ready election, way mandated taken. 

Any vaccine released January 20th well documented testing history. Sure, what's released public Trump probably severely (criminally) edited, cant delete source material, political appointees go deep organizations. 

So... yeah, vote Trump like life depends it... does. sister husband take kids town pool like 3 days fucking week. think I‚Äôm asshole say that‚Äôs disgusting. It‚Äôs fucking Covid Soup. 
4000 IU might bit much.

I personally stay 2000 IU (1000 multi-vitamin supplement).

Too much vitamin result calcification joints want that! Interesting. definitely one concerns. production vaccines take time.

I remember (a years ago) even make enough flu vaccines.  already worked out.

I'm trying downer, none things everyone waiting sound realistic me. US mask use fairly love capitalism? Nothing gets excited potentially going broke, becoming homeless, becoming unperson dare care health. Already trying depressed Christmas... September. Sigh.

I feel this. :( Christmastime NYC *usually* favorite time year wonderful place (IMO, obviously), year somehow doubt festive...  Choices. doubt Mr. hurry approve ""China vaccine"" ""China flu"" Go feet outside Perimeter see many even skip required. Costco started ok, see least 3 4 people pulled chins every time go. least per trip, man wearing one all. always man, he's always got smug look like he's itching get confrontation it. He's always wearing black size XXL tshirt sort obnoxious slogan it, know owns least 3 them. saw discussion patterns wrt progression Spanish flu north south hemispheres, wasn‚Äôt able find source wanted one later. source patterns you‚Äôre demonstrating respective locations? Thanks Patios don‚Äôt seem terrible, I‚Äôve case-by-case it. Masks + tables sufficiently far apart seems pretty low risk, and, thread highlighting, legitimately can‚Äôt stay inside indefinitely, especially winter coming Maybe aren‚Äôt. am. Wow. seem mad. So... sounds interesting, potentially life saving. doubt anything like researched tested time useful Covid-19.

That said, could extremely valuable research moving forward terms treating preventing flu, assuming research applies coronaviruses. Maybe, we're really lucky, find ways prevent treat kinds viruses too...? would pretty awesome. draw line done necessary save many lives possible. says never going vaccine, never go away? sentiments backed widely agreed upon facts. 

The reality still lot air due new virus is, making blanket, absolute statements anyone good. know article came today, looks like might STILL meddling CDC reports. like think new deal style jobs program. Much like paying ditch diggers, another crew come paying fill ditch. like rocking chair pays better.

I can't see one could see much real effect random person bot alien internet. Kids don‚Äôt care shit first weeks. long intend keep kids home? kids? point go out. Say there‚Äôs never vaccine (which likely not) what!? can't reuse masks? load disposable ones switch thorough (if I've left week more)  California. regulate much flavor fast food allowed have. French fries taste there. go SLC flight tongue literally burns ingredients used. think much mask fragility young man. Drinking 2 liters seawater directly every day fine people already consume salt many sources. problem restricted USA, bad situation is. good reason distrust 'miracles' (to borrow word certain lifelong con man said disease would disappear like 'miracle') Russia, China India. reasons vary amongst lineup, viewed caution. particular vaccine something personally confident Oxford connection. bad. Yeah I'm going come straight say lying. Hey, yeah, AWG stands american wire gauge. standard wire sizes electronics. view chart (the diameter chart bare wire without said I'm using 22 AWG since access bunch it. found one strand strong enough twisted two together using couple pairs pliers twist tightly come undone mask. look like this:

Before: want use **solid core** wire. also stranded wire, stranded flexible good application. want rigidity solid core wire. There's insulation outside wire. left insulation seems work well. found nice kinda hook glasses wire. leave insulation make sure use wire white coloured insulation. Originally put green wire inside light coloured mask. dye insulation ended leaching fabric bit washed.

You could maybe use single strand slightly heavier gauge wire like 20 AWG maybe 18 AWG spend time twisting wires together. I'm sure would work best. I've tried two strands 22 AWG twisted together since that's readily available.

Here's amazon link sort wire many masks making, buy larger spools wire. spool linked 25ft. buy 100ft spools work. used 3"" lengths wire mask.

Let know questions! happens Sweden‚Äôs cases start going again? Good thing Canada virtually crime-free, near zero riff-raff.

God, admire Y'all. I‚Äôll trust American CDC FDA, personally yeah right I'm shocked.

We'll.....not shocked. restrictions way ridiculous. Time open things back won‚Äôt businesses left. Especially LA County. absolute garbage expect cases isn‚Äôt vaccine. one knows IFR personally think that's low. United States CDC gave latest estimate 0.65%, around I've thinking. 

Some day, we'll know, suppose. thinking day. we've similarly following rules given week never maskless around someone else inside, rarely even outside, work home, go much, etc basically zero risk. 

if drove ""home"" immediately hugged 10 oldest relatives have, would minimal risk them. 

if hung one extra person week wife, trip home, risk would probably multiply 100x actual risk would still low, much lower adult children visiting daily bring food washing. Nice username funny media mentioning fact also exempt Sturgeon's Scotland. pandemic over, quality funding country's education definitely needs looked at. Vaccination. Actual herd immunity mass vaccinations. laid clearly time ago USA manipulating data soon control taken away CDC, Trumps constant talking testing make numbers look better.

&amp;#x200B;

Expecting better USA nuts man.

They cant even maintain treaty/deal...lol!! 24 (and moonlighting resident DJ local prominent nightclub) caught nasty stomach virus left statistically unlikely chronic post-viral dysautonomia syndrome debilitating basically unable leave house hours, difficulty eating anything let alone going food, give drinking entirely spent two years sorry state gradually (over course another 5 years) becoming well enough resume life 85% normal (I‚Äôm 99.9% days occasional flair ups I‚Äôve learned deal with, thanks wondering... mostly worry hips tight hurting back sitting digress). time applied, accepted, graduated masters program, multiple girlfriends, took new hobbies learned new crafts, found career lucrative industry I‚Äôve worked almost decade.

Everyone busy lives. 

So understand create false dilemma you‚Äôve laid lived experience even greater degree little sympathy 20-somethings find current social distancing guidelines untenable months god forbid years. Read book, start new multiplayer video game, organize life set goal. 

Now, never said think people lock inside houses never come out, said I, *me*, take risk don‚Äôt to. That‚Äôs wear full face P100 respirator go grocery shopping (one benefits worked BSL-3 environment respiratory protection gear). I‚Äôve seen idiots around share lack understanding respect potential consequences likelihood can‚Äôt trust engage behavior protect me. isn‚Äôt first rodeo, account know I‚Äôll fine. don‚Äôt go around telling people smoke cigarettes don‚Äôt tell people live lives pandemic, free whatever hell want long doesn‚Äôt impact me‚Äî freedoms end mine begin. directly answer question, ‚Äúdo expect millions like [social distance] we‚Äôre 30?‚Äù answer resounding ‚Äúyou‚Äôre even now, course not.‚Äù mean aren‚Äôt incredibly reckless better understanding risk present around do? fucking course not! You‚Äôre acting like bunch spoiled babies can‚Äôt take ‚Äúno‚Äù answer, people want ruin fun isn‚Äôt serious matter public health. Everyone wants virus gone, it‚Äôs people can‚Äôt follow basic safety precautions prolonged current state things. guys worst enemy... everyone else‚Äôs worst enemy too. spread occurring among young people. 

I‚Äôll give high level overview corporate America expects ‚Äúendgame‚Äù covid. Vaccine approved 1H 2021, public rollout vaccine second half year likely 2022. likely similar efficacy flu vaccine require two shots uptake 40% least first rounds. seasonal virus. We‚Äôll likely develop new therapeutics (or least repurpose older therapies) reduce mortality among hospitalizations half. years we‚Äôll see inherent R0 come population exposed develops innate immunity. It‚Äôs impossible say much it‚Äôs impossible qualify immunity strength duration current data. virus going us foreseeable future remain threatening least years unless there‚Äôs paradigm shift effort track trace contain. US track cross 1M deaths 2022 isn‚Äôt surprising realize population kind comorbidity (particularly obesity asthma). 

So yeah, going us you‚Äôre trouble now, imagine hard it‚Äôs going time next year. According aggregate auto insurance data average customer files accidental coverage every ~17 years. many miles one drive 17 years? majority accidents non-fatal. covid, chance catching virus dependent environment, time spend there, protection have. far likely catch COVID get auto accident. Except 0.7% auto accidents fatal, 1% chance ending dead chronic bad health catch covid. likely catch covid auto accident, you‚Äôre also likely suffer death long term consequences COVID auto accident. That‚Äôs point. whatever want don‚Äôt pretend it‚Äôs unnecessarily stupid risky. get it, inside bums out... I‚Äôd rather bored depressed suffer chronic illness say someone lived realities. 

There it. Back work. *not* alternative facts *or* alternative truths. **This editing creation whole new facts.**

Lets go far road. people alter scientific data political reasons people die. plenty people intubated said would refuse again. agree you. would rather die end tubed breathing machine. 1/3 chance long term complications ICU stay.

To keep alive ICU, basically torture you. sleep, food, etc. suctioned, RT squirts saline throat. feel like drowning. cough water up. comparable waterboarded. I'd rather die go that. admit Sweden right comes getting mayhem way early avoiding resurgence? Look Spain, France, UK. surging again. Denmark surge. sub admit looks like Sweden got thing control constantly worry shutting everytime case pops up. Belgium denmark know two numbers related, right? [The retailer defended technology‚Äôs use, saying nothing race intended deter theft protect staff customers violence.  depends vaccine wins whether works pocket Big Virus? something? 

At least older conspiracy theories tried make sense. ""conspiracism"" - conspiracy without theory.  honestly i'd look whatever best kind masks use bad air quality use instead covid specific one Tell junkie neighbours, I'm sure they'll civil conversation. lol

We leader pretending like pandemic exist fuck think leadership making production capacity coming from? agree, certainly could make sufficient quantity N95s entirety US gave shit. that's reality live in. Nobody asked me. Fuck Caputo he‚Äôs piece excrement. [are really sure #notruescotsman

Can call developing nation? certainly ""serious academic"" would define ""first-world nation"", it? Definitely illegal protests ok? looks like needs help. well funded social services maybe would happened  also know could asymptomatic carrier infector diesease article. yeah might wanna sit one out. Guess I'll stuck 20 person gatherings(my countied limit) 2024! RemindMe! 1 year

We get - hate America. edgy. that's unrelated shitting FDA understand FDA is. keep changing tactics yes get it. America bad, wherever from, good. Yes agree people must social distance wear mask cloth face covering! yet people still support believe lies spreads caused thousands die. Fuck kids? I‚Äôm guessing no. Pigmented skin absorbs less sunlight produces less Vitamin D. Black people likely get COVID.

I wonder controlled this. Cause conclusion merely black people likely get COVID.. already knew that.  Okay, trying say clear all. accusing ""just flu"" person. sure got that.

When said ""treat like flu,"" Im sure take ""Do basically nothing stay home symptomatic (sometimes, unless boss dick)""

So mean? dont understand whats hard following guidlines! friends 20 person maskless gatherings counties limit! People breaking guidelines reason get covid! New York never second case spike though. Deaths lag 1-2 months. Fauci said Anthony Fauci, nation's top infectious disease expert, regret telling Americans wearing masks Tuesday House Energy Commerce Committee, Fauci explained situation different months regret let explain happened. time, paucity equipment health care providers needed ‚Äî put daily harm's way taking care people ill. want divert masks PPE away them, used people,‚Äù said. blinded pressure eyes, etc.

Will ever get vision back? They've made atomic bomb nothing like 3 years. buy millisecond machinery China replicable 10 months.  

I would understand super advanced metallurgy, purpose hamstrung Jared whoever. Guess Covid care. ok protests ok fans sports kids trick treating  think Christmas huge cut point lot people wether vaccine not. It‚Äôs making coronavirus manageable like illnesses. Mental fatigue, people generally care less goes on. also consider mental health; can‚Äôt stop youth say, dating, months months potentially years it‚Äôs unfair. Brazil US similar right deaths per capita. explains lot country. I‚Äôm sure understand comment. higher UI benefits decent wage standard. problem congress thought pandemic would much sooner. Oops. don‚Äôt even aunt...but still didn‚Äôt answer question ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è American elections farce whole world endure?

edit: act like U.S. something plutocracy

I‚Äôm saying perfect, government actually put lot money peoples hands far it‚Äôs bearing economic data. long don‚Äôt let lapse (oh shit, late) Four one nursing home.

Sounds like ""WE ISOLATE AT-RISK!!!"" people yelling, never real plan. Seriously honestly believe HAMAS top notch science based public health policy completely fucking delusional. hope CCP least pays well (*tips hat*) guy dad knew died heart attack mowing lawn two weeks getting covid.  Death COVID norm...there nothing done vaccine developed distributed. article refers US government's response, depends people vote November. delusional. read it? Excess deaths Brazil 10% higher COVID deaths Aug 1st, way lesser European countries. 
Edit: New week, Brazil: **Aug 8th**: 114,224 excess deaths, 100,543 [COVID Awesome!

Prayers synagogues allowed!!! extremely ridiculous restrictions nobody really comply allowed people follow every single part protocol.

While normal people can't go cities, rabi horn (which used blow religious ceremonies) allowed move cities.

You're allowed go beach allowed enter water. (No, parody joke, actual part restrictions written morons refuse listen medical experts).

Public pools closed, except mikveh, open restrictions enforced.

Schools closed, however, yeshivas religious schools also happen one biggest coronavirus infection drivers, remain open (this stated media, actually know someone working there)

While would've supported real lockdown, I'm absolutely furious current restrictions. written politicians health experts. Take easy boss it‚Äôs quesyoon repercussions Putin bounties US soldiers, etc etc

But, can't stress enough, stocks up. It‚Äôs hyperbolic it‚Äôs basically becoming hermit even vaccine released. Phase II testing complete without significant issues far know.

Why pushing idea majority mothers sending children back school sit around drunk? There's also theory infectious disease rampant there, there's higher chance semblance immunity already. Pretty soon every house could real haunted house? NYPD start wearing masks try enforce anything? almost NEVER see NYPD masked up. 9/11 last week swarms cops everywhere understandably. single mask them. events congregating outdoor dining areas standing around maskless drinking. city regulations. It‚Äôs infuriating. Same. deep resentment towards people act now. commented another post still stunned they‚Äôre going **second** full lockdown. Israel developed country, (or can‚Äôt) afford this, much developed country (or can‚Äôt).

The political balls shocked, fact coalition even so. county religious groups explicit political standing, it‚Äôs really good see following science. one guy government form religious group prohibiting prayer gathering such, ended resigning.

Also country going internal political turmoil, fact unite enough pull wow me.

Edit add: lockdown begins right jewish holidays begin (rosh hashana jewish new years, kippur sukkot) public holidays there. everybody families traveling. It‚Äôs like opposite Wuhan - instead locking *after* Chinese New Years, they‚Äôre before. 

At least everybody notice prepared stay locked wherever holidays. Full face masks made latex, yes.

Permiable cloth paper masks cover eyes even comparable. OP panicky upvotes... sure check out. Well done US worst world!

But, according Fauci entirely likely enough Americans take vaccine herd immunity occur: Europe thousands years old, EU political concept existed since 1970s. UK always part Europe. Post viral issues rare, children, Covid-19 occurs in. Yep. Good point. ""Anyone pokes head foxhole gets priority charging enemy lines""

I wanted say good luck, we're counting you. personal position government mandated colleges go remote-only provided deficit-funded aid keep schools local communities afloat year.

But it‚Äôs real easy talk government policies been. level support didn‚Äôt come, it‚Äôs clear would never come since least May.

[edit] nice day. comment history shows flat-out COVID denier. Prob Easter repeatedly said things like cases, they're getting better, we'll zero soon, know fact made fake projections, sitting intel refused release showed exact opposite.

Grow up. 

He's absolutely right. COULD shoot someone 5th avenue, would shortage people saw broad daylight would pretend happen simultaneously demonizing whoever shot.

It's mental illness. Well thank goodness listen *them.* Case fatality pretty worthless though sorry hear sad lot easier said done  would love someone explain exactly supposed see happen get back normal. 6 months two weeks ""two weeks flatten curve."" Nobody set specific metric getting back normal. impossible reach goal even know location goal. researching possible therapies hope agenda?  many hospitalizations?

Good Mr. A. üëèüèº virus becomes part everyday existence decades, much like flu, great additional arsenal it. Tamiflu aid Flu even though yearly vaccines.

If assume vaccine partially effective, 1-2 punch stop outbreaks spreading highly necessary.

The ideal world would everyone gets vaccine. Anyone suffering suspected covid symptoms goes Dr get rapid test prescribed drug like this. Depending trials go, could possible sick person would quarantine starting medicine. College towns. party, leads hundreds positive test results, though hospitalizations much less deaths, local populations freak out. around around go. like rereading everything I‚Äôve right since Day 1. obviously targeted people 4th grade reading level....hmm, wonder might be. genuine response please note trying mean all. 

I think implying believe science kind religion blindly follow. Bachelor Science Biology top 10 US public Uni produce multi 6 figures self employed (I work science though). 

I know better blindly believe narratives use incredible tool science benefit. truth is, science find evidence sides narrative truly knew scope science also limitations would know better blindly believe everything someone somewhere says ""science says this!!!1111"" ultimate truth set stone forever. Science always leaves room new explanations.

For example, bunch studies (actual legit sourced studies showing lack efficacy masks): real science well, peer reviewed studies (some CDC itself), unfounded claims. ignored?

Does mean wear mask required? No, err side caution respectful others anyway plus feel like big deal put fight mask, cares. chance help studies wrong (see, ultimate truth likely middle), maybe help.

Am saying virus real potentially harmful certain subset population? No, all.

There many well respected physicians scientists questioning scope tests well lockdown effects compared actual virus effects, voices would see news reason, why? know right now.

Here lesson you- brainwashed believe narrative blindly media, may true, average person lacks context know ultimate truth claiming moral superiority saying anyone living FEAR like ""anti-science"" feel superior. need live Fear, understand things reality science yet prove would realize literal worst thing flood consciousness with. Agreed. (Unfortunately think right). Haha missed part. principle still applies. Infection rate tests still high. Yet Sweden's deaths per capita still lower Spain's UK's. latter two middle second (if smaller) wave, clearly developed (full) herd immunity, could Sweden already? That's I'm conveying. see deleted previous comments can't handle disagreement. I‚Äôve grinding gym since opened finally back pre-corona strength. feel 100x better March - Mid July.

Keep wearing masks y‚Äôall. Many countries publish data regularly. know real number, entire world, we'll probably wait couple years. Oh, cause great deal harm taking money problem solvers. feel like, sun kill uv rays. Come fall, less sun clouds, higher chance outside transmission already seeing results. science seems apparent me. like Americans cannot grasp concept global supply chain all.

Or global health care! Ha ha we're morons. sister literally wedding 100+ people refuses mandate masks social distancing. attending. think explain: Opening restaurants NY fine Cuomo already killed seniors ‚Äúbeat virus‚Äù

Opening restaurants Texas Florida, however, outright murder. hope allowed wear mask long wish. know. planned large house party.  serious investigation done trial keeps chugging Yikes. &amp; Ms Hell, games even played.  ""longer"" means extra month, okay, maybe that's big deal. means extra year, catastrophic. I've noticed people seem confusing antibodies T-cell response. Like seem think antibodies gone, immunity? terrifying thought. data one trust? gut instinct? lol I've seen stuff. Sounds good me. Thanks won!! We're maybe talking ""a few"" **student** deaths, considering faculty staff, older family members/members community.

If value human life see productive discussion. option Jean-Paul Sartre philosophical sense, realistic one anybody right mind consider. Yes. Lol yeah it‚Äôs easy say you‚Äôve already Moms basement 5 years üòÜ I'm unbelievably pissed can't Halloween chucklefucks wear mask.

&amp;#x200B;

Halloween year going Saturday, full moon, literally blue moon. 2,576 cases last seven days. Like pretty much everything pertaining this, think depends person virus itself. Unless immunocompromised, body really ""forget"" fight virus already (the flu common cold coronaviruses different usually changes season season.)

The big concern keep hearing covid could mutate and/or become seasonal, point bodies might recognize exposed it, know likely problem. Generally speaking, unlike every horror movie ever seen, viruses tend become *less* strong mutate. Doesn‚Äôt change they‚Äôre pansies. asked social distance? Even age bracket? Mark words then. place like reopened think making good decision hope wife stays safe! I'm similar boat asked part wedding party last November wedding next month. think time tough talk bride. Mother 7 here. Let try explain particularly hard kids home full time.

-children playing together fun. Wrestling, playing tag, playing pretend, throwing things other. adult really don‚Äôt enjoy things becomes exhausting.

-my home isn‚Äôt gym. don‚Äôt wide open spaces kids run, things breakable school, don‚Äôt sporting equipment. reason schools things kids need thrive using them. 

-my home meals sleeping. blessed enough room everyone bed, enough room clothes, reasonably large kitchen living room. don‚Äôt individual spaces solitary learning, takes tremendous amount energy keep kids driving (or myself) batty. times I‚Äôve sent kids go sit car alone time. It‚Äôs hard describe need adult alone time you‚Äôve lived constant inescapable presence several kids 6 months. 

-routines. weekly activities gave week shape rhythm. don‚Äôt even many activities, Sundays busy, Wednesday nights busy, Friday nights often date nights, Saturdays sports. Without activities feels like one long endless trudge. Likewise, ‚Äúshape‚Äù year. hard get excited ‚Äúsleeping in‚Äù home summer already 3 months; it‚Äôs hard make ‚Äúback school‚Äù exciting transition. normal holidays cancelled even lackluster. 
These missed events hard adults too, kids creates build frustration, unused energy, emotion.

So, parents already mental illness, bad parenting skills, particularly tough child (special needs) situation (lost wages, illness, bad marriage) pushed breaking point. I‚Äôm excusing behavior, trying explain triggers are. Sharia stops spread virus, that's implement. saves one life... pretend like hundreds thousands dying, though, matter actually happening. 

-Supporters current president. cycle complete... like it, like much else. really nostalgia thing players 23+.  Jesus... first graph article proves claim bullshit. Look tail end... currently Sweden's cases per million higher late July early September.

The latest data FHM 7-Day Average 228 14/9/2020 200 last week. March 13, rolling 7-day average 111 cases per day, lower since then.

This article complete trash. can't believe Guardian allowed bullshit published. Combination cultural overdrinking, drug epidemic HIV. 4000 IU upper limit suggested National Instiutes surprising. Coming back campus whether back June, around people spread even constant testing bubble. idea get numbers there's honestly use taking someone like you, ok me. ‚úåÔ∏è  beginning, old obese quarantined, rest population could get back work. response epidemic, day one, whatever takes protect Boomers matter much screws Millennials Millennials actually went along it! interstate commerce clause. There‚Äôs really big mental flaw America write anything legally challenging impossible yet constantly try change reinterpret law fit personal opinions.

Like, Florida ASKING people come interstate travel REQUESTING airlines cancel interstate flights DOESNT violate ICC all. nothing so-called-lockdown ever request. Yeah, freedom infect community?   That's ridiculous. There's central leadership actual plan here. even think people freaking people wearing masks protests face coverings banned large part world could use facial recognition technology protests horrible plan force us wear masks now. figured make 14 10

We figure make go 14 10.

It 10 along.

We guessed 14 conservatism, we're lowing 10 due significantly data now.

Nothing virus changed one bit though. still transmissible infectous ever was. Yeah screw faculty staff! restaurants supposed survive? one replied this? I'm sure I'm missing something. Nevertheless...

The 19 ""Covid-19‚Äù identifies year virus first made appearance. virus began China 2019. number never change. Go where? Everything shut. Everything. Los Angeles ghost town. Pandemic over? really Coronavirus news? elderly quarantine then? may last year, may interested going (mom) again.



There safe places go night, area. even much day. two cemeteries town used tweakers/homeless cut across get areas faster drugs etc. pretty bad town, unfortunately.



Thank suggestion though! seen social economic upheaval World War Z? bit troll U.K. sub. I‚Äôm warning you. Students aren‚Äôt stupid. know leaders, including college administrators, failed us every level. 

lmao?

""They're dumb irresponsible, adults fault!""

Such stereotypical reddit post. Edit add something atheism something donating Bernie really max out. Good catch Yeah curious know . thought companies offering now. Literally one know goes office anymore even thinking Gross. ultra-orthodox didnt wait rosh hashanah, held bunch religious gatherings beforehand. they're real problem virus israel r/therealjoke   30 years left gents RIP tried herd immunity refusing insurance coverage? difference According Smoothvibe, even mild infections possibly cause lung heart damage. that‚Äôs case you‚Äôll need vaccinate elderly high risk groups.  mernepe allows control indefinitely. Otherwise would mean give point. no. 4 month ago Ian‚Äôs told 2 day lockdown would get everything control. would happen went out? 121 6,700,000 cases. OP simply sharing article found, get knickers bunch. strain have? 

The strain coronavirus first emerged China since mutated least five additional strains, one become prevalent strain around world. Since cases reinfection, seems thing might like flu antibodies one strain might protect another. Yikes. might point throwing fucking elbow jaw stupid fuck wants approach try stop shopping. Sweet dreams...

At least he's getting HARD shove glass door gets face homicidal stupidity. helpful information, listed here, R-value (avg # people infected person infects) WHERES BASELINE??

I read single comment mentioning lack clarity definition ‚ÄúCovid-19 needs be‚Äù. Without baseline metric supposed measure know approaching surpassed intended goal? article highly subjective due lack numerical data agreed upon baseline work towards.

CNN must consider public gullible. Probably increased testing. beginning meet specific criteria even get tested all, even generally pretty bad hospital. days they're picking lot mild asymptomatic cases. think numbers Spring waaay low, whereas probably closer somewhat accurate.

This think need stop publicizing case numbers all, many variables testing capacity, testing criteria, testing recommendations ever accurate reflection true number current infections. need focusing hospitalizations deaths. long stay low numbers cause concern far I'm concerned. Better yet, cheap ass parents kids candy next day. know, like grown-ups do. dont think currently infected. believe he‚Äôs talking last 6 months 1/3 population Canada. amount cases. Ai Okay viral infections don‚Äôt directly infect heart, SARS2 does. ~~For good confectionery industry?~~

To continue support industry deep roots slavery? hope true, can't find candidates one ready November (maybe I'm wrong said somewhere). think highly unlikely candidates turn ""good"", fact telling candidates ready November would indicate one two options:

1. really sure ""good"". would imply lying cannot guarantee vaccine ready November.

2. candidate know ""good"" (i.e., experiments certain vaccine finished almost finished proven effective safe) want say candidate ""the winner"" avoid hurting companies.

I hope second option correct one still like kind statement. would like know candidate expected ready November why.  Shit kills Covid vial necessarily effective body, may even harm us.

Bleech would probably kill covid test tube, put body unless name Donald Trump,who apparantly immune it. Good! Dutch government recently changed quarantaine 14 10 days this. young, much shit africa kills you, obese need food sedentary lifestyles that. Plenty vitamin intense sun. less time inside many areas. 

it's kinda sad basically continent shit much, awkward side effect making covid relatively minor concern. like suddenly swarms angry bees around, barely notice hiding fighting packs wild dogs century. welcome cite primary literature think supports you.

I understand limitations method, it‚Äôs damned sight better pulling numbers ass like want do.

You don‚Äôt know talking about.

I‚Äôm literally published microbiologist.

That doesn‚Äôt make expert, mean read understand many papers.

Anyway. welcome provide evidence keep empty assertions.

Y‚Äôall really creationists.

Smh Kastrup tests still free.

What changed anybody could walk get test appointment.

This result everybody used place get test, plane travellers used less (longer lines). 

The test station like parking lot outside airport.

So changed show plane ticket get tested, order reserve travellers.

IDK make airlines pay - zero money moment lol. Can't pluck hair bald man, saying goes. 5,000 redditor sounds right then. Ugh even allowed open fucking windows all. That's great numbers true, FL, instance, never ending BS. whole point ""positivity rate"" see testing adequate, compare areas, etc, can't numbers issued state, ""positivity rate""

1) include positives people live here, official residents (quite including migrants, snowbirds, students, NBA, others)

2) include huge numbers tests taken state deemed lab longer accept results (includes largest lab)

3) include mass quantities tests largest hospital system deemed unreliable.

Those might seem acceptable realize count:

1) Negatives groups

2) Positives counted, tests effectively calling positives negative way ""positivity rate calculated.

3) 1st time positives counted, tests are, someone tests positive every day 100 days (there number groups testing daily), even 100% positive tests every time yield's official positivity rate 1%.

The list shenanigans goes on, get idea. back dating deaths sitting deaths months independently ""verified"" actually worse makes numbers past 6 weeks completely unreliable.

For months, shut testing centers citing hurricanes never came, etc 1/4 previous testing levels, even though new positives clearly 3/4 match, used constantly claim dropping ""positivity rate""

It seem finally dripping bit, though pain tell requires recalculating numbers properly generally yields figure least 3x state claims.

All able compare rate states lying citizens ordering school districts share infection data. live place that's happening, consider lucky, rest us, assuming positivity rate actually going anything straight forward.

Hopefully true.  think connection fires... Honestly, number nordic countries low right (even bit increases) unless starts go really bad, say peak maybe two weeks (or rather two weeks infections hospitalizations peak). way worried Spain France countries hit hard spring seems large surge infections hospitalizations :( Definitely could be. would worried someone sneezing bowl house becoming spreader. community hosting massive meet greet complete food trucks, bouncy houses more. 

It outdoors, can‚Äôt believe hosting now. Worst part one best friends came idea got gears rolling.. would bet anything Americans less social distancing 2 months ago. schools open. clothesline? amazing idea. birds carry seasonal flu much care international border closures. Prob taking australia / nz etc Fascists coming woodwork...

Know years 4th Riech. look governmental Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports, covert fascism becomes blatantly apparent; centralized autocratic government paying lip service overthrown constitution, people enslaved paper national plantation. Thanks England even (grin)...  sets terrible precedent. mean, still fall winter get form business closures undoubtedly necessary. Like neighbours, testing got increased yielded approximately positivity rate week before: 
142k tests last week around 1 % positivity. 
That increase 16k, 126k tested similar positivity rate. [All hard facts statistics it‚Äôs totally safe open New York. climate Europe-like death tolls steadily declining since Europe started opening up. Don‚Äôt confuse ‚Äúcasedemic‚Äù see perform PCRs en masse, positive results correlated hospitalization. video also shows lockdowns totally useless, wearing masks won‚Äôt add extra protection society likely won‚Äôt need mass vaccination... completely agree, entire point shouldn‚Äôt speaking absolutes like original comment‚Äù

‚ÄúImmunity short lived‚Äù dangerous precedent set keep talking like that. That‚Äôs people still think ibuprofen aggravates COVID, non-N95 masks useless.

ËçâÔºàÔºâ get 20 pills ibuprofen $1 India. Wtf say anti-inflammatory meds made illness worse first ?... Comparing total cases July April, mention oof positivity rate. mention false positives.  Wait Thanksgiving rolls around. there's Christmas New Years. INDOOR celebrations, Yes, careful sentiments comes datasets. starters, 44 111 study counting admitted unrelated issues - asymptomatic cases. Secondly, study looked subset cases Canada. Thirdly, know many cases listed unrelated issues study actually included official data.

Also, cases official data ages. [My count 20 ranges 4-6 Canada official data shows 1 range.

At beginning COVID, understand obscuring details patient privacy hundred cases would possible provide details public without compromising privacy. ALLOWED LEAVE ANYMORE. wonder Ohio hard time filling health director job. silly, wake there's petition shoes oppressive BS gone long! study that's cited shows 100% specificity. assume article notes 98-99 caveat low n cautious. read layman? Sure. tells us one knows anything sure now. So, listen scientists say stuff depend live things help live too. Cheers.    deaths normal month. Peak 10-14 days so.

This assumption beat CPH outbreak like √Örhus Odense.  Vitamin deficiency actually worse Africa think B makes sense. took while, finally convinced family go roast beef. get turkey traditional, everyone literally likes beef turkey, wasting time damn turkey?? idea. I've using N95 got doctor since April. also probably infect life human, cat - dog, perhaps variety others too. Therefore probably unknown place honestly, spread via way. think intelligence much problem lack empathy is. dumb hell, care people going take precautions regardless.  Fuck automod bot

There's easy explanation that. Early pandemic, (cities/states align them, i.e. New York) getting hit. documented (the leader country's son) forming task force disbanding found might work favor. swept (areas support them, i.e. Texas) start take seriously. Emerged =/= Originated. evil. never 100% infection rate.

50-60% realistic maximum, possibly even lower due individual precautions. 100% Us media really cover much terms international news begin with... Call dentist office. mine answer questions phone good go, PPE everything NIH intramural clinical director Nath say AstraZeneca's vaccine trial (emphasis mine). AstraZeneca ‚Äúneed[s] **more forthcoming** potential complication vaccine eventually given millions people,‚Äù said Nath. ‚ÄúWe would like see help, **lack information** makes difficult so.‚Äù

So safe Oxford vaccine anyway? pharmaceutical company running trial sharing information government regulators? hiding? 

A covid vaccine potentially injected billions people. people demand transparency risks? also think, tested people border, you's fewer people test inside country, get capacity it.

My girlfriend yoga teacher yoga place last week took test aurport positive.

So test, stayed home ends her. take test, would sure infect everybody yoga place, people hang would infect people on.

Just one test prevented happening. like easier put forest fire first tree instead 20 trees burning.

It's voluntary get tested airport, sure lot people bother. heard someone ""because 10 people line."" Fuck noise. want grubby kids banging door hours end bowl empty asshole teenager took candy. BOT! Yes, agreement. Insane overreaction using lockdown. Like treating headache hammer. Lol could account people, fatality rate would even lower. method allows meaningful comparison deadliness COVID-19 countries case fatality rates, mean nothing different testing strategies. Yeah know study it‚Äôs surprising see place really get hit twice entire pandemic *no clue* many kids actually get severe reactions. meant continue shutting things based one-off anecdotes? guess didn‚Äôt realize ever left list. opposed sovereignty? Switzerland, Holy See, Crown...I sure more, scope limited.. 

And point trying get ? wall maintains social distance. ""CNN""

Yea, ok. I'll start: Finland According thr Bible God mercy heretics. Wow, that's first me! another weird story this, though. nana's brother shingles, supposedly happens chicken pox. insisted (and everyone gets it?) chicken pox. remember 10 years old reading study shingles see could part it, required chicken pox... like dumbfounded?

Oh sister supposedly died diphtheria vaccine supported grandson's wife vaccinating first great-grandson autism. wonder situation would changed mind. Sleep schedules delicate thing. 4th July let Scarlett stay fireworks, loved, put going bed 11pm. didn‚Äôt think big deal went straight sleep after.. WRONG. two weeks earliest went sleep 2am, days wouldn‚Äôt sleep 4 5 am. Worst 2 weeks ever lol Honestly even country competent leadership, karens would still huge issue. people reason like blame entirely president alone. lot people around country positions power making worse. Maybe. patient gets sick nursing home, generally they'll go hospital. Like think nursing home *wouldn't* send someone heart attack actual hospital???

So points mutually exclusive. sick patietns went nursing homes led sick patients led people needing go hospital. clear....I meant doesn‚Äôt magically appear thin air. deaths hospitalizations less half July, wish headline included info fair ER Hospital, can't big jar ibuprofen, individual doses, hare handled number times high cost individuals, legitimately going background increase individual cost drug. Saying that, $90 discount $30 still likely highway robbery, real extra cost per pill might $15 something (I idea really is, possible $30 real), compared counter price still high. trust CDC FDA this. take vaccine put administration I'm way anti-vaxxer. Flu season coming. say wrong. adding additional info know what‚Äôs funny, even vaccine made, anti-vaxxers would probably still refuse get Bro less 10000 died DIRECTLY. Something tells pretty control. Maybr dont gather together woodstock celebrations people think entitled to. Cdc count 10000 covid deaths rest underlying conditions.

Facts shunned hurt feelings! 

Wheres yellow hazardous waste bins correct disposal contaminated masks gloves? 

Also theyve said masks wont help smoke california, smoke particles 0.75 microns boogeyman virus 0.12 micron, mask/muzzle isnt going protect you.

Also numbers still high tb death rate.... heard Easter, heard *Second* Easter? ‚ÄúBy fall‚Äù

Is mid-September fall? Fall here. COVID clearly going anywhere. Saying ‚Äúby fall‚Äù makes sound like we‚Äôve got months fall comes. 

Nope. Schools back session. Halloween decorations sold stores. Leaves changing colors many places. We‚Äôve missed ‚Äúby fall‚Äù boat. Next best hope ‚Äúby Christmas‚Äù rate I‚Äôm holding breath that. start border control border Sweden 2015

Where say happened 2015? hard read Malm√∂ region far higher numbers people hospitalised ICU

no. Sk√•ne (the whole region) zero ICU patients right now. positivity rate 14 per 100.000. region ""Hovedstaden"" Copenhagen 1 patient ICU bed 87 positive per 100.000.

So yea stop lying Or, maybe, careen virus season disease anywhere near control, people without Halloween year make political stand. proactively POTUS. assuming recovered people always develop antibodies true. exciting hear last time ever! like incorporating kind social distancing-compliant candy collection device costume--great idea! IMO Halloween probably holiday fall/winter we'll able easily make Coronoavirus-compliant, little things like make possible. you‚Äôre okay Russia‚Äôs vaccine? invent it.

Why would think said implied did?

You're discussing exists, reason.

I'm discussing whether useful comparing countries. isn't. could tell true? Also probability said person getting tested times he/she's infected, virus sequenced genetically times prove reinfection.   Sadly condescending, Im American. You‚Äôll always negative 48 hours, ideally need wait least 3 days, 5 optimal. Seems like pretty legitimate concern. try find saw data showed patients &lt; 30 cycle positives 30 cycle positives. went show likelihood hospitalization death. seems obvious clinical difference low threshold high threshold positives many patients. 

None *necessarily* argues lower threshold imply positives equal may worth considering make policies, treat patients, etc. wear N95 twice week - throw maybe month.

When use, baked sun dashboard. 

I figure sunlight, heat, time, getting mostly disinfected uses. 

There's obviously studies prove/disprove strategy, *feel* like better using new surgical mask time. Places hit hard early lagging places were. one it? Source? Remember get flu shot! Kastrup tests still free.

Thanks clarification, know changed valid ticket/travel also believed free. passengers danes? Florida, apparently. know someone ICU right now. month old

My daughter shy 9 months old come Halloween Day. ago bought really cute costume thrift shop: red hooded sweatshirt decorated multi-colored cotton balls outside hood gray swatch fabric chest ""25 cents"" written sharpie. would gumball machine! love idea walking around stroller Halloween certainly realize heck going on. may still we'll outside, that's big factor reducing risk spread. actually probably stop us bedtime: goes sleep 6:30 7 every evening working really well keep sleeping night. risk messing 7 likely stop us Halloween year. everyone porch porch light. trick treat years spent apartment building. parents taught avoid annoying people want participate.

Also, didn‚Äôt great athletic stamina weeks following Covid recovered 100% soon after. I‚Äôve noticed skeptics hoaxers question style misinfo thinking they‚Äôre sneaky.

Bill Gates knocked FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn shift plasma treatment expressed confidence drug companies behind vaccine.

Also: ‚ÄúGates said expects safe vaccine come development effort.‚Äù Nooo, Dihydrogen monoxide, stuff dangerous!

Did know everyone ever drowned killed Dihydrogen monoxide? conclusive numbers. limited experience however insurance based health care resistant follow post infection.

Im sure people think trick treating involves walking around outsie. that.  Here's latest case/death charts California, running 7-day deaths seem trending downward.  overall California badly. They're 36.46 deaths per 100k, well US per capita average 58.4. That‚Äôs pretty cool though.

I would feel different rapid testing available everyone freely. recently interesting article think Atlantic wealthy folks throwing parties test people door, results 15 minutes.

Imagine available everyone sit table movie theater... unfortunately cost prohibitive.

Why New York state hides numbers LTC residents died outside LTC facility? OP's point: else think keep getting million cases deaths hospitalizations keep dropping week week?

He's literally arguing there's reason worry cases actually lead deaths anymore. crackpot stuff. U.S. went surge highly sensitive PCR testing widely used. spike cases still eventually led deaths.  garbage allowed spread sub. encourages people put others risk.  Reinfection 100% thing point. They've done genetic typing disease confirmed happen. frequency severity reinfection unknown right seems probably think (because everyone's infection gets DNA typed first time around) still pretty rare. far cases confirmed reinfection fairly small number severe initial infection. researchers report today (September 14, 2020) journal Cell Ab8 highly effective preventing treating SARS-CoV-2 infection **mice hamsters**.

Valentines Day Friday. Fourth July Saturday. Christmas Friday. birthday Friday... set well. Thank you! two mutually exclusive. Chinese companies malicious poor quality control. smart company outsourced China hire someone trust live China review QC continuously. talking covid expectations, nothing else MLM people going die zero cases?

Not worth response.

That's enough ignorant trolling. actual data vaccine articles claiming China may something November ill believe goes country well. speculation hearsay. Many people refuse acknowledge this, whether masks.

Nice see intelligent people once. Yes people sensible enough know trick treating look different year, meet friends outside, go home right hang outside weather permitting. focusing attention/worry idiots going throw ragers (superspreaders) Halloween weekend. PUT MONEY BAG, HURRY! I'M PLAYING MAHJONG GUYS HOUR US, motor vehicle accidents would rank 13th among causes death, they're #1 ages 1-44 years.  Remember months ago people said thing spike cases south? deaths inevitably shot later guys disappeared while?

Um, no? Cases never spiked within timeframe doomers claimed would. Georgia declared ""ritual human sacrifice"" declining death statistics weeks. Texas Florida declined death totals 8 weeks straight, long people said apocalypse 

Again, left changed narrative toward focusing ""cases"" vs ""deaths"", actually matter. gas lighting highest order. ""Flatten curve"" changed ""Lower curve"" somewhere along way, possible. 

Here's FACTS

If counted regular flu season deaths like count Covid-

In US classifying anyone died Covid Covid death. years ago CDC tells us 45,000,000 Americans infected flu. That's 13.7% population. given year US see 3m deaths. roughly 400,000 attributable deaths.

But gets worse. allowing doctors classify Covid based symptoms. issues 3rd leading cause death US, 400,000 would go dramatically criteria.



So use fake numbers make argument, I'm going take argument seriously. hate break you, real life, sometimes bad things happen. sometime bad things kill lot people there's whole hell lot anyone it. Covid one thigns. Every kid going either doctor ninja year. Please send money I‚Äôm willing give sympathy simply really early on. got hit hard fast, first deaths. feel much less sympathy rest country ample warning saw tri-state area lock properly. Like first big spike, should‚Äôve woken up. might interested [that since seem [one drawn for.

South Korea pop: 50 millions. USA pop: 328 millions. Factor: x6.5.

South Korea Deaths: 324. USA Deaths: 200'000. Factor: x617.

Note *if South Korea populated China*, would 324 deaths * 1'400 millions / 50 millions = ~9000 deaths. China half number, much harsher measures.

*Edit: removed reference wrong movie.* can't say get $30 exactly, pill costs hospital much less, probably even less would pay counter. cost overhead handling. cost paying people work hospital handle pill. cumulative costs things like Receive package pills, put pills storage, take pills storage, deliver nurses administer them, plus cost various bosses, administrators, etc... Yes, are. much ""nothing done"" die faster? Thank you! Chilling read. Maybe falling smear campaign. That‚Äôs one reason, dominant one, would think. 

The main reason higher hospitalisation rate caught perhaps 10% actual cases April-May, whilst catch perhaps 50% today. 

Point being: blind before. Less half capacity massive *outdoor* stadium *masks required*?

BC, one actually wants solve shit first.  4000 generally accepted safe daily upper limit. Talk doctor folks. realize it, don‚Äôt care. Don‚Äôt worry certain someone pressure FDA approving Nov 2-3. Tencent also 20% share reddit... know that's phrase people say, odds get it. haven‚Äôt knowingly exposed anyone contracted virus. don‚Äôt shithole country strong contact tracing programs test people (who ‚Äúfeel
fine‚Äù) anywhere near anyone contracted virus. need critical thinking here. really difficult problem solve. minority perfectly capable quarantining several months herd immunity established low risk portion population. that's Halloween spirit! I'm gonna put individual candy bags little table hands sanitizer. think would ok scrap it? Honest question. Safety top priority bet people wanted go safe alternative people still think fake? herd immunity I'm reading first link see nothing sore throat present 50% cases... Wait life expectancy low? That's strange. way generally death certificates US would immediate cause, contributing factors. COVID-19 death certificate may read acute respiratory distress syndrome immediate cause, pneumonia COVID-19 infection contributing factors. caused lot confusion weeks ago CDC said 6% deaths COVID-19 written certificate. actuality, death certificate COVID written down. username, actually UK Government? Friends finished quarantine return China. Family quarantines together one hotel room. split up. true business death miss ""other guy"" threat America instead person slightly different beliefs best address problems we're facing. scares much long term effects survive. value mobility exercise much quality life would suffer immensely lose them. Trump's Federal Judges overturning masking orders. yeah, loooonnng time Even vaccine? Never stepping foot restaurant? don‚Äôt sound hyperbolic all. went gym today first time since March. completely alone work-out, light routine exercises start all.

I wearing P99 mask through-out (3M 9332+ Aura), faced problems breathing exercises. wanted drink water refrained taking mask moved along.

I still feel confident comfortable work-out residual viral particles air left behind apparently linger air hours. I'm probably going put shit hold resume running outside. Gosh, who'd thought testing would required?

Oh yeah, government. many COVID-19 deaths Denmark?

And Sweden? Sadly, going happen lot population takes seriously. See Thumbnail visual answer. Thanks. Sounds like people know tbh, addition glove wearing.  

What's complicated implication someone cannot manage risk choose, larger effect community. 

Say. I'm sick, neither 10 closest friends. get together play video games well ventilated garage. Everyone young healthy, least presumed so. one gets sick afterwards.  

Now. wrong? increased risk, consequences realized. Hard convince people risk.

After successful gathering follow. least pattern I've seen among people know since June. 

There hard lines cross, know group traveling state bachelorette party. Travel one thing necessary, sharing house (and air) group like high high high risk exposure. Obviously bad. say, one group gets sick. Again, hard turn nose tell morally wrong/what risk was. People thrive doom gloom. insane. Cases dropping almost everywhere, mortality down, things looking up. percent said, contributed death 190,000 Americans six months. minority population deserve protective actions majority health crisis affects vulnerable? responsibility decent honorable society year 2020? much worse Seattle. guys collect smoke neighboring fires? Pretty sure bad viral infection cause myriad long lasting issues. I've sick couple times last 10 years ""normal"" one. First time developed neurological issues. second time developed GIRD issues. downplaying severity covid, want get it. People making seem like post infection issues exclusive SAR-Cov-2. Well trick unfortunately may family individual states give Amazon hundreds millions tax breaks decades build distribution centers, afford give schools tax break semester. Yeah, saying right COVID America over. We've internalized school shootings, death medical debt, climate change thousand awful things ""just stuff happens sometimes."" think we'll different ignores track record. Well, shit. doesn‚Äôt take expert see that. long people parties weddings bullshit, COVID-19 isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Right... season go away.... believe going round 2 4 seasons. side effects all. feel like it‚Äôs got safer getting COVID right? kids (who 20 22 years old) sister Moderna trial. kids got first shot last night one said arm hurt bit it. Moderna mRNA vaccine too. high risk quarantine wish. reality covid remote risk death majority population. Pretty sure you‚Äôre right, believe right summer came around concluded pools safe, **provided social distancing pool**. 

Of course, chances least people properly social distancing. Woah! find Alex Jones' Infowars store? Ask she'd enjoy it. know love good scavenger hunt. could put little gifts well favorite treats. could new tradition! Ok, measures unconstitutional, epidemic data justify measures. ruling say Governor respond data, says Governor can't circumstances did.


So guess question is: authority put restrictions place constitution?


If answer, push governors?


If one authority, perhaps rethink situation make changes.


We could find situation point facing something far worse COVID-19. want debating change constitution middle massive pandemic. Labs across world ""gain function"" testing many years. 

There might markers circumstances wanted hide it, would possible. 

Not mention, political climate even allow accusation (if valued career). 

Not saying happened, would never know. ever found out, would investigations would expose science unfortunately. damn that's shit lol... we're already doing

Squinty face LMAO give covid allow people go facilities No.

I'm not.

Of course, little difficult sift Covid messaging Trumps says one thing privately, opposite public point man messaging HHS uses position bury change reports tell followers go buy ammo late shooting starts election night.

Some gaslit zombie tell I'm making too. least vaccine come relatively soon.  (Kaiser Health News) Food Drug Administration weighing whether follow British regulators resuming coronavirus vaccine trial halted participant suffered spinal cord damage, even National Institutes Health launched investigation ""The highest levels NIH concerned,"" said Dr. Avindra Nath, intramural clinical director leader viral research National Institute Neurological Disorders Stroke, NIH division. ""Everyone's hopes vaccine, major complication whole thing could get derailed."" russian one already? Check sample size totally-legit ‚Äútwice likely dined restaurant‚Äù

While you‚Äôre it, check see differentiated indoor outdoor dining asking. they? public need vaccine life gets back normal? vaccinate say oldest, vulnerable 20% could prevent like 80% deaths. That's smells like someone owes money die collect payment estate, im collecting money children estate yet. arent entitled inheritance parents told youd one. clearly deadlier end winter spring/summer. 

It‚Äôs enter first fall/full winter websites list number people still getting COVID. [Here's there's lots them. 

There two states less 200 cases last seven days (Vermont Maine), - everywhere still getting COVID. far education system taught divide polynomials forgot completely within 3 days moved onto next lesson.

heh...

I often neglect i'm going adult soon. Username checks course safe. right away least. Look happened first round polio vaccine 1955. 20,000 children ended contracting polio vaccine, 200 left kind paralysis 10 died. 

[The Cutter Incident thrown money problem mean accomplished fighting diseases. Maybe get home protect sense. know people really trust FDA, they're working expect investigating allowing trial unpause US. interesting how, whenever look leadership change course automatically assume conspiracy. Usually related power and/or money. Rather than, oh, wrong -- we've got new information we've reevaluated original viewpoint. answer many children many observed answered studies. err side caution write comments MIS-C common thing know rare serious complication. lost 4 years ago. highly stratified age, surveys showing roughly 0.01% 0.05% 50 crowd 5% 65 plus Amazing medical experts keep repeating indoor rallies, excuses justifications NV unbelievable. Even tests ""too sensitive"" issue see takes longer downward trends apparent, assuming virus actually declining population. areas seem taking account case rate setting policy, maybe big deal.

A separate issue insufficient resources high CT testing, leading delays unnecessary expense. Well, China one party state, Xi re-election reasons too? fail understand new wave progressive anti-vaxxers. I'm almost certain drug helpful, since imagine significant population vaccinate. think. wish socio path would this. Waves infection expected. rise fall, big problem comes next peak hits. goal get number infections low possible next peak needs make ground. We‚Äôre entering cold/flu season schools opening, hopefully see reduction flu cases, still compound. since still pretty high infection rate ~35, 000 per day, next peak likely pretty bad.  
We flattened curve skin teeth som places, didn‚Äôt put work actually reduce caseload lot. anything it‚Äôs gone up. look daily cases since started, last Valley 20,000 cases day. we‚Äôre valley expect coming month two show steep increase.  
Lastly it‚Äôs important view long term Covid infections trend lines. trend still increasing, despite us currently ‚Äúlull.‚Äù go college tell literally one gives shit. Bars packed, big indoor house parties people crammed together. one wears mask social distancing running joke. flu seasons a-coming. Eh, maybe. Seems like pointing pretty glaring issue currently consider ""case"". Viewing binary probably correct approach. NYT article issue highlighted lab NE 90% tests greater 30 (or 35?) cycles. caseload would much different situation reversed. Epidemiologists focused almost entirely minimizing COVID. considerations cost measures. know least 3 people covid19 fuck takeout risky? It‚Äôs April anymore, dude üòÇ years socio,educational income inequality perfect match disease.  Add bunch freedumbers argue it‚Äôs lazy people poor diets voila....the US fucked. no, read article. announce $5 billion bucks SuperPac task electing democrats everywhere, would say great. Wow, didn‚Äôt even notice that, thanks! Absolutely. Gotta dummy things down, people. Unfortunately. ""This drug"" postexposure prophylactic. Im referring article.

Using types drugs early symptoms arise successful vaccine likely required 3 times year... amd produced meaningfulvolume quitea years come. (Not even considering anti-vaxers) also good point. understand saying, possibly help sicker people survive whereas would died, possible survival also entail significant effects typically seen before. Increasing case numbers solely indicative increased testing. baseless metric.

Are global deaths increasing decreasing? same, slightly decreasing. ^ message brought Postmates I'm calling now: people concerned ""killing"" grandmas point visit even vaccine available truly regret choice line grandma dies anyways non-COVID related causes.

Wear mask continue living life TODAY. Get vaccine available continue living life. let panic make regret life choices. think fair describe Americans like this, probably 50% them. I'm mobile, see fine. Ive following everything since March. still holding pat even though tiring. However, wife really getting fringes. know christmas going help. words: terrorist hates america? think virus, whole, starting fizzle out. nature correcting itself. virus keeps trying mutate strains, nature RIGHT heels, cleaning mess virus. that's life works. amazing see. virus keeps trying spread infect live...but nature takes hold keeps virus bay virus keep mutating fully die. comes nature again.

I say time lift measures slowly coming sooner think. numbers deaths remaining low flatlined, huge increases testing good sign! thing fizzling out. say that. one seems read article included. article like many said due young population like one mentioned parasites continents have. Fighting Covid like zipper merging, works everyone plays along. mean time average length time takes symptoms. guarantee symptoms day. incubation period 14 days symptoms (if do) within 14 days exposure. you, I'd take vitamin call doctor available help line get advice. true France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, UK, Sweden? ask much plan covers full deductible? Mine 100% deductible paid $0 since deductibles waived I'm curious plan covers 90% cost hit max pocket that's paid $30? We've (apparently) decided deaths acceptable. China Russia love bickering gets whats left. choices? Assuming immunity real thing. Poeple virus early year show sign antibodies. Also, people get infected lower number virus particles due mainly outside wearing masks, cases less severe. sure talking US world wide. US 6 million cases. worldwide 30 million.  unique opinion. Wearing mask mouth prevents spread virus person others, wearing mask nose protects wearer. So, concerned someone wearing mask nose, probably hurting you.

I basing data saw nose lot (like 400 times more) ACE2 receptors mouth, receptors virus enters body. Batch testing / pool testing works really well positive rate low. China using method since May, 5th city city-wide testing (Wuhan, Xinjiang, Beijing Dalian), entire teams devoted fly in, cost reportedly $5-$10 per person tested. Yeah we're giving treats directly two sets neighborhood kids happen know well, we're tying caution tape shrubs either side path house. Sorry, no, coming door. someone calculate excess deaths whole world far? Maybe missing lot people IFR calculation. Also, many asymptomatic cases. someone know estimate includes two?   it!! Good luck!! world US would actually resources willingness take task, I‚Äôd say parent gets behind lawsuit notified child protective services. They‚Äôre either mentally unfit parents believe wackjob conspiracy theory, they‚Äôre unfit use children political props regard potential outcome death.  likely happen. would cut Sweden rest Europe. Finally took bait.

Thanks. Great, last year HS fucked college years too... :(

If ever get hands Xi beat hard spit intestines...

I can't bear world anymore, want 90s back... born early 2000s considering present (and future) world sucks I'd rather old way. remember saying bad China containing virus. Oh man, days believed American ingenuity blissful time. You‚Äôre worst. could also wear mask use social distance precautions, people shit either. Im surprised. emergency room Florida charged insurance like $30 one pill ibuprofen, smh doubt anything like researched tested time useful Covid-19.

There large populations that, whatever reason, can't vaccinated. refuse vaccine, immunocompromised, simply low priority/live poor country first wave infections, early effective treatments crucial, even vaccine exists.

Herd immunity vaccination caps R number 1. means that, take distancing, stuck nearly number cases R number drops meaningfully 1.

There's guarantee herd immunity reached - vaccine effectiveness take-up could low, sterilizing immunity may last. case, vaccines still huge role depressing transmission, end pandemic outright.

Regardless, goal elimination, neutralization cases occur essential prevent spread vulnerable populations, perhaps forever, certainly next years rapid response. first thought guy pic wearing shark costume...made day little brighter. exactly still? Lots people talking hard working rona, many specifics.

Mask wearing? hangouts? there, really? Spoken someone Florida opened bars, forcing schools stay quiet school outbreaks, shut 3 5 testing sites town last week, we're one hell ride come winter. lot times workers I'm at. multiple outbreaks 1/2 hour away. workers dont wear masks, customers wont. I've quit going businesses like people make statements like ""Life return normal"" ridicule effort make normal &amp; staying fuck inside calling introvert comment. making dumb ""Covid stay"" statement. contradict hard 1 comment?

I'd rather introvert selfish shit minded extrovert  one stunned. 5000 ui? tablets 1000... says 1 day. saying take 5 people really shouldn‚Äôt answer doors then....not dick mean ain‚Äôt answering door even I‚Äôm expecting someone. put decorations weekend remove days trick treating. city made announcement day yet year.  isn‚Äôt good reason think that.

And puzzled suggest good reason assume 2021 going mess?

What positives clinging makes bet 2021 following clear(or least rest us) patterns ? Please, point signs worlds politicians changing ways, planet magically starting stop melting? Tell us countries like Russia China going stop playing games world stage, pushing luck? Tell us suddenly Brexit going leave everyone smiles faces (apart big told smile UK) looking like big mess awaits that? going magically go away 3 months? 

You tell us signs seeing us doomers lead think going get better, could pick up. anyone know use meningitis vaccine placebo instead saline injection? it‚Äôs Europe ? lot less 2% asked them? grandparents 80s STRONGLY disagree this. days go second ""lockdown"" Kids eating candy night! They'll touching mouths distributing virus. everyone going happy Grandpa dies two weeks later? Yeah get people saying leave bowl out. fuck 'everybody' need come away overindulged jackasses happy?   tried long shutdown, backfired situations like flocks migrant workers returning home infecting new areas. Really sad, hopefully vaccine available sooner rather later. leave bowl, encourage madness

Also young people still get infected pass around. Oh good bowl full viruses! 

Then treasured memories grandma dying! tagged Europe!  countries say they‚Äôve gone x number days without cases mean local cases. They‚Äôre still getting imported cases cases they‚Äôre quarantined arrival there‚Äôs risk community. Eastern European countries lower death numbers. Genes vaccines, knows. Gotta switch hands Well shit, bunch idiots lol US regulators. vaccine track US approval late October Pfizer, maybe Oxford/AZ one seems less likely now. issue is, Australia, Victoria outlier. they're going pretty hard get numbers match rest country.

We 8 states/territories, 5 0 cases community transmission (and while, WA gone 150+ days)

2 minor amounts (5 less day) operating pretty normally (Restrictions clubs dancing, gathering sizes, even mandatory masks). Vic trying get to.

And lastly there's Victoria. 800 cases day gone pretty intense lockdown join rest country.

Once they're back sub 5 cases day. Australia (mostly) open back hopefully stay way. fun too, see lol Hopefully much. point everyone supposed work together since we're fighting common enemy. Although make harder. course meant help Germans. similar C day. one asked time. Poor Germans. I‚Äôm really interested see masking influenza numbers. suddenly see serious drop flu deaths? Amen!

Came say this.

I'm buying little gifts neighbor kids. That's it. Full stop. vectors house! work along friends, insufferable fool one working office. please change job get something decent.  called sane fine pretty much point I've reached well. sad, eye-opening. dont young kids, 1/2 hour away 13 year old went camp sick covid. Wasnt hospitalized, sick many days. company forcing work office.

oh innocent oblivious. data prove that? far know, used contact tracing quarantine early contain outbreaks there. federal mandate would nice, doubt Trump ever go direction. frustrating thing place quarantine rules, still anti-mask idiots like ""see, bad""

Like fucking shit, everyone else part you. thats wondering

Since much said Vitamin working here-

Why dont doctors prescribe covid patients? sister-in-law decided go wedding last weekend Brown County (WI). ceremony 100% mask compliance walked reception 120+ people mask INDOORS. left immediately even another wedding venue happening. Completely baffled - it‚Äôs like decided fun virus can‚Äôt touch you. sad. total guesswork hypothesis based reading news last 6 months: Better vitamin levels many Africans get longer duration direct sunlight part day day lives.

My Hypothesis B - exposure various viruses African cultures developed immune system handle new virus better.  Child here, fuck shit, I‚Äôm risking life get candy get sale next day many covid cases China? Anyone know? Better late never? conclusively shown yet, studies researching currently looks promising, yes. America got bored. referring gyms police city employees. outrage. Saved click.  happens people keep sayings big deal people recover thinking long term damage anyone else. It‚Äôs really shown selfish are. unskilled. would gmp manufacturing biologic product. people work floor type processes associates degree least, probably bachelor kind science.

Third world country ‚â† country incapable development. know...speaking strip clubs Canada, multiple friends stories kicked head stripper? going strip clubs thing?ü§î cases per day peaked July 75k/day... Aspirin pills? sure. 

Cutting edge vaccines? way!!  strikingly measured tolerable approach. lot people still won‚Äôt eat inside. Wait it‚Äôs cold eat outside whiners start eating inside can‚Äôt handle eating out.  Trailer Park Boys East Coast. Plus show representative average Canadian Better remain silent thought fool speak remove doubt. Shame one complains th... oh yeah real. spread lies internet. I'm one, trust everything else read. People say ‚Äúthis harming mental health‚Äù.

What mental health people actually trying responsible feel hopeless society letting down? best 1/5 us wear them, unfortunate age well. Well, better cold flu COVID Right there‚Äôs ways it, leaving bowl prepackaged candies probably biggest risk. feel like lot people year. Side note, real all. quote Abraham Lincoln, ""You can't trust damn thing read internet."" pandemic, wore surgical mask ‚Äúflu‚Äù season - late fall early spring. people street gave strange look - like, wtf? deadly ill? didn‚Äôt care tbh health goes first. 

Now, make masks order P.m2.5 filters Puraka masks. Saves money safe. ridiculous even try talk you. believe payed write positive stuff avoid negative. someone writes real data concerns, need downvote flood ridiculous comments dilute real threat. get arround 5 bucks per comment sit States, 1 dollar outside. sound plausible, 5 star Amazon reviewer? Flu season maybe, kid daycare I'm second cold month. certainly appreciate lives stake people suffering.
Haters always find things hate China, wish China put aside, future leader hold grudges, China wants 'one up' US?, good! time act!
If countries let prejudice arrogance get way saving lives that's problem, offer help still stands regardless. 
The naysayers western media represent everyone world, innocent people suffering. save money die quickly! linger hospital months much. Well least still get thar temperature screening job Excess deaths twice reported number Mumbai. entire country.

But still lower America count excess deaths.  Well, depends job. Mine take 8 hours day, especially covid still going on. boring trapped somewhere trying look productive. I'm also original research writing articles, find distracting work space wear mask gloves. Would want busy call center home, hand? Maybe much.

There also economic benefits. could one car could work home non-covid conditions.

Edit: There's nothing wrong anyone per se. like night owls groggily pondering morning birds. hear optional part, protests necessary remain necessary given injustice country. I‚Äôm saying need evidence-based consider risk tolerance things like outdoor activities Belgium counted every death suspected covid charts. Pneumonia related deaths counted, deaths elderly homes count. done many countries makes Belgium look worse actually was. surprising.  Ya tried get tested sick back told ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre 65 dying, test you.‚Äù stage 4 cancer symptoms!! pretty stressful feeling like person boat bailing water everyone else laughs hope kill someone love go one corner expect food, looks empty then. work home, walk around house talk clients, feeding time, cat following meowing, emter living room, 100 following every move stay colorful sign hungry lol

We adopted best cat world, Madam Fru Fru aka Makule, March. made difference, made every day play fun.  Pretty much every question threads get downvoted.  yes answer.

Yes is. Experts say multitude confirmed.

You're arguing reason snitch. sucks there‚Äôs trick treating Halloween doesn‚Äôt cancelled. family going pizza party kid friendly Halloween movies, costumes, maybe scavenger hunt kids backyard. Allowed one hour exercise near home, that's it. Parks, beaches closed. Still, bad Spain Italy Latin America, agree. terrible time alive. evidence certainly suggest 20% HIT. able produce single argument rebuked either source's author overwhelmingly obvious data. Perhaps consider that's case bought into/feel need disseminate unsubstantiated speculation. bet pediatric cases actually significantly higher - often don‚Äôt symptoms aren‚Äôt tested, spreading whole time Ah, ‚Äúextra money COVID19 deaths‚Äù urban legend.

I hate Facebook much.  also says recent financial donation teams owners bank account reason doubt credibility  Mental image enhanced! Yeah, let's encourage kids go around group touching shit neighborhoods global pandemic getting worse everywhere.

This nothing Trump. US completely fucking COVID response getting worse half population basically ""got bored it"" half people never bothered care first place. must missed part emergency over. Look, know spread happens. Indoors, crowds close quarters long period time. Knowing makes sense limit capacity restaurants, churches, bars, clubs, anywhere indoors lot people congregate long time. fact, buildings already regulations capacity. fail see extension that. ""I think"" ""maybe"" we're still living state emergency? understand bit shock system, long protracted emergency. However emergency same. anyone really believe numbers US? Nothing says memorial wedding deaths destruction caused. Bruh it‚Äôs close enough november!!! [That turned hinting taking influenza seriously COVID overblown?

After bit reading personally think risk heart complications influenza alarming. health risk unnecessary cost sure, never exercise again... *happines noise* didn‚Äôt pick island move Asia amen think spring semester going look lot normal tbh state data independent federal interference thought. talking about? testing subpar. Excess death country enormous. lot death defined ‚Äúsars unknown cause‚Äù. proper KN95 effective N95. problem getting *proper* KN95 mask. quality control horrendous. ordered batch certification, tested it, far lower expected. buy one, look manufacturer demonstrates high level quality control. 

Although, problem limited Chinese suppliers, we've tested newer American supplier pass tests either. things rushed door, quality going suffer. Someone explain states like Alabama Arkansas receive funding states like California New York? Everybody chain bears responsibility - people wedding, venue, person attended sick wear mask, person attended went back work. entire problem people incredibly selfish - THEY'RE willing bear risk themselves, without thinking risk others.

For every story ""person X denied Covid died Covid"", there's web others infected probably killed decisions.

We live vacuum, live society. Except goons riding RR today near fianc√©e without masks. literally 121/200k deaths USA people ages 26 younger. fear mongering.  Hey, know worldometer thing people post subreddit dozen times every day? Yeah, lists Palestine there. They're better Israel terms per capita cases per capita deaths. I'm sure actually care, though. like analogy. admire China saving many lives rapid response COVID-19. definitely mean ""technically authoritarian government function correctly would always work better good democracy.""  gosh, found myocarditis, there's way play,' "" Daniels said general reaction. ""They're putting saying safe play. **They're reading article. they're reading it, they're putting spin it, like, 'It's actually opposite. We're saying actually found this, know path say safe go back opposed uncomfortable feeling knowing anything"" actual risk. ""Doctor, sure work?!""
""I idea!"" Don‚Äôt ridiculous, protocols place months. live university town, friends family see opposite - COVID cases counted they‚Äôve tested die COVID related pneumonia. Given many die heart complications, say deaths probably double reported. think risk infection walking outside pretty low, zero, keeping 6 feet away.

It's rude wear mask, indoor transmission that's spreading it. argument there. still success story shows turn things around even maximum failure. minutes ago  feel you. way people argue perceive bad faith. Honestly probably called smoking waking middle night feeling bold, seem reasonable kind response me. Thanks chill lol. I'm much type speak interpersonally, want be.

this reddit, supposed :) supposed bit negative one would normally - least that's perceive things :) wonder...is everyone really honest Covid going. Many parts US greatly improved...and one ever mentions even though people apocalyptic states...like Florida, Texas, AZ. really delegitimizes voice here. parts Europe like France Spain poorly hardly mentioned. Sweden flattened curve staying flat. Discuss.... Selfishness, truth scary accept, fatigue, don‚Äôt know anyone affected virus. parents retired small group friends family members they‚Äôre close to. fact one people lives virus fine convinced parents whole thing blown proportion. lot people see world beyond a$$hole. went food shopping yesterday toddler phone wife, didn‚Äôt even think walked store without mask. guy working deli, stopped told put mask on. mortified forgot, got distracted. reentered (masked) found manager told happy worker brave enough confront good job. thanked started telling get almost daily confrontations people pissed mask requirement. Said call cops couple times. It‚Äôs fucking gross. One reassuring (I think) things tell anti-vaxxers vaccines they've use decades lots evidence they're safe. cry foul odd side effects, data.

There's lot talk three phases trials long take normal course things. I'd really prefer followed here. vaccine arrives Suddenly, without lot fanfare Almost Ready (and think we'd know, great optimistic news sells well bad news days), yes, that's suspicious me.

Anti-vaxxers go conspiracy nuts mainstream roll vaccine causes terrible side effects skipped testing steps. blow vaccinating coronavirus, would give vaccines bad name. might happen anyway, happens knowingly skipped steps, we've created crisis name expediency.

But yeah, works independently tested authorities country give go-ahead, I'll take it. suspect country's health officials might wait proper length trial regardless. someone blasted conspiracy theories bill needs know better - trust FDA big brother bill gates day Good news! mum going nursing home October due Alzheimer's worried visitor ban.

The plan leave furnitures personal belongings reception let staff take care setting room. hopefully let set everything instead.

And BTW; pictures nursing home Facebook page staff wearing face masks. good follow Tegnells advice says face masks help. US 10x death per population worldometer correct. Funny joke plastic masks mouth holes exactly PPE. Can't see comment removed. neither ""uncivil"" political.  seems Bor√•s source new hospitalisations. except maybe 10-20% costumes kids wearing masks. rare. Repugniacans know bad pushing herd immunity.

America fucked I'm gonna go grain here. imagine Trick-or-Treating looks like, like kid, find thinking ""this easily adaptable compliant Coronavirus protocols, probably one holidays we'll able enjoy somewhat care-free fall/winter"":

-It's done outside, automatically meeting one key elements Coronavirus protocols

-Most trick-or-treating groups either siblings parents, groups close friends--two types groups likely already hanging together ""quarantine bubbles"", trick-or-treating together increase risk catching other.

-A lot Halloween costumes naturally incorporate masks, many could use face paint. So: decorate COVID-19 compliant mask match costume. Also: Fauci came past week saying turns masks really necessary socially distanced outdoors, so...masks may necessary anyway environment.

-Dishing candy requires modifications, they're easy modifications make. Keep candy dish distance door hang porch see people come (that way ring doorbell, also ensure encounter instead letting take candy going). Maybe even rig fun contraption (even simple chute door porch landing) deliver candy bag bucket across distance feet. going hand-to-bucket transfer, wear gloves and/or use sanitizer visitors.

-The Trick-or-treat candy exchange FAST. Easily minute unless real talker--and even probably less 5 minutes. Social distancing guidelines emphasize DISTANCE, also duration encounter. social distancing guidelines treat 1-5 minutes dangerous length time.

If incapable trick-or-treating without gathering group 15-20 people asshole-to-elbow other, course inherent compliance trick-or-treating covid-19 protocols goes window. real damn easy safely. No, mean full shutdown. university semester, least. time plan online 4 months ago. Whether schools government failed particularly relevant, fact schools can't opened nobody planned online courses option shut down. sure dangerous streets country, mine travel accidents even close top 10. think Minnesota pretty well done. show dead hospital 14 days positive test case ""resolved"". Helps see active case trends time, we've generally hovered around 5,000 active cases months now. really matter it?

If virus capable resurfacing, stated proven is, difference would make end? [Like terrible, sort leadership. It‚Äôs accurate say complete absence leadership. reason believe flu season actually bad? understand it‚Äôs mild across Southern Hemisphere, even Brazil. Last heard 20% students Wisconsin tested positive but, HEY, need get schools open. difficult fathom stupidity country. 

We stuck Minot, N.D. 4 weeks family medical emergency mind-boggling see apathy there. Drove school 200 kids outside P.E. mask sight. Restaurants open packed. Bars loaded people. I'm sure coincidence COVID booming state... wear mask grind ass patron don‚Äôt think everyone getting ever part plan though, seems we‚Äôve ended up. someone dealt crack pot conspiracies lately Bill know better I‚Äôd sure hell trust FDA Even healthy people get fucked virus though. People seem completely dismiss fact virus targets vital organs, potentially causing permanent damage to; lungs, heart, kidney, etc. 

I‚Äôm really getting sick people using mortality rate vector. I‚Äôm glad little corner Canada handling well, we‚Äôve got fair share anti-masker conservative dummies spewing garbage, got really lucky.  Yeah IFR lower 1.6% though, probably like 0.5% around 1 200 Bill shut fuck lol go make computer last comment - yeah, wrote pieces (I looked clause mentioned typing response - hindsight probably good idea) definitely comes across such.

Either way, fact make good points. wholly agree, make right wrong either. Granted, help system proactively check Constitutionality laws actions, instead complaints must brought court.... least I've seen read history.

My original point (that got away from) branch Government System allowed make decisions something Constitutional Judicial branch. You, me, anyone else interpret Constitution, valid important civil discourse, enforceable ""truth"" legal sense. agree decisions, right (and voice opinions publicly), abide whole system falls apart. would interested reading anything legit that, like take word face value forgive take yours. Last heard antibody count stockholm still less 20%. Herd immunity might explanation downtrend mean time??

I isolation, staying room house. Anything else reduce symptoms get infected get symptoms reduce risk infection anything else.

I may make sense getting paranoid. That's Sub-Saharan Africa level, country Europe anywhere close low. male life expectancy Estonia 73 years. believe Russia 67 years worst Europe. Unfortunately, indoor bars concerts things miss. ""Everything open except two reasons want leave house for."" Source that? AFAIK delivery mechanism somewhat less effective developing immunity flu vaccines. I'm sure much world differs real one, sure prefer dystopia implied response. corporation government makes product hope one day injected everyone world, one good way build confidence answer questions quickly accurately. much require them. would prefer hearing, ""You need know that. Shut trust us."" Great, wasn‚Äôt trying prove anything. 

I don‚Äôt time type us 6 paragraphs link various studies explain you. 

If believe Abbott test 50% infected serovert know isn‚Äôt true NEVER LEAVE HOUSE AGAIN! RISK GREAT! Pools even open state around 40 cases day. (australia)  Coronavirus existing risk, somewhat mitigatable social distancing mask wearing. still risk though. taking unproven treatment. Serious question; clamoring one risk (rightfully) concerned other? think answered wrong place. side effects. kids got first Moderna shot yesterday one sore arm that‚Äôs it. either family 4/4 saline it‚Äôs 2/4 side effect real one sore arm. kids still might side effects, it‚Äôs early, far. (They‚Äôre 20s, actual kids) make difference? knows?

It's plausible serious short term effects might correlate serious long term effects. Modern medicine prevent category dying (so live part long term complications statistics), whereas 1918 medicine severity short term effects would fatal. Canada keep seeing tons cars US license plates! WTF... Stay fuck out. believe people parents kids here. smell BS. also systemic issues POC access quality healthcare. yes, pointing mostly minority children dying valid. title terribly misleading. Exercise cause heart disease, viral infection causes it.

Edit: Downvoted???? Good grief!!!  Hey you‚Äôre getting it! 

As person who‚Äôs skeptical lockdowns wishes could done stop spread: pandemic shown journalists complete garbage companies work less fallible human (which say make mistakes biases). 

I can‚Äôt believe far titles articles actual meat primary sources. gets even worse read academic journals compare science articles written mainstream publications. Proving good test cases - young people catching virus little symptoms. Shows idiocy closing schools stopping sports. Whether ""sitting around drunk"" not, much likely boils similar point ""shut shut SHUT sick tired spending time kids, care die- shit, die least peace quiet!"" 

Dual income, taking care kids, drinking wine, matter likely ""I fed spending time kids need schools open babysit.""  mother-in-law wedding weekend. I‚Äôm sticking principles believe right versus wrong going. wife going it‚Äôs mom. Totally understandable still sucks. Even though know I‚Äôm right thing still feels bad. COVID times going cause lot inter-family drama. Oh, probably years. effective vaccine successfully distributed. Maybe never ones relied buffet profit. wasn‚Äôt staff member went wedding, relative staff member attended.  You‚Äôve got work protect yourself, around won‚Äôt. work fragile people, please mask live carefully. opinion one doctor month ago. Others expressed same. 

Since it‚Äôs become known majority new cases identified open test track. 

I also find somewhat hypocritical Swedes treat opinion random danish doctors pure truth, considering Sweden treat doctors researchers critical authorities strategy. always knew co-workers average intelligence, far selfish/dumb people ever umagined. dumbest ones seem confident ""research"". yesterday, co-worker told wearing mask reduced O2 levels violated OSHA guidelines. pointed OSHA requires masks certain types work... response... ""oh, sure, air polluted. "" dumb fuck, Covid polluting air. amount facts science going sway idiots, depressing. lost respect asshole now. months now

You want spraying antibodies mouth tested safety humans? Idk went college, college, workers campus students.I think single employee 60 small percentage professors. Also I'm sorry life completely devoid social interaction. Easy make shitty fear talking points live reality. 


Edit:

Also parties. club activities sports shut down. go college today, litterally eat, sleep, go class week, zoom class day week, studying, there's litterally nothing do. I'd rather ""risk"" going party sit solitary confinement thumb ass every friday. think scary making be. make sound like college employees dropping dead left right. I'm pretty sure happening correct I'm wrong please. effort put writing words stupefyingly ignorant chain thoughts downright impressive. Yes!!! say, Unleash Jedward! Set upon him! Thanks. He's seven now, that's past. lungs actually pretty good shape, went asthma meds couple years ago.

It's entirely possible prices see closer manufacturing costs, rather prices charged. agree, healthcare system fully nonsense prices, since there's real market, numbers see result insurer/pharma interactions real market interaction. $10,000 number actually price believe one pays, even covered insurance. pharma makes MAB actually website lets apply ""charity"" prices, I'm sure anyone asks gets. point I‚Äôve stopped giving fuck. wife always mask up, social distance, go to....and surrounded people DGAF. anti-mask anti-education. outnumbered outgunned absolute fucking morons. Winter going suck. I'm trying think want Trump hear not.... wonder many angry moms gonna pounding doors demanding candy year. true, another 2020 timeline fun fact disaster would game changer everything. lot scientists also questioned data think they've addressed that. hope they're testing countries, that's China made trial data trustworthy.  talking sued survivors people *chose there*?

I want make sure we're page regard (we probably regard). 121? every life matters. national crisis.   It‚Äôs though. garbage.

The OP agenda check submissions. *""I think hopefully catch hopefully they're games.""* 

Nothing even mention health.  want keep jobs Trump tells release rat poison, will.  new.

It's become brazen now, companies plain view. You‚Äôll fine. diligent PPE.

Schools shouldn‚Äôt open community spread.. are.

Stay safe. Haha haha!! love trump pushes things don‚Äôt want. left starts agreeing immediately! Fraternity part of? sounds like threw drum views. Breath fresh air sub ""You want die, also want wish dead."" costco card anymore sadly. expire fast! understanding frustration! Makes since! dont understand simple would everyone would mask wash hands... social distance much possible keep ur circles small total lock down.... yet hard many people todo. feel maybe nothing understood .... people take serious, others dont people dont care understand make daily choice. Leadership messed beginning. Could different come lead understand virus alll sides constant different ideas science other. know people get tested lol That's old mannequin. read animal flu ‚ÄúSelf-important petulant idiots‚Äù pretty much describes flock brainless, baa-ing bleeting anti-maskers US, üò£ one doesnt see minority matters virus/lack leadership kills them? Everyone wants feel like good, also feels good... honest. used big fan ""give people information let right thing"" philosophy. pandemic driven home people right thing even information. Yeah sorry people want get laid . love anti-maskers try act like believe science thought everyone Reddit licensed medical professional though. that's wrong everyone still lawyer least? issue fit seal. wears won‚Äôt stick face properly it‚Äôs good. inside mask gets accidentally contaminated. Dutch ICU association? exactly do?. There's nothing selfish examining statistics seeing virus completely overblown, understanding aftermath lockdowns far adverse effect lives ever catch COVID. Except huge religious exemptions place appease religious orthodox parties (entering ocean forbidden, going mikveh (small indoor pool basically) allowed, rabbis play the.shofar allowed free travel cities, synagogues keep working pretty high capacity restaurants completely closed, even pickup, delivery allowed). whole lockdown pretty much facade look like they're something appeasing members coalition (especially religious ones hold bibi balls). exaggaration btw, even full concrete details.about lockdown (which starts friday) ministry health info seems way many religious exemptions.


Of course, new, whole pandemic religious parties fighting tooth nail succeeding keep synagogues open religious cities taken brunt hit case-wise, closing establishments left right.

Even covid project manager prevent specific religious group coming uman ukraine known rabbi buried, send letter PM (I think) ukraine. Even fighting vehemently forced abide plan outlining pilgrimage created. 

This course one many failings crumbling government disaster, trust me, nothing united israel right sadly. Maybe put hand sanitizer car reminder? changed

Without masking policy, number cases would likely much higher. seems like semantics me. emergency become enduring crisis, decides that? 

Historically, intent emergency powers designed enable swift broad sweeping actions situation changing rapidly normal governance mechanisms legislation regulatory agency actions address questions raised.

But sufficient time passed kinds bodies address questions decide act -- -- emergency authority lived course.

Emergency authorities substitute governance, they're placeholder allow normal process proceed. 200k dead, stocks up. criminal indictments administration history, stocks up. repercussions Putin bounties US soldiers, etc etc

Its wonder Americans reputation worldwide epicly selfish Thank you; didn‚Äôt compare two. üëç Seems case many countries.  wish something nice say this. top others said, everyone wearing masks properly all. today saw woman line mask around nose. took completely raise voice server. People also gathering friends family without masks. need enforcement consistent messaging leaders. said Yes is. Experts say multitude arguing reason all

The experts using seroprevalence surveys. literally think accept calculations based method blindly argue shouldn‚Äôt trust method.

You literally arguing mutually exclusive positions.

Lol Anti intellectualism Republicans voted Trump. NYT publishing op-Ed titled ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Expect Normal Life Return 2021‚Äù stupid reckless.

A) goes even exasperated public health officials saying. good vaccine gets approved soon, fixes 90% problems mid long term.

B) Even op-Ed‚Äôs thesis possible, telling people ensures much less compliance current safety measures. Saying ‚Äú*maybe* go eat March 2022‚Äù send lot compliant people rails....including myself. He‚Äôs serial purgerer monopolist set back advance technology ten years dirty tricks dishonest behavior. scum, liar, untrustworthy, considered expert topic possible exceptions fraud unethical business practices.


e: [quick history lesson downvoters younger lot people making unemployment job. Wow, surprised reputable sources keep repeating then. won‚Äôt; appreciate information üëç reply comment link since one post working? yet they‚Äôre still dead  Oh man I've dreams I' something normal, semi normal (most recent one cruise) realize one wearing mask, I'm wearing mask... think they're guilt dreams I've going back yard sales, super safe outdoors masks, still worry. Worse Science Fiction? suppose ever read *Frontlines*? *Arisen*? *Hell Divers*? Apparently not.

Although guess could say ""worse"" can't stand together this, must stand apart. It‚Äôs pee bottle COVID positive person Depends various governors keep sending covid patients nursing homes mix frail old folks, like Minnesota NY NJ. Data dump üòë I'm risk giving old people community never come contact virus have? ""Oh well could spread someone spreads another person spreads someone dies!"" Bro ok. greater concerns life right now. 4 people entire state died virus yesterday. people die falling stairs per day average. greater concerns bought dip.  FYI colleges mass testing students. 

If ‚Äúhot-spot‚Äù measured cases, determined positive tests, tied amount tests, obviously college towns hot spots... Go see them! getting there? easy get tested? Tbh, seems statistically small would actively infectious given limited exposure. 

If make sure keep away people would help well. Mask up, wash hands, etc.

I hope careful! know, it‚Äôs shocking much bullshit gets published passes r/coronavirus mods‚Äô low bar ‚Äúhigh quality information‚Äù He‚Äôs kind saying doesn‚Äôt matter whether student athletes get myocarditis all, stop playing football worries. scientist doesn‚Äôt understand human behavior well.

Personally think it‚Äôs real weird America collectively chose Restaurants College Football hill die on. hint invest money, instead dubious phone apps, stronger nation count case emergency ? fire him. may also eligible unpaid leave FMLA FFCRA. Info here: he's eligible, invoke leave tests positive, approve it. types leaves protect job.

I can't find info whether Oklahoma Dept. Health mandated quarantine infected individuals. know state, required employee tell employer employer make others aware around you. also supposed quarantine 10 days. Thanks mean sure, 0 percent NYC is. Also, 50 percent guideline, restaraunts definitely following American* never endorsed presidential candidate 175-year history. year compelled so. lightly.  evidence science show Donald Trump badly damaged U.S. people‚Äîbecause rejects evidence science. devastating example dishonest inept response COVID-19 pandemic, [cost 190,000 Americans middle September. herd immunity...?

If don‚Äôt reopen January, don‚Äôt reopen Summer semester. Even it‚Äôs safe go back March, it‚Äôs logistically difficult justify move ins move outs 7 weeks.  happens vaccine doesn‚Äôt work re-infection possible? never return normal life virus eventually weaken someone comes along mask-as-service business model. ""For $200 per month, u-mask subscription allow access proprietary app charging device keep mask topped up!"" Although entirely accurate information, good comparison, since post 9-11 deaths include civilian deaths Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq. would add US Covid deaths Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi deaths get better comparison. Generation? think Would multiple generations, alive right (that aren‚Äôt killed - e.g. elderly). but...there signs treatment? Like multiple company's far actual vaccine close human clinical trials. cuz see Reddit mean happening. god‚Äôs green earth get upvoted that?? oncologist...?  Here's nice heat map showing per capita deaths across animation showing changed since finally, running 7-day average deaths similar charts site. lose control must control first place I‚Äôm studying become EMT information eventually learn seems pretty cool  living away home college dorms returning home pass virus along loved ones?? agree students trying spread virus anyone could vulnerable. way could leave students campus bubble party whoever care getting infected stay own. clear ship left dock sizable portion college kids going party matter what. either open colleges, create bubble keep away everyone else (probably feasible toying different ideas here) Far less cancer heart attack natural deaths. Yeah it‚Äôs really sad. It‚Äôs really unfortunate nation can‚Äôt get shit together go ahead make generalizations . Sounds like great place.  guesses based glee take deaths people different you.

Though, can't rule maybe country awesome, weird hateful outcast there. There's certainly plenty go around everywhere. 

Or ashamed. certainly, gall someone shitting someplace afraid - anonymous internet mind - reveal he's kind fun super-amusing, let's leave that. exists space lockdowns total denial covid‚Äôs existence privte event, there's 50 people-ban, comment misleading.  Found sociopath. course. Right-wing rocker. play music that‚Äôs 30-50 years date, course you‚Äôre politically conservative. Agreed! feel place thinking social programs good country. makes liberal. Sad countries second nature. 32.7 million \[24.8 million‚Äì42.2 million\] people died AIDS-related illnesses since start epidemic.

9.4 9.8 million people die cancer year.

1.35 million people die car accidents year.

Now I'm stating downplay Corona. respect virus, act accordingly, take unnecessary risks. However, Corona claim many lives simply claim. can't close door wish away, cannot lockdown away, cannot rid way available right now. virus disappear overnight care measures.

Do can, expect morons not, expect whole lot people die. Simple that, sadly. That‚Äôs basically trumps base, ‚Äúconservative Republicans‚Äù  we're even trying. Fucking pathetic. stop counting sometime January.... know. people still may see one Thank god I'm hamster. We‚Äôve never reliable data, much conflicting information. news exciting! Here‚Äôs hoping deaths stay low. low relation increase cases. "
