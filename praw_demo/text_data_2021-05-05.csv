0,2021-05-05," think seems often NSW government quite resistant implement measures. 

Especially since basically rolled back, although say northern beaches spread happened implement measures surprise nice see. 

I guess we’ll see far spread go there. I’m hopeful hasn’t spread far won’t another northern beaches. fight COVID: 

1. Find large gatherings
2. Release bees actual lockdowns months majority states things opened far normal traffic 2019 flip switch minute masks go. 

I went business calling people two time based capacity limit pandemic started monday night aside masks 100% normal operations 

So I'm sure lockdowns talking strange America, seeing punching bag pandemic awhile. really need focus ending thing, I'm confident 4th July weekend going hell party. 

I really worry global community though. situation India scary. hope removal patent protections really helps stop spread allows countries begin large scale vaccinations. good PR US ends successful, need it. That's fine care. I'm talking politicians scientific experts look things bigger picture. AZ 6% effective preventing infection SA variant, 10% effective preventing disease. 

Sinopharm 36% 56% effective. 

http://www.healthdata.org/node/8584 No. Moderna Pfizer extremely similar similar performance vitro variants. I’d personally expect equal protection Moderna vaccine. say name? cause controversy? study provide data efficacy Novavax vaccine preventing severe disease hospitalization, ""one important factors determining usefulness vaccine,"" said Dr Peter English, retired consultant communicable disease control former chair British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee. worry hit credit factor?  staggering stats posting daily basis. What's hospitalization rate? hospitals already full capacity? person offered job Japan yr ago whose trying enter country almost year now. summed perfectly. Watching covid news Japan depressing esp country developed is.

I can’t begin describe saddened Japan’s government incompetence. It’s literally costed job US wait Japan “open up.”

Too bad didn’t pick apply job literally almost Asian country cries california

imo, i've always pro reopening schools, remote learning possible good option short intervals person feasible hope teachers understand sentiment let kids ""study"" instead traditional class. surprise day really good rest reset people.   enough matter wouldnt call thousands businesses business fine Oh WH briefing?

Make need lockdowns less likely. 

That argument way government second outbreak ANZAC Day lockdown, measures place need lockdown. 

So extension...  also way easier logistics-wise stored regular refrigerators. Makes angry front center conversation since beginning. 

We campaigning improving health nutrition exercise year. Would saved many lives. 

We commercials masks vaccines warning people eat well exercise.   Nice see us staying 50k new cases peak days week. Astonishing, web presence reads like private blog. nonetheless, hold key got Moderna Biontech millions Dollars. That's case. state, state moratorium going expire part year. January 1st, tenants needed paid October-December face eviction. months March-September would still covered.

Lo behold, dead risen. People paid 9 months suddenly 3 months payment middle December. Christmas miracle!

Then state (and eventually Feds) extended eviction mortoria January 1st March 30th...and June 30th. single penny come tenants again. well ""suddenly"" gone dry again!

Nevermind new electronics, new furniture, expensive car mods. Looks like things important paying rent. gain function research, great time send gain function researchers india enhance knowledge. Dr. Ben Bikman's book Get Sick covers nicely. 28% percent according BBC story. bad. 11% California. We've outdoor gatherings even without masks month now. talking about? Well done! keep them. NY fine without people abandoned city. need show proof. long sign declaration covered.

The landlord may fight it, honestly trying get court date (with dubious question whether even win) rarely worth it. least I'm making shit like do. sub ridiculous auto ban bots. nothing shit posters like you.

You are, though. claiming India directly donated 200 million vaccines. aren't. [They producing vaccines COVAX pays think great thing, fine, thank America paying America donated billions COVAX nation.

It also noted India get CLOSE 200 million mark, banned exports vaccines get COVID crisis control.  really pisses México struggling even begin vaccinate adults 50+ years read shit US. Talk privilege stupidity. original vaccines still neutralize variants? Straw man argument. knows maybe India, Thailand, South Korea, Japan take advantage this. Also, mask mandates (indoor outdoor) gone, good. Yes might enforced. governors end mandates, EVERYONE wanting take off, especially fully vaccinated. Enforcing gonna work lot pushback. Probably much better South African one given vitro studies context: Cambodia experiencing massive spike cases right now, though upward trend daily case growth yet exponential, still pretty steep. almost certainly surge deaths, measure probably way government Cambodia save face. They’re independent biotech company far remember claiming anything American major cities ""better developed"" Chinese major cities. discuss ""quality life"", whatever means you.

You seem arguing merits oppressive autocracy trying deny Chinese people live oppressive autocracy. trying convince yourself? I'm friends married couple waiting get vaccine, despite working public-facing jobs, share car easily schedule vaccines together. roommate accountant who's lashed computer end busy season bother scheduling appointments. sent three link state's walk-up vaccination sites. got Shot #1 done last week. incorrect. referring Biden said, Gov Wolf. body crime. find millions people dead since covid19 control. saying they've vaccinated everyone? even competent?  report saying *of people breakthrough covid infections* likely SA variant. mean vaccine ineffective it, somewhat less effective strains (there caveats study, find old threads). Uhhh. thats take happened last 15 months? 

Yikes. I'm sure mean ""virtually breakthrough cases,"" CDC reported 9,245 breakthrough infections, would say trivial number, also likely under-count, vaccinated people less likely seek testing even symptomatic.

Vaccinated people still spread sense people use condoms still get pregnant: protection effective, 100%. message around levels safety change people get vaccinated. fully vaccinated person Israel lot safer fully vaccinated person India. talking about? July trials phase 1/2 data read looked really impressive. That’s US government tried buy BioNTech. seem discount that. discount companies using billions dollars mass manufacture vaccines phase 1/2 data read outs. data read outs US government buy vaccines try buy actual damn company. Gee whiz wonder why? want give credit operation warp speed, fabulous operation Pfizer manufacturers begging assistance getting vaccine components? companies still don’t vax, maybe hint insanely risky Pfizer/BioNTech use billions dollars manufacture vaccine early? Hit right meow  Early on, back March-May 2020, didn’t think asymptomatic spread extremely common? need understand excess mortality long means naturally long period normal mortality rates. fact things appear normal means people dying still. bad good. It’s national interest. Chinese cheers China flexes muscle international stage. Nothing wrong it. China protects market IPs fiercely. HuaWei shared 5G IP world yet? hasn’t shouldn’t. well meaningless others, pretty obvious talking lol. need play semantic games imo Yup...we wait everyone get 1st dose. employer/company 100 employees. 2 us gotten vaccinated. got first shot January BC. second shot sight personal family reasons move Arizona. got second shot two days ago. Makes wonder first shot even produced antibodies.  would say essentially guaranteed point, likely end month. Total cases pretty bad metric though, requires testing positive uneven countries lot reasons.  Like NCAA would allow things. much greed April 19 last date states adults before, opened that. simpler terms, latest date adults could become eligible take it.

So earliest possible time second dose would May 10 17, even passed yet.

Better make estimate couple weeks that, definitely possible. Great news. hope USA starts producing we're ready roll without much backlog fall. Enough categories ages/risks. remember people claiming pandemic gonna cause baby boom. Note: 1st world countries actually pay ""1st world prices"" Pfizer vaccine, example, United States paid around 20 bucks per dose Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccines, compare Pfizer's Prevnar 13 vaccine cost 200 bucks per dose take 5 doses child. Rest assured though, expect paying full price boosters.  get 80% vaccinated 75% effective, 40% vulnerable, herd immunity. sucks. I’m ok calling things human rights. support social programs.

US signed deals lot companies many vax still  Right. meant abandoned city time need deserve reap benefits revival. Dang...I feel bad
I got 2nd sore arm slight headache. That’s insane part this, somehow Biden coming **from left of** EU. fuck happen? read Biden shipping doses US-manufactured BioNTech/Pfizer. Hopefully start filling gap. God, nightmare everybody involved. I'm happy live country we're set get vaccinated soon. Everyone's suffered much  likely get sooner get doses coming in. know Alberta government said move schedule get vaccines. CMC, chemistry, manufacturing control generally part RND no. Lol. least pharma company I've worked before. patent protections pulled back would expedite process lot vaccines could manufactured generically around globe. looking like probably case rather dependence charitable donations excess doses humanitarian aid thats lacking original projections. difficult think 22/early 23 good estimate depending country provided able secure manufacturing locations, inoculate people efficiently. Naw homie. Keep indoors scared, I'll living summer. fairness, lack intellect pretty big impact handling Covid. So, guess turnabout fair play. irony people died contracting Covid due lack vaccine died blood clots. pretend significant investment process profit - driven corporations extremely disingenuous. 
 
Scientific progress (including medicine) iterative process every achievement relies large pool researchers include government funded scientists. 
 
But fact NIH finding contributed research underlying vaccines medicines mean vaccine would exist without corporate funding occurred.  even called baby killer said aborted baby parts it

Is 90s? lie. Warpspeed buyer behalf US Government, nothing development. time Warpspeed announced May 15, 2020 Germans already vaccine working testing.

Take horse's mouth, Yahoo :-)

 [The CEO Pfizer Developing Vaccine Record Time June. Kept socializing ppl otherwise took advantage whatever open (my state somewhat strict). Worked fine I’m vaccinated. ask virtually breakthrough cases people vaccinated, hell vaccinated people still spread covid? They're vanishingly unlikely even test positive. Forget messaging. go straight forced vaccinations. Er, recall one study suggested UK strain least 20% lethal. course course, another study came week saying same. obvious late 2020 already.

There's reason US delay 2nd dose. Fauci pretty explicit: really critical immune response.

Delaying 2nd dose production schedules US would made real difference rollout speed longer term. best moved things days. would complicated getting people back second dose.

They fully expect vaccine stopgap. That's reason US ordered much technically needs (if one vaccine proves less effective, could theory administer second one boost immunity). 

That's reason boosters planned right now. Vaccines silver bullet /r/coronavirus likes think as. expect virus point render ineffective. 

There's two ways crush this:

1. High vaccination rates globally.
2. Enough measures place keep virus control. What's happening India Brazil right really fucks globe. virus replicating rapidly gives ton opportunity evolve. Trillions trillions opportunities day.

Neither important other. 

We also know date vaccine become less effective. could slow linear. could June 14, 2021 13:25 GMT. know days, weeks, maybe months effects show up, since telemetry virus based effect (people getting sick, people dying).

That's real reason keep wearing mask. time anyone says ""hey, maybe need rethink this""... we'll already serious problem. That's politics negligence. That's tracking viruses work.

Keeping locked hurting Covid will. yea im pretty sure youre reading graph wrong lol. return normal amounts excess deaths march 2021, march 2020, 2 months, best, year would cruel drop Covid July? /s that's half standard deviation... that's huge. Can't believe downvoted. quit consider terms employment acceptable.

What, can’t manage working full time job running zoom school two kids? Shouldn’t kids!

Bars strip clubs opened schools here. Government made priorities clear.

What idiot would children year? didn’t. Pfizer manufacturers BioNTech’s vaccine. Pfizer/BioNTech already manufactured vaccines prior completion clinical trials, gambling vaccine would work. early clinical trial data really encouraging thus US government signed guaranteed contract. early data read wasn’t encouraging, would US signed contract? Doesn’t mean Pfizer/BioNTech took risk? It’s still interesting people totally opposite reactions vaccines. second Pfizer dose 4/30 felt nothing aside hours muscle soreness shot area. first dose. mean naturalized Germans yeah. Cancel upcoming college football season duck/deer hunting season unless/until U.S. reaches 70% vaccination. we’ll see stronger resolve  Yeah true. Also Pfizer, I've read, may efficient coding mRNA. Moderna's first doses 250mcg, can't imagine side effects those. Hmm.. living close us border, popping part monthly routine. Yet I’m sure quite ready that. Especially given people BC can’t even travel outside region. Yeah... no. Go away. Canada ready yet. half country dealing worst wave since beginning pandemic. Hospitals Delhi getting 4 hours oxygen supply max raise alarms replenishment. Imagine calling emergency, every 3 hours.

You lying. Plain simple. get credit, also backstopped free $2b put option received via warp speed. may understand pre-fusion stabilized s-1 spike, seem get value warp speed provided them. think there's sorts cause optimism general, picture muddier look certain regions. think deep south potential outbreaks year, horrendous uptake numbers zero mitigation. severe, especially terms death, they'll exist. Perhaps it'll actually cause people get vaccinated. Perhaps they'll pray gods vaccination rather embrace. Either way, hard see region increasing numbers. made Jonas Salk famous inventing polio vaccine, patent it. Probably much impact, might even improve response. strategy done without understanding likely happen.

Thankfully, going expected. Black Death 1350’s killed 30-60% Europe’s population. Thanos snap bad. expect college students low-skilled workers homes rent landlords exist. pony tens thousands dollars buy apartment house move out? Interesting story. timeline important.

In 1980's recommended vaccinate children well Merck/GSK recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. However, vaccine rather expensive 23 USD, something lot countries could afford. new Indian biotechnology company founded 1993, Shanghai Biotechnics, approached Western company technology transfer transfer, told said. happened around decade later 1993. 2002, 9 years later, company managed obtain pre-qualification 1 USD recombinant Hepatitis B vaccine. 7 years later, 2009, managed sell 120 million doses vaccine we're bought Sanofi year. 

We need COVID-19 vaccines coming years. story precedent, sharing IP absolutely nothing current pandemic, enough doses produced entire global Fauci sure best source info government agency ole whatsisname charge.  makes landlords parasites? provide service otherwise one would able rent anywhere.  look countries UK/US/Canada? hope thing solved 2025? (2025 exaggeration, still) I’m open argument waiving patents would help; however, may want different example (or elaborate further) since pointed monopoly type hepatitis vaccine doesn’t really seem fit situation covid since covid vaccines produced over, India producing home grown vaccine well rebranded AstraZeneca vaccine. There’s also Russian Chinese vaccines. West may places making mRNA vaccines, aren’t developing countries would prefer since require cold storage places like India can’t reliably provide. Technically correct, rarely used way scientists typically measure distances light-years. measure parsecs. Lumping first dose people category bit misleading though. already know takes ~2 weeks first dose really see effects. would interesting see many cases come weeks post first dose many that. suspect number much higher wait 2 weeks first dose Rats, 0 2 Plenty landlords day jobs well. Someone paying rent property mortgaging exactly make Mr. Mrs. Moneybags. Sure issue lie warp speed benefit pfizer. kids careful specifically sake adults, would continue careful adults vaccinated? I’m confused cast needs wear masks offstage they’re required vaccinated anyways... FDA needs hurry grant full approval Pfizer full approval much easier tighten screws get people vaccinated Full, overflowing overwhelmed. even midst this, countrymen found ways scam others - 'cash beds' scam unearthed couple days ago Bangalore. Yes know plenty people refuse get it. Friends, family, etc. even we've known people got hit hard still 'feel right'. I'm living home told I'm stupid guinea pig (I'm scheduling first dose tomorrow time.) Actually found brother it, feel 'that bad' even testing positive say shit anyone house. told today shit (he also wear masks). can't believe family sometimes. interval vaccines. reason lack supply two mRNA vaccines better... Next conscripting useful employees help countries.

Yes, conscripting people go field assist. different drafting people military even jury duty, crazy. Hell congress order testify it, yes, go, arrive prepared info want held contempt congress. ""I busy"" ""I can't afford it"" excuses.

We wars, time need. Defense Act among many laws actually cover this.

That would make huge difference.

Is elsewhere? legit concerns antivax? Seems like case widespread quarantine fatigue, government overconfidence beaten vaccines way, newer powerful variants.  realize Canada higher percentage vaccinated (and doses per capita) EU, right? 7 countries world population 1 million vaccinated larger percentage population Canada, 4 relying Russian Chinese vaccines. would argue Canada actually 4th best vaccine rollout world thus far, behind Israel, UK, US.

If want criticize rich country’s vaccine rollout, I’ll point Australia, New Zealand, Japan. None 5% population vaccinated, 6x less Canada.

I agree though, fully vaccinated people able cross border. logistics probably still worked out, wouldn’t surprise Canada using border leverage vaccines. good. Yet everywhere go run hardcore anti vaxxers ""opinions"" vaccines hoax unsafe. get it. says September well haven’t reached heard immunity didn’t drop ball smashed ground. true highest vaccination rates world 1st dose fully vaccinated. Combine unreported cases, herd immunity vaccines + natural infections.

Canadians 1st dose (currently 35%) allowed come proof vaccination. 

There huge rush re-open actually closed 1 year 2 months us cross border families suffering. 

We've done get political posturing governments putting politics humanity fully vaccinated willing wear masks quarantine see loved ones.

Canada's economy America's economy hugely suffering closure, even mention economies cross border cities like Buffalo Niagara Falls. 

There reason open Americans fully vaccinated Canadians 1st dose/fully vaxxed. Yes feel way you. I’ve hermit since March 13, 2020. sacrificed friendships good bit mental health. Today, two weeks post 2nd dose (meaning vaccine reached full efficacy) went picked Mexican food dinner. wore mask though.  And, least SoCal, nobody wears damn mask, everyone eating restaurants, etc. something must working isn’t major wave already.  participate trials? got vaccine within couple hours county’s first injection wasn’t December 22nd you’re quite far ahead me. Please enlighten us specifically Justin Trudeau government could done improve vaccine procurement.

Okay let's start fact Justin Trudeau government paid double countries got vaccines (still getting) months later is... botched rollout acquirement. 

Or Trudeau pursue Canadian domestic vaccine production partnership India, world's largest vaccine producers... instead picked Chinese (Cansino) instead, lost. 

How though? government email showing much paid late AZ shipment (paying countries like Israel getting late always delayed e.g. AZ Moderna) Pissed lockdowns vaccine appointment? Would situation Liberals delivered us vaccines January February? email shows recently Sept 24, Astra scheduled begin arrive end March. Deadly one best rollouts vaccines 1st doses world, G20, USA, UK, France, Germany, Turkey, Italy, Mexico ahead you. Even US UK pretty much countries huge domestic production. 

Mind you, AZ Canada received 1.5m loan US, rest COVAX. bet Biden send save Canada safely re-open border. Source? Source? Where's source? source that?

Literally google neil Ferguson model people normally would dying 2021 2022 2023 died early 2020. Check Walgreens.com Saturday mornings update availability. Pfizer able get appointment Sunday-Thursday-ish then. Vietnam go get another shot? real bitter thing impacts people close people rely financially.

Exactly! *also* leads dead people deaths despair years life lost. can't believe people still pretending that's something ignored.

There's real gap country people struggling get people comfortably sit WFH job never worry they're going pay bills. mRNA vaccines stop spread nearly 100%, AZ J&amp;J vaccines also stop spread similar rates effectiveness, right? can't see wouldn't.  oh, know i’m way left average liberal. i’m pretty sure i’m somewhere anarchist socialist area look political chart 🤷🏻‍♂️ think that's Australia basically completely spared, I've got bridge sell rural Queensland  think approved quickly actually. Hell, shocked results available Boston opens 8/22. Got second shot couple days ago really kicked ass! Felt like flu day half. Can’t wait tail come in! I'm glad got first Pfizer shot last week. worst side effect increased fatigue days, getting better. Hardly even sore arm. I'm curious see we'll need booster point second shot. hope so! 20% difference fixed next months :)

Vaccinate careful avoid this:

[The 30 worst hit countries Covid-19 pandemic according excess mortality 2020 April 2021 - 

(the excess mortality US extracted CDC) Darn first moderna shot zero side-effects. Second shot laid flat, call work. 103 degree fever, migraine, insanely tired. Lasted ~24hrs. Absolutely worth I'd knowing that's waiting, suck lol  know. i'm somewhat exaggerated personal humor. i've literally stayed home 15 months. i'm fully vaxxed. i'm done. good luck everyone else. music festivals scheduled September November North America (with thousands outdoor attendees) likely get delayed? party pooping iniquity. problem science reporting. scientist says ""we know X"" media person repeats ""X false"". trials tell us much vaccines prevented spread, people said know prevented spread (not technically true), repeated outright incorrectly vaccines prevent spread.

mRNA vaccines prevent spread nearly 100%. NH: Good Job! 100% opening end April

VT: Awesome! even completely drop indoor mask mandates end June

MA Last Week: 70%? guys suck. Check back August Boston wait Labor Day. Also, NYC stop bringing up!

But honestly, encourage people vaccinated state can't open last worst performing states already open? People MS incentive get one people told opening last country regardless vaccination people might well wait (well getting covid...) Personally, vaccinated since I'm asshole, definitely blame someone busy schedule waiting couple weeks know impact get back normal life. Hot dam that's good news. going tinder profile. Yay getting second dose tomorrow!! make less effective wait long? explained somewhere kept bay past year roof?  I’ve read articles people previously covid stronger immunity one dose vaccine covid previously got doses. Curious see plays out. I’m still getting second dose even though virus previously  safe go friend’s apartment May 15th? me, friend, boyfriend, friend’s mom. friend mom live other.

My friend mom fully vaccinated. fully vaccinated May 18th, three days shy May 15th. boyfriend fully May 21st, six days shy May 15th.

Yeah they’re discriminated like immigrants probably much less compared Muslim immigrant groups . music festivals scheduled September November North America (with thousands outdoor attendees) allowed happen? lot words make point entirely completely unrelated anything said. Clearly medical patents need reformed, literally nobody talking that, argument point. 
 
It simple statement fact *as market run today*, major pharmaceutical companies invest billions dollars research drug development. Apparently want argue spending could better distributed also make unreasonable profits government funded research, would arguing one. can't possibly believe current medical innovation exclusively result public research.  
 
The fact matter investment exists important process today developing bringing medications market. better mechanisms could put place? Absolutely are. now. Risking current functioning current system without viable replacement place believing work incredibly naive. 
 
I 100% idea system reformed transitioned run public benefit. unfortunately currently pipe dream, responsible people make policy decisions based pipe dreams. time Ahhh we're still ""botched vaccine rollout"" even though one best vaccine rollouts world, better EU actually production capability too?

Please enlighten us *specifically* Justin Trudeau government could done improve vaccine procurement.

And genuine thank US states reaching help vaccinate neighbours. reached point huge surplus vaccines need reaching assist since clear it'll cost citizens nothing. objectively good thing everyone I'm going least bit perturbed weird pride issues. dont think understood im saying. federal government recently started utilizing incentives, aka carrots &amp; sticks. point new phase push % Try really isn’t coming left-leaning sub lmao isn’t good enough way prove vaccination moment - CDC already took “vaccine cards” due worries forgery. 

There’s harm waiting another couple months people vaccinated sides border. Best news heard week. It’s almost like you’re desperate give operation warp speed credit underlying reason. Wonder could be? also got really upset pointed dramatic change rate vaccinations saw late January, resistant credit given distribution plan implemented late January. wonder could make someone illogical want give credit blank check funding program dramatic change vaccine distribution? still haven’t answered blame fomenting half country resist vaccinated too. I'd try health systems. also CA, 60% BioNTech/Pfizer. gotta protect plague rats. I'll able hold breath forever vaccine? Awesome! There's generally blood type considerations among disease exposures (should extend vax reactions) thing stops unvaccinated guy gun, good guy vaccine gun. it’s “failed rollout” want border stay closed protect Americans. 

There’s need rush opening border, done certain number sides vaccinated. Vaccine passports going good solution. Bay area CA Look real-world data. UK using 12 weeks doses deaths declined 99% peak ( faster decline cases). period USA deaths declined 78%. 
Health Canada absolutely right thing. lots boots licked tonight. taken zero scientific articles analysis subreddit? doesnt matter young healthy, end day vaccines meant greatly reduce spread hospilizations/deaths caused covid flu. so, greatly decrease chance dangerous variants popping killing people. MRNA vaccine delivery method researched, developed, tested proven safe 30 years, recent successes resulting covid vaccine today. safe effective ... much getting covid naturally spreading others.

After second one, mild fever felt right rain passed. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 geez words  none. glad Pfizer option.  [We already something similar It’s virtue signalling point. Cool Everyone compelled either two reasons already gotten vaccine now. another strategy want look getting remainder done.

Every day working home, social events cancelled. surprised I've lost 7 IQ points monotony last year.

Yeah, thinking trying visit finally September think it'll still closed. answer argument is: one. Even one treated, eventually would work rich/powerful people public outcry would big people/company responsible finding cure would manufacture general population. 


See: Johnson, Magic HIV example. Hospitals fully occupied since weeks. beds available here. Forget ventilators. days ago 20 people died hospital ran oxygen. Elections held last week April. Hundreds officials involved died. Politicians conducted huge rallies. masks. social distancing. shitshow. know taking article, ""good news"", considering high risk Dad (70's, Diabetes Parkinson's), given State never hit herd immunity (Ohio, around 40% vaccinated 15-20K shots day last checked) can't help feel worried seeing variants impact vaccine, even bit. worried, right?  vaccines still going work keep Dad safe, right? got first Moderna shot last weekend day hella sore arm, felt achy general ""don't touch skin"" feeling sick.

Next day rolled around, though, perfectly fine, soreness almost gone. Damn lucky  makes feel better sit fever throwing Pfizer second dose 🥲  can’t afford raising kids believe paid work important extreme fear future


Why positive sign? Op clearly playing politics here, especially ""Trudeaus failed vaccine rollout"" comment.

That being, personal standard makes sense open ""vaccine passport"" type things vaccine made available adult wants it. really fair open vaccine passports inside country, people 40 offered vaccine people age 18-39 can't get one yet. there's baby boom reasonable come end crisis, economy full-swing recovery optimism high.  Yes, possibly long-term protection. increasing interval great way getting population protected quicker. downside, UK policy extending interval saved many lives.

The trials used 4 week interval that's minimum might actually give benefit, whilst allowing results available many weeks sooner.

There's theoretical basis say 12-16 week interval less effective 4 week interval, compliant way Pfizer vaccine licensed. Lmao feel you. Recently got jabbed choice get AstraZeneca. vaccine’s vaccine, option mRNA ones would’ve nice 😔 Im kinda liking security patching model vaccinations. It’s basically everywhere USA. 

I got second shot today one mega centers run department health florida. empty. asked much longer keep operating… answer “ closing 25th”. 

It’s still going available local pharmacies, I’d imagine even start problems low demand storage requirements making impractical. M2V tanking exactly problem lies, no?

Inflation happening right money printing balanced reluctance spend. However, government control printing money, could control money velocity, easily destroy money printed. pandemic ""over"" people start spending money back usual levels, M2V go back up, without counterbalance.

Things going get bad money currently locked financial economy starts entering real economy, via massive stock gains retail investors enjoying recently.  Got alternative system still scientists work hard research drugs? Preferably involving forced labor, motivating. That’s good point, maybe solution problem build new generic manufacturing site locally. 

It doesn’t feel like efficient solution though. I’m driving cross country, can’t believe amount people see mask, outside inside! Even employees aren’t wearing many states!

I’ve occasionally asked they’re vaccinated look like 2 heads usually say, vaccine WAY NEW experimental. 

“Rolls eyes” *Alt right genocide theory wielder enters chat* Patents eternal. modifications newest patent small, producers make drug old one? Taking example insulin, people want generic latest modifications actually significant. companies billion dollar companies want what, charge vaccine profit them? They're getting subsidiaries governments recognized hard work, household names certainly now. unrelated selective patent enforcement unless government money came clause.  distancing masks help you. Wait days get tested don’t symptoms, sure. get symptoms, tell doctor. 

I would complain doctor’s office too. NYC least suspected covid patients separate protocol. mean, expect continent slowest? trial results expected really, really soon covid 19 really risk young people supposed breed. pattern population booming seen wars disease effectively killing young people. maybe reason. mean directly next to; chairs spaced somewhat apart. probably technically 1.5m apart I'm really, really bad estimating distances. Sounds fun, really needed? 

Reports show BioNTech vaccine (similar Moderna's) works fine B.1.351 think random close encounters strangers point virus talk lol fever immune system trying develop antibodies spike protein, immune system might stronger others previously exposed COVID stronger reaction. weaker immune system, might take longer might notice right away. Yeah, think mainly Switzerland producer active ingredient Europe iirc sat next guy 20 minutes? physical distancing? people test +/- 10 points depending day. 


So average covid patients tested minimum daily variation. still huge deal. actually got mine microchip. I’m hoping interfere 5G waves telling burn things /s always cynical comment Reddit matter study. 7 IQ points large, even mostly attributable things like bad sleep, every covid patient still able sleep well months track still big deal . suppose question South Africa large supply lipids hoping use one idling facilities, would want sell getting vaccines return? suppose could use money buy vaccines, shortage supply 80% vaccines already ordered richer nations, may help goal vaccinate population. 

Note: heavily medicated may nonsensical. Sleep beckons me.  main people benefited moratorium people wanna sit apartment day chain smoking cigarettes (which longer anything about) racking $30K rent, tell go fuck stroll lobby get dozen Amazon packages. property $200K since started, that's gut units destroyed. fuck landlords, right?

I even tend noise complaints anymore. call fucking cops. That’s really good! workplace medical field reached 60/40 60 vaccinated 40%  Ok cool. know 2 people died, point is, affects everyone differently.  Except Switzerland supply moderna little bit pfizer. whole family gotten moderna far, lets see case well next tuesday. think we'll probably go way Expanse eventually. get basic income, soylent die, free apartment size large walk closet. seems like logical endgame populated, tech progressed far enough really cuts job opportunities minimum. 

Not saying good outcome, dont sound real fun. friend works hospital don’t require covid vaccines think flu shots ridiculous half time shot doesn’t even cover right strain you. One day need go back life again. subsidised US government provide kind super powers vs. German Federal government missing something? happen rich countries reach vaccination goal? give small countries chance take vaccines hoard third fourth etc. shots. Question: went doctor earlier week guy good time. Like sitting waiting room together solid 20 minutes entire time wounded like guy run marathon. Lo behold today today COVID tracking app let know exposed day went doctor (I went else day) I'm risk. wearing FFP2 masks ordinary symptoms yet. irony? doctors office get put vaccine list, I'm increased risk complications due medical condition. 

How much longer y'all recon left live? I’m expert either, we’ve reports year facilities delivering less expected capacities shortages. 

The volumes involved actually surprisingly small, issue load lipids South Africa manufacturing capacity could solve single cargo flight.  prefer sputnik Ditto. waited almost hour past appt time first dose - single person today went back second. Vaccines effective natural immunity, disease may cause long lasting disability, cases = opportunities mutation. Also death, less freedom folks cant vax, etc. etc.

Let's enjoy looser restrictions come continue prioritize public health, aye? sense fumbling last 10 yards  risk zero, yes additional strain.

&amp;#x200B;

Since agree risk zero, especially variants floating around, strain plus additional covid-related strain. Pretty sure viral load wrong term here. Condoms pills thing. 
Why would people get pregnant middle pandemic? know pregnants part risk group right? Let's assume risk zero fully vaccinated travel (just sake argument) ... case concerned influx travelers coming would overwhelm existing health system due non COVID injuries illnesses seen hospitals, emergency rooms, etc. ? you’re already fully vaccinated still get next shot right? drive Uber post like somebody serious chip shoulder.

I'm pressing X doubt. Yes, typically happens long run.

Though often crossing new species, useful mutations increase transmissibility lethality time, virus still adapting new host (changing key proteins make cell entry easier adapt reproductive cycle new host.) 

For virus unfortunately, selective pressure less lethal low. People already infectious symptoms show early stages. Whatever happens almost meaningless virus' success spreading. almost selective pressure become less lethal (thankfully also none become lethal). major selective pressure currently becoming transmissible and, more, get around immunity (from prior infection vaccination). Yes, every dose comes free idiot. never heard anyone say pandemic would last summer. Florida would like word you… current hospital resources barely handle current domestic case load, let alone additional vaccinated Americans heavily unlikely chance transmission. still non-zero risk point.

&amp;#x200B;

Wait months, hospitals close danger triage status, makes sense let vaccinated individuals super low-risk. Right now, can't afford additional super low-risk people enter.

Also, currently B.167 variant (Indian) present borders. current studies moment transmission variant currently available vaccines. Doesn’t make sense people already COVID antibodies. Statistically, one dose people COVID offers better protection 2 doses people never COVID. 

The 2nd dose isn’t fun take, harsher reaction first. reason I’m taking 2 shots completed vaccine card it’s bullshit unnecessary. threat fully vaccinated Americans pose non partially vaccinated Canadians? get sense mean see John's Hopkins. one counting people die home searching hospitals... real issue unfortunately trade secrets. Opening patents allow greater innovation almost definition, without sharing trade secrets folks wasting time re-learning existing production methods. fairness there's least need. Tourism suffered major hit year non-negligible impact Canadian economy. 98.9% survival rating (or whatever say)

It's true though, probably even higher that. people want vaccine, super cool. don't? That's fine, they're get immunity eventually anyway. Keep moving either way. right bodily autonomy? Similar abortion debate, whether one person's body undergo something save another person's life. Lots click bait news lately variants model taken Oxford Uni Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. 

The research behind vaccine heavily publicly funded, result license manufacturing AZ requires it’s sold “cost” duration pandemic would cross licensed people like Serum Institute. 

That seems like better model free patent waiver. 

Fat lot good done AstraZeneca, can’t see anyone else rushing follow them. Nice Yup. first booked middle May, second September. people still eligible vaccine, still 50+ areas (unless live hotspot, low 18+) . month super big deal though end it, **anyone 18+ Ontario finally eligible vaccine**. Fingers crossed goes well, fall another lockdown (we're third one currently). One wifes family members owns rental properties. learned ever look getting rental property, would mid-high quality rental. rentals affordable areas, end worst fucking people planet renting them. Dogs destroying rooms, people deciding stop paying rent, doorknobs stolen house... insane. Yes, going increase overall money supply lead inflation later unless steps taken reduce money supply.

Thanks interesting question. I'm 35 live population-dense area (near Los Angeles), would think I've gotten flu point life, suppose can't certain. handful countries better (Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, etc.) remarkably behind us vaccinations remain careful long time.

BC better Washington Alaska, two states borders. Ontario better Michigan Minnesota borders. Nova Scotia added restrictions ensure get bad; whole Atlantic Canada better North-Eastern American states border/are nearby to.

I think dumb tho. He's doubling antics.  7. It’s EXpeRiMEntAl! company CEO recognized thread Covid anyone else started development vaccine, finished record time saving millions lives profit work?

Great hear, I'm sure encourage companies work vaccine next pandemic wait two weeks full immunity. feel you. Australia even rolled many allocations yet... we're fried point pre-Covid. Unlike Covid, HepatitisB global pandemic, shut countries killed millions year. Pre-Covid, vaccines took years, decades even, make - time spent waiting. Waiting grants, waiting regulatory approvals, waiting various govt bodies local, national international levels get time look application approve. trials. get large group give vaccination placebo to. wait. Wait enough people get infected either trial placebo group statistical tests enough power say vaccine worked, there's difference, vaccine made easier get infected. case covid, money already ready, grants need written. Govt bodies drop everything else there's vaccine application plate give application priority. trials - people trial groups caught covid matter weeks months. take decades. addition, Merck Glaxo also took decades develop vaccines. Shantha much faster.
Also, ""Shanghai Biotechnics"", that's probably autocorrect. Border states really important, no,when air travel thing. Especially Canadians quarantine upon return regardless. Exactly, lots people problem getting vaccine put forth ton effort get it. someone giving shots walked door door they'd roll sleeve setup appointment wait hour said appointment get shot.    Yes Canada really far behind countries. don’t know many people first dose here. Considering much taxpayer money shoved vaccines, much needed, giving monopoly private company 2 decade bit overkill best use taxpayer money. think need IHME-style modeling here. ""At rate"" premise almost certainly going hold.  military one thing, urge increase levy rich potentially dangerous. 

The rich people already pay lot tax revenue country (top 1% pays total national income tax raised bottom economic engine -- capital, international flows -- hurt source public revenues, thus, people.

this shit ain't easy ""eat rich,"" simplistic think      article says they're J&amp;J? lying really make feel better? Thank kind words. spoke parents yesterday said son recovering well. Idiots sums up. definitely summed well workers paid work perform. amount agreed to. point?  70%+ still well required.

70% *would* required *with high vaccination rates change baseline transmission rates.*

The reproductive rate (R) pathogen function baseline reproductive rate (R0) rate immunity population, function vaccination rates vaccine efficacy. bring epidemic control getting R 1. purpose, lower vaccine uptake, higher efficacy needs be. Similarly, contagious virus, higher efficacy needs be.

Unfortunately, high rates vaccine hesitancy combined rising number variants contagious *and* vaccine-resistant may spell trouble short term. already reason concerned US might reach herd immunity threshold even assumption vaccines work equally well variants. Countries relying AZ J&amp;J might even bigger problem.

(Thankfully, mRNA vaccines extremely quick develop, I'd expect see boosters better protection variants tested relatively short order. Unfortunately, helps countries Pfizer Moderna vaccines widespread use.) deaths absolutely dramatically undercounted, also remember India's largest spikes occurring right now. Deaths spikes lag 2 weeks, catching soon.

It'll take years get worthwhile estimates final death tolls India, easily multiple millions said done. someone got J&amp;J....shit! I'll sum couple coworkers reasons getting it.

Also interesting AZ generally worse first shot Pfizer opposite. 51% would get upvotes since lies downvoted hell here.   What? Ontario still lockdown nearly dodged hospital triage program, Alberta starting lockdown, Nova Scotia new restrictions last week, BC travel bans health regions. cause countries worse mean Canada well.

 I've medical colleagues worked, done rotations trained India, I've walked average hospital India pandemic pretty sight.. wanted patient pandemic.

The surprising part happening, took long happen. meant India well initially initial measures. think actually could kept longer beaten allowed political rallies religious gatherings happen. However India got complacent let guard due early success, held strong sufficient vaccines delivered (which might take another year so).

In seeing videos hearing stories what's going now, feel patients, families healthcare staff currently India dealing horrifying wave. Everyone negatively affected wave. 

Hoping India enact strict measures effectively help curb spread, vaccine distribution take long time. fear India beginning, fear come. increased manufacturing capacity lead fewer vaccines manufactured ? sounds like voodoo economics there. really based availability vaccines. everyone get one people refuse don’t think solution keep restrictions forever. same.

As likely know, pause use Janssen noting 6 cases rare blood clots low platelets nearly 8 million doses given. additional outreach investigation, total 15 cases reported J&amp;J, noted women 50 years old rare, higher risk others type clot (\~13/million).

Bottom line 3 protective, specifically women 50 weigh benefits convenience one dose (and full protection within 2 weeks) rare risk compared 2 dose regimens would take 2nd dose bit longer time get fully protected. - Dr. Pan Covid back January, lost taste smell sore throat really. :) *One simple trick doctors* *~~hate~~* *love* still requires COVID displaced several hundred thousand deaths causes.

Reddit: IQ bullshit means nothing

Reddit, goal Corona doomsaying: 7 IQ POINTS HUGE DROP That's great idea. Many places already charge smokers higher insurance rate making poor life choices. I'm 100% board people refuse vaccine past Emergency Use status FDA.  think would happen death numbers lessened viral spread lowered total cases?  U.S. government pay companies $1.95 billion upon receipt first 100 million doses, following FDA authorization approval. U.S. government also acquire additional 500 million doses.

Americans receive vaccine free consistent U.S. government’s commitment free access COVID-19 vaccines.

“We’ve committed making impossible possible working tirelessly develop produce record time safe effective vaccine help bring end global health crisis,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman CEO. “We made early decision begin clinical work large-scale manufacturing risk ensure product would available immediately clinical trials prove successful Emergency Use Authorization granted. honored part effort provide Americans access protection deadly virus.”

“Expanding Operation Warp Speed’s diverse portfolio adding vaccine Pfizer BioNTech increases odds safe, effective vaccine soon end year,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Depending success clinical trials, today’s agreement enable delivery approximately 100 million doses vaccine American people.” 

Stop spreading fake news. Given 40% State (Ohio) vaccinated, vaccinations slowed like 15K day, see ever hit herd immunity. never here. :( Every 50 years old able vaccinated may 10th.

Everybody may 12th, there's free slot day (IE : may 17th, checking 18, there's free slot, take elligible even 50 years old)  Lots BS surrounding story.

That’s many people die get sick took ten million people gave new vaccine instead, there’s real danger heart attacks, cancer diagnoses, deaths attributed vaccine. mean, reach large enough population, literally going cases someone gets vaccine drops dead next day (just would *didn’t* get vaccine). probably trade issue tourism one. long there's masks, I'm going stay inside much possible. people still wearing them, there's still risk there, right? 

I like inside better anyway. That's everyone outside US thinks. lockdowns first happened, schools daycares closed parents stuck lurch, working home trying take care kids simultaneously. vitriol flowed, ""Why kids want take care them?"" ""Schools daycares!""

Anyone one kids beginning certainly plan another. Parents busy trying survive social safety nets upended.  700 deaths day 250,000+ year, yeah excess deaths definitely high.  would set dangerous precedence.

Where would research scientists? fascinating. Thank posting.

Where would research scientists? aren’t threatened virus. also us gotten vaccinated frustrated, know feel betrayed still restrictions. ive talk vaxxed coworkers telling friends get vaccine restrictions still place. Thankfully Murphy keeps loosening them, helping.

but MA, coworkers would blasting facebook get vaccine, consider worthwhile. paying get vaccinated ? guys lucky. Hurts research industry needlessly, won’t help anyone. Yeah, poor people die. “All vaccines bad....except SputnikV. SputnikV perfect vaccine. Safe effective.” didn’t get vaccine, that’s fault.

This idea problem with. Statistically super unlikely point.

As April 26 9,245 breakthrough infections reported CDC, 6,720 symptomatic infections. Although numbers certainly higher now, really unlikely one people posting Reddit sub Saying something positive needs followed action really positive.  Saying something negative negative.  zero, didn’t get vaccine, that’s fault.

That sentiment cannot proceed. expired yesterday 😭  I'm 20 hours second shot, headache nausea, walk around, feel pretty weak. Feels like regular body cold moment. Make sure pee clear time you’re getting 2nd shot you’ll fine. Tylenol only, Advil.  Yeah clearly told egg split, twins much. immune response weaker doesn’t mean wasn’t enough. key detail. 

Look UK. Look data set provided Ontario infections post one-shot. data there. One dose protective known variants. feels like general sentiment street done. We've passed point need worry. Whether translate riskier behaviors infections knows.  sulfa allergy well, issue outside normal sore arm/aches type stuff. Good overcoming hesitancy!! Yep! Exact text. still reported still 24 hours later (along bunch similar crap her). 🤦‍♀️ reported profile, bypasses neighborhood leads goes directly NextDoor staff, finally banned - idea permanent. hope so. idiots encourage gullible idiots! realy want this. said, venn diagram people refuse get vaccinated/need basically chased bribed take people complain Biden giving away vaccines circle. What? studied probably studied long global supply shortage, partly ethical reasons. supply becomes abundant though might see work here. I'm finding hard see big negative comment. hypothetical manufacturers create vaccine expensive big manufacturers, would still likely economical win purchase vaccines.

And enough competition main manufacturers (who would almost certainly still outpacing new players production, lot) like prices would uncontrolled highs.

If issue prices high vaccine, could see argument. that's issue; never expensive vaccine. Supply simply cannot meet demand right now. That's it. makes sense considering high demand would something like this. manufacturers produce many vaccines fast possible, better. 

Price almost irrelevant point. action meant attack issue supply/production, price. act applying patent requires disclose certain amount trade secrets. That’s basically deal public inventor: “tell us thing works (thereby enhancing public knowledge) we’ll give monopoly making X years”. 

“Waiving” patent gives generic manufacturers legal right make vaccines without paying license fee. 

The problem vaccines there’s much engineering involved science. someone like Pfizer sets new plant involves flying experienced engineers set things up, still takes months get speed. 

Which probably explains there’s generic Moderna manufacturing despite promising enforce patents. 

Tom Chivers puts much better could. Waiving patents unlikely positive effects risks sorts negative ones: successful proof concept mrna vaccines, much easier get funding future research field compared pre-corona. also lot goodwill releasing patents think e.g. pfizer/biontech Moderna going lose lot business either. China India could produce vaccines cheaper rich countries would still buy EU/USA quality reasons. Vaccinated following CDC guidelines good job!  company (toyota) giving us $100 get vaccine. coworkers vaccinated plan going soon still nice gesture suppose. would hope so. thought already submitted “Cries Canadian” Mexico, literally everywhere go check temperature give hand sanitizer, stuff doesnt even work covid idk governments obsessed it. Likewise, US could open borders vaccinated people UK it’d much appreciated. haven’t seen American partner year now, despite fully vaccinated. covid vaccine side effects indication hard covid may hit got infected without vaccination? Wow, illegal. need arrest senators whatever call there.  one guy promised opposed guy tried someone else wished mean anything. need see *actually* ends done, otherwise entirely politics Thanks. concerned legitimacy site hosts article, rather content. token, would scoff anti-vax stuff Iranian site would hypocritical take one face value. changing manufactured. doesn’t change amount supposed receive. May side effects mild antibodies robust! [and next cite UK Israel - yeah, go look far *far* harsher lockdowns starting Dec 2020] Folding@Home saw tiktok this, Biden said absolutely asked question, last year. recently someone asked question again, said think :) 

I guess someone told first question :) Two issues that:

1. Vaccinated numbers overlap COVID infection #s hard say vaccinated also got COVID previously. can't add together.
2. immunity life-long point vulnerable get vaccinated (and vaccinated, keep additional shots every year whatever designated time frame)

I think immediate future, i.e. summer total vaccinated # bit lower ideal unvaccinated folks still immune COVID infection provide immunity. can't rely forever. guess masks things interest you, right.

If care part end millions people dying worldwide, that's another matter. think listen CDC. state officially get vaccinated. listen health authorities around world recommending vaccination even covid infection &amp; recovery. smarter people you, who've read done far research make important decisions (i'm saying they're always right, understand magnitude policy decisions recommend). 

we would different place right everyone, including states' govt's, would listen health authorities. current vaccines already effective single dose? 79.4% efficacy enough call vaccine ""one dose,"" vaccines considered ""one dose."" page CDC's website regarding breakthrough cases. Right now, says 132 people fully vaccinated died, 20 unrelated Covid. know partially vaccinated people. disingenuous?

We literally flying people helicopters hospitals hospitals overwhelmed. literally *cusp* **utilizing** triage protocols - reason *because* third wave kill nowhere near levels earlier waves

It killed lot people indirectly non-emergency surgeries still shutdown.

How hard grasp? many COVID-19 infections overwhelm hospitals, make quality care drop every single facet.

We're like one month away able safely re-open lot, amateur experts like revel epistemic trespassing keep thinking y'all geniuses. 
Correct I'm wrong boosters actually ""boost"" neutralising antibodies make sure neutralise emerging variants evade vaccine induced immunity least effectively bringing vaccine efficacy lower. 


Also think true trials severe disease death considered primary focus. trials even time rollout much concrete data whether vaccines actually stop passing virus, obviously know seems case indeed. 


With said think person replying correct saying preventing severe disease, hospitalizations deaths priority making, testing distributing vaccines Take example : 

 [Немец получил прививку Pfizer и стал суперраспространителем COVID-19. Научпоп - Россия 24 - 

Rossia 24 one local propaganda channel. particular news reportage guy became superspreader Pfizer vaccine. Exactly. live Boston area I'm spending almost every weekend Maine Rhode Island summer. neighboring states open late May, still can't go brewery without ordering shitty food. Fyi FDA approval waiting long term efficacy.

Safety studies done. I’m sure meant way I’m interpreting it, US made announcements opening borders Schengen countries UK right now. 

As stands, it’s one way deal vaccinated US citizens travel EU, sign US alter travel ban right now. almost bad could ask Indians many percentage friends family died multiply average Indian population. see headline, NY Times not. People lazy say BioNTech/Pfizer. could say ""P"" would. fundamentally different say ""This group people highly vulnerable care, stay inside want safe"" ""This group people unlikely severe reaction covid, still uncomfortable things opening back right problem"" Agreeeeed. August 22nd date Boston travesty. Hopefully timeline moves considering one leaders vaccinations.  decent source this? far, 200 million doses vaccines distributed inside European Union – 200 million. enough vaccines vaccinate half Europe's adult population least once. far, 200 million doses vaccines produced Europe shipped rest world. Europe exports much vaccines delivers citizens. Exports Europe go 90 countries, COVAX included. Shipments go close allies like Canada UK. dear British friends received total 28 million doses continent far. Even 72 million doses shipped Japan. also many millions friends Singapore, Mexico Columbia – name few. would like take issue notion deleoped without federal money. exact vaccine may devoid that, platform previous work SARS vaccines using technology funded NIH grants.

I think important people understand much ""we"" paid basic r&amp;d medicines. California, also possible Californians high-demand cities driving area get vaccinated. That's happened Texas anyway. I've seen people report improvement receiving vaccine. may hope improvement some. 

[Why Vaccines May Helping Long COVID News Yale scary thought India still lag phase death growing. Assuming correct counting double infection even grows exponentially. Fuck yo kids Similarly, I’d like state publish new hospitalizations. currently publish total hospitalizations every weekday along daily change, doesn’t inherently imply new. Like 5 fewer people hospital, mean 10 new people got admitted 15 left, example. 

I think it’s important new hospitalizations dwindling, think it’s important know couple hundred people hospitalized since vaccines came. Glad got one. walk local walmart county get vaccinated today, appointment necessary get vaccinated free.

The count county health dept 33.7 percent vaccinated May 5th.

Darwin going party around summer. 10) We'll still various restrictions bother? Wait till hear ones even first dose. Japan *just* started vaccinating 2% one dose 0.8% two dose

Feel bad people couldn’t anything days answer no, unable think long term. good thing FDA approves Pfizer shot 12 15 year olds, numbers going go again. will. 6 months full throttle vaccinations need assuming 70% population take it. can't think first-world country able achieve within year. **CDC: Path This**

US CDC stated expecting “sharp decline” cases July, vaccinations continue masking ... close [to woods.] feel like India ""testing enough"" country running dry testing resources. 413K cases 25% positive means around 1.6-1.7 million tests done day... metric ton tests. would absolutely like tax dollars going help American people rather military industrial complex. least I'm making shit like do. sub ridiculous auto ban bots. nothing shit posters like you. One following must true:

1.) CCP far, far competent government people China almost 100% compliant Public Health measures.

2.) They're lying numbers.

Knowing know totally corrupt Chinese government, seems likely? man want one saying two years Good luck that. whole orderal likely excuse get mRNA maybe viral vector tech free. way pharma industries profit develop, also get keep whatever money would’ve sent aboard developed nations Russia vaccines. pay get free perhaps even profit it.  don’t know everyone sub keeps saying that. Unless south, state still wearing masks social distancing 2022, maybe 2023. Nice  We've spent 4x annual military spending COVID relief already. far less budgetary issue lead believe. suppress it, almost entirely eliminated matter 2 months. numbers make absolutely zero sense. Take look consider 1.4 billion people live high-density situations. 20% caribou.  CDC stated today we’ll see vaccine case stop July. they’re optimistic too. guy trying post links banned misinformation right? hoping encompass phrase, ""if circumstances unvaccinated self would caught covid."" neglect subject household attack rate, ~16.6% figure applied overall, transmission adults ~28.3%, hypothetical great grandpa qualifies. B.1.1.7 seems upped R0 around 2 closer 3, probably increase attack rate, I'm avoiding guestimating numbers much data back yet, that, like peak viral loads vaccinated people, got skipped.

So go:
(Exposure assumed) 1 * .1(1-VE1) * .28 attack * .1(1-VE2) = .28% chance

...then we're still diverging couple orders magnitude, mostly we're starting different assumptions. visitor's exposed, random Washingtonian. Made German engineers. Nice, also largest percentile states.  Similarly Slovakian rejection Sputnik: shipments got seemed random manufacturing lots match manifest, etc. Russian manufacturing facilities seem lot QC problems. yet meet ""not getting vaccine/it's hox/microchip"" folks

Up northeast valley L.A. they're NextDoor. :( They've learned careful get banned, they're definitely there.

One lady day saying .8% people die within 2 weeks getting first shot everyone vaccinated dead 2 years. gone though. *blows smoke finger gun* money circulation per Good/Service sold leads inflation. simple supply demand. Say carrot Yes, virus evolve sufficiently mRNA vaccinations ineffective targeting it, that's nature viruses, that's make jump species species, reality many types coronavirus many different serotypes yet causes disease humans.

""However, effect SARS-CoV-2 vaccines cell responses common cold coronaviruses remain unknown""

This quote article enhances point virus family diverse, since common cold mutatable viruses around, concerned ability circumnavigate new forms vaccine, hence there's lot funding going retrofitting current vaccines combat future potential mutations.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, would cautious quoting scientific study sample size 30. I'm considered fully immune today. add data point, first dose Pfizer gave mild soreness arm, second dose gave bad fever headache almost 3 days.

Either way, I'm still planning wear mask indefinitely longer feels right to. according cdc guidance without distancing masks. strawman me. i'm concerned vaccine uptake. company wants works I’m fine too, problem vaccine policy. It’s common sense someone stubborn enough quit don’t want perfectly safe vaccine seems like problem. felt second. terrified bad would feel. wasn’t bad all. felt maybe slightly like hungover. husband sore arm felt tired. We’re 30s helps anyone. (Pfizer) problems, company perfect. what's basis assuming rest world can't produce vaccines? course can, covid first disease vaccine. countries already produce vaccines,

Besides, there's lot talk vaccines might effective safe others. entire world producing whichever vaccine considering best vaccine instead lab trying own? China could making Moderna. Israel saw dramatic fall pediatric cases adult population well vaccinated. US might able achieve Israel's 80% adult vaccination rate, unvaccinated child become much safer additional adult vaccination region.  Compared India, could say VN better general hygiene, people less religious better cohesion, government's control stronger (smaller population helps), case virus got spread, scale tragedy would nearly bad India right now, still surely tragedy nonetheless.

(The situation USA one VNese people accept let happen. Bad management, making disease political issue, endless disobeying preventive measures, Trump,... resulting nearly 600k deaths year, no, no. halfassed lockdown EU also proven bad far. enforced actual harsh lockdown better tracing quarantine, could VN since last summer, no, states dare enforce much violations personal freedom once, might lose votes, many people enough savings/support sustain even short harsh lockdown, thus semi lockdowns extended repeatedly, resulting economical problems losses, personal freedom still gets limited anyway.) carrot work well. Avoid stick. Yes, I’m talking HIV vaccines, strict IP controls around treatments suppressed disease let untold suffering spread. countries like South Africa took upon manufacture generic drugs violation controls start turn corner disease. basic, widely known public health think appropriate policy put place vaccines FDA approved. I'm vaccinated think everyone should, understand hesitancy bash ""wait see"" people.

Once they're FDA approved COVID still considered high risk public, *maybe.* back office anyway risk high. Yeah causes complain it. I’m saying lot different types people “don’t want get it”. people actively opposed people don’t care much. don’t think you’d cause much ill friction second group. Certainly enough counter productive towards getting many people vaccinated possible. That's circular logic. make mistakes, would show good are. make mistakes, difficult others. Fair point, although Corona. Coronavirus mutates slowly.

I wouldn’t put plane choice right now, especially American carrier there’s exceptions made (and we’re certainly traveling internationally time soon). couldn’t take stress wondering she’ll comply pressure’s on, there’s way force mask kid age. 

I think toddler wear mask several hours airplane exception, norm. It’s really unfair/unrealistic expectation, suspect that’s somewhat entire point - airlines government made way deter travel, hoping families decide bother take risk trying get young children comply strict rules. They’ll stay home drive year’s vacation.

You course know child best, maybe she’s tolerant mine, keep mind travel stressful stimulating little kids, even without added discomfort something attached faces hours. we’re flying time soon. It’s  vaccine incredible beginning; developed record time without subsidized US Government (although German Federal Government kicked money), highest efficacy rate them, none nonsense associated J&amp;J AstraZeneca. like Mercedes, German engineering. 1) bad outcomes COVID deaths. Even asymptomatic COVID damage. 

2) vaccines very, good. lot people overestimating good, misleading statistics it. 

For example, people wrongly used trials data say 100% effective death. misleading even PLACEBO groups trials zero deaths. tested mostly younger people. 

Or another example people using known breakthrough cases compared overall vaccines given. take account things like time delay getting COVID. Someone protected vaccine necessarily show breakthrough cases. 

Basically, vaccines help lot, there's still going small percentage (5%?) going really protected. low levels community spread still help adding another layer protection unlucky people.   pharmaceutical companies already made hundreds millions profit vaccines continue make hundreds millions despite lifting intellectual property protections. Anyone advocating policy advocating great number needless deaths.  ever dude. seems know everything.

Instead, need evidence.

So let's analyze evidence: Chinese government lying, there're two possibilities:

Theory One: pandemic still control China. Many many people still getting sick today situation much worse reported.

Theory Two: pandemic indeed controlled earlier (say, April 8, 2020, lockdown Wuhan lifted). However, actual numbers infected cases deaths waaaaaaay higher reported.

If Theory One true, we'll witness significant recession Chinese economy productions heavily damaged pandemic. Instead, everything good, including import/export figures reported countries. Products made China still keep running western markets. Thus, evidences theory.

For Theory Two, real curves infected cases deaths would totally different seeing right now. curves would skyrocketed high level dropped abruptly, make sense all. capacity usually based fire code, often obscenely higher number people *actually* tend restaurant given time.

The “not enforcing IP” moderna nothing marketing ploy.  patent original research done Katalin Karikó Drew Weissman UPenn. UPenn sold company holding patent Cellscript felt mRNA wasn’t going anywhere time, sometime 2005-2007. Surprisingly means key patent could expiring within next 5-7 years. Actually, quite illuminating.

Eliminate defense spending make rent free. obvious. could leaders failed see that? could possibly go wrong?

Reddit rule world. patently false. We’re looking poor counties vaccinated 2024. Big pharmas entire business model turned buying products biotech turning lawyerly innovations extend patents forever, block generics, product hop there’s competition. even flat collide generics stay market. I'm still amazed people get treatment (vaccine) mostly frees worrying getting severe illness. Ya, think start really publicizing infection death rates age vaccinated vs non vaccinated drive point home.... eventually pandemic pretty much remain spreading unvaccinated groups.... hopefully knowledge wears say, hey may well join vaccinated group.... gonna spread fast 20 something crowd get together parties 100 people... already suppose. variants get sick second time, sicker too.  makes sense. north east tristate hit real hard 60% first shots cases dropping like rocks. mean 40-60% drops cases daily. Rt NJ going 1 .4 week two. No, get that. wonder many people actually turned away due capacity limits. People complain restrictions, much effect restrictions left really having. got second dose! Fully vaxed babyyyy 🥳 Anyone saying lifting IP would help, nothing toting disproven lines lobbyists. $2B purchase order without product subsidy, different form. Palmer vs Western Australia shows court generally erred side caution movement ban relating pandemic.

However, WA blanket stop. could still apply exception. Palmer fill request properly (it pilot filled too) got titties twisted denied. Despite opportunity redo forms.

The test Biosecurity Act interesting relation supporting movement ban. Well get point one knows get covid, that's becomes india.
If covid control means good idea someone got it, especially everyone live city nowhere near suburbs I'm curious plays out.

I think every nation responsible helping get vaccine worldwide. prosperous nations, dealt populations, expected assist nations.
 
But, would certainly seem big reason vaccine now, unprecedented short timeframe, greed. 

greed big pharm companies.
 
unless going change system (which seems like really looking that) can't remove profit motive expect get companies invest right thing do.  know big corporations never right thing unless profit it.
 
I know take get vaccine everyone needs it,  need make happen -- also ensure next pandemic also valid plan vaccine development.  one greed available, need ensure greed still works, come alternate motivation actually puts humanity first, still works. people truely care / think long term credit score I’m bit confused Day 1. day COVID-19 symptoms started, date tested positive? started getting symptoms Monday sample tested positive Thursday, day would day 1 ? I've seen gyms restaurants block equipment seats limit total capacity. exactly said UK. acknowledged ideal world, splitting vaccination order job would ideal, noted administrative capacity really check this, age categories easier. Makes sound like vaccinations general work. headline mention began Chinese vaccinations high protection continued Sinopharm vaccines experts voiced ""very low confidence"" data provided drugmaker. think that's real headline. ""Crappy Vaccines Cause Covid Cases Surge."" began CTAP program last summer like advocating could’ve one hundred million extra vaccines now. Hard enough finance research, clinical trials, going regulatory process. eliminate protections people taking work commercialize someone else's product profit it, find far less research clinical trials would taking place. Profit efficient motivator innovation, would far less everyone undercut eachother. would watch it, japan pandemics get worse. adamantly ignorant usually welcome new information. Meeting opinion evidence winning strategy. Like antivaxxer value opinion higher reality.  approve vaccines time rich fled likely onto black market sitting warehouses course vaccine good idea. problem many younger people disagree scientific consensus here.  day, joyful memories snow days - celebrating cheering siblings radio announced snow day, sleeping bit later, sledding making snowmen kids neighborhood, hot cocoa after, gleefully schoolwork!

Naming/Cataloging virus variants complicated scientists trying come convention/standard name them. particular case using pango lineage convention. find info U get Pfizer? Maybe get job instead fucking parasites   plus one high altitude illness (HAPE) give hypoxia bilateral crackling lungs like especially shitty covid pneumonia, super different treatments mess if, let’s say, severely overwhelmed underfunded hospital treats incorrectly ass light-year unit distance time. #YESSSSSSSSSSSS!!! get vaccine cocktail one moderna one phizer? mean Pfizer needs minor tweaks Moderna needs more? Preeeeeetty much. I'm getting first shot 2 weeks (booked today) second shot September 10th. However, I've seen articles wait time likely shortened.

But I'm also really curious affects efficacy long run. remember Black Mirror episode... studied germany though would say alot german developed AZ clinically recommended 4 months first second shot. mean, I'm west coast major city working healthcare org already seeing decline demand so.... agree regional. Manufacturing huge part development lol concern open sourced this, third world might adapt treat illnesses? guess pharma companies needed exclusivity order recoup investment costs make bit money side. Yes, vaccines government funding, outside industry realise huge costs involved drug development production preparation, especially comes large-scale production.
Remember one thing - companies can't make money medical breakthroughs, we'd medical breakthroughs. Craig godsend Shantha went produce home-grown recombinant product, first-of-its-kind yeast system, $1 dose

Yes, took two decades. anti-example. proves opposite trying show. reason. mimic UK initially based second shot AstraZeneca vaccine recommended administered four months interval. REAL cases, I'm pretty sure already hundreds millions, depends much increase testing. Im sure seen news platform. Africa slowest vaccine rollout landlord's job parent. unironically  Meanwhile...

What’s source “2-3 million dead”? didn’t visit SF, limiting travel places except remote camping hiking. extremely anxious catching virus, outdoor activities per research I’d done transmission. vaccinated January, let anxiety go. Visited mother (also vaccinated) inside childhood home first time year: we’d meeting backyards. Also went botanical gardens SF girls, went dinner restaurant first time 14 months, downgraded N95 surgical mask seeing patients. believe vax works. heart breaks India, Cambodia areas hit hard virus, finally turning tide US. Everyone wants shot gotten one except kids, take 15 year old get Pfizer shot next week. you’ve vaccinated, it’s time relax now. feel like say, get vaccinated careful. Vaccinated folks, watch STD’s crazy parties. older Pfizer! stay ass home ? India’s chances dethroning US cases? Well, no. time mortgage forbearance stuff inflating bubble popping later. think concern isn’t deaths lessening viral spread lowering amount cases. pay attention variants too. Won’t happen. geniuses won’t wear mask also ones know better doctors scientists won’t take vaccine. read Reuters release see contract contingent BioNTech Pfizer producing working vaccine minimum efficacy required FDA. would money.

I trying understand issue this? first functional vaccine, effective vaccine, developed US paid US Government? so, get it, first moon. too. always say people avoid talking heads punditry Rising guilty pleasure.

Keep mind academic conferences exactly money spinners, quite cheaper hubs, vaccination rates low. massive profit people turning down, degree hassle concern attendance people rip cord. hosting institutions bigger fish fry right anyway, given losses institutions last year.

Meaning, jnj would protected went got Pfizer 2 dose regimen? safety concerns? lost ton potential memories go home school. I’m lot better thankfully rough Fall Winter season 2020, didn’t seem like end didn’t know do. Thankfully end Lord working  team Moderna. take offense saying Pfizer best.

;-) ""Pfizer BioNTech receive money government unless vaccine succeeds large clinical trials successfully manufactured, according Pfizer spokeswoman."" averaged thousands people. think good day. mom used work rental property management bit. people legitimately professional squatters pay 1 months rent ever tie eviction 6 months minimum landlord savvy eviction process So, saying mind waiting kids vaccinated? Okay. SUPER careful year+ betterment adults, but... Okay. That's works. visited San Francisco March 2021, wearing mask necessary, sorry. surprise motive isn’t grief condolences death respected doctor. 

Their vaccine helped Chile data I’ve seen. certain, scientifically, better. requires data collected studied. bunch people saying, ""Sure, go it!"". Sure has. lack cases identified tracing, last 13 months. Every single study completed identified cases outdoor transmission confirms it. We’ve year. tracing results confirm?   That’s I’m asking myself. Massachusetts long dragged feet reopening, strictest mask social distancing laws country. But, also nearly 60% state vaccinated least 1 shot. 

With TWO months till 4th July, towns pulling canceling reason why. outdoor venue middle summer can’t commence 60%+ state fully vaxed then. “covid warriors” tell fuck “free-dumb” whatever.  must consult high council (Academia). divine expected, and, hence, irony.

I know get attention Alanis Morisette. Well models models, don’t necessarily predict future. guess models looking states opening honestly since weather warmer, people outdoors, lot people vaccinated, think it’s still gonna trend down. 

Remember, models predicted “case explosions” March April didn’t really happen least looking country whole. back research indicated asymptomatic spread covid extremely rare, asymptomatic confused *presymptomatic*, presymptomatic spread exceedingly common.

Is still leading theory? Yeah, fair enough. 

I guess though friendly team ravenclaw vs hufflepuff kinda thing. Russia vs US kinda thing. time Oxford frontrunner, see worked out. Never got flew shot before, getting vaccine.

Not anti-vax never really got flu dont want flu shot, interest putting something body without long term data results.

Its easier label people dont think exactly like you. Im young healthy. get covid ill fine. Aslong people get vaccine want - anyone care get it. doesnt effect you. almost like OP u/Pessimist2020 something. True.

In sense infectious strain saviour lethal/potent variant.

That said, really know yet variants concern fall potency transmissibility chart. Im boat, first shot week next one end August, REALLY hope 2nd one gets pushed everybody responds differently, 36hrs hell pretty much good go Médecins Sans Frontières ""just glorified blog""? Oh dear, bless poor little heart. LOVE RISING! WOOT! We’re healthy, look sexy it. time BioNTech called Pfizer see wanted partner already 20 vaccine candidates developed. February. knew vaccine, US Government time announced Warpspeed, May 15th.

BioNTech light years ahead game - pun intended.  None you’re arguing true even makes sense. US secured first 100 million doses, early clinical trial data read made clear vaccine creating robust neutralizing antibodies. phase 1/2 clinical trials done almost done point. That’s US government tried purchase BioNTech, blocked founder German government. “put option” analogy makes zero sense, call option analogy would slightly make sense it’s really awful analogy begin with. would US government believe price would go lock contract, put analogy? strike price excise date? BioNTech Pfizer gave US government opportunity purchase vaccines guaranteed contract, didn’t take countries would happy enter contract. matt gaetz variant. concern easy go remote. hope use criteria previously used cancel school. 

Already year son’s school remote day (literally first week back four day classes) due potential bad weather didn’t even rain drop storms supposed roll couple hours school let out. questioned whether would cancelled make day later. might link conjecture without studies support it. glorified blog. bad news covidi- uh, vaccine-hesitant. Lol, I’m saying don’t get hyped vaccines - chill trying bolster brand vs brands need everyone get vaxxed whichever brand get ahold - well regards main goal: keeping people severe illness / hospitalization death; preventing community spread. Excited see low go weekend! That's problem beginning. 100%. got AZ like chump. living character? Every single drug approved FDA past decade public funding. really surprised Biden's 70% July 4th announcement. really model see gets us there. I've modeled data two ways Sunday see path get there. 

A displaced moving average (i.e. adjusting data lag bias bringing average) puts going forward moving average 700K starting today. Ignoring 16+ vs. 18+ moment, still need 46M doses get 70% 16+. There's 60 days July 4th. 700K day puts us 66 days. assumes today decline stops. 

I really want happen see pathway make happen. obsession strains misplaced; booster shots long-lasting immunity.

The phase 2 trial tested people vaccinated 6-8 months ago, measured antibody levels neutralizing titers. Booster shots gave increased neutralization ability original B.1.351 lineages. antibody measurements higher initial vaccination, 351 booster appears done substantially better across board. trials currently running include smaller dose multivalent booster. filled people think vaccines work

Yep That’s literally everyone asking you, can’t seem oblige us. Exactly. perspective, much propaganda. right supply diverted Belgian plant American ones. However, updates delivery speed. Moderna put ass first dose. 101° fever night after, aches, feeling hot cold, arm hurt like hell. even developed cough week still lingers bit. 

10/10 would get shot again. Next weekend second dose I’m excited. time Memorial Day.  Wait, mean opinions Chinese people Chinese government matter? Fantastic. rational person I've ever seen. lot people would get vaccine accessible require computer smartphone get appointment. pressing need mobile pop clinics rural remote areas. Also, local pharmacies accept walk-ins. sure would use Mercedes comparison. German cars notoriously unreliable. would call Pfizer Lexus vaccines didn’t read disclaimer. suggesting can’t since data hasn’t arrived yet.

“Data incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death.”  I’m patiently waiting go South Korea well:) learning language would love take concert delicious food asap:) I'm saying should, could get vaccinations own. 

Any place record first shot.

It sounds kinda bad, US, there's surplus. importantly, doses thawed morning use must thrown away used anyway. Same. us lucky guess. sister reaction 2nd dose felt fine thats non answer lol, say literally anything

Hang bhai. 
I situation last year got ok. im vaccinated, give shit worth got second shot today cvs usa person there. guy said normally 160 people day they're 45 less. thinks everybody wants one scheduled one people fence still coming first shot. america bout lot less demand. got first dose March 21. Second one scheduled July 13 :0 would’ve saved plane ticket US tho, still glad thankful got shot talking section 8 housing. award give, I'd give might want re-read comment, friend. Pfizer much mature company probably bit efficient trails well navigating regulatory processes. also global distribution, Moderna still mostly/only US. CDC weighed this, say “In exceptional situations mRNA vaccine product given first dose cannot determined longer available, available mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may administered minimum interval 28 days doses complete mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series.”

There lot paragraphs statement telling everyone realistically it’s probably fine, won’t ever studied recommended. See section “Interchangeability COVID-19 vaccine products” What’s like massive needle jammed arm? 😜 (It’s good fun lol, don’t hate.) get june july rate..

If think months reasonable, sure tell you. Citifield (home Mets) currently open nearly 24/7 vaccinate people Pfizer vaccine. Switching J&amp;J fans allowed stadiums makes sense. bullshit spewed thinking it’s anyway type partisan political motive say 2 doses Pfizer Moderna vaccines needed full protection, mention protection variants.

If bullshit 2nd dose didn’t matter, Public Health Canada would allow Canadians 1st dose freedoms CDC given fully vaccinated Americans would actually give re-opening timeline.

The reason haven’t done shipments still unstable big dog shipping vaccines consistently Canada throughout pandemic Pfizer. They’re unsure actually get everyone fully vaccinated throw September target.

It start change coming months definitely botched till now. weren’t Biden lifting Pfizer export ban, Canada would still getting 1m doses per week. 

Science data equal “only metric try convince people Canada badly” 

It’s truth. 

Yes fucking shit 35% people 1st dose great! don’t expect Canadian government start lifting restrictions there’s actually millions people fully vaccinated.

Or would already done lifted restrictions. haven’t. Why? Dr. Theresea Tam knows full vaccination needed prevent 4th wave variants.

Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine great efficacy 89.5% vs B117 variant &amp; 75% vs B1351 South Africa variant infection—but 2 doses. 1 dose efficacy ~29% vs B117 &amp; ~17% vs make sure go wonder Justin Trudeau always say “we listen science data experts” say nothing easing restrictions. It’s experts know Canadians never protected much countries high vaccination rates fully vaccinated.

And guess what? Canadians wait 4 months 2nd dose. can’t fully vaccinated follow 21-28 day spacing doses science suggested.

Why?

I’ll let connect dots figure guys paid country vaccines still getting late delays cuts, wait 4 months 2nd dose. rhymes botched vaccine rollout. must unlucky then. family members reported minor discomfort worst. meanwhile fairly high fever day, headache, rash injection. rash mild really existed day(2 days later), nobody else family seems seeing effects. border closed non-essential travel year now, correct?

It work way.

I'm sensing trend months avoidable cases, deaths, lockdowns, betting different vaccines receiving literally months later, finally starting work bit wherein high % percentage 1st doses 2nd doses matter. 

If 1st dose enough, Public Health Canada would say lift individual restrictions placed Canadians lives they're fully vaccinated, CDC done fully vaccinated Americans here.

But Public Health Canada, Justin Trudeau, Patty Hajdu, Dr. Tam know Liberal Party screwed vaccine acquirement late, later Israel already herd immunity correct vaccine rollout. Canada chance get much Pfizer fast, waited long.

Only things begin change 1.26m Canadians gotten Covid-19, knows many long term damage now, 24k lives lost countless non-sensible lockdowns.

Even Justin Trudeau Dr. Howard Njoo publicly admitted last week international travel borders account less 1% Canada's cases community spread workplace spread highest contributor.

Canada's bet Novavax even begin bear fruits mid 2022... bit late USA, EU, UK already opening everything. Moderna shipments unstable best unknown delivery schedule delays. little amount 300k J&amp;J delivered put pause even though FDA cleared again.

At least Biden lifted Pfizer export ban, maybe Justin Trudeau actually make deal time, guys get vaccines! There’s fine line public trust though, too. feel like it’s done might cause *more* distrust them.

It’ll get lazy people sure hesitant might hesitant force people 249.6 million=0.2496 billion

Anyone getting cards menace public health, real jerk. vaccines approved use India. Nothing stopping people going getting first shot, going back second. Unfortunately, seems majority people opting completely free readily available vaccine misguided fear unquantifiable if. never allowed countries put orders vaccines US production plants. 

Source proof explicitly shows country earth ordered doses owned private companies meant produced US private companies US blocked countries ordering private companies within US (before country potentially bought vaccines possibly produced US)? doses still paid reserved US. 

Also source proof doses owned produced private companies US owned bought US government. Saying something like ordered 600 million vaccines delivered 600 million vaccines yet, thus bought valid. must explicitly state US government paid reserved first x amount vaccine doses produced private production locations within US delivered US first (and only).

The risk death way higher someone getting Covid vs vaccine. 

With UK covid rates low, small proportion 29 year olds would expected catch vaccine risky. 

Essentially comparing low probability (bad effects Covid) multiplied low probability (getting Covid UK right now) low probability (bad effects vaccine) multiplied one.

If 29 year old India, vaccine would definitely safer option. europe, US probably would (although US could get Pfizer)  Well can’t argue Even proportionally less, still individual human beings suffering dying.

Yeah big cut adults) population stays unvaccinated everything open, local hospitals busy treat conditions/emergencies covid spike hits. Confirmed cases US 10% population. need much get people vaccinated, can’t let it’ll affect us. Good point, devil details. Sometimes industry collaborates production techniques, figured something others haven't, would share? think we're yet. get vaccinated, I'm didn’t get vaccine, that’s fault.

That's bad argument. got relationship right pandemic hit immediately got BC even though weren’t even sex point. way hell baby pandemic, absolutely lol. think problem people Covid get vaccinated well way knowing group in. ever reasons, people making decisions personally affected them. It’s ruling class rest. bad argument. cost restrictions. risk low enough, costs weigh benefits. Many children die car accidents. ban cars considered acceptable loss due benefit cars provide. Given abysmal outlook since initial uptick, that's pretty low bar. 

But... yay? Idunno, think actually might be.  still matters facts. 

Sure, going catch 100 yards away, 6 ft nowhere near adequate aerosol instantly travel across room. 

You'd surprised. shitty ventilation system recirculates inside air filtration spread typical restaurant sized room quickly. death thing worry children? already neighbor Excel spreadsheets save lives! News 11. NY Times piece this, experts ground saying undercount range 2x ***6x*** reported deaths, absolutely insane. low end range already record setting, crazy little attention seems getting. 

Feels like thing keeping what’s happening top headline every serious news website right now. Seems like one week acknowledgment week two ago calls aid disappeared despite fact everything gotten much worse since then. Good thing could get it. deaths children flu 17/18 season. 45 million total cases total population. deaths children covid. million cases covid entire population. would make things much easier deal with. Right. Covid never major health issue kids. adults wanted vaccine gotten it, reason everything shouldn’t fully open within U.S. except keeping borders closed unvaccinated people &amp; highly infected countries (Brazil, India, etc). risks actually significantly lower, shouldn't.

It's still bad argument make. ""Kids less risk can't currently get vaccinated fuck em"" hold water. sounds like get upper respiratory infection every 3 years, influenza. general, flu worse common cold, symptonms intense. people influenza hiking going bike rides. influenza, typical muscle aching, fatigue, chills, bad enough even young healthy people find big effort go bed bathroom symptoms. take CBD day vaccine? 

I sometimes tendency panic around needles, often like take 15mg cbd form gummies help anxiety. Thanks. can't countries. Maybe export space? unsafe. Also unfair many countries bad outbreaks prevent focusing large event. wearing mask inside public place ok. Fucking weirdos. BS surrounding story.

There's lots BS around many stories. One Indian co-workers told us day ""this new strain Covid India deadly people collapsing literally hours getting infected"". Lol, no. know people kids don’t get either. part last year made want produce life... Haha least things within realms responsibility 👌 I’m inclined agree watching SCMP news report recent domestic tourist boom May Day, train stations absolutely packed gills right. don’t think that’s possible millions infections happening, something hide, foreigners there. get want this, incentive Pfizer make variant boosters make future vaccines government going steal them?

I know many say responsibility, that's built best vaccine far. Money built it, government needs careful turn Pfizer helping future. effective vaccines coronavirus' common cold? Hell yah dude , I’m glad hear you’re enjoying life 🤟. Crazy simple things like watching movie theater taken granted lol . definitely want start domestically traveling too. want visit Utah 🙂 Tell don’t child without telling don’t child shift available second shots needs happen. Locally, order available is: first shot possibility schedule follow second shot, follow second shot, second shot people able schedule first shot.

Many initial first shots given blank stare, shrugged shoulders asking (if!) would able get second shot.

First shot drive Moderna. Another organization second shot drive Pfizer.

Workplaces desperate get people back, provide vouchers first shot...can’t bothered second shot gets pissy workers needing time travel/stand line second shot drives. following large phase 3 trial participants 2 years know start getting covid. one keeps kids inside flu season. 

So risk less normal year, behaviors cautious normal year? that’s separation powers feds states! 

I suppose could changed constitution onset, process quite extensive! first laughed crazy thought maybe could legitimate strategy sway conspiracy-minded covid deniers maybe covid taken seriously. Fight fire fire, suppose. Staffing big issue here. example, pretty much every restaurant trying hire back front house. Distance still matters facts. Aerosols instantly travel across room. Time ventilation certainly matter away inside dramatically increases time lack ventilation needed high risk. Thanks dude , I’ve officially passed 2-week mark week , I’m definitely going start planning trips 🙏 Baby boomer came war. anything, baby boom would come post pandemic guess depends whether live small town FL not. That's argument favor capacity limits rather trying indirectly accomplish thing social distancing. never admitted here. press articles finally came criticizing Duterte's absurd covid policy, guts blame 1- locking long enough (at point measures relaxed country literally asfixiated) 2- bad enforcement it.

For example, here, overzealous policemen decided go beyond law decide things essential enough. never lockdown went far. reluctantly admit things, hospital capacity, also matter.  like nitpicking, I'd rather write 30,6% vaccinated one dose, statement (at least me) implies doses 😅.

I also think bad weather helped lower case numbers, least anecdotal ""evidence"". city (and around country friends mine living) people really mood meet quick grill evening, probably helping keep lockdown.

Otherwise i'm positively surprised relatively low count new infections, celebrated first may, known holiday celebrate get drunk friends. honestly expected large surge new cases week, restrictions seem keep people distanced. Things open (if) demand increases. Places going extend hours staff limited demand. People gotten comfortable watching movies couch ordering things online, changes may stay.

For NJ, I'd say still getting social part pandemic. know lot people still hesitant go out. expect hours stretch time, surprised ended short changing consumer habits. think covid deniers would actually start wearing masks avoid vaccinated? latest evidence indicates aerosol rather droplet spread. case, 6 feet apart irrelevant. Exposure time ventilation far important indoors. Incorrect, reduces density indoors meaning less people get infected. Four Seasons Pharmacy Princeton WV. Someone book flight. There’s going backlash people find instead own, it’s going make bank billionaires shareholders developing countries take advantage IP waivers make billions. Look SII already accused price gouging India got license Az/Oxford thru normal way. Bring poutine vaccine! currently 112th country world deaths per inhabitant. Even account severe undercounting, really seem like country managed pandemic particularly bad. Okay let's start fact Justin Trudeau government paid double countries got vaccines (still getting) months later is... botched rollout acquirement. 

What countries Canada pay double get vax after?

Considering countries higher per capita distribution approved vaccines US UK Israel, paid more, sound like flat Trudeau pursue Canadian domestic vaccine production 

How know India interested? Plus, classical alt-right talking point - novavax? Medicago? Oh right - domestic vaccine Rempel

Oh man, ain't regurgitating alt-right talking points G20

Now flat lying: away troll.  new Indian strain?

It's considered variant concern Friend, I'm drug developer that, like most, trained universities. lead led many company- academic collaborations. common situation specific mouse models biology knowledge help. cases that, would funded company SRA (sponsored research agreement). one saying academic labs arent grounds discovery ideas. huge gulf discovery application humans drug approval. narrative biopharma whole takes academics profits misinformed. Pfizer gang rise up! Thanks Merkel. wouldnt create one MRNA vaccine would steal property european firms gift american pharma industry. US would world favor ending stupid export bans. Germany one. UK, Switzerland, Australia name BioNTech Pfizer revenue profit. BioNTech Moderna primarily kept afloat early years private investment.  that's point, many variants happen threat... Hi Dr. Pan! name Natalie I’m actually connection LinkedIn! excited see reddit. awesome work! Personally, I’ve worked covid case investigator well covid-19 vaccine POD site support assistant. Starting fall, I’ll starting MPH program focusing Epi. question you: advice public health lovers keep getting related work? I’ve taught, prevention key would love continue journey helping others. Thank time hard work! good sources, also like NPR, BBC Guardian. Summer games 2022. Oh Beijing's year? Somehow feeling like lot sympathy. No, attempt humor. right!

It’s actually scientist tik tok LOL... know, usual source news, came across seemed make sense explain things calm way. tik tok @dr.noc may Instagram really doubt US estimate total deaths 900k none excess deaths figures we've seen high, usually 600-700k range.

That said, one accusation think thrown Brazil deaths covid systematically underreported, relative countries. arguably detriment near-term perceived toxic wasteland one allowed leave from, rest Latin America similarly struggled contain virus get bad rep absolute numbers big Brazil.

Shoutout Mexico particular study estimated slightly deaths Brazil despite population bit half Brazil's, yet generally considered ""ok"" far travel restrictions go. like subscribed something start offering new members deal way better got. something goes sale right buy it. difference can't cancel membership boycott pissed off.  European number format Lots fancy statistical tools work here. guess I'll go back school make distinguishable magic. Thanx, sharing feel like chance. take care (now) pretty good health COPD misspent youth included smoking lot unfiltered camel cigarettes! 1 last 13 years thankful Cancer missed far. lungs got Covid hope. hopefully get shots get past dam thing. Same. Pfizer. Sore arm 24-36 hours slight fatigue day second shot it. nearly summer. study probably wrong. way 100,000 deaths excess mortality overwhelmed hospitals. Feel sorry guy got 0.014 dose. offer every employer 4 hours pay tax write-off per employee gets vaccinated.... Seems lot easier. got paid day 15,000 points buy merchandise.  Well hollow one. answer “possible, rare.” becomes even rare people vaccinated, virus would need overcome odds every time tried spread, odds vaccinated person would even exposed much lower. There's evidence worse side effects getting vaccine sooner. entirely anecdotal far I'm aware. agree, think necessary quickly either. friends though trust immune response weak symptoms want vaccine. guess anxious, might well. vaccines lmao 
My country like
Old people first = Old people dont show vaccines thrown away 
Everyone else: get vaccines else throw away
Goverment: REEE old people first  Please belittle patronize one incorrect. 

In case absolutely idea, new you, program developed last year set facilities manufacture vaccines came efficacious. Moderna Pfizer refused this. yes, Moderna pfizer contracted several companies locations around world manufacture vaccines. sorry loss brother. top that, also ""you could fucking die running treadmill myocarditis via covid"" thing data continues evolve showing excellent effectiveness getting mRNA vaccines, especially protection hospitalization death 94% higher. vaccine 100% effective much higher effectiveness many vaccines, million people vaccinated course seeing people vaccinated test positive. 

In CDC CA data far, &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;1% persons vaccinated tested positive, much much smaller # hospitalized died. Even amongst those, information whether hospitalized died COVID-19 causes tested positive. - Dr. Pan lol studies done effects COVID vaccine women? Based other’s experiences, issues hot flashes, night sweats, strong menstrual cycles, etc. Thank much everything way! what? Chinese vaccine better vaccine, Russian vaccine already one best there. takes place minutes vaccination. Maybe mandatory testing work week. case would make sense. Thanks. found it. bad I'm scared hospital bills hospital stays? Highly doubt it. won’t even get glass vials vaccines manufactured quality required two German companies world. syringes, incubators,… supply chain extremely long limited manufacturing capacity know how. vaccine part problem. Even know make vaccines mean can. whole thing infuriating. “kind of” understand mistakes maybe thinking beaten earlier yesterday India’s 7 day average reported cases hit new world record 385k beating previous world record held India day prior. 

The fact government still continuing act like everything okay people die thousands horrific. Right pulling every stop possible prop healthcare system, increase vaccinations stop spread they’re prideful that. interesting, though, see insignificant number people said they’d *less* likely get vaccine offered money it. Apparently that’s previously known phenomenon, means strategy could potentially backfire. wonder what’s that? I'm glad hear made feel better!

I agree, really easy lose mind stuff, especially everyone throwing conflicting information you. me, really got better started making effort focus scientists doctors say, opposed news outlets etc. lot stuff see online social media bunch ckickbait. really important listen people know they're talking about, also make feel overly anxious.

May ask, scientist following? Vaccine passports. Now. Require vaccination activity X people gather: flights, concerts, sports, conferences, casinos, larger restaurants/banquets, etc.

Anti-vaxxers sit home vaccinated friends live up. Fear missing powerful motivator. It’s got nothing religion. It’s people’s actions responsible. Many Muslim religious authorities (Idk religious authorities different religions say) issued warnings people congregate large numbers pandemic. people don’t follow that’s them.

Also, something worth noting:
 Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""If hear outbreak plague land, enter it; plague breaks place it, leave place."" (al-Bukhari 5728) 

So idea religion ignorant plagues work true, insinuating. agree though people messing right. Hope able shed light. Thanks! shoulda checked first, haha. know. hope everyone knows. experience symptoms (more less) mild form ""visible"" proof. Hello, Dr. Pan. sake argument, let’s say someone strong immune system therefore believes manage ride epidemic without getting vaccinated. Assume more-or-less decent sort person completely selfish possess degree concern “my neighbor”, community society-at-large. would say convince taking vaccine fact, albeit unintentionally, along anti-vaxxers, causing epidemic go longer necessary?
Thanks advance? (I hope.) still much less previously agreed deliveries, deliver Q1+Q2 expected Q1 That's way it. fully expect health insurance U.S. make Covid pre-existing condition. willfully unvaccinated need pay price stupidity. kind hard believe. 

On hand, seems pretty unlikely Florida middle pack death rate despite highest percentage 65+ people US, I’m sure there’s least little bit miscalculations occurred. wonder work practice - parents detailed processes, equipment, precursor materials. everything patent know made available? least, less full disclosure full process details conditions ictions might well delay producers. people bad side effects first shot, second one tends knock people day shot. even like half people get bad side effects. second shot awful chills fever like 1 half hours middle night moderate headache entire next day that's all. think concerned monitoring variants evolution carefully. Current data suggest existing COVID-19 vaccines offers protection known variants. 


Manufacturers scientists continuing monitor study this. also important note vaccine protects prior infection future infection, including variants. - Dr. Pan So, update! 

It’s 24 hours since I’ve first shot didn’t side effects (aside arm little sore, sore point didn’t even think times). side effects biggest worry getting shot, especially since I’ve already Covid. Glad it’s going well far! think opening timelines released Northeast CA past week open mid June? reasonable? honestly ask Boston resident business owner given 8/22 opening date 3 months behind similar cities. two questions:

1) opinion current research far fully vaccinated individual capable spreading covid? would imagine *can* spread covid, likely think is?

2) opinion recent data released indicating prior covid infection provides protection 95% efficacy rate? believe aid herd immunity even US bumps vaccine demand wall? I've provided link medically.  trouble figuring many people area likely form protection/immunity.  can't sum together recovered-from-infection + vaccinated, there's level overlap. Thats lymph nodes for! body mounting immune response swollen lymph nodes means body fighting (what thinks is) infection. right level really confirming behavior appropriate, next time they'll thing. Actions need meaningful consequences paying take vaccine, positively reinforcing behavior unwanted society. iteration dominant narrative presented media outlets benefit large sums ad money [addiction-peddling pharmaceutical companies seems erasing infection-induced immunity discussion herd/population immunity. even though happening now, India also still ranks 100s cases per million deaths per million. Whereas US top 10 cases per million top 20 deaths per million. think strong possibility, think vaccine manufacturers actively looking studying need this. often may need vaccine boosters still investigation, stay tuned great question! - Dr. Pan Pfizer 3.5 billion revenue single quarter vaccine. ...

But think comment brings light much hundreds millions government decades kept afloat. companies subsidized received government investment long time pandemic hit. Heck, would get shot second time $100. 1) contracts work, place best effort order someone else places best effort order expect operate conjunction. 

2) really matter, I'm saying AZ could chosen deliver UK without issue, I'm saying aware contracts would breached chose concentrate performing UK EU. real issue way AZ gave supply estimates, clearly overestimating everyone leading inevitable situation AZ failing meet demand. Aside strictly legal perspective there's moral question well. overpromised vaccines global pandemic inevitably going underdeliver, allocate underdelivery? think obvious answer everyone gets proportion promised doses (E.g. 20% promised Q1 doses everyone 

3) EU/Germany invested Pfizer, finished Pfizer order EU supplying UK?

4) even mean? UK population matter? EU producing far vaccines **per capita** UK that's dumb argument doesn’t make sense me. 100% vaccination covid would basically go away within relatively short period time. Part reason may go away timeline can’t get 100%, could, vaccines good enough could expect done covid. spreading everyone vaccinated? Motivating hide keep going work... terrible idea. 1-1 consultation scheduled week advance serves give exact information could've simply broadcast everyone once? That's going us; apologise I'd given impression meeting would involve anything warrant done individually.

Add long list screwups Japan's covid response. Hello! Thank AMA! 
1 question: know long term side effects?  


I'm antivaxer course, wanna sure ! Vaccines children. plan getting three children vaccinated (13,10,5 - mom dad already vaccinated) it’s turn. asthmatic child last year stressful. believe recent studies done proper dosage younger ages. terms safety, give us idea determine long term safety side effects small children? know enough types vaccines (mRNA) know safe kids short long term? Thank you! ""How likely would get vaccine available meant longer wear mask?""

Was stopping certain people wearing mask anyways? think people get vaccine conditions went entire pandemic without wearing mask anyways, whatsyerpoint? vaccinated would get vaccine regardless. offered $100 incentive retroactively would take it. company offering $500 bonus anyone gets vaccinated end August one person win $10k random drawing. may selfish, I'm telling anti vax coworkers hold strong. want ruining chances $10k. incentive dying Covid enough get shots. sad others need that.    basically guarantees be. incentive need Inactivated vaccine I’m Europe willing pay 100$ get vaccinated did, half Americans wouldn’t take it. Cruises weird. Cheap cruises like carnival suck; crowded hardly anything. destinations complete tourist traps, leave area get something authentic.

I also recommend ditching kids. Brought 5 year old one last year fun. Why? impression people want restrictions?

They don't. evil assholes politicized everything pandemic beginning still refuse things necessary end it.

Let's say Governor X announced tomorrow ""Nobody vaccinated wear mask!"" think anti-vaxx people would do? THAT'S can't nice things. incentives still wear double mask even full vaccinated.

t. CDC thoughts situation unfolding India impact herd immunity?  safe unvaccinated young children summer? news. Reporting scientific subjects routinely terrible. I'm thankful received education allows understand scientific studies, articles written often draw right conclusions. go straight source lot time. got second Pfizer shot two days ago. Glad finally fully vaccinated, side effects second shot brutal. gave nasty illness, like mild flu, probably physically sickest I've two three years. I'm physically healthy 23 year old man btw.

I'm hearing we'll need booster shots ever year COVID foreseeable future. boosters likely side effects bad initial set shots? really look forward putting every year. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Carrot stick. Yeah, I'm 30 fit, fuck around ""maybe long term brain fog lose sense smell"".  Wait second. doubt vaccines, entirely subsidized funded government decades, exist? 

Quite wild claim friend. 

You know bet nationalized research center never discover anything Large Hadron Collider. Hell, they'll probably never even build it. ... company giving $100 plus 8 hours PTO. Also, decided insurance premiums ""smoker"" level people refuse get vaccinated barring medical reason. Pretty solid incentive. noticed ticking days well getting worried, it’s weird cases starting finally show dramatic drop again. think it’s back downward slope. Got second dose two days ago, noticed lymph node armpit swollen. Freaky! (but apparently normal) PTO get shot nice, wish companies would also give paid sick days case don’t feel good enough come next day. Wildly impressive, gives hope June, supply even higher. There's literally zero evidence even suggest ADE going risk COVID-19. way know this: vaccinated people previously infected people getting severe COVID-19 en masse. fact, that's entire point vaccine -- protect COVID-19, exacerbate it, studies vaccine confirm this! ADE really concern front end vaccine development, billion doses administered already.

Hope helps! Yep, coworker said today virus over, anyone still wearing masks losers. Irony finest reality one biggest losers life I’ve ever gross misfortune meeting. could also incentivize getting many shots. Since US really get herd immunity anytime soon, think happen slow decline throughout summer. Especially deaths, lag cases month. expect suddenly drop zero within weeks. I’ll get 10 times pay debt!   That’s like, what, half one game now? I'm J&amp;J work pretty shitty company doesn’t give raises makes everyone work mandatory ot, still give us $100/year get biometrics done. Well idea start society changing awful hurry. reason concept exempt. Q: “why ________” 

A: “$$$” “It’s fair people got already!”

Don’t care, want many people vaccinated possible.

“This creates perverse incentive!”

Don’t care, want many people vaccinated possible.

“This criticized handout!”

Don’t care, want many people vaccinated possible.

“Somebody’s gonna pay this!”

Don’t care, want many people vaccinated possible. 

“This lead people demanding get paid future get vaccinated!”

Don’t care, want many people vaccinated possible. everybody, lot. US 100 million+ people _really_ wanted vaccinated, bunch people meh it. find groups everywhere. Thank you! This. never compare clinical trials unless done parameters, example, Sinovac included health workers working directly covid infected patients also extremely mild symptoms, Pfizer included normal people count extremely mild symptoms, can't compare two. biggest measure mitigate transmission vaccination, vaccinated population high percentage amount people get seriously sick less. reason mitigation efforts slow spread overwhelm health care system, people get adequate care develop serious case. Boy, reality goes away, libertarians come play. 

Too many people seem forget actually government issues patents. government take away. reason even patents first place incentivize benefits, public. single corporate entity. public grant order benefit public. intent innovation. pendulum continuously swinging far, however.

Not mention, current patent system end all. Arguably, competitive innovation driving methods past. God humanity far gone. use carrot stick people get could lifesaving vaccine definitely life saving vaccine others.

I saw somewhere thought unnecessary would US vastly unreported COVID deaths Brazil? Got first dose Phizer yesterday arm fairly sore went bed, woke already feels almost entirely better besides really light feeling soreness injected. Hope second shot easy haha.

Also convinced friend last night anti-vax thought kinda pointless get vaccine right away putting sign his. Glad part haha Really wish people would stop shitting vaccines Moderna/Pfizer every country access many options choose from, every post see regarding Astra-Zeneca, Coronavac (Sinovac's vaccine) Jonsson Jonsson people talking shit them, yes, I'm aware Reddit's racism towards China case feel like everyone happy people getting vaccinated regardless origin vaccine, example, parents got Coronavac, tested positive antibodies, studies show works effective Moderna Pfizer effective preventing death hospitalizations that's matter no, I've told useless, parents still danger get doses different vaccine (when even recomended yet 6 months-a year booster shot), can't even compare clinical trials done using completely different parameters Astra-Zeneca's case, know differerent type blood clot ones birth control cause people act like 100% get one get vaccine.

While chance get Moderna, I'm still happy parents fully vaccinated, even vaccine lower effectiveness preventing symptomatic infection, care dying/being hospitalized far good. There's actually recent evidence rhinovirus (common cold) infection may provide protection Awesome! Fully vaccinated. 👍👍 KK upstate NY. Give free ticket India ""Community Service"". Definitely. economic terms makes sense anyway, getting vaccine, people part provide ‘public good’ (herd immunity). would like ‘carbon rebate’ provided carbon sink. BionTech hold onto patents regarding RNA, regarding corona vaccines, RNA still. cant even bothered count many, want, heres list: Honestly, simple solution. 4th stimulus check, give proof full vaccination. partially vaccinated, get half stimulus, half able collected upon second dose. getting someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger promotional messages good.

I'm Ireland, seen many people foreign descent answer Irish someone asks from. inevitably followed question ""yeah, really from?"" completely ignorant insulting people consider Irish born in, grew anyone else.

Really person. 

Also main point would probably identify Turkish Germans something sort, since hold dual citizenship thus probably consider both. call African American African person. vein also call, Uger Sahin wife purely Turkish immigrants, especially wife born Germany  study found AZ almost effective too, reassuring got AZ compromise (either wait maybe June get age-based cohort Pfizer/Moderna get AZ now). 

When choice, took AZ. odds getting Coronavirus two months could get AZ Pfizer age-based-cohort sufficiently high (i work home, I'm guy touching peoples computers time) felt, given overall fatness hypertension, get vaccinated rather risk it.

I feel ton better since getting vaccinated, even 100% complete coverage, even got it, i've decreased odds hospitalization death 90+%.

My cousin lucky. got coronavirus three days getting AZ vaccine (almost certainly beforehand) like me, large couch potato, hospital oxygen (though 10 years older me). thoughts her. 

I imagine getting vaccine already nursing nascent infection like throwing gasoline fire innate immune response. really puzzles sort calculation part messaging around vaccinations. could encourage people get vaccinated, would help put vaccinated people's minds ease. Got second shot moderna yesterday I'm grateful feel sick either time lol Lol even ballpark. second dose get hungover + bad side effects.... gonna bad time. 

&amp;#x200B;

But fine. yay You’re falling media narratives try shift blame actually caused spread (lack social financial supports people stay home unwillingness oppose business interests actual lockdowns) sensationalist examples bad behavior. people dumb shit get sick? Yes, course. people got sick, course not. people got sick employers don’t give fuck workers, see many labor shortages service industry jobs like. maybe one story workers mistreated every 10 COVID parties.

The point make see determined people’s good bad behavior, reality it’s determined structural, economic, political circumstances prevented effective response US. way get focus upstanding pandemic citizen compared bad people there, challenge people structures actually responsible making things bad.

What ridiculous thought. many vaccine candidates funded via public money.
A lot research funded government grants. Global health important bottom line greedy pharmaceutical companies. what's estimate population unable get vaccine health reasons (not counting young children yet approved for)? 


I'm honestly wondering much even care anti vaxxers point. let COVID turn idiot disease kills people wear masks get vaccine. masses killed lockdown last time saved one Cruise Ship fly's US flag subject US law. petition governments Panama, Bahamas, nice Flag countries force admit unvaccinated individuals.

So say ""Sorry Florida, Country boat registered thus sovereign land sea, requires carry vaccinated individuals."" seems clear true, there's valid reason feeling way.

Case rate going down. Death rate kinda flat lining around ~700. Dude asked explanation complained someone gave one 'no stimulus checks unless vaccinated'. trick.

Wrong. initial studies focused reducing eliminating serious illness death. efficacy rate based infection rates, misleading since studies focused on. happens shift vaccine clinics central sites targetted areas. Events, malls, schools, etc. Go downtown set clinics largest office buildings people walk get it.

But also important remember 12+ eligible too, that's fair bump coming soon well don’t even care anymore. part, stayed home year, wore masks everywhere, didn’t see friends family.

I’m fully vaxxed now, I’m done. live anyone get vaccine time now. someone wants die Covid cause refused get shot, guest. bad.  Yes, unverified reports definitely quality “research”. know “think yourself” doesn’t mean “think opposite everyone else does,” right? Need implement tax credits vaccinated something. still assholes refuse though. understand helps. Oxford vaccine relatively easily manufacture, patents problems, effective one manufacturing relevant numbers outside Europe/US India. India already vaccine superpower.

Pfizer-Biontech vaccine even complicated apparently one even capable manufacture relevant numbers USA/EU/China.

I personally see disadvantages - lower intentions develop new stuffs big-pharma f-ups leading lower trust vaccines.

Just look EU - ordered plenty vaccines surprised companies capable delivered them. needs lot effort money increase production.

India sells vaccine world, forget actually invest big money covid vaccine productions. still 100M per month. little 1.4B population.... Plus like, bars closed drunk idiots make baby want someone know Some. Oh definitely did. saw headlines every week saying pandemic could control people would wear masks. true, could gotten thing wayyyy sooner everyone would worn mask hope hear lot athletes getting vaccinated. Would lot counter thinking “I’m young healthy, need get vaccinated? don’t know long term effects.” Pfizer submitted full authorization yet, plan end month. would imagine full approval come sometime June July.

I highly doubt budge anyone's mind, unless work somewhere mandate contingent that. 1) paper currency beds. wealth presumably ""stored"" unrealized capital gains (which losses value trying liquidate, especially wealthy forced liquidate cash once) real estate. 

2) understand international capital home US precisely robust markets orientation toward generating wealth? want capital flight top taxing engine.

3) regarding trickle itself, mistake US think would work period Globalization. closed system, jobs stay US (which requires ex-US staying impoverish) outcome might different.

per usual, details &amp; context relevant. Yeah, whiffed one This.

If want increase birthrate replacement levels fix housing healthcare. isn’t hard, build lot housing make universal healthcare thing. quiet assure Indians know exactly bad pandemic is. Indians tend fairly well educated informed. problem spread misinformation running rampant social media impacting judgement millions favor hoax treatments rather concrete science. Though hardly India problem. Oregon bad. We've never bad. Look numbers saying that. Yes, start baby months pandemic sure, risk! million deaths

I can't comprehend thing. Yes, need one. select different variants every year. should. small minority people medically fragile vaccine aside, nearly everyone gets severely ill covid point happen matter personal choice. 

I've said months I'll say again. everyone wants vaccine it, little nothing government stop inevitable outcome everyone else getting infected. 

Stop punishing us everything right, ones carrying disease contributing mutant strains forming. 

The sample size small tell us much.

fewer 30 people. unlucky case two greatly swings efficacy number. EDIT: that's 95% confidence interval 69.0%–98.3% Generally edgy type happy sort tragedy, sad see many sub really need start talking natural infection immunity afterwards. Face it, lot people refuse vaccine can’t punish compliant people taken vaccine. you’re vaccinated, you’re nearly 100% safe nothing worry it. sample size small tell us much.

fewer 30 people. unlucky case two greatly swings efficacy number. EDIT: that's 95% confidence interval 69.0%–98.3% Also suspect side effects also causing resistance. 

I think leads genuine scheduling issue. People know plan that, need make appointment time avoid missing work.

I think folks eventually get it, going trickle. It’s always shit world bro second table really interesting see. [We FYI: pressuring people getting vaccine actively figuring help. Neither hiding information (ex: telling side effects could occur after) married couples opposed becoming pregnant, know. don’t know OP’s intentions, quite commentators seem quite happy it. 9) said research, assume they've done research need accept anything say. Wait, supposed good news? thought OP posted terrible  India vastly undercounting deaths. like open secret here. Journalists noting discrepancies official figures observations ground. many vaccines India need make difference many need make OG safe?
I assume 50k vaccines isn’t going make big difference India’s 1.3bn people sure OG full FDA approval vaccines long term efficacy, safety. allergies sulfa penicillin (they make break hives) issues all, typical side effects second shot. Best luck her. covid vaccines hoping atleast get like 60 70 stories dads missing birth child heartbreaking sample size small tell us much.

Meanwhile, Eastern Washington USA, people can’t bothered go get vaccine one many sites sitting idle within miles’ drive conspiracy theory idiocy plain ignorance. It’s exasperating. sure downvoted- one way another, thing end. people get vaccinated, Covid minor annoyance, like getting annual flu shot. get annual shot, they'll end like refuseniks eventually become infected gain immunity way, they'll die. case, Covid diminish. reached near top ICU capacity, end triage, still experiencing death rate *significantly* 1st 2nd waves despite much higher case rates hospitalization numbers due variants?

Again, pandemics bad. Bad things going happen. see bad things happen country decide take *the rest world* context judge country entirely based *imagination* hoped things would go, probably going disappointed. 

If consider rest world dealing virus faced nasty third wave, third wave kill nowhere near levels earlier waves, even number people killed earlier waves much less similar countries compare response to, Canada relatively well. 

Again, want keep comparing results imagination instead countries real world, mileage certainly vary here. got fucking kidding  Nah, I'm gonna go party. Nope Whoa, neat post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Guess idiots never heard contraceptives abortion. friends symptoms, moderna. Meeting people excellent strategy, getting people vaccinated. Thank sharing this, gives hope! You’d looking health roof getting flu shot. last year, still people playing “public health ‘other people’ problem, mine” card? believe can. intended booster. Efficacy clinical trial vaccine. participant may infected, real question need hospitalized?

The point vaccine prevent death serious illness, infection. don’t think EU control Pfizer sends doses, long keep EU commitment. Hopefully Japan start putting arms soon though. friend lives rural (republican) part California said hasn’t able find appointment entire time, they’re booked solid. doesn’t Kaiser sure it’s she’s trying go county (who I’m guessing didn’t order lot vaccines) she’s really frustrated can’t get it. guess it’s lack supply high demand, knowing people live there. 

The studies map, said tend look 14-28 days first shot. 

The most-cited one CDC study. CDC's study showing 80% single-dose efficacy tiny - 4k participants (and young-ish healthcare workers).

The UK Israel ran much larger studies (24k UK one, huge 1.2M Israeli one.) UK found 72% efficacy three weeks first dose; Israel found 66%.

UK study: study: study Sweden 45%: one showing Pfizer vaccine efficacy 52% first dose 95% second dose, paper shows would zero private investment. Here’s mean robust protection

Most recent study reinfection published antibody-positivity protects reinfection least seven months 95% Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons followed median 16.3 weeks (range: 0–34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) least one PCR positive swab ≥14 days first-positive antibody test. individuals, 129 (41.1%) supporting epidemiological evidence reinfection. Reinfection next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, incidence rate reinfection estimated 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56–0.78). Incidence rate reinfection versus month follow-up show evidence waning immunity seven months follow-up. Meanwhile, complement cohort 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed median 17.0 weeks (range: 0–45.6), incidence rate infection estimated 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22–14.14). Efficacy natural infection reinfection estimated 95.2% (95% CI: 94.1–96.0%). Reinfections less severe primary infections. one reinfection severe, two moderate, none critical fatal. reinfections (66.7%) diagnosed incidentally random routine testing, contact tracing. No, no, *that* science! someone moving Boston June 1st (very excited!), I'm plenty upset gladly upvote anyone complaining it, worth noting reopening plans almost surely moved provided nothing crazy happens. MA/Boston plan announced bunch earlier reopening plans - think see revisions stay ridiculous. New research published lancet, prior covid 95% efficacy least 7 Yikes. 😕 Don’t worry it. She’ll fold like got rid former health director opposing reckless reopening plan resulted latest, awful surge cases. Yeah 32 year old woman who's due 2nd jab soon paragraph fills confidence, basically UK havnt give enough people age 2nd jab large scale judge yet.  Good got many people already worth considering points, 1. Moderna waived right enforce COVID vaccine patents October 2020. date zero companies produced own. 2. Ox/Az licenced free profit developing nations perpetuity, meaning zero profit motive anyone choosing produce viral vector analogue outside normal licencing channels. 3. SII, perhaps capable vaccine producer developing world located hottest COVID hotspots stated manufacturing capacity scale IP rights licenced facilities bottleneck.

IMO little indicate approach useful step towards containing pandemic may yet future negative consequences. 

Of terrible things gone wrong management pandemic ability pharmaceutical companies rally quickly, develop manufacture vaccines low cost bright spot. Whys labeled usa? Japanese vaccinated 4 million people far. earth EC thinking sending 72 million doses don’t use barely deaths?! doses could saved many lives across EU neighboring countries. opinion #1 #5 significant bulk resistance, I'm sure I'm allowed post opinions subreddit.

Also suspect side effects also causing resistance. scheduled vaccines dates would conducive feeling like crap days after. cases dropping country, perhaps people see catching covid less less likely event, getting side effects getting vaccine sure thing. gish gallop level misinformation lies worth engaging anymore, especially since full ignored sources data I've already shared showing bullshitting (Care share class data shows Mexico Turkey better us vaccinations? We're eager see!) 

So I'm gonna end conversation Cousin Vinny style say ""everything guy said bullshit."" swear flu getting second shot. Body aches, chills, fever, couldn’t sleep wink night. took NyQuil next day helped sleep felt much better getting sleep. Take flu meds bad side effects.  Dude Florida fine. Cases trending bit now. Oregon bad. What's even worse trying find Mental Health care children. Since COVID started many providers stopped seeing child 12 telehealth. 

There massive barrier finding mental health care, especially ones covered insurance. area needs improvement likely regulation. 

Plus average patient know need, difference PSYD, LMHC, LMFT, LCSW, MSW? intake process alone nearly nonexistent. less variants there's less people mutate  knowledge haven’t compared people got covid didn’t get shot gotten shot. I’ve seen prior covid plus one dose compared two doses.

I’m also twenties much issues low antibodies cells comes older immune compromised individuals.

Public health guidelines crafted 4th grade reading level. They’re meant shared public rarely show nuance science behind decision confusing without science background. 

I quite healthy, robust immune response, tell similar category, protection say standard American 50’s covid. 


They don’t give different guidance healthy people covid vs unhealthy people covid. Instead give blanket guidance groups.

Well like actually research make best decision health. don’t think vaccine provide protection that’s worth getting vaccine moment. I’ve seen 0.65% reinfection rates quite large studies SIRENS, Denmark, Israel, etc. reinfections tended older people 60% asymptomatic. Reinfections extremely rare, information feel safe enough contract pass covid.

Whether believe you, I’ve done research formed conclusions based research college level based generalized public health recommendations crafted 3-5th grade level.

Most recent study reinfection published antibody-positivity protects reinfection least seven months 95% Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons followed median 16.3 weeks (range: 0–34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) least one PCR positive swab ≥14 days first-positive antibody test. individuals, 129 (41.1%) supporting epidemiological evidence reinfection.

Idiots. going make first shot worthless. never going back normal guys. many idiots running around. That’s huge IF. 
Let’s hope so. Got second shot yesterday place close empty. sad. necessarily hoax, think it’s big deal/treatable. know people whose loved ones died, basically shrug blame literally anything else COVID.  

I’ve heard all. “Grandpa going dead year anyway.” “She didn’t take care health kind asking it.” “The doctors really shitty didn’t use (*insert X fad treatment gets discredited month later.*)” Covaxin raw materials sourced India. raw materials Serum really wanted US manufacture Novavax vaccine.  Yup. Apparently become 18 get +100 knowledge many shipped.... zero?

Hopefully export start long want human trials boosters target variants way go straight production *if turns need them.* So, trials happen results get reported on. still entirely possible Moderna-classic provide enough protection, variant-targeting boosters never mass-produced. US/UK/EU select countries, getting first jab task itself. allow exports, since recently. Pfizer started exporting US plant couple weeks ago. know strawman means? 
The Indian people done best. However, government response massive failure beginning.



The first lockdown worse useless. devastated poor Indians, wasted valuable resources could’ve spent current surge. Cases peaked several months lockdown ended.


Right now, people exhausted, India limited resources deal pandemic. Meanwhile, Modi covering information. people legitimately seem believe likely die vaccination covid. 

I actually know people serious side effects vaccine (and know J&amp;J blood clot issue) I'm still little surprised widespread belief is. We’re still ways point Philly, finally point appointments hard get. Basically everyone know gotten first dose point, least scheduled it. 😁 Toyota given good life past 15 years. Fantastic company work for. Plus, deal side effects potentially large number people alternative illness. fully vaccinated, wearing mask buildings require it, cloth mask even necessary anymore? would measly non-medical disposable mask work fine? Indian variant can't even outcompete UK variant Northern India infections rampant. think okay. can't generalize people like that. voted Trump I'm vaccinated. Mocking people way get right thing. think interesting thing regards stores Walmart won’t 24 hours anymore. Idk messes head  India world’s largest producer vaccines already. Ahh no? mean America gave largest amount Moderna, pretty much sole financre vaccine alone. support blocking exports EU (save companies fail meet domestic commitments). start slow plenty vaccines delivered currently, summer coming. time many countries little domestic production basically relying EU exports.

Why necessarily bad EU exports doses uses domestically? global pandemic all. rare platelet disorder causes clotting would already know first dose.  Yay don't. stuff heavily contributed public funds, university research government grants. 

Nice propaganda though. get it. do. don't.  Impatient little thing, aren’t ya? Why? feel need laugh somebody else's decision? affecting you? know story they've trough. Maybe lost somebody close COIVD scared? Leave be. private companies get reward terms sales normal decent people need paid right thing

There already companies giving money employees getting vaccine goes gratitude never-ending respect. I'll try buy products first chance get. know. trying stay optimistic instead usual semi-cynical self.    much fact vaccine effective UK variant mean SA variant compete UK variant point.

UK may contagious vaccines undo extent giving SA variant leg up.

Not terribly concerned either way. adding conversation.  India president however Modi prime minister important put perspective India obviously underreporting 

Exactly.  checks always theater 

They recently caught Argentina dude Covid going back Miami fake negative certificate. Dude positive PCR American Airlines put flight nevertheless (with fake certificate without showing PCR). caught reached Buenos Aires temp camera saw fever. passengers risk. Always upvoted certain group folks. find Muslims getting lot blame spreading virus obviously true. know causing blood clots, giving certain answer currently impossible

But actually odd. J&amp;J AZ utilitize technology. adenovirus vaccines, uses another virus vectors (they however use different vectors).

Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech uses completely different technology, mRNA. carries genetic code spike protein ised SARS-CoV-2. body's cells produces protein (which completely harmless itself), detect produce antibodies. virus included.

Not area expertise though, keep mind may details.  Oh, know. It’s took could get soon able to.  Huh. sigh. 😫 non-death, long-term COVID risks table, also put non-death, long-term risks imposing ~2 years abnormality children table.

I think simple that. Many states shut schools long, organized activities kids shut down, family kid different factors play. think fair families already problems may gotten worse, result kids worse problems stuck parents often. Others good families may thrived parents able spend time them. kids shuffled one activity next every day may benefitted less sports such, time hang kids. kids children likely got lonely kids sibling around age play friends within ""bubble"" play dates with. many factors able make clear statement good bad kids. first Moderna shot gave side effects second (assuming don’t develop - got second shot 24 hours ago). first shot felt like got hit arm baseball bat brain fog. Shot 2 feels like flu shot, arm slightly sore muscles little stiff. 100%. gym wash hands 20 seconds, mandatory temp check free wallow around room 0 ventilation.

I fucking hate covid theater. problem?  New evidence suggests dominant British Variant effectiveness much lower. Low 50 percentish. 

Source: currently Serbia (instead 25 euros) understand people even come things like this. world truly insane. want get vaccine personal reasons, fine whatever. go spreading around complete BS like scare everyone else away. Thank reporting her, hope ban permanent! There’s this. would investors fund expensive challenging research, results hard work innovation given away? think innovation?  wear comfy cloth one, woman walking alone night, changed life wear mask range 2x 6x reported deaths, absolutely insane. 

[Using Worldometers would make 7 day average deaths 7,240 21,720 per day. number people who've died last month would 130,000 390,000 using multiplier range. Trade going largely uninterrupted. Truck drivers even required quarantine. likely vaccine efficacy Indian variant higher South African variant. Neutralization studies lab show antibodies neutralize Indian variant well original virus, better South African variant. predominant vaccine India also seems effective variant (though vaccination rates India high single digits, they're far away kind noticeable population-wide effect vaccine). 

I think terrible situation India human behavior infrastructure, rather immune escape variant. Low vaccination rates, high population density, poverty societal issues lead lack effective measurements including masking, lockdowns social distancing, massive election rallies religious celebrations, etc. essentially would see, even original virus, opened everything up. Thank service! God love Japanese vehicles  realise EU doesn’t doses? They’re manufactured EU they’re ordered Japan made Pfizer.

Might actually happen tehn, although doubt much alleviate situation India. something become important end year, all. Yeah, well that's politics. takes tremendous amount political capital take preventative measures infection rate low. People thought end virus need precautions. good politician makes difficult decisions country even popular one. Germany, Italy, countries situation. pretend everything control clearly not. Anyone like know lot people still think virus hoax created democrats? That’s still effective J&amp;J shot, one dose like 66% effective. believe CDC considers shot 50% effective. people already vaccinated gained safe able things safely several weeks already. remember reply clearly. right man.

I bought new car last year, manufactured either January 2020 December 2019, forget which. 

Most new cars built several months get dealer lot, supply takes respond material shortages. Car sales surprisingly strong last year, shortages really hit later year year. totally fair points. old enough see difference though. Family US. Liberty moved north Trump elected imho. appears re-battling events past. (Actually, once)

Perhaps need better angels speak MUCH louder. Yor PR comment sticks me. Thanks engagement. I'm going play devil's advocate devil's advocate, study reaching draw conclusions. based white, highly educated, wealthier 2003 study. 

2003 anti-vax different covid anti-vax today. 2003 anti-vax autism, covid anti-vax microchips, ""covid exist"", etc. 

I believe use 2003 data support claim today. they're completely different scenarios. [30% mental/neurological organ damage young low risk  Darkmode created? do, hell do. putting much faith ""free market."" Sorry, honest. 

MANY countries rigid import/export regimes would stand way importing cheaper vaccines, particularly embargoed, sanctioned governments ""open persuasion,"" (read: bribery). 

The reason price issue right sole manufacturers setting price. circumstance, ironically corporation keeping price low since MASSIVE reserves place set kind losses ""missed profit"" could make. would also PR nightmare priced vaccine high.

Along - look opposite side equation: manufacturers price vaccine developers pricing, end winning business since research development costs recooperate - handed patent. 

I get it, want believe automatically positive, that's assuming global market operates ""fairness,"" equality, certainly not. made couple billions, bothered, really. Fake numbers aren’t automatically true someone says are.

Also, 1% death rate assumes everyone getting proper treatment. people literally dying streets, clearly happening. Canadian supports South Korea clamping choose.  It’s South Korea decide want Canadians travel not.

South Korea makes decisions border. Canada makes decisions border. USA makes decisions border.

I’m ready masks go, they’re annoying. mostly want gone it’s sign *begin* putting COVID behind us. ""I'm gonna wait till offer $1000"" number going higher without social distancing masking. believe still think number around 80%. 

We still social distancing posture drops see relative that. Think way, three waves one period declining cases. first two 0% population vaccinated. due social distancing. social distancing before, still major factor.

If start opening concerts sporting events maskless people need higher percentage people vaccinated.

One good thing urban areas vaccinating higher rate rural. effectively herd immunity urban areas need higher percentage people vaccinated rural areas. Well certainly showing evidence science fucking work enough vaccines people waiting many dying think situation India highlights don’t want spend next decade lockdown fighting different variants constant vaccination programme overhead, virus needs dealt international way.

As Brit, hasn’t vaccine yet, wish started supporting countries now. low case rates, high uptake amongst even remotely vulnerable stopped we’d probably ok. need international systemic approach tackling virus. goal make 50 things save lives people around you, yourself. get shot sneeze shoppers safely again.

Also, amusement parks filled would kids, can’t get vaccinated yet. yeah, vaccinated person probably extremely unlikely catch spread COVID going amusement park, especially it’s mostly outside activities crowded, wouldn’t say it’s “literally harm” isn’t super obvious “common sense” slam dunk. Boomers want get vaccinated AZ young people get take AZ vaccine want to. get freedoms back fully vaccinated, get second shot four weeks (even though twelve weeks efficient). That's awesome. Since we're essential transportation facility interruptions service since beginning pandemic. Toyota gave us extra 15 PTO days last year. Definitely took edge off. They're still projecting 2 billion doses end year. somehow approval keeps happening everywhere even though plenty trial results perfect safety profile. combination B C. also hilarious think anyone foreign monitoring situation China, though. China kicked foreign media reporting situation. CCP tight grip narrative constantly twists make look better. good way point individual responsibility means controlling pandemic flawed.

The prime minister went national television, issued national lockdown first thing people meet look lack crowds 🙄

That isn’t using individual responsibility. government telling people people plain ignoring it. I've heard bad idea developing immunity vaccination.

That said, drink like fish, stop vaccine, so, whoops? Alcohol depresses immune system probably contra-indicated. doubt matters much.

Very odd. anyone link original paper? giving benefits people already vaccinated? People FOMO getting vaccinated see vaccinated friends getting limited time free benefits Yes. faced vaccine shortages government prioritized getting many people possible immunity quickly possible.  sleazy restaurant owners take money still pay nothing treat employees like garbage whining can’t fill positions? math support achievable. First dose rates go get - they're still falling. would agree cases human behavior incentivize something look many would come take advantage it. going copypasta. already one, card personal records.

Reading actual report show aspect indeed accounted  Quick Question, I'm get vaccinated curious still go ham alcohol tonight? Viral vector vaccines like J&amp;J AZ new well, though. two approved vaccines technology prior covid, ebola vaccines.

However, would've major side effects mRNA vaccines, still seen given number people vaccinated. third phase, ending mask mandate, set 70% state’s eligible population received least one dose vaccine. governor’s office says state track reach benchmark end June. Even so, 70% benchmark isn’t reached, mask mandate still end July 1.

This governors need do. Vaccinated people forced wear masks forever foolish people want shot.   good way point individual responsibility means controlling pandemic flawed. However, it’s terrible argument claim Indian people haven’t enough. 

There billions people India. think exact thing wouldn’t happened country government let everyone decide one you’re mistaken. 

And that’s even accounting disparities education access information. first vaccine actually effective iirc, announced effective data back up. would trust follow CDC quarantine data. Anecdotally, I’ve noticed people coming hospital around days 7-10 onset symptoms. seems some, day seven things either get better decline pretty quickly. Wow really hate Brits. spout nonsense like really care interested BS politics. posted say AZ sold cost correct.

British outstanding job vaccinating people admired. 
The EU dragged feet tried bully play games people's life. Thank god part anymore. brother Moderna reacted same. mother Pfizer got violent vomiting. weird Virus gonna virus, variants likely matter, ever.

Vaccine gonna vaccinate. work better thought 2020.

For J&amp;J, effectiveness seems increase time. We'll likely get better data months, meantime, worry yourself, worry getting people vaccinated. study linked to, 29 people caught COVID 14+ days first dose, 2 vaccinated 27 vaccinated (look Table 1).

With tiny sample size, gigantic confidence range unlucky cases lucky non-cases greatly skew efficacy rate.   irony *certainly* lost me! Comparing US India data shape form pointless, even adjust population. India's data terms absolute numbers total garbage. usefulness India's data hoping least capturing signal trend. Source? time double check, know i'm correctly interpreting three sources linked came conclusion me, quote took directly ""***What study adds***"" part article.

Here's another source - head danish department health said joint studies based Danish Norwegian health data estimated one 40,000 people vaccinated AstraZeneca shot could expect experience serious complication, nothing conclusive related age something wrong interpretation. Happy look time later.. sick dog 3 days. say stronger reaction better antibodies... let's hope got good ones right? Oh, seems hard then. 56.7% adults already done. unimaginable think 13% get next 2 months available local events / vaccine drives / office clinics / sporting events etc countries close herd immunity yet.

The U.S. particularly well administration change took country worst response best response. wonder long COVID like them. dad thinks A. CCP purposely orchestrated lab leak B. pandemic exaggerated make trump look bad Yeah, basically reserve list people yet eligible. We've Belgium since mid-April. Good see France addressing problem though. chance getting spreading communicable respiratory disease never zero.

But fully vaccinated, chances getting COVID transmitting drastically lowered, enough really worry it, especially vaccinated individuals. risk two vaccinated individuals catching spreading COVID completely negligible. towards 'holesome', makes fun reddit's wholesome culture variant killing high enough percent quick enough make difference spread.

I would separate idea patent issue monopoly. true monopoly little incentive improve, automatically case holder patent, since often near-substitutes, course, patents expire.

He framed CDC said this. countries people could live practically COVID-free free restriction limited few, countries planet, almost like statistical anomaly. somehow all: effective governance, compliance people, geographical advantage (more island-like).

I think miss first 30-60 days hard containment (Feb/March 2020), country doomed, even doomed large country. hope people voluntarily comply (most won't, look around world) hospital system sustain patient loads (most can't, except richest countries). 

Hindsight 20/20... asked Dec 2019 would bet pandemic life would better: US vs. Vietnam... best would temporarily relocate D7 January 2020 VN closed borders, come back U.S. March 2021 started making vaccines available people. lmao

It would heartbreaking tragedy VN manage keep COVID bay. hospital system less robust, things go sour fast. Kids hardly spread deaths age group small, population. bigger challenge vaccine hesitant adults Asymmetric risk. vaccinated, way less summer 2020. course know much multiple ways. unvaccinated, similar risk last summer, cases drop. Lmao, next time pandemic comes around companies say ""well last time vaccine producers made billion dollars, guess worth try"". Especially r&amp;d risks practically 0 governments throwing money even approved product. Pharmaceutical companies would pay good money keep spouting talking points, hope free! opinion, get 70% 7/4? everything right get nothing, public health nuisance giant piece shit everyone falls cater you. infuriating. yet west tested wife almost instantly despite doc saying thought sore throat unlikely covid. handful cases ken, probably felt safe test without risk positive. Quite honestly care vaccine acceptance. may callous, that's problem solves itself. ??? Literally lmfaoo sub sus man year...or more?! Insanity Plus people running CT Scan tests RT PCR use medical help detecting CT score Covid pneumonia. numbers American Academy Pediatrics. said 13% cases children. 1-3% cases end hospitalization. never said 1-3% children TOTAL. He’s weak letting people die  Yeah 12 year old 5 inches taller wife. Can’t wait get shot.  used en masse US, SA variant basically non existent. hard say.  Seriously guy real news  I'm sad reading this. know people life saying cray things saying 'it make sense' dih issues AZ vaccine faced new variants discovered days probably it'd better people AZ could given booster shot Pfizer/Moderna year effective variants Please refer comment thread point first dose worse second. next day sore achy woke went away coffee Advil lol. yeah, sucks effects really bad people NYC public schools remote learning instead snow days next year.

I guess remote learning good enough New Yorkers past year use acceptable replacement snow days going forward. Except BS A&amp;W CEO saving face tried compete McDonalds failed. Hence A&amp;W never tried sell ""1/5th pounder"" McDonald's market kids burgers ""1/6th pounders"". published yet working boosters cover variants. Oh no, we'll lose dumbest employees Team Pfizer, represent! CDC said this? Director agency at-large? Goodnews, everyone! India finally Covid control, two weeks ago, things bad even rich treated human beings. reason think Moderna also effective variants? think people need lot of
persuading definitely avoiding J&amp;J now. offer one 2 addition. u/attaboy000

People naturally infected 84% protected according SIREN study, dont know effect preventionof severe COVID-19 84% lower risk becoming reinfected 93% lower risk symptomatic infection 7 months follow-up, according findings large, multicenter study published late last week in The par *one single dose either vaccine, participants’ risk infection SARS-CoV-2 reduced 80 percent two weeks vaccination.


And asymptomatic infection, too. Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine 91.3% effective 6 months second dose 100% effective severe disease defined US Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC), according updated data today phase 3 efficacy starting two weeks following second dose based updated adjudicated cases remains consistent prior updates, including greater 90% cases COVID-19, greater 95% severe cases IT. mean, fully vaccinated, odds favor 1) die 2) get severely sick 3) spread mean, got shots man... I'm pro mask, pro lockdown come, I'm fully vaccinated, already flown two different states, eaten restaurant gone movie. liberating reality nurses this. true many countries, India. want to, nowhere enough resources try save every patient.

Give nurse doctor hug. working limits beyond person endure. doesn’t matter vaccines stop transmission fully vaccinated individuals allowed travel see families loved ones. We’re tired living Facetime Zoom. It’s fault Justin Trudeau botched vaccine purchasing start pandemic. Canada literally relying North Dakota vaccinate truck drivers. good thing anyways. last administration horrible damage relationship Canada Biden Trudeau already good friends. Extending border closure longer damage economies. don’t send vaccines Canada allows time mutant breed. Meanwhile mental health crisis fully vaccinated mothers separated children Canada it’s deemed non-essential travel. Pathetic. 

It needs re-opened vaccine passport like we’re EU summer. waste time make argument believe anything say. fact think CCP corrupt think they're lying numbers says all. Ask non-Chinese Epi they'll tell China's numbers make sense. They're clearly BS. Look “Pfizer vaccine efficacy curve” you’ll see study, new cases stayed unvaccinated group 10 days, mostly stopped climbing. It’s sharp turn. think could probably subtract average incubation time symptomatic covid (is 3-5 days?) guess effective protection new exposure starts 5-7 days first dose. There’s discernible change slope second dose, numbers pretty small would hard see change. 

My (not doctor) understanding second shot might important long-term protection, based immune systems work, actual change vaccine’s short term (months?) efficacy.

I friend got positive covid test two days first vaccine shot. thinks exposed day got shot, deal (and family also got sick) couple weeks. He’s OK now. There’s definitely window *after* shot come it. whole deal spooked enough put back March-2020 style lockdown week first dose. barely left house. ""huge criticism"" warp speed people US got much vaccine fast can't even use all. side effects felt first Moderna shot soreness injection site 24 hours. I’m getting second shot soon heard one brunt side effects, I’m bracing it. Israel got second dose Saturday I'm starting feel normal. Managed get back working yesterday still wiped evening. Arm still hurting swollen site right armpit lymph nodes still bit swollen. waiting results too. Supposed come month. host infectious long enough period dying. study handy UK Canada real-world data showing lasting effectiveness today. read heard confirmation immunity, far good.

It's open question, tons people looking lots angles.

I can't stress enough remarkable vaccines are. pandemic well could end saving way lives lost. Ray hope end dark tunnel. Warp speed gets credit? Look US vs rest world. Laughable comment Good thing got J&amp;J 🙄 look visualization colored blobs, one represents county. click give data 65+ 18+. It’s quite you’re asking for, give insight. think understand many various sectors within pharmaceutical device company. Except hes trying cut funding one unless leaves whole world going feel including you, deforesting issue. second dose 5/1 today still getting exhausted way earlier normal. Slept away Sunday, worked Monday passed 8, managed return working yesterday work full day, still exhausted evening, I'm little less tired today. Swollen lymph nodes arm STILL period got messed first one anticipate again. Wow, considerate them. wants pet pandemic returns them. That’s messed man. got covid 13 days first shot :( Pfizer. Asymptomatic though! Wouldn’t make sense viruses evolve infectious less lethal?

Canada's issue vax supply. US got ~3.5 million doses per day demand fell off... 1.2 million doses/day peak falling steadily. supply still ramping up. 

If prioritized excess supply canada, would wrap issue pretty quick. Even assumed change status quo, giving excess doses Canada implied far peak, Canada would ahead US dose per capita less month.

Oh, US states already collectively inventory unadministered doses give every canadian 2 doses, let alone # meet current unfilled demand canada. woman schedule parents, husband, myself. last get family.

As country bought stuff wanted anyone else. Whether something called warpspeed US Army Quartermaster Corps totally immaterial. Capitalism works. Warpspeed gets credit.  got Pfizer. first one, arm hurt bit, nothing major. Went away two days, started day shot.

After second shot, arm sore within six hours, next day zero energy, whole body ached, brain foggy hell, sixteen hour long, full-head headache. Every member family know got Pfizer similar stuff first second doses, nearly exactly mirrored other. Makes wonder could genetic component side effects. countries aren’t VN/NZ... think idea ""you get sick someone symptoms"" still well-supported current evidence. distinction pre-symptomatic asymptomatic suspected pretty early scientific community, penetrate public consciousness much later, maybe get far even then.

People liky trust random pharmacist CVS Yup worse, I'm 65 four weeks since first shot, plan second. I'm Alberta premiere really screwed up, sigh... conspiracy theories one going incredible gross misunderstanding debt works national/international level. Federal government actually must incur debt order credit borrow international market. sole reason 1st Bank U.S. created (and later Fed reserve). 

The Federal government operating deficit even high 30 trillion dollars really issue, especially extremely low interest rates Fed international markets. People harp debt realize U.S. needs bone crushing levels debt (like we're talking north 100 trillion dollars here) become problematic especially interest rates borrow (2% less). Pfizer testing booster too. want prepared case variants mutate become increasingly less effective. want target mutations currently boosters get worse mess think huge reason behind vaccine hesitancy. groups vaccinated people like president cabinet, like Broadway workers, still wear masks like nothing changed. people able see getting vaccinated allow take masks around vaccinated people, would push Ben Shapiro strongly favor vaccinations Anecdotally, swva town, people got pregnant higher rate pandemic. Many single moms. Seriously, cringe AF need defense $$$ middle east exit. China is. Hmm, listen to, CDC reddit comment? 🤔 need vaccination passports ASAP. India 1 billion people. millions COVID cases. Frankly, million going go far. Lol, heck get another shot. large point acted like two doses vaccine sufficient  know Israeli cases trickle right now, anybody happen know percentage cases Indian variant Israel? Fuck become boomer can't vaccinated Canadians come down? in-laws Canadian seen grandchildren year. They're vaccinated. Sure first send us 50 million doses Pfizer. yes and. I'm poor mean see factors too. implication perhaps something else caused death, combination. two weeks ago,nobody us 80 also fully vaccinated(two weeks out) died covid. mean Moderna making booster? Yeah lot countries strategy like prevent spread. It’s terrible idea - worked well far countries done - suck fact everyone needs wait long atomic scientists? Okay, sure, trial ""over time"" dealing actually got COVID, % interpreted applied individual fact time encounter COVID. trial conducted via groups/time mean way use efficacy applies way.

This good video explaining probably fail  im writing this, 3 states already met surpassed bidens goal vaccinating 70% adults. 6 states less 5% away hitting goal well. combined, 9 states represent 14.5 million vaccinated peoples. issue however, 12 states vaccinated less 50% adult population, dont math figure slackers represent far bigger % u.s.

For controversy surrounding Newsom recall him, administration prevented lot deaths. masked working dust all, much burden change them

this what's confusing me, lot contractors kind work wore masks time anyway, sudden medical conditions *preventing* so? curious 🤔 experience first. second exactly same. personal read 8 days dose 2 pretty much good you’re going be. Pfizer analysis 1 week dose 2 Moderna 2 weeks though I’d expect similar numbers. 

 8 days post dose 2 feel like I’d comfortable indoor dining family tonight. Though risk calculation there’s nothing wrong conservative slow. I'm sure literally anything said correct. way. imagine vaccinated test. 1 dose Pfizer AstraZeneca provides enough protection. look UK’s cases. Even Patty Hajdu Dr. Tam Canada’s doctors officials thing agree completely. guess what? already come agreement UK, EU, mind many European countries way Covid-19 cases Canada, fully vaccinated citizens travel countries/continents summer. excuses allow mental health families continue suffer vaccine works, even 1 dose. enough vaccines 2/3rd Canadians fully vaccinated July, there’s word even concrete plan then, it’s pure incompetency point. depends massively vaccine.

mRNA vaccines biggest change symptom onset around day 11, implying protection infection within J&amp;J protection symptom onset around day 16, implying protection within 2 AZ change around day 26 so, implying protection start around week 3 assume protection continue increase, significant part change seems happen vaccines.

You’re right. It’s proven. two teens dying week taking vaccine don’t know good idea. Trump urged people get vaccinated, including several times since leaving office. There’s Republican celebrity bigger him. Additionally, prominent conservatives—someone mentioned Ben Shapiro—are vocally pro-vaccine.   guess that's Canadians entering U.S. vaccine. Lots vaccines U.S. vaccination sites CVS, Walgreens, Safeway, etc. second shot made feel sickest I've felt decade. Oh god, yeah.

As Chinese, still ask Chinese leaders help. worst outcome Modi saying no, maybe say yes ways help. Hesitant people follow news. filter it.

They read following :

1. read several times one dose ~85% effective

2. read reach herd immunity, unvaccinated possibly protected.

They filter following

1. second dose provides strong lasting immunity

2. Coronavirus come back community external sources. See new Zealand Australia. ""Google find sources agree despite evidence contrary"" There’s difference poor people US poor people poor nations. Poor nations tend higher birth rates there’s lower survival rate kids used work. Either directly working land, adding external income family whats going happen NEXT time need firms come rescue spending massive resources pull miraculous cure months? Maybe remember robbed hard intellectual property, let us die. would hard blame them, profit firms, charities.

 like patents whats holding vaccinations anyway, manufacture distribution bottlenecks. broken, fix it!  can't hard. Make database everyone who's vaccinated. Check IDs border. Cross reference database. Done. Hajahahaha Give us world feel guilty bringing people it. want grandkids, start making world grow in.

* ridiculously successful high-vaccination countries (UK, Israel) research efficacy. beginning confirm worked, it’s determine duration. take booster, antibody response would skewed. parents India way talk India superpower #3 right behind US China.

India could #3 right now. potential trapped corruption elites worldwide problems please.  Except critical condition. Google look something news article.  leaders accused government creating panic name second wave. surprise. people money India treated human beings 

Reminds rich postal codes Florida got first dips vaccine Life Beautiful scheduled Las Vegas mid September wondering get delayed kind time decline gently, climate critical condition all. Maybe sharp decline bad social stability, good earth.  One dose seems sufficiently effective OG COVID. many variants require two doses sufficient effectiveness, likely overtake original strain already. Get doses.  scheduled yours? province in? first month ago, told try book pharmacy sometime early August. Alberta though it’s bit unorganized though. right, thank you.

Japan weird, doctors local universities also strongly covid vaccine released studies whatnot making confidence lower lower.

The government also helping taking pictures getting ""vaccinated"" fake syringe lmao.

Japan, advanced country advanced mind.  time..? Birthrates plunging decades. population growth seeing generations past (if seeing all: birthrates low across Japan Russia Europe already starting decrease population). Birthrates falling great thing (at least fast) I’m right you. love tasting food lol lol Literally going outside bounds tested. 42 days maximum guaranteed work full effectiveness. Way cavalier taking life death. shows?

There alignment US currently state-specific. Rolling Loud happening July Miami. I'd also note north vs south thing. 

Just highlight: Boston (the vaccinated city America) announced last week bars open 8/22 bands already canceled shows. NYC, NJ CT said would full capacity bars two weeks' time within days MA's announcements.  

TLDR: Depends running state want visit.  Yeah we're pretty quick roll back measures work places pretty quick get people back office measures ""necessary"".

Like sorry pandemic over...? another Q-hotel breach. Sigh.

Finger crossed guys! Hopefully spread far. bad time bring pride nationalism. COVID vaccines also found provide pretty good protection asymptomatic infection. called testing facility I’m coming 1-year anniversary first injection mild panic attack Pfizer end BioNTech said would booster 6-12 months. There’s nothing pipeline yet giving us one. said if/when happened it’ll fast, it’ll come regulators would timeline attached it. guess want get 12 month lab work anything done. variant booster targeted fall don’t go 2 year check-in...this gets sticky, allow us get booster want wait full 2 years determine efficacy? I’m trying think much. It’s okay it’s “uNdEr COntrOL” makes sad. One fondest childhood memories 2 day long snow day played goldeneye start finish 🖤💖💛 many people turned away anything hit covid capacity? Yes, get it.

I find really weird 'let's incentivize people get vaccine' thing, even giving people free tickets money get something that's needed parts world. I'm blaming shaming you, bizarre. Like living alternate reality US right now.

I guess one things like mom tells people starving want eat vegetables measures covid bad, weren’t greedy desperate Olympics, Japan might pandemic now. Yet Japanese people still choose LDP brain dead.  COVID vaccines currently approved US use adjuvants. post removed article title likely sensationalized. Please use source less sensationalist title instead.

In trial, [one severe case placebo group, none vaccine group; 95% credible interval is, basically, useless. Good points. lot solutions beyond ridiculously simplistic binary ""leave everything exactly is"" ""destroy IP healthcare really hope scientists keep delivering results care."" Lipid nanoparticles pretty niche. I'd surprised many facilities ready make without setting qualifying new lab process. NC mainly got Pfizer vaccine lots it. Wonder anything big Pfizer center Sanford. reward getting vaccinated vaccinated

If folks need carrot I'm fine read “party” rereading title makes sense forget short months ago hitting 250,000-350,000 cases **daily** , we’ve begun see finish line solely due vaccines it’s like world forgot daily horror show reported everywhere outside U.S. see successful vaccine rollout they’re angry we’re making sure entire population vaccinated?

Vaccinating kids/teens absolutely key beating virus that’s we’re doing. empathize guys much though seriously hope guys get vaccinated soon, neighbors south need help hope we’re able send doses asap. practical reason behind idea? get concept unmasked reward, understand unvaccinated people wearing masks protects anyone. mean, also understand vaccinated people wear masks, suggesting. Probably won’t even matter nationwide; cdc moratorium set expire June anyway. federal Gov surely appeal/delay ruling least long e-learning instead snow days Indianapolis years (at least last 5 years). It’s nice definitely know last day school isn’t moving. 800 billion per year small fry. Landlords bills affects banks jobs isn’t any. idiots calling hyper inflation last 15 yrs. 

Not mention velocity money absolutely tanked. P1 (Brazilian variant)  Thanks kicked Cancer's ass great That’s thought (along lines anyway). saved comment. ""exposure"" attack rate 1 unvaccinated individual, except perhaps someone decided working invasive ventilators zero PPE good idea. 

Yep, pessimistically start visitor Skagit Valley Chorale situation, leave exercise reader figure far person. argue hardly anybody's going position, certainly true. imagine we'd wind reasonably close numbers solving problem. think there’s California variant too, nothing worry though seems.

Edit: looked it’s variant B.1.427/B.1.429. Seriously, made effort get one, get 2nd. Great world, unfortunately might dissuade big pharma players investing treatment future pandemics unless system “buy out” patents Greece cannot inflation since don’t even control currency. problem opposite lol mean, you’re cautioning n=30, you’re suggesting new serotypes inevitable 0 studies. I’m fairly confident SARS-CoV-2 going mutate SARS-CoV-3. (Which would new Serotype)

Common cold HCoVs don’t mutate particularly fast much NL63 serotype that’s around 1000 years. There’s hundreds viruses cause limited upper respiratory illnesses don’t develop long lasting antibodies (but SARS seems have) think we'll get back things like pretty short order. kind game chicken one wants go first get dunked super spreader, point someone take risk it'll become abundantly clear big events like safely resume. thought whole concept IQ, therefore IQ tests, valid. used dunk people like? Isn’t California variant too? Lol it’s pretty wild actually.

Honestly shocked wasn’t Florida variant. one myocarditis, condition often goes away without complications caused variety viruses similar number cases reported previous years? live Deep South equivalent San Diego. plenty “I don’t trust vaccine” types here, sadly.

Though decide get got vaxxed didn’t die. there’s that. People wonder vaccine hesitancy government making extremely easy sit home day watch cartoons. needs end unemployment needs get rolled back pre-pandemic levels. Let's make sure know ""delivery"" means: SOLD vaccine United States. normal transaction. want goods, pay them. stated facts.

However, capable PM? opinion, man like hover around even 2 kilometres near Prime Minister's office. look economic policies Congress passes there’s exactly much difference lift patients That’s real promising B.1.351! even “symptomatic covid” infection. Well expectations would think! China's ""vaccine diplomacy"" deemed bad, America's ""vaccine diplomacy"" accepted good? public health reasoning people pandemic going really holding water anymore either. Anyone wants vaccine get one plenty job openings. Get shot, get job pay rent. city sending nurses door door vaccines, ready answer questions excuses anyone may have. feel like going convince people it’s great. also setting tents beach parks walk appointments. see two connected polls shown republicans highest group vaccine hesitancy? must smart Repost? Lol fully understand herd immunity vaccines work. I'm continuing follow CDC recommendations. sake discussion though, convince people get vaccinated? probably can't. point, people stupid bare minimum year feel bad die.   across US struggling take growing number dogs cats. pets adopted early pandemic sent back owners slowly return normal life. financial impact Covid-19 well puppy boom due pause spaying neutering pandemic also adding strain. see two connected. voted Trump got vaccinated soon state let me. Academic conference attracts around 300 people going happen masks distancing October vaccination proof (every attendee vaccinated). Well, today announced cancelled going try winter 2022. genuinely feels like never ending, set goals, get point, shit still doesn’t change. tired beat all... Aka - everyone gotten vaccine gives thumbs-up lol. It’s odd know two hardcore anti-vaccine people got Covid vaccine. One coworker high risk doctor gave serious talk (even vaccinating child baby), kind new age hippie young woman frightened first came around others knew got felt fine.

Another (a coworker) terrified virus high risk, masks up, won’t even go haircut, works home, refuses shot whacky naturopath told shots bad. plan wait out? forcing back office summer.  way companies acting terms boosters yes. actual studies no. http://www.healthdata.org/node/8584

AZ 6% effective preventing infection SA variant, 10% effective preventing disease SA variant. There's absolutely evidence increase allergies side-effect COVID-19 restrictions. No, that’s kind clotting. Again, AZ clotting issue caused *specific kind immune response*. vaccines drugs, like heparin, cause well. It’s rare, they’re entirely sure affects certain people, risk factors types clot disorders don’t seem relate this. specific test determine whether someone affected VIPIT recommended someone experiences clot symptoms specific symptoms AZ shot. causes treatment regimens entirely different. treatments usually used clots actually make VIPIT worse probably contributed initial high death I’m sure people India would walk hell back vaccine right yet assholes needing paid get it. Sad!  ...pto also taxed brought idea management meeting, company gives money someone reaction bedridden one ""one million"" things technically could happen, company could liable. Walgreens gave $5 reward cash spend got second dose. wasn’t expecting anything nice buy candy after. totally this. close windows opened priority. example, you’re 60, 30 days start vaccination, supplies allocated younger excess shipped abroad. also give retroactively, bit expensive solve problems state that. Great! Imagine saying old people dying covid privileged Americans giving vaccinations teenagers.

As old people included Olympic delegations, I'm sure come developed countries already vaccinates don't, part point, underprivileged people underprivileged countries.

Like said above, let's think institutions countries, care many poor countries also part Olympics, care people, largely unaffected Olympics pushed another year benefit much receiving vaccine (like fcking dying) compared benefit prioritizing vaccines Olympics translates Olympics year instead next year. 

Go tell old person India country unable vaccinate vulnerable population suffering die covid lives worth less pushing Olympics another year. get 2nd shot? reason labs manufacture themselves. knowhow hand building vaccine doses companies patents mass producing technology. plan retroactive would terrible, since would give people reason wait incentives.  humor? Idea. people mild reaction. Mild like staying bed 24 hours.
I first shot, would eligible company money others get it? cool. get fucked, covid, variants. found incentive “less likely die contribute others dying” sufficient incentive me, fair. company provides 10 day PTO experience side effects Basically, Pfizer trials using two doses doesn’t sufficient data submit EUA approval one dose. It’s also unknown immunity protection single dose regiment last long. govt job gave us 4 hours specifically take vaccine time, additional 3 hours free time us use whenever, long show HR vaccine card. Yeah, hoping kid get first dose next week stop worrying much people idiots. Without patents maybe AZ would started manufacturing mRNA instead continuing controversial candidate. Also China probably could make decent copy bad geopolitically. Seriously. I'm getting little salty benefits rewarding people waited. live NJ get free beer get shot May. really can't even make retroactive? like million dollar beer. dunno man, weeks ago got lectured whole bunch people sub saying going back normal got fully vaccinated, 🤷‍♀️ GET VACCINATED - DID! Lmao. makes think truly dangerous mutation come this?  Seems bit rant say okay discuss things rough online lol probably way I'd get one. I've busy time get shot, paid would worth taking time work. I'm sorry 😔 haven’t seen claim you’re responding to, since post got removed, want address question excess mortality. Excess mortality calculated using averages past years given day, week, month serve estimate many people would expect died corresponding day/week/month present. Excess mortality calculated subtracting number actual mortality timespan: it’s positive, people died expected, it’s negative, fewer died. 

So, thing note changes mortality rates aren’t influenced covid deaths: they’re also affected changes causes death. ability affected behavioral changes brought pandemic. Earlier pandemic, heard deaths vehicular accidents down, I’d imagine deaths infectious diseases also decreased side effect mask wearing. 

So, TLDR, number covid deaths ever drops amount people alive due lifestyle changes (assuming positive number), it’s entirely plausible could even excess mortality. Whether actually happened March lot suspect, would need dig data find out. 

I’m sorry long answer, hope find helpful! kind are, Cruise industry starts back up, vaccination requirement take cruise. Anecdotally, know people squarely “vaccine bad” demographic, getting shots cruise. Wonder much NL63 seropositivity there...or coronaviruses? And, bats human coronaviruses like Kenya's? thoughts exactly. point taking less risk going public getting illness. could always catch deadly virus bacterial infection going public pandemic, I'm vaccinated same. covered outdoor areas (hopefully) distanced masked.

It rich counties go Olympics rather engineer highly infectious version kills anyone can't bothered get vaccinated, guess works too.

What wrong you? don’t doubt either things true taken account hospitals reach capacity oxygen supplies run low death count increases dramatically. People could saved end dying compounds.

Some countries negotiated better contracts, it’s honestly EU way bureaucratic focusing liability clauses etc. countries didn’t get prevalence AZ felt like it, it’s better contracts. Even then, countries also got faction ordered. U.K. received around 20% supposed receive it’s like U.K. basking AZ vaccines either (despite developed U.K.).

Also healthcare is, comparison, non-existing - especially covid related stuff. One could assume overall death percentage India far surpass one US rich countries. situation crazy control seems, covid might kill multiple millions India. Twitter YouTube comments full foreign agents. completely miss point previous you’re vaccinated Awesome. I'm especially happy nations without acces way. good enough.
There needs incentives/consequences failing get vaccinated. Hybrids better environment fallacy. Incorporating hybrid tech applications ploy comply CAFE regulations.

The problem way CAFE enforced. No, article talking exactly title said, though make passing reference variolation early paragraph, mistakenly referring form vaccination. (inoculation might technically better term, still register modern non-scientific audience) case, reading beyond second paragraph, article good job explaining people get strong immune response covid vaccines that's bad thing. tried reply different comment, settle down, I've edited. did, basically light cold. Thank you. 

That’s it’s deadly. pandemic, would gone life. It’s like influenza, naturally quarantines people. extremely mild people, deadly others. Yup amazed faired well last year, expecting complete nightmare due sheer number people population density/household family mumbers. Guess held inevitable, would worked really strong vaccination rollout continued lockdown till vaccines administered I'm sure getting downvoted seems like perfectly reasonably question ask. think couple good answers:

1. vaccine less impact people's health disease, even avoid people stuck home sick week, win.
2. importantly, partially vaccinated population puts selection pressure virus mutate overcome protection given vaccine. people 60 get vaccine, stamp virus time mutate. people 60 get vaccine, virus could mutate infect vaccinated elderly, leaving us back March 2020.

I think vaccination policy challenging internalize, particularly people culture really values individualism, policy really demands community focus.  Row?
Hardly. America pay anti-science. I’m actually this. Anything get us closer herd immunity.

I’ve also planned first road trip since start pandemic; I’m headed coast buddies almost right after. 

For extra dose hopium, I’ve also F5’ing vaccination case rates San Diego across California every afternoon. Demand first-doses started dip here, 75 *%* eligible adults first shot. couldn’t imagined saying anything like back Pfizer announced efficacy rates months ago.

I don’t often like quote President Reagan, damn it, *really is* morning America. know got soap box respond whatever. I'm completely vaccinated like 6 weeks point. Anyway,

No one speak definitively long term potential side effects vaccine data available. science would heavily implicate none. me, personally, that's enough. science also indicated COVID transmissible fomites. That's really true, it? Science monolith. 

But besides that, humans monolith either. intelligent, highly educated, people medical scientific backgrounds vaccine skeptics. I'm even going address whether that's right wrong. point intelligence background determining factors right/wrong.

Telling people hesitant, skeptical, lack urgency get shot they're stupid, murderers, bad messaging, needs stop. ingratiate people want cooperate you. well summarized. terrible seeing prolong pandemic further. Even AP sensational pandemic sometimes. It’s arguably justifiable problem severe, expected AP level-headed. wish messaging political leaders CDC was: you’re vaccinated, pandemic you. 

I’m sure would make people open getting shot. I’ve heard/read people using logic “If still wear mask distance anyways, get vaccine?” Woo!  word, money.

The thing seems like people upset EU prioritising invoking ""vaccine nationalism"". legal mechanism contractual history US EU vaccine export bans different effect virtually (in fact US ban much harsher effectively extended raw materials related vaccines). people upset effect/message upset both; people upset 'legality' upset neither since well within powers rights US EU respectively. particularly appropriate example. like eating peanut butter first time allergic reaction. pretty much clear second time eat it.

They're perfect framing stories 100% time, they're reasonable. news outlets like that. think biggest failing major news agencies rarely report false things, usually bad challenging false statements guests interview.

It’s like know enough information say scary things. 🤦‍♀️ feel way people eat lots fast food junk food, never work obese seem shocked catch diabetes ailment neglect let suffer too? 

Seriously going start rationing healthcare based individuals choices behavior really need across bored all. I’m sad protected life threatening disease isn’t enough get people vaccinate. hope this’ll improve turnout get shots. used certain trans-atlantic cruises it’s bit sore subject... Why? India world's largest vaccine maker, easily make vaccines IP patent infringement. Vaccine free, fake card $20....  entire metropolitan area Sydney single case. first month.

My kid's class single case today. first school since yesterday.

I never jealous Australia. know Sporting KC KC's NWSL teams tweeted players got vaccinated. follow teams enough know missed post not. Though, know Andy Reid Patrick Mahomes did, but, know, antivaxxers love Chiefs still laugh react it.  seen India? heard this. felt really fortunate got four days first shot four second paid. pay competitive people industry feel like I'm one one million jobs I'm treated well. Rejecting reality something yet happened? even mean? I’m thinking happened Manaus. study blood donors October 2020 estimated around 76% residents gotten virus. That’s thresholds herd immunity. Nevertheless, huge wave January never able happen. Notably, cases second wave came variant. Sabino Buss wrote nice article Lancet, want evidence medical journal. 

They bring several potential alternatives explanations. A) It’s possible size first wave overestimated, smaller population immunity supposed. B) don’t know long immunity lasts - maybe January, many people caught covid early longer immune. C) variants might transmissible base covid extent herd immunity threshold would need revised significantly upwards. 

I agree probably overgeneralized: they’ve done studies shown getting base covid protects you, least extent, variants like B117. seems pretty likely me, least, doesn’t protect P1, variant found Manaus. someone sum current scientific perspective ""can vaccinated people still carry spread COVID?""

When google this/talk people seems like people say - yes, can. example, whitehouse CDC still recommends vaccinated people wear masks social distance.

This really challenges preconceived notions vaccines work purpose. taught school get vaccine protect old/young/sick get one themselves. 

So question is: scientists think ""we know yet let's air side caution"" "" yes technically rare"" actually ""yes know vaccinated people still carry spread COVID"". 

Just wanted know :) Final shot tomorrow (I’m Illinois) . I’m ready Well, certainly one precaution takers, I'm fully vaccinated, intend take reasonable precautions still start living again. vaccine brings severe hospitalization risk basically 0, even 95% effective regular infection. me, makes risk something like indoor dining even going bar worth it.

There's health balance strike. nice thing vaccine makes responsibility far individual before. Granted 100% individual, individual before. people get vaccine, but, since immunocompromised, may able mount immune response. Basically, vaccine work well them. IMO, people trying protect, catching Covid potentially make sicker well. california, businesses 25 employees required give 80 hours pandemic-related pto used vaccine-related purposes, afaik, documentation requirement flexible, said true certain cases Agreed, wanted provide links context I’m amazed people need get paid get free vaccine would save life. Meanwhile India... prove lying? prove it’s situation data knowledge changed last year?   successful Covid vaccine makers share scarce supplies making vaccine companies experience would end fewer vaccines more.

By end pandemic we'll fewer Covid vaccine makers best survive.  I’m ya 100 I'm happy get free krispy kreme donut every single day I'm going complain lol. personally know least 6 people like this, concerned getting vaccine concerned getting virus either.     me, learned world infrastructure produce vaccines rapidly, scale. Much trial, production finishing infrastructure capacity however owned privately. 

Western nations choice, sit back happy capability know needed pay price using it. Alternatively could choose build parallel capacities public utilities. Either option costs, first leaves “bad pharma” narrative play politically toxic. second inefficient waste resources probably wouldn’t survive many election cycles. third option path discussing now, rely private sector capacity choose pay use it. good idea want options future.

Southern world nations complex problem. point say go it, imagine would make lot people get vaccine. probably thousand (less 50,000 conservative) people needed games. would include athletes, coaches, support staff venues Olympic village. 

We know total people 2018 Winter Olympics paid volunteered around 50k. 

There’s good reason can’t get people vaccinated late July Olympics safe enjoyable.   I’m amazed people need get paid get free vaccine would save life. Meanwhile India... No. Also going? Traveling across country? work. Even though people aren’t traveling across country still like idea problem electric car companies face. would define consistently 1 without restrictions place across seasons. 

So yes, way know sure ahead time threshold is. Except much worse health system, even tragic. Imagine new variant would give ugly symptom, like red blotches face. bet lot people would want get vaccinated then. gotta voodoo. Consequences? draconian. want get vaccine I've developed extreme agoraphobia lockdown. get panic attacks going outside now. I'm screwed go back in-person work DAMN get one $100 EU reach 50% vaccinated end month. industry standard 1 week year, 2 weeks 2 years yeah it. gave sick days didnt.

My last job field 23 pto days 3 years plus regular holidays. exception.  reasoning case atleast right now. SII's CEO openly advocated foreign vaccines multiple times, advocated steps taken approve foreign vaccines.

Further, make lot sense give bribes, right atleast. SII bharat biotech asking funds expand production months, government approved late 15th April. demand products always high. Instead bribing government, could directed funds make profit. fact 3000 crore rs grant SII delayed, shows SII government really phase. Government even publically threatened SII procure SII's vaccines forcefully. either herd immunity now, term actually meaningless.

part equation also vax%

(arguably important herd immunity: know?

However, recent conceptual developments vaccine 'herd immunity' 'herd protection' address complexities imperfect immunity, heterogeneous populations, nonrandom vaccine uptake 'freeloaders'. vaccines may provide better protection others; instance, meningococcal conjugate vaccines superior polysaccharide vaccines, true pneumococcal Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines. **Achieving high uptake rate target certain vaccines, example, measles vaccine, order prevent disease effectively**. Emerging issues, example, waning immunity pertussis vaccination, fresh challenges.

I live Texas, people care masks social distancing. care ""freedums"". people find excuse need ""their rights"".

I know probably get downvoted typing this, times like maybe people forced take vaccines even want to. People things sense justice duty. People bad things know get away it. Taking vaccines different.

Wow, really walk everyone line fire.... tiny incentives work mindless humans. slap face! Moderna gang 😤💪🏼 Love this! agree you, hinting (and explain enough comment) time infection death. widespread reports cases killing people, N440K going infection death 3-4 days, much shorter 10-15 days typical strains Covid. effectively means infected person alive spreading virus much shorter amount time, hence decreasing transmission. I'd guess something like masks nail salon workers wear.  sense humor lol course got mine well  expectation developing countries turn patent usable, safe trustworthy vaccine stretch. Particularly quickly countries need vaccine. Giving employees time get vaccine enough imho. believe Canadians want shot reach 70 percent .

No, going random people asking medical history ok. fucking weirdos. Jesus. guess I'm real shitty parent taking two-year old grocery store. Thats well good even degenerate gambler puts money mouth fuckers want put money mouth could also lag (Indian cases exploding deaths following weeks behind) demographics (younger populations fewer deaths per case). Probably points true, though. Copied another thread topic:

USA: what? companies spent billions research development...

world: also want send best human experts well, send too. want tech know pandemic pharmaceutical industry compete with. political posturing point Canadians wait 4 months 2nd dose due Trudeau's failed vaccine rollout. 

This hilarious - one hand arguing open enough people single dose, hand blame JT for... going single dose.

Which bullshit patisan hackery, absolutely incorrect NACI made recommendation *provinces* make choices distribute. QC much higher percentage people single shot - went model well province.

Get political bullshit outta here. need panic N440K right. expressing disbelief massive downvotes concerned dad. think there's anything wrong plan do, example. wish kids could vaccinated soon too. kids home entire time super tiring. Yeah literally thing happened 2 months ago first dose, sometimes wonder experts make claims. 

Of course, lower give time probably increase. Hopefully data, now, literally sufficient make statement one way other. world bigger USA Europe. rest world, lockdown recession set back efforts promote birth control fight child marriage many years. mean massive population growth areas least able cope it. real numbers almost certainly much dire that. honestly struggle comprehend amount misery death India right now. Well reason antivax lying symptoms?

I got Pfizer woke 3 chills bad couldn’t get up. went away within hours. bad it’s best transparent people. Feeling like absolute shit second dose common. It’s much easier this. fire anyone doesn’t submit proof vaccination (or legitimate medical exemption) HR. pretty similar reaction family members well. Nothing first dose achy tired 2nd. first vaccine dose USA Dec 14 2020 IIRC. let’s start there. 

Since then, US ~ 274,000 covid deaths Canada ~ 10,760 covid deaths. 

Thats 834 deaths per million US 286 deaths per million Canada. 

I know country would say botched handling.  indication trials.  dad going get church earlier week decided moving didn’t want potentially laid bed still lot do. 

I’m going see he’ll go get second one next week.  terrible failing US pandemic response. opened non-essential businesses schools. Schools first thing reopen (masks required). If, reopening schools month, things looked okay, **then** started reopen businesses.  puzzling random is. second Pfizer gave bad headache night shot serious pain injection shot. Otherwise nothing. Good point sample size several hundred thousands actually contain lot gravity background data complete 1/1 resolution. different almost datasets pop data extrapolated. actually quite ""enormous"" study even though dataset narrower width. danish health data sought even though total pop 5.8 million.

Though course data would always better, mentioned Germany already several papers aligning research: Per CDC, flu dangerous covid children. risk complications healthy children higher flu compared children die flu typical year died covid past year. outlook great, demand falling drastically last couple weeks 44% people vaccinated least one dose.  Floridian, best conspiracy I've seen far.

Guess I'm ghost now.  think need know vaccine had... Pfizer (BioNtech) Moderna sinovac others. cold impact efficacy vaccine?

got monday, felt sluggish tuesday, congested wednesday, woke full head cold today BioNTech relatively small company 1000 employees pre-Covid revenue 120 Million Euros. took big risk putting much effort vaccine development course deserve good compensation that. course you(or government behalf you) need pay vaccine, else think kind developments financed?

These guys gigantic service human kind discovering vaccine fast, luckily capitalist system rewards incredible efforts accordingly. cr...

Let try again, bul...s.. 

Wait, got time, factually inaccurate. reading comprehension impress, considering exclusively mentioned outdoors. think ineffective indoors? hahahaha Seriously? Vaccinated people carriers. That's whole point article. I'm saying vaccinated people continue shut in, dad expresses concern yet vaccinated kids gets massively downvoted, feels unnecessarily callous. reaction first shot worse second. brother RA reaction first 2nd. Pfizer. point everyone’s body reacts differently. Don’t afraid get second shot Original strain long gone. Technically hospitals already employees refuse flu vaccine. make refuse shot wear mask flu season. get shot don’t mask hospital. food thought. perspective: live Philippines country requires masks, face shields too. found without either one, get fined. also guards hired walk around malls yell standing close anyone else, yes, even family member significant other.

We've strictest lockdown measures world due lack contact tracing, mass testing extremely slow rollout vaccines, cases higher ever ""beloved"" President spews word vomit every couple days people die starvation COVID. would waiting 3 years vaccine. state rights... flu colds dangerous kids covid is. see point. Canadians chomping bit get vaccine. I’m honestly #1. covid January research I’m finding shows robust protection least 6-7 months. similar vaccine. I’m young strong immune response. I’m less likely get covid do, it’s likely asymptomatic thus lower viral load less likely spread others. exactly vaccine intended do, don’t see also get vaccine. 

Now next year variants escape immunity start seeing true increase reinfection, I’d get updated vaccine. depends effectiveness single dose preventing infection. effectiveness single dose preventing infection less 30%, single dose much different vaccine all, prioritizing second dose would better job slowing spread. think start publish stats. Starting couple weeks pretty much people die could got vaccine wanted it. 

There good chance 95+% deaths come vaccinated all. would decent stat illustrate important vaccination is. 

Like 600 people died today. 570 vaccinated, 25 one dose 5 fully vaccinated. 

As example. least make mind whether

“ reason border opened even 1 dose”

Or 

“ high % percentage 1st doses 2nd doses matter.” you’re unmasked inside public you’re piece shit deserve get questioned. anyone know possible get second dose France first one done United States? (Pfizer) instruction this? recently move receiving second dose, plan travel back US second? see American travel europe UK summer?  seems like good strategy. Sweden seem expand priority groups empty vaccination centers day. Look map come back tell us countries higher population growth rates higher quality life. ever look number people also already covid. Generally covid contributes herd immunity well. younger healthier populations. Kids though. choice. actually different codes. able find exact information, articles read, totally different ARN sequence lipid cover also different allows storing higher temperatures. would like know too, look like there's public data it. logical assumption would almost deaths 0 vaccines, recently got first dose, rare edge cases deaths fully vaccinated people.

You also need consider 45% people even gotten first shot, there's tons fully unvaccinated people there, who've hospital long time. saying nothing fear. I? Learn read. lower Covid death rate per capita (both historically currently), US Europe plan keep way.

But Canada's Covid death rate per capita nearly 20x South Korea, Canadians continue travel here, even breaking quarantine. $200 utterly ridiculous. made right call. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Economist link, see several companies say they're ready produce adenovirus vaccines. Those're different mRNA vaccines Derek Lowe mostly talking about. (Perhaps Derek could've specific.) Also, AstraZeneca already licensed technology lot companies, I'm wondering manufacturers talked them?

Also, see several companies saying they're ready produce mRNA vaccines ""if provided know-how."" First, I'm wondering needed machines, know short supply. even do, Derek says, ""Moderna, one, said limiting factor tech-transfer efforts simply enough trained people go around."" That's another real constraint.

So, thanks detailed links, still agree Derek's argument, especially around mRNA vaccines. quote news article unclear. make sound like returned traveller caught virus quarantine. fault! pressure Biden free patents really European control?

OK, maybe tattoo forehead. least vaccine passport! well serbia USA dont rights Ah, misread comment above. thought meant guy left quarantine **then** tested positive. Pfizer parents Moderna, dad boat me, however mom felt crappy day AZ serum shipped EU months. one point, majority EU’s AZ doses came serum produced America.  I’m aware low rate testing one would think many deaths would hard sweep rug, especially considering excess mortality rate Japan last year. However, haven’t seen excess mortality rate first half 2021 yet. tested positive day 1 quarantine. definitely acquired get vaccine (talking 2nd dose waiting two weeks 2nd dose)? finished second dose three weeks ago I'm still scared hear words like 'mutant variants' possible contagious coronavirus variants works. live life normal now? 


Also, I'm allowed second question, heard 70% population needs vaccinated get country back normal. include teens kids getting vaccinated opening vaccination too? Japan little testing quite awhile pandemic. remember lot reports middle 2020 undercounting deaths, lot deaths officially pneumonia flu likely covid.

But agree I'm surprised undercounted deaths factor 10. COVID happily part that’s company wanting to. many companies mandate regardless FDA approval. really tired day second shot, never felt sick. really tired. Two week post shot feel fine. Agree I’ll mention Germany capitalist system drug development too. Correct I’m wrong, don’t think Biontech government venture.

I understand righteous indignation see social media anything related healthcare costs system USA broken. Like though, technology innovation moves faster capitalist system. mRNA vaccines validation that.  waste money nearly aggressive enough. Pay people $1000 get vaccinated, $2000, that's still drop bucket taxpayer money used cope pandemic. Low testing.  That's shown markeing ploy. public worried differences vaccines available? specific vaccine type vaccine better others, public use information planning vaccination appointments? vaccine card bedroom desk, doesn’t fit wallet don’t want get bent damaged purse. thing I’ve used making photocopy give employer, would give $100 incentive.  flat week, start decline bit 7 day average people going death us all.

So, crazy 36 hours people L.A.

Sometimes think social media death humanity. way Access covid patents get facilities making covid vaccines, get people access covid vaccines.... 2024.  question vax tiers.

Those 65 older included first tier make 70% deaths.

However, 50-64 - 20% CA C19 deaths - last tier opened everyone.

What's science behind decision make millions people high ICU risk wait behind millions people lower ICU risk?

Are studies point would back decision?

-----
To put another way:

- make 1 million people aged 18-29 wait 1 month doses, certain number die waiting. Call number ""LOW"".
- Now, calculation aged 50-64. Call number ""HIGH"".

Isn't ""HIGH"" higher ""LOW""?

(Note 50-64 20% CA C19 deaths, 18-29 0.5% CA C19 deaths.)

You'll frequently hear young/healthy ""essential workers"" ""high risk"", different risks. They're high infection risk, they're low ICU/death risk.

Some also say goal vaxing young/healthy seniors/high risk limit ""spread"". Yet, doses, real danger spread spread to. spread someone young/healthy, might even notice getting C19. spread senior, might die. Vaxing ICU risk would make worries spread less issue.

Some also say OK make seniors wait doses continue take precautions. Yet, death stats show, many weren't. Lawful neutral I’m surprised Japan. manage hide almost 100,000 Covid deaths, ten times reported? fairness, yes, anecdotally sooner get vaccinated prior recovering COVID likely side effects related vaccine. providers hospital advising waiting 90 days side effects bad certainly dangerous get vaccine sooner. Natural immunity quite protective within 90 day window providers work see point pushing vaccination prior that. People who've subsidized billions dollars, made billions dollars, want make many billions possible. news 10!  Accurate latests CDC numbers, count probable cases (pneumonia etc) correlated excess deaths. Belgium. Hopefully June maybe end May get waiting list call  Well incentive free shot ok promising it’s free next years. safely assume annual shot move choice like flu shot friend mine 20's, smart guy, pro-science discussing things nature. Saw recently asked got shot yet said no, he's sluggish front. reasons like ""I wanna wait see"" anything like that, he's lazy.

Never discount power laziness procrastination. 

That said, think makes sense pop-up vaccination sites major local event, every sports stadium booth pop walk-up shot. explain difference mRNA vaccines vs traditional ones, well explain quick develop may skeptical? demand low, supply hard come given logistics vaccines. 

I bet hard get around live month two. don’t mean rude, rather genuinely curious would like understand, makes afraid vaccine? look states like California, one vaccinated states, it’s clear vaccine actually works improving situation. makes hesitant? well, federal government ultimate authority ships sail ports, cant go real cruise right now, appeasing cdc mandatory vaccinations basically way get order lifted humans 60% similar bananas.

Even European counties high testing rates eventually lockdwon impose restrictions. Obviously get 2nd dose. 

However, misleading. course immunity day get first dose. Even first dose effective, need allow time immunity build. 

This lumps anybody tested positive first dose, even tested positive next day. 

To truly test effectiveness first dose, look data happens 3 weeks first dose administered. Including data first 3 weeks fair comparison makes point frankly pointless. baby debt eyes. Ignorant? Tell 401k morning stocks/etf pharma pharma suppy chain. means transfer wealth developing country billionaires. Oh course. I’m happy gotten vaccinated. sincerely thought wouldn’t vaccinated due world. I’m simply stating would’ve loved received mRNA vaccine like friends live Europe North America got chance to. 

But agree you, take first vaccine you’re offered. vaccine better vaccine. I’m aware risks blood-clots AZ still low enough make good enough. ""fuck em"" let part society develop immunity naturally. kids never worried health past year clear infinitesimal risk. son learning drive, worried every risk I'd never let get car.  word P.1 variant?

That's one doomer life ks currently worried about, seen studies original mRNA vaccine formulas (Pfizer/Moderna) Taxing ultra rich won’t diminish economic engine way. hoarding wealth. 

This sounds lot like trickle economics. Coupon 50% Guac, best do. one dumbest conspiracy theories I've ever heard.  Glad know think little lives lost... They're statistics, huh? unblinded Astrazeneca trial, vaccine! Feeling relieved means need another 2 jabs, would I'd control vaccine! Wife also vaccinated front line worker. Super happy! worries me. grand experiment children. made sense early given risk covid risk dramatically falling due vaccinations. 

We idea years masking, distancing, remote learning, fear disease young children. 

I'm saying things instantly go back normal making quick tangible progress toward returning normalcy children. vaccines developed tax payers money via public institutions (Oxford, UPenn, etc.) patents belong institutions.  not? reduce spread symptoms much more, tweak vaccine switch production - keep everyone much safer, end things faster, save lives.

There's literally zero reason to.  Ever hear little thing called federalism? mean rate Michigan never getting 70% coverage yeah, problem. Earlier: ‘ Kids don’t spread virus.’ 
Later: ‘Kids key stopping spread’
This reduces trust science. ‘we don’t know’ ok answer give early on. prevents erosion trust. first months critical botched badly imagined previous administration. also health officials... Fauci's early statements age well.

We never know fully functioning federal government would done course pandemic agree would better happened. Least surprising Nobel prizes ever. they? forget 0. former Dr. Andrew Wakefield (may rot hell).  1. Vaccine approval processes took *really* long time back then, like Covid vaccines would allowed fast track testing. would seek approval, set phase 1 testing, analyze results, seek approval, set phase 2, like every pharma company existence. speed Covid-19 vaccine development largely part due parallel testing fast tracked approval processes (they basically skipped queues got everything once).

2. come vaccine it, able manufacture already created approved design main issue would infrastructure yes, take while, comparatively short lot processes this. Especially compared estimates full worldwide covid vaccination could possibly take 2024-2025.  problem rule added would make already US-centered sub already US-centered, vast majority data trackers non-US countries provided balance subreddit. fine, see think high quality enough.

But reality daily US data tracker practice allowed, others not, supposed international subreddit.

**I totally fine US vaccine tracker, allowed, similar updates parts world allowed well** People dying massively outside hospitals happened richest countries world. average, across whole country whole pandemic, India done way better many countries. video bad situation specific time place going change statistics say.  USA PLEASE COME BRAZIL internet full trolls, foreign agents, kids acting like know they’re talking about. medical advice, legal advice, important news, trust well-established accountable news sources, social media comments sketchy news sites.

And importantly, ignore attempts derail saying trustworthy accountable news sources. Indeed is, especially public schools. (the teen vaccination) think better question not?

Even Moderna 80% asymptomatic infection variant X, update 95% possible?


I think bigger reason simple: hear tons variants, variants concern share mutations common. update vaccine cover once, we're better protected current theoretically likely future variants.

Sure, mutations happen ways expect ways seen yet, numbers odds. might itch? *robust protection* would got least 1 shot 2-shot vaccine. otherwise taking chances. single shot least, Ab &amp; t-cell levels would charts. studied detail LaJolla institute. England they're actually recommending least one shot previously infected, partially order first doses available people, supply provide second doses people. It’s still hard get I’m sorts computer access. drive hour live suburbs. Got second shot 3rd. Definitely feel hopeful since pandemic began. Going vacation June too! Finally. mother russia, dont take vaccine. Vaccine takes you. 

/S I'm you. feel like I'm punished proactive signing shot minute eligible. life changed waited weeks. know beer, principle! Rewarding procrastinators. Although understand would hard run - what's stop people going places multiple times vacc card, since understanding May people get beer ""voucher"" sorts... True - suspect measures mitigate transmission place gone then. still huge pool people get sick. grandmother got right Christmas friend went aunt's infected 7 people. went downhill sadly get vaccine since really available public yet. sucks would could grandmother could gotten vaccine time. countries regulate export goods across borders. may also provisions allowing seizure property private entity national interest. I'm solely wearing mask required, thats polite human thing do. second anymore I'm done (unless feel sick something else) It’s pretty pathetic time, it’s better throw date move pick June somethingth move back. 

If look Israel’s case rate, early March early April went 407 cases per million 48% population vaccination coverage 33 cases per million 56%. 

Massachusetts 49% vaccination coverage yesterday/today, 153 cases per million. expect Covid cases mass order 12-20 per million June 7th. That’s low enough warrant opening everything up. What's non-medical disposable mask? Still said nothing though Talk empty paragraph..... 

Perhaps you’re knowledgable industry think “empty”. Tl;dr People illogical convictions sell reliably cheaply given chance.  would even matter spread herd immunity vulnerable populations?

That... herd immunity works friend. Unless 60+ population entirely segregated rest population, we're part herd. 

The concept herd immunity enough people immune virus virus cannot spread population. Herd immunity effectively lowers R value virus point burn out, instead spreading around us. 

Think way, vaccine that's 80% effective preventing infection disease, population vaccinated disease raging, 1 5 chance catching it.

BUT vaccine 80% effective preventing infection, even someone disease comes population, able spread herd immunity, chance catching virus almost 0, never run someone virus.

Herd immunity exactly that, HERD immune infection reduced ability virus transmit within herd. cannot claim herd immunity subset population, work. actually higher that. like 4 1 000 000 (or 1 125 000) seems increasing young people vaccinated.  


You're cherry picking stats. 70 year old higher chance dying covid low chance getting blood clots. risk change younger person eventually flip get 30s territory risks getting blood clot AZ vaccine higher dying Covid. 


It's get vaccine covid. choice vaccine none all. choice get vaccine get slightly later access preferred one. Generalising anyone favors. Younger people aware risk make cost/benefit assessment based situation, especially areas older people already vaccinated anyway. good you, serious. everyone US wants vaccine gotten getting it. They're probably also smart enough people theyre getting vaccinated putting significant risk then. 

&amp;#x200B;

You erasing people's race, culture, ethnicity, history, putting words mouths. India testing small fraction infected, recording small fraction resultant deaths Covid related. parts country, excess death rate exceeding state reports Covid deaths 30 fold.

At moment, there's really reliable statistics either cases Covid deaths coming India. Perhaps months wave passes, counts statistically excess deaths, Indian states keep better records. waste money. Governments scientists fully given idea could get herd immunity push covid cases low enough shots arent needed anymore. people dont want get vaccinated, thats lives family. Meanwhile people vaccinated statistically fine going public without mask.

If people choosing risk getting severely ill possible death, let suffer consequences. reason people sanity foot billions cost pay get vaccinated. Sure US sending it. according post, CEO claims Covishield production impacted ban. instead Novovax equivalent yet approved anywhere. surprised deflection given death threats pressure Meanwhile, Good Ol' Moron14 got vaccine right time need 100$ incentive right thing...

Where's 100$. motivated wanting catch virus potentially spread people. 

Might want stop yelling people still spread virus getting vaccinated, I've heard way many people use excuse. also surprising many people around world acting surprised what's happening there.

Given virus caused widespread infection huge death tolls (relative population) rich countries healthcare well-funded people afford work home socially distance, remotely surprised happened places like India Brazil. Especially when, said, predicted start pandemic.

Based UK stats, people younger age groups blood clots age groups 50+ despite younger groups vaccinated huge numbers yet.  


It's incredibly rare. fairly rare data incomplete occurrence rate increases age decreases. 2 weeks ago, UK data suggested risk 1 125 000 (ignoring age vaccinated people). April 28, numbers lowered 1 93 000 (as age vaccinated people starts get lower). possible it'll get even lower go move towards lower age groups. also important note could potential lag reporting problems blood clots show late 20-25 days vaccine given.  


Personal circumstances ignored either change risk/benefits ratio significantly. healthy 31 year low risk area old, works home continue willing wait 1 2 months another vaccine better waiting risk catching covid-19 getting hospitalized lower shared house people worked shop. lower risk catching covid-19 getting hospitalised means blood clot risk may far greater personal circumstances. 19 year old India may benefit greatly getting AZ vaccine despite risks associated risks Covid circumstances far outweigh risk blood clots.

Inb4 start walking back saying, ""We MeAnT SpAnIsH FlU!"" One thing I'm curious quickly vaccine efficacy ramps up. know glean much studies full efficacy considered two weeks complete series, models say anything process? Like expect really quick ramp full efficacy, spread two weeks? pandemic started wore mask wherever went, cautious worried soon places started demand masks threw mine out.

This childish shit I've ever heard. Jesus fucking christ... doesn’t 99.98% survival rate 
Source: CDC still infected contagious, much less likely. CDC national governments cannot fully transparent population average zero scientific understanding willingness think critically. company gives $150 get vaccinated. Can't get point unless try. Obesity isn’t genetic, it’s caused choices. seeing app. talking mobile website? OK, vaccine maybe kind mystery long-term (although there's indication would cause long-term effects, digress...)

We know COVID long-term effects even asymptomatic. know COVID long-term physical mental development children. *are* indications something quite bad come COVID infection long-term.

So getting vaccinated way hedge bet? issue “we need solid evidence tons studies say vaccines reduce transmission extra sure” line thinking none cautious thinking used justify implementing NPI’s. 

I’m saying things don’t work, public health authorities never said “well don’t absolute evidence whether lockdowns masks curfews whatever reduce transmission, can’t say sure do”. 

These measures implemented stated fact based modeling laboratory studies showed interventions reduce transmission. 

We laboratory studies real world evidence vaccines reduce transmission, still conversation around whether vaccinated people still transmit large scale. 

Basically point is, vaccines held extremely high standard terms judging effectiveness limiting spread public health authorities interventions weren’t?   Free (or incentivized) preventative medicine win! mean say much harmed epidemic. Must nice american   sorry bro. get vaccinated means get free krispy kreme donut  all. know unsafe, *really* want Olympics anyway. mean get it, they've hyping since 2019, it' big deal, etc. etc. damn, like watching slow motion trainwreck. terrible decision terrible decision. been?! still restrictions place... We're cultivating mass here.  invisible marketing ploy. Congrats offering right thing  think look mRNA vaccines work...  Wait second... spreading technology would inhibit development? That's exactly opposite things work. 

Not mention referring countries here. ones benefitted companies. I’m guessing glass half empty know vaccinated people spread virus, definitively know can't. disproven assumed possible.

This contrary know vaccines viruses general. vaccine trains immune system fight virus spread body can't shed it.

But possibilities. Like virus could get body place immune system can't fight it, like stuck mucous membranes hair, could shed way. evidence happens theoretically possible.

[There case someone fully vaccinated measles gave 4 people, 2 vaccinated. studied found vaccine defenses waned somehow. one isolated case.

[There study showed animals vaccinated whooping cough could still transmit others.

So precedent it. hand numerous real-world studies including CDC Israel show significantly reduced spread areas vaccinated. guess whatever reason studies convincing certain officials. Sounds reasonable!  Congrats new job.  I'm sure understand saying. saying Moderna Pfizer/Biontech ramping production faster last year? totally agree that.

And, far know, Moderna Pfizer/Biontech contracting manufacturers make vaccines - know otherwise, please let know; I'd surprised.   get wrong, I'm grateful, frustrating areas dropping restrictions us got vaccinated. wanted get vaccinated start with, main spiel convince coworkers faster return normal. upset pace, feel duped.  hurting efforts trying get last get vaccine. Thankfully Wolfe Murphy started make progress. MA, would never able convince get it, pay them. think die get seriously ill. pay want less restrictions. table, continue get vaccinated. sticks necessary. We're track 70% adults July. Everything going fine.

Maybe let's let last volunteers finish getting see works start talking coercion. Offer money yes. know it’s pathetic, person earth, want get protected help end vaccinate myself. would love see fast everyone would get vaccinated moneys involved. 

This country makes sad daily basis. take solace everyone know love vaccinated see amount demand vaccines plummeting oof. continue ""feel"" way many organizations, countries, Nobel laurates, scientists, saying would faster. would've already faster followed CTAP plan last year. 

It seems like siding industry lobbyists part. find case biased? welcome go look yourself. tied % vaccinated certain date. think mask mandates regardless % vaccinated dropped point summer. known yet much vaccine someone already covid needs? People seem going back forth one dose two previously infected. specific Russia, global politics whole.

Don’t worry, don’t find scary all. think Bill Maher said best. One side came pretended like nothing, opposite side come pretend like World War Z.

I'd also argue system place able transport people ICU's space example failsafes place help manage hard-to-manage situation.

You seem impression making argument regards lockdowns is... Odd, made argument. 

Again, question relativity. want bring bunch bad news, ignore news everywhere else world, pretend live vacuum, easy conclude Canada badly managing worst public health crisis lifetimes. worldwide scale, ""ICU's provinces got really high non COVID related surgeries pushed"" really bad compared peers actually *way* people die virus, often put healthcare workers position lives dies, mostly much away end nightmare due behind us vaccinations.

To clear since lot responders seem understanding part, *I saying high ICU numbers pushing surgeries bad. bad. Pandemics bad. real pandemic. Bad things happened happen.*

But mentioned first comment, relativity thing. want measure country responded crisis, imperative compare country responses results peers, instead comparing imagination hopes wish things would gone. Cancel move somewhere virus control. becoming ridiculous. super-powered guardians DOOM Source? far know, Indian law give patent protection lifesaving product. inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine made India Bharat BioTech, currently production three firms.

One wealthiest educated towns country voted extend outdoor mandate end month since ""many residents ready see people without masks"". population getting overrepresented input discussion. Ah fuck it, got me.

No, mask work 100%. like birth control. 2 weeks UFC 261 surge! /s I'm really get strong conspiracy vibes tbh, got reliable sources there?

The 'source' corn fact developing corn plants produce antibodies, including attack sperm form male contraception. interesting read deliberately misinterpreted here.

Really hoping least last paragraph might satire, holding onto much faith. one dose, that’s key point someone confusing India Indiana maybe? need turn shipments, ship Canada, need got spare. feel like theme parks safer places go. They're largely outside long crowds shoulder shoulder they're probably fine. Rides enclosed spaces they're enclosed spaces moving particles hanging air forever wear mask well. still wear mask distance + washing hands safe even 100% vaccine still spread virus ?

78% Americans 18. That, coupled fact 16 17-year-olds also eligible Pfizer expects approval vaccine 12-to-15-year-olds coming days, would day do, fact, pretty adequate amount ""wiggle room."" calculate fatality number positives deaths

India 1,1% 
US 1,8%
Brazil 2,8%
UK 2,9%
Italy 3,9%  pointless comparison know reported numbers wildly incorrect. also would even matter spread herd immunity vulnerable populations? aim high vaccination rate 60+ take issue use term *carrot*, implies type vaccine-hesitant person donkey. experience, donkeys much intelligent compassionate. That's bummer situation makes lot sense. Best regards parents countless people similar situation. 

My overall expectation cases/hospitalizations/positivity rates plummet soon, slow-moving intelligentsia finally stop absurdly cautious, reopenings elsewhere meaningful downsides, collectively get things thoroughly. course solve situations like discussed, hopefully puts Boston good spot medium term.

My selfish ""let's ridiculously cautious here"" concern I'm starting MBA one Cambridge schools late August. expect vaccination requirement students, community large ridiculously high vaccination rate. school still make us wear masks class, large community events, generally annoying things? expectations unfortunately low even though theoretically absolute pinnacle rationality. lot different reasons:

- im young and/or healthy, need it

- overblown

- already it, im fine

- want pay (many dont know free)

- plot microchip us

- Tuskegee airmen

- im waiting full approval good point. PhDs pharma companies academia companies know.what goes places. likely die driving store getting serious covid fully vaccinated individual. Say find batches 2,345 2,456 less effective. could make announcement people need booster repeat second dose. Yay!  Restaurant mean ""under control""? Logarithmic growth longer possible hospitals can't overrun (barring obscene mutations). Outside continuing play safe bit longer, seems like we're mostly woods. Masks don’t work? absurd. can’t believe countries allowed market dedicate vaccine rollout happen. 

Canada resources make vaccine. mRNA ones apparently easy make right equipment, equipment many labs already of. 

Why earth countries taken control production distribution? It’s damning indictment entire economic system wait private companies it. Companies btw used loads government money research vaccine technologies. know kids. They're fine. makes people feel better without things actually help hurtful economy like lockdowns, social distancing requirements capacity limits etc. That's works. They’re basically waiting long term efficacy data come point. 

We already know mRNA vaccines crazy safe. rare people issues seem people severe allergies things. 

IMHO, it’s worth it. feels good start return normal. 

Only downside evening bang antibodies. low fever bit, miss work. unlikely, saying people 60 vulnerable telling whole story. Rent's due local landchad party doesn’t stop there!

Who’s ready Sputnik Light Lime? definitely different feel Chicago weekend felt great. absolutely amazing weather hurt, also nice see smiling faces again. Chicago summers always incredible, summer 2021 going one remember forever! insult retail work. 

From anecdotal interactions - sure seem like everyone else knows pharma industry do, even working long. really depends work. imagine teachers daycares going want keep mask mandates workplace kids eligible vaccine. probably last group ditches mask, ever do. healthcare. People would riot (in extremely large numbers)if allowed carry religious practices . Lifting IP obviously help thanks removing legal concerns often extremely high licensing costs. 

An expert given industry / field usually extract process information patents fill gaps experience. pay 1/4th ambulance ride get covid. Right??? I’m sure dumb horrible. Thank you! Thank you! wouldn’t make sense regardless Federalism thing not. 

The US big country shouldn’t holding one area country another bad. vaccine data seems 60% eligible population vacinated, Thats closer 40% entire population.

In America, 60% 16+ population would put us 48%. Thats enough cases drop natural immunity here. already seeing  already done safety trials. need order get full approval show long vaccine lasts. unlikely vaccine cause long-term side effects yet discovered, contents vaccine stay system short amount time, side effects usually either occur directly shot days weeks following it. different types drugs, stay body much longer.

I think option get vaccinated, get vaccinated. Even worried getting majorly sick yourself, faster vaccinate everyone, earlier go back normal. see source that? I'm curious Found bhakt. people 30s 40s unlikely die, long term effects disease. Insulting retail work isn’t good look, dude. Absolutely worthless  time temp late. Well, couple things address here, starters, US changed much specific regard honest. there's ever time history country would given vaccines getting majority citizens home country. say perception country changed much though, wrong PR messages polished used be.

Two, absolutely stabilize things begin aiding countries effectual capacity. plane depressurizes, always tell put mask first trying help others, easy let self slip unconsciousness could help anyone else successfully. thing here, unfortunately citizens US willing responsible, honestly one holiday large even away similar death spiral India, gotten good handle things trying help everyone else, things could gotten bad enough logistics broke down, one would get vaccines, they'd spoil freezers production could potentially stop, there's would three biggest manufacturers world commission.


Then finally, situation largely unprecedented, humans tribal nature. unknown, protect own. Or, accurately, ""NZ temporarily paused travel NSW account 2 cases detected Sydney"". articles dumb. I’m 98% sure caught covid wearing mask, traced every place went days testing positive, wearing mask everywhere. basically grocery store errands. 

NYC rest northeast near universal mask use, still thousands cases per day. Masks help, never going get us pandemic. things worked vaccines, military-esque lockdown orders, closing borders, aggressive contact tracing, proof negative testing go public. much hope hearing unfortunately didn’t see improvements getting vaccinated. 

Happy do, though! relief must vaccinated feeling bit better. India refusing approve vaccine without locally conducted phase 3 trial? YouTube channel TV channel video recorded TV channel posted. Yes, one central channels. presenter beginning retells news German newspapers person vaccinated, infected covid infected others. screen, see images newspapers quotes. literally 1 minute ""interesting news germany"" - one might say so. suppose question reliability asked German newspapers published information. rest video focuses spread covid dangers. indicated yes, be. effectiveness vaccine estimated 95%, means 5% percent may contamination.

[From date 62.2% population fully April 12, 59% doses administered Sinopharm vaccines rest Covishield, version AstraZeneca Plc’s shot made license two thirds [current cases] either unvaccinated one dose, rest two doses, said.

It reported AstraZeneca lower efficiency South African variant (most likely behind Seychelles spread), there's much data Sinopharm variants. probably main reason Seychelles spread.

Even going companies, organizing full list companies pay stubs valid going huge pain. Think many small grocery stores convenience stores around, instance, would covered this. go 'Lets cover big companies employees', that's hugely unfair small businesses people work them.  


Also, easy fake pay stubs (if route went)? Especially (necessarily) opening employees hundreds different organizations.

Who responsible actually checking whether valid not, kind training going give people determine that? 

How organize said training presumably tens thousands people running vaccination sites across country? 

How much time, effort, money process waste, could going towards vaccination effort, healthcare services? 

Do bother checking, let people blatantly cheat? fair?  


I'm sure would possible come system works, effort, really think trivial people claim. confirm friend tell paid 1k dollar value get in...think cover charge going hospital.... Hopefully they're looking data Chile Seychelles. Covid likely diminish own, like Spanish Flu did, regardless whether people get vaccinated. South Africa's cases dropped substantially despite less 3% population vaccinated. think bit I'm certain baby boom. baby bust. WW2 housing education affordable ever, they've gotten expensive pandemic. Rather decreasing inequality like WW2, crisis increased it, fertility taking beating result. lack new long-term relationships formed pandemic probably also slightly depress birth rates years. Gonna hope willing give exemptions situation demands it

Hardly seems fair throw someone society unable vaccine (like myself) acting like sometimes wearing mask somehow worse wearing mask all.

Not worse, better mask people around wearing one still offers protection.

Not really. true thought Covid spread droplets, know airborne/aerosol spread there's really partial protection wearing mask sometimes. CureVac already fridge temperature mRNA vaccine.

None less, waiving IP rights enable produce them... eventually. fast enough? waive rights, companies start developing manufacturing process. able deliver doses year? kind knowledge transfer system would probably more, requiring companies affordably license production anyone also provide training knowledge transfer part arrangement.

Fundamentally, reason Moderna producing Moderna vaccine inspite saying enforce IP rights. bigbrain something even better.  Obviously latter. analysts saying India could undercounting deaths factor 4. places already fully re-opened. go gyms, bars, restaurants etc.

Like even possible?  Anyone gotten vaccine gotten covid? know friend vaccine everyone house got except him. Despite media fear-mongerers say, people want vaccine. last numbers heard said 78% Americans wanted vaccine, past threshold herd immunity. agreed. i’m fully faxed too. Nice clickbait title. want ppl continue sad? masochist something? it’s proven actually listen science, saves lives. protein code. code work differently ingredients vaccine? Super fascinated science here. you’re asking ppl already sacrificed much stay indoors keep wearing masks. I’m sorry i’m fully vaccinated. want go back long walks hanging uncle. even getting vaccine even though believes conspiracy theories doesn’t trust government.

my brother getting vaccinated well.  you’re asking ppl keep living disruptive lives children get vaccinated? 
it’s going happen. horrible report! fuck CNN trying monetize misery others? Imagine showing American dying like this.

Disgusting people. numbers hand, even say Indian strains much less virulent others. fret? media fret flagging variant storyline?  mean, obvious US EU waited regions vaccines ensured better nothing. like us Spain scheduled mine end next year, that’s right end 2022 way means US right stick costs one select group people unlike popular belief mainly wealthy. cost pandemic shared equally citizens.  One look numbers 2 different viewpoints:

a) likely grossly underreported.

b) proportionally Germany roughly number deaths today. 250 reported here, India roughly 17x population, two numbers roughly even(250x17 ≈ 4k India).
The applies also numbers infections total 21953 (Germany) x 17 ≈ 400k India. think drop birthrates correlated decreased sexual partners/experiences. think people magically got better using OCP's condoms pandemic.  heard someone say mean ""science"" saying. I'd say headline couple months premature.

Yes, vaccinations increasing daily infection cases decreasing.

But vax rate peaked significant decline. infection rate decreasing slowly still higher since beginning surge. every month hear new variant worse original.

The fat lady sung yet. might.  Really SEC's season since that's anti-vaxxers seem be. May Day holiday news even best proof. tourist boom already happened last October Chinese Nation Day holidays. Check videos:

[Millions travel National Day opens ‘golden week’, China’s first big holiday since Covid-19 - Night Walk China National Day|Police Walls Control Traffic - Bund National Day Light Show 2020|Shanghai Night View - see, major tourist attractions China crowded time, absolutely zero social distancing. persuasive still active cases back then, either known unknown Chinese authority, China would exploded right National Day holidays ended, like we've seen India today. Instead, seven months since nothing happened. It’s not, we’ve lucky far. Covid transfers quickly need minimize movement minimize chances variants, it’s year (with measures taken) still seeing variants vaccines 20% less effective. virus mutates decent speed point twice deadly variant could appear would nothing could get rid it. Let’s keep genie bottle Everything virus strikes again, truly all! India extremely fast respond back last March national lockdown unprecedented large country, made huge difference 1st wave never really took hold.

But turned false sense hope, led false sense security. Combined govt taking steps build facilities prepare, meant country prepared all. 

When India started vaccine drive, numbers low. Hence country went sort hubris, PM falsely claiming Covid defeated etc, ensuring enough doses.

All fatal mistakes. massive rallies held, people believed over, deadly variants emerged. combined produce 2nd wave preparation.

And govt continues deny enough. really sad infuriating. isnt recommended pace 3-6 weeks apart pfizer 4-6 Moderna? sure you’re downvoted, it’s easy feel pretty dull year basically nothing. excited go places, routine, connect people, etc. soon. think things make anyone feel sharper.  travesty aloud happen use pandemic.

The vast majority infected need treatment, neither India anywhere else. Fortunately us Texans :)

Glad see things much better around America days. Here's normal(ish) summer everyone! COVID severe respiratory virus even without horror show 65+. 80% COVID deaths 65+ United States, would still mean 120k lab confirmed fatalities year. 4x *total estimated* flu fatalities given year. 80+, &lt;65. 

We want thing kicking around, period. friends fully vaccinated since March, state open groups since mid April. data looks good terms risk vaccinated people spreading infection. point thought sort fully respect mask rules establishment, I’m friends people aren’t wearing masks, I’m going stress it. you’re crowded place without masks, you’re vaccinated month it’s open all, that’s sort you.

SF packed multigenerational families living together (a lot rent-controlled areas well entire neighborhoods jammed multigenerational families close proximity) well very, high wealth disparity (it takes lot money break poverty Bay Area, considering costs living easily 2-3x Sac). That's SF county proper, mind you, entire Bay Area.

The data show compared rest state (even compared rest country), Bay Area leaps bounds better virtually decently populated region, particularly normalize population.

Remember, SF Bay Area first place country announce lockdowns. SF declared state emergency first case even confirmed within city (so could activate emergency planning offices funding), region state secured early contracts PPE, testing, first vaccine orders, opened multiple mass-vaccination sites, yes, much higher masking lockdown compliance rate virtually anywhere else country. Even restrictions announced, large tech firms already asking anyone could work home, particularly felt illness they'd around illness. team already WFH nearly 2 weeks prior lockdown announcements.

Even now, 70% adults city least one dose business masking restrictions relaxed somewhat, still see people masking up. Hell, long pandemic, uncommon see people masking street BART/Muni felt sick want get people ill. part culture here. 10x times atleast.... People managing r still busy cheap politics won’t happen think nation Olympics held would little bit aggressive vaccinations. Americana fantastic. India people r literally dieing vaccines. news also problem. 

Scientists say something like ""we evidence kids spread it."" really means ""we know yet."" gets reported ""kids spread it!""

It happens vaccines, too. ""there evidence immunity lasts least six months"" gets reported ""it lasts six months!""  fully vaccinated means you’re low risk infected even lower risk severe case. Wearing mask lowers risk more. Wearing better mask lowers risk every more. It’s whatever you’re comfortable with. guess I’m group wearing mask business doesn’t bother much. kf94 masks still use don’t bother all. keep surgical masks car case forget masks. U.S. government pay companies $1.95 billion upon receipt first 100 million doses, following FDA authorization approval. U.S. government also acquire additional 500 million doses.

Americans receive vaccine free consistent U.S. government’s commitment free access COVID-19 vaccines.

“We’ve committed making impossible possible working tirelessly develop produce record time safe effective vaccine help bring end global health crisis,” said Dr. Albert Bourla, Pfizer Chairman CEO. “We made early decision begin clinical work large-scale manufacturing risk ensure product would available immediately clinical trials prove successful Emergency Use Authorization granted. honored part effort provide Americans access protection deadly virus.”

“Expanding Operation Warp Speed’s diverse portfolio adding vaccine Pfizer BioNTech increases odds safe, effective vaccine soon end year,” said HHS Secretary Alex Azar. “Depending success clinical trials, today’s agreement enable delivery approximately 100 million doses vaccine American people.” COVID vaccine patents Canada even have? don’t produce COVID vaccines significant quantities. Indian people done best.

Have they? People gathering election rallies, religious events, wearing masks generally ignoring facts. Also vaccine lines went nothing around block news stories changed.  Pharma industry huge, full detail, different functions know others' business. necessarily trust CMC Regulatory, Regulatory Clinical, Clinical Nonclinical - even within team working product+indication. 

Also, random kid reads cell therapies (and understands read) worked 25 years small molecules, well, might really know more. Though understand context comes experience. No. Everyone's body different. people side effects feeling rotten day so. Every time we've done experiments see mRNA vaccines work variants, get result:

 yes. work street Toyota plant, friend worked years. leave current position ready move, going first place apply. think Netherlands soon let fully vaccinated tourists waiting seeing happens? 100 people vaccinated 100 people recovered COVID, many immune? Might 200, 50 recovered also got vaccinated 150. search is. devotee god? opposite, defecate everyone's god.  Oh they're disappointed? ;-;
Yeah nobody cares Indian variant seriously affecting 30s too. already major US cities.

People India still care. Pfizer Moderna essentially identical: technique used get body create protein, achieving similar level immunity trials. There's reason believe anything response variants would differ significantly.

Boosters works vaccines, Moderna. Immunity nothing. existing vaccines provide good immunity variants, quite good original strain, they're working boosters targeted specific variants. Boosters may end happening all, depending disease responds vaccination wave. happened cousins wife first shot last week. sure Moderna Pfizer. Luckily got hospital next day recovering. makes sense. digital diary complete weekly, used in-depth one question: Covid symptoms? based full data set, that's sure. based primary endpoint trials. FDA incredibly careful conservative, overall that's good thing. shame additional trials run single shot smaller doses. mRNA vaccine technology created US licensed BioNtech Germany essentially pointless - face covering do. point making others feel safe avoiding conflict.

Don’t money-grabbing asshole. Help coordinate America rowing right direction. takes bribing assholes get need go, it. options there? Blitz country vaccines we're still looking 6 weeks see effect. Shut down, culture MANY generations roof covid hitting entire families once. Also seems areas congested I'm sure lockdown would even possible. really worse case scenario, unfortunately world may suffer dangerous variants start spreading this. get vaccinated know is.

The thing think lock country rest world control - one thing burns ... maybe that's also feasible, options there? opinion #1 #5 significant bulk resistance

That politics.  30% Republicans say going take it. Indian variant seems spread bit easier, fundamentally virus, using receptors attack cells. body trained identify combo immune system, look like COVID. attacked accordingly. surreal read comments like even abundance sarcasm reddit.

...2nd: claim efficacy 79.4% based group people failed get 2nd shot Russia's vaccination program. They've made claims basis data - linking register vaccinations register people diagnosed Covid-19.

...And 3rd claim: ""Sputnik Light proven effective new strains coronavirus, demonstrated Gamaleya Center laboratory tests."" far know, none public. Whereas here's preprint,

...that found 8/12 serum samples people vaxed Sputnik V signs indicating failure neutralize B.1.351 (""SA"" varian), etc release states 20 million doses Ad26 (SputnikV) used globally cases Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) reported.

Our hospital system literally fall apart. yeah - clearly ravaging.  article interesting points India’s population young. 

In crude terms, India doesn’t population aged 65+ account mortality rates reported (and possibly underreported).

Actually, isn't. given whole mess Sputnik live adenovirus Russia failing provide needed documentation... guess creating vaccine goal there. one takes moron seriously Thanks this! seems like unlikely I'd catch spread it, imagine would far unlikely catch, spread, get another vaccinated person (symptomatically) sick?

I know really reasonable fear, trying shake anxiety past year! reality both. base research work tax money funded. development usually unless small business still get sbir funds. grants DOD contracts also available depending product.

The clinicial trials though? That's pretty much investor funded experience. occasionally small grants, give rough numbers company, experience, even small &lt;200 people studies run 10 million range. well beyond grants really touch.

We 100% funding basic research, completely without private investment. really hard discussion around topic nation. think something like grants require % profits given back NIH/NSF/etc correlating % funding drug funded said institute think must looking numbers since murky they're leaving publicly internally using estimated range. Dude say thing lockdowns reopening. even arguing with? tested negative long enough let quarantine probably caught there. studies/links states this?

See: [One-dose COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik Light registered seem new vaccine rather exercise product positioning market segmentation. sell countries looking one-shot vaccine. May ask, believe numbers announced Chinese government, ""true"" current situation China opinion? listing several assumptions:

(A) COVID still circulating within China. People, including Chinese people diplomatic personnel expats working China, aware international media ever noticed.

(B) COVID still circulating within China. Many people aware Chinese government somehow silence them, including foreign companies, media intelligence agencies monitoring pandemic since began.

(C) COVID eliminated early China. actual numbers infection deaths way higher ones released Chinese government.

Nice $250 bonus something anyway. remember India 3 confirmed cases 15months ago, thought myself, going get real bad. bought new Rav4! Glad hear Toyota caring guys absolutely morbid question wondering anyone answer it, even somewhat. 

Basically, many need die death count ""significant"" country population size India? also, numbers rise threshold?

This country 1.3-1.5 BILLON people. Assuming overall death % reaches US (600k 350 million population) would mean death total 2.4 MILLION dead. Obviously horrific human level honestly know even significant India, grand scheme things kind way.

So ya, considered significant # reach horrible situation? Auburn WA get $10 Dave &amp; Busters card.

God damn you’re dumb. single case could go mutate cave 50 years jump fuck back wipe humanity (super extreme likely possible). could mutate much could classified another disease, it’s called evolution.  really weird actually see infection rates still e.g. Spain (around 140/mln), despite months ahead vaccinations. countries high vaccination rates like UK like 5 times less (&lt;30/mln) Israel 8/mln.

It's like guys (at least ones vaccinated) getting infected purpose something. can't even imagine screwed US would got lucky vaccines. disagree you, said hiding numbers. ""What hiding?"" Article figures based official tallies, India's proportion could even larger if, many experts believe, large number cases deaths recorded system becomes overwhelmed. really surprising company selling product says need it? downvoted think mostly right. patents contain trade secrets (how fast flow? pH use? salt concentration? Etc etc) absolute PAIN optimize.

Without those, good luck making vaccine. Even though fundamentally understand make vaccine, get raw materials, 100% replicate without probably year plus decent size team optimizing variables. even then, probably create exact thing, I'd get ""this works mostly same"".


As needlessly punishing industry, think need serious discussion nation money goes, much research costs cover, etc. much want scientists earn. appears expected number observed cohort ie 0.3 \~282,000 \~1 per million (see figure 1) especially since next it, says 7 cases observed. excess measured per 100,000. pandemic also learned lot science works vaccines developed.

In reality magical, mathematical model saying Biontech 2nd dose 21 34 days. one knows efficacy 100 it’s given 90 days 180.

What know clinical trials that’s say vaccine value efficacy. 3 4 weeks 2nd dose determined based basic science fastest time get good response needed trials short possible. doesn’t mean best option perfect efficacy. 

Going “off label” risk wasn’t tested doesn’t mean it’s worse. 

From data gathered Israel UK seems fine delay second dose. loss 1 dose folks don’t develop protection overall community protected get 2nd dose achieve less same. 

So yeah... maybe even find it’s better space more! shortage delaying 2nd doses seems great idea overall hoped country would follow. Maybe elderly folks give 2 doses anyone else 1 dose many people possible  People incharge r insensitive know r consequences. think approved children make required school would help. Pfizer trying get 12-15 year olds approved next week they're currently studying 6 months older up.

Then also add people want work person currently working person requiring it. 

Also restaurants bars start checking see people vaccinated. 

We need system proof show vaccination status though. It'd really easy fake cards gave us considering people fake mask exemptions cards happen. [America] new COVID cases

Throw benji mix shot way. Crazy. 

I’ve always thought anti-vaxxers selfish people society.

They partake benefits herd immunity worst diseases history, without part. 

They’re public health freeloaders. Drosten reckons deadly virus-strain may die one two years. 

Don't misunderstand me, million doses vaccine effective, fine. I'm tired constant self-promotion saviour world. regional add-up that's it. Like Italian vaccine Japanese vaccine close approval. huge apology Utah. neighbors idiots. currently 20% vaccinated 40% least one dose. 🤦🏼‍♂️ Herd immunity could properly defined keeping reproductive rate 1 full year. that. We're making guesses get clicks. Nice Per CDC 1 760,000 vaccine allergies. know cancer treatment something might make taking vaccine impossible. given total $350 two separate jobs also work home health care. don’t see rejecting reality asking nonsense questions civil. It’s silly redditism pulled it’s necessary content matter. Well, we're lucky, they'll die it. Random company giving us 3 extra days PTO (one day get vaccinated + extra day second case reaction). need submit copy vaccine card HR lady “credit” PTO bank. 

So guess could get fake card, submit HR lady get 3 days without vaxxed?  there's still restrictions help bring R number down. Surely herd immunity would bringing R number zero restrictions place possible. One reasons people 65+ hit hard they're older, people 65+ likely comorbidities. second wave population vs wave hit, say, Sweden India kids India getting sick vs Sweden, also possible new wave really affect children more.  remember back January covid worst, vaccines beginning trickle out. 

A buddy purely hypothetical conversation much would pay get vaccine day (if hypothetically wouldn’t jumping line, taking dose senior, etc.) 

$1,000–$2,000 price landed on, get parents vaxxed. 

I’m fully vaxxed now, still can’t fault thinking time. 

$1k–2k 1/4–1/2 year normal life, reduced anxiety time. 

Still seems worth it. CureVac BioNTech hold lot patents field UPenn.  seriously sad. also note incidence-dependent. currently low covid incidence UK (around 20), would say AZ worth young, looking 200+ per week 100k Germany 30s, whole calculation looks different. think businesses incentives require employees vaccinated. Lower healthcare costs, less likelihood employees becoming infected work awhile, less opportunity customers become sick(/die), customers want around unvaccinated people comfortable patronizing business, etc. Technically require vaccination (despite popular belief), plenty businesses vaccine still permitted EUA. Currently yes, vaccines still work, well. health conditions booster good idea, ready covered fine vaccine (if one mRNA vaccines, appear efficient read). Awesome! Glad feel better got someone else  immigration fix lol. people move countries dont like countries do, hence giving countries incentive better immigrants mean, prices get $40 per person, per day, really say ""no?"" Yeah, that's everyone tries mean. that's well defined either since seasonality changes dramatically. instead pick arbitrary cutoffs based total guesses, like ""we get herd immunity 70% over-18 population vaccinated"" go that.

These projections useful, far every single prediction herd immunity turned wrong. problem vaccines approved kids, mostly still aren't. Kid physiology react different adult physiology. They're trying last time checked yet one approved anything 18 area Pfizer that's 16 up--and even emergency use protocols FDA, standard protocols. vaccinations rolling people there's clinical trials underway kids hopefully get wider immunity. Hi, CDC say lingering viral pneumonia barrier vaccination, based condition, really think offer advice without knowing like doctor would.

Can place call doctor? unfortunately apply employees. said, 1099s actually mislabeled 1099s case, otherwise qualify benefits employees qualify need data this, far seems like Indian variant ain't different ones (there differences, huge, given mutations already exist variants - brazilian, cali one &amp; south african one). vaccine works current variants, reason totally stops working indian one. people known current SARS-CoV-2 infection deferred person recovered acute illness (if person symptoms) met criteria discontinue isolation. recommendation applies people experience SARS-CoV-2 infection receiving vaccine dose experience SARS-CoV-2 infection first dose mRNA vaccine receipt second recommended minimum interval infection vaccination, current evidence suggests risk SARS-CoV-2 reinfection low months initial infection may increase time due waning want vaccine get fucked. Yep. Outside curious watch restaurants, grocery stores, retail handle it. don’t see suburbs rural Minnesota jumping continued restrictions. We’re lucky international media reporting fearlessly real picture India. already lot storage Curevac producing themselves. bottleneck atm is, can't get sufficent ingredients (some come US part export ban).

Bayer needs get infrastructure ready, like manufacturer. Curevac yet market, huge hurry. BioNtech, Moderna rest going available large enough numbers Curevac importance. Curevac play big part vaccincation campaigns coming years. Since seems virus stick around - similar flu - need new vaccines every year. admittedly epidemiologist, think part consideration reproductive number would *sustainably* stay 1 (which weeks now) without special precautions.  CA seems like headed metro areas though. According Uhaul AZ TX popular destinations pretty big generalization, no?

The cost vaccines less diagnostic test, highly doubt mRNA technology would exist nationalized system. Nice. 1099 gig jobs?  Ireland counter said people considered ""fully"" vaccinated waiting 4 weeks first dose AZ (but still must wait 12 weeks second dose). period J&amp;J two weeks Pfizer Moderna one two weeks second dose respectively (5 6 weeks first dose).

It make lot sense scientific POV reason considered fully vaccinated allowed meet people private houses (which technically anyone quite unenforceable) thought interesting idea try incentivise AZ compromising fact works better longer wait. Yes well lol avoid make shoes wet tbh.  [This publishes weekly stats current numbers blood clot cases deaths UK.

Looking them, risk clearly higher around age 60 due sheer amount people age jabbed relatively low number cases, vs lower amount jabbed age relatively higher blood clot case count. saying is...

hodl People sure love cruises. I’ve never one don’t know I’m missing out. stories norovirus pretty awful, add covid cruises. sound like floating petri dishes. I'd bet workplace compiling vaccination data try plan could bring us back office full-time. several laws place waive patents drug companies “unreasonable”

To date one acted far aware. IMO tells us everything impact IP waiver idea might have, certainly mRNA vaccines.  people never worried covid first place Herd immunity defined enough population immunity drop reproductive rate 1. reproductive rate currently 1, either herd immunity now, term actually meaningless.  bar Clements course.

Moderation question: rule 9 enforced daily US vaccine numbers?

Not anything thread (it's something rule), would like know posts treated same. factor think matters.

Literally kid making sandwich subway liability forgot wash hands multi-billion dollar company?
Stand product release it. why? Especially point time? Demand still far outpacing supply, would paying people incentivize get shot? Unless see massive drop-off younger age categories, sounds like someone phishing handout anything else. “Countries EU worse Covid-19 outbreaks Canada still established travel corridor summer per vaccine proof. Why? “

Because Canada it’s country gets set priorities. lower Covid death rate per capita (both historically currently), US Europe plan keep way. 

We haven’t chance start vaccinating older kids yet eligible, plus success rate one dose variants questionable. 

“However, group volunteers infected showed much weaker immune response variants one dose. study showed level neutralizing antibodies 11- 25-fold lower B. 1.1.7 variant compared original version virus, “resulting majority individuals falling protective threshold.”

The research team said findings also likely apply variants circulation, P.1, first detected Brazil, B.1.617 B.1.618 variants, first associated keep getting people falsifying covid documents travel, there’s little support vaccine passports US. saying scary possibility something hurting worse scary disease?  issue sample size reporting.

Berlin, Germany (but actually Ireland originally, clicked post) spaces probably always wear mask future – u-bahn (subway/underground rail system), example. moment, using u-bahn – bike everywhere – point, vaccinated twice weather biking, imagine getting back it. without mask, honest .... even coronavirus worry about, still tons viruses sometimes really packed. probably applies flying ... probably continue wearing mask planes. biggest vaccine producer planet actually Serum Institute, giving away vaccine cost. Early last year generally agreed Covid going absolutely devastate places like India. Surprised they're unprepared this. happened yet mean variants exist. Again, India underreporting things, say variant already occurred India? Also, many variants found later due lack analyzing sequences infections real-time. One example Brazos Valley 2 Brazos Valley 3 variants found Texas A&amp;M University; find variants analyzing genomic data, happened several weeks past original infections. Yes. Government issues patents, government could follow transparent legal process remove ability patent new medications. Changing rules (without congressional vote less) whim theft matter much may try justify it.

PS. know trendy criticize libertarians...but I'll remind Libertarians favor government monopoly patents...at all. republicans democrats blame system. think annual COVID vaccine booster shot horizon? Thanks time. [Study here](http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths), essentially looked excess mortality countries controlling historical trends (though factors taken account try avoid incorporating excess deaths covid-related).

Any study like going inherently require level educated guesses, methodology looks pretty solid.  would nice law required employers couple days pay shots.  shot knocked butt two days loss wages.  hope second shot kinder. got moderna Walmart.  expect get taken hard.  guess better. question, would like thank work! case WA/VIC, case.

Our local media saying particular case leaked quarantine Sydney. genomic link returned traveller US brought virus tested positive quarantine. yet establish epidemiological link.

Leaks happen time time, especially cases within quarantine high. claims debunked thousands times sub alone last time articles got posted. yet people keep parroting things despite new information coming in. spanning globe, from Canada to Bangladesh, ready produce hundreds millions doses provided know-how. unable start. technology shared, manufacturers could produce doses quickly, Moderna Pfizer last year. would get people vaccinated countries, make fewer countries dependent wealthy ones. Monopoly control critical public-health technologies cannot justified global got production capacity it’s put use. started last year, could shipped millions doses now. supposed like wartime effort, everyone together. doesn’t seem case.”

 Without Borders demand affordable access Covid-19 vaccines everyone | DW patents waived, China probably set mass production record time flood world generics end pandemic. African nations won‘t resources set production themselves.
On hand, lot know-how-advantage German also American companies mRNA field lost future development. sort understand dilemma. Germany directly funded CureVac Biontech lot taxpayer money.  Problem is, CDC media keep lying people vaccine stop transmitting others. So, according them, taking vaccine save people's lives.

If believed CDC, think would've gotten vaccine myself. people vaccinated? everyone entering country vaccinated month before? know Australia enough vaccines, vaccinate anyone border. Sorry, can't claim nation rule law state appropriate property flick pen much congressional vote. 

I get coming from, legitimate argument made around removing ability patent medications, specifically vaccines... argument made congress. 

No matter justify extreme circumstances are, boils fact sanctioning theft property. 

If state serious helping countries, state would offer BUY patents release. easier steal gunpoint.  well two choices: 
1. keep everyone masks/locked air side caution 
or 
2. Finally allow study take form.. 

Eventually feel soon people going enough put foot down, especially vaccinated people. cant find stops spread (I believe well enough situation much longer.) scared work ""lock forever"" want go back scared understand. seem Russian government's goal simply destabilize rest world every opportunity? They're like toxic human hates humanity, government form.

Focus fixing fucking country, sociopaths. maintain power way opposed creating chaos everywhere else. waste time? Stopping someone entering crowded room probably covid? late them, it. stop giving people. Yes makes feel better, show. edgy use term 'covid theater' ? read article study read methodology lol start increasing incentives hundred day like article says, that's day work me. That's big deal. Esp since lost PTO getting vaccine.  saying IP waiver feel-good motion accomplishes nothing? zero calorie option? come number? link goes back reddit Acts legislation.


Try again? Stand corrected. thought read, included South Africa too. Tks.  Link broken. I’m taking down. alternative link feel free repost! Canada needs work getting covid control letting anyone Well, states, supply demand, imagine coming north. hope least. everyone “chose” mRNA ones, would 75% fewer people vaccinated across world today. Given variety good vaccines available (some mRNA, not), vaccine shopping discouraged. ""US birth rate continues fall following trend established decade covid also majority children born last year would conceived pandemic started anyway""  Ontario. vaccine clinic, dont even know they’ll still run clinic using. It’s theoretical appointment.

My astra Zeneca pharmacy family doesn’t second appointment either. Don’t worry we’re also disorganized. this. essentially need every adult vaccinated reach herd immunity original covid strain R0 ~2.5. variants become dominant US, foregone conclusion, threshold herd immunity almost certainly 80% - 85% humans vaccinated infected &amp; recovered functional immunity. Poor people US also children rich people That's roll.  non-death, long-term COVID risks table, also put non-death, long-term risks imposing ~2 years abnormality children table.

It's equation risks harms sides equals sign. federally enforced lockdown legal, tried it, could enforced.

But lockdown long enough strict enough halt spread virus almost impossible. Remember never stopping virus preventing deaths ""flatten curve"" really possible. roughly happened, endgame vaccine natural herd immunity. sick fuck three days injection. Fever, chills, everything. That's big if. Exactly. predict would happen *after* pandemic ends? Especially Florida.   pandemic existed 20 years ago? dealership directly Toyota? work US facility.

Yeah, Moderna shots, Saturday 2 weeks I’m fully vaccinated. card entered info computer. CEO fled UK threats IP bottleneck, many people know stated this, reasonable IMO ask ""will decision negative effects""? 

Vaccine research production ghost town recent decades organisations foregoing sector limited profit potential, often generates bad PR always sights government intervention. COVID vaccines produced easily best return investment government spending imaginable, anywhere world. Yet still talking confiscating IP, including IP organisations waived rights pandemic provided world profit free. 

If planning way ensuring vaccine research returns underfunded backwater COVID, prepared next pandemic would suggest approach near perfect. Dumb tokenism reinforces historical failing. super place responses, really sure point trying make. all. employer giving us 800$ bonus eligible, one vaccinated. Coworkers saying bad vaccines ran got shots real fast According worldometers, deaths past 7 days 7% week before.

In event, deaths lag cases several weeks! none first usual sore arm. Hoping second one same, even feel shitty better alternative. Meanwhile got overhear neighbor day explaining someone want get idea what's it... chain-smoking cigs. Super awesome. love god please Sweden. I’d take J&amp;J heartbeat. month late grandpa. Whole family leave home 15 months got went south less week. Glad oldies getting vaxxed. Moderna German invention now?  
They need continue restrictions people get vaccinated. Why? Cases plummeting everywhere. Random musing: I’m fully vaccinated back normal things (restaurants such). haven’t really felt anxiety anything feel like I’ve lost lot patience dealing people general. Everyone annoying loud! restaurant meals mediocre! hope feeling goes away. Or, could give 2 paid days get vaccine? Yeah, stickers look like? 3 weeks ago drive Detroit get vaccinated Michigan government claimed underserved opened county clinics city. nurses without patient patients there, one city forced drive too. Who’s underserved? follow-up second surge, 11 068 (2·11%) tested positive first surge. Among eligible PCR-positive individuals first surge epidemic, 72 (0·65% [95% CI 0·51–0·82]) tested positive second surge compared 16 819 (3·27% [3·22–3·32]) 514 271 tested negative first surge (adjusted RR 0·195 [95% CI 0·155–0·246]). Protection repeat infection 80·5% (95% CI 75·4–84·5). government knows received shots many? realize that, currently?

Ive heard stories people getting multiple shots Good job Komrades  cruise ships hire foreign workers skimp U.S. taxes anyways shouldn’t subject U.S. Florida’s laws anyways. like international law. Require vaccines. COURT FIGHT! shame people safe. HR monkey here, last conference call, company said specifically ask see ask getting vaccinated. encourages management give people time shot state law give pto recovery. guess flaunt want. Lol Yes?

What's point? ""government"" monolith. Laws patent issuance set Congress enforced Patent Office. whole system cannot simply ""waived"" President. I'm saying I'm it, saying many Americans would Minnesotan, I'm glad they're tying vaccination rate. I'm really happy Walz state leaders followed science every decision they've made pandemic. Great post online Holy wow long time, good job! true, doctors decide patients. find strange, would pay way $100 get vaccine right offered 32 employees gas stations $60 get it. three takers... granted rural AZ, long road ahead us. ehh doubt Minneapolis will. already nearing 70% adults first dose. surprised see Hennepin county get 85% plus get shots 3 4.   idea we're seeing slight uptick deaths week US? Really anxious see massive dropoff cases deaths vaccines. need rush it. Another month two okay. disinformation. CDC says vaccinated spread virus. wear masks, incase spread it. I'm vaccine got it, would accept retroactive $100 company state gave me.

But millions people firmly believe vaccine dangerous full computer chips dead babies whatever, would still take abandon principles $100? tells poor Americans are. Unless they're targeting people anti-science, need $100 hire babysitter rent car something getting vaccine hassle.

Although guess can't surprised, insane numbers people vote guy knocks bucks taxes even means pay 2x much healthcare year road. breakthrough rate. Vaccines work, cast doubt efficacy. agree risk covid 19 much lower, think risk clots greater younger age groups. 

I understood reason vaccine hesitancy lower age groups *comparably*, risk clotting issues becomes closer risk serious illness covid 19.

So clotting statistics still stand thought? incredibly rare case. I’ve India. country full scams w/ people trying make bucks anything. Vaccines likely “fake” different. inevitable democracy probably corrupt world. Looks like saying still end sight public health measures masks, hate give us hope dropped.  Oregon. many right leaning small towns counties anti vaxx. We're 30% thousands open appointments now, locations even need appt. They're making easy get shot, people want to. Sucks rest us. time beer, June? July? beer persuade people, next gimmick bigger. next even bigger. give beer lol. Yes, understood. possible excess mortality evened covid vs causes, I'm doubtful covid death rate 700+ people per day. post responding referenced CDC website noted recent data run behind final death tallies. could explain currently reported data. use TGIFridays across town? world, 38% pregnancies planned. developed countries, 55% planned, uncertainty interval 42-56% unplanned.

This standard practice. something ""thankful for"".

I've learned stop surprised many us believe weird things. really know numbers are. Yeah cigs ar safe lol. tool! wish would open border Canadians coming get vaccines, sooner region vaccinated better, dumbasses don’t want vaccines give Canadians do. Sigh made stimulus dependent vaccination. $400 first shot, $1000 second. early studies showing kids ones bringing home virus families instead parents primary cases households. parents can't stand around kids day used studies try get politicians open schools. 

Of course, studies done time schools daycares closed kids without parents, course kids bringing COVID home families. mean kids get infected outside home. beginning, predicting US would worse China, Italy, Iran based slow govt response CDC hesitancy face masks. also remember commenting face masks preventing asymptomatic spread early February, April (2 mons later) CDC finally recommended masks. They're giving 2nd doses Canada? Must Canada invention. Benton Yakima actually pretty impressive vaccine rates compared counties. Probably flooded long. proof testing preventative measure. virus insidious... Great idea! think mobile I'm commenting remind laptop later. I'm half vaxxed; getting second Friday!

Had bit rough time first one, really looking forward second tends worse... worth it. Hmu Sputnik Zero ya increase rapid speed vaccination Germany. I’m really impressed see numbers rise quite bit every day. Guess see boosters come around. Mine not. Believe me, tried. Beautiful sufficient incentive well, someone wants give hundred bucks well, I'm certainly going turn down! wonder Alberta close overwhelmed terms health care anything it. triaging cases parts province due covid cases... remember, unwanted mockery face even though intelligent scientists created highly effective vaccine. Work progress arent herd immunity yet. need (at least) 70% people vaccinated get vaccination rates slowing diabetes onset eager get vaccine ASAP thirties. dont get people wanting roll dice covid. Giving money average ppl general better use gov funds right VS giving select business'.

Plus ppl get shots? Win win.

Dude. provided example politicians placing restrictions whole system due individual poor choices. provided example politicians placing consequences \*individuals\* individual poor choices. making point specific Russian? disinformation work generally. know vaccinated people infected test positive, though much smaller rate unvaccinated.

We infer fact possible vaccinated people spread disease least occasion. know often happens, there's good way experiment find out.

We also know vaccinated people far less likely infected first place. infected, can't transmit. getting vaccinated slows transmission dramatically even assume every breakthrough case transmissible normal case.

But end, really matter whether breakthrough cases spread disease many people vaccinated every case infect less one person average regardless whether case vaccinated unvaccinated. Looking Worldometer covid page, Japan's big covid waves occurred January 2021 right now. yeah suspect lot change calendar year. seems like everyone know want feels like they're patriotic noble getting it. weirdest thing. wish theyd go cruise.  someone can’t vaccinated medical reasons?  question is: scared? got two doses panicing? lot folks get worked vaccines. worked want vaccine. already two ""jabs"" worried ones pass panic efficacy. Stress one worst things body immune system. Masters gaslighting, obstinance, projection. vaccines propose risk pregnant? affect embryo? Yeah... so... I'm gonna go I've seen past year half say that's gonna happen. Careful? Science? Ha. We're Americans, here. :/ Yeah, numbers they're giving Japan US either require several hundred thousands deaths causes gone unreported COVID displaced several hundred thousand deaths causes. Neither seems particularly likely. none first tired 2nd. said, I'm sure tiredness shot related. mention decline deaths UK falling faster decline cases. compelling vaccination effect, lock-down effect USA gradients same. 

Another confounder number doses administered per 100 population figures (69 per 100, 10 days ago). UK slightly ahead gap still widening. 

You really Pythagoras realise first-doses-first strategy works. glaringly obvious now.  Found American. 

Actually, China already mRNA technology. BioNTech, German company made mRNA vaccine (that Pfizer peddling), licensed Fosun Phrama. Doesn’t matter live: birth rates falling everywhere across globe according declining curve. Africa SE asia fifty 100 years behind Europe curve declining same, manner. monitoring clinical efficacy currently important labs. determine substantial drop efficacy (eg, 95 percent becomes 50 percent) would report ongoing interim analyses. would certainly report regulators firm would incentivized make public well, think, implies long term business them. (Of course want end pandemic, it’s even better good deed sell 3 billion shots annually next decade). I'm still wearing mine time, even though I'm fully vaccinated. extra safe. meanwhile, NJ, hardest hit state, everything full capacity....tomorrow.

we can't even keep fast rates plummeting here. basically going 6ft indoor mask rules, murphy said he's willing scrap 6ft rule CDC gives green light.  actually technically lie date first shot sign second dose, Walgreens lets schedule one day ""window"" Wednesday time could go week still qualify want risk losing appointment waited Tuesday sign up. feeling people boat, trying schedule around work taking day side effects hard. ETA: live bay area people opposite vax hesitant worried appointment would get taken, know there's doses everywhere really wait extra week lol. ""most hopeful yet"" hope low like saying drop water rn desert ""the water we've yet"". poor decision Biden administration. Patent limiting factor. need government, particularly US government., spend increase production capacity.

Another thing remember vaccine might work well infection variants, nothing well protects severe disease death. determined T-cell immunity, spots virus targeted cells largely unchanged generally take much longer undergo significant changes. Antibodies part immune reaction (which sad schools usually focus antibodies teach immune system students). entirely accurate though. mRNA research absolutely subsidized DARPA NIH last decade already working testable vaccines within two months thing becoming pandemic.

That's refreshing us living states governor tells mayors ***can't*** require masks. Let guess, would also forgiving student loans people already paid student loans get benefit... wrong? data tells efficacy holds bit. It’s better people vaccinated efficacy 60 70, people 2 doses. 

In shortage think that’s good decision. really don’t lose anything many deaths... Things developed vacuum. attitude local production always better.
Yes local production electronics etc. frikkin vaccine.

We approved vaccines start. Every citizen could chose get. best product would excelled. absence best vaccine, least could got others. 

It's secret one take multiple vaccines 6 months apart needed. Mutations work way. Covid going keep mutating vaccines 0 percent effective. There's limit.  expand benefit everyone got it? loses? Watch bhakts blame Muslims Corona even though escalated Hindu festivals...

No one going btw like sort hypocrisy signed date, get $150. sign date get $100.
