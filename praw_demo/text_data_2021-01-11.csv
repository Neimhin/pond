*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Huh? happened dad. nepotism, many people refusing vaccine wound giving call. 

His company asked certain number employees get vaccinated county extras called company said employees living county could jump line 12 extra doses had. 3 people accepted. town got offered remaining 9 town public works employees, 7 people accepted, still wound 2 left! hope somebody got instead trash, even county clerk's great aunt twice removed. Strawman.

The soviets declaring war ended it. USA takes credit it.  disrupted flight refused follow flight attendant's instructions.

As understand it, that's crime. hope escorted straight police station. hell Hemmingflock sparrow? true sign apocalypse: hope vaccine administered shuttered American icon fringe movement say moral way live save planet. shits giggles, let's little math. ill make numbers still work. 

1000 people, 100 get sure thing 95% effective vaccine means 95 good 905 potentially infectious

1000 people, 200 get hopefully 60% effective vaccine means 120 good 880 potentially infectious.

net ""savings"" less 2.5% trade clinically proven, double blind studied ""hopefully"" tested. Synopsis? want give huffpost clicks. doesnt simply happen overnight, especially “pandemic” Social media really magnifies severity outbreak. Fear sells. VITAMIN D.

No shit people NYC March would harder time people Florida July. standardizing across variables, vitamin deficiency sets BAD time, without supplementation vitamin deficient far north late winter/early spring. enough skin exposed strong enough sun enough time Winter.

Florida Summer? UV index 10, hot balls, humid. swimsuit, short clothes, exposed skin.

Vitamin alone could explain difference disease progression entirely. wfc person wrote Windows File Copy Dialog, take initial bitrate speculate file finish copying 23 years?  It’s also extremely easy tested congressperson. dedicated lab anyone works congressperson get PCR test morning receive results evening. Would difficult get tested immediately. notice ones refuse wear masks properly start shouting? exposing people germs have, shouting, they're exposing maximum number people. though. Depending situation. normal one doesnt it?

Dont get wrong, I'm it. dont want forced buy expensive single use masks. government forces to, want pay it. I'm fortunate position able afford without going broke, many not. Thats basically reason think law ridiculous. Actually expect Bundesverfassungsgericht outlaw goes effect. IIRC believe Oxford vaccine promised get millions doses Pfizer one, hence believe slow start. The, uh... what? Good luck trying contain variant highly transmittable virus. like seeing gave away? obvious dislike eating animals? Yep happens me. Waitrose seems particularly shitty it. ever need go near customer service, there's always one idiot rushes you. stand around chatting groups middle shop, without masks, customers bothering wear masks trying distance squeeze past them. absurd. always absurd customers asked wear people shop day, mix people, not. matter. It’s nuanced implying.

Bigger beurocracy = moving parts Recently saw asshole make comment along lines ""at age 94, surrounded family, Sir David Attenborough passed 1 million instagram followers"" literally CDC trying advise got huge backlash it. seems like government ability print 2,000$ everyone needs per month, coupled therapy creating jobs (like maybe greener economy?) could trained build homes come decent carpenters giving foothold society. 

Look Scandinavian countries, especially Finland homeless policy

Just read article: 1 million empty homes Canada given time 

Maybe rich/corporations didn’t easy way park money low taxes wouldn’t incentive vacancies. 

If taxed vacant homes certain point would reduced rent etc. 

Same air bnb, house market can’t sustain condos bought dozen “relatively affordable” are


Tax tax tax tax tax tax that’s plan need PREACH Right SA shockingly banned ivermectin COVID, cheap broad spectrum antiviral works great extent : No. Takes several weeks. keep mind real growth happens level 2 level 3 spread. I’d say see real impact Christmas start seen first week February. Again. Start... top everything else going on... everyone coming (I guess potentially storm knows else) capitals every state soon, start another wave we’ll see around start March.

You cannot vaccinate faster stupidity spreads. can't lose world treasure yet depends live. ICUs US pretty much fill every cold/flu season, rare occurrence, fear sells media. 

I think statistics show depending live, containment measure benefits may outweigh damage cause. see politicians like Cuomo beginning realize this.

I know liberals like admit wrong, sometimes need order determine next steps towards progress. scare like Yeah, makes sense comparisons Denmark I'd expect Swedish numbers similar Denmark's right now, course can't *only* compare countries they're similar ways. Denmark like around 3 times deaths Norway, Sweden around 3 times deaths Denmark per capita. Stockholm seem similar population density cities like Amsterdam. Netherlands seems similar development Sweden pandemic, although bit worse. still seems like done better though. Unfortunately, think “just pretending” problems big deal they’re fluke kinda we’ve found are... ones COVID March/April displayed much serious disease higher hospitalization fatality rate opposed ones got Florida summer came back NY.

That's soooo nearly enough information draw conclusions.

The much probable answer ""people NYC March/April MUCH likely Vitamin deficient people FL July/August"".

It's old news vitamin deficient bad immune response broadly. old news people NYC March vitamin deficient. old news make vitamin sun, Florida, aka SUNSHINE STATE, south July, make days' worth vitamin 5 minutes outside tank top shorts. basis lockdown forever movement covid done. Probably since new. imagine trying get booster shot done relatively quick study could get things completed quickly.

Its shame didnt also kore variants, one shot spaced shots. way you’re complaining 95% effective rate. fucking hate sub sometimes. along lines think. sure % though 43rd, futureman  got first dose back January 4th getting second dose 25th! I'm excited! like frustrate me. Honestly, places like California taken away outdoor dining, states, cold. Yes, vaccine here, young, healthy people WFH getting several months. ""journalists"" instructing us never see people outside household. Come on... Normal probably means different things different people.

I think people (not sub) thinking COVID binary thing spectrum. current accelerating rate vaccinations deaths hospitalizations plummet start spring cases gradually tapering throughout summer fall. enough things start changing regard lockdowns, especially low risk (or already vaccinated) population. lot people low risk category, normal may well happen spring campus college classes start again, restaurants reopen, etc. would imagine resistance largely comes fact N-95 masks a) significantly expensive b) pain arse get hold compared cloth masks surgical masks selling supermarkets etc. Glad hear it. hero planet! Brill thanks - guess two straps, top bottom, sounds bit fitted tying two loops together elastic. Wow one study 10 people another 76. That's certainly irrefutable evidence right there. /s Every time see David Attenborough headline heart skips beat. vaccine? closed schools.

Not högstadier below. think believe good young children school. close schools. Especially grades still considered children, high school university students hardly considered seem mistaken fact talked herd immunity initially proof actually implemented strategy.

No, actual proof Tegnell clearly states they've chosen herd immunity strategy Peet Tüll. supporting evidence. naive, one really thinks going get better. want hear told someone holier-than-thou attitude. course problems going go away overnight, go pat back shitty Nostradamus. kind sad Congress testing everyone bunker matter policy. Even small time &lt;20 person company time there's exposure (and notify every second degree separation exposure, ie, employee found contact known positive) nobody know vaccine queen took? vaccine get? Ehhh Quebecois things... seen Alabama, fam? Personally I'd ignore law buy head court penalized. judge worth salt laugh law court unless N95 masks easily available affordable. 

I fully agree wearing N95s ridiculous expect whole nation suddenly get one overnight People fucking dying man playing “oh can’t anyone skipping line, let’s give teachers aren’t even person right uwu” Yes.

Also 5% get it, none hospitalized trial... reduces risk COVID actually unlucky 5% almost entirely.

Will annoying hear reports like this. bad attenuated vaccine.  week half back march. must recovered well. grandma. without insulting UK’s scientific experts first. you’re going steal ideas there’s need slag us too. got stressed sec seeing name sub Video room Jayapal sheltered in. maskless members congress present laughed offered add point: also get three shots, necessary. 

Another problem strict adherence 2-shots-in-three-weeks create another bottleneck. Since cannot let medical teams idle, capacity reduced towards 50% (happens Germany). week three could theoretically keep first vaccination pace constant suddenly teams actually vaccination. 

The alternative strategy would hold back maybe 25% required 2nd doses pump rest full beans. would nearly double amount people getting first shot. Presumably first shot gives immunity, first three weeks double efficiency. concerns understandable, eradication Covid pipe dream. Getting manageable levels feasible goal. Fuck heart stopped. read Sir Attenburough covid... received stage 4 cancer diagnosis May 2019. Still chemotherapy treatments remission since Nov 2019. pandemic, doctor already warning colds flu, serious compromised immune system. Birthday party one year ago last public appearance. went bedridden exhausted essentially house arrest. 

I feeling strong healthy atm, cancer come back anytime, feel pressure build memories family can. miss road trips, would love see parents again. son wants see snow. camping summer, state closed campgrounds. frustrating see half population give two shits mandates flaunt priveledge everyone else literally sacrificing safety select feel ""normalcy""  

Im sick everything. 

My oncologist feels confident may get vaccine soon February. Would nice go without dodge anti-maskers everywhere. course, I’ve worn mask everytime I’ve gone since started haven’t complained once. also always wash hands upon entering house make effort social distance out. 

10 months in, I’m honestly taking changes society stride I’m unfazed point. I’m emotionally prepared another year mess need be. news didn’t know needed Same. got mine last Thursday. Friday felt kinda eh. Saturday kinda miserable. Sunday perfectly fine. nice hear. Nice one. Ebay  Let guess, vegan? expect daily life feel similar pre-pandemic “I’m sure ever will. go back pre-covid-19 normal. instead exist world new normal. even part determined availability adequate vaccine supply cover everyone high, middle low income countries. look forward day office hours pre-covid-19.”

My point answer, statement first cited, emblematic prefers pessimistic. **could** said, regards first dose, know, limited testing data trial. instead phrased way sounded bad suited purpose speculate (""non-neutralizing"") served purpose speculate (but likely time, even one dose) , didn't. 

We know two efficacious one, also know one still efficacious FDA willing approve back October. keep mind, whole thing still plans giving everyone second dose anyway. lmao, apparently /u/PUMPEDnPLUMP familiar concept dynasties. occupying power. try sugarcoat it. Super bowl parties houses make look like minor spreading event. 

NFL fans won’t wearing masks. Nothing article 56 obliges Israel immediately send thousands vaccines PA. Israel required ensure application measures necessary combat spread contagious diseases, allowing Palestinian healthcare system operate freely, allowing passage vaccines (procured PA) medical supplies PA, treating thousands Palestinians Gaza WB Israeli hospitals, including COVID, full compliance article 17 Oslo Accords.

Article 56 require Israel provide Palestinians living PA-controlled areas health services provides citizens. Unless handling frequently think fine. would eat one offered me. got title queen lol son sensory sensitive hated ear loops. cut normal loops mask, bought elastic craft store custom fit straps go around head place. sewing machine used good hand stitching held well. search head masks etsy find pre-done preferred adapt ones make sure got perfect fit head size slipping.  deeply saddening true. man wanna smoke dope forget saddening right, eradicate ..maybe ever. really going pearl clutch that? need get manageable levels. reason regions reported weekends, weekend statistics pretty useless anyway reported. 

And really reason necessary anyway. rate spread quite constant lately, fast changes. Reporting weekends well would cost additional resources adding little value - resources better spent actually matter. No. looking single dose.

That's big question, though. things work new changes vaccine companies able manufacture enough doses keep up?

I'd feel lot better predictions J&amp;J and/or Astrazeneca close getting approved. never said didn't. person replied said getting vaccine automatically meant pass anybody, correcting them. could happened however currently evidence idea. think Sweden's numbers accurate Worldometers' data incomplete? proof vaccination? months immunity achieved. 

What mean? thought wait month first shot weeks immune? Stop getting upset things nobody said. article said responsible, social distance wear mask public big group, put immuno-compromised people risk. Depends people are. exactly trying min/max.

Let's say wanted minimize deaths.

95% efficacy one 93 year old would better 60% efficacy 93 year old 60% efficacy 25 year old. agree, although it’s really 70 even 75 high risk. It’s 10x per decade older. LA less, 1 10 COVID-19.

Guess wants Live Free Die Hard.  yeah less cautious around (who vaccinated) first phases hundred people?

Also, thanks info! person asymptomatic ans never got tested. New administration coming in, control starting get handed current oversight loosening. chance start pushing changes they've unable make.  long go doses without mattering?  Literally everyone knows this, upvote baiting post comment like  maybe not, made statement agree disagree you. 

America shitty snowball effect indefinitely fucked us over. done 8-10 week start. I’ve stuff since March, full remote school.

The crowd never gave shit (and still don’t) prolonged point it’s effecting peoples mental health. can’t stay house nothing another year. “life sucks I’ll push through” way “this brought back depression” kinda way.

This year fully shat mental health continues I’m gonna ‘selfish’ leave house bit well.

If people comprised showed could stay home year, proved could stuff remote, people could carry on. government incompetent many dumbasses idealist version lockdown.

Sorry comes across rude whatever I’m good time rn :/  understand 33% one looking over-60s, whilst 60% one looked overall Thanks link. I’m surprised papers haven’t published numbers. Didn’t know available. Wow... hurts hear. needed good lockdown early fumbled. Makes climate change look unstoppable. Man die hard absolute drop bucket 

gimme break eliminating harms reducing harms.

Right u.s. 150% predicted deaths daily covid virus. deaths coming lockdown. majority aren't. 

You also ""locked up"". still lots do. hike, kayak, canoe, camp, learn dance, learn language, advance career, paint, sew, million hobbies do. limit direct exposure others less people die. I've still incredibly fulfilling life respecting lockdowns. can't you? afraid alone yourself? need mindless distractions like yourself? get it. common problem. right now, following precautions work that. Hopefully licensed counselor therapist. know decisions made consultation immunologists, epidemiologists doctors? Many agree good way save lives.

Here thread explaining this: Birds take flight Sir David Attenborough gets vaccinated. niche word. proof vaccination? Mid last year saw reddit comment someone else dug guy NYC November 2019 describing sick days difficulty breathing eventually recovered. IIRC way described sounded much like COVID months alarm bells here. Seeing pic slowly reading title, thought going different post.  Yea man people sick Iraq shit , time beat next drum I'm 30, 2020 look like 65, get vaccinated? Agreed. I've less agreed logic behind decisions restrictions point, even really tough choices made. seems silly. Nothing world magic bullet, vaccine looks like effective measures we've taking combined. reasons think keeping vaccination right maintain social norms mitigating spread enough population vaccinated. Also, suspect underlying condition would make susceptible even vaccination, means take steps protect yourself. Vaccine moves us realm public health crisis realm take care keep healthy. Production continues ramp up.  It’s fixed supply.  Congrats replying 43d old comment. things considered large number compared days weeks months

So what's bullshit it? Die Hard think Lol everything outta control wanna get strict. Makes sense smfh Ok what? county needs large area established transportation infrastructure mass vaccinate county bigger half states US. Disneyland adjacent interstate, local roads capable handling heavy traffic, fuckton parking unheard SoCal. Orange County tiny dot map yet population almost 3.5 million. really don’t care tax dollars go Disney brings us inch minute closer achieving herd immunity finally restart economy get back normal ASAP. vaccine demonstrated 100 per cent efficacy relation severe illness death. Would rather this, wait get vaccines? probably depends live.  mean, 2010’s identified Arab Spring stuff related that. Fuck US EU whole west earlier. Travel people planes ships banned day 1 pandemic, 1 year later. getting Venus. Even getting Earth PETM stretch. Ok.  People learned nobody policed first one. seems...unlikely Murphy went among competent COVID-19 governor meh.  Really disappointed lately. needs facial hair. Looks quite zombie like. good Olympics 7 months? got second shot hours ago! can’t ever express grateful opportunity one first people California tiny county get vaccine. Thank BioNTech everyone involved got shot family. many lives going saved coming weeks can’t wait us get back something resembling normal life. &lt;3   news? Australia cases. afford wait get enough Pfizer Moderna doses Broooooo. one highest per capita countries world almost nothing slow spread! Maybe start local restrictions worrying people coming in. Hell would make sence require test negative leaving! vaccination animals coronaviruses exists side effects, also prevents disease SECRET CELEBRITY VACCINATIONS - rage news Slovakia
There enought vaccines hospital employees celebrities (actually living Dubai, taxes) secretelly skipped others vaccination. created super rage internet here. let know... early phases (phase I/II), played dosing amounts decent amount. end, front-runner, likeliest get early encouraged conservative, chose pretty heavy dosage numbers (hence 2nd shot side-effects larger normal due inducing large immune response), pick one move forward ASAP, did.

So, handfuls data smaller / different doses, they've ran single Phase III single dosage amount ~50k people worldwide test efficacy, on. that's done, 110% manufacturing facilities used provide that. Given know antibody response generated infer protection actual virus, / could use generate schemes / doses (and fact proposed such), run quick trials also. know they've started trials younger age groups different dosage amounts, read they've done anything starting trials smaller limited dosing large scale -- have/had kicked dosage trials, think went towards focusing limited resources main trial. wanted to, could done ~3 months. redo whole part proving works -- monitor immune response / antibody levels representative population short period time determine average response, etc. Pretty standard all-in-all vaccine deployment, honestly. LOL looked it’s clearly social justice based approach. Maximizing benefit one three considerations. “Promoting Justice”and “Reducing Inequalities” seen equally important, felt since elderly disproportionately white receive much benefit. Already I’m nauseated - real problem math. never present logic results - conclusion. That’s huge problem given clear agenda help favored racial groups, beyond basing math reported case numbers.  severely understate number essential workers already contracted virus never tested - therefore overstated benefit vaccinating terms reducing spread.  also overstates direct benefit understates relative mortality benefit vaccinating elderly vulnerable first.  much Covid disinformation campaign Singapore? I'm 30, look like I'm 69 2020, count? TIL Lionel Blair still alive. Dude old '80s. Sir David Attenborough receive vaccine. vaccine seeks approval Sir David Attenborough. Excess deaths accounts population growth aren’t using right is. It’s really hard get patient risk recently Covid infected individual exactly (and they) getting them.  seem prevent 70% outcomes needing hospitalizations. plan still give everyone second dose anyway. saying problem happens distribution, like first dose ""wasted"" anything. plan still give everyone second dose anyway. saying problem happens distribution, like first dose ""wasted"" anything. Lmfao state doesnt give shit work grocery, go purely age based healthcare/teachers. fuck new hampshire DHHS fuck sununu. Well, specifically said less cautious know at-risk family vaccinated. would someone that? waiting personally vaccinated change anything Article says walked away without making purchase. sounds like verbally refuse, stayed quiet left.

Sounds strange. certainly shutting indoors perpetuity.

Of course not, that's article advocating first place. They're putting forth staggered return normal:

Stage 1, get vaccinated, feel free hang vaccinated people private, continue wear mask social distance public.

Stage 2, local herd immunity, return less normal, travel internationally regions without herd immunity. surprised still see small precautions, like servers wearing masks restaurants.

Stage 3, international immunity, it.  report NYC area restaurants trying pass fully enclosed temporary structures ""outdoor dining,"" despite indistinguishable indoor dining?  Yes, people die. ones willing take risk stay inside. act like lockdown lockdown costing lives long run. act like solution one benefits society biggest drag it.

Tell me, long think 100 people locked save average 4 life years? know Texas using VAMS? Aww, poor little Brucie-Woosie recognized wearing mask needed little ego boost? sad, sad loser. Nobody wants look asshole-like mouth, Bruce.

-Terry Gilliam (confirmed) never deadly vast majority people begin with. Forgot trademark. Yeah, looks like was. Thanks letting know! say scared. accurately pointed young people ""running numbers"" perfectly willing kill people. attacked refute it. Taiwan..NZ..vietnam..china say hi....

Norway...iceland....finland...
denmark say hello Honestly, unless friends ""reinfections"" verified laboratory PCR, much likely simply long-term symptoms. imagine story going get repeated country. *ton* people probably going get vaccinated local pharmacy, go party crowded bar without realizing takes weeks immunize. people planning travel February New Year’s holiday, fearing trapped hometown able return work. 

Hoping best China. Yup, saying like something totally nuts twist  Good point! Unfortunately, think eyes companies commuters tradeoff worth look whole Wuhan thingy...if somebody lets them. Oh worry it...worry motivates people..while fear actually moves them. trying move direction survival. do. see people wanting open schools even risk teachers vaccinated cause “kids can’t get vaccine yet!” lower population, lower chance superspread taking root well. spread Covid quite overdispersed, giving statistical advantages small populations.

That said, Atlantic bubble caused miss funeral, wedding, birth niece. haven’t seen close friends loved ones since March likely won’t forseable future. really alive lowest possible risk getting Covid.

What saw Sweden overall temporary decrease lifespan 4 months. Given generally quality quantity guy, personally don’t think worth loss quality life. average still is? One article e read said 70% England. guess lot depends ICU capacity determining patients send there. Oh phew. Gonna need someone narrate documentary cluster fuck. need every single one working right now. 

And reason hospitals overwhelmed right disproportionate amount medical resources vulnerable populations (like elderly) use get Covid. Vaccinate elderly vulnerable, greatly reduce workload hospitals. do, kind cherry picking (I like refer video: always able confirm beleive Internet, looking would confirm beliefs. fact substance cause canser (like red meat, unknown stuff Cola, basically processed food) stop eating it, different vaccine? Yes , vaccines mercury it, mercury cause cancer... mercury fish.... still eat it, alive. polio vaccine reffering likely killed noone, maybe hundrends millions, polio killed every 2-5% children 15-30% adults. fuck it, take vaccine, noone knows whats new cola processed food eat, noone knows ingredients, never tested like vaccine was, still noone cares. vaccine tested, serious side-effects. What’s ifr? common it? Saying “kids get killed covid” doesn’t merit it’s similar 5 kids worldwide point view EVERYTHING power still slide somehow 

Please understand friend got unlucky. demoralizing, know, seeing something like person. rips away sense control. please fall trap mistaking statistical outlier norm. false, potentially deadly, thinking.

Preventative measures reduce risk low, zero. That's still enough spare people careful, statistical outliers happen somebody. Even something 0.1% chance happen (made-up number) person, means happen 328,000 Americans. people friends family see think likely happen them, well. boat, hard remember 327,672,000 Americans *didn't* happen to.  He'll fine, mother nature allow pass he's narrated every creature exists 2) Redefine normal include masks protocols ""it can't hurt""

This worries me. Masks normal.  Seriously though. never came reddit year. subs great. Others insane. Facebook. become toxic. I've lost least 25 friends family members year, online like, never want see status.

Luckily people know real life covid deniers fanatical everything else happening now. administration even less interest before. ""The Centers Disease Control Prevention’s requirement negative Covid tests, reported earlier Wall Street Journal, could take effect Jan. 26"" that's best lies invent, he's qualified politician. 30,000+ people, going getting asymptomatic testing due job, travel, exposure, etc. positive asymptomatic test one people include data. didn’t go looking asymptomatic cases, don’t good idea effective vaccine preventing asymptomatic cases allow links tracking websites outbreak.info.

I think still contribute education masses. yep gravitated towards anti-lockdown subs felt zero risk culture grew covid mitigation strategies bit unnecessary top, tend go far direction me. They’re very, anti mask also anti vax. It’s one thing restrictions regulations, entirely different thing together claim masks don’t work vaccine isn’t safe. That’s anti science drag whole thing further. They’re actively working one silver bullet get us crap.

So true saying 20,000 cancer diagnoses per year people age 20?

There 599 deaths covid age 0-24. 33 times likely get diagnosed cancer die Covid age bracket? Still shitty thing since ties supply whenever ""donation"" finally happens. months agaio early 1st April joke?! fuck, really?! FFP2 mask everyone 13 million region? WHAT??? Oh wow. common you? guess I've never heard people getting sick vaccine itself, new hospital employees getting it, community based healthcare. I'm Florida occupational therapist working hospital system I've vaccinated none therapists know working private practice clinics access even though see many patients direct care do. wheelchair evaluations ATPs (assistive technology providers) come hospital clinic evals literally work patients go homes way get vaccinated hospital employees. insane me. think hospital working broaden vaccines provide community care providers like ones mentioned right sign infrastructure still built. Everything way slow. Hospital administrators getting community care providers. Great! need protect natural treasures..! Good always section population can't vaccinated, either due health conditions anti-vax attitudes. kids region 30x less likely hospitalized 40-50 year olds 70% adults vaccinated would think risk less flu, kids vaccinated countries. I’d like suggest headlines including name begin “Still Alive fine Sir David Attenborough...” longer case get get Except office real estate thousands businesses cater busy business districts. Permanent teleworking would incredible change society many businesses eliminated. sure hope so. 300k would awful. Hopefully updates today better numbers I've heard same. wife's employer (a healthcare clinic) actually recommended plan second dose they're work next day. Sounds intense wants it’s silly think anyone else that; we’d social distancing life think continues debated looking holds value think does. Great way traumatize kid life. Alcohol solution. thought worked english # YES LOL!!!!!!!!!!! step door ... [EMERGENCY EXIT] ... let hit ass way through.    
[middle finger emoticon] Maybe current CDC workers want chance keep jobs? state decided vaccinate teachers, sone hone 20s 30s seniors living nursing homes. efficacy different things - infection, symptom, defined number symptoms, severe symptoms etc. look defined study. That's one problems here, various people said various different figures based different definitions study released could see exactly measured.

The Pfizer Moderna efficacies infection, symptoms. Although know actual definition could 2 symptoms. Fuck man saw “r/Coronavirus” “Sir David Attenborough” heart dropped. scared me! It’s difficult get test 72 hours travel. People behaving like whole time without vaccine there’s way people pay heed vaccinated. Oh know not. think they're disgusting. Reddit media app have. Soon one eithet Eh, change proof vaccination She'll probably fine. 55, female, probably obese. demographic pretty high survival rate. perform swabs routinely Phase 3 trials Pfizer Moderna include asymptomatic cases data? Highly skilled qualified nursing professionals cheap. TIL, cheers Got it, got think family roof. Better late never guess 🤷🏽‍♂️ Evolution finds way...we must evolve too..the best anyone days strive get smarter stronger. think okay suspicious long hardline it. unusual fast came read possible get done fast, scary proposition get it. know media sensationalize say cause harm would false, kids still die covid. Yeah live Central Valley even though lock restaurants still offering indoor dining... mother law lives Florida wide open says restaurants area full capacity, it’s bullshit accusing you. Just, friend posted pics daughters hospice mom. agree it. private moment shared like that. Social media ruined us. gee wonder social distancing mask usage could impact transmission viruses well

What COVID masks such, effective, squash it?

It seems flu 99% squashed masks social distancing, covid also?   Ok.... rule long time. years. International travel going something doldrums decade. ""We've trying contact register company Google..."" Pass Cholula Incorrect many reasons, here's few.

Vaccines include part virus accessible immune system making immune response primed reinfection. 


Vaccines often include substances known adjuvants stimulate immune system respond even disease viral components alone. 

Most vaccines include two doses seperated apart ideal length makes immune system go 'oh shit, disease going away, really hang immunity disease!'.


Many viruses directly interfere immune system helps survive spread. cause immune memory disabled weakened. feel free wear mask indefinitely. I'll continue wearing time leave home pandemic. afterwards. It’s really logical assume e_e especially realize covid shares similarities SARS common cold   Look you.. exposed...

2 seaguls yelling MINE MINE....MINE

While flockimmnunity moved on

the relevance astounding.. evil echo chamber resonates...melody kinda cat stratching but...  covid absolutely become excuse expand surveillance state long past end pandemic. 

most things used 2019 probably coming back though. places ask wear masks going places go enjoy yourself. I’m even Hispanic grew California there’s “tamale ladies” around Xmas time. guys hot chocolate peppermint stick Ol Saint Nick...I’m hunting tamale ladies  Well everyday learn Covid virus like really crazy mind own. Obviously fan Sir Keir Starmer Thank goodness Pronouns too. Fuck identity don’t care! Mmmmm maybe... doubt though. There's already news coverage damn year Year! People still dont take serious. But! twat twitch change minds braindead followers disagree.  actually hilarious. real? year later decide this? plenty covid within borders go around anyway including contagious variants. joke. changes CDC vaccine guidance seems outgoing administration trying save face final days. Ahh.. travel, yeah, that’s problem. idea Israel prominent antivax community. 

I’m hoping pediatric vaccine sooner rather later, too. would nice knowing littles least little protected infection. hope guys stay safe healthy... it’s difficult time parent right now, sure. Protect man costs. LONGLONGLONG OVERDUE 

You realize travel spreads place place  knighthood.  27M distributed. 9.3M arms indicate adminstration supply current issue. almost 20M could put arms today. nothing releasing second doses make number 40M flu vaccine grown chicken eggs, case many vaccines including COVID vaccine.  know, care, least making decisions didn't. schools aren’t even extreme precautions someone citizen socialist country due surpass United States power next 5 years, would say capitalism failed. funding sent ahead time planning...Such summer 2020. Still enough, take get. pandemic hit 30 years ago, would've front line worker, want vaccinated me. father elderly trying get vaccinated, sure hell want get priority me. take deep breaths remember I'm working home, I'm getting exposed way, high priority. holy f\*cking sh\*t sick ready anything, even arsenic jab, trick.

Okay, going back deep breaths now. Surely needs /s Handmaid's Tamales  They're finding doses vials thought would be. Also J&amp;J coming soon Oxford probably month that. EU still failing, almost one got virus vaccine yet, US looks pretty good compared them--But Israel good job getting people vaccinated bet really remember like that, refresh memory.  seem apprehensive trusting people telling data legit, seems call educating reading scientific literature despite preconceptions yourself. could expect significant death rate decrease February, no?

You’ve got remember slow virus is. People exposed TODAY probably aren’t going die February. 

Plus, there’s lag time get vaccine you’re actually protected (and vulnerable people weak immune systems definitely need second shot protected). It’ll probably early spring really say we’ve turned corner.  Damn, nana! lot sub Doomer Central want ensure one sees kind positive news. situation bleak, yes. Yes people dying, never discounted. 

However making bigger bigger strides towards controlling day. that's something continue look forward to, foster idea ""solving"" crisis rather letting crisis run roughshod us. AZ joke. screwed bad.  don’t like opt online learning isn’t going change time soon

I think might responding somebody else, point?

Children already back school many states questionable regulations thanks financial issues; especially inner city schools larger student bodies. lot parents money opt online learning [low income families usually stay home parents], lot teachers workers education putting harm's way choice. unemployment bust.

I think important thing protecting educators time being, finding ways create safer environment involved. instance, parents feel safer sending child smaller classroom instead packing classrooms like sardines. state provide options, even options expensive lieu vaccinations. NYC Teacher - appointment booked Friday! Got girlfriend’s grandma Dad first shots today sent info dozen people get registered. People really nervous shot, I’m getting mine show everyone it’s nothing afraid of. That's really question sensible minded people. Good hear this, encouraging Congrats, old man gets Friday. Israel different case. essentially first country world get big second wave getting third. Ireland amazing job avoiding second wave now. imagine it’s new strain got countries avoided lock downs, enough people still view person dining health risk restaurants still close wherever virus contained.

Sure can. know limits knowledge, don’t know medicine level, aware studies technically true, grossly misleading, like Lipitor study. Looks legit me. Turned out, wasn’t. fooled scientists. admit that.

You aren’t anyone favors giving false hope. 
[Check page 40 CDCs November presentation vaccine Notice absolute BEST case scenario (assuming vaccines prevent transmission) vaccine rollout prevent 25% potential COVID deaths next 6 months. vaccine rollout went slower expected. 

This isn’t going flip overnight aren’t going going back normal March. states US giving vaccine first come first serve kind basis? Um. He’s completely correct? realize economy also lives? Thankfully, get second dose next week  I'm NY Cuomo said repeatedly waiting heard immunity. isn't. He's starting argument. reason.

Arguments involve point right one sided conversation.

Why can't discussion nobody. point made, all, relation person's particular experience. 

Again? first time told I'm discussion nobody. Christian saying refuses tithe church, getting attacked? what, exactly?

For reasons explained ""attack"". ***always*** say ""what's point all"", even told point is. fact inclined makes pathetic. bet Christian.   scares people starting devalue “life worth” order get vaccines first. healthcare worker get it? prisonsers getting first? elderly getting first? work so, get first.

I one question ask; vaccine do?

Saw arguments news meant band Slipknot wears like creepy full-face masks fans def gear shows lol Yes point. willingly choose get potentially life saving vaccine consequences alone. nothing wrong sex worker. 2021, let women able decide body. Jesus! allowed work without it. plus side daughter stoked get poke..... Yet😜 never anyways can't tell difference
They still watch Netflix changed? 🤔 Yes. states targeting elderly senior care facilities frontline healthcare workers. Distribution guidelines different depending state. federal guidelines. single flu yet far.  Yep---Israel too, today Israel reported 9756 cases, that's US equivalent 351,012 cases Hey, blame assumption, pretty reasonable (if incorrect). yeah heard scary seeig peopll fightinf throats variety things

and point nurses get vs non nurses

it’s literally devalue get covid vaccinr Paywall China seems place that's immune. envision 6 year old would go police wasn’t illegal? 

I don’t even understand question, 6 year olds aren’t adults wouldn’t legal. ""hit reset"" code screwed need time fix things. 50% opinion look 20-40% Health Care workers LA county 60% Nursing home staff Ohio refusing vaccine. keep mind people put front front line need actually believe 50% may generous. least start with. people talk keep mind I'm 30 talking younger people tell getting it. Add polls people saying trust Vaccine think 50% reasonably fair assessment. scary people news think otherwise Wonderful! im asking people debating im seeing people news complaining scares me

first cant getcause reserved

then im important cause im public worker

then recently mates

im curious people know vaccine supposed bit early tell, data point favor peak, hospitalization numbers (nationwide) plateau'd week now. Hospitalization good predictor daily deaths big lag factor case numbers do. thing can't take account concentrated hospitalizations are, obviously highly concentrated pockets like LA results deaths perfectly spread across Healthcare system.

I really think see things getting much better February (cases/deaths) act digging one step deeper asking ""why"" ""how"" rare nowadays. internet become amazing source information now, feel like trained people lazy. look ""what"" without considering logic behind it. think part reason many people fell victim anti-mask propaganda. People trust information without considering truthfulness nuances behind claim. bruh, got this. “Children Become meal ticket mother” quite offensive. seems like right wing welfare mother myth. need prepare worst case scenario, hope best. way around.  added details. edited right away apparently fast enough. Shows much years actually make difference demographics. One cases median doesn’t tell whole story. sucks horribly. past week isolates people longer excuse beliefs. Iowa here. Ha ha.were open. 40% positivity rate. nothing like employer made flu shots mandatory else leave duration flu season.. Kind poor decision hindsight hospital short-staffed due nurses leaving, nurses catching COVID, course, nurses off-duty due flu shot refusal. Governor Cuomo tweet today. cannot make stuff article states 12+ data ready September Under-12 available 2022.  Dude middle reddit dream. praise tamales made old lady ambrosia Gods.

It’s one thing find childcare, it’s another thing willingly choose let kids education go mothers work full time young school age kids often order continue work. It’s rough. go back December 2019 lockdown everything month. heros wear capes. ~~some wear fragrance homemade tamales.~~ Hahaha aweeeee. Kid it’s past bedtime    wish presence mind that.

Took 1.5 hrs get Dodger stadium parking lot NLCS. problem going getting someone give child vaccine. Finally glad see it. That's way go.  Anyone else get Moderna vaccine bad side effects? got vaccinated yesterday, felt fine last night. feel got COVID-19 awhile back. take today work due bad feel. *Game changer*. hurry already???? that's ending stick gorilla.  Yep media clever spin positive facts bad news.

We developed deployed 90%+ effective vaccine less year see negative headlines. Herd immunity years away, vaccine rollout failure, politicians trying salvage careers botching rollout, someone got vaccine died, experts worry (my favorite -- headline literally someone worrying) vaccine effective strains, etc. relentless drum beat negative news.

You're reading way deeply something there. Yes, know virus extremely dangerous, that's I'm extremely cautious catch it, question posed conclusion another fact, factual series events, I'm asking first place lmao

I swear can't even comment site anymore without someone telling comments intentions were. Keep bag still work. Oh, they're going Biden plan.  Per capita matters, less doctors, hospitals infastructure too. production limiting factor. USA 50M doses (have double number distributed feds holding back roughly 55% doses) used 9M. makes feel better, 330k+ fatalities US, far 100 age 0-14. Kids little risk statistically.

Other vaccines usually tested administered adults least 16+ kids come later. Given minuscule risk kids wonder even develop kids. cataluna luce luve, managed 80000 vaccinations total missing one essencial point: country different procedures define death due covid not.

Belgium loosest policy word. They've counting deaths suspected confirmed covid.
 
Had US done since beginning death toll would much paid like 1.7 Euros per mask. That's really expensive. use multiple time, long get wet damaged. Maybe developed federal plan...

Oh well, like 9 months literally nothing else anything. Drawing conclusions single anecdote good idea. would really need whole contact tracing analysis know.

Also expert means, main worry inconsistency comparisons flu various governments etc. one hand say may become endemic like flu, need keep updating vaccine like flu ones. side say much much worse flu, surely making new vaccines isnt going enough control it, vaccines need also manufactured given large enough group stop spread. 

It seems virus manages mutate past vaccines become endemic massive trouble working lot harder stop it. Even means manufacturing enough vaccine beginning vaccination program vaccinate everyone short period time Exactly! won’t see taking one either. course its' going stop coming back. Lockdowns last ditch effort pull back out-of-control spread keep hospitals functioning buy time rolling vaccines. ways actually stop pandemic widespread vaccination, widespread immunity enough people catching it.

See comments /u/curiousshallot2 below. using two different placebo, countries comparable epidemics controls aggregated. 

The FDA consider AstraZeneca trial acceptable. Coronavirus Clan scroll Gorillas get infected.
I’m going go something else. shocking 😃 Vaccine passports would mean young people, don’t need vaccine personally, need continue isolate vaccinated old people socialize. 

Fuck that. isolated them, either open all, one. 1) fundamentally getting whole citation concept. make claim, expected response “oh yeah, says who?”, claim needs cited. say “Lebron Janes scored 30 points last night”, doesn’t require citation fuck else would damn NBA. Again, ask you, world expecting say asked citation? fucking farm report? Bill O’Reilly Show? course source comment US developed vaccination prioritization would damn report outlining developed vaccination prioritization.

2) didn’t realize confusion. certainly understood points healthcare workers never argued them. idea equating healthcare workers “essential workers” two groups discussed endlessly recent weeks assumed definitions fairly well understood most.

3) Race isn’t “mentioned” report. essentially report. 3 criteria plans ranked nearly two, meaning basically decided strictly based “equity” category.

4) appear agreeing report clearly lays would save lives give vaccine older people first, I’m sure you’re arguing here. straight said didn’t remember exact number. may 30,000, need check math also clearly isn’t 1,000. We’re supposed couple hundred thousand people die next months, could reduction several percent 1,000? would like reduction .3%, right? mean could cause spread, think would superspreader event. people watch event homes. Biden wizard.

Logistics supply chains already best. much hucking money support problem.

Shit takes time. Vaccinating 200+ million people fucking *hard*. can’t get one love money Atlanta. really cheap... least use multiple times handle properly. wonder demand increases now, certainly screw people. meant reason people getting vaccinated even though sick. SMH feed prisoners... smdh

After Unused Vaccines Thrown Trash, Cuomo Loosens Rules don’t know spell better you. guess we’re going agree disagree. wish, refer timeline above, numerous articles including own, well assertions.

You correct evidence took mask off. Since we’re assuming kept whole time, we’re also going assume gas masks don’t work.

I assure I’m trolling you. problem chamber Republicans, Chamber huge, segregated party, though I’ll admit don’t know exactly sits, seems far indoor gatherings go, safe-ish compared small room. Like example small room claims got COVID in. Canada scramble find sources it, one last place orders.

My point incorrect. Given said previous federal government secured agreement Aug. 5 Moderna 20 million doses vaccine, option procure additional 36 million doses. U.S. announced deal 500 million doses days later, U.K. European Union inked deals Moderna past two weeks.

Canada bought vaccines everyone, sure might tried order Chinese one early, mean anything though. Lol boys vaccinated bars open, we’re holding back. It’s like you’ve avoided car accident driving all, someone tells drive store buy new seatbelt. quid-pro-quo? school districts city remote right teachers isolating due either illness exposure there's enough subs.

Maybe *extreme* covid risk intolerant .... holy smokes. I’ve seen some
Bad takes - wear masks forever .... shouldn’t open early 2022 .... saying you’re going let kid socialize live normal life there’s vaccine ready ... disease less likely kill flu......? 

I’m one likes comment stuff like point, it’s bad parenting. bet ones don’t let kids play football “long term effects” potential concussion, advocate take climbing structures playgrounds ... ‘they’? SF. first city stay home orders. even sit park, cops would actually tell people get Yes husband happen sulfa antibiotic, Bactrim. long taking sulfa petechiae show low platelets? 3 doses antibiotic (about 1.5-2 days). ICU doctor said couldn’t Bactrim platelets low (his platelets 1) fast, couldn’t drop quickly due drug must chronic ITP. show medical journal articles show connection Bactrim DITP. still didn’t believe it, husband monitored year half blood tests platelets normal ever since. frustrating. still made doctor add sulfa allergy list! Anyway, curious never met anyone else reaction sulfa! Yes, fully admit early tell. whether active hospitalizations peak week next, *very* close it. 

Part due hospitals reaching capacity throughout West South putting pressure admissions and, therefore, active hospitalizations. inflection definitely due that. 

On flip side, think easy underestimate vaccines take make meaningful difference. 23 million people United States age 75. Vaccinating even half - bit 10 million - cut overall hospitalization figures ~15% deaths even more. 

Obviously right now, vaccines gone health care workers, elderly. going change coming days, least couple million 75+ folks vaccinated long enough start protecting infection. Despite small numbers, start able tease effect data soon - today, next week two sure. Hmmm. instead fighting constantly, body basically petri dish keeps feeding virus everything needs. Got mine real question is...what’s plan?   think there's varying approaches policy level confuse things. 

Some mindset complete start get everyone start vaccine series fully immune move on. think still main principle adhering to, definitely makes sense individual perspective -- offering someone dose 1 without dose 2 standby deviating know offer best protection. 

Others idea get many people one dose, could give partial immunity. Again, kinda problematic groups maybe immune moving deviates priorities vaccine trials. Maybe useful logistically though within priority groups, obviously grandpa wait another 3 months get second shot ideal. Seems like going get shot increase chances getting flu staying home will. hear you’re saying. theaters concert venues barometer everything else.

Yes, comment replied communicated well. again, thought “immune” still seems sufficient conversation, unless alternative, “immuneish.” Fine.  Here

And please educate yourselves. Saying n95 cloth masks foolish statement. masks
Also called medical mask, surgical mask loose-fitting disposable mask protects wearer's nose mouth contact droplets, splashes sprays may contain germs. surgical mask also filters large particles air. Surgical masks may protect others reducing exposure saliva respiratory secretions mask wearer.

At time, U.S. Food Drug Administration approved type surgical mask specifically protection coronavirus, masks may provide protection N95 masks available.

N95 masks
Actually type respirator, N95 mask offers protection surgical mask filter large small particles wearer inhales. name indicates, mask designed block 95% small particles.

Health care providers must trained pass fit test confirm proper seal using N95 respirator workplace. Like surgical masks, N95 masks intended disposable. However, researchers testing ways disinfect N95 masks reused.

Some N95 masks, even cloth masks, one-way valves make easier breathe through. valve releases unfiltered air wearer breathes out, type mask prevent wearer spreading virus. reason, places banned them.

Cloth masks
A cloth mask intended trap droplets released wearer talks, coughs sneezes. Asking everyone wear cloth masks help reduce spread virus people COVID-19 realize it.

Cloth face coverings likely reduce spread COVID-19 virus widely used people public settings. countries required face masks, testing, isolation social distancing early pandemic successfully slowed spread virus.

While surgical N95 masks may short supply reserved health care providers, cloth face coverings masks easy find make, washed reused.

Masks made common materials, sheets made tightly woven cotton. Instructions easy find online. Cloth masks include multiple layers fabric. CDC website even includes directions no-sew masks made bandannas T-shirts. want insensitive case lying, per CDC's numbers, 32 infants died COVID 2020, making 0.18% total deaths children 1 year. actually know someone whose newborn died COVID, that's literally one-in-a-million tragedy. *you* mean ""Sweden advocating herd immunity approach?"" clearly initially. Tegnell toured world Skype whatever enlighten people flawless method - numerous occasions! [This NRK one example. also written proof free accessible interested. stops spreading covid others. incorrectly use masks touch that's you. Damn really hoped social distancing traveling permeant. N-95 electrostatic charge. Fitting matters also. fold staple mine better seal. German state ( Bavaria) require public transport.  great news, Time see negative comments. WTF?

Everything online lectures learning exams. feel like idiot trying responsible go vacation summer lot friends did. narrating it? think really compare us nordic countries. live alike, we're socially isolated general, live apart, comparing us with, say Italy, makes little sense. remember story back April May Spain lockdown someone busted walking pet goldfish lol. Sounds right. Stockholm self ordered tests gone 15% positive week 40 (9k tests) **41%** positive 16k test week 53. week 40 steady around 14-16% long time. Yeah old stash renovating. back April mask crisis n95 stockpile felt great.

Influenza reaches maybe 0,5 - 1 billion people every year, covid seems infect 50 - 70% whole world stopping. mortality difference comes. Covid maybe 2-3 times deadly flu, covid infects people, spreading more. think best answer, certain areas anyway. 

It's amazing see politicians cut funding government services, years later complain service working well. Yes better nothing n95 ton better.

N95 filter 0.3 microns .

A cloth mask earloop mask little compared n95 true all. onboard one shot getting second.. we've become conspiracy nation would trust mask bought Amazon marketplace sellers. tons counterfeit/off-quality goods sold there, Amazon stand behind claims made. 

Amazon decent quality program brands, best tell sell N95's. vaccine nearly 100% effective preventing serious illness. vast majority deaths people 65. 

If everyone 65 gets vaccinated (whoever wants one) would cut deaths atleast 75% thats extremely conservative.

You saying would cut deaths 25%? 65’s would protected group people would dying higher rates?

Also couldn’t find saying source. Nice ? friends newborn baby died covid. gunna chill lol much ask media simply acknowledges America fucking vaccinate rollout? Thank fuck think that's kinda limit data on. think there's probably handful cases test positive many still immunity. gets kinda janky think start running small enough numbers false positive one tests could confuse findings. Many people spend 1-2 hours per day least public transport. Again, likely poorest people, tend jobs allow work home difficulties find affordable living close work - option public transport. Right now, insurances covering federal rule. October, switch many insurers moved back standard care rates. result people avoiding tests care due cost.

While sounds great say ""Maine cover it"", reality states great financial position, federal aid late small compared states paid out. appropriate. painting dust etc. brain cynical automatically read 1.25 new daily cases barely surprised. 

&amp;#x200B;

I delighted see wrong vaccine ever 100% safe. potential risk catching COVID passing along community far far outweighs small risk vaccine causing injury though.

It's like arguing going wait seat belts 100% safe. always freak circumstance may better outcome wearing belt overall risk way way way higher abstaining. 

Wear seatbelt. Get vaccinated can. probably UK variant. US lockdowns - even used - cannot control that. people wait, they're also waiting infected. Good also concentric circle. people unwilling get vaccinated likely taking every precaution avoid infection. people already accepted that. mean take virus less seriously, however. daughter bringing shopping

It's possible cashier touched every item groceries. last thing I'm worried point. don’t source, hasn’t assumption always overwhelming hospitals would cause number rise due inadequate care? He’s struggling mentally since beginning. is, well, used pilot. think he’s breaking point. Another 3 months lockdown politicians talk even tougher rules straw, say log, break camels back.

There still case made get flu need hospital bed, might get ICU bed, state capacity even now.

Especially healthcare workers. perfectly qualified administer vaccine. already building. hard get people already scheduled fucking building. yeah,we tired💀 Wow uhhh....🤔🤔

So french really kinky shit eh? Respect! Everyone know came home Christmas got tested coming home, self isolated requested got got tested Ireland days. Stop ""no testing whatsoever"" BS.

Actual ‘healthy’ doctor died two weeks getting COVID-19 vaccine; CDC investigating They're still transmission vector. virus around forever vaccinating subset population. data hospitalization rates children much lower adults confirmed cases, reason believe children often asyptomatic adults, actual chance serious complications probably even lower source linked.  Pfizer's second dose gave headache fatigue. ppl know took day work it. Funny I’m schedule Biden! Easy remember google forget got guess. skeptical NG deployed Washington slowing vaccine distribution, things consider.

1. states, State NG vaccinations, alongside civilian healthcare workers.
2. Even NG deployed Washington vaccinations directly, may involved distribution way (ex. packing/transporting doses, setting vaccination facilities, logistics, etc). Taking NG picture would slow vaccine rollout.
3. Besides DC NG, State NG's may involved security missions inaugural period.

With said, think nation would tolerate slowdown.

Turn computer good hard look yourself.  deal struck month, Israel already vaccinated 20% population.

Israel secured lot vaccine doses relative population striking deals early (Moderna early August) overpaying, sometimes twice much countries. Plus pre paying vaccines approved.

Distribution absolutely played part, despite getting large number vaccines per capita, took 3 weeks distribute 1st dose ~20% population. Outstripping absolute number vaccines distributed almost larger countries.

Lastly, Israel really small compared European countries, like average. plausible protection lasts longer 21 days falls gradually. 89% effective means still getting lot protection even begin fall exactly day 21 (which coincidence would be).

Good idea, though. trouble feds holding second shot inventory there's reason endpoints suspect B117, sort of.

You really believe fact guessing many infected somehow indicating advocating herd immunity strategy? read actual study results, I'd surprised that's case. There's reason given participants CV19 tests regular schedule received first dose. anybody see celebrations Alabama last night. Civics gonna rip new one. Yup, KN95s/KF94s even comfy 3M N95s.

Where country happening? heard anywhere that's opened essential workers without also open everyone 65+. I’m agreeing you. Maybe misunderstood first point then? I’m saying, majority people vaccinated, there’s reason keep restrictions up. point, you’d assume hospitals longer strained.

Nothing. 

Having schools open leads herd immunity.

They closed schools.

Ergo: herd immunity strategy.

Whats unclear actual actions taken?

You seem mistaken fact talked herd immunity initially proof actually implemented strategy. IHME predicts 150,000 additional deaths course pandemic without intervention. [source (see, it’s hard provide links data you’re discussing organization generates lots varied says difference deaths averted vaccinating non-LTCF 65+ first would 0.5-2.0%, cost increased case load. 2% difference *in death improvement caused vaccine rollout*, overall deaths.

If Phase 1B/1C vaccination responsible averting every single expected death dropping death toll zero - won’t - talking difference *at absolute most* 750-3000 deaths.

Even 1000 number hilariously generous overestimate, trying charitable point view - would require Phase 1B/1C vaccination responsible averting 50,000 deaths. IHME expects rapid vaccine rollout avert 15,000 compared current projection - true number probably 75 300 deaths. still putting anything pos admin ""It typically takes weeks body build immunity (protection virus causes COVID-19) vaccination. means it’s possible person could infected virus causes COVID-19 vaccination still get sick. vaccine enough time provide protection. ""

Yeah never got that. Sometimes HCWs like... true.  GOOD. deserves  takes time get immunity getting vaccinated. also single-dose Bane I've noticed people skeptical pfizer/moderna even though trials showed perfectly safe simply brand new technology. people probably choose J&amp;J.

Which ironic viral vectors also new technology. people basically saying *I want RNA delivered cold virus lipid nanoparticle, damnit!* different 1 star rating... Pfizer's press release publication trial data stated vaccine ""demonstrated 95% efficacy preventing COVID-19 without prior infection 7 days second dose."" use phrase ""preventing Covid-19"" seems imply keep experiencing crazy severe symptoms. 

Antibody response begins far road regarding covid infection. Many people never even generate antibodies, rather innate immune system takes care even happen. people generate antibodies, weaker response.

As well, there's evidence Covid19 specifically modifies cells create memory cells, resulting less stable long term immune response certain people. Meanwhile, Covid vaccine protects much robustly- get massive antibody response comparison, none fuckery memory cells actual infection gives you.

Comparing Covid viruses tells us nothing. Rubella operates differently coronaviruses, operate differently compared flu viruses. know common coronaviruses recur populations every 2-3 years, ""herd immunity"" strategy via infection always doomed fail. Coronaviruses ""do"" herd immunity, vaccination does. 100%. Gives us good shot Might wanna hang onto start getting sick colleagues public transport again.

2021 Scooby Doo, you? Never Covid Ape Man(4K Remastered) Seems like laser focus deaths, actually. COVID thing avoided particularly high risk population something nobody wants get. Got mine today!! id, give people qualify damn vaccine Hey, aside, co-ops talking about? resources locating online see what's available?

(I'm looking move months, young toddler, I'm researching communities.) Jesus BFFs prostitute. Guess civilizations declining thousands years. Please show example data country state successfully ""protected elderly"" defined seeing material, correlated rise cases elderly cases young adults go up. I'll wait. 

When say age-integrated, means elderly interact young people. Whether healthcare, food, family, do. Pretending like 60+ simply isolate completely everyone 60 impractical. 

I'll stop back forth chain unless present data support preposterous ideas. ready think fuck saw covid, rising, U.S. sentence risk children quite small. flu significantly deadly children. saving grace pandemic children largely unaffected. real risk schools community spread. Get teachers good vaccines confer personal protection get kids back kids, even without vaccine. People think consequences teaching entire generation fear others live solitude severely mistaken.

A much bigger risk kids abnormal development poor education, especially lower income kids, falling behind future competition college job opportunities (even usual). Yeah there’s difference politician promising things things actually happening. state manage two days vaccinating 35,000 people, won’t reach 1,000,000 ten days, that’s promise. Game time factor exposure rates impact. Older people group homes vulnerable, living home might much less exposure risk.

Likewise, vaccinating essential workers reduced spread, protecting everyone.

Finally, vaccinating health care workers keeps medical system running, providing health care COVID patients regular ones.  said, imagine feel outbreak Virology conference worst possible optics, might inclined play things safe. Boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em stew Thank information well communicated answer question. wondering painted beautiful picture me. Makes sense. Saved click. 
Take Vitamin also Vitamin K. Please giving false hope. That's pace nearly half population done April herd immunity time Summer hits, enough people choose get vaccinated. Ultra 2015 fantastic, well Red Rocks 2014. Two favorite events. results it’s 60% effective two full doses. accidentally gave 3k people half dose followed full dose ended 90% effective. pretty fishy think FDA making rerun tests data GOP fucking educational system since Reagan administration. think problem arises fact people hear “vaccine soon” act little recklessly. realistically system overloaded lot places, many get vaccine many months. 

Unfortunately, due semblances controls put place, many die vaccine even twinkle eye. People act like 1% population dying blasé. It’s sickening delete this. K. Psh, vaccines duhhh vaccinate least 10% wait 2 weeks see result. might see upward growth slows bit. probably one peak coming next two weeks following New Year spreading. One super spreader event Super Bowl Sunday. peak hospitalizations probably around 140-145 thousand.

By early March start see real declines cases. Immunity infection near 40 percent immunizations another 15 percent. 

we might surprised quickly things get better April May. lost half million including 150000 vaccine sight I'd making choice well. Easier say do, course, feel lucky daughter 12 months, even realize missing meeting kids. think people understand herd immunity means. people hear/read want hear/read. Maybe both.

Herd immunity minimum level need achieve get back normal. like said, happen vast majority people vaccinated. Sorry hear. definitely struggle. hope hang return normalcy (or semblance it) near future. least, getting things like gyms restaurants back summer big help mental states. realize vaccine isn’t 100% cure right? 95% effective. aren’t 95% level till get second shot one shot gives 50% effectiveness. means even vaccinated still 5% chance getting virus spreading it. someone vaccinated dangerous place could surrounded group kids. even vaccine kid doesn’t contracts school parent still 5% chance contracting COVID it’s likely higher percent exposed someone day day basis. 


The vaccine saving grace. still need wear masks practice social distancing long heavy majority (or children case) don’t receive vaccine. hate burst peoples bubble 2021 going different 2020, vaccine isn’t going change much. time right now, find morning. number seen reported 8% alternative?

It's awesome actually see progress NY making. family skipped never go anywhere. got days ago. arm really sore days (much flu shot, lifting hurt quite bit) pretty sleepy day, may love naps. that, issues. I’ve heard second dose worse, I’m worried.  Obviously, purpose conversation, think use “immune” fine no? Y’all different shopping habits do.

I feel like missing out. It’s grade 3 again. Yep model used 70% assumption knew efficacy.  Imagine if, know sounds crazy, non-essential workers stayed home. Maybe could help? God. lost tamale hook up. Miss them. Nope, I'm pretty sure GPs UK. Maybe GP clinics people get vaccinated - i.e. vaccines kept couple days. Pfizer vaccine last week refrigerated I'm wrong.   Anywhere 3-8 days average, still definitely quarantine full 14 days known contact someone tested positive point, you’re still anti-mask, you’re probably making wise decisions shouldn’t office. refer covid jail, cocooning, yeah.

Crazy thing vaccines supposed come 12-18 months earliest. Look articles March/April Fauci hinting strongly 18 months approval best case scenario. thinking realistically late summer-early Fall 2021 approval distribution that.

What actual fuck plan? Seems like one looking forward 1-2 months. ""Cases rising, looks bad me, enact restrictions now."" Okay, we're operating assumption vaccines Fall 2021 delaying inevitable.

Bad policy got bailed extraordinary science, yet politicians act like holding vaccine save good policy. Meanwhile took zero initiative testing programs, contact tracing, innovative population-level public health measures, relying personal responsibility closing businesses instead proactive measures. Source effectiveness figures? I've read 95%+ previously. I'm central TX, probably pretty similar thing here. vaccine takes ~10-14 days start working, fully effective fourteen days second dose, delivered wo weeks first. people going hospital today generally infected seven fourteen days ago. 

The first vaccine doses administered Dec. 14th. Technically, first person get vaccinated still protected three days. Obviously, natural processes, follow rigid timetables.

The hospitalization numbers today reflect partial immunity first wave vaccination. hospitalization numbers much lower 4-6 weeks, reflecting large amount vaccination taking place today. [There new variants virus effect vaccination somewhat masked worse virus. Brazilian

*You guys getting vaccines?* got first dose vaccine today! 🙄 Seemingly young healthy people also ending hospitals due covid. wouldn’t say it’s “unfortunate” protect people putting lives risk 10 months... doesn’t fit “Florida bad” narrative though. previously posted, KN95 equivalent N95. different rating system, intended medical use. record number people got vaccine, sufficiently high number cause type drop we're seeing (roughly 15 million Americans taken flu vaccine year last year time.. that's lot, less 5% population). Inter-seasonal variations flu vaccine effectiveness far impactful 5% difference uptake rates result 99%+ reduction seasonal flu load. vast, vast majority change due differences human behavior (work home, social distancing, mask wearing, etc). *despite* fact many Americans still behaving recklessly (unlike OP, assuming truthful - going outside walk picking food/groceries reckless). 

For situation OP described, risk absolutely de minimis - others. figures provided support that. 

Given flu vaccine seasonal anyways, OP take next year. like forgoing permanent immunity flu. Based relative prevalence OP's stated behavior situation, risk OP would gotten COVID trip pharmacy probably greater likelihood get flu entire season given current flu rates. 

Seriously, public health hills die on. COVID one them. Complaining someone primarily isolation (besides occasionally going walk) flu season completely decimated COVID-related precautions one hills die on. know we'll vaccine. want kids catch we've lockdown much harder most, know much longer keep it.

Lol, make look insensitive, makes look like asshole.

Hows Venezuelas socialism comparison? understand perfectly fine, like said, OP fundamentally misunderstanding point vaccine. social normality *byproduct* risk, able spread virus. NOTHING old people prioritized social events, old people prioritized vaccine *because* they're higher risk, thus receiving vaccine sooner equals return social normality sooner.

OP directly implying old people pre-covid freedoms restored *HE/SHE* cannot *his/her* social freedoms restored. Imagine telling cured paraplegic cannot walk paraplegics get surgery walk. maybe selfish attitude ever read site, believe me... lots.

OP cares spreading virus superficially, wants return normality risk contracting carrying virus, he's going end spreading virus, turn kill old people high-risk people, exactly his/her reason going now.

We know vaccination = freedom, question everyone needs ask themselves, worth saving old/high-risk people cost MINOR social impediment marginal amounts time compared vaccine-prioritized?

Either OP truly care, thought all. True, many immunocompromised people get benefits. Maybe Doro meant people.

We herd immunity coronaviruses cause common cold, circulate time adults regularly get reinfected (and suffer little sniffles). reinfections presence natural immunity generated childhood hypothesized keep immunity throughout lives.

Adults wear masks community spread point safe to. lot stores union? included existing collective bargaining agreement something need negotiate labor. retailers get away unilateral decisions, union grocers not. important distinction made listening Covid podcasts talking employers requiring it. Incredible already case almost year on. happy longer work Morrisons, longer live UK. beggars belief. Arnold, please talk Bruce. Hint: US. mean “lifelong complications” little quantitative data for? Apparently know Lifelong complications Covid even year started spreading. Care point real scientific study talking *lifelong* Covid effects? Right now, that's actually likely Moderna, Pfizer close second (a allergic reactions Pfizer. small sample size, however, still could bad luck pegs maybe little pronounced)

In end, however, I'll end taking what's offered, which, depending phase actually end tho, likely J&amp;J approved. I'm estimating general population rollout Well article title says Bolsonaro trust! /s Could done March 2020, people proposed shouted “racist” “xenophobic”. 

Missed opportunity.  Yeah, think people forget variants coronavirus, influenza, stuff like even mono cause things. People get quite sick without Covid-19 Pfizer, least, reach 50% 14 days first dose, max efficacy 95% 7 days SECOND dose. Second dose administered 3 weeks first, total 4 weeks reach max efficacy. 

Moderna doses 4 weeks apart, max 14 days second dose (6 weeks total).

Vaccines shown prevent serious disease, whether prevent infection asymptomatic carrier state studied. unless know endangering anybody (elderly parents, inlaws - friend's/contact's), need continue masking. could still catch it, pass on, cause serious disease someone vulnerable. Tomorrow. Meet behind alley. Bring money pop tarts. People getting twice necessarily bad thing. fact, paper came ***Science*** today suggesting SARS-CoV-2 might end behaving like **every coronavirus causes common cold**, say practically everyone gets primary infection young age intermittently gets reinfected throughout adulthood **but reinfections cause severe disease** due residual immunity childhood, fact reinfections actually critical maintaining immunity (sorta like **natural booster shots**).

Source: it’s controversial enough I’ll read article. I’m giving scummy sites ad revenue. Easy call doctor...  New Year's Eve, outbreak local cases found Victoria, 3 new locally acquired cases detected. grew 28 next week, last case detected 7 days ago now.

Through contact tracing isolation, cases confined attended initial seeding event (which occurred 10 days first case detected), plus close contacts household settings. One case also detected without clear link rest; thankfully, seem onwards transmission. outbreak genomically linked outbreak New South Wales, however chain transmission/index case identified. disagree. People 45 65 years old make 12% deaths. Younger people 45 make 4%. That's big enough difference, opinion. think hard (and slow) target people varying conditions. might well open everyone point. 1 year late interesting!! really hoping place would institute idea like this. course much spread occurs people wearing masks all, mixing socially etc fascinating observe there's appreciable downturn spread. man international treasure protected costs.  saying know sure applies different doses time periods? 

Could give 1/10th dose see immune response know works? so, immediately 10 times many doses!  sound right. Let's say US tests 10% whole population trial duration, means every trial participant test positive asymptomatic, average 9 asymptomatic tested. make data extremely misleading. Slowly turning around car. 

What may realize one dose isn’t going cut it. Referring “British virus” racist could stigmatize British people Good. fucking exceptions Good grief mean, AstraZeneca pulled shady shit idk. broke rules, asked nicely provided mask...showed compassion, lock endangering others...total waste human being.  I'm pretty sure would screaming open 43 daily cases anywhere else. China screaming lock down.  Nobody saw coming 60-70% figure outdated depends reproductive number probably lower real number (people thinking target closer 80-90%).

That said, herd immunity necessarily end goal. Endemicity seems inevitable, becomes roughly dangerous common cold due largely infecting children relatively mild.  arbitrarily making line? 45 age typically thought higher risk age factor deadly virus transmissible. prioritize thay specific age group people could severely limit transmissions? people infected. aren’t challenge trials population also grew now... would funny wasn’t sad year ago... remember formula guy Twitter figured accurately provide reported China numbers days weeks advance? posted whole spreadsheet future dates 99% correct. days handful “cases”. Numbers lie. correct answer.

Chances ""regular folk"" going receive J &amp; J vaccine. mRNA vaccines going reserved essential workers / major risk severe COVID. great, bad looks. apples oranges comparing number 95% Moderna Pfizer. measures symptomatic disease whereas asymptomatic.

I'll part get shot contribute heard immunity can't get one, certainly shutting indoors perpetuity.  allergies would never able leave house case. think point is, people selfish going care vaccinated---especially vulnerable MOSTLY protected. 20-40 year olds going care buddy gets it---and ton buddies already anyways USA Trump mild case? guess I’d call moderate case. Fever 102, absolutely wrecked far energy/nausea/appetite. Fever four days, lost taste smell days that, tired three weeks. taste smell five weeks. Agreed. told murderer human urge interact others bound negative effect people. say going go pick stuff Target someone respond ""IS WORTH LIFE"" fucks you. year two later virus evolves way defeat vaccine we're back start COVID-22. great news! many people anaphylaxis reactions vaccine? number there? Phew can’t believe prioritizing teachers older folks 60 higher risk severe illness death. teachers aren’t even teaching right now! Give risk. Hope get soon! entire royal family lizard people, basically immortal First vaccine developed GERMAN COMPANY GERMANY invested hundreds million tax money!
And countries get WAY vaccines. Ridiculous. oh yeah completely agree sucks fix would require UBI, universal insurance could help assume disabled = cant work.

in case cost living job would bankrupt me, could continue job years otherwise tried Brazil coronavirus China. order trial work need virus spreading lot infect control group. Quote Jurassic Park, friend. Nature always finds way. So...


-All deaths tragic.

-However, adding 400,0000 deaths COVID particularly tragic mostly kills old people going die soon anyway?

I invite walk someone 82 tell last years life matter. See appreciate it. 

We talk starvation accidents much they're unfortunately normal thing. novel, transmissible cause death. course going get attention. old people think matter rapidly fill hospitals prevent younger people matter getting best care. deny care anyone 82 interfere medical treatment young?

I agree we're asked sacrifice awful lot protect lives elderly, quite simple unless want label everyone certain age useless eater something.  solution would keep vaccinating entire population every 6 12 months

Only vaccine stops functioning 12 months. know long vaccines effective. comes fact know yet whether vaccine prevents transmission.

I sure hope does, know. doesn't, big problem. contagiousness always biggest threat virus, mortality rate. comments thread ""yeah, whatever, back normal I'm vaccinated."" half country that, half still waiting get vaccinations, really fuck latter.

The rational approach err side caution, actually know whether prevents transmission. Weight loss simple long term. formula true, that's answer problem even close. compare obesity financial debt, saying spend less earn, although true, helping anyone. know we’re focusing efficacy, AZ vaccine prevented severe Covid symptoms 100% got it. Even efficacy lower Pfizer Moderna, prevents severe Covid symptoms require hospitalizations still game changer. 

It hopefully free healthcare system, reason go lockdowns for. trying selfish, want best vaccine get. stepmother, 78, NYC, happy get 1/21 vaccine date Mt Sinai Hospital, said easy get it(to put mildly), another shot three weeks later, finally fly Florida place here, told keep wearing mask anyway best jeans. :D  getting second dose using incorrectly. “Life Free Die” - New Hampshire predicted future. idea current undercount might be? Good question, honestly I'd assume except cases like elderly homes cant leave easily? perhaps, extreme cases. 

Full disclosure, dont really know, next time talk health care provider insurance agency, would ask them. They'll probably solid information, especially based location, anyone else give you. 

Good luck stay safe, friend. 5,000 football fans packed popular boulevard Tuscaloosa University Alabama 18th college football national championship Monday night, ignoring city’s pleas game stay home inflaming worries influx coronavirus cases city already straining contain pandemic. scene street bars restaurants known Strip precisely health officials wanted avoid .

Are stable genius good genes?  widespread transmission, seems really rigorous contract tracing happening places like South Korea, good data surface (fomant) transmission, especially new variant. doctors saying big risk big risk originally feated, without data even can't sure. playing safe. Lol even win first time. personal opinion isn’t backed evidence yet majority people vaccinated, would make sense wear PPE haven’t you’re around high risk people. Million Mandalorian March D.C. mention best health care existence. It’s really bad idea supplies month. lockdown per se someone household got covid? one bring stuff. 2 options. Option A) go get stuff anyway. B) deal nothing :0 neither good options month thin understand. It’s 3-6 month even year supply preppers going way overboard Pure nepotism, said. Someone family pulled strings.  talking weeks, sure.

But situation Canada running day two next shipment arrives, weekly.

Going full speed 2 days empty 5 simply possible. takes time resources establish high performance supply chain, can't turn whim.

Ontario getting 80,000 doses Pfizer every week, 135,000 doses moderna every 3 weeks.

Sure moderna used fast possible, Pfizer better given steady pace around 12,000 day. 2 million day puts us actual herd immunity mid june late june (give take dose #2), right?

That’d great Use Bluevine. Apply matter think. keep hearing people seem misunderstood confused language rules. Also, rules constantly chance usually direction looser.

Use Bluevine, can't stress enough, fast easy deal versus Fundera others NOTHING help kept emailing Bluevine already gotten business PPP loan. Finally good news godforsaken virus reasons believe numbers coming Florida reported accurately.

Literally one know would without financial compensation would caves sampling bats Yunnan, 1000km away. Trust India almost everywhere bars restaurants open. trust numbers. India shitshow. Somehow number deaths high actually prefer smaller concerts anyway. feel like get really close performer. Larger concerts fun, likely going sit far away stadium arena. completely agree! However, healthcare workers miss work *way* immediate threat running people provide food. Hence (at least area) essential workers included next phase HCW 75+. Regardless, way many vaccines going unused right going arms every minute possible. Hell yeah....2021...giving 2020 middle finger. goin in! 8 deaths though.   don’t think way it. Forcing people getting vaccinated make hardline. I’ll never understand people want take draconian measures force someone something clearly don’t want without considering don’t want automatically assuming know what’s best them. assuming know what’s best really churns gear’s too. better approach educate anti vaxxers take necessary steps soothe concerns.

Medical science moving astonishingly fast  Ehh watching NHL playoffs seem abnormal even watching WJC felt way, different enough detract sport. understanding vaccine manufacturing slowly ramping abundance doses Canada get more. Right slow targeted. glance thought said ""Daily Covid Cases rise 1.25m"" that's news I'm used point. source speculation. New Strand Covid resistant vaccine: Hello worries. Neat book? No, begins day 12 first shot.

[pfizer phase military distributing provincial delivery points. provinces get public  Yeah fuck that, don’t deserve vaccines bigger proportion anybody Well, plan moving miserable area I've lived entire life. hard meet anyone taken age 21 years old anyway.  Canada ordered vaccines Summer (before almost countries) hedge bets. late Oxford vaccine 4th Pfizer 3rd Moderna.  


The reason getting lots immediate doses Pfizer Moderna manufacturing Canada produce vaccines. rely countries. vaccines produced states used states. Thus getting Pfizer vaccines Belgium Moderna vaccines Switzerland. Moderna/Pfizer honour contracts put Canada front line. also want fair give doses help countries ordered them.

Canada also make huge investments funding vaccines, ordered doses. means receive priority. 

US/UK ordered vaccines early, put huge amounts money development vaccine manufacturing. 

Israel paid extra, online registry, special agreement Pfizer share information essentially phase 4 mega-trial. Israel could trusted vaccinate fast efficiently information could help countries. 

Canada way spread efficient country although regions starting ramp BC new vaccines administer tomorrow. BC administering 6K per day next shipment 48,080 probably come Friday (that last week's shipment came). need average 3,900 vaccinations per day meet January allotment. 5 million people. February March need average 9K 11K vaccinations per day, easily scalable current rate time have. Expect production ramp April start see mass vaccinations. right slow, targeted approach. numbers say anything kids bit allergies wrong. see numbers stop reading? I'm worried wife. gives birth March studies breastfeeding getting vaccine probably year getting vaccine. Super Bowl parties?

Yep. outbreaks common staple good thing. get athletes vaccinated see Olympics go see possible house thousands athletes enclosed ecosystem vaccinations. see viral vector vaccine ""traditional."" Sinovac traditional vaccine.  America. Deal it. Lol think they'll figure possible, altho clearer cdc data coming thru least weeks now. there's much going right incomprehensible volumes information complete thorough analysis audit virus' true toll may unknown return ""normal""  Maybe, maybe not
This little peice shit journalism prove anything either way. government controlled single party again. Scary thought. believe you, reference numbers? bet places like Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Missouri, etc. see regular concerts summer. Places like California still lockdown rate. concerts Democrat run states. California/Washington/Oregon probably last places reopen concerts. opinion, way Canadian military.

I thought plan originally? get deleted dumb fuck. Hello, Mr. McConaughey. think there's evidence Moderna one does, specifically studied trials. That's unclear. 

Most likely, vaccine significantly reduce transmission. there's developing countries like South Africa hoping get 20 million vaccines middle year. Damn Carl Weathers’ character Mandalorian cook stew point. Missed opportunity... thought vaccine works? impression general population also get vaccines mass vaccination centers. done vaccinating healthcare elderly, stand less empty anyway huge capacity vaccinate masses. lockdowns completely gone July 4th would floored. still end sight. want able go baseball games summer weird OK isn’t bottom. someone lives SF ED worker, sucks family members workers left criteria.  Hi! Thanks reminder. I’m looking Pfizer data right now, study 42,000 individuals, 21k receiving vaccine, zero serious adverse events found.

That’s kind you’re going concerned regards long term side effects; they’ll first present within weeks vaccination (being primarily autoimmune nature) sufficiently serious could last significantly longer. fact found zero actually makes difficult compute exact percentage risk, rudimentary parameter estimation, probability *any* serious adverse effect probably going order less 1 20,000 (and likely considerably lower, seeing would likely detect least one around there). bear mind — that’s going always long term condition, though certainly could be.

Compare that, contrast, risk serious adverse events COVID-19 infection; risk *way* higher, probably order percentage points slightly lower; even low-risk groups, risk serious adverse events going considerably higher virus vaccine.

I don’t Moderna binder me, memory, it’s similar nearly identical.

I realize placing conservative upper bounds risk probably isn’t definitive you’d want, sorry — it’s best stats background given zero cases serious adverse events.

Hope helps! 400 odd million spread across major vaccines. hedging possibility one vaccines working out. Better many eggs baskets few. Americans bogarted majority supply. Bit closer that, 17km..? pre-COVID? personally think I'd rather cold twice year like normal people around think I'm strange using paper towels doors. future probably stigma, trade everything, even make much sense. idea downvoted here. speaking literal truth. ""vaccinate 18 year old grocery bagger 68 year old obese retiree diabetes"" virtue signaling best ridiculous worst. goal vaccine priority *always* reduce number deaths. never reducing spread. somewhere back April, *everyone* became ""essential worker"", ""essential workers"" get mad suggest people *actually* risk virus get vaccine them. die Olympics, either happening year wont see summer games 2024. got mine today Texas! expected first dose? go outside live normally right though? woman tell *to face* someone ""knew"" (who conveniently lived another state) child die car accident death certificate said COVID. Thanks explaining. guess wasn’t clear snowbird (didn’t know foreign). aren’t big thing region.  Nothing like anecdotal evidence prove point! simple. Reduce need hospital beds reasoning lockdowns (reducing strain healthcare system) goes away.

Yes, there's still pandemic restrictions would go away, enough doses yet cover essential workers makes sense vaccinate vulnerable. also allows vulnerable rejoin society stimulate economy. worry people 20s immunocompromised, dying even worried COVID. They're already going bars nightclubs open, even though terrible idea. Yep. People keep claiming we're hiding cases/underreporting - I'm saying necessarily true extent - explain hospitals tons beds available, etc. much want virus also first line vaccine offered people like me, chance vaccines work? trust science looking Israel's numbers numbers still come much would expected to. 

UK seeing surge cases deaths new variant vaccinations pretty high. lag reporting must take account? sake millions people who's immune systems compromised take vaccine would still wear masks good chunk globe vaccinated  cockroach problem since Obama? 

Might worth bug bombing it. also would primarily affect regions came from, state reserve National Guard call upon, like DC taking everyone around country. cannot shame people. holiday focus people getting vaccinated, thanking medical professionals, kids dressing like sanitation workers, doctors scientists. r/woosh Exactly. People know why, aren’t anything Pretty scary...

Let's hope really works see people dropping dead randomly year... think you’re really misreading OPs comment. Point they’re trying make think, we, less risk, didn’t stop going seeing friends/family, normal things still allowed, limiting lives ahead us priority get things first still stuck restrictions. (Since lower risk begin with)

I don’t like large crowds period really people general time, personally don’t care read comment. fear virus may crossover species elephant mutate something unstoppable vaccine cleaning masking slow stop thus causing mass extinctions  definitely China November don’t think tells us much all. understand. waiting for? totally get that. much I've somewhat enjoying WFH, major drawback able go anywhere breaks. even work.

Sometimes even want sleep bedroom anymore feel like I've day need sleep living room slight change scenery. WFH's got pros cons.

Congrats baby btw! :) incorrect End jan let know soon enough. Stay safe keep warm [There's lot unpack there. Many distance runners athletes worse go post viral effects despite mild surprise you, fit person, feel effects myocarditis someone works daily largely average. fact, I'd say aware body feels people earth distance runner.

Chinese Sinovac vaccine 50% effective. Almost 30 percentage points lower previously announced. seems reasonable, think immunocompromised people (people certain medical conditions) age able get elderly. relief afterward real Moderna's trials severely lacking inadequate. means effectively nothing me.  downvote this. 9 millions plus increasing fast. Stop negative shit.   Lol, lanyards legal backing. I'm Bavarian honestly think make difference. wear FFP2 masks shopping anyways. Nice! Good know rural folks warming idea getting vaccinated. make whole lot sense either, I'm expert think criticism help. 

The weather nice today. cat likes me. vaccination roll smooth could be, people getting vaccinated. might well stress it. :) I've saying years: conspiracy theories vote confidence nation's elites.

When someone endorses conspiracy theory, they're saying ""I believe powerful people country (politics, business, media) terrible job explanation trying hard general population"".

When conspiracy theories become common, need taken seriously. Instead treating symptom (debunking theory itself), need treat root cause mistrust. Yup, unique coronaviruses either. Random mutations occur time nature reproduction. viruses' reproduction rate much higher say, rabbits. mutations add quickly, RNA viruses makes mutations easier occur.

This mean variations released world though. rarely. even takes new strain mutated selective advantage already existing strains passing population something like UK strain show compete everything else. Butantan running trial says right headline, lol.

They ones saying stuff Sinovac.

The efficacy severe cases 100% tend die probably effectively protected vaccine. What? COVID-19 approximately 6 weeks. Much longer typical course disease particular chronic. legend shall survive Yes he’s national treasure!! guarantee anywhere close number Yeah I'd say old fuck got salary regardless. totally am, need roll vaccines faster get restrictions eased life feel normal again.  sure problem variant, ineffective.

I first baby March right everything shut down, carrying normal - work home taking care baby. 

HOWEVER, one thing kept balanced working home years ability go things lunch break - run errands, grab food, go browse store. could physically mentally take break. shut downs, completely window, especially infant tow.

In England health advice children 3 wear mask safety reasons (I guess less able take mask could breathing difficulties), 11 required wear mask actively discouraged wearing one. Thats absolutely case. people hardline antivaccers, suspicious quick timeline. see people lives getting vaccinated fine they'll definitely change minds quickly. another reason need vaccinate haste! wonder error,

Can somebody shed light this? ""efficacy"" definite meaning? thought meant ""The vaccine prevents positive PCR test"" i.e ""if get vaccine, even exposed positive""

Brazil something lines of, ""Sinovac said us, patient needs show least 1-2 symptomps count positive case.""

If ""efficacy"" standards same, compare numbers vaccine numbers vaccines? people tested positive wearing masks assume, since first person mentioned says chastising others wearing masks seige. Goes show people, masks one hundred percent stopping virus, furtheremore, exists new contagious variants, best stay home much well get best mask can, wear correctly go out. get example seconds Pfizer shot couple days say 22 23 first dose, likely efficacy? imagine there's much data it. Biden's team already announced intend release second doses idk would reverse now. Sorry, thought meant Pfizer Moderna known asymptomatic cases left data. you’re talking unknown potential asymptomatic cases, we’re agreement Usually happens aroun 4:30pm EST Cuz Reddit picks chooses celebrities wanna worship.

That’s going happen, human race stupid learn. evidence yet contrary. one things medical experts simply want give misinformation. said, asymptomatic cases spread rapidly vaccines *do* prevent spread, reasonable covid vaccine greatly reduce transmission.

Members Congress know better though. I've found another source, Imperial College London. Variant affecting 20s original. problem didn’t give facts did. said fine you’ll fine. Clotted cream!!! That's called!! I'm virtually hugging sending kisses able eat relatives bring US come back trip Mexico. ♡♡♡♡ Lol. 21st month? Damn long go. looking approval sometime February then. keep mind something like short term. US people access soon, anit-vaxxers disadvantaged.  see lot people saying ""COVID never over."" mean ""There big gatherings ever everyone wear masks,"" mean ""We're gonna vaccinated every wear mask feel sick.""? helps, genuinely surprised small needle was! Definitely smaller needle one use institution flu shots. I'm one people that's terrified needles. Yeah u/Job_williams1346 burden find good news Florida

&amp;#x200B;

/s :) amazing around 700,000 day pre administration general public 75 years old. get us least 3,000,000 per day rate time US allows people 75 receive vaccine hopefully around mid March. would mean mid April could see upwards 165 Million people vaccinated first dose. first dose 50% efficacy would basically mean April Covid numbers could pretty small much manageable summer. Meaning states opening meaning, May June - COVID could risky flu average. excites tremendously. thing fear Divided States gets vaccinated people may get complacent 1 1/2 years could come back thats talk another time. alot hope! probably counts onlyfans sex work don’t really feel sorry . least realistic option Hanging around bit standard practice vaccines though. allergic reaction also due Vasovagal syncope good number people get (a whole lot get allergic reactions) 5-15 min poked kind needle. 

Well, least many places. got pneumococcal shot last year told stay pharmacy 30 min. 

I guess authorities could choose skip mass vacc sites, due extraordinary circumstances risky send people way risk passing randomly vagus nerve throws hissy fit blood pressure drops. Ugh author literally one job one important word article. 

Thanks can’t get actual nozzle ?

What someone’s mug makes contact nozzle ? Yeah, us parents do. kind care lot happens kids. did, first time ever (I'm 21) hard getting one apparently many people wanted get regional government order doses.

Edit: European, clarity will, doesn’t symptoms strong man. Problem may infected candidates presidential debates journalists well. lockdown incoming Portugal probably physical presidential campaign. family Long Beach. tested positive (5 them) one household. Good news recovered.

California 39th deaths per capita Florida 25th. gonna get canceled. fooling wasting time, money, effort attempting year. bubble without crowds way happen year, defeats purpose hosting Olympics. now, I'm even sure 2022 sure thing. 2020 might canceled permanently Japan host 2024. statement less reliable people making baseless claims American government shut down, fine, arrest anyone whim?  We’re definitely picking speed now. sure comment section full nice people respect dead. Curious US trial AZ finish? definitely belongs /r/upliftingnews median ages various states? wait dudes can't afford daddy dime. testing death.

Very frustrating liberal nurses doctors checking people's pulses whatnot make us look bad death #'s. Nice! Thanks Well, much time left. Can't imprison entire world much longer without social unrest. cool. love it. Growing 80's grandmother would spend hours days baking bread. time never realized years ago. family reunion aunt talked grandma baked bread (as child) entire village Japanese american war. baked much war continued bake veterans would kids deliver weekly. grandma never spoke remember. remember always telling ""breaking bread strangers create friends become family"". probably left New Years way get rid them.  know sequence genomes US (not enough though). think virus us learn give stupid hope actually deal situation proactive manner, priortizes health individuals maintenance something imaginary like debts. They’re targeting elderly. people scum. end near worst, that's big victory considering factors, like population density, international entry point, etc.

That Still bottom third states deaths per capita nothing short miracle. It’s “first 100 days” popular political slogan, “100 million vaccinations” easy number hit 100 it. 

Seriously. 

That’s policy exists. 100.

These things never “real” policies. They’re catchy slogans build good new administrations. Logistics basically. ER/ICU/Covid personnel got first dose Pfizer already hospitals. Healthcare workers long-term care facilities also get Pfizer 25 central locations across country due storage requirements. Moderna bit easier storage requirements thus administered retirement homes, plus high efficacy elderly. AZ J&amp;J administered later GPs using existing structures flu shots, first people underlying conditions everyone who's left. still free say it, appropriate places talk it. can't walk kindergarten start discussing hardcore porn, get removed. God bless Angeles lifted lockdowns day since March yet worst spot entire fucking world.

Get Mitch Eric Trump cam getting convince republicans get too. believe you, anyone source? Oh man, fingers crossed one. one dose vaccine easier storage temp requirements would huge deal. even made TV series that, Handmade's Tamale. micromanaging vaccine distribution process would better strategy. Strange haiku Pure speculation below:

Probably Pfizer Moderna require 2 doses much cooler temperatures remain stable. Easier make sure groups get second dose long term care facilities working medical fields, far less risk spoilage around medical professionals reaction happens (assumption J&amp;J types reactions - know yet, different types vaccines)

Young healthy people may show second dose feeling fine 'oops, got busy, bad.' give one dose done. Also, since requirements storage much less - easier roll mass vaccinations correct freezer may available.

Another reason may efficacy. Let's say J&amp;J 80% effective vs. Moderna Pfizers roughly 95% second dose. Well, young/healthy people far less likely die Covid, give 80% efficacy vaccines that's plenty good age group. Save 95% much higher risk exposure/death contracted. actually year getting flu shot made least amount sense me. I've working home. kids. mother died year ago father retired, hunkered down, told stay away coast clear. reason leave house one infect go (fully masked) would need flu shot? would even GET flu, let alone pass along? Everything need gets delivered. see one except Zoom. know situation everyone's though, think lot reasons flu vaccine makes sense people. Cool, Fauci endorses this. four vaccine candidates pipeline, ought mean 100 days wearing masks get back normalcy. Deal.

If becomes another ""14 days slow spread"" scenario, I'm never listening Fauci again. 100 days plenty time vaccinate US near herd immunity. know vaccine distribution slow far, really ramp up. refuse lose senior year virus. Kids don’t pay taxes Part reason Israel given huge supply vaccine relative population could produce clinical data world's guinea pigs. *DUH!* Needed today. Definitely political! wife lot science would hope things pretty back normal anyone started 1-11 aged yet talked Mederna far talking it? 95% sub parroting insanely high levels vitamin effective coronavirus. enough evidence prove this.... Oh wow. pretty much it, then. still massively disinfect place moving sake staff Welcome reddit. leans heavily one direction. Derek Lowe retweeted someone talking data released, said would arms, one trial.

Take grain salt, tracks Derek Lowe retweeted someone talking data released, said would arms, one trial.

Take grain salt, tracks Deaths 2020 within 95% confidence interval pre-COVID. I'm sorry disease mainly kills obese elderly people gonna stop society, even left unchecked. Lockdowns failed implement proper one, enforcing proper one literally impossible America. vaccine exists currently rolling out. vaccinate vulnerable 10% population, 90% deaths prevented.

This site good mental health. Stop believing every scary headline read. Dressed Kill one favs read quote voice.

Because exponential growth pretty much correct way think it.

Italy's outbreak roughly 2 months delayed Wuhan, enough doubling times shows virus originated Wuhan Italy. Otherwise come mechanism sat around Italy 2 months nothing population completely naive, later viciously hit epidemic.

I sick moral justice conservatives think right interfere people's business. 

Ask Swedish French sex workers like ""Nordic Model"". Sounds good first, completely fails solve problems creates new ones. don’t know all. People need stop making assumptions. exactly said people complaining never positive articles Florida.

So looked can’t find them. find post then.

It’s complicated. data doesn’t disagree “should gotten it”. never attempted, conclusion draw. country stated planned goal attempting herd immunity. Even Sweden. You’re dishonest. really excited one lmao look cool coronabro 100% correct. I'm pleasantly surprised getting upvoted. California lock lock down, worse Florida wide open amount elderly state.

So many people want draw parallels. even close league. can't even believe I'm reading r/Coronavirus, Doomer central. mean, working sweat shop. it’s work doesn’t mean it’s exploitative.   things aside, data publicly Pfizer Moderna vaccines.

...other Wuhan. Received mine Friday! glad things speeding viruses can't confused available testing.  lol, no. Clearly restrictions work. Maybe virus originate Italy simply took China.

In epidemiology ""he smelt it, dealt it"" default assumption.

One case Italy Nov leading epidemics Feb means virus Wuhan even earlier order Dec epidemic.

Otherwise would need produce reason virus spread much faster Wuhan Italy.

You'll also genetics issues explaining things like spread D614G makes extraordinarily unlikely figure way invert timeline.

In 2013 went holiday 2 days jab 200 mile drive developed migraine unlike anything I've ever before; assumed travelling. 

2014 travelled days jab time train (my preferred method). developed debilitating fatigue holiday - bed 8:30pm instead usual 3 - 4am. bouts fatigue still happen week two randomly times year. also developed horrendous shooting pains bones arms legs felt like red hot spikes driven spells couple minutes time - went 9 months.

I also developed diziness/vertigo daily occurrence best part year still continues happen less frequently - I'm lucky go 6 - 8 weeks without 'attack'.

So yeah flu jab 6 years I'm dreading covid jab. However I'm willing roll dice get even crap last 6 years risk posed covid worse. phrase rock hard place springs mind!  Actually that's Novavax. lowest response, similar Astrazeneca's, least antibodies. difference number antibodies might matter much: Moderna produced significantly antibodies Pfizer's yet efficacy profile.

Also vector vaccines per se less effective: Sputnik V viral vector vaccine +90% efficacy robust data. always irks people like always say I’m oppressed, i’m like you’re asked wear mask?? JFC It´s also different kind approvals granted EMA US, UK etc Im knowledgeable person, gist said deciding encode spike proteins Pfizer they’ve generated pre-fold spikes, therefore overall better polyclonal antibody response captures binds wider breadth spike proteins? Genuinely interested, haven’t heard ANYONE explain depth difference PFE AZ. take heat whole baby powder fiasco Considering applied EU license think release data? im sure case - believe EU countries rely EMA approvals

but even im wrong, criticism overall EU continent country leaders handling this. could hold open borders people travelling europe... must drunk. read message twice read February.... assume may weird translation “british virus” seems awfully unprofessional. first dose tomorrow. I've covid, two weeks hell. I'm looking forward vaccinated. Chance vaccine resistant mutations must also reduced minimum keeping measures long vaccination campaign running.

Afterwards biggest risk come nations like Mexico Brazil virus keep circulating Can’t stop calling things British virus Chinese virus. Lol why? Who's gives fuck think cares you, all? Impossible *this* vaccine *this* disease Fair enough - however criticism EU still valid personally think EU fault.

Every member state capable granting emergency authorization way 29th. Holy moly, none people photo wearing masks. airport! think you’re misreading. He’s trying say decide 29th latest, probably earlier. one mentioned 29th February Here’s crazy idea...keep wearing fucking gas mask.

I’m saying idea applies most, really situations, case literally device designed keep alive biological warfare person...and apparently took off. It’s even less that, 6m people nursing homes account like 40% deaths Valneva still phase 1, expect make change regarding speed achieve herd immunity. doses could probably serve stockpile case annual vaccinations necessary, could offered poorer countries. 

The EU gotten lot criticism lately, rightly so, think anyone expecting contracts one Novavax. We're getting really off-topic may summon wrath ""high-quality information"" moderators. honestly think current situation planet well described approach. think good, fair societal organization exists, would plot current existing systems graph somehow quantifying features, think desired point would anywhere close middle clouds points current countries - view world, would probably completely outside it.

no rush, like there's global crisis anything That’s also huge loss businesses. They’re going realize they’ll make lot money letting everyone in, rather people vaccinated, likely, everyone vaccinated spring. 

Also, people afraid running get vaccinated immediately, probably aren’t ones rush go places, either. Italian newspapers reporting decision taken 29 January. link 29 February stuff?  really reflects normal french behavior really Fair point. I'm US.

My country even refrigerators store Pfizer vaccine, let alone vaccines. neighbouring countries already started process least small amounts them. We'll get we're lucky beginning next month. 

Good thing recieving vaccines later everyone people less sceptical it. I'd say 50% would want get + natural herd immunity we'll returning normal. 30 Million doses EU nothing, EU handling vaccination process travesty Maybe they’re dining French laundry? reply confirms previous comment. 

Let's see, idea respective authorities received data? policies (spoiler: generally rigorous EMA require full instead partial data)? companies file approval (spoiler: much later EMA)? following technical steps? I'm much inclined believe don't, talking nonsense couple random headlines read reddit, like everyone else keeps repeating ""bureaucracy"" trope. one I've checking pandemic. different scenarios projections well. ""Found"" way new cancer treatments found every day, vanish ether, ""found"" ""ready rolled hospitals worldwide""? expensive per dose, keep extremely low temperatures wkll likely save lot money Told guys wear mask plus safe distance other, yet freedom right partying important.
Good luck. 😮 wow Oh well envisaged contract Valneva would provide possibility EU Member States purchase together 30 million doses, could purchase 30 million doses. 

It small amount doses, guess EU wanted bases covered inactivated virus vaccine portfolio. Whole food plant based diet win. Check information science power plants.  now? Should’ve done masks became mandatory. 7 million doses given 1 death versus 23 million coronavirus cases 385000 deaths......... I'll take chances vaccine. Oh man I'll bet there's awesome recipes it. ♥️♥️ course deadlines generous, lol. time less generous deadlines small weekly projects. trying shift blame someone else usual. like Pfizer approval, releasing snarky press note implying British health authorities approved much earlier, data documents always access to, incompetent reckless. among others Germany said ""fuck it, guys better start working"" somehow found way speed things week.

Certainly happening due political pressure members states. Well, one many covid care centres shut due lack patients. Hospitals aren’t overwhelmed either (I dialysis every week major hospital, crowds sick people far see). Plus, would Indians hide dead bodies? Seems like cemeteries US barely cope moment.  Sentence 24 hours ICU mask!  Here's situation government expects Netherlands, note Dutch understandable.

everyone thing anyways. know pfizer's numbers are, moderna, oxford, butantan total zero hospitalisations trials despite vaccinated people still getting virus comment reads like ""deaths evenly distributed"" ""deaths actually slightly lower among elderly populations suggesting."" misinformation case. want correct people, thoroughly. Chiming say ""Ur rong"" adding detail helpful doesnt make look smart might think  Yes Relying others safety good enough get N95 masks protect yourself. casual discourse concerning deadly pandemic. exactly misinformation disinformation spread. Enough doses everyone Q2? good joke There’s like maybe 10 people proven gotten twice. bit allergies wrong

SOURCE PLEASE.

Per state, Minnesota's, reasons someone get vaccinated. person life-threatening reaction previous dose COVID-19 vaccine receive doses. Additionally, person life-threatening reaction ingredient vaccine, vaccinated. People anaphylaxis taking medicines, particularly medicines given injection, may vaccinated observed 30 minutes receiving COVID-19 vaccine.

You also read page this.

Or go itself.

All say thing: anyone 16+ allergic receive vaccine.

The assumption made, could criticized didn't, vaccine equally effective people autoimmune issues conditions, yet data that. However, people allowed receive vaccine.  elderly dumb say vaccine candidates.

Other countries G7 already orders Canada did, countries already front line access pre-orders invested heavily right candidates. (warp Speed, EU, UK) 

Canada covers G7 exception Japan, below. Singapore study, Chinese study *hospitalized* patients Wuhan. nessecarily representative average patient.

While true China hospitalized patients, even symptoms, study specifically looked particlar hospital supposed treat patients seriously ill. mild asymptomatic cases sent makeshift hospital, included study. advocating now! glad finally happening. personally using N95 masks since August. They're cheap readily available. Wrong way round. It’s people use absolute numbers express astonishment relative size without taking total populations account there’s problem.

My government fucking dumb even make crystal clear citizens get vaccine Whitehall official explains: “Ultimately government charge vaccine rollout. It’s Department Health Social Care (DHSC) programme. lead policy NHS leads operational delivery plan. it’s NHS vaccination programme – delivered NHS. who’s responsible it? Ultimately ministers responsible it.”

This literally British government implements every single policy. Obviously foreign policy works differently less operational. really change fact government programme. first off: yes. US 1.2 Million vaccines day, also way low number them, comparing scale Germany far behind

I find pictures looks today there's middle article. No, masks absolutely 100%. cloth masks, even N95s, masks designed biological warfare, would/should 100% effective airborn virus worn correctly. absolutely reusable. washable. got money clout? Here’s info:[Vaccine Covid19 

“Studies shown ~10% people recovered COVID19 weak antibodies wean (it looks like 90 days). antibodies wean off, get reinfected come contact virus again.”

So 10% won’t lasting immunity infection. That’s bit lower I’d previously understood, still impact percentages needed herd immunity. Interesting chart 👍 think really supported science could counter productive.

An evidence review face masks COVID-19:

 Hopefully. Timing right depends outcomes trial. Like Congress, received first vaccine shot. Seems like theory true immunized protected serious disease still contract spread COVID. 2021, please leave Sir David Attenborough alone. well also economy needs schools back session - people can't go work little ones home people working home can't get much done they're helping kids zoom school would choose much available. I'm young healthy, bit ""bullet"" getting 80% instead 90% effective vaccine reach amount heard immunity faster totally worth it. posts allowed previous high-quality updates FHM banned mods? One hope, still uncertain due influence holidays. regular flu cold previous years usually increase afterwards less expected Sars-Cov-2 too. thought updating beliefs based new evidence virtue. Guess I’ll stick old ideas. You’re going get Corona fist bump. see getting ""delay"" from, that's mentioned article  article mention “delaying” shots? Sweden's ever-declining curve strikes again.

Here's deaths reported today date death.

The curve always pointing zero. Actually look link shared, see cases leading deaths.

WHO Worldometers tracks stats real-time reported governments.

Sure sometimes catching mistakes, globally declared deaths previous day. they’re immune compromised wouldn’t almost certainly succumb illness. I’m hard time grasping person’s body still function virus wrecking havoc 5 months. immune system fighting keeps check, enough completely eradicate it? Like legally binding spending commitment (pre-Coronavirus) raise NHS spending £35bn. talking proportion NHS budget goes private providers? looking focusing resources local GP surgeries, pharmacies primary care providers. Gov 101 money often best distributed via people local - rather central bureaucracy. force someone go hospital distribute treatment via local pharmacy administer care local GP? 

UK trains actually pretty efficient, difference UK rest Europe UK passengers pay bulk running cost. Whether agree approach kind moot - way works country. 

Just FYI British Rail utterly shite. almost every metric including: passenger numbers, productivity, number services soaring, customer satisfaction, journey times - trains better. UK frequent long distance short distance trains European country. obvious exceptions...don't get started Southeastern's issues unions.. overall perception reality instance completely odds.. ah, see confused. 

Wearing mask give 100% invulnerability catching COVID. situation would exposed many, many, many viral particles long period time. RemindMe! 3 weeks ""Check late December dip"" knew that. It’s theater. Inventory still huge problem short runway like misleading though since death reporting lags around 3 weeks. data past 3 weeks complete. curve look like death rate constant even increasing. Prisoners option quarantining avoid it. logic shitty flawed, please let know part shitty flawed. 

You're one posting without substance. Trying view world - especially medicine - completely black white fool's errand dutifully carrying out. 

The original parent creating meaningful risk either others taking flu vaccine year. want make cogent argument take it, one think make sure get ""habit"" taking it, matter year, matter future ones. Otherwise, needlessly shaming them.

I can't wait get COVID vaccine, take flu vaccine every year. elderly in-law die flu-induced pneumonia recognize seriousness disease. think shaming someone acting perfectly rationally context year his/her risk factors productive public health discussion, delusional far harm good. One biggest challenges encouraging positive public health behaviors psychological reactance stoking completely unnecessarily. That's bad :( 

So UK variant give less severe COVID like seemed beginning (and already contagious add even stress healthcare systems). Canadian don’t need pump numbers high states. 328 mil vs 38 mil population. stop ten? They’re probably politically motivated say doesn’t work. Actual science irrelevant. Come on!  Faster faster 125 people back work place today, big boss stood outside door temp checks FIST BUMPING least 50% employees coming in. bumped back. told ""no thanks maybe months!"" said ""AHhh cmon"" 

Wtf! That's kind weird post. Number absolute trash.

I thought army going help rollout, Don?

It’s like people get sick due lack real attempt planning. current distribution situation like Canada invaded United States and, instead federal government mounting coordinated military response, dumped truckloads guns steps North Dakota statehouse said ""good luck"". People already use throwaway mask several times, put pockets, take out, touch etc... what's point mandating masks almost nobody's gonna use correctly? Awesome pictures article. Thanks! Mate, can't keep massive socially, economically mentally damaging lockdowns restrictions unknown risk health problems mostly anecdotal evidence . Kids need play normally, go school etc risk far pales, me, keeping child home/socially distanced. there's little risk spreading adults, course week ago people saying ""If vaccinate 500k per day, gonna take two years vaccinate everyone!""

Numbers go up. Chill. someone living Japan, I’m completely happy fact call Japanese variant instead Brazilian.

Why? virus, sports team. Price-gouging? One best deals world current costs. mask keeping social distancing situations world ending you? Get fuck here.

For 2 years more? Yeah, fuckin is. Sorry, sorry. I'm hoping herd immunity, Mom, Dad, Grandma vaccinated large percentage total adult population, mean leave house earlier July. Surely even kids vaccinated adults vaccinated mean community spread low enough. holding back second dose federal level

Is got article? really see said. Nowhere say feds would releasing stock 2nd doses states.


Here's saw: implication feds never really holding second dose back.  Azar telling states stop holding back 2nd doses? feds holding back, no, manufacturing deliver time.

I mean, would explain lot regarding many doses sitting shelves states: knew feds waiting production meet 2nddose gap want get caught lurch. Well would really helpful research find doses actually are.

They say 1 million given talked one guy 24,000.

Well get start tracking others down? vials reportedly unique codes specifically tracked. transit? freezers? someone deliberately holding back everyone's 2nd dose?

There 227 hospitals giving shots, reportedly CVS, Walgreens, Publix chains well. Let's say 500 locations, send 2000 shots one 1 million shots. Maybe stored location waiting administered.

The rollout Florida seems hopelessly inadequate. giving like thousand per day. sites 75 100 appointments day. need get next order magnitude.  Today's reported deaths happened 3-5 weeks ago. look back mid-December, hit new high. always dip last 3-5 weeks. Check December 15th-30th dip February 3rd, better picture December. According CDC estimates reckon flu vaccinations amongst adults higher season last saying higher uptake amongst flu vaccines sole reason. doubt social distancing/covid restrictions played apart since flu contagious covid flu much chance spread like usual years. I'm sure higher uptake flu vaccines also played small part record low flu cases phenomenon also found happen influenza. Yes obviously. need 1 specialist/doctor multiple jabbers doesn’t start immediately.

You literally order anything online, include masks even groceries. Oxford one? 

Well far know, even Pfizer ModeRNA guarantee protection infections disease. It’s still possible asymptomatic (or cases mildly symptomatic) carrier vaccinated. 

Same Oxford, except likely experience symptoms. three however effective hospitalisation deaths (which need stop overloading healthcare system).

But welcome choose whatever vaccine want.... it’s really you. delaying means going extend 2-3 week period 1st 2nd, unless misunderstand meaning ""delay"" We've heard lot big pharma want responsible adverse impacts, think unreasonable ""be afraid"". According past peak infections. makes sense reassuring see models reflecting it. immunity lasted 90 days, we'd seeing incredible numbers reinfections, reality, staggeringly rare. hear that, think people disappointed new normal look like covid largely control- industries communities devastated. someone living Japan, I’m completely happy fact call Japanese variant instead Brazilian.  meta-analysis covid IFR studies.
World Health Organization, varies hospital example Cleveland Clinic site it: certain high-risk medical conditions risk severe illness COVID-19. includes individuals obesity, cancer, COPD, chronic kidney disease, immunocompromised state, heart conditions, sickle cell disease, pregnancy, Type 2 diabetes. **If 65 years old, need order provider.**

Note: I'm sure pregnancy listed since tested yet make rules possible one situations either stick arm someone throw vaccine away. people first group refusing take vaccine. Moderna vaccine strict rules handled. take vaccine box basically used thrown out. whole media blowing new strains way proportion, whole world back Stage 1 treatments vaccines useless now. Even actual doctors trying calm people moment. Roll Damn COVID? read words record COVID much lately assumed terrible news almost scrolled right by. small welcome relief. trial well.

Yes, covid19 title=panic x2 that’s grandma’s do! mom used bake service advisor took car service take tamales Christmas. Still really matter, people vaccinated better. really seems like CA made complex necessary I'm wrong. N95 filter lot more. basic knowledge. think nurses covid patients using cloth masks? use n95. doubt anything deep, think pretty clearly particular political leader touted miracle cure, certain leader tends followers can't accept basic fact evidence hits face. what’s happened father?   death rate per capita several times higher Nordic neighbours lower several European countries opted lockdowns.

Almost primary reason difference bunch factors too? Immunish? good N95, research shows effect much better nothing Total demand available however, administered what's distributed. supply greater there'd sitting shelf. get point administered 100% have, supply issue, excuse. Fish rots head. twist lyme disease. mean, getting shot, else going show? feedback great!

We Time enough change it, failed!

Now, together Pandemic get even harder People whole Infrastructure broken.

I sure Covid-19 related Friends get much higher Deathtoll thinking Aftermath Crisis. Good point good mutations. article even says 1.25m figure includes weekend catch-up. Actual new vaccinations 700k, i.e., still well targeted pace. Let’s go 16 million get with. Probably 350,000 - 400,000, given Israel vaccinated 22% population, almost 2 million Palestinians. Though perhaps somewhat less given Israeli Palestinian population overall less eager get vaccinated compared secular Jewish population (orthodox Jews also problematic regard). What? get from? basing human trial vitro lab study. human trial, doses normal. Took forever find buried annoying google results: link lot informative second. read someones post Facebook said knew someone heard happened somebody's brother time plan order make work better last summer.

Yes, could better (a lot vaccine done lot faster), contend current effort failure. even close. getting faster medical professionals get procedure sorted out. People want believe cure aren’t using idea weird multifaceted virus kill people regardless stage prevent and/or treat infections.  

I think it’s rooted desire avoid sense helplessness makes us uncomfortable, combined sense responsibility one another makes us accountable shift actions good others. 

When combine false idea haven’t looking “cheap” solutions bug pharma (we have, see use cheap steroids) makes us always find loophole hopes get dashed again. People using cloth surgical masks almost nothing. People using n95 masks. government lying people saying anything good not. might vary region, think point states longer counting multiple tests separate. Fact check Ohio: 

**""What happens person takes multiple tests? tests added person's case file; new separate cases,** health department spokeswoman Melanie Amato told Enquirer. "" lot overlap since already confirmed cases sent back line. much COVID-19 vaccine cost? acceptable why?

Israel - country 10% population way less resources already crossing 2 million vaccinated mark, already vaccinating 50+ population. Germany boasts vaccinated already 600k always liked Marcus believe 1947 entire metro area NYC (~6m) able vaccinated small pox less month. come florida get shots here, that's seniors already :(

I want vax ya'll short answer is, ""Yes.""

A longer answer is: 
 

1. RNA-based replication, nature, already highly mutagenic. Every single replication opportunity transcription errors (aka, mutations). Every single person infected contribute countless new copies virus, least non-zero number mutations.
2. mutations good us. Weaker, less contagious, less lethal. bad mutations generate 1.1.7.B, new Russian strain, likes. Yes Sure. That's they're trying do. problem demand great. people die, though. Deaths often slow lingering. small chance, know. hey temp fate? initial 3% case fatality rate, 2,%. infection facility rate 1,5% beginning, 0,1-0,2% countries. flu, people immunity, explains deaths flu. 70 years age risk dying 0,05%. someone try tell flu cases reported COVID hospitals get money that's there's record low flu cases.

This makes way sense though... argue going lot time might bring up. Viruses *do* tend spread less people near use proper hygiene lol. friend scheduled vaccine week, gave yesterday said extras. work went quiet, told people back January pretty bad already trying keep distance cleaning everything touched. said wasn’t worth flu. almost year later since things shut down, working home. San Diego, CA set “Vaccination Super Station” Petco Park goal vaccinate 5,000 people daily. district ALONE. 

So stoked! bad USA. People walking around piece cloth face goes basically almost nothing. Everyone needs using n95 Hell, I'd say expect 2022. situation serious. can't afford superspreader event happening every time maskhole science denier Alabama decides *has* go see Kid Rock Five Finger Death Punch unmasked bug still floating around. can't. can't. ""bUt sWeDeN dIdNt loCkDoWn""

I share every day every single covid denier that's said me. Honestly, people really look data, right there. 

Not YouTube. Pfizer need 2 weeks prepare presentation vaccine, selling every across world ? 60-70% misleading assumes everyone mingles everyone i.e. homogeneous population. reality, population heterogeneous, e.g. basement dwellers never get contact anyone mother, high risk people come contact everyone probably vaccinated first. 40% realistic achieve herd immunity show soon, maybe already month cases may drop almost 0. Hi!

Me flatmates tested positive, 3 us, 2 lost taste/smell. asymptomatic now, tested positive yesterday.

Now know positive, live ""normally"" inside home? wearing masks outside room etc? I'm doctor want take risk taking viral charge.

Thanks! want us sad mourn time? mean sucks world keeps spinning can’t sit around thinking tragedy day we’re already prevent spreading.  hey anyone know thread anywhere folks sharing experiences side effects vaccine? gotten first moderna dose. ok serious answer though. Assuming somewhat qualified. Check state protocols. Ask employer. steps pretty straight forward, there's also unintended side affects prepare for. course, make sure CPR current case someone goes anaphylactic shock. also got understand risks mess up, even though volunteers, could still lose license. Happy new year, fun party? Could possibly got trip grocery store? could going quarantine? LA County, they’re changing Dodger Stadium larger places vaccination sites. 12k people day start vaccinated. Diabetics everyday hear ya. guess point is, aren’t asking volunteers train administer vaccine? i’m doctor nurse anything, hard could be? could learn 15 minutes less.   jabbiest!! Ever since lost Harambe world right, this? countries expect get whichever vaccine given. Except ""Hong Kong"" Cantonese pronounced like ""hoeng gong,"" close enough, call Hong Kong, unlike Mandarin pronunciation listed. basic training , shot book get shots required basic training over, would line us outside gym large building, would go single file, two people direct across guns looked like staplers, would walk them, would put gun arm fire it, 2 shots given 10 sec next guy right behind you, took like 10 min 200 people Arresting people (and putting unnecessarily jail already already bad) isn’t going anything make situation worse. Maybe government something actually helps, like pay people stay home actually lockdown. can’t train volunteers? give vaccine train give shot i’ll volunteer time. Oregon 10th world among highest saying ""pretty good""? I'd love too. unfortunately part training mentioned charge confirming whether people next line. (I think face angry people get dismissed) It’s probably different ailment honest live Pacific Northwest raining almost daily since October. 

Not sure mean live normally hope mean going bars restaurants pretending staying home? forget 9-11 level deaths every single day? pandemic still raging still another peak!  Simp walking laws established situations like these. state reopen fun things I'll take vacation I've saved go somewhere open.

Which need shit done national level. Morons living sane states travel neighboring moron state isn’t national effort, horrible transmission vector. people failed mask distance bad lockdowns required, shit gets shut down. people changed behavior could avoid summer shutdowns, people going reckless stupid, even reckless stupid needed lockdowns put place. It’s vicious cycle feeds exponentially. 

Don’t stupid don’t lockdowns. Unfortunately, many stupid people make lockdowns inevitable, people ignore lockdowns make worse. chance avoid lockdowns, reap sow.

JUNE.

Ffs okay. Wow that’s bad hope comes back her! I’m fine morning. Look 2009 H1N1 vaccinations triggered narcolepsia children even though safe adults. covid mostly harmless children, would irresponsible give untested vaccine. live Nevada haven’t even taken stew pot cupboard yet. We’ve administered 58,000 205,000 doses distributed compared Texas 832,000 administered 1,942,000 doses distributed. Roughly, rounded. state’s problem? state government dropping ball here? I’m sincerely asking anyone accurate answer. Thanks Restrictions nervousness rather facts would absolutely idiotic Test &amp; Trace failure: government's responsibility.

Vaccine success: nothing government.

Both rely public private sectors. Seasonality regional outbreak events explain spread much new variant surely easily spread. 

I hate one talks this. Even virologists epidemiologists conservative estimates new variant’s transmissibility mum this. 

If anything whole pandemic taught scientists know lot, human race can’t confidently say much anything viruses spread. It’s wild little info even spread flu. Moderna vaccine developed back January. trials since then. Operation Warp Speed funded COVID spending bills supposed cover company's costs scaling production producing vaccines final approval. lol seattle tingz republicans infecting democrats eventually concluded likely place catch flu public transport. Perhaps rail/tube/buses/planes continue require masks longer places. Death rate due influenza slightly U-shaped. peaks heavily old age, non-negligible peak young ages.

e.g. rates COVID-19 compatible 0% children. fact, death rates young adults similar due everyday activities.

## Abstract

Understanding immune memory SARS-CoV-2 critical improving diagnostics vaccines, assessing likely future course COVID-19 pandemic. analyzed multiple compartments circulating immune memory SARS-CoV-2 254 samples 188 COVID-19 cases, including 43 samples ≥ 6 months post-infection. IgG Spike protein relatively stable 6+ months. Spike-specific memory B cells abundant 6 months 1 month post symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ cells CD8+ cells declined half-life 3-5 months. studying antibody, memory B cell, CD4+ cell, CD8+ cell memory SARS-CoV-2 integrated manner, observed component SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics. went like month ago mistake. 8 days! hear that’s pretty mild round side effects. 

Not anyone died vaccine (and likely won’t future either) someone chip tooth shivering much. many people felt completely awful day without Tylenol helping. might otherwise kids. glad looking something glad about. Sheesh, going discover rare individuals virus “super mutators”?? Closest thing California one ""stay home"" order mid-March 2020 late-June 2020, even then, traffic greatly reduced unprecedented levels, call ""lockdown"". People still moving throwing parties, treating like mini-vacation. Police enforce public health orders (if all).

Toward tail end, could tell people done it.

I really worry time next big pandemic hits, US still sh-t together terms public health/pandemic preparedness. I'm trying learn. comments like explain anything.

Could please help educate me? seems USA receiving way doses EU. Seems unfair. saw quite people asking random John &amp; Jane Smith volunteer. Well, mess up, liable. wonder nurse asks 3 different times birthday, hospitals sued many times malpractice. Another reason side effects. ER's ICU's already full. imagine 1000 people got vaccine sudden can't breath bad batch shots. Obviously worst case scenario, least EMT, know ventilate someone. meantime, I've taken 2/3 classes way vaccinate people. classes filled various first responders medical experience. may feel anxious, worried, scared, know help way. Israel significantly better medium term position Europe, month older folks immunity 20-30%+ population vaccine new data whether goggles face shield + mask worth outside healthcare setting (compared mask alone)? OP said friend better, feeling 100% good. Deaths lag behind around 2 3 weeks. Ireland extremely low numbers 2 weeks ago, deaths sadly catch around next week. Well that's fine never sick. really much ask people wear mask sick go (to get food medicine doctors)? I'm saying time welcome normalization wearing masks feel well.

Edit: also truly believe would save lives. ""Those rookie numbers. Gotta pump numbers up"". Love quote Assumes, probably, maybe well, it’s good thing you’re charge. president nothing 375,000 people dead. we’re averaging nearly 4,000 deaths 200,000 new cases day. i’m sorry you’re inconvenienced, heartless fuck. Palestinians literally refused Israeli help California actually 3rd highest per capita infection rate world. Per capita.
Hopefully know per capita means want talk effect absolute population numbers. Imagine 300m people potentially vaccinated June. could well happen JNJ shows even something approaching decent results compared shit show non-US AZ trial showed. Ireland worse get vote for. Imagine virus mutates average every x number generations. virus inside 5 months, allowing multiple generations 18 mutations life infection. like tree branches spreading out, looking little different trunk. like people pandemic, definitely like people pandemic, gladly avoid near people fact. CDC's IFR reason excluded persons 80 years age older, highest IFR's years: 0.00002

20-49 years: 0.00007

50-69 years: 0.0025

70+ years: 0.028

I originally thought 70+ meant people ages 70-102, footnote said ""The estimates persons ≥70 years old presented **do include persons ≥80 years""** opinion data presented misleading way. 70-80 year olds IFR 2.8% plausible, write 70+ years. Good. never want see Sir David Attenborough Covid sentence again. 🤣 impossible to. /r/BdsmDIY Chances last pandemic next years, frequency could increase.  literally told would be.  surprise slightest. video goes antibiotic resistance, apply thing geographic regions, quarantining groups people, natural immunity, vaccines, remember back 2020 Q2, 8 major strains COVID-19 spread geographically around world. North America one, South America another. Europe &amp; North Africa one, rest Africa another. natural reproduction action. would apply local geographies well.

For vast majority time, focus major strains first eradicate contagious (usually higher contagion leads deaths higher lethality), lethal, remaining variants.

This allows us devote resources effectively curbing opportunities infectious spread lethality, paving way containment eventually/hopefully eradication. don’t give anything. I’ve never felt compassion towards animals provide meat eat nearly every meal. surprised little compassion felt meatpackers pandemic started, I’m equally untroubled. No. Read article. Mine scheduled Friday. Can't wait. work pharmacy still get doctors trying prescribe patients. Really shakes trust smart doctors supposed be. thing is, you’re right isn’t *just flu* also isn’t Black Plague either. spring, even sometimes still today, see many people truly quite overreaction virus lengths need go mitigate spread. It’s difficult find place internet doesn’t downplay severity virus also doesn’t overreact either. not? Yeah many, think like three per person? joke could be, aware documented side-effect. 

However, could also related eating pile semi-hardboiled eggs lunch best-avoided salad bar. P.A. skeptical vaccine involved infrequent complaint.

The truth never known. treasure protect costs!   I’m guessing US open partial capacity masks May/June depending location. Don’t hold breath large national tours A-list bands, won’t happen 2022. know one large outdoor venue near planning summer season right now. bands talks popular local bands mid-sized bands would usually see 1,000 capacity venue. venue usually hosts premier artists.  There's nowhere country that's operating completely normal. Even places lax restrictions still shut would huge super spreader events like indoor concerts, individuals taking voluntary precautions might see about. 

The flu also circulates globe. flu virus causes seasonal epidemic given region virus last year that'd lying dormant involves reintroduction parts world. spread interrupted somewhere else could mean milder flu season even precautions taken. ever considered highest priority nation?  doubt it. run terribly name us staying open. Everybody use incorrectly, ignorance lazyness, also saving money. ""on you"" endanger everyone else Srsly. It’s time give one up. 220 million people already it, would seeing dramatic decline cases. case.

By-the-way, ""10x"" CDC's ""lowball"" number. actual estimate 91 million total infections would put 4x, possible ranges that. Uggg makes total sense honestly. Every new development academia rushes w fufu studies since everyone wants piece publishing pie. say though incredibly promising associations microbiome brain, but; wasn’t aware hypebeast-space, academically speaking. Appreciate piece mind Phish vaccine? I’m in! always number one reason worldwide china like lockdown started. sure it’s discussed here, Citi Field New York going used vaccine hub end month. that’s cool see places like used help get shots out. Let try.  body unable fight virus.  Whatever strain best compete mutations.  ever mutations happen improve survivability thrive continue mutate infection eliminated. thank you. know someone would say ""politicians"" precise word intentionally using. That's necessarily true based specific incident. received vaccine shot 2 days prior exposure Capitol Riots. well documented take 10 days vaccine start Jayapal told Cut last week that, like many House colleagues, received first vaccination shot Monday, January 4. Two days later, workplace It’s already desecrated. They’ll also need remove pee smell presidential bed. least many cases children getting seriously ill. happens, super rare. get vast majority adults get vaccine we'll good shape one approved children. Yeah same, especially since said last night “at least 2020 didn’t take David Attenborough”  Northwell Health, major New York City-area health system, confirmed advising staff use single N95 mask full shift store paper bag using it. health system said following CDC number cases expected increase, doctors two New York hospitals using paper bag system ration masks. Supervisors provide paper bag surgical mask doctor, put name it. supervisors keep list doctors received mask, library. Doctors get another mask mask gets dirty damaged.

They re-used sterilization. also re-used letting sit long enough virus survived. said comment better nothing it? nothing better nothing? Another data point, Gottlieb says thinks 30% country could exposed 10% could vaccinated end 100M infections (not cases) 33M vaccinations. Based seen read think sounds spot on.

40% total immunity starts get towards herd immunity slowing spread, higher areas lower others. Areas like North Dakota high end.

This also suggests number infections somewhere around 3-4 times number cases. also suggests infection fatality rate 25-33% case fatality rate. CFR 1.6% suggests 0.4-0.5% IFR. Current guidance defer vaccination isolation period ended. confirmed positive case, it’s recommended wait 90 days you’ve covid vaccinated. Yeah, fair. hopefully people responsible point continue responsible safe go back normal. definitely right lockdown fatigue hitting strong. combined vaccine going around actually effective hard *not* look light end tunnel. 

To fair though sub pessimistic last spring good reason. people claiming ""just flu"" would magically disappear April. people sub arguing back virus big deal things gonna suck correct. 

Either way, glad home stretch viruses, exposing immune system twice (not close together, hence 21 day delay) gives much longer-lasting immunity. vaccine, know get full immunity days ~5 21 already, test happens (when immunity might start waning) get booster shot. Since run one way trials, that's way FDA could reasonably approve it.

Not testing single-shot 12-week-separated shots substantial oversight trials, though. part rushed. someone priority task, self employed like child care provider could difficult. someone may essential services company isn’t classified coordinating agency such, would get passed over. example run program providing housing homeless, don’t congregate setting aren’t priority agency. Since gives conservative estimates specifically says “by fall” much inclined think far sooner That’s really good good team! scary thing. think vaccine, planning get it? planning get vaccine made second guess husband hearing this. wary new meds takes since reaction! flu shot September fine though. talk hematologist risks. Quebecers hate snowbirds... hated came back virus April. public health officials involved lifetime government employees. leadership change top good, people really need dial back expectations. Yeah, 9 months ago everyone agreed end game vaccine. vaccine people believing it’s still dangerous interact socially even immunized. absolute crazy talk.

Someone recommended fits super well secure. 91MM US? That’s nuts think about. access string, yarn, thread dental floss? Tie ear loops together behind ears solution. They're open Ohio months. Crazy really. Quebec mostly left-wing putting restrictive COVID measures since beginning pandemic.

We small population morons (like every province) like binge watch conspiracies follow every Trump advice.

Where senator donated Trump campaign? province started downsizing healthcare system pandemic? Even isn’t going accurate, know even one dose significantly reduces risk death severe sickness, ultimately important, it’s worth gamble take  Again, big concerts probably wont happening summer 2022. much uncertainty. Shhh... don’t know terrible year be. Look it’s started. Colorado's plan today. stuff dotted line 1B? added weeks back. used high up, Phase ""2"" along side pre-existing conditions. now, teachers school administrators, grocery workers age, anyone working transit manufacturing food agriculture, bus drivers, truck drivers, journalists, government workers... told ""jump line"" get vaccine ahead 60-69 year olds people age pre-existing conditions.

It mean can't catch disease, means likely die anymore since immune system look it. still spread thing vaccinated friend spread people close contact vaccinated. 

Just like flu... wager great vaccine news, new President, democratic senate+house, divisional Bills Browns Patriots, Steelers, Seahawks, 2021 looking up.

The attempted coup exception, look terribly it’s gone Republican Party, there’s least upside. last week anything go by. know decade becomes defined years go on. 2020’s may looked back change revolt; knows it’ll good bad gets through. 

I hope last week doesn’t set precedent that’s way handle decisions. so, next 9 years something else. mom 60’s coming retirement administer vaccines. given vaccine protect her... lives dad 70 received vaccine yet. open dads age group tomorrow, seems like many people vying vaccines wait get vaccinated, laws able get appointment March state. worried!!! anyone know priority older spouses medical workers? Huh... would think efficient that.  And, I'm sorry help myself... pretty accurate. Bro, fight. man whole childhood. Lol guy’s idiot didn’t realize people still used phrase Yeah. That’s ended “no win situation” wasn’t clear since didn’t cover sides. issues always present due every 4 years anyway. discrepancies training available athletes always going issue well. Barely country compete Russian state funded programs. countries athletes barely even accept sponsorships help pay training.

But immediate future, athletes working training programs need know timing optimize peak performance. trained four years life making huge sacrifices get yeah. Probably want now. lol. one one chance Olympics working life I’m sure you’d devastated. Plus money wasted! isn’t true, developing vaccine variants would take six weeks according Pfizer, it’s doubtful would need full trial jurisdictions Unfortunately, trials tested symptomatic people, instead everyone, know asymptomatic people vaccine. LOL comment Dacia Sandero reminded Top Gear. triggered scene Attenborough slogging jungle search exotic species stumbles upon Clarkson Hammond May. course heavy antibiotics recently.

Since ive come I've supplementing tablespoon ACV probiotic every day. also handful kimchi sauerkraut breakfast every day.

I might odd kombucha well. 

Am risking overdoing sound like okay plan? What’s evidence changing schedule? isn’t much Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, trials compare different dose spacing compare one two doses... data demonstrate protection first dose sustained 21 days.

These would seem rather important caveats.  Thanks clarification makes nervous lol, they’re aware it’s symptom ya know THING. Well right data whether vaccines prevent transmission since trials set basically want us, even vaccinated, stay home? know you’re eligible vaccine too? Aren’t immune compromised people able take vaccines unless live virus them? mRNA ones don’t that. Well rich connected getting vaccine. rest us That’s misunderstanding. means trial, 95% symptomatic infections happened placebo arm rather arm people actually vaccinated. It’s likely symptomatic infections occur vaccine symptoms least somewhat reduced- it’s nebulous measure, vaccines 100% effective preventing severe disease. We’re number 1!!! MURICA!!! We're already past 20% vaccinated, month hope we'll hitting 40%, though things slowed we're giving second doses 150k people day legit thought already dead, like couple years past. great news me, he's still alive! Lol I’m addressing fact declaratively said catch spread vaccinated. CDC prob make statement 2 months  way got 95% effective 20 people placebo arm trial got covid (with symptoms) every one person vaccine arm trial.  There's way know whether 95% less likely 100% people, 100% less likely 95% people mix things. Although believe people get vaccine less likely get infected become contagious that's something that's verified either.

So, may possible testing like future, something that's possible today. God Would great true! mom 60’s coming retirement administer vaccines. given vaccine protect her... lives dad 70 received vaccine yet. open dads age group tomorrow, seems like many people vying vaccines wait get vaccinated, laws able get appointment March state. worried!!! anyone know priority older spouses medical workers? make sound like 20% population wants masks well 2022 sway enforcing laws ignore 80%. 

Governments revoke mask mandates voters say it’s required else suffer consequences. think models begin with? country (except UK) try model herd immunity scenarios\*?

\*even infection rate 'that serious' might add. hasnt cdc announced exactly? He's famous narration wildlife documentaries. Teenage Mutant Ninja COVID factory Im guessing dont know much pacific theater. It’s fine till hit bursa know going push mutations maybe make vaccine useless? Supply Germany quite good recently. mask 1-2 euros, available pretty much everywhere.

How daft says nothing telling hospitals hold second doses. IMO key stop trying vaccinate entirety categories. Vaccinate 50-60% category, point slows gotten ""eager beavers""... open next category.

So like healthcare workers 1A... done 50-60% (which going fast) moved 75+ (or 65+ whatever), still allowing 40% remaining healthcare worker stragglers/reluctant get jabs change mind trickle whatever.

The slowdown partially happening get eager beavers, states obsessing getting slowpokes rather moving thing next category. even close, telling hospitals hope get enough stock, bidens plan government stop holding 2nd dose send right away. way two groups trying hold second dose. Correct. overly-complicated tier systems proving disaster states. put age floor place administer first-come, first-serve basis. That's ultimately minimize loss life. matter, im vaccinated life goes back normal  actually think good idea hold amount back, maybe 50% idk percent be, damn, look like idiots companies fuck production, fire, covid outbreak knocks staff, plane can't take time, there's road construction, UPS goes strike, dozes low percentage events happen cause people areas country get second dose properly What's everyone's recommendations beat site follow daily (or somewhat daily) numbers? job involves semi senior level administrator government agency that's extremely beauracratic lots legal pitfalls.

There's way I'd want home. thankfully aside weeks April, to. course... smh...

So federal property.. mean masks aren’t required places like federal prisons, federal courts, etc? Source? Well theorized one reasons Covid deadlier flu fact chance cytokine storm ARDS higher covid coronavirii like common cold. Fair point flu traveling Southern Hemisphere! didn’t even think that. 

I personally think areas country lax enough shouldn’t see cases like many places are, first point could aren’t seeing flu regardless. Title gore still stupid. Okay, flu that's killed nearly 400k Americans. guess get control avoid large gatherings, stay away people can, wear masks can't, generally avoid breathing air someone else exhaled into. snake eyes. 1 33,333 infections. might well try get kid win decent sized lottery keep school next fall Ah gotcha Execution strategy everything. easier optimistic competent administration. Also, JNJ vaccine early readout days away clear lot questions regarding vaccine rollout. Private parties fine (alcohol cheaper/better too). Fully public bar parties may need stay outdoors til know transmission post vaccine thing. countries bought earlier currently used vaccines. EU Germany backed wrong horse. That’s shit. reason “why” ;)   believe say don’t know. Hypothetically, much risk use public transit right now?

I live NJ, case numbers aren’t super bad moment. I’m 20s, immunocompromised, pre-existing condition. family almost nothing close contact home, eating table days mom isn’t working.

With vectored vaccine (like J&amp;J AZ), need design completely new virus vector requires testing time, don’t either.

99.99% mutations harmless. perfectly possible heard immunity without medications. we've done history. dangerous game play though since lost control situation. Politburo reduced ashes. 91 million would still fantastic news herd immunity (not fantastic reasons stay me).

That's 27% kind immunity. potentially 30% current vaccinations. makes lives easier get people vaccinated. news 800 cedars sinai workers diarehia covid ""The year thought could afford lock downs""  Please tell yeeted plane. since understand people authority disingenuous.

Great ""[Good point/A point] would speak favour keeping schools open achieve herd immunity faster. (...)

So evidence herd immunity strategy...

Remind me. Sweden close schools?

ETA: Using quote keeping schools open would promote herd immunity evidence Sweden actually closed secondary tertiary schools. thought typing something similar. Great see fellow top gear fan! Gotcha! federal property ultimately trump administration sets rule. chamber though sets rule session, apparently that's enforced much. Exactly point. think reserving dose hope we'll it.
Whatever, important thing approve AZ J&amp;J without reach herd immunity soon :/ Yeah long time anywhere discuss negative impact lockdowns also person OK mitigations behavior changes slow spread. Could link comment? title illegal. happy volunteer. tried volunteer locally nurse vaccine wouldn’t let due age risk... truth told relieve made get vaccine first!

I advocating cutting line, experiencing much higher risk due age... understand still pass along coronavirus even vaccinated, right? Nobody seems really understand this. soon start vaccinating people create evolutionary pressure virus defeat vaccine. Now, coronavirus mutate nearly quickly flu, give enough time eventually find way defeat vaccine. clock started, hopefully eliminate time. also looked after... Hemmingflock never written either. except 1926 Mrs. Marion Hemming Flock HAHA I’m kinda proud initial argument better nothing supply non-existent. Ideally, messaging supposed change encourage people use better masks supply issues resolved. Yet, are.

I recommend KF94 mask. strikes balance comfort protection without compromising either. language choice bit alarmist. Testing required given way kids deal real disease, ‘hit hard’ ‘hazardous’ ‘blast radius’ seem unfortunate language choices delicate subject. look lengths went, look little mitigate spread - hospitals health services still managed get significantly impacted several metro areas (New York/ Northeast spring, Houston/Miami summer, Dakotas/Midwest fall, Los Angeles/Winter). 

The two ways looking either - there’s nothing could done prevent spread naught, 2 prevented even bigger crisis everything did. Really? He's done anything People seem ignore fact 2021 started worst part 2020. Please provide one valid reason countries (sometimes smaller less resourced) eclipsing Germany’s vaccination rate That's silly. big pharma ever want responsible adverse effects? Yes? everyone else.

We've however I'm discussion again, since understand people authority disingenuous. You’re forgetting one caveat big CDC states don’t report weekend, Monday’s tally includes catch-up prior days. Nothing says vaccine stops carrier. Medical nursing students, plus clinical faculty given vaccine work. limited amount though (of doses). heard anything PT, OT, Pharm students, however. barely started group letting 65+ join in.

*""The federal government didn’t give us additional allocation,"" Cuomo said. ""How effectively serve 7 million people, eligible, without priority? I’m 90 years old I’m class person 65-plus.""* Honestly goalpost looks like “once risk people vaccinated” instead full herd immunity point Unless vaccines prevent symptoms affect transmission, unlikely, adults vaccinated unlikely children would get sick.

It's also arguable routine risk factors accept approach Covid19 risk children, assuming otherwise good health. Neat, right now, [yours comment words hemmingflock sparrows it, apparently! would prove infected one even chance would mean testing find infected genomic sequencing match strains. 

**gasp!** privilege comes called sir!!!

You’re seriously looking things mad Probable took fewer precautions fully protected, saw BBC interview sprightly 90+ year old gent got vaccinated early December, gave impression understand wait till 2nd dose, sounded like planning seeing grand kids days later.

Like said, people congregate living (nursing homes, prisons) make tiny percent population enormous percent deaths (35-50%). It’s no-brainer vaccinate first. Stop traveling live hospitals woods, there’s reason keep stuff closed forever.

Certainly difference ""herd immunity approach"" non-herd-immunity considering population density on

Population density? compared Stockholm's population density cities Europe? According Wikipedia something like 34th densest city Europe, that's spread happened. Meanwhile, Oslo much less dense. Population density overall? Well yeah, course low country uninhabitated forest. Sweden one highest levels urbanization Europe. me, still seems like could've done much better, makes sense compare us *more* neighbouring countries, let's exclude European countries pretend like we're sooo special here.  

Stockholm: 4800 people per square kilometer 
Oslo: 1400 people per square kilometer  

Stockholm 3.5 times dense Oslo. *Everyone likes that*  Americans, always hilarious. Great nitpicking,

And wait what? vaccines here. rolled shockingly slow pace total chaos ones available. Oxford applied approval vaccine EU. decision made Jan 29 apparently meeting, before? one knows

Vaccination top priority, priority. Literally nothing else matter Research late 80's early 90's sounds right focused gene therapy vaccines. mRNA research gene therapy vaccines close behind, mid-90s believe (I notes handy).

Either I'm lucky random cold everyone else covid antibodies still working 10 months on. Lucky plumber here. Exposing biohazard part job with.no hazzard pay.... even ileagle charge extra know hazard home like positive aids hepituse case  know im hyperbolic second statement. one locked down, cases/deaths exploding anyway, bottom quarter states vaccination rates? good. guys think 3 trial data US-based Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, example, gives 95 per cent efficacy rate. However, 44,000 volunteers 3,410 participants displayed Covid-19 symptoms tested, according US Food Drug Administration report. unlikely event participants tested positive, total efficacy rate would drop 30 per cent.  vaccine manufacturers include light headaches even testing positive Covid-19,” said Palácios. “The important number 50.”  added inclusion light cases represented “stringent test”, complicating comparisons Covid-19 vaccines.

Sweden significantly Covid deaths excess deaths causes. Never heard Time production? I'm sorry people get vaccinated stop social distancing. I'll wear mask can't live isolation months more. risk people vaccinated would keep social distancing? So, clear, 50.38% effective Covid19 disease, 50.38% effective infection SARS-CoV-2, correct?

There difference there, infection necessarily mean disease. amount exotic places hes been, im pretty sure hes immune everything.

You get picture. No, absolutely believe patients tell got COVID one time left house open mailbox. ""I know caught it"" could mean know caught it, many people going hospital saying, ""I've friends every weekend whole time finally caught me."" Especially now. People ashamed admit they've ""cheating,"" especially healthcare providers, see making massive sacrifice. clinical colleagues cheating regularly, non-clinical family even worse, swear got place absolves personal responsibility, like work subway.

You really work hard data, hard data says everyone nearly equal risk catching/spreading it, within 2-4 fold anyway. Meanwhile, 1000-fold difference severity children people 80+. choose 5% 10% 20% population vaccinate quickly, choose elderly. basically eliminate threat hospital overload.

Also, vaccinating likely spread also means likely vaccinating who've already gotten it.

Lots reasons go elderly vulnerable first. Headline suitable scientists said. said vaccine could used minimize covid effects pfizer /modern ones would reach herd immunity todays evening time post thing again? every single day weeks.

Fingers crossed Lonza production ramp-up Moderna vaccine. infuriating part really takes actually get rid covid 5 week supported lockdown basic testing tracing little bit strategy afterwards. proven many times now, governments consider bc stonks Like firemen trying get wave 1. kind bullshit that? American hero worship culture like ""whelp, gotta we'll get cancelled supporting firemen."" USA vaccinate 300k people? Thats cdc site says, also says 2001 might error demonstrated Chimps rodents, multiple vaccine types confer sterilizing immunity SARS-CoV-2.

We can't run challenge trials humans though, much harder study undertake.

Given tiny fraction percentage reinfections worldwide, studies showing immune responses lasting 12 years (original SARS), seems really likely sterilizing immunity happening. call Boomer, means Boomer, would know like 50 years ago?! I'm saying great back then, contrary sucked (I would never want go back), people friendlier. Yeah, friendlier... pasted two-lane road, waved, give finger; Christmas Season, walked past said, ""Merry Christmas""; vaccines came out, people lined up, especially remember Polio Vaccine new.

 flu+covid vaccine

has ever vaccine like virus like this? would body theoretically able handle point sufficient immunity both? spot on. Go grocery department store right now, find majority shoppers 60+ risk DONT GIVE FUCK! uk thought tier 4 lockdown similar march one. confused dont apply measures Thanks, thinking going doctor whether covid not. say calling ""tiresome"" really outrage...


Quote article:
“if entire group friends gotten full vaccine regimen least week passed since second shot, probably okay get together closed setting, you’re interacting public.""



I specifically agree okay get together ""closed setting"", mentioned personal responsibility. I'm going change behavior may infect someone taking appropriate precautions. 60% time it’s 100% partisan. know I’m dick lol sorry :) lol dumb comment line soon get even still told keep masks distance. well sources I've seen say prevent spread control deaths. Oh, sure. always going minority people getting early take blanket approach. 

And christ 37% low figure. Gives work cut increase confidence vaccine.  honestly thought died years ago I'm hoping lead less flu well less colds spread around. HOPEFULLY country accept wearing mask go ill, cultures do. 

It wonders general sickness. Ahh yes, let’s hurt restaurants even they’ve been. I’m sure people axe grind won’t take advantage anonymous reviews. know that. can’t stand doom point, safely said man immortal. studies humans yet, we'd run challenge trials serious ethical issues there.

There however, multiple studies rodents Chimps Macaques show sterilizing immunity granted multiple different vaccines.

Sterilizing immunity current vaccines seems likely, technically correct, proven it.

OH, likely 100% people obtain sterilizing immunity, again, likely decent percentage will. I’m gonna need 2021 slow it’s roll. projections spring (April). distribution takes time, vaccination going make huge difference wave tapers warmer summer months. 

Vaccinations still matter - lot - longer term. (But point debate Phase 1 prioritization longer relevant - we're debating matter weeks difference vaccination times, here, makes sense difference deaths minimal. April, everyone 65+ _and_ essential workers offered vaccination.) Deaths way higher too... WHO's counting? logic flawed bc covid shares similarities sars mutates far less lasting immunity, it’s fear mongering lmao cant die, whos gonna narrate death gasp humanity aliens? work me. Ok friends dad complete idiot. Back April, said wasn’t going get dosed another year. doesn’t want “guinea pig”. Guess got vaccinated yesterday. 

Peer pressure FOMO real things. Like masks were. one wearing one April. July you’re weird person don’t one on. Yea, except without /s....

I've people sub pretend know talking argue masks social distancing help flu. Like... serious. would tell otherwise (even evidence southern hemisphere's flu season essentially zero), still told wrong. I’m seeing lots people across threads conflate various plans hold back second doses. much aggressive (with corresponding risks benefits) others.

Suppose country 100 million people get shipments 10M vaccines per week.

Old US plan, today: vaccinate 5M new people per week. shipment goes half first doses, half freezers. production increases, increase similarly split.

New US plan: vaccinate 10M new people first three weeks. that, priority goes second doses due followed many first doses can, production stays exactly flat switch every three weeks giving first second doses, production increases allocating supply new first doses.

UK Quebec plan: give 10M first doses per week ten weeks start second doses couple months late. production speeds up, speed timeline.

The new US plan incremental change gives short-term speed boost compared last plan, small number people get second dose late (basically supply disruptions), week two late. big risk given know immune response.

By contrast, Quebec+UK plan radical, give far people immunity far faster, lot speculative science side. There’s decent argument made it, esp modified version give at-risk people two doses low risk people one dose first, it’s much gamble way US plan really isn’t. biology major.. approve reason quit job get Disability Medicare whatever used that, right?

If UBI people disabilities could still work much wanted/were able to, needed universal healthcare. mask introversion? think might confusing introverts socially anxious. way lockdown would last March. Even Germany vaccinated vulnerable people end Winter. Fauci proven incompetence time time again, yet still take word gospel. There's also social stigma. communities, people lived deceased even family members might ostracized looked upon members community.  don’t say :0 Brazilian researchers testing China’s Sinovac Vaccine said Tuesday full data showed 50.38% effective Covid-19 late-stage trials, almost 30 percentage points lower previously announced, concerns grow study’s transparency.

 Ouch... that's pretty poor. understand point , there's several hospital network work home lol, like HR IT. Additionally , 37% first group opted get vaccine.  poster clearly comes privileged, *I never leave house,* lifestyle. us completely fend need expose workplaces every day.

I really see problem occasionally hanging someone else avoiding high risk individuals spread it.

I'm going hang friends go see Grandmother right after. entire sub evidence actually. think he’s saying vaccines people property Florida spend winters aren’t necessarily state residents vaccines people want fly Florida get vaccine actual Florida connection. 🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆 fucking WOW   see happen. alone know around 15 people tested postive ""majority"" people US 38 would better look 38-90 something age group want make comparisons.

that said, risk dying covid 55x dying getting hit car, risk getting covid order 100x likely getting hit car (if believe CDC estimate number actual cases)

even 2 million cancer diagnoses small fraction covid diagnoses. 

it's easy make things sound good select demographic, demographic big make be. easily consult actuarial life table quick google want actually understand numbers work  One death news story, one million statistic. Definitely check another probe. could combination faulty probe stuck head. 

If still reading high, would reach doctor. f not? Helmets worn. Yeah want face truth themselves. Sadly great majority people US Didn’t invite people comedown vaccinated? 6. Doubt it. I'm bay area everyone know can't wait drop mask. people cautious (as should) mean forever.  Trump's direct involvement obviously long done. heard Kushner involved awhile. Pence may still be, think he's type sabotage process.  suspect decisions made full agreement incoming administration, directed them. never see anyone ever rhetoric fueling people small indoor gatherings definitely safe. Keep telling people little longer, little longer, little longer eventually stop listening.

The goal reduce smog levels (as seen year) reduce pollution related health issues , use engineering reduce flooding places economically viable, switch renewables completely collapse.

The arctic many coastal communities lost, sadly. quarantining entire population largely healthy people months years? quarantining people actually sick actually posed clear present danger around them? bet 67% effective.

I feel lawsuits coming. Centers Disease Control Prevention announced first U.S. death COVID-19 Feb. 29, 2020. Within month, 1,000 Americans dying single day. Since then, we’ve reached daily number many times over. days, 2,500 people died. yet, many largely disconnected pain, unwilling unable recognize process loss.

Are saturated?

Or rational?

What think?   know 2 dose trial readout would be? Let alone cost health care system next 5 10 years. Good luck paying without economy. literally going cost lives future. Lots them. took damn CVS near always 2+ hour wait. Finally went grocery store nearby took 20 min. Cali keeps managing vax 35k weekends ain’t gonna get normalcy I’ll say  *Is* cooking. Ofc state residents dying FL reported deaths legal home states, numbers low.

Ftr, think anyone going forget parents grandparents died, gotta think tourism real estate eventually suffer.

But maybe not. FL known rationality. Thanks. Hate make mistake. Fixed.

Wait, double mistake. Double thanks. late sense would missed protection October, November, December. getting provide protection end flu season! basically people voluntarily feel necessary protect health regardless government tells do.

Learn something. mean going away. means control enough enough people immune natural methods vaccination, threat certain threshold.

But since can't seem fathom Google, let quote reputable Herd immunity occurs large portion community (the herd) becomes immune disease, making spread disease person person unlikely. result, whole community becomes protected — Often, percentage population must capable getting disease order spread. called threshold proportion. proportion population immune disease greater threshold, spread disease decline. known herd immunity threshold. Well I’m even disappointed. do, cause people getting them. California 60% healthcare’s workers aren’t getting shots slowed almost stop vaccinations. Unless get hold that, mass deaths everyday norm. Wuhan enters chat.  think idea leave zoo (Think opposite hangover movie). Also probably ever able pat it. could argue better open doors rave inside meetup. Either way, within limits stop people going completely insane fk lockdownies complaining it. asked 10 months gotten us anywhere. point life must go (for 99,7% us) Coward. theory 95% immune (* simplification) now, per figure 2 incidence GBS narcolepsy slightly higher vaccinated one particular H1N1 vaccine, *much* higher become infected H1N1. probably seriously harmed fewer 40 kids per million infections.

Categorically untrue. H1N1 luckily deadly flu strain, contagious widespread. Statistically, vaccinating allowing people catch infection would led harm, since getting swine flu much likely trigger conditions Pandemrix. 

As example, trying compare modern medicine 1976 medicine stupid. I'm sorry. word it. 

I also much say graph citations. Gardasil vaccines recommended girls aged 13 26, people already exposed HPV age 26. assume received vaccine (especially closer 26) already exposed HPV. addition, even though highly used since 2007, still puts majority recipients 20s. average age diagnosis cervical cancer around 50. far soon see dramatic effect majority vaccinated people yet even reached age would risk developing cancer. Point there's lot skeptical about.

Yes, cherry pick data, pretend reasonable scared something less dangerous taking Tylenol. COVID-19 mutates couple orders magnitude slower flu. Getting effective vaccine considerably easier. I’m Ireland haven’t home since Nov 2019 due covid. cannot get selfish fellow Irish peeps also live abroad were, Christmas.

Mine told adopt tiger. Thank god I’ve vaccinated You’re confusing distributed administered. Check CDC website linked. says 2979 per 100k NY 2949 per 100k Florida.

Nice try though. Thinking need reach herd immunity going back ""normal"" insane? Literally talking months difference save tens thousands hundreds thousands lives. guess I'm insane. According Cuomo even ain’t necessary. Thanks. Lol that’s problem never find good article Many people think earth flat don’t think there’s point entertaining ideas. Gotta grow Thank God! Would better coming Wernstorm. 

Uh absolutely not. feel effects virus weeks months without autoimmune disorder. point need parse also parse likely complain non-specific symptoms. Sooooo many long hauler data based online surveys. True. Although shopping going exactly scream ""promiscuity"" (I looking vibrators, one person looking butt plugs, creepy dude turned lurking dildo aisle), esteem health safety holds true avoiding infections sex toys. Suga, Mori Nikai reason Japan struggling stop covid right now, Mori desperately wants hold Olympics, Nikai behind GoTo Campaign encourages people travel domestically (he’s chairman Nippon Travel Agents Association), Suga puppet two. 

In words, don’t want anti covid measures stop want too. greed costing lives. elected officials worked hard distribution plan. Think phase 1b tier 2 group!!!! /s China locked time. use strict, targeted lockdowns massive testing first sign trouble. quicker lockdown quicker open back up. half-assed European approach results far longer lockdowns. believe data says don’t know doesn’t. covid” (which isn’t thing they’ve cleared disease virus) likely experienced women. symptoms also nonspecific line “illnesses” like fibromyalgia women also suffer disproportionately. 

What's point?

Is ever slightly conceivable risk factors causing women afflicted fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, etc., whatever are, would also make susceptible long COVID?

And long COVID patients ""cleared disease""; that's literally whole point. Clearing virus immaterial; die COVID weeks clearing virus. widely available online around 2\3 euros 5 10 packs dm, well available Apotheke. Availability issue, cost cheaper (due potential reuse) lot surgical masks. Amazon 40 packs 50 Euros. Yes, annoyance, unreasonable considering protection offer. Also available free senior citizens, teachers, people preexisting conditions.  Makes sense, everyone 45+ wants get vaccinated gets it. I'm sure college students actually care get I'd rather vulnerable groups get first. hahaha, feel like gonna age well  Germany needs drastically accelerate vaccinations, members European Union. Currently they've distributed half many doses per hundred thousand people Alabama, slowest member United States. Sadly, Germany one fastest members European Union. member vaccinating faster American state Denmark, still less doses per hundred thousand people Idaho, one slower members United States.

I understand European Union chose approve vaccines later United Kingdom United States, even going days since approval they're vaccinating *very* slowly. make bit worried Japan Korea, likely begin vaccinations months. Hopefully learn countries vaccinating very, quick rollout. Reduction cases reduces deaths. 25 year old bringing home parents, bring office, bring elderly parents. it’s elderly people dying doesn’t mean none people got infected one person won’t end hospital. gonna say same. always mild spike blood pressure see headline starting 'Sir David Attenborough'. Even worse see Coronavirus mentioned it. Well that's depressing. That's opinion respect that. results full phase 3 study? 78% figure mild symptoms 50% symptoms probably explains difference, people spinning way based different definitions. That's full study everything normalised go off.  SIL complaining reuse masks couple weeks ago works hospital, location may vary. lot companies implementing plans allow people switch full remote. Check company see option. companies even going full time remote near future, even things better. 32 never anything worthwhile. 

Please take instead. Meant say same. Love fella. deserves place Valhalla Derp. right-wing circulating video police told switch gas masks instead normal masks. 

the video starts right takes normal mask, ends right gets gas mask on. 

so brief time switching gas mask, mask, right-wing propagandists trying use say wearing mask overall. legitimate shudder upon first glance photo, thank goodness ok least 8 months minimum. Likely years know talking general people getting vaccine verses money clout verses age health Yeah what’s alternative? Leave West Bank completely? Israel gave Gaza went well. Even Egyptians blocked border since first thing Palestinians freedom Israel left Gaza Strip elect terrorist organisation. Damned do, damned don’t.  Oh thank god. Thanks hate wouldn’t believe amount YouTube channels still talk link civil war, Covid, happened Capitol etc.  Every time report channels, obviously, YouTube nothing. combat return need continue social distance?

The article never suggets that. plainly makes clear covid behind us likely 1-2 year period people get mor sick usual new baseline established government delaying unknown duration means single doses expected second dosage known protection. *Happy wildlife noises* pushed back little, let go know her. works home improvement contractor stopped pick payment. decrease efficacy 85% instead 95%, that's still way better cloth covering may 45%. Whoever running trial giving us warm fuzzies. like parse 78% effective mild Covid statement. say 'general efficacy"" 50.4%. Ugh. 

What mean tend die Covid? Honestly, Sinovac say anything else release results. different hospitals holding second doses VS government holding second doses. Biden wants government stop holding back trump wants hospitals stop holding back. different things.   least somebody’s gonna use it. Suck it, pats  Oh, know. kids get flu shot, there’s decent amount protection there. covid rates area triple metrics virtual learning recommended state dept education many health agencies. there’s less covid circulating, go back school building. 

There’s also issue hybrid learning really virtual learning sitting classroom, especially since ⅔ school decided stay home now. kids comfortable home without masks sanitizer over. never prudent first weeks. held back small percentage second doses case manufacturing hiccup held back every second dose plus additional emergency supply. damn shame. responsible nearly year virus inflicted upon terrorist attack! antimaskers need face criminal charges. article says trump admin telling hospitals stop holding second doses Biden saying government stop holding second doses. two different things. That's false. wrong. Stop spreading misinformation. Yeah I’ll take day get back living normalish life Gas station, care make. Grocery store, used care masks officially enforce 20 percent people there. beer store, saw lady walk back car mask went in, anywhere else people would go right in.

I also expect kind people sex toy shop bit respect little bit bacteria virus people safe cause nobody wants std, compared likely whole areas population going one store regular basis Correlation, necessarily causation vitamin D. many things change cooler temperatures including transmissions people want simple answer. move onto next simple answer first turns false narrative. sick loooooong fucking time dog Evidence. elderly vaccinated beginning summer back normal. mean elderly different parts phase 1 expected last summer.  shitty weeks later general despite everything pointing fine.

Flu contagious long shot. Wearing masks social distancing done great job keeping influenza control Oh he's culling population, concerns him? quite rare though? Reddit pushed frontpage kek guess...

Sweden small country still divided 21 regions. region responsible healthcare uses various systems. Even hospitals use different systems. regions sends data health agency. Since regions slow reporting health agency choose hold data cause incomplete datasets created confusion past.

The quality data comes death count pretty good though. comes court cases Sweden datasets broken less useless little late alright point view. Yup.
Healthcare workers nursing home care workers holding line refusing shots. Science still takes time. wasn’t like first virus ever. real issue stupidity selfishness people wait. I've pretty awful symptoms flu shot. Weakness, chills, fatigue, aches, etc. symptoms actually stopped attending school one day. ban people supermarkets without masks, can't fucking ban sitting members congress? No, means 5% Swedish population **confirmed** infected. mid-June testing COVID-19 limited priority groups - health care staff severe cases - means people sick spring never got official ""confirmed case"" number. Similarly, autumn wave started, lot regions limited testing again, even every region allows people contact confirmed cases symptoms test themselves. lot sick official numbers. Hospital ICU -100%, p=0.5.

Still, 78% non-hospitalized severe disease, hopefully 100% still stay nineties range p=0.001. saw mask covers made waxed cotton canvas. go regular mask repel water rain fog. Try searching online. I'm sure multiple options come up.

I rather see statistics posted interpretations statistics made various news papers.

You got /r/CoronavirusUS want read corona virus situation US. Thank god. Sir David Attenborough god damn ~~national~~ world treasure. Jesus headline scared sec mom retired nurse, 65 years old, immunocompromised, living dad, healthcare worker. get vaccine call old employer tell she'd administer shots got Pfizer Moderna. happy it, think would offered work even required get vaccine, absolutely ridiculous.

Also, lot table vaccination happening. ""in crowd"" (aka work proximity healthcare), get vaccine even completely healthy. We're talking first year medical students, spend 95% time studying inside (as medical student, trust shadowing wait extra 3 months), retired healthcare workers, work home admins, etc... friends work healthcare administration got vaccine healthy 25 year olds.

Reverse age people. Reverse age. equitable efficacious way end crisis.  shortage ffp2 Europe. saw „Sir David Attenborough” „Covid-19” title almost shit saying 90% efective rate then? We're getting better better. can't wait see noticeable week week drop COVID cases deaths. think we'll probably start see decreased deaths mid-late feb due long term care facilities mostly immunized point. actually quite good, allows prevents bad cases almost 100% hospitalizations, similar AstraZeneca. Anytime I’ve ever even tried say masks help sub (while still saying it’s okay mask *mandates*) get downvoted oblivion. hate idea masks even useful sub.  ... nature finds way. America first ass, like first fuck everyone else. government completely let small business owners down. see future Corporate restaurant chains organized starting 2020? fuck downvotes? none guys bother read actual CDC report vaccination prioritization recommendation? Everything said comes directly report. present modeling showing giving vaccination old folks first would save far lives, 1 3 factors used determine priority. One 2 factors (which ended far outweighing remaining two) “equity”. Giving vaccine old folks first weighted low “equity” criteria due 80+ individuals white, didn’t win. Young essential workers (while unlikely die coronavirus) racially diverse proposal kicked butt equity factor won. Also, fuck would need “cite source”? We’re talking US vaccine prioritization determined referenced CDC report. 1 fucking source, fuck would bother citing it?  Society isolate protect elderly. Look Florida competent governor vs New York incompetent governor repeatedly puts politics lives. One successful. joke. Society isn’t “age-integrated”. ridiculous pseudo intellectual piece bullshit conjecture. put things like ether expect people take seriously. People won’t able feed kids either stay closed another year. Imagine still remote options. Yeah, vaccines actually run Phase 3 trials. China &amp; Russia distributing non-rigorously tested vaccine candidates.  think I'd ever miss one too, Covid. 😣 Everything got hectic busy. I'm scared flu though, want appointment come. vulnerable attendees wedding vaccinated then, don’t see would bad idea. I’m planning going friend’s Virginia wedding May (it’s outdoors, too).  mean, would legalize make sure safe forced think would good.

Keep safe don’t make feel bad posting body making money body, that’s choice. Avoid unmaskers red hats? really feel parents small children this. kids young adults seen one year house day long year (except working grocery store scary). know that's nothing compared parents little kids dealing with. 

But science science. safe vaccine kids may need continue masks distancing, least around other, vaccine. like rest pandemic, need best what's safest people.  I’m sure varies anecdotally speaking grandpa said sense smell went overdrive hypersensitive, also said everything smelled overwhelmingly “floral” way made constantly nauseous.

My mom, hand, got COVID March still sense smell taste. said gotten 5 percent better totally gone. vaguely tell something smells strong, like bleach, even it’s nowhere near bleach used smell her.  NYT article lacks substance. Guardian article ironically states this:

 *“What appears certain first recorded cases disease China,” added Stoye. “It thus remains likely virus originated China.”* 

Hilariously, means already outdated argues not-from-China origin considering finding.

 *and consistent finding single patient Italy infected Nov)* 

A month ago argument would've identified patients November 2019. actually second confirmed case 4 year old boy Milan also Nov 2019. think two infected Italy based small scale studies they've done (and already founded cases)... well that's laughable.  piggyback that, vast majority Covid deaths people old, put bluntly, old people die. advances medical science last 150 years made great strides preventing reducing death ages, young old, even avoid everything else, age gets end. 

There’s difference perception young person dying unexpectedly accident sudden illness, ages indiscriminately dying war terror attack, old people dying disease. Couple Covid deaths outside everyday life - mostly nursing home hospital, streets - number news, loses impact. Different States different problems since something set state state basis. logistics Tripping Florida lesser extent Texas (Texas around 33% New York 36%, Florida 29%). “Zero science back this”

Should end thought process What’s rationale “delayed month?” FDA reviews teams worked basically around clock Thanksgiving turn EUAs filing. turnaround time astonishingly fast, say someone who’s worked vaccines decade. IDEA enormous drug filings are? We’re talking literally 100,000 pages documents.  real life, like way virus moves, course 23-70 million people huge effect, yes. since know many people also getting vaccine, can't really add immunity numbers.

And to. They'll immune help slow spread whether count not.  Reminds 75-85% would huge. Give Pfizer/Moderna risk J&amp;J everyone else. mention immunity thing *guaranteed least* year, year stops Oh god, read daily cases 1.25 million.
 
Good news. Right? could think ""This lesson needed, I've top every year! future kids going vaccinated! People refuse get get sick??"" Could weekend. Could lag data. infer trend single data point. oxycontin express Would add another 100M supply gets approved. Would huge does. I'm disappointed voted comment is. gonna go back normal vaccination widespread wishful thinking gonna change that. Slowing deaths getting elderly vaccinated big step gonna get airplanes restaurants full again. happen vast majority people vaccinated. I'm pretty low-risk individual.

I'm 20's without pre-existing conditions, rarely need leave house since I'm full time student.

I impression vaccines scarce, thought going able get shot late May people take priority.

From this, though, sounds like ton them. know go get mine? Po-ta-to Ugh. Another bad headline. They’re obviously referring WORLDWIDE herd immunity year, 5.5 billion people vaccinated every country. 

For literally every advanced country like United States Canada, Herd immunity reached April-July case numbers decreasing late February. Probably sooner countries got got vaccine deals distribution pipelines like Bahrain Israel great news frees vaccines countries dont significant purchase orders.

Anand said hoping bring timelines even earlier September I'd expect beginning mid summer time. Let's fucking gooooo know that. there's reason believe prevent transmission, sure. It’s not. argument simple: decide whether something legal based impact behavior.

I can’t go police get scammed buying powdered sugar told cocaine. doesn’t follow cocaine legal.

One might scammed soliciting prostitute, doesn’t mean soliciting prostitute legal. joke vaccine pandemic shut world know 34% people would take right now? That's insanity Great News

Excellent political leadership.

Maybe learned lesson. think right, forget case England, oxygen short supply [target oxygen saturation patients lowered close origin point English mutation, 50% transmissible. variant United States, yet main driver pandemic here. England, dominant strain, months. South Africa variant arose independently, somewhat similar.

No disagreement vaccination starting impact hospitalization numbers, virus stepping game, severe strain hospital system impacts patient survival still possible. long till transwarp? thought Chinese ones 92-95% effective. thinking Russian one? keep mixing Eurasian countries' vaccines. Covid making Harambe infertile means gets ape poon wants Herman cain.jpg lose-lose. I'm wearing mask theater I'm annoyed wear mask. I'm also sitting constant reminder face might catch really shitty disease.

If I'm wearing mask I'm feeling like should. pretty good puns.  got asset, may well use it. know lady, 50, still holding together pretty good. loves sex, makes anywhere 500-1000/day. That's poverty wen pulling much coin. Depends. Much employer making employees feel safe / valued / happy. cost disinfecting might lead significantly greater gains employee output. Probably ton keep heathy though people (the anti-mask people throwing protests Target) arrested fined? minimum they're disturbing peace. 
We many Freedumb idiots. lots of, 'Ah, sure it'll grand' idiots. There's 100 million people considered essential, assure cases go vaccinated. Reddit seems struggle ""general population"" means. Almost 1 3 people vaccinated then. Look, throw carrots there, potatoes... I'm kind hoping one! told oncologist get vaccine, need clinical/hospital setting revive anaphylaxis...sigh. 

Cocooning getting *really* old, may go it! newer variants may actually better spreading. See discussion Lol antiquated saying. Even pay phones still existed haven’t cost quarter in... 25 years? Link? part still transmit vaccine. get flight Florida!

/s *lasts least year Oh, absolutely it’s important. Pre-covid sons attended local co-op, rec sports, church youth activities, etc. older son asthma vast majority people co-op (and neighborhood) anti-mask/covid, unfortunately. can’t even let kids play front anymore boy street thinks it’s funny cough son ‘joke.’ yeah, socialization important, keeping kids healthy safe year important. Let's see one gets blamed Trump.....  making claims? That’s fantastic true. We’ll 5MM day within month.  Pretty much reddit Dunning-Kruger. people ""Verified Specialist"" BS biology. saw dude marked ""Verified Specialist - PhD, Criminology""

I'm sorry, got PhD immunology even worked COVID therapies summer. published work related COVID. know fuck COVID, realistically, cancer immunology, infectious disease. pick lot faster normal person, I'm still relying knowledge experts answer big questions. teach undergrads graduate BS's biology. Sorry guys, knowledge literally laughable absolute scale. nowhere near what's required take known information synthesize quality new knowledge situation. know general public, that's almost *more* dangerous. far cases confirmed transmission surfaces, science perspective probably not. 

That said business yields customers, 30% population cares enough worth them. Looks like circular reasoning me, I'm things.  guess that’s good news? fellow Canadians means expect hit September deadline without additional doses??    CDC's take these, June Anyone robbed committing crime can’t go police without fear arrest. bearing whether behaviors criminal, see reason soliciting prostitution exception. big [citation needed] accusations racial discrimination vaccine prioritization here. 

The priority queue sorted likelihood given immunization positively impact overall pandemic. Medical workers much likely contract COVID-19, likely get worse case contract it, likely spread patients asymptomatic likely cause operational problems miss work due illness.

It makes complete sense first line, prevent health system collapse roll vaccines people entirely occupational practical reasons. Vaccinating essential workers prevent many cases, vaccinating old folks save far lives. That’s exactly debatable, death rate thing like 0.00001% kids 14 way ~15% people 85. Holy shit you’re still pushing this. READING PROJECTION WRONG. I'd add dashes, think funny! recall Newsom point. can’t anything right. We’ve closed near 10 months vaccination effort screwed up.

Makes sense timeline doses important number point. plus hopefully J+J Oxford would put us respectable place. hope pattern global one. Maybe reason incidence flu low year top social distancing/mask wearing, record % people ALSO getting flu vaccine? flu vaccine reduces chance getting flu, also reduces severity flu. similarly covid, asymmetric risk severe cases/death based age, follows U shaped curve (more risk really young really old), vs. covid exponential shape (significantly risk get older). Getting flu vaccine protecting yourself, also helping protect people around reducing hospital load (similar arguments everyone take covid seriously, wear masks, social distance, get covid vaccine).

Your logic going shit people say future enough people get covid vaccine reach herd immunity, 25 year old come reddit say 'I'm going get covid vaccine, get it? IFR 25 year old lower covid flu, already reached herd immunity, even get it, chance dying low since everyone else around vaccinated, there's significant risks giving someone else, need get it. chance dying car accident way get vaccine higher dying covid'.

Sad latter possible. fun begins literally asked one what’s point doctor then. didn’t say anything optimistic, could noise/bad data. timeline makes sense point *very* small signal tease data (nursing home vaccinations starting roll late December/first days January 8 10 days grant immunity first case cases going hospital). 

Keep mind nursing home population - highest priority target - US less 2 million people made third deaths (and probably least 10% hospitalizations). last Friday, vaccinated 600K (or third) first dose. obviously vaccines delivered Friday effect today, point we're getting material numbers high risk people - start present data coming days/weeks. years, renew online WA. 1000% Definitely last night grandma Texas.

Throw lemonade slushees I’m there! 😆 I’ve staring home, much shopping online, always wearing mask outside house go basically everything actual public health experts said do.

CAN FUCKING VACCINE PLEASE?! prove love China downvote you. I'm guessing distinction different languages made recently (given source same, Christopher Columbus / Cristóbal Colón). surprise English name Colombia was, one time, Columbia, like Puerto Rico used Porto Rico English, still French. Speaking French, still use word: Colombie country Colombie Britannique British Columbia, example. Spanish Wikipedia gives spelling using ""Colombia"" alternative BC, too. Interesting, thanks. since I’m studied area wonder it’s better give many 1, half dose, reserve 2 half many people full dose.

Getting 1 shot would start vaccination supply doesn’t meet demand happens? start get another 2 second isn’t received within required window? Agreed. stupid. Also, see lot people talking covid vaccine required pre travel well require majority people don’t even access yet?  It’s well documented hospitals make money diagnosing people coronavirus instead flu

Source: Jensen said, “Hospital administrators might well want see COVID-19 attached discharge summary death certificate. Why? straightforward, garden-variety pneumonia person admitted hospital – they're Medicare – typically, diagnosis-related group lump sum payment would $5,000. COVID-19 pneumonia, $13,000, COVID-19 pneumonia patient ends ventilator, goes $39,000.""*

Another source: got pretty much everyone ER got both. issues us. one  random sampling facebook feed, I'd say half friends nursing it. working hospital setting, closer 100% sure got information Canada was:

Pfizer (4th country order) 
Moderna (3rd country order) 
Novavax - 3rd 
J&amp;J - 3rd 
Sanofi-GSK - sure expecting Q4  
Medicargo - 1st 
Oxford - close front 


So right Oxford Sanofi-GSK wrong everything else. provide source information would happy change mind. hell even ""actual first world country"" see problem pronouncing names local language, even different origin. Many places this; Japan example top head.

Just call leader China ""Eleven Jinping"" fine lol Disneyland open since March. 

The Downtown Disney shopping area open though.  exception US UK (who produce vaccines), Canada pace rest western countries. 

Source: find much camaraderie then. Sad truth probably got thrown trash. want thank people either give gift cards, sealed food, offer pay catered food delivery. Truly hope y’all aren’t eating home made food people know know personally/trust. Excellent question. Biden believes attempt vaccinate everyone. in, don’t hold back dose shot 2. Give supply fast hope production allow us get people back second shot time. break CDC today, dose set aside every dose administered, appointment scheduled follow get second. Basic math think we’ll start see numbers go since there’s lot less people gathering December holidays old news? could save 30,000 lives/year eternity would cost everything makes life worth living.  hell taking long gonna get vaccinated yet right still phase 1 front line currently  Would great could get one. huge orders, mean came time.

There handful factories around world make doses, dozens countries want many possible.

Pfizer moderna (and others soon) deals different countries divide fairly.

The USA getting fair share supply, small rich nations like Israel Bahrain paid lot per dose get quickly.

As is, Canada vaccinate ""all adults want it"" September based Pfizer moderna orders Alone. 

But Canada made deals 7 different companies, least 2 get trials complete next month.

If get 4,5, 6 different deliveries parallel, may significantly speed things up.  hard....  yet willing bet majority Americans neither. new coronavirus cases United States rise precipitously holidays, health experts urging states federal government speed up vaccine distribution, proved a logistical nightmare.

“In large metro areas Boston, Washington, D.C., Houston, need vaccinating least 10,000 people every day next eight months stay target,” vaccine expert Peter Hotez wrote Washington Post. “We even close that,” added.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah sort shocked this. Even surgeon friend mine get mad saying flu factor overwhelming hospitals, credit changed tune soon stated reasoning behind it.

If we're even mildly impacting COVID, we're crushing flu. exponential process sides R0 = 1, predictably crazy high flu vaccination rates year. I'll give shot that's holdup Yeah, day come together humans celebrate remember collective stupidity. Lol idk tickled imagined non-spanish speaker one typed well positive intention lol Good god piece work. People like much problem, defending shitty logic long drawn responses dont amount really saying anything substance. Peace. even started yet Australia. Probably late Feb/ early March. downvotes tell people don’t understand lol take flu shots every year 60% effective, also UK averaged 70 considering two full dose population 1 1/2 population. could also make circular argument medical care jack theres food anyone working supply food. everyone important. expert herd immunity summer probably doable since need 60-70% population vaccinated infected. 20% America covid data look promising still big assumption get approved. I'm doctor can't evaluate study setup trial data. Preliminary results different final results. sound like Fermat Last Evans said evolutionary biologists believe making jump animal human populations, endemic coronaviruses mutated centuries strike pathogenic balance ensuring effective transmission person person, without virulent kill projects COVID-19 virus could follow similar evolutionary path, said process could compressed shorter period time ""vaccine-induced herd immunity"" would limit pool potential hosts favour transmissible less virulent versions ""We speed process adapting population new virus using vaccines ... wait 100 years become sort low-grade endemic coronavirus causes cold-like syndrome wintertime around meant vaccine process, disaster past year. would 1/21 different 1/12 vaccinations?

I’m quizzing you, curious little discussed media. different plan Biden’s czar today’s?  WAG, good drug distribution network due prescription drug abuse?

But government competent, maybe easier get program going smaller population state. looks like they're distinguishing ""clinical efficacy"" (78%) ""general efficacy"" (50-60%), I'm sure difference is.  [LA zoo tested gorillas’ fecal samples two began coughing Wednesday, zoo said news release. Preliminary results returned Friday showed animals tested positive, U.S. Department Agriculture laboratories confirmed results Monday, zoo said.

Anyway, many infections go unnoticed depends many tested. vary *a lot* different countries different points. even true US cannot simply take number apply places.

For example Spring lot cases went unnoticed simply enough capacity test people. second wave test capacity expanded 10x, course much cases found now. Yeah see he'd saying that, like ""would interesting thing experiment"" No, inconvenience.

I’ll impressed headline reading “People work working home receive vaccine.” That's....exactly article says. try reading getting upset it? did. don’t think it’s enough sound alarm bells I'll echo posters... issue?

Completely earnest, arguing several posters yet properly explain trying say. think multiply CDC numbers 100. love outraged despite agreeing article. title gave small heart attack... yes please Considering covid last 6 months people never covid, sounds like good idea vaccination. goes rest years! Leave alone never started according lot people. Well played sir. Can't tell last time I've those. US following similar strategy UK, vaccinating elderly vulnerable first? studies reddit lives parrot highly biased. do. country buy J&amp;J vaccines really hope shows good results, hoping best! K, I'll keep looking. agree different states different challenges. California huge ones, done relatively well. 

Especially specific parts. SF second-most dense city country NYC. Daily public transportation double city's population includes most-ridden bus like nation (Geary-38). done well major city US. 

Why? sorts factors. things complicated. can't look one thing isolation. Promoting /= mandating.   people state come get vaccine NY? anyone know?  Yeah, people think get flu yearly reality people get legit flu around 5 times entire life.

A flu still 10x worse bad cold. clicked this, deleted posts normal posts Insurers aren’t directly influenced whether states give permission. Obviously discussions can’t happen authorities allow events, point focus exclusively risk exposure comes potential claims. States say it’s fine shows long companies would bear brunt inaccuracy.  Things much back normal elderly vaccinated. That’s point. sure expected kids online learning going school extreme precautions till least 2023 pretty sad get attention anymore balance rights. think rights sufficiently trampled now. one sided, covid deaths matter quality life not? can't lock people forever. Radio saying two day long. sure hygiene can't also thing either, so... best thing make sure people don’t die get hurt en masse right patient. think temporarily lowerd life expect 20 years lower half year so... bunc cemetaries burst deaths around time, escpecially among young women obviously ww1, Fuck off, consumerist society rich people imposed upon us, human nature. something enjoy, doesn’t feel like work. intentions take two people getting vaccinated convince republicans get jab, it’d worth imo. could've known masks, social distancing, hand-washing protected flu, right? /s may helpful age breakdown. got couple bucks , saying. thank social media/dating apps destructive influence prior normalcy. dating site data shows downward spiral around time Tinder became popular. California earliest community spread. also earliest stay-at-hime orders. 

It sounds like penalizing California control long periods time despite early spread, instead crediting it. 

Why? Yeah, Ireland! anyone else notice Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker 1 million people vaccinated yesterday...we’re making big progress folks! Fukkkkkk poor dudes, hope hit hard humans Also getting vaccinated thing so... Yeah, think similarities see US overlap anti-vaxxers anti-maskers/COVID deniers. Since disease exist overblown, need vaccine. Add group likely believe conspiracy theories general. Aint grandmas da best!? up-to-date, reliable data regarding correlation schools community transmission? many scratchers would buy hitting jackpot? I'm really sure find state. 

I would guess somewhere census website lot reports. don’t agenda that’s mean. can’t find positive story Florida coronavirus even Florida papers.

Black Widow first major release restrictions lifted absolute best case scenario movie's box office. mean unless personal servants go grocery store, whatever chore need get done, even emergency never really going 100% socially distant. Even hypothetical, still interacting people.

Don't kid reason getting vaccinated ""I'm socially distancing anyways, what's point"". Chances probably gotten anyways. following experts advice socially distancing, also follow advice getting vaccinated. can't pick choose aspect science belive in. Isn’t idea adults vaccinated, it’s fairly safe kids go back “normal” life? least that’s pediatrician stated. true way handcuffed it. 100% free thought best given ability distribute vaccine. can't one thinking fucks collective mental health regular porn? Might been, perhaps waiting test results others come back positive included reporting. clarify, mean initial cases say ""got hit"". whatever reason (you could claim better restrictions, weather, less seeding, seeing Italy strain - posited infectious), CA see explosion cases March like parts country (NY, NJ, IL, etc). deadliest period date, better treatment methods determined yet. Even summer, south exploding (and would better treatments, yet now), CA pretty well control.

Now, nearly year, CA seeing first real surge. seen large portion deaths surge, cases (maybe) beginning plateau. top that, point making likely end lower list otherwise would have, fact surge coming relatively late means relatively fewer deaths (essentially, IFR lower due better treatment). Wow would thought novel virus would spread easily virus 50% vaccination coverage... Immunity extent hospitalized expected, absolute latest, five weeks first dose around 95% people. According almost million people nursing homes, make 38% deaths, begun getting vaccinated- that's half nursing home patients, give take hundred thousand.

Even pretend millions got vaccinated got first dose, one gets vaccine today, got slightly slower Moderna vaccine, immunity kick five weeks now, would very, noticeable drop daily deaths mid February, yes.

And getting faster here. might vaccinate half vaccine eligible population March, point pandemic would essentially huge deal since we're prioritizing vulnerable. We're going see point large number hospitalized people people refused vaccine. conversation around restrictions going change soon. exciting good news. need little common sense respect. employers give paid sick leave fire someone actually using it. able afford contact-free grocery delivery. able wear mask without getting side-eye people. Santa Claus, know none things think happen ever will.  Pyeongchang 2018: ""Phew, close!""

21% Florida 65 15% California. first approximation would 33% deaths Florida. 

The way get decent estimate though would look age stratification IFR state cannot find age stratification state. could said almost every. single. state. Florida bad, amirite? looking positive stories Florida haven’t found yet. Newfoundlander here. hard lockdown March till June. living pretty normally besides wearing mask. also able gather Christmas 20 people surge cases 2 weeks. People back working offices since July/august kids back school outbreaks settings. Feel like definitely living different world No, means sick. one really wore masks sick. It'll probably socially acceptable now. Yes agree first lockdown. probably good idea formulate strategy. governments lost plot, scale testing, allowed infinite travel without checks, messing vaccinating expect people accept next lockdownie? unreasonable expect wide enough support point. messed bad I'd much willing.

They asked flatten curve. helped flatten curve. I'll accept risk, would even sign low priority ICU, let me. functioning society more. wish Hollywood would stop pretending Nomadland theater release February 19th start streaming now. annoying likely Best Picture Oscar winner isn’t available watch. It’s going “over” well herd immunity. Heck people already consider over. scenes Les Miserables showed quite well horrible poverty sex work imo. Florida deaths per 1 million pop 40% higher California.

Plateauing level exactly great lol euh, no, exactly... mutations talking artificially added researchers. substituted two amino acids S1 domain proline (a rigid one) making prefusion structure spike protein stable. Basically spike protein changes structure comes contact ACE2 receptor cell (post-fusion form, looking bit like needle), helps virus enter cell.

People selfish dumb like previous post states. bad society pulls strings businesses governments. wear mask say required else suffer consequences. Yup. Sorry. Chinese kinda rusty 🤣 48,000 US combat dead entirety Vietnam war. 30,000 1 state pretty big. guess Palestinians left out? two weeks Price hardly factor countries like Canada Korea. Getting pandemic fast possible matters. Pay extra bucks potential dose. Hospitals become huge hotspots. Better safe sorry. many vulnerable people getting treated health status able cope infection. Sorry. Chinese little rusty. Honestly think day remembrance. millions died COVID, medical workers died treating survived suffer PTSD decades come. 

While vaccine wonderful achievement, effects pandemic permanent millions families. I've never left home since March without mask despite rural area. 

Still caught covid standard yearly colds. like fashion aspect. That's all. I’ll cut quick everybody: we’re able go get hammered bar we’re still sending kids school masks plexi glass September parents going lose minds, included. “Back normal” September better caveat schools still mess we’re imposing annoying day day restrictions kids adults living up. That’s non-starter. shame obviously gets downvoted. Accepting truth seems difficult people I’ve never gotten flu vaccine life year hopped quick possible! i’ve ever gotten flu 10 years ago know getting vaccinated help hospitals around incase get flu. exciting! going keep ramping up, too. J&amp;J, Novavax etc get approved next couple months, we’ll solid supply, distribution gonna bottleneck. wouldn’t surprised see regularly hit 2 million/day time get week two February. Yeah. flu shot rates up. invited wedding late May Cincinnati. 


I’ll Phase C vaccinations Georgia, probably won’t vaccinated then, don’t know. 


The wedding probably unlikely happen good idea, right? y’all think? lack evidence doesn’t default presuming something risk much ""lockdown"" here. Schools get waivers, still open, outdoor dining November even indoor dining limited capacity awhile summer. salons open. Gyms operating outside - still are. Stores open capacity restrictions. mall open still, right now.

We pretty good summer, may part problem people thought real, thought was, could take risk. 

Then holidays started. Business restrictions much family spread. parents 60+ able schedule vaccine appointments due medical transport company volunteer with. grandma who’s also 85 made appointment.

When parents got site, site turned away. “No volunteers get tested, employees payroll organizations”. office workers patient contact able get vaccine, volunteers streets.

I also couple friends 20s white collar workers NYC hospitals, working home since March, continue so, received vaccine simply hospital employees. 

Vaccine roll-out NY State total disaster. People trying get it, excess sits refrigerators many people opting receiving it. feels like soon China New Zealand succeeded lockdowns, entire western world became obsessed them. started counting every COVID death death could prevented. We're never gonna get situation set bar incredibly high. We're harm good point. think sick, stay home. sick go out, wear mask. people want wear mask entirety flu season, applauded inconveniencing help decrease risk spreading flu.

You say shit hindsight, that's easy, fact SARS-CoV-1 came China wetmarkets many diseases. yet hear one single disease came Italy recent time, whereas mention 3 top head coming straight China recently.

The fact Wuhan completely shut people literally welded homes first reported case even found Italy. that, first Italian case found, came **Chinese travelers**. sure, coincidence.

""citing two sources seen results"" could two informants anti-China sentiment scientifically trained picked &lt;60% statistic somewhere thick report. Let's wait explanation efficacy calculated actual number is.

For one thing, Moderna Pfizer trials look asymptomatic infections. efficacies calculated basis symptomatic, PCR-confirmed cases. preliminary data Moderna vaccine may reduced asymptomatic cases two-thirds. Sinovac's &lt;60% efficacy calculated way make comparable Moderna's two-thirds. would quite reasonable. 78% reduction symptomatic disease, &lt;60% reduction asymptomatic cases. That’s think need get bottom of: what’s going expectation? statements saying won’t data then. Yet we’re talking normal sorts things fall. Getting August told “yeeeeeaaahhh...guess what, it’s back misery, kids!” won’t met kindly. 

I’m nervous vaccines preventing least good chunk transmission 1) they’re highly effective would odd prevent least 2) public management standpoint can’t vaccinated ripping masks celebration rest us back line. You’d riots outside every CVS country. It’d pandemonium.

I don’t think covid disappearing anywhere. School, work, name it. isn’t recipe distancing masks forever though. 50% (and yes, high) cannot explain spike. 50% also spiking one thinks Covid actually getting eradicated. likely wind seasonal illness. thousands people dying daily percent vaccines distributed versus administered bad.... they’ll go back non-existent social lives without satisfaction feeling morally superior everyone social life fun games kid dies crippled long term symptoms. parent, us favor shoulder costs yourself. nevermind read wrong......glad getting vaccinated makes sense me. Hopefully come eventually.  I'm crossing fingers shows good efficacy E484K too... Recommendation people already gotten sick get vaccinated. It'll case since people dumb selfish. I'm idea risking kid catching COVID long term crap real. ensure everyone vaccinated protect kids? can't. Therefore ""relatively"" safe illusion safety people willing look deeper into. don’t get life back spreading CoVID19 more, that’s works. evidence based article. Please take crap down. sister go opening day every year itching get back AT&amp;T, sorry Oracle, Park watch Giants stomp Dodgers...well least watch Giants play baseball. right ya! put order bunch different vaccines different companies. vaccines work, need one dose, excess poorer countries.  Well that’s dumb hell.

Hospital staff working 80 hour weeks, it’s time pretend like nothing happening. Best comment I’ve read 2021 LOL russian vaccine uses adenovirus delivery method. develop immune response adenoviruses using two types (Ad5 Ad26) theoretically circumvents somewhat problem developing antibodies adenovirus carries spike protein vaccine. here's reading Yeah, well, ever try get mask gorilla? Ok everyone quit eating like dumbass load fiber.  yep...anaphylaxis flu shot 7 years ago, infusion reaction chemo severe latex allergy...kind pinning hopes J&amp;J one shot point! Okay well fuck then. care anymore long get point. guess makes sense say ""vá com Deus"" . Guess flying knew vaccines going available months now. need doctor jabs. Anyone day two's training could model deliberately limited. language used ""only protection **of vaccine recipients** infection (vs. transmission) considered."" (emphasis added)

Someone would died, get vaccinated thus get sick: model looked at, counted potential infection prevented life saved. someone would gotten sick, passed disease elderly aunt, *she* died it? aunt considered model, get vaccine.

It *not* attempt quantify impact reduced spread. 70-year-old man lives nursing home? vaccinating make him, personally, less likely die; also means he's less likely infect elderly friends, potentially preventing multiple deaths.

20-year-old bus driver health problems? He's almost certainly gonna die either way. he's likely catch (if already), he's caught he's fairly likely pass bunch passengers. turn pass friends family (since live separate social circles), forth; cutting one link chain could ultimately prevent hundreds cases - - multiple deaths.

What found vaccinating elderly first would directly prevent deaths, vaccinating essential workers first would directly prevent infections. found nothing one would indirectly prevent infections deaths, trying model far. Serbia joined EU yet. Hospital completely evacuated. 464 tested negative. One doctor one nurse coworker started side effects day 4, no. Forgive dumb question I’m Canadian, isn’t population Canada like 30-40 million? would need 400 million doses? Again, trying start anything. General question.   still get fast pass Space Mountain fast pass good vaccine? Oh shit read cases lmao Crazy impossible. Evolution wonderful. many schools, precaution masks required. even that. Think idiots we'd cleanse. Sadly We'd good people die makes almost worth it. BUT, we'd better planet. Oh yeah, vaccine trial ended believe. Depends live. got mine urgent care center, injected less 5 day (it 5pm). Current vaccines cause infection, actual virus. Right now, know vaccines extremely effective preventing disease, Moderna seemingly 100% effective preventing serious disease. Studies done transmission, likely transmission greatly drops.

Children also small risk getting MIS-C. rare justify prioritizing them, significant enough studies vaccinating children. Hopefully vaccinating adults also leads fewer COVID cases children meantime.  Man, living Tennessee, know Mike Wisowski feels 😕 sure is, people things like:

-	Travelling holidays insane percent did
-	wearing cloth masks suck never washing rewear them
-	90% Americans don’t know wash hands properly
-	social distancing isn’t sufficient enclosed spaces poor ventilation, let alone fact crowded stores months across Canada America, suspect western world


Key word proper. people *properly* necessary steps STILL barely limit R.0. remindme! 30 days Australia also mostly eliminated flu without much mask wearing country must measures like social distancing here. Throw rushrooms let’s get baby moving anyone planning going outside house 14 days? said ""by fall"", ""until fall"". Anti-vax propaganda filled misinformation. read infections first months trained see despair every post. Finally good news. also related demographic. grocery store going broader mix general populis. compare Walmart Whole Paycheck I'd imagine see difference well. Bay area I've even seen clerks Safeway using megaphones remind people proper mask wearing. Yet citation actual agency responsible testing, fact clear rebuttal them. Yet choose believe source posted actual test results, speculation. I'm sure news gullible, way here. People choice, when's last time picked specific flu vaccine received? 

Also, least US, supply Moderna Pfizer combined enough inoculate significant enough percentage people well next year. 

We absolutely need third hopefully fourth option want begin recovery process sooner later. J&amp;J getting ballpark 70%-80% efficacy single shot, highly scalable technology would end pandemic, incoming efficacy figures critical. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Biden's big business anti worker hold breath. going fast vaccines $$$ involved PPE last year? Intramuscular means muscle, find vein like would draw blood. Makes much easier. Good would isolating full 14 days (and that, non-symptomatic testing pretty much irrelevant). Testing day 8 stopping isolation lowers risk, means 0. vectors possible mutation :/ Noooooooooooooooooooo right! Thanks catching  strictly reduce strain hospitals!

...unless people get cocky start celebrating early, even vaccinated yet. Obviously social distancing still thing, herd immunity still goal. mutation occurs makes vaccine useless, mRNA takes swapping code generate target protein. would done weeks.

Approval another issue, though could expedited like flu vaccine since would basically identical except specific code. mostly drive walk areas spaced parking lot. you’re given appointment time. it’s 12k people sitting stands waiting haha that's really best thing do. get major city. cost living feels like needlessly higher, know, that's price pay bunch people around amenities. I'm one know plenty people age 25-35 single am. even usually break up. Best luck. Wow Maybe drive vaccinations.    
That’s would expect haven’t heard.  bleak, feds told Quebec many vaccines Quebec would get. Stop spreading anti-vax misinformation. Yep. me. I’ll waiting Oxford jnj. don’t believe anything bad guaranteed happen mRNA also trust less others might well wait. Curious confidently say rarely causes death versus flu? apples orange comparison given masks social distancing place previous flu seasons? Isn’t though? said crazy people don’t think covid real Crap. Condolences. depends test.

vaccination result positive PCR antigen test.

once developed immune response vaccination, *may* positive antibody test.  Anyone seen Utopia 2020 tv show? me? Ok. immunity need start, though? lay person, I'd feel matter virus multiplying low level vaccine thing teach body fight it? No, Canada trying get quickly possible. Production still ramping up, we're back line like conservative narrative trying push. havent done 2 hours practice yet dont know makes easier harder, cant hard don’t time next one crashing. Every U.S. House representative Seante member quarantine immediately receive COVID-19 tests. People clustered together hours, GOP reps refused wear masks. Well decide pandemic hits home, alot places nearly deaths, deaths far, brought in. Alot people got vaccined now, millions world, vaccine deadly would huge problem hands, would obvious.

On side note, website overcrowded misinformation. issue Canada regarding everything covid solely premiers provinces. blame LTC deaths daily case numbers, reason awful vaccination rate. Ontario talking giving one shot premier fucking dumb ass brother Toronto's late former crack smoking mayor.

We talking giving one shot... Man thread filled misinformation. We're ""Just time"" delivery vaccines, thing countries doing. long feds stick schedule, everyone getting shots. 

Ontario great given amount vaccines have. LTC homes high risk areas ahead schedule even hospitals ran vaccines Toronto weekend. course numbers show still doses available lot probably rural areas harder administer waiting administered second doses (for people need second dose next delivery) time we’re able require vaccine things would offered everyone. Meaning remaining without vaccine innocent sense turned vaccine. believe vaccine intramuscular too. worry that. That's extremely unlikely, happen there's nothing could anyway. Save stress. patient died less 24hs application, way. state falsehood much certainty? thought proven true, actual doctors saying antibodies last least 8 months people - they’ve able track long. stating falsehoods truth big problem society today. 75 percent nova scotia done fall.. they're already exceeding plan, think promise low land high type dealio. Sorry, I’ll edit 2020s avoid confusion. And.... unfortunately, cases.... leadership lawmakers determine capitalize opportunity presented us. Let’s also award shit post ppl know important person THANK YOU! somebody shed light this? ""efficacy"" **definite** meaning? thought meant ""The vaccine prevents positive PCR test"" i.e ""if get vaccine, even exposed positive""

Brazil something lines of, [""Sinovac said us, patient needs show least 1-2 symptomps count positive ""efficacy"" standards same, compare numbers vaccine numbers vaccines?  COVID seems barely affect children, childhood immunisation might less important smallpox? Yes, get percentage. CDC's numbers 1. [Three Stooges sure would vaccinating teachers greater priority front line essential workers. protecting teachers students. teacher sees 100 student day cashier sees 100 customers day, teacher get cashier. Yes educating future generation important, getting food table die. happening, occupations putting risk. deserve lower risk others? Frontline essentially workers, distribute age. want divide occupation, make fair. mean, elderly mass vaccinated, society reopen much faster, yes... Bro, even America? study done? I'm sure 60-70% protection would good enough new transmissible strains going around nowadays.  media rollout. think otherwise? OK, I'll bite slow day work.

Obviously grocery store important. else think open hard lockdown like see? huge news needs posted! Pfizer Moderna included asymptomatic cases. didn’t perform surveillance testing find asymptomatic cases. Since people aren’t getting testing without symptoms, don’t data many/if asymptomatic cases occurred among test groups mean, would happy that. 

But workers rely people coming office win, downstream suppliers. 

Hoping something middle Biden incoming POTUS old, pretty important gets vaccinated. Similarly Mike Pence, current VP United States. reason outrage there. Good point. Young people get vaccine first.

WTF! lot counted AZ/Oxford first, easier, hopefully things move faster February. Moderna easy storage too, lot doses available. Preparation lacking unfortunately. protect yourself. Cool. Basic Algebra called, want know equations linear ones Oh thank god former deck contestant got shot. read first 3 words, thought former deck contestant died something!!?!?? Former deck contestant god send needs protected times!!!!! 😱 hope right think saying 1.25MM day cause recorded yesterday completely wrong. 2 days like 300k. can't cherry pick.

And 60% lot growth. say sorry 5k deaths uneccessary? 55? 55 year olds still workplace many underlying conditions put especially risk

Because vaccine production yet: we're still early stages triaging gets it. almost certainly open progressively-younger people rollout continues.  It’s actually reasonable. Especially vox. 
I’d contend line masks commercial cost absolutely false. think they’re deterrent people participating lot activities. Think theme parks, theaters, festivals, fairs, etc. Obviously people participate hard time believing you’ll see people excited go masked date movies something associate enjoyment.  Besides, open bars gets confusing you’d require many places point. Nobody putting mask sips. earth vaccinating people SIGNIFICANTLY greater risk hospitalization death going materially change number people dying hospitalized? Ohio 67% hospitalizations people 60 older. 46% 70% older. eliminated well half hospitalizations vaccinating 65 older crowd. 79% deaths Ohio 70 older. lowering vaccinating 65 older crowd.

You aren’t trying understand best strategy. It’s clear evident needs done prevent hospitalizations deaths. stubborn best strategy isn’t benefit. Arnold S. Monto, MD chaired @U.S. Food Drug Administration's Vaccines Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meetings December led emergency use authorization (EUA) Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. joins JAMA's Q&amp;A series @University Michigan School Public Health discuss experience date 2 products what's next vaccine development.

California they've opened sign medical staff, public-facing not, i'm sure best course considering elderly 75+ still waiting shots. masks horrible virus loaded cloths cold weather. Wet nasty. dip salt preserve forever?!!!!!  Cool, every famous person getting vaccine front page newsworthy? coronavirus, Ison says, "" 'herd immunity' seen somewhere 60% 70% population degree protection.""  — here's little math — 20% U.S. population ends getting exposed virus developing infection vaccine (as [estimated level immunity New York City metro area right would still need additional 40% population gain protection via vaccine.  order get 40% population immune vaccination — vaccine 50% efficacy — ""you're going vaccinate 80% population,"" says [Carlos del infectious disease expert Emory University. ""So going happen right would really valid people getting COVID about. COVID transmissions happen private gatherings. *probably* getting COVID bus driver. getting Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, people low key drinks, etc... 

The hard contact tracing data NYC bares out, 74% infections private gatherings less 15% directly work. anecdotal data, everyone getting tested 2x/week university work at, despite spending 8 hours/day other, one passing COVID around. People get COVID individually, ""mysteriously"" 2-3 people friend group, work shift. Another anecdote: hair stylist COVID gave 50+ haircuts transmit single case.

The majority happening work, small amount justify delaying getting vaccines vulnerable population. best bang buck vaccinating age. Chipmunks ... L V N !!! country even date start. panic felt first read name Crazy Covid already November knowbody knew hugging, kissing, going football, concerts etc. Makes sense increase beginning crazy. think already know last winter? Personally I’m burning masks second they’re longer required. worry they'll point death count (which remain high due back-counting) reason keep restrictions place even hospitalizations case rates (which tracked much closer real-time) drop. Anything ~1% considered control scalable contact tracing. effectively control. everyone commented, staying away news since January 6th sake mental health, saw this. 

I’ll interested seeing whether Cuomo sticks this. it. state (California) handling vaccines poorly that's frustrating see light end tunnel know could much closer.  Also part trial. Received injection hour half ago symptoms report. soreness injection site, nothing. straight forward works doesn't. vaccines may 50% efficacy, however, may reduce hospitalisations serious symptoms 100%. We're 9.3MM vaccines administered yesterday current run-rate 1.25MM vaccines/day. number continue ramp ramp bigly states follow updated guidance hold back second dose. Back-of-the-envelope, could hit 50MM vaccines administered average rate daily vaccinations grows 60%. could better updated guidance. Anyone American West knows N95s gold standard. September wildfire smoke passed right regular mask completely stopped N95. smell, difficulty breathing, like magic. vaccine far data show transmission prevented herd immunity, sense transmission, achieved. Entitled fucking idiots. Believe me, want even mild case. Covid end becoming chronic. vaccine also showing likelihood working strains virus. friend second round Covid, (had antibodies round) interesting, thank you.  many different percentages vaccine...Well, assuming data correct, least 100% effective severe cases, that's positive.

Does anybody know whether Brazil-only data? Turkey said 91.25% efficacy, Indonesia 65% Brazil 50%. bit nebulous tho, understand numbers particularly large enough make solid conclusions. doubt effect symptom severity, know say 100% time yet. here, already seeing signs. ""No returning normal"" rhetoric everywhere. co-worker, two weeks ago said absolutely *not* get vaccine, asked parking information vaccination center! last holdout nursing unit. I'm optimistic time goes people initially resistant come around. helth dont like 444 upvotes... spooky :/ I'm really trying understand say that. Transmission associated deaths children largely mitigated keeping home. real data tell us happens go back school regardless vaccinated adults.

Also bearing mind going large percentage population get vaccinated kids... Oh thank god. Let’s let live forever never need live reality best news flair asap! country, people always saying ""children safe, BUT..."" finding rare example kids still might risk. make suffer reason, grow fear them. wired version? CEO also said standard protocol's effectiveness goes longer delay doses, think released actual data.

The UK's MHRA released data. weeks delay doses, 82% across protocols, 75% standard protocol. exact symptoms chronic fatigue syndrome (like many long COVID patients), symptoms myocarditis, would strange go route. know Cuomo said yesterday can't keep businesses closed indefinitely waiting ""critical mass"" vaccinations, right? think NY going much hardline state people think going be. popular feature Darth Vader mode Manhattan dead. one streets. Every piece entertainment closed. offices open. every time read ""Sir David Attenborough"" reddit heart stops second. source? I'm positive studies saying right now. NY honestly much different, big. NYC, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse Albany pretty damn rural. Granted rural areas within 1-2 hours city least 100k, that's still quite hike elderly person, especially one drive. still hasn’t single documented case fomite spread SARS Cov 2. That’s say can’t happen, far evidence transmitted via respiratory droplets air. Given line everybody asking do, would stupid backtrack. got something else bring it, they'd likely need preps well... PROTECT COSTS agree you. Depends state city, expect SF continue restrictions long, long period time.

But mask stuff worries more. Go around subreddit people saying everyone wear masks flu cold season. happening. Worst outbreak months 42 new cases, I’d say pretty good usually 10-14 day lag data. hopefully won’t change.

It’s less huge implications actions. incompetency all. mean sources inside party confirm reason 24 hour delay purely didn’t look like giving Starmer teaching unions ridiculous. Cuomo's tweet yeseterday, get feeling New York gonna open back start summer. I've said ... 

Nature forty years watch Sir David explain ways. Alas sign taken necessary effort learn him. announced inevitable retirement, soon alone surrounded ""do research"" Facebook idiots. 

This going end well. Expect Japan's numbers come nicely weeks games. Actually capitalism helps eliminate poverty mechanism human history. Wealth inequality separate issue, blaming poverty capitalism wrong. clarify, mean 50.38%? something else. so, great result unfortunately. ""Weeeeernstrom"" 😠  Meanwhile back reality cuomo said yesterday think widespread across country, fear going certain urban ""islands"" restrictions end placing high degree emphasis ""semblance"" part ""semblance normalcy."" I'm thinking mask mandates particular whose costs, real, hard quantify. Mankind's treasure needs preserved!   Thank fuck 2nd dose timed properly 1st basically wasted That's issue healthcare. They're 99% cases go absolutely fine, they're small number cases someone adverse reaction

If go anaphylaxis, wan't someone 2 days training. Pramila Jayapal, Washington state Democrat, said statement early Tuesday quarantining since attack learned positive test result Monday night. ""Only hours President Trump incited deadly assault Capitol, country, democracy, many Republicans still refused take bare minimum COVID-19 precaution simply wear damn mask crowded room pandemic — creating superspreader event top domestic terrorist attack."" “I share outrage anger constituents across country watched Donald Trump fail combat raging pandemic refuse take care Americans suffering, dying, devastated. official data anything, brother's doctor parents caught it, said observations there's ""danger point"" 5 days 10 days symptoms first show, times symptoms suddenly worsen. said could keeping that. Hes respiratory infectious disease specialist, he's noticed patients. could always walk drive place place. may sound accusatory German. like ""the variant Britain"" even ""the British variant"" sound accusatory English ears. Olay think rounding 80+ percent say almost perfectly reasonable. response saying they’re accurate/helpful farther truth. serious note, reason able mutate different strains minks thousands minks mink farms giving virus plenty generations mutate adapt. Even every gorilla earth caught covid time mutate single mink farm. Kids aren’t vaccinated yet (nor susceptible). 70% adult population 178.5 million. Subtract 23 million already covid. could realistically 78 days heard immunity even can’t get 2m doses day.  Yes, agree seen facts. ""deadliest"" equate ""almost all"". Good. need ""I'm sure see, I'm going go see crash. Kids, get car"" accurate Well kids cancer can’t get vaccines year finish trestment. rely herd immunity. also bioNtech/Pfizer vaccine? different one? Children still hospitalised flu, children vaccinated, think UK give primary school children. Covid death rates kids very, low, believe number single digits UK. say tragic course, kids still die normal times, acceptable limit risk. mad let kid socialise adults vaccinated imo genuinely surprised numbers cars road went exercise. thought pandemic all

Compared April last year like 28 days later like 1/5th number active cases. US administrated 9,268,879 doses, Israel administrated 1,870,652. Aggregating small arms countries different circumstances work. AstraZeneca problem. 98% survivability flu get zero love  can't comment lateral flow PCR definitely not, test highly specific. No, thank taking time reply ;)

So understood correctly, side effects need manifest first weeks following vaccine, haven’t that, it’s safe say patient never (with specific vaccine course)? Brazil, Russia reported immune compromised woman producing super mutated variants. Great news! Even though got rocky start, hope vaccination process start go smoother smoother time goes confused. read title “infections” “vaccinations” like “who asshole cheering record infections?!” still factor Pfizer Moderna require two shots, pretty much double every estimate. I'm hoping alternatives approved require single shot 90-95% efficacy.

I'm 65 exactly get guess thought would vaccinated April May I'd happy dance. saying people sick underlying medical conditions less likely die prisoners severe illnesses?  Well, OP clearly insider informations wants leak out! many those, live vaccine safe immuno-compromised, pregnant women get discussion physician, adults excluded people known severe allergies vaccine ingredients. people kids would rely herd immunty. can't really get sick one around sick. J&amp;J trail results expected next couple days. AZ J&amp;J successful, enough vaccines 540mil. people September. Twice much need reach herd immunity. Phoenix currently reading higher numbers every category, compared Tucson.

http://www.azdhs.com/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/infectious-disease-epidemiology/covid-19/dashboards/index.php According data Centers Disease Control Prevention, COVID-19 deadliest among older populations. fact, December 23, 92 percent COVID-19 deaths nationwide occurred among ages 55 older. 0.2 percent younger 25. trend also found state level. go! they’re following previous trends, they’d want release efficacy results early Monday morning effect it’ll share prices, Monday stock market holiday may see Friday week Tuesday next week. I'd say simply they're reporting correctly. treatable. husband got antibiotic Bactrim. stopped taking antibiotic received IVIG &amp; steroids IV 3.5 days ICU fine. Possibly since it’s vaccine, vaccine can’t stopped like oral medication treatments couldn’t keep up? Thanks captain. work whole treatment die. Given much US invests military, actually use good efficacy dating coming within week.

do source? spike selfish people new varient. I'm Irish witnessed first hand idiotic decisions family members neighbours act like virus didnt exist Christmas time. Ah sure grand! see 40-45 people day office primary physician. I’ve kinda list vaccination weeks zero people health dept clue what’s going on. Cmon Florida get shit together  would really depressing next 29 February three years away think pretty confident point true asymptomatic cases bad spreading, study found symptomatic cases infected 19% household asymptomatic 0.7%. quite researches suggest pre-symptomatic transmission common asymptomatic transmission rare.

I also would like see data surrounding transmission. Ideally one vaccine trials would study percentage vaccine-infected volunteers infected household members vs placebo infections. However, number infections vaccine groups small may reach stastical significance. Could referring, specifically, British variant? Thankfully experience much short sharp reaction realitively quickly. I'd always mild side effects, fell well within realm normal (low-grade fever nausea mostly). However first year bad reaction pretty much could stop vomiting hour, basically trying dry heave guts despite giving something supposed help. felt like I'd hit truck days fine. following year thing happened also broke hives main reason doctor seemed think allergic reaction. yeah days fine again. What?? kidding me? risky vaccinated 2 months. (At worst) rest end summer. everyone always negative?..... million? rolled since week  Yup. CureVac hasn’t even enrolled yet meanwhile J&amp;J efficacy dating coming within week. happened talk Canada buying like four times population

Canada ordered multiple times population, bought. know preorder is? know kickstarter is? go that's vaccine development answers question. 9 million now. vaccine yet? Almost all? Please stop making statements like this. accurate helpful. Exactly. I've never understood (as atheist) people treat medicine going god. god given us intelligence understand creation? Two good indications.

1. Moderna gave second shot vaccine trial roughly 67% lower incident rate infection vaccine group compared placebo. CI fairly large due low numbers, also one dose know immune response even better two doses. infected (or infected low level PCR cannot pick up) likely spreading virus. 

2. Studies household transmission found people symptomatic infection likely spread virus. Given vaccine significantly reduce symptoms reason believe vaccine reduce transmission. 

At point, good chance reduce transmission. harder data coming weeks/months. Immunosupressed persons, theorized thing caused British virus.  last stores sense, shop allow anyone without mask. anti mask brigade mask get someone else buy food cheep cider without, protect shop workers r/theydidthemath many studies need show hydroxychloroquine nothing COVID-19? think important part preventing transmission hospitalization part concern someone transmit to, said, don’t know know sure % protection appearance symptoms nobody knows % infected symptoms first place, could little 10% anything shows up. blind pessimism ugly trait Oxford also doesn’t require extreme temperatures. near patel brothers store, find looking for. obscure Indian spices ingredients stocked. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically.

Trying... To... Justify.... bothers much per 10,000 instead per 100,000 like charts though  seen research data this, John Hopkins University FAQ said ok long swabbed positive PCR. Take care wish speedy recovery. really wish could push messaging. dont need herd immunity. severely affected populations covered - specifically older population - death rate strain hospitals would decrease dramatically. happens risk/benefit maintaining lockdowns drops sharply.

Doesn't mean back normal, masks &amp; distancing (where possible) remaining, idea stay-at-home orders, keeping schools closed, etc becomes harmful end spectrum primary groups covered. Coming Irish guy normally loves EU, makes blood boil stupidly fucking slow vaccine rollout going. probably even require masks social distancing March comes around.

What people cannot vaccinated medical reasons? Adults wear masks too. vaccine prevent spreading virus. Star Wars? 78% effective according Brazil trial, largest trial would go that. (They found 65% Indonesia 91% Turkey, trials small hundred volunteers arm, would trust numbers Brazil's.)

100% effective far preventing severe cases hospitalizations, important part. details data expected today.

My license plates end 6969. 🤪😆🤪 existing administration make COVID job #1. interested politics. prioritized Coronavirus response, *over considerations*, would much better place. friend CA works drug rehab center got vaccinated two weeks ago. gave state # employees facility, emailed XX sign links, person enrolled went hospital get vaccinated. fair enough, point still stands though.  lol, former Sec. State, Brian Kemp, things Trump claimed done him. record now. ok. understand you’re speaking certainties vaccines without doubt protect infection well. thing can’t quantify can’t comment it. He's right. Get elderly vaccinated let people go back lives. Almost deaths 65+ group. Well comes Spiegel article disputes BILD says.

My guess, BILD made ""British Virus"", German Sun all.


""Mehrere Quellen widersprachen einem Bericht der »Bild«, wonach die Bundeskanzlerin der Sitzung weitere acht bis zehn Wochen harte Corona-Maßnahmen angekündigt habe""

deepl:

""Several sources contradicted report Bild Chancellor announced another eight 10 weeks tough Corona measures meeting"" past weeks percentage positive tests came B1.1.7 increased massively Ireland:

Week 52/2020: 9%
Week 53/2020: 25%
Week 1/2021: 45%

So give maybe two weeks basically relevant strain Ireland.

Source: (I look direct source Ireland, risklayer great job observing pandemic Germany also added focus UK/Ireland past weeks)  No, translation. might Bild newspaper. never heard Bild, Wikipedia compares Sun. vaccination rate Germany going extremely slow pace, part due fact enough vaccines (which ironically made german company). even ones available distributed slow full chaos. already reports several shipments completely ruined due improper care. I’m sure upset, rather making comment article CANADA deciding vaccination purchases, yet come commenting politics different country...you literally added zero value entire discussion.

Ps situation read roommates earlier life did. Newspaper obituaries longer usually are.

I definitely think hoax. want people recognize damage done, stop blaming im general, start admitting need change course one way another. knows? deaths rising Euro countries: UK 1243(6,065 US equivalent)---Portugal 155(5,053)---Germany 1080(4,276)---Hungary 128(4390)---Italy 616(3388)---Ireland 45(3006)---Netherlands 152(2948)---Spain 408(2856) London went tier 2 start December absoutlely catastrophic mistake. Pubs shops open woukd fueled Today's reported deaths happened 3-5 weeks ago.

This true. today’s reported deaths happened several weeks ago many recently. Look top two graphs show deaths based death date (days weeks). red ones ones added today. Palácios, medical director clinical research Butantan, said lower efficacy rate caused inclusion patients infected novel coronavirus displayed “very light” symptoms.  3 trial data US-based **Pfizer-BioNTech** Covid-19 vaccine, example, gives 95 per cent efficacy rate. However, 44,000 volunteers **there 3,410 participants displayed Covid-19 symptoms tested, according US Food Drug Administration report**. unlikely event participants tested positive, total efficacy rate would drop 30 per cent.  vaccine manufacturers include light headaches even testing positive Covid-19,” said Palácios. “The important number 50.”  added inclusion light cases represented “stringent test”, complicating comparisons Covid-19 vaccines.

This really concerning. know read part. quick search found below. covid-19”**

All attention focused dramatic efficacy results: Pfizer reported 170 PCR confirmed covid-19 cases, split 8 162 vaccine placebo groups. numbers dwarfed category disease called “suspected covid-19”—those symptomatic covid-19 PCR confirmed. According [FDA’s report Pfizer’s “3410 total cases suspected, unconfirmed covid-19 overall study population, 1594 occurred vaccine group vs. 1816 placebo group.”

With 20 times suspected confirmed cases, category disease cannot ignored simply positive PCR test result. Indeed makes urgent understand. rough estimate vaccine efficacy developing covid-19 symptoms, without positive PCR test result, would relative risk reduction 19% (see footnote)—far 50% effectiveness threshold authorization set [by](http://www.icmra.info/drupal/en/news/22june2020/summary) Even removing cases occurring within 7 days vaccination (409 Pfizer’s vaccine vs. 287 placebo), include majority symptoms due short-term vaccine reactogenicity, vaccine efficacy remains low: 29% (see footnote).

 

**The 371 individuals excluded Pfizer vaccine efficacy analysis**

Another reason need data analyse unexplained detail found table [FDA’s Pfizer’s vaccine: 371 individuals excluded efficacy analysis “important protocol deviations prior 7 days Dose 2.”  concerning imbalance randomized groups number excluded individuals: 311 vaccine group vs 60 placebo. (In contrast, [Moderna’s 36 participants excluded efficacy analysis “major protocol deviation”—12 vaccine group vs 24 placebo group.)

What protocol deviations Pfizer’s study, five times participants excluded vaccine group?  [FDA doesn’t say, exclusions difficult even spot [Pfizer’s [journal Channel 13 News said according figures released Clalit, Israel’s largest health provider, chance person infected coronavirus dropped 33% 14 days vaccinated. Separate figures recorded Maccabi health provider aired Channel 12 showed vaccine caused 60% drop chances infection 14 days taking first HMOs compiled data 400,000 patients treated (800,000 cause discrepancy studies immediately clear.

Will interesting see resolved, (hopefully published paper/preprint) numbers studies Israel would expect discreptancy. sure want. reason tried brazil china see really works. another fact ""first"" brings one going make money. would trust vaccine much would've start country safe people economy. point everyone little Trump really know works knew work good money right? Simply put: it’s effective 80%+ it’s really beginning end end comes way quicker think today. true doom scrollers New York Times claim otherwise. awhile vaccine gets evidence put mandate levels. Healthcare workers still option decline vaccination given circumstances new couple year follow incomplete. non-Chinese source? think vaccines mind. 

""Warum bekomme ich die Impfung nicht bei meinem Hausarzt?""

""Es wird zunächst nicht genügend Impfstoff für die gesamte Bevölkerung zur Verfügung stehen. Außerdem müssen manche Impfstoffe im Ultra-Tiefkühl-Temperaturbereich (-75°C) gelagert werden. Darüber hinaus werden initial Impfstoffe nur Mehrdosenbehältnissen verfügbar sein. der ersten Phase werden die Impfungen daher speziell eingerichteten Impfzentren erfolgen, eine zeitnahe Impfung von vielen Menschen und gleichzeitig auch eine bessere Überwachung der neuartigen Impfstoffe ermöglicht.

Zudem sind mobile Teams geplant, die weniger mobile Menschen etwa Altenheimen aufsuchen. der zweiten Phase sollen die Impfungen zu einem großen Teil Arztpraxen durchgeführt werden. Voraussetzung ist, dass ausreichend Impfstoffe für ein Impfangebot breitere Bevölkerungsgruppen zur Verfügung stehen wird und dass ein großer Teil der Impfstoffe unter Standardbedingungen gelagert werden kann.""

deepl:

""Why can't get vaccine primary care physician?""

""Initially, enough vaccine available entire population. addition, vaccines need stored ultra-low temperatures (-75°C). addition, initial vaccines available multi-dose containers. Therefore, initial phase, vaccinations take place specially established vaccination centers, allow timely vaccination large numbers people and, time, better surveillance novel vaccines.

In addition, mobile teams planned visit less mobile people, example nursing homes. second phase, vaccinations carried large extent doctors' offices. prerequisite sufficient vaccines available offer vaccination broader populations large proportion vaccines stored standard conditions."" Colorado state government putting state workers ahead vulnerable population? Many deaths hands. removed office. You’re totally right, definitely suffer US-centric tunnel vision comes vaccination progress makes complete sense. I'm sure real Al-Qaeda much better weapons willingness actually takes get want.

and many new business created. get ride Matterhorn bobsleds afterwards? Yes, live this. Except people ignoring it. Freeways got plenty traffic people puts risk vaccinated

There likely still people waiting list want it, time. at-risk people *can't* get taking appropriate precautions

Which reduce, eliminate, risk. they're effective are, people taking them. soon everyone else goes back normal, jacks risk still vulnerable, whether taking precautions themselves.

Personal responsibility never enough protect virus. tend think like umbrella, keeping rain us, not. like bedsheet covers us people around us. One bedsheet, rain still gets through. Everyone puts bedsheets, overlap, maybe little bit gets refuse right thing. 

That's false assumption, reasons mentioned above. refuse right thing, sure. screw them, also screw others deserve it.

Maybe. I'm holding hope protects transmission well. not, article over-cautious least. yeah, option.   

But collect data time anf get follow antibody tests them.   

Both see actually safe go know wether give doses someone else vaccination work right idea. two stick method real logistical challenge. hear that. Must stressful HELL. Sorry hear it. face similar Im forced go every weekend public medical reasons, stress fear real me. Except treat everyone comes vaccines. lock EVERYBODY regardless age, give priority old people.

Best Buy even open except appointment am. We’re superstitious, that’s bad luck  much difference people 60 comes dangerosity. vaccinate 60+ immuno-compromised people target people interact many persons like tellers taxi drivers. could argue *after old people vaccinated* younger people free. course would still start youngest, kids going back school first (after teachers vaccinated!).  about? one suggesting using medicine incorrectly. China? Lie? Come on. could seen coming? Tell allergies. Get vaccine. are: someone says things right must negative rated ;) Ah yes. course. Treating everybody exactly way somehow discrimination. could hedging bets, maybe inkling maybe one dose enough younger patients older. Hopefully imminent unblinded readout clears one way another. bet would get thousands vaccinate, give free park tickets (good parks open) Fair enough: immunocompromised people *can* skip line, also get all, depending feel risk. Well, you’ve got remember there’s countries, too. Namely Countries European Union ordered 300 million doses. US got lions share modernas Pfizers first shipment, time rest world get aswell. Oh look Disneyland going get subsidized tax payers ""renting"" property government. generous them. PPP loans bail outs reason this. tricked think kindness heart. literally paying (tax payers) happen. would say might paying things work. sure hope someone NC department health reads article... hovering 25% administered ages frustrating. Ahhhhhh sheesh... stupid bots. let's give another 2 weeks deaths catch up. End Jan going see record numbers deaths. 

Tho point day near future going see record deaths. Reading twice probably it: 1/29 + 1/29 = 2/29

(I know, know, that's US version) reason evidence suggest current vaccines provide immunity variants. Yes it’s bit gamble assume production enough supply 2nd doses think right path take. get everyone 65+, frontline workers otherwise vulnerable fully vaccinated doses, hospitalizations deaths cut significantly. Everyone else wait first dose first category gotten doses least doses distributed. I’m 2nd category don’t mind waiting long takes. risk serious illness death small continue stay home wait least vulnerable protected. hope realize they’re joking, don’t actually use bleach it’s dangerous wonder early serious disease protection kicks in. Sad see ex-congresswoman catch covid. work vulnerable least vulnerable. 75 comorbidities, Category 1, etc. Well could be. However I’m optimistic reduce transmission point little virus go around thus little chance mutate significantly. Vaccine manufacturers believe need adjusted vaccine every couple years shouldn’t problem.
Another scenario imagine virus mutates partly evade antibody response yearly jab indeed necessary high risk groups cross immunity general population reduce risk levels mild flu. speculation though Got it. agree, see saying appreciate detailed response!

Well hey, I'd love case. one starts rolling out, effective, pandemic end. Iirc politicians say enough vaccines available start expected slow Last number stumbled upon month two ago. 23-24% seropositive studies. Millions getting vaccinated. It’s getting worse gets better, hang there. highly doubtful would need modify vaccine new variants, get vaccine ASAP.

You trolling now. gave links quote. 

Let ask one time move on: understand spent hours House floor, Republicans refused wear masks, wearing normal mask?

Meanwhile, given evidence support original assertion took mask off, switching gas mask. 

Do understand this? not, understand this? I've literally given links, video, quotes proving it. unable back even proven wrong? Demand outstrips supply. That's what's hard. Hopefully we’ll get data soon, population studies antibody test taken peoples sake.

I could reaaaaly use vaccine right Lol ""minor."" huge difference. That's distinction summarises care others. made Americans, that's beauty it! find best people world offer, give coffee, small chevy truck, one little flags BOOM! One American genius brag about. never thought I’d see day sub would beacon rational logical opinions. used doom gloom central. gravitated towards anti-lockdown subs felt zero risk culture grew covid mitigation strategies bit unnecessary top, tend go far direction me. They’re very, anti mask also anti vax. It’s one thing restrictions regulations, entirely different thing together claim masks don’t work vaccine isn’t safe. That’s anti science drag whole thing further. They’re actively working one silver bullet get us crap. 

I’ve pleasantly surprised see people generally upvoting comments suggest couple months vaccinate elderly high risk returning normalcy anyone claiming take longer continue restrictions beyond herd immunity getting downvoted.

Lockdown fatigue setting in, people ready put whole thing behind us. elderly high risk vaccinated death hospitalization rates plummet least flu levels. absolutely reason continue restrictions beyond point. It’s refreshing see opinion becoming mainstream sub! I’m honestly sure still conversation good faith, I’m going break manor hopefully leaves zero doubt.

1.) Riot/Insurrection begins.
2.) Lawmakers house floor (wearing cloth masks).
3.) USCP/USSS locks floor.
4.) point either relation gas threat likely anticipation tear gas deployment, lawmakers directed gas masks. masks stored desks, house floor. least one picture maskless floor (she’s donning gas mask).
5.) Lawmakers moved smaller, secure location aka “the room” you’ve referring (this location claims got COVID complains anti-maskers).

Somewhere steps 4 5 either went back cloth mask military grade gas masks worthless. read article follow timeline within it. late December hospitals started receive cases. Give vulnerable vaccine first. What's hard that? That’s really it’s looking like me. I’ve googling morning can’t figure out.  public health officials recommend states expand access Covid-19 vaccines everyone ages 65 up, Centers Disease Control Prevention said Tuesday. new guidelines, set announced Operation Warp Speed briefing Tuesday afternoon, also expected include adults age underlying health condition would put risk complications severe illness. Andy Beshear, CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield wrote recommendations ""should interpreted regulation,"" adding guidance ""is meant flexible adaptable."" Furlough. rich, yes paying workers - should. I'm Irish drop ball December. 

It's unfortunate fall one lowest Covid rates Europe one highest space month. 

First wave March hit us badly first lockdown got control May. summer would days zero deaths rarely 3 deaths one day. 

Going Winter, government decided lockdown month November allow us relaxed lead Christmas, around 100 cases day. work well, 269 cases December 1st, government promised lockdown November, relaxed restrictions December really go back it. 

That coupled UK variant led massive increase. Everyone shopping lead Christmas attending parties. January 4th we'd got 6110 cases day.

We back lockdown least Jan/Feb. try travel 5km (3.1 miles) home, come across police checkpoints.

I'd imagine really get thing vaccines start kicking in. States set priority groups. CDC provided recommendation, hardly handcuffs. Many states choose alternative prioritization. Could be. mean, wouldn’t first breech trust medical industry, regulators, general public. still reeling opioid epidemic cost far loss life Covid. entirely manufactured industry enabled regulators.

Plus whole profit motive, endless conflicts interest like head OWS finding loophole keep stocks vaccine companies.

Not sure industry regulators really done garner trust. don’t use medicine, consider things genuine red flags saying need use judgement. red enchiladas? do, written recipe could definitely tell make them. ""made order"" skillet wok, tbe oven though. Came say this. Another representative announced positive test right vote certify Biden, seen without mask spoke objection.

Health Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said ""the administration states narrowly focused.""


As result, said, Trump administration asking states vaccinate people age 65 65 underlying health conditions put high risk. said vaccine production second dose two-shot vaccine released without jeopardizing immunization got first shot.

""We believe manufacturing predictable enough ensure second doses available people ongoing production, Azar told ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""So everything available states health care providers.""

Azar said time move ""to next phase vaccine program"" expand pool eligible get first dose.

That also means expanding number places people vaccinated adding community health centers additional drug stores.

""We've already distributed vaccine health care workers people nursing homes,"" Azar said. ""We've got get channels administration. We've got get pharmacies, get community health centers.""

He said federal government ""will deploy teams support states mass vaccination efforts wish so.""

President-elect Joe Biden expected give speech Thursday outlining plan speed vaccines people first part administration. transition team vowed release many vaccine doses possible, rather continuing Trump administration policy holding back millions doses ensure would enough supply allow getting first shot get second one.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine requires second shot three weeks first vaccination. Another vaccine, one produced Moderna, requires second shot four weeks afterward.

Fisman et one compares efficacy surgical masks source control seasonal coronaviruses (NL63, OC43, 229E, HKU1), influenza, rhinovirus. 10 participants, masks effective blocking coronavirus particles sizes every subject. However, masks far less effective blocking rhinovirus particles size, blocking small influenza particles. results suggest masks may significant role source control current coronavirus outbreak. study use COVID-19 patients, yet known whether SARS-CoV-2 behaves seasonal coronaviruses, review literature offers evidence favor widespread mask use source control reduce community transmission: Nonmedical masks use materials obstruct particles necessary size; people infectious initial period postinfection, common symptoms nonmedical masks effective reducing transmission respiratory viruses; places time periods mask usage required widespread shown substantially lower community transmission. 

Can maybe quote section(s) linked article says measures counterproductive? think anything study linked showed there’s low risk reinfection. 
 
“However, 2,800 person study found symptomatic re-infections ~118 day window (78), 1,246 person study observed symptomatic re-infections 6 months (79). observed heterogeneity magnitude adaptive immune responses SARS-CoV-2 persisting immune memory phase. therefore possible fraction SARS-CoV-2-infected population low immune memory would become susceptible re-infection relatively soon. gender disease severity contribute heterogeneity immune memory reported here, source much heterogeneity immune memory SARS-CoV-2 unknown worth examination.

Masks work, dont want get sick, wear one choose vaccinate allowing people sanctity free will.

Theres always room choice. Isn’t 30 years old? Compare mRNA feels ancient modern medicine.

Edit might vector vaccines general. since broke rules house sued possibly face criminal charges asked protect others! people entitled fucking babies. please elaborate instead posting sarcastic remarks... hesitant, received dose one Moderna yesterday.

While side effects documented almost always mild, know like read anecdotal evidence experience.

My side effects first 24 hours slightly sore arm mild headache disappeared two regular-strength ibuprofen. Frankly, tend experience worse flu shot even able sleep arm received vaccine.

Among know received Moderna Pfizer, worst know moderate diarrhea dose two Pfizer. I'm also skeptical related vaccine individual makes food choices poorly-raised toddler. Preprint says « Second part epidemic started july (and caused variant named ""genotype 4"" online paper started mink breeding Denmark. » four-day period. last report Friday.

Good luck :( really idea politics work That’s fabulous. hope it’s accurate. california shut retail?

When worsen never really got drastically better begin Better safe sorry, I'd wear mask keep distances. vaccine kill contract COVID-19 someone else vaccine work?

Edit: possibly vaccine. Still investigation. would assume multiple doses required reach desired efficacy. that's case probably undesirable half dose people, particularly simply leaves actual benefit. 
Better fully immunize people methodically half arse it. would argue leak. official source. Imagine believing sure. Super common viruses spread pretty untrackably real reason speculate. covid test won’t help much since say positive even past covid

It’s best panic similar assume got huge hint grocery. assume it’s normal cold kind thing. it’s worth going hospital worry point   We'll soon flooded vaccines Europe, around April, speed vaccinations still sufficient. 10x higher countries, maybe 30x higher. People complain low Pfizer Moderna doses one country used up. :/ fucking leak, government report. I'm sure OP would prefer swab nose.

When symptoms get better around 10 days, quarantine lifted.

People experience different symptoms last different time, exact ""science"". Quarantine duration higher safe, trade keep economy running too. makes sense. happens last day April?

Ain’t American Dream grand?! 50% country. 30% refuse vaccine Alaska remote areas, see transport challenging. I'm introverted homebody middling-to-mediocre mental health. Bit hermit already normal times. fucking destroyed even me. crumbling. Flu cases confirmed positive lab result. So... no. Honestly May already long. told last June we'd still seeing restrictions 2021, believed it. Forget food rent want KILL GRANDMA???? Israel achieve March. already posted sub. referring entire world, brainer consider many countries left cold richest countries bought vaccines advance. However, read discussion [-1] I'm still unclear 3x rate make Using Approach 4 data CDC, ND positivity rate 6.94% (let's say 7%). applied 3x rate entire pandemic, would 21% (I'm aware little higher rate definitely 3x early on).

This faulty logic, though. Positivity rate measure many tests positive. measure percent population positive. can't say, ""Oh, we're going apply 3x factor positivity rate"" positivity rate function actual tests performed people. way get higher positivity rate people actually infected. 1.4M tests done ND (including antigen tests presume), would give 294k infected individual.

You're literally saying 3x people actually tested COVID, COVID. make bit sense. people tested. tested negative. can't say, ""Oh, we're going model data fit hypothesis 3x people infected even though people question actually tested tested negative."" see problem this? actually science. starting conclusion trying make numbers fit conclusion rather going actual positivity rate people actually see take peak % apply entire wave higher % could mean better detection rate (lower 3x). 

Because generous numbers used order give everybody benefit doubt. Using highest possible positivity rate gives LOWEST total population. positivity rate lower, total population size needed get positivity rate INCREASES. instance, positivity rate 6% applied across entire period, North Dakota would need population 4.1 million. believe argumentation relies number individuals would need tested produce numbers.

Nope. argument rests total number people would need live North Dakota order get many positive cases high positivity rate. number exceeds population state, math simply work out. large share infected reported positive 1 2 tests only, remainder (those apparently dodging virus) get tested average 5 6 times instead 4.

Which I'm using unique test numbers... Unique individuals. I'm using cumulative number tests. eliminates bias that. approach also consider tests done. Hypothetically, number tests constant - say - May December,

Which used numbers large wave September late December... that's already accounted for. reason state tested 25% population rather 50% population (which total unique tests throughout entire pandemic vs 25% large case, I'm arguing ND reached herd immunity all, seems ~25% population infected little low considering ND excess deaths officially attributed COVID-19

The excess deaths listed total excess deaths include COVID deaths... ""in addition"" COVID death totals. ""Our analysis examines deaths causes — confirmed cases coronavirus — beginning virus took hold."" 1100 excess deaths December 5th. That's right line number COVID deaths according ND COVID dashboard. (click Trends, select cumulative CDC estimates general IFR US 0.6-0.8.

So, let's math. 0.6%-0.8% 1352 deaths. That's 169,000 225,333 infected. 22% 29% population would need infected. Split difference... 25.5% population infected. QED. put IFR higher, though, CDC we've calculating real time. CDC's last update September. Depends country you’re Interested answer well That's stupid. whole process made hate FDA much. already delayed Pfizer Moderna month, drag feet J&amp;J I'm going lose it.

But economy !!  Doh... flu disappeared many got flu vaccine... everyone thought way did, one would got flu vaccine we'd battling flu infections top covid cases, combined effects probably resulting much higher covid mortality rates Yeah, think big events back Memorial Day weekend, “vaccine passports” prove you’ve gotten shot. think vaccine passport phase reopening probably lasts end 2021, they’ll gone COVID levels low several months row.

Doctors probably say events held fall, vaccine passport going provide tolerable middle ground everybody anti-vaxxers. child born virgin. Thank hard work.

If familiar health statistics, numbers may look unimpressive good. essentially quarantining since last March got flu shot anyway. reasoning could medical/dental emergency exposed Covid flu getting care. could also forced evacuate home due wildfires earthquakes exposed viruses sheltering evacuees. 

I know flu shot much less likely help years careful, scenarios totally impossible. also super easy get drive sites available, stamping much flu possible helps strained healthcare system. wear mask Biden theory immune Covid it’s time move White House. expect March-April decrease cases due combination vaccinations better weather. False dichotomy. economy suffers, public health suffers. vice-versa. personal opinion vaccine widely available everyone wants vaccine masks fall wayside. Either got vaccine safe (and likely can't spread it) get vaccine made personal choice to, willing take risk getting virus. Either way think middle summer masks start fall off. thing trialling steroid inhalers recently get much media coverage, probably eclipsed vaccine roll talk new I'm hoping drop like brick within 2 months, 75+ people second dose vaccine couple weeks fully kick in. hard judge lag death reporting time getting sick dying, definitely looking much better then.

Here ""Onion Soup"" ""Once across Garden  correct. European testing however risen significantly probably starting capture accurate data. article states Europe catching America better Europe worse.

This extremely odd conclusion make supporting evidence.

What true European testing risen significantly past months though still American levels. Next time make better joke, kind crap. Shutting industry global pandemic likely occur within livetime hardly precedent tons reports already trickling people getting vaccine contracting COVID prior getting second shot. curious see many people start getting COVID second shot... tbf, cold deli meat honestly fine. look reports listeria-induced pregnancy problems, 99.99% due oysters.

Like single one decade due deli meat, like two potentially due super old sushi wife last looke (7ish years ago?).

Hope pulls through.  work healthcare upstate hospitals major city either diversion almost full. worked 18 hours straight yesterday abysmal conditions I've ever seen. really hope vaccine slows things open safely seem likely. Yeah, that's supposed ""b"". think one correlation things. people severely vitamin deficient would make sense serious cases deficient people.

However, worst case, people take vitamin fewer deficient. Best case, actually helps covid. So, take vitamins. likely hype surrounding it. us probably permanently fucked head now. Bloody covid. Maybe well.

It’s prevent focusing election feel awful lawmakers exposed. said, new variant, think cloth masks eye protection going cut indoors.

You need well fitting surgical, N95, K95 FFP2. Quarantine stupid joke. They’d maybe call ask you’re staying home. could mall wouldn’t make difference. testing whatsoever. Stupid government way. Same. Wouldn’t enthused getting Sinovac one though. official information many doses AstraZeneca could ship EU area approval? I'm hoping good amount doses available immediately, can't find info this. knows healthcare workers include students healthcare? student doctor physical therapy I’m curious know sit terms eligibility. currently rotation April. remember redditors convinced EMA waiting US trial data granting approval. I'm glad case. He’s talking federal taxes homeboy. California highest STATE taxes nation. State income tax, property tax, sales tax, etc. much higher average CA. happens insurance?

No. creating revenue state. charged vaccine. public health crisis. time monetize vaccines tests. wish people fermented food home, least consumed more. way live. said fermenting decade, imagine know doing. I'm arguing that.

That said, want others know good bacteria problem situation. Probiotic foods studied proven reduce microbes, including candida.

It's possible overconsumption diluting lowering amount stomach acid available. would create environment hospitable candida flourish. want people think probiotics blame.

Edit add: course, overconsumption fermented foods cause issues like gastrointestinal distress. Please don't, getting many people state even country coming vaccine. fair residents. CA rocking usual... Meanwhile Austria haven‘t even vaccinated 10k people 🤦🏻‍♂️ thought end march gonna get orders coming cause april supposed start vaccinating everybody else canada right still vaccinating front line workers yeah? may introvert coling mechanisms mental health issues outside closed.

I hope get this. know glad ok

Thank :)

Hope well family safe. Interesting see numbers turn tomorrow next couple weeks numbers weekend Monday usually lower. 

Do guys think already experienced Christmas/New Year’s surge yet haven’t? 400,000 this? Welding done en masse either, last resort people refusing quarantine.

What common sealing certain entry points complexes apartments direct foot traffic. feel like written me. I'm trying keep kids smiling laughing stressful time. Keep busy, set Zoom calls friends relatives, take park weekends feel normalcy. damn stressed. Hair falling out, grey hair. One day time. connection pass extra vaccine way, please let know! took statistics biochemistry. know we’re unaware variants America? There’s 22 mutations South African strain alone.

We lot monitor mutations, variants know expected immune love guys hope you’re ok. Nurses make next nothing. incentive love.

I really appreciate do! Thank you, send love hope you’re well. vaccine declined unfortunately developed Covid taking care patients. screened weekly even though be. I’m ok though fortunately. know people going tough times right now. definitely am. grandpa lived Great Depression. ate lard sandwiches. got drafted sniper WW2 maybe I’m lucky? don’t feel lucky feel sick

Again, thank rest us. Nurses really getting hazard pay, raises  know situation making excuses true despite knowing details... also known virus take 14 days show symptoms. saying poor Person exposed infected person (Day Person developed symptoms (Day People exposed Person (Day 4) \[ALL 9 people exposed Person day, Person announced symptoms (Day Everyone quarantined (Day Person tested positive, contact traced infector (Day First people Person started developing symptoms (Day Last person test positive COVID (who tested negative 5th day exposure (Day 9)) develops symptoms tests positive next day (Day 15). person CONTACT ANYONE initial exposure date (Day 4)

Every single person absolutely quarantined.

Saying I'm 'dangerous' warning people quarantine full extent requested government's public health orders, one family member mine may outlier, within well understood timeframe develop symptoms?

What stupid thing say.

You're calling misinformed dangerous dangerously spreading unsubstantiated misinformation yourself.  Exactly! create sustainable way life provides all?  Figured much. didn’t know national guard distributing vaccine states? I’d imagine support significant enough would cause problems already slow vaccine distribution us literally defend domestic terrorists. pointless fear mongering headline I’ve ever seen one! made laugh loud Ok Netanyeahu Harambe tried warn us. would prove got from. impossible know eyes law. It’s exactly like giving someone aids without telling youre infected, crime. I'm Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine trial, yay! hope working. might got vaccine might got placebo (it's double-blind trial) far good. Covid yet! local communities medical facility residents could conveniently see nurse get shot... Herd immunity different. matter, people call ""DF"" (""de efe"") ""Distrito Federal"" countries? Australia New Zealand? subreddit kept telling Asian countries got together, wear masks culture superior Western cultures value collective rather individual. yet, Japan state emergency now. ****Record scratch**** Well, got mess gorilla died. learned anything movies, need save another gorilla's life end curse go back normal. People obsessed getting stimulus checks caring industries actually affected covid.  agree mandates EUA vaccines.

Still, pace, wonder vaccine get standard approval widely available (in US) children get EUA. also classify bioterrorism since viruses involved Even 12.5% positivity indicates insufficient testing, *most* cases likely going undetected. Yep. Things moving right direction. going end using word exponential growth good manner pretty soon. saying? Let's ignore COVID long term effects. America! fully capable dealing this. think need worry. Trump admin going stop holding back 2nd doses supposedly. think good decision states better ready get doses arms appear there's going additional federal assistance actually administering doses. live NY grandmother, mother, great aunt uncle set get vaccinated early feb. 

Things finally looking Thanks. read article: ""O'Toole said Trudeau government turned attention pre-ordering tens millions vaccine doses companies Pfizer Moderna August collaboration National Research Council Chinese vaccine maker CanSino collapsed following months delays. 'I would put eggs basket China,' O'Toole said.""

The deal Chinese vaccines inked May, obviously never course partner Canada would say they're working fast get vaccines ready. PR. Aight Nice, progress right direction. Still, go faster.  Wait need immunocompromised individual churn mutation different spike protein bypasses antibody detection still replicate mutates fast magic silver bullet? Yes unclear requiring N95 masks hard find. wasn’t comparing two. Requiring masks good cheap readily available. minimum? UK's population growing, still continues grow

I understand comment state pensions unfortunately fent laced :( already live events tours planned anticipation things opening up. helping? helping people get covid even though come contact covid +be person? Actually EMA review manufacturing give conditional marketing approval think that's makes take much time Right...??  think maybe need another 10 studies confirm work really hope j&amp;j reads quite effective. Hopefully end month. plan distribute 1 billion doses year, so. single dose stored normal refrigerator (which great news many parts world). top Oxford/Astrazeneca may approved Feb. Theoretically could 4 vaccines US Feb, maybe novovax March. Available doses skyrocket true. Try 12+ years. Meanwhile, think anyone Australia vaccinated yet. Neither Biden Trump anything increased speed we’re seeing now. inaccurate taken down. US started *yesterday* 6.7M vaccines administered currently 9.2M without even factoring today's additions. I’ll tell ya....it hurtful. ever going proceed day thoroughly owned. I’ll thinking it. day. said family member developed covid 11 days contact.

Did exactly one contact exactly one person 11 days ago certain possible way could contracted it, besides 100% isolation contact people potentially infected surfaces?

Or going daily business interacting dozens hundreds people, one may it, touch door handle credit card machine virus, contracted someone something without knowing it?

The second scenario likely people get it. people simply assume contact trace themselves. Denmark teaching others things done. table comparing N95 (US Standard) FFP2 (EUStandard) KN95 (Chinese find minor differences ignoring long term illnesses resulted COVID? enough data? think there's gonna pressure time aroun No

fucking

shit.

Seriously? America doesn’t badly, either. STOP, They're gonna make strong That's exceedingly rare. stay locked house never go anywhere possibly infect anyone. like saying ""my body choice"" lighting cigarette grocery store inside work. hurting possibly killing others along yourself. possible mRNA vaccines 80% one dose too. data tho. Dystopia Yeah recommended immunologists can't certain region covid-19 antibodies made against. know vaccination-mediated antibody production spike protein highly efficacious, want everyone making antibodies. group antibodies portion virus contribute herd immunity even without vaccine. They're dumb  People like would never nerve act like seeing examples bad behavior. see narcissism. actually thinks people join battle call.

A normal person would see video think entitled obnoxious idiot keep quiet. However people like apparently see behavior think great something mimicked.

For may happen last category, picture getting bus schizophrenic starts spouting conspiracy theory top lungs. disturbance everyone's attempt remain chilled traveling. one wants hear it.

(This might bad example since schizophrenic delusions might far interesting anti-mask rhetoric).  alternative example would imagine someone religion believe shouting convert whole bus faith everyone wants get home.  real question get vaccine? far know still available first responders still front line workers still Maryland. Yeah know ground. pointing don’t jus tiny pick Florida. state willingly delay it. BL might also incompetent people involved sides political divide Korean Gov't literally said holding large purchase became good deal price-gouging that's going now, especially since they're manufacturing Moderna AstraZ themselves. Florida third highest population terms states US, makes lot sense. know 10 people got covid age fine. don’t want rushed vaccine. body choice would mean constant testing non-symptomatic non-placebo placebo test subjects. much work something lower priority list. data begin show vaccinate more. find interesting situation live literally anywhere continental US next months (and change location whenever want to). #1 priority find way get vaccine (without anything illegal unethical--I'm dress senior citizen try sneak senior center, example). father many health issues able see close year, get vaccinated would change.

What would best strategy this? I'm 30 years old, good health, good financial means disposal. work healthcare essential worker categories.

Any particular states might willing vaccinate someone younger? States they're laissez-faire vaccines? strategies, reach centers they're vaccinating tell doses close expiring something come short notice? Thank help! like manufacturing companies doses sitting around waiting someone buy them.

The purchased 400M *orders* doses. fulfilled eventually - every order urgent, orders urgent. sure part lockdown fatigue.

But also cases same. Cases today generally far less serious 6 10 months ago. hospitalization fatality rate falling, think primarily 1) cases found testing rather illness, 2) treatments better.

This say everything peachy LA county likely bad original breakout NY.  first dose second dose essentially vaccination? Facetious? vaccinated? Oregon pathetic Vegas holidays, strip pretty shuttered. Off-strip properties normal. story edited Devdiscourse staff auto-generated syndicated feed.)

Is really best source there? Honest Quedtion:

Would surprised told amount 1M still shipped FL? Meh, like Oregon Canada. many people trying hard make statement light peppering white supremacy countryside. Lmaooo racist ""western supremacist"" people sick death deniers caused whole show. Yeah thats addressing latter part comment, still best predictor have. well confusing rule:

for ""click&amp;collect"" (meaning ordering stuff store picking appointment) needed FFP2 mask

but normal grocery shopping ""sth covering mouth nose"" enough

so type shopping contact ppl, less filtering required one less contacts. Guess found error.

&amp;#x200B;

I wondering Baden-Württemberg follows soon. Yeah believe vote tied price Vienna sausages, sure.

Single issue voter right here, fellas, look out. ready walk back comment saying ""a vast majority"" ????

54% barely majority, far less vast one.

And that's US.

Not sure numbers available non-developed countries, promise percentages far lower.

Recently Uganda wanted execute gays (and wanted pass law actually passed it).

Often things pushed religious organizations/nuts developed countries, quite often Americans. can't get murder gays home, go get murdering poorer countries, lot corruption less money.

So please, next time make unfounded claims. state government encouraging it. see people stay month, amount money taxes brings economy dozens times cost shot. love people consider another alternative: better government.

Some things work well.

The mail service used fantastic, instance. Used be. still walk dog past curfew, led kinds weird protests.

People also pimping dogs 30$ hour people walk them. USA richest country world likes claim best country world reasonable higher expectations USA countries. 

Also know details surrounding countries know USA 40M+ doses freezers instead arms completely unacceptable. government unprepared failing miserably. bad Governor camera saying administration assisting believes vaccines better equipped handle administration would fuck up. girlfriend felt really fatigued bit nauseous. arm also sore normal flu vaccine. recovered within day symptom onset, though. people weirdly wallowing seems like almost want over. friend mine keeps saying going go years. think Fauci said one point humans would stop shaking hands forever.

I think complete nonsense. virus likely never eradicated earth true dozens maybe hundreds viruses. vaccine treatment another thing humankind deal go back before. Bro long reach lol  That's actually average. need intubation forced Oxygen, 50/50 case. Sure, that's fine.

Tell others think article pinnacle science publications.

As see replies elsewhere thread, particularly care published it, want jail publishing sensationalized clickbait. Yeah went 8.07M 9.27M. might ""extra"" weekend quite jump. I'm looking 1M per day minimum going forward. sure. hope include every country Israel, Bahrain, UAE, UK categorization well count even embarrassing US. US 5th terms per capita doses administered 1st terms documented raw number doses (though China likely pass front since data updated days). requiring FFP2 European standard. Since Chinese KN95 approved healthcare Europe pandemic, assume good enough shops public transport. That's get keep replacement births minimum. Americans stealing glory usual... That’s true. Nyc strong lock April thru early May. city allowed real essential workers supposed 3 million every single day.........this actually bad. think part problem everyone thinks Trump implying bunch things too... like outright denial virus etc.

But, objectively, right. can't close economy society forever. Even months terrible. year even terrible. Businesses jobs livelihood people gives purpose social outlet. take away everyone time going harm significantly. friend who's nurse felt sick day half. Said also slept almost 14 hours after. Felt totally fine though. That's still ongoing weekends happen municipalities moderate level risk. Modernas vaccine ready almost exactly 1 year ago beginning january 2020. always case.

Among participants, 18,198 received vaccine 18,325 received saline placebo.  **The vaccine 95 percent effective preventing COVID-19 disease among clinical trial participants** 8 COVID-19 cases vaccine group 162 COVID-19 cases placebo group. 170 COVID-19 cases, 1 vaccine group 3 placebo group classified severe. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm planning rushing bar day get vaccine, clinical trials indicate vaccine effective preventing infection, lowering chance severe infection.  True. Hopefully least *increase* significantly. mean, people taking stupid risks going slow down, hopefully least people responsible right going loosen safe so. Seriously, sign up. Lots unemployed people right now. drive around amazon delivery guys. Everyone vaccinated 3 months. Biological terrorism Well think one misunderstood aspects many people infected exposed virus. fair number studies show many times cases. CDC recently estimated 7.2 i.e. 7.2 people infected virus 1 case.

This increases denominator fatality rate significantly. US case fatality rate 1.6% (385k fatalities 23M cases). CDC number correct actually 166M people exposed fatality rate actually 0.2%. asthma, wearing mask kept using inhaler four whole months. need look types masks, one use N95, super comfortable. Jeez... early april. natural immunity last 8 months. Yep won’t, don’t know here. I'm sorry believe you. I'm sorry hear that. hope vaccine ramp quicker expected.

I'm based UK already mates sort lose announced lockdown 15 Feb. I've got family Munich area well Berlin. texting one Berliners morning (she 14-month old) said lockdown March ""will break me."" Maybe. long term effects disease, cases absolutely matter. death rate hospitalizations absolutely matter right (and near term). We're going insanely slow we've trying vaccinate people according race, gender, creed, social status, etc. Instead literally vaccinating anybody everybody needs vaccine.  


Even people older 65 able get vaccinated fit criteria, lived area people deemed important one reason another. changing today. someone lives California would like say behalf us. fuck plan? put piece tape dude went movie St Helens, October that's true stupid question: american companies demanding passengers get tested every flight? forgeting one thing. Moderna US company majority production goes there. EU pfizer atm, provided amount Moderna vaccine really low. still haven’t gotten one I’m damn firefighter exposed shit everyday :/ dont use BILD source. cheap tabloid spreads misinformation time! Again? Reading Floridan confusing lol PA ask vaccines PA ask vaccines  Boat renamed accordingly.  take vaccine, dude. swear, amount people asking take vaccine option early on, faster rest population, truly would make anyone's blood boil. Just. Do. It. Yep, course people shitting here, happening 8 days everyone would praising it. also less people vaccinate immediately since chance re-infection astronomically low sure ""you people"" exactly, yes.

A lot studies putting INFECTION (not case) fatality rate 0.25-0.60%. high 3-5% started.

Also 80% fatalities people 65+ health conditions. 40% nursing homes.

So one groups, fatality rate 80% lower. average fatality rate 0.5%, healthy 65, 0.1%.

For healthy 50 even lower, closer 0.01%. kids fatality rate low effectively zero. 100 fatalities age 0-14.

A lot people realize this. exponentially worse older people. vast, vast majority people little risk, kind risk getting hit car cancer. also bactrim. I’ve met number people mild reactions sulfa, never one also hit zero platelets. 3-4 days started stomach cramping. petechiae showed day 4 doctor told stop bactrim. lucky good doc wary stuff.

My friends COVID also fine, illnesses much worse sore arm people got vaccine.

I've wondering possible extrapolate covid numbers would look like without social distancing comparing flu numbers without.

I'm guessing theory, like 50% less flu cases, maybe ""no lockdown"" covid would 2x cases? likely easy this, might actually exponential since covid spreads way faster, maybe someone better understanding virus help here?

If numbers theories accurate, would mean social distancing produced 97.7% decline flu cases. covid social disctancing would 43 times more?

It sounds way crazy. effective get 1 dose 2 people get 2 doses 1 person? 2 doses 95% effective 1 dose 60% effective, 1 dose 2 people 120% total protection, right? well thread posted today doom gloom: ""Here's **studies yet show**. **They looked whether** vaccine prevents someone carrying COVID-19 spreading others. possible someone could get vaccine could still asymptomatic carrier.""

Congratulations guess? cool story, bro really, especially mild case. Seems bit cleared Capitol's attending physician, Brian Monahan, Capitol quarantined two weeks. always number one reason worldwide China like lockdown started. It’s light years ahead current approved vaccines, easier mass produce cheap.

I agree latter part, would light years ahead lower protection comes months later? can't imagine something secure could developed number weeks (we're 20 weeks away Memorial Day weekend). paper, forged. Apps websites hacked faked.

Many people died last Spring secondary infections played key roles overwhelming body. well known reason dismiss seriousness Covid opens door grim reaper. 

With weaker flu season year thanks global travel restrictions, praying IFR maintains sub-0.5% level “only” lose 600-700k Americans 2020-2021 wave 1 era. ICUs capacity, normal levels. Shutdowns protect overrunning health systems. happened. time open SAME. I’m like, you’re basically digging grave here. want restrictions end aren’t willing allow ANYTHING helps lower numbers all. IMO there’s difference government mandated restrictions (which liber-tary-an [intentionally misspelled doesn’t get removed] leaning individual sympathetic to) completely denying science behind masks help claiming nothing (or I’ve even seen people claim actually harmful). anti vax movement amongst skeptics next level though.  thought already plan. least Florida, HCWs, Nursing Home people, next group 65+. little difficult, 4.5 million age group huge demand. first week servers crashed etc. county, counties seniors sleeping sidewalk overnight lines.

Well, agree advocating trying win people try strategy stretch. also advocate spokesperson something supporting cause.

Either way, try something along lines herd immunity first. That's firm belief (which basically objective truth point email 'leaks').  life short

Life even shorter people infecting, selfish asshole. 

Also know from, ICUs capacity ton places, even so, that's excuse ignorantly spread disease. absolutely time open up, fucking peak right now, highest number infections deaths per day we've ever had, living rock?? ridiculous many people can't make minor changes routine/habits benefit everyone.

I think restricting access public space (sidewalks, parks, etc.) shown relation reducing COVID rates. cases come restaurants, gatherings, in-door activities. Applying heavy-handed curfew, especially one really help, causes people rebel unnecessarily. I'm talking hospitalizations, cases. Cases continue rise (in aggregate across US). 

NYC spread *as* rapidly consistently strictest (and enforced) lockdown measures. Note New York State holistically seeing high growth, well much NYC. 

This say yes, impact. midwestern states likely 40%+ infection rates point meaning seeing Rt falling. Keep mind though, absolute case volume remains high. positivity-adjusted basis, even though South Dakota's cases fallen 70% peak, *still* higher per capita new case loads states spiking like New York barely lower California's new per capita case load.

She knowingly putting people risk, calling Tyranny. great news, 63% 71% total nearly double (32% 62%) among black Americans! Black adults say probably definitely won’t get vaccinated cite major reasons... worried may get COVID-19 vaccine (50%)

I feel like fixable right messaging. Early pandemic proven fine wear 20 times straps usually break anyways.

Most virus particles become inactivated upon touching electrostatically charged fibers. It’s like they’re high contamination environments mask covered it.

Overall better everyone. used doses Hungary, got another 2x52k vaccines today (Moderna Pfizer) neighbours large initial spread take much holidays abroad specific time period Sweden (because different timing school holidays, preference go mountain ranges, swedish people like travel abroad more) much larger impact initial development close cultures are.

You also look autumn development see neighbours spread start earlier Sweden. mean anything cultures? maybe meant traveling Europe summer Sweden still advising travel abroad, thus brought home larger amounts? rampant levels disagreement virus produced poor leadership. deliberately heightened them, cost public health, economy, more.

Just war effort US manufactured unity pretty significant opposition war, leadership nation-state manufacture consent run well skilled politically. say that's purpose, is. There's point nationstate otherwise, illusion shared identity held force nationbuilding exercises.

Instead, leadership politicized things short term political gain. horrible, failed miscalculation neither benefited administration, country. 

Now people contrast total abdication leadership, actual sabotage proper response, totalitarianism. false dichotomy. US actually shutdown enough way effective. enough eff economy allow covid still spread unchecked. Cause god forbid karen let someone pickout produce pop trunk let someone load in.

Easier manage, larger impact. Jeff Bezos center Performing Arts. 
/s bet privately okay publicly liability reasons cannot state otherwise really understand one-dose thing. get principle getting many people single dose possible, draw line? vaccinate whole province 8.5 million first, start 2nd doses? Probably not... point completely pause giving first doses, order catch huge backlog 2nd doses? Where's cut-off? 

The risk-reward seem worth either. Best case scenario, get wider pool people partial immunity faster, needing stop program catch backlog. Worst case scenario, screw vaccine efficacy everyone first phase vaccine delivery, i.e. health care workers vulnerable seniors. 

Just stick schedule borne data! Excuse me, I’m hearing logic I’m gonna need lot conspiracy you. Agreed vaccinating everyone 65 hugely beneficial massive impact reducing death toll. hope timeline accurate. Warp Speed baby Exactly, can’t risk possibility transmission, therefore anyone gets vaccine must still follow protocols. I’m saying that, it’s according CDC.  Definitely weird then.

However, seems sensational. official statement Pfizer essentially boils to; said anything like really follow recommendations.  kinda hunch, accent gives away. appears questions pre-written responds long form them. He's busy guy, also guy said never going back normal?

Never heard say that, though said without vaccine, there's much hope things returning normal anytime soon. French-Canadian = French populations including Quebecois, Metis, Acadians, Franco-Ontarien, immigrant populations.

I’m mostly camp, also think number infections really low (ala COVID19-projections.com estimates &lt; 0.1% people infectious county), it’s pretty likely I’d send kids back school even without vaccines. Hopefully that’s summer weather, infection acquired immunity, vaccinations adults give us - infections almost zero. COVID back early July. tested positive antibodies twice, last month, days ago. plan get rechecked every two months, get vaccine either: everyone else needs received it, longer antibodies phase able receive arrived. Even Moderna released data showing could hinder transmission. Regardless, think precedent vaccines reducing transmission play huge part thinking hey, there’s reason vaccine acts differently. 

Another user made really in-depth post discussing truly asymptomatic people don’t shed virus even close much someone symptoms result vaccines wipe symptoms shouldn’t expect transmit. link too. Sweden pretty much EU country report every day? congress people intelligent return place, virus air. think he's talking essential workers aka grocery store cashiers bus drivers, medical workers matter? They’re still dead! seen hidden white text white background states exactly propaganda repeated? /s Good. left. It’s little conspiracy minded, guy podcast that’s exploding. popularity exploding. world gains loses absolutely nothing say, unlike Fauci. It’s best interests lead people think it’s sticking around forever. soon Covid done/managed fade complete obscurity. first herd immunity, they're too, since measures recommend changed much. think herd immunity approach would lead looks like less average excess mortality Europe. social circle, one hanging April. Trust me, friends far paranoid covid, still nobody socializing. 

People started seeing friends limited capacity May. April legitimately dead. People weren’t riding subway, scared take Uber. Bloomberg article says includes catch weekend. poops matter week ago, local health department administrator quoted saying know next batch vaccine coming many doses shipment would contain. seems Biden people Trump people engaging really wishful thinking availability second doses. take sure benefit maybe possibly benefit every single time, especially don’t even know vaccine stops people carriers. vaccinating 17 year old cashier help still infect 15 vulnerable people?  thinking thing! state opened 75s bunch essential employees (based previous CDC recommendations). I'm curious pivot since they've signed bunch 75s vaccination based employer. Slightly missing many cases especially 14% positivity rates right would bring actual death rate significantly asymptomatic mild cases Mexico bad even know is? saw David Attenborough COVID article title freaked f out. i've seen back head hooks instead ear hooks (think thicker, stronger string dollar store halloween mask) They're extending time second dose 12 weeks. jinx it!  cold shipment/storage problem, least Pfizer vaccine. 

Everything ""just time"".

Just tell I'll bring chair, book, sandwich bottle water, I'll get line wait. unaware UK doling proper intervals. ton strains already recent ones taking serious. Pretty sure original wuhan strain almost extinct mutated europe study made bell curve incubation time?

I know average 7-8 curious percentage people get sooner later 7-8 days sure get vaccine invite call appointment, schedule shots guess also reserve two doses then. Yay, whole family consider risk NY make cut off!!!  Lol same. Gotta pump numbers up. rookie numbers! is. bullshit arguments too. “Cure worse disease”, “this freedom”, “people die accidents anyway”.

A decent chunk American public is...rather..... dim :/ Good move. 

Hope helps cut vaccine tourism Florida. governor finally admitted people world coming Florida need 65+ get vaccine. 

Meanwhile, Florida’s supply still determined population actually lives here. 

No end sight 65, matter health occupation. 🤷‍♀️ Didn’t say way. US haven’t even started giving old people yet like said would. far called essential workers medical people getting it. bunch politicians. rest people good strategy would use vaccines varying effectiveness

plot twist:  country? Low genetic diversity boon came along pandemic. Instead new stable strains, get new clades sub-clades gene deletion, mostly similar originals outside increased transmisibility (D614G mutation B117 two examples). low genetic diversity makes easier target vaccination. also makes much less likely pandemic lead many future new pandemic/epidemic viruses like 1918 H1N1 pandemic (H2N2, H3N2, etc...). separate posts since rules changed mods specifically told post here. takes 2 seconds scroll past post, lifetime. stack kids put trench coat mustash bring vacinated.

It's like telling someone Barcelona live Spanish city. might technically correct make friends saying it. Thank Professor Farnsworth I'm saying use pharmacies, valid way get shots arms looked upon. I've gotten lot vaccinations years local CVS, least pharmacy specific staff deals vaccinating people come in. yes pharmacy deserts exist vaccine administration method, vast majority Americans live pharmacy deserts ignoring infrastructure place rely government run vaccination centers slow us Record low majority flu cases recorded covid. There's lot similar symptoms hey, definitely flu force people obey Currently, CDC official recommendation whether people covid get vaccinated. decide, they’ll need consider number issues, including much natural immunity people recover COVID-19 infection. question still straightforward answer.

The vaccines haven’t well-studied yet people recovered covid. vaccine developers reporting mild moderate side effects study groups, many groups include people already fought COVID.

And course like mentioned, vaccines already short supply, natural immunity now, would better serve society end pandemic someone else receive dose, become widely available. reasoning president company gave it’s important return office deal sensitive information like ssns, salaries, etc. again, already flex schedule before. really wish could find job 100% remote move without worrying finding new job. 

As right now, target date go back office May, I’m sure get moved back. Took em long enough grow balls  mean, wait. estimates people get virus can't get least several months. sure get vaccine immune little while. It’s done state level. know.

However, reason ended imposing curfew people stop holding gatherings kept spreading virus increasing pace.

Gatherings illegal least month cities province, yet people defied government kept getting cases. limiting movement (which majorly inconvenient), hoping limit gatherings.

We never needed limit gatherings close anything people adopted minor inconveniences washing hands, wearing masks keeping distances. people mean saying ""we many studies show"", not. reasons believe may stop spread, studied far released vaccine trials. don’t like messaging California, clearly isn’t working. First extend restrictions “indefinitely” proceed vaccine slowly take way long focusing hospital employees see patients, Seniors wait, although seems finally Nursing homes 75+ seeing vaccines barely. states quickly deployed vaccine elderly like know... pandemic deadly people!   work really small software company Canada (less 10 people) mainly services oil gas sector. boss always one “I need physically see working” type people back March everything shut went remote forced adopt new school work mentality. saw still productive eased completely.

We’re never going back office. lease September boss already said set permanent. personally love it. time, save money, don’t deal commuting dreadful winters. company saves money too; rent (once lease up), bus passes staff, lower electric bills, lower phone bills since forward calls cells rotation now, don’t need dozen lines office. We’ll probably rent super cheap satellite office mail purposes, won’t mandatory attend. 

It crazy see unfold. 2 weeks March turned early summer, quickly turned September, quickly turned forever. know people sort trickled back offices Summer, city’s recommending work home again, opinion there’s point even trying go back that’s new norm. you? get downvoted oblivion think people fake seen insane amounts fake injuries work.

If makes sense consistent enough I'll believe it. They've failed consistent enough times take high school. Considering younger children seem spread much elder ones. right decision.

The closing 'högstadier' took far remember. 11th dec. 2020 precise. information found keeping schools open gives herd immunity faster closed schools.

They close schools. besides, looking FHM's emails seems counting children driving force spreading virus, concluded might worth keeping schools open ""achieve herd immunity faster"". Upstate NY hoping every vaccinated fall timeline change vaccines approved CDC changing recommendations. That's works. production still ramped up. last schedule read magic 70% reached September, unless specific adverse events cause delays (e.g. mutations render whole vaccine useless, large-scale accidents render whole vaccine factories unusable). According schedule, least half vaccinations administered July September.

Until then, get winter summer hopefully going favor. get again.

Yeah, no.

You also remember B117 others mutations, couple new (more infectious) players entered game, that's reason step security measures short term, wait new vaccines arrive.  People insisting things name stopping spread aren’t supported science though. example, it’s proven surface spread big vector transmission yet still people obsessively sanitizing things. Back around Halloween criticized parenting group saying trick treating could done safely masks distancing especially people set bowls porch table. people jumped gave “hard no” kids would sticking hands bowl. CDC also considers exposure it’s 10 minutes, close distance, unmasked meaning even traditional trick treating would terribly risky. people stayed home misguided sense fear going trick treating would super dangerous/reckless.

This respiratory virus. It’s new one, sure, it’s contagious. behaves exactly would expect respiratory virus to. aren’t going get stepped outside without mask.

NHS things differently.  we'll 5k deaths reported today, JFC. It’s far risky people 60-65. make half population? they’re vaccinated (or get recover), rates keep dropping. hospitals woods, there’s reason keep stuff closed forever. locked won’t kill you,
Not seeing relatives/friends won’t kill you,
Not going vacation won’t kill you,
Working home won’t kill you.

None kill you, make what’s going acceptable. Primarily insanely slow vaccine rollout implementing measures calling “solidarity”  Read rules.  Oh thank god... nobody around 20s spread around. I’m saying everyone 20s first line. you’re someone going bars clubs raves 7 days week, shouldn’t excluded you’re much higher threat elderly elderly getting vaccinated. endearing see people age 65 use Reddit. I’m fascinated it! age group went much technological changes- landing moon super computer pocket. Witnessing swing technology must fascinating. 

Cheers many years you! look true downsides lockdowns. kill. getting cheeseburger not.

Look Canada. 27 times excess deaths 45 demographic, includes Canadians, Covid deaths. higher excess death causes age groups percentage even Sweden. majority excess deaths 45s Canada caused drug overdoses suicides.

Sweden opposite situation: Covid deaths excess deaths causes.

lockdowns kill.  Yes and? Relatively get less federal money, state tax make really consider surplus  Thankfully, changed. source? making things up? Well already plenty people like life I’m filled there. family accept death certificate means would admit virus consider hoax real. impossible. cannot must be.  50.38% global effectiveness announced today butantan institute são paulo gov agree. Even Tennessee? number #1 last week basically issue. services went curbside, essential workers could focus jobs smaller chance outbreak, focus cleaning bathrooms break rooms since customers store, much easier contact tracing case outbreak. service needs person appointment only. Enforcing safety guidelines would also help.

Instead gave hoped Plexiglas would protect them. Pfizer approved 16-18, even that's little better kids all! saw Johnson Johnson trials 12-15 age group.... hopefully goes well too! Oh goody... stage 4 Karens disease. :-/ Can't repeated often enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Who government thought vaccinating 3 million Canadians Q1 enough? agreed vaccines delivered March earlier quarter? Paywall... understanding scientifically PROVED vaccine means cannot pass along. Basically cannot give ppl vax purposefully infect one interact. cannot say 100% prevents spread. prevents 95% symptomatic covid (and remember lot people spreading ""asymptomatically"" really PRE symptomatic meaning eventually got symptoms) would think prevent great deal spread, even scientifically proven study yet. im thinking totally wrong someone correct me! Also, could maybe get ""waiting list"" extra vaccine? relative called unused vaccine go bad. Smallpox eradicated mass vaccination. trouble herd immunity involves people getting sick eventually immune people die something else new people born don’t immunity. one reason child mortality high immunization common childhood diseases available widely. vaccine isn’t medication. It’s unknown whether vaccinated person transmit virus. Hopefully data soon.

If transmit, assumed far lower rate unvaccinated person would. dry plastic box. really. measures become stricter rigorous time.

The important change probably recommendation health care personnel wear face masks face shields.

Then limited amount people allowed gather time.

No alcohol 22.

Closed high schools + gymnasier.

Face masks rush think herd immunity approach would lead looks like less average excess mortality Europe.

Doesn't sound unlikely considering population density on. think fair compare us Scandinavian neighbours. I'm expert read lot research papers scientific article. would expect mRNA specific benefit protection mutations. 

It comes protein structure selected vaccine train immune system respond to, whether mutation affects protein structure substantially.

We're going find effective switch full protection masks, though Germans probably still many indoor gatherings friends/family. Saying n95 cloth masks foolish statement.

But nobody actually said that. responded People using cloth surgical masks almost nothing.

Which false, *as source says*. save thought sure would hard Google, popped second answer. Thank. God. protected like International Treasure. man fostered love respect nature countless people around globe. earned way life ever able give him. damned well better front every line. Keep going I'm almost finished... sort agree, sort disagree. Lockdowns closures work extent worth it, despite economic hit. people actually stay home gather publicly privately. worked back March April people afraid listened. Now, people fatigued gathering privately, causing spread. agree we’re going actually lock maybe it’s worth economically close businesses.

But hand, hospitals overloaded, reduction counts. Even businesses account 10-20% spread, that’s still increase now. would say vaccines distributed hospitals away brink overload, position makes sense. ""worst outbreak"" probably due infectious strains talk everywhere, matter whether mutated locally imported elsewhere.

Let's hope Chinese vaccines immunize mutated variants like Western counterparts - mutation new one causes issues vaccines. Azealia Banks cooked cat, long talking pet stew. Gotta respect walking talk Vaccinated still become infected, risk severe disease dying greatly reduced. still spread virus, asymptomatic, get sick - sick, however. take months years burn out, might burn instead become seasonal, perhaps worse depenDing mutations. COVID remains loaded gun even vaccination. sayin' send unused american doses here, cant appreciate privileged ass getting, atleast give stuck 8+ months YES! logistics reserving second vaccine dose also administering new ones biggest problem right Canada, kids already school without masks.

There’s way doesn’t role preventing containing future pandemics. guy go back day job lose sponsorship money Fauci isn’t getting anyways. dude people dying left right dont think everyone go hospital, friend works doctor, hospitals get like 10% covid cases pinky, fucker useless 3 weeks ago people saying hospital system collapse nationwide 2-3 weeks. Clearly major driver increasing case counts increased testing, doomsday predictions would've come true. Thankfully, didn't. today death. today  various committees involved bureaucracy CA's vaccine rollout need determine whether best interest fairness collective ass lit. Yeah, it’s like there’s global issue anything, giving emotional speeches claiming biggest crisis since WWII surely wins votes.  suprised? 

i bet Sputnik going same...

these countries can't trust, opinion 🤷🏻‍♂️ get nasal congestion winter good happened, need one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine really speed things up. production capacity second none efficacy vaccine possibly higher, making better use at-risk groups. Still, good see AstraZeneca moving forward. Good right thing! hope Norway treated well holidays die salt poisoning pinnekjøtt smoked fish. claim originally staked reasonable skeptical COVID vaccines humans rushed two pandemic vaccines market before, times debacle.

And reasoning use support pandemics bad expected. cannot accurately say ""pandemic vaccines unsafe"" standalone statement worst one twice safe taking Tylenol. possibly say ""vaccines released response pandemic higher rate side effects vaccines,"" even still, extremely safe compared medical treatment. curiosity, think infection fatality rate COVID is?

The exact IFR COVID relevant. IFR Ebola high, Ebola vaccine given worldwide, be, kid Boise, Idaho essentially zero chance contracting it. COVID, hand, spread throughout world year, overwhelmed medical capacity numerous areas, that's despite restrictions mitigation measure never seen lifetimes. IFR disease infects 10 people matter much global perspective, neither IFR disease infects 100 million people. could less deadly per-case flu (and certainly isn't) would still dangerous sheer number people infects. technically incorrect, likely reduce transmission.  never clearer significant display income disparity modern history.

The damage done, understand many us refuse see this. idea unwilling many admit erroneous behavior societal scale.  Get tested act accordingly. mandatory lot private enterprises would let partake offer without vaccine, likely international travel. Well see, apparently pandemic much pressing matter politicians. Psst -- mask violates requirements since essentially wearing one. cannot assume sick. idiot, please. cover exhaust valves cloth equivalent. one really knows cause study it. probably wont able get vaccine provider give 10 days early. line thinking well. pragmatic terms, vaccinating 100 people today effective vaccinating 50 people today hoarding 2nd doses weeks/months.

Also, lots people taking seriously. people stop caring we're going start spiraling get herd immunity vaccinations. I’m sorry parents think bubble wrapping kids solution. 

That really truly sucks. 

Have always like this? allowed walk around town alone? Play contact sports? guess wait millions people vaccinated considerable time since vaccination started. Probably reconsider. make sure meet people risk then.  Seriously. “No one truly safe everyone safe” one asinine completely unviable axioms I’ve seen long time. one 100% safe ever. Trying get people believe false sense security stupid.

Also, acting like SARS-CoV-2 won’t behave like viruses know about? It’s “well don’t know” everything immune response vaccines operate. makes sense. 2-dose vaccination regime makes 2x sales. No? 

Definitely. would efficacy two dose regimen move needle? *scientific* problem *marketing* problem. 

Assume J&amp;J's one dose regimen 91% effective confidence interval 86% 94%; efficacy would J&amp;J's two dose regimen achieve make effective? Well, confidence interval Pfizer's vaccine 90.3% 97.6% point estimate 95.0%, better Pfizer prove superiority one dose regimen. might nit-picking some, confidence intervals overlap, that's true superiority, confidence interval include 94% low end. two dose regimen would really efficacious clear bar. 

That's scientific problem: get 90% efficacy, difficult find regimen prove superior. 

Now marketing problem. patient already vaccinated one dose regimen, get second vaccination? Patients may say worth it, especially told need another dose. Insurance companies may say enough benefit pay. Doctors may willing recommend without strong push larger physician community. 

If receive J&amp;J vaccine, I'm going want another dose whenever get it; I'll pay insurance won't. lot people agree. 

So, guess J&amp;J execs thought single dose regimen going less 90% effective committed trial two dose regimen. I'm still hoping wrong! Even community behaved normally would still benefiting lack spread areas Oh yeah? Well I'm going get it. I've stuck apartment year go outside every two weeks social life go anywhere lots people. yeah...good luck getting me!

Im essential worker NY still know I'd eligible. doubt many college students prolonged interactions elderly. Focus vaccinating risk, spreaders, critical metrics fall way faster. 18 hrs. Got shot mid afternoon, woke around 2 feeling horrible, symptoms lasted next evening. Yeah pandemic try avoid public spaces. I'm public I'm really worried getting flu. I'm vaccinated covid ill get vaccine flu. Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. 2020 COVID-19 wild ride, seems fitting. Also, like Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. thought whole tiered roll profession thing good idea first think maybe open 65+ let whoever get it. things going people's arms fast supply problem demand. Yep. Things get worse even year year basis. thanks  asking yet provide them. think agenda is? believe want humanity wiped virus? don’t reason believe vaccines cause autism.

Sure. risks everything. question whether tell truth risks.

There also difference knowing conspiracies possible happen, skeptical, believing something evidence for. skeptic says “I’m sure” nothing that. skepticism warranted time don’t trust counter party. 

Sure, hear saying. Maybe greater good. Maybe saved lives poison alcohol prohibition letting people free drink it. Actually almost certainly would saved lives took- ban alcohol actually worked slow spread alcohol. poison killed 900 people, peanuts compared many alcohol killed. isn’t conspiracy. conspiracy withholding truth. lot pragmatism. Much easier hospital grab whole employee register total report “I need 865 vaccines” spend time wading classify occupation. hospital ‘done’ doesn’t need consideration regard initial rollout. true larger scale (govt departments, whole healthcare agencies, etc). 

Plus lot ancillary roles use hospital shops, cafeterias, doors, bathrooms, etc involved direct payment care. latest documentary sounded much like testament:( Thanks detailed explanation. makes clear selection bias towards resistant supervirus inside poorly vaccinated individuum. think effect social behavior adaptions? large group poorly vaccinated people believe ""immune"" consequence lower protections (masks, distancing, hygiene, stay home), catalyse natural resistant mutation? (I mean catalyse group people, either vaccinated all, fully vaccinated per field study).

I'm asking dumb way really want know. guess people expose natural virus soon may equivalent (albeigh dangerous than) getting second dose, I'd like remove doubts. *During* acute emergency phase pandemic necessary scientific intervention. *Post-acute emergency* represents low-bandwidth, puritanical sterile world. Facial expressions high-bandwidth form communication idea public spaces require protective gear beautiful thing keep around emergency phase ends vaccines protect hospitals. confuse now. bad Canada right now? I've honestly stopped paying attention countries since we've handled poorly. makes want move. Cases seem peaked already. wait hospital admissions peak, followed deaths. Still Cells also. 

Anyways got fever day fine next day. I'm worried.

Don't plans get vaccine years everything known it. gonna UK. want go concert mosh badly. can't believe miss feeling stranger's nasty sweaty body bouncing are. That's true long run, yes. take brother dollar store give $50 $500,000, tell whoever spends higher percentage money next 30 minutes wins, going win every time. Umm, why? business harming anyone 

Perhaps missed part there's deadly pandemic raging **democratically-elected** government determined curfew needed? case one throw trials use one was, i.e. one. 

Aggregating insignificant trials different circumstances bad science. much Israel vaccinated? Vaccinating 3% population make cases go down. 

Also, people US vaccinating - first batch hospitals care homes - less likely spreaders, probably expect cases start rising dramatically deaths visibly falling. idea Israel following strategy mitigation rather suppression, however. Especially unusual event Disneyland ton people driving visit. That's literally happens every day open. I'm disagreeing you, source? sounds amazing, given current push release held doses. Okay, guess truly entered Brave New World case. environmental disaster! Reddit, fucking scare like this... Seeing Sir David Attenborough Covid-19 sentence fucking terrifying! kids probably figured themselves.   one gonna look reviews stores. Seems government care people following rules not. stores make people wait outside limit capacity like supposed to. sick since Winter started outdoor activities ceased thing. Nobody know wants hang and, much want to, think could either.

During summer saw people outdoors times least cold people see annoying coworkers.  interesting, possible temperature gauge incorrect? another one use check it? 

Do feel fine otherwise? I'd reach doctor. It’ll tempered significantly though fact he’s old. People memories “I remember ... died” shocking, unprepared for, seemed wrong due youth.

Attenborough old everyone anticipating he’ll die sometime soon. won’t Jackson, Diana Kennedy effect view. Still sad though. Thank God. anything happens guy fuck lockdown, we'll 3 months mourning. Long live Sir David. [Some epidemiologists need masks full herd immunity every part country ""no commercial cost,"" going take lot longer widespread availability. Fauci saying Fall, even elderly vaccinated full herd immunity, theaters ""back normal"" though masks required, linguistically follows masks part definition ""normal.""

Presumably, police significant workload without barely staffed for. They'd end spending whole day supermarkets would also bad own. kids follow news coverage. favorite social media ""influencer' posted it, then...Mmmmm maybe... doubt though.

That like someone attempting form haiku mid-stroke. last year RBG. states actual people distributing vaccine getting hang it. Everything slower beginning people really know they're doing.  debates He's one leading animal conservation activists/teachers entire life I've got elderly relative Oregon driving nuts watching rollout UK.

Here, everyone 70 first dose mid February latest, seems like Oregon it'll closer April. we're whole lot faster USA, guys decided vaccinate many people ahead elderly. absurd going kill many people. probably simply infective.  

If (numbers completely made up) infect 1.9 people average flu, social distancing masks cut half: pandemic every flu patients infects less one person virus dies down.   

If infect 3 people averae corona - masks &amp; social distancing also cut half: pandemic going 5 kids Pfizer Moderna efficacy announcements kind fault that. People hold every vaccine almost unnatainable (for countries) standard, without considering high cost produce, low supply trouble properly store.

Most us (including me) know nothing vaccines look numbers say ""oh, 95 good, 75 good 50 bad"", lot gray area envolved. guidance suggests sort concern child individually unsupervised (eg large classroom setting) and/or cannot sufficiently trained correct usage mask (eg immature / unclear risks). psychological impact concern long-term regular use single trip supermarket, might half hour sold adventure (she's also free take bothers her).

Thanks. guess question whether doses human trials enough job.

Most I've hearing Ivermectin via [This Week recent weeks. virologists seemed impressed yet, go-to physician (Daniel Griffin, parasitic disease expert treated patients it) hailing miracle drug. recall somebody show mentioning different countries' regulatory agencies allow much higher dosages FDA does; might take digging find whether Zagazig University trial doses within FDA limits. Same. even walk stairs bad. 

I antibody test late June 2020, came back negative, would anyway guess leave Yelp reviews stores. I'm sure Yelp allows leave feedback specific COVID stores.

It would interesting experiment someone try out. bullshit. people stop thinking numbers reported country actual number deaths last 24 hours? Every single report contains backlog. Care elaborate? People getting vaccine *also* leaves protection. MUCH better use vaccines rather hold back quite unlikely case manufacturing fails somewhere road. Hmmm read it, wasn’t really much kids apologising. think title article somewhat click-bait. agree. unfortunately trust isn’t something naturally arises for-profit industry. Skepticism warranted, breeches trust inevitably happen, warranting skepticism. don’t blame skeptics one bit. Right? mass Dunning-Krueger certainty going comments. hard people admit don’t know?  I'm saying ""general population"" meaningless term. could herd immunity get ""general population"", includes literally 100 million people. That's lot normal, every day, regular people. everyone afford 2 weeks quarantine random Airbnb potentially upon coming back too. countries banned hotels operating unless ""essential business travel"". Anyone emigrated chance better life pretty much kissed families goodbye end 2019 without knowing know many years.  Fauci! Focus vaccination distribution issue. Movies shit later, capisce? That's literally working right now.

But since similar Oxford Chinese ones, surprised 60-80%. still really good vaccines general. Double dose might help well boost up, study apparently still progress others said. weren’t listening right people. 100% expected anyone knows anything infectious diseases. actually see OP saying. Cuomo literally saying word word shit Trump got crucified for. Trump said “The cure can’t worse virus” got bashed Cuomo essentially say thing it’s fine.

And fucking hate Trump, despise him; would drag hell could, it’s weird seeing switch I’ve found younger patients asking flu shot. 

My older patients (40+) don’t ask, decline almost every time offer it. anyway excluding possibility actual crossover event happened long virus became meaningfully infectious virulent? I'm reading study correctly (big if), answer question ""How far back find people antibodies, people live?"" seems ""As far back we've looked we've looked."" I'm sure negative findings elsewhere. 

I thinking China claiming origin elsewhere non-political reason, policy choices regard wet markets transparent disease surveillance criminal put world large risk pandemic disease, finding consistent two closely related strains Italy Wuhan (if elsewhere) undergoing similar mutations heavy selective pressure similar times? I'd still surprised crossover happen China, seem consistent crossover event mutations allow rapid spread virulent virus closely linked geographically. Gotcha. Thanks sharing, it’s interesting perspective! saying happy 100 mil vaccinations? never seen epidemic curve like this, curve *with* lockdown. variant becomes common U.S., it’s close worst-case scenario, baseline full hospitals,” said.

Logistically, hospitals nursing homes actually harder. spread out. move mass vaccination sites, instead every individual nursing home getting vaccinations, you’ll like one giant vaccination center per area.

We’re already seeing stadiums opening vaccination sites. stadiums thousands vaccinations per day. distribution standpoint, it’s easier get 1000 vaccines one stadium get 1000 vaccines 100 nursing homes. “their selfishness”.

Like said though, US, happens lot, without pandemic. can't speak Ireland. Aww brightened day! said title 'Sir' reserved knights, not? “Sir David Attenborough, 94, beloved naturalist documentarian, surrounded family, peacefully passes onto list people vaccinated COVID-19.” half really ideological. anti-lockdown ""side"" also expected check everything else list, like anti-mask, anti-vaccine, think virus real threat, etc. also heavily associated conservative right now, people see right-wing also take ideological positions default. Follow excess deaths. Archived link: people would riot COVID restrictions already that. want put like that, anyone die COVID. However, younger person gets COVID less likely end hospital die.

It seems like prioritizing reduction cases rather reduction serious disease death. Vaccinating elderly would save lives reduce hospitalizations, makes room car crash victims, patients heart attacks strokes, and, yes, younger COVID patients.

You also consider vaccination easier open people certain age. need ID verify they're least minimum age. also prevents confusion essential employee, prevents corporations lobbying get employees list (such Uber, suddenly cares well-being independent contractors). honestly? Let people eligible get vaccinated there's way get dose arm someone currently eligible expires. France prodvide everyone.
But big deal every virus except coronavirus family, almost non existant.
There less 10 detected cases France hospital far 2 came foreign country.
We thanks mask gel ! Hygienism good asset. could wipe virus earth. Sadly stay way. think changing spacing vaccine good idea, scientifically. However, vaccine production increasing exponentially, might easy enough plan second dose someone even physically freezer yet, especially stage. guidelines stops good idea (i.e. vaccine production becomes stop-gap). Would loved gotten air marshall talk certain Senator seen flying without proper mask usage month ago. Thats true. 
Many stores open April. people scared covid. Right now, people afraid roughly restrictions well store owners following health guidelines. “fuller” April. 
I’d drive Northern blvd flushing Astoria. many people lots stores open. Lots ambulances.
The now. Take cars streets you’ll see number od ambulances driving neighborhoods YAS! lot people going need vaccinated stores drop mask policies. yeah, early vaccinated people likely use mask longer want groceries.

Ironic anti-mask crowd partly responsible that. could trust people wear mask unless vaccinated, maybe could’ve taken approach. Well here's COVID mutating point vaccine effectiveness significantly reduced months since clearly there's case new strains/variants due stupidity self imposed herd immunity. I'm going risk even told 1 M&amp;M 33000 M&amp;Ms poisonous. point even playing afford avoid together. think key need plan virtual queue sort. people like seeing 80 year olds lawn chairs blankets waiting overnight lines get vaccine. type free good recipe keep people safe. That's working great Hawaii right now. confirmed now. Online availability seem issue

Here 100 masks 25 euros real guess people problems physical stores. resellers amazon run increased prices, plenty sellers available unlikely manufacture would severely disrupted anyway.

**Mumps:**

The infection fatality rate mumps 1 10,000 well. problem mumps causes deafness. Interestingly vaccine confer robust, life-long immunity days people get it, tend get much older age cause infertility men. 

**Rubella:**

Rubella scarcely fatal, cause occasional serious complications well birth defects expectant mothers infected.

**Tetanus:**

The tetanus vaccine one really get behind. Horrible disease, ubiquitious pathogen, high fatality rate. Big fan. 

**DTP:**

The DTP vaccine (the old one) associated 10 fold increase all-cause mortality one interesting study:

[The Introduction Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis Oral Polio Vaccine Among Young Infants Urban African Community: Natural Experiment used industrialized nations more. use DTaP, presume safer.

**HiB:**

HiB sounds bad, know much it.

**Poliomyelitis:**

Polio fascinating one. Polio fecal-oral disease modern sanitation good hygiene widely adopted, kids would exposed ubiquitous bug infants. Death rare children generally protected maternal antibodies, recovered immune life. Outbreaks, happened, small, widespread epidemics never occurred thanks natural herd immunity.
 
Then 20th Century indoor plumbing, modern sewage systems, personal hygiene became commonplace, kids longer exposed poliovirus mother's teat. Basically ""dry tinder"" situation arose whereby millions susceptible, immune-naive children accumulated population, ground work laid horrible epidemic. Cue black white footage gymnasiums full little kids iron lungs...

Anyhoo. polio vaccine godsend course, polio cases outbreaks caused vaccine strain wherever OPV still use. wild type exists mountainous hinterlands Pakistan Afghanistan tribal culture, isolation, mistrust outsiders prevents mass vaccination. least that's say. 

Here's truth bomb you: kid Boise, Idaho essentially zero chance getting polio, mass vaccination polio nonsensical mass vaccination yellow fever. Ironically, kid still probably get vaccine possible might one day visit country OPV still use, there's remote possibility might get VDPP. 

Targeted vaccination campaigns IPV (OPV's much safer successor) sensible thing IMO.

**Smallpox:**

Smallpox eradication one mankind's crowning achievements IMO, gone now, one US soldiers gets vaccine anymore. 

In sum, vaccines powerful tools, absolutely save lives reduce human misery, they're panacea. used judiciously caution. what's sensible person assume they're safe worthwhile expert TV says so. 

**Back Cherry Picking:**

Providing evidence back stated claim cherry picking. That's called staking position. make claim provide evidence support it. like, make counter claim provide evidence support it. go back forth like that, called debate. cherry picking. debate. always worked. 

Now evidence refute claim skepticism new pandemic vaccines warranted based complete shit history rushed pandemic vaccines, fucking 'er. shouting ""cherry picking!"" backed intellectual corner juvenile. actually joking? hideous argument I've heard giving priority healthcare workers. cares, they're ones caring patients sick covid everything else right? quit likely sending families bankruptcy?

Even best case scenarios include additional vaccines approved project us eligible adults vaccinated late year. vaccine even tested kids yet. Progress good progress almost over. Really? You’re going prevent hideous burn victim hiring prostitute because...you’re therapist won’t help? Ok pal. plan COVID thing. accept life come guarantee safety, can't force entire world cater interests population (many expect world cater them). article linked support claim logistically easier vaccinate people healthcare nursing home. says far vaccination disaster much improve. Also open public faster vaccinate lot people CVS, pharmacies vaccination centers come equation. easy task faster. year demand flu shot way supply book appointment. thing covid vaccine. Whether choose prioritize certain age groups depend country/state. Correct wait still US data?

We wait US data.

AZN approved UK, India Mexico (with Brazil scheduled week). rerun test US botching first one expecting results anytime soon (latest I've heard Spring - probably April).

We're going see EUA AZN anytime soon, despite fact Brits currently putting arms. likely tens millions humans who've AZN vaccine FDA even considers EUA. Canadian, makes mad. We're going hella slow. They’re keeping together? put Zoom calls other. needs socialization, right? best guess 3 years. 

Anyway, company already working flu+covid vaccine, flu vaccine may get replaced one. already making 50% cases there. majority strain Europe, maybe world unless even transmissible variant outmuscles it. 

It's simple natural selection. Old people much bigger % population Florida NY. Makes sense it'll take longer Florida get groups people, assuming old people prioritized be. There's also data people health problems like down's syndrome, cerebral palsy etc. They're likely die complications health conditions rather virus. Unlike West invests lot healthcare individuals. No, bad gets. source make claim *how many* people come Florida vaccine. means nothing, odds make tiny fraction vaccines issued far. asshole COVID WENT ZOO FED GORILLAS contaminated food?! idea getting voted this. pretty clear number included weekend shots. vaccines open people 65 don’t conditions majority population gotten wants get them, I’d expect mask requirements go away places.

The attitude going worried COVID, get vaccine. makes sense me. think biggest problem everyone creates false dichotomy. Anti-lockdown people act like people want lockdown forever instead long enough relieve hospitals, people want lockdown act like opposite true. bunch herded room one point safety? Another commenter thread said someone handing masks refusing laughing. think that's referring says that's / got listen, get mean. pedantic, get it.

I responding word ""trust"" way people trust them

few people trust them... what? 

I believe intended bein general range ""few people trust [to citizen's best interests heart]"". 

My point need that. need ""trust [that they'll pursue interests, happen intersect yours, case]"".


""Trust"", like many words (see ""respect"") wiggly context dependent.


but mind pedantry, good define terms Even country buy doses, vaccine coming means less competition vaccines, country benefit regardless. Gotcha. Thanks! ""What got here, failure communicate"" think merits both. Vaccinating “frontline” workers (people contact lot people) certainly lower cases much vaccinating seniors would. think need considered sure would like see J&amp;J vaccine approved effective, convenience, get people vaccinated sooner! hard verify occupations, age. We’re going back normal soon fast ! so? industry well regulated wouldn’t case. Practically countries legalized it.  going sound ""both sides""-y, anti-lockdown heavily pro-lockdown people pretty much go way far extreme every time Fauci talks.

I'm scientist I've wanting decent debate reddit whole pandemic. dogma, dogma, dogma. Even hint anti-lockdown argument (even used promote anti-lockdown behavior) people quote piece comment, ""disprove"" anecdotes, alternative facts, extremely bad math, dm personal, politically charged insults. hint saying restrictions might worth vaccine widely available (e.g. masks public transport), get angry messages illogical slippery slope arguments anti-lockdown crowd. single person I've talked reddit able entertain idea fit narrative without getting emotional.  think people quick criticize “slow start”. can’t imagine world entire country logistical plans vaccinate 20M people end 2020. start always going slow

People also **way** quick blame political shenanigans There’s reason world leading evidence based organization found there’s evidence support efficacy yet. there’s numerous large studies showing increases cancer risk due daily multivitamins. can’t go make unfounded assumptions expect reality.

Not mention giving people false sense security. Biden plan 100 million shots administered first 100 days administration pushing team hard make sure plan going workable successful keep mind 10 days we’re leader who’s actually focused solving problem getting country open safely. Supply chain issues. Getting everyone two doses hard enough specific first second vaccines even tougher. reason sending kids school vaccine becomes available. Homeschool us. Socializing kids problem. zoom face face cousins staying home vaccine comes also.  It'll work - Ron Desantis started December, that's know. It’s sexist criminalize behavior behavior mostly committed one gender. 

If majority people reprimanded breaking dress code work women, necessitate dress code sexist? dress code exactly enforced equally men women? course not. 

Theft already illegal. Plenty healthcare workers lost job due pandemic. Decreased elective surgeries = bye bye hospital revenue = adios jobs. yeah like 1.9k upvotes? clearly attention love given this, seems like death destruction around here. Getting *second shot* least concerns. Getting first shot top list :-). something always want emphasize. get flu every year? No. get side effects flu shot every year? Yes.

Do side effects compared way shape form flu? No.

I get side effects flu shot, get actual flu. suffer side effects get know, personal experience witnessing others, way ACTUAL FLU.

I take side effects flu shot actual flu EVERY SINGLE TIME. personally know two people got vaccinated today. Super excited I’ve become wired read “COVID” “record XX Million” get really depressed.

[33% workers said felt engaged work Gallup poll years  Lol, kind ass backwards logic this? could 1) give vaccines old people don’t die, 2) give vaccines young people hopefully won’t spread COVID old people won’t die. people may young healthy prevent spreading others get infected. Wow aren’t joking Canada 1.25 million vaccinated today. ramping too. get better here!! wet market China. Gotta look Israel too. 80 percent 70+ vaccinated Wow could seen coming get really quiet. think covid deaths mislabeled. probably that. Vaccines isolating well masks distancing. works together. San Diego Zoo Safari Park.... aren’t naming gorillas, don’t want doxx them. Thank injecting little bit hope day. truly hope analysis correct. got second dose today. havent seen n95 masks since march? still shortage around sure... really hard say without exact particulars model. think model meant used guide though actual prediction. case relative outcomes really matter absolute estimates. 

I think user reading much analysis October many assumptions may longer realistic. Stop using word “record” Healthcare workers people. come religious, political educational knowledge. strong background science, task oriented work. takes kinds. Yea, would buy bigger quantity. shipping free. like Los Angeles. :( That's true cases huge proportion deaths vulnerable groups start coming fairly soon. yet seems go, blue bubbles! many questions regarding vaccine ! I'll err side caution think Hispanic mothers best.  careful say her.  day reminded younger would make gorditas de carne cold rainy days next thing know knocking door wrapped aluminum foil hot tea. love mom!!!! offense, “your thoughts” quarter get phone call. coming vaccine guidelines CDC prepared pretty extensive modeling impact vaccinating old folks versus vaccinating essential workers concluded vaccinating old folks first would save something like 30,000 lives (I don’t remember exact number). trust science answer clear. CDC obviously still recommended vaccinating essential workers first, nothing effectiveness (it purely racial issue, didn’t want give vaccines old folks first since they’re mostly white). hope things get better guys soon. Definitely sticky situation everybody hopefully make moves help educators students feel safer. probable reason influenza disappearing reduced travel forced quarantining travellers China, especially Guangdong province Hong Kong. known decades influenza primarily comes region. 

The flu virus usually jumps poultry pigs humans. 

In case H5N1 virus, jumped directly poultry humans Hong Kong. 

As soon allow unrestricted travel China again, probably see influenza numbers jump back up. they're vaccinating vulnerable people first. likely people shielding anyway. Deaths might go down, cases won't.

Cases go general population start getting vaccinated. sure, aren’t currencies weighing currencies? global solution, shouldn’t absolutely nothing change? It’s like gold standard anymore live (TN), they’re seniors (75+) parallel first responders ...aaaand shut 'er back down. talking cumulative active hospitalizations. data much stable case counts changes deaths/hospitalizations always sizeable ""base"". 

That mean still reporting biases (there weekly ""breath"" measure), without turn 7-day average best source ""daily"" point data - especially state mis-reporting figures delaying reporting cause significant post-hoc changes relative base, much real time. guy says vaccine till late summer/early fall read incorrectly (probably brain used seeing anything covid-19 related going good) thought everyone given life! Rubbed eyes reread title knew one reaction. need clarity effectiveness means. vaccine 65% successful preventing infection 100% successful reducing severe illness?

I.e. “damn I’m 35% people got vaccine still got sick, least virtually chance dying it.”


If true, still good news. Yes totally got point. backing point saying “you’re right, general population probably 150 million possible 260 million.”  checked post history. fuckin mess, dude. first known apes? Trump rona?  approving J&amp;J vaccine within month?  First, Sinovac vaccine stored normal fridge temperatures, makes practical distribution developing country.

Second, explain 65% efficacy calculated (against infection? mild disease? severe disease? infections occurred soon vaccination excluded?) based 1,720 volunteers, making statistic less reliable. vaccine 78% effective trial Brazil. Although someone's spreading [rumors really less 60% knows? call 伟大光荣正确 GGRF: Great, Glorious Right Forever! like way breaking numbers.  Yikes  Russia saying 92% releasing data. sure yet.

Oxford showed like 68%, sure dose. thought Chinese one like 75%, maybe remember ring wrong. twisted tea can* Thanksgiving date around expect restrictions lifted nationwide. vaccines get approved better estimates many doses total available year, estimate might become sooner, that's counting unhatched chickens - number doses promised indicate 50% population vaccinated December, that's see everything shift previous normals. It’s going disappointing numbers lower tomorrow weekend isn’t factor reporting... lol Fauchi called it! Ready rocketing back normal :) got weblink work register info, choose location date/time.
Or facility sign there.

(Los Angeles healthcare worker.) ain’t folks California getting vaccinated. thought highest number new cases per capita No. contracts agreements, think promises purchase. Quebec run doses Wednesday get new ones. 2nd injection first people vaccinated coming soon, pretty bleak. I'm curious, say them? 😆 shall heed advice.

Trumps DONE get free corn dog one cart near fried chicken restaurant vaccinate? so, think Covid disappears week. Covid churros “vax friends parking lot” Excuse sounds stupid traditional vaccine yes? Won’t one sure prevent spreading ? seems like concerns Pfizer Moderna (not sure totally understand different)? J&amp;J traditional vaccine, whereas Moderna Pfizer mRNA. could see lot people choosing it, even protection lower. end day, we're really depending herd immunity anyway. BIL police officer decided get vaccine offered him, even though daughter immunocompromised. So.... that's fun. Got first dose morning 💉 not...once criticize motherland. China wrong. 🤣   impressive. Even ""good news"" tag misread title brain saw another negative post. comments figured out. 

I'm conditioned pessimistic Covid. downvoted linking pay wall took flat 1.25 million today assumed never got faster it, even still entire country 100% vaccination including children would vaccine 2022. I’m newborn. I’ve sick before. entire areas country people behaving like normal. flu rates like there? Plus really can't take data China face value. people say things getting better summer said working vaccine year. Given that; things back normal months. Reddit way fucking pessimistic.  spikes immune system hard day (on average). people get fatigue, body aches, etc. average day. get breathing issues. Scant details. necessarily mean failure. could still fully protective severe illness 60% effective preventing infection.

RIP immune system never get exposure mild viruses... parents 65-75 age group appointments Wed. huge weight shoulders. California fucking bad. 27% assigned doses given. It’s got 77 known immediate side effects. 6.5M?

Where getting doses 6.5M day? Covid rejected humanity returned monke Yeah, get emergency isn’t easy train someone ICU nurse. sure believing problem exists giving vaccines. could find way train people.  I'm planning vaccinated next 2 weeks part state's Stage 1b rollout. excited! blue bar steadily advancing...whoever ran round going lose. now, anybody enchanted spell delusion america knows numbers high. Given enough time, improbable becomes inevitable. Oddly, I’m surprised. Perhaps optimism reason why. seem always see glimmer light darkest times. Perhaps part human experience. I'm ER nurse hospitals shipment vaccine diverted health unit Ottawa help vaccinate prisons... Ask fucking pissed right now? Oh I'm sorry missed read comment. thought saying small rooms one two people chances unlikely got day. mistake Ireland full muh freedomers. time Ireland hand strategic control entire country Majesty's Armed Forces enforce actual lock down. people keep crying muh freedoms never happen covid cases continue climb. looked cases deaths two respective states here? don’t like Florida politically California doesn’t look like it’s going positive direction me.

Personally think dry air hurting California home state Arizona Florida. Baby, got stew going! Yes, absolutely. know people don’t always that, whether economic reasons simply need essential item store. Masks never normalize process, reduce risk.

Masks also help ambulatory “am stuffy due cold allergies” phase getting sick. Yes it’s def different ages. Developmentally toddler looks mainly parents socialization, teens less amused lol Oh gosh. So, normal mid-spring *very* possible? upvoted post sub? Amen! Honestly, you’ve got March decide say wait March making changes. Information circumstances change fast thing. point deciding to. FWIW I’d feeling really good June wedding right now, vaccine news super positive exciting. They’re related. even make insinuation? 

The data matters. simply cannot refuse accept evidence reality. Multivitamins may cause harms. Vitamin shown efficacy far. Let’s like trump accept evidence. And, arguably important, make sure hospitals enough resources. recommend everyone exercise! best shape I’ve since early 20s since literally nothing else Dang. beautifully written. don’t know beyond post enjoy writing, maybe consider pursuing post warm read. understand respect choice. kids going back person school won’t affect though. support effective distance learning families like yours. 

My kids high risk anxiety depression cannot home much longer. trying best individual situations. adults forum want continue stay home despite vaccinated bc don’t blame them. state? California says everybody get summer. sure mean start end summer That’s impossible tell honestly, don’t think states actively report numbers people refusing vaccine, 5 million per day would vaccinating approx 10% population week.  much wish wrong, think absolutely right lol  Let's run score up. get shots arms! hit September timeline current orders Pfizer/Moderna. get J&amp;J AZ ones approved too, speed things Waiting employer implement casino vaccine 100k likely take disproportionate amount medical resources. doesn’t it? Trump completely failed respond crisis. wouldn’t attend Covid meetings weeks time. new leader actually takes seriously make world difference. Post covid goal pal! Already done first shot care homes! Fantastic job Denmark, shows possible vaccinate whole population summer, even access limited deliveries EU purchasing agreement. August fantastic Denmark. hope countries follow. good seems. Many people vaccinated, demand still far outstrips supply. reach herd immunity late year. Read: we'll keep wearing masks social distancing summer. Yes! right. I’m also reading book diseases smallpox come lot mixed up. Thanks clarifying. got ASU test (saliva) got results next day. Yes, mistake identified title seems pretty common. 

But they’re announcing defiance Covid regulations, perhaps could say they’re flaunting flouting them? reason I'm super hyped this. could real game changer speed vaccinations ... doh! supposed dudette.

Interesting fun fact though, actually 1/8 Czechoslovakian. Great points, addition soon (hopefully) johnson johnson Oxford vaccines, hopefully reach April goal! churros fucking delicious billion including vaccines yet approved pipeline approval like j&amp;j vaccine Fuck 🌞 Epidemic means it’s isolated small area. Even US fully vaccinated would still pandemic based rest world. Given many developing countries much slower vaccinate spread around world don’t see happening quickly. might actually never epidemic again- go something less concern much better actually. i'm assuming happen. Adults vaccinated/naturally immune means less virus spread, means kids much lower chance catching right now, means chance catching *and* developing severe complications becomes extremely low. I've already told kids they'll likely finish school year home come fall they'll back building. think large part, per capita death rate tied population density. factor would mask wearing compliance. muscle aches, chills lot fatigue. improved Tylenol, miserable without. lasted day. noticed morning after. Pretty much colleagues similar symptoms, lucky muscle soreness. number saw somewhere, got better estimate? That’s teachers, governmental workers, grocery workers, etc. Yea see governments approving vaccines emergency use adults, harm virus far outweighs potential harm vaccine 70 years old, different kids cancer.

Only issue see giving healthy kids vaccine emergency authorization. According study Israel cant find Google, vaccinate correct 3.5 percent people prevent 90 percent deaths, means need 12 million vaccinations get top diminishing returns. Wish forever. interact apes best. hard consistent science shit. hard pressed find acceptable sample sizes, sample selection methods, and/or controls across studies anything like initial drug trials last spring Would speed things quite alot go again...in one breath ""big assumption"" next, ""eh ok data looks promising.""

It's foregone conclusion amigo. good news America free live New Normal life 2030 pleases you. God bless. Still seeing even dent daily new cases coronavirus though. can't wait see daily cases slowly start decline vaccination increases around world. fuck, California Please stop spamming troll comments like this. Thanks. I’m supposed traveling (likely air) wedding Miami early June. We’ll make it! see plenty people choosing moderna/pfizer. Pfizer/moderna brand new type vaccines mRNA. I've noticed people skeptical pfizer/moderna even though trials showed perfectly safe simply brand new technology. people probably choose J&amp;J.

And even still beneficial US one dose only. could really speed things since call person twice think would work, would need multiple doses, extra countries. Availability. good ones horded certain countries, going share dose Indonesia. poverty created capitalism, virus. faith humanity restored fine human being. easy say known anyone tested positive virus. April still looks pretty reasonable. Phase 1B actually starting roll certain parts country really good news considering we're even middle January yet. expect 1A 1B complete end February 1C begin March, phase 2 (general population) starting April. billion who? Last checked 100m moderna 200m pfizer. 150m inoculated. Could wrong order numbers. Yeah That's pretty much story understand it.  One thing I've also noticed anecdotal but, lot older Korean people know superstitious health general, use lot ""traditional"" medicine folksy home remedies. I've relatives wifes tell Koreans immune covid garlic kimchi also skeptical vaccines.  going issue 50~65 age group. I'm sure vast majority follow public health recommendations going holdouts conspiracy theorists even here. studies suggest doesn’t prevent transmission either. haven’t time study it. likelihood vaccination reduces transmission doesn’t make completely impossible. 400M? What? think 55 less contagious? load shit then.

I mean, is, feel mislead. find incredible N&amp;S Dakota green they've riding trump hump train pandemic long :/

Dont get wrong, im glad people getting vaccinated, SD governor pushing major huge public events freakin summer long.

Although I've sunning assumption vitamin help. hoping March hitting 6m vaccinations day Reuters, one single accurate unbiased news sources world according third party vetting agencies. Try prove wrong, I'll wait. like Florida said “Just gonna put little graphic right Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia...” Canadians right mad anything Covid related. Try living America pandemic! joking obviously things dark here... could worse. Yes, would rather people ***DIE*** drama queen. /s

For starters, I'm I'm sick first place. flu could kill you, really take precautions. Sorry. I'm going continue wearing mask everywhere help flu colds. people like come sub lot. think happens sub year reached herd immunity? place ghost town gets forgotten years. 

I can't wait! No. live reality. It’s took early tell right now. Ireland proximity United Kingdom New COVID-19 strain got discovered Come man, let us one! fill hearts much love! Yeah right. Things supposedly better, yet tons people know testing positive virus left right. down. Yet, fine last year things worse. Wait how?! I’m used seeing good news sub saw 1.25 million per day thought fucked. Biden taking office won’t magically increase rate vaccination. Plenty absolute professionals working now. total vaccines? US ordered billion far. every supply may need sorted already actual plan gets still full picture fully vaccinated prevents spreading virus. actually think groups, vulnerable essential workers, need vaccinated situation hospitals improve. next milestone 100M start talking getting back normal. macron Nihon

You're ""de,"" ""del"" Mexico City

Tbf, translating ""Cidade México"" could well ""Cidade de **o** México"" apparently portuguese name city adds definite article reason. Emails show Trump realized trying nothing bullshitting didn’t work, subscribed completely baseless idea herd immunity way go, admin took cue. Never mind herd immunity isn’t really possible (there dipshits getting third case COVID) means 13 million/dead year’s time. 

So stay literally anyone else could handle crisis better would lie. According article, [Dr. Anthony 'However, two vitamins Fauci recommend help keep immune system healthy.') takes Vitamin C supplements. getting tested year flu confirmed positive time?

Are immune comprimised? Next summer, probably latest. I'd rather truth freedom make decisions versus ""narrative"" carries guise keeping us safe. sounding alarm months Oh bad Basically, yes. looking quite good! think uphold prediction want vaccine get April? guys think holds going bit optimistic?   wonder data skewed, since kids kept home, especially younger age kids. group hasn’t school, hasn’t in-person play dates, hasn’t exposed ways adults - doesn’t highlight don’t yet know? idea going rely Walgreens CVS pull us insane. need ground school gyms, military administer shots. San Diego zoo.

I miss Harambe :(  even supplies that? I'm still optimistic. want large gatherings virus exist anywhere Earth. Wtf going California Nevada? Holy smokes. comments post *peak* r/Coronavirus comments.
 
*I’m going let child play children 2023 vaccine isn’t ready then! Zoom perfectly fine!*


*if children can’t get vaccine &lt;insert date way past reasonable timeline return continue restrictions keep everything closed get vaccinated* 

I honestly can’t believe eyes. Youyang Gu 7-day rolling average here: real. American Ohio, vaccinating people extremely slowly. Brother got second dose today SIL gets later week. wish could get jab get wait bit longer. Pike Place wet market. certain administration making difficult anymore. needed ignoring lame ducks above. instead prioritizing ~50 million “essential workers”

Its instead. co-priority. old folks essential workers there.

50M essential workers phase first age bracket sound right all, though.

Pretty sure number good bit lower. Lmao, dumb little European salty shithole country handled virus absolutely terrible. much best countries world right? Parents young children (&lt; 16) going form lockdown least July. That’s clinical trials Pfizer concluded FDA month look data approve/deny EUA children.

I’m sure lot families say fuck rely fact Papa, Mama, Grandma vaccinated... know lot families won’t. think got AIDS? 😬 really hard train someone give shots, medical work? trust convicts fight fires make disinfectant, surely average joe shown use syringe everyone needs Heisenberg blue. People still take shwag version it’s what’s offer. Canada relying Chinese vaccine early on, Huawei controversy, China said get fucked. Canada scramble find sources it, one last place orders. Yeah, searched “City Name homeschool co op” Google FB. We’ve moved 3x last 4 years due husband’s career, pretty different experiences state. one co-op last town, twenty current city. religious statement faith, secular (so might take awhile find one that’s right fit family). met weekly classes usually electives. local co-op doesn’t offer anything toddlers/pre-k, could look MOMS/MOPs clubs, too. Yes “study” ends saying basically actual scientific evidence support theory know gonna (I'm young high risk) I'm excited get mine. bet feel invincible haha Judging many articles news report even Healthcare workers refusing vaccine, doubt Please work. want go see family Incorrect 30k combined two days(over NY holiday). number supposed 20k+ creeping much creep sprint sort way since December.
If someone looks Florida numbers right &amp; shrugs off, may want talk someone. Finally American record want see! China' Sinovac Phase1/2 trials children young 3, safety profile seems good, know included Phase 3 (efficacy).

I think likely kids eventually end category pregnant women right now, i.e. get discussion physician, understanding direct evidence well vaccine work benefits outweigh risks. 95% effective 7 days 2nd dose Canada we're barely scraping by. WTF Trudeau? Get ass get fucking vaccine!!! They're going that, unless results 1-dose trial really disappointing. They're second dose 8 weeks first start recruiting late November. FDA's requirement median 2 months data last dose, least April apply results. say covid cured cancer nobody dieing cancer anymore marking everything Covid. 

Oh! news says person died complications covid.... Omg go crazy! ""See! Complications! virus!!""   highest taxes country federal taxes go poor states. don’t get money back way Kentucky (they get + more) enjoy summer. Mark it. TBF still Democrats say Trump president way out. care either. forecasting obvious. Sorry upset. hope better day tomorrow Vitamin supplement multivitamin.

Vitamin deficiency incredibly common, especially winter. wife prescribed it. infant daughter gets well it’s pushed hard health ministry, works.

If going start throwing stuff around studies, accurate. quiet mask holes speak of? I'm saying follow science, that's I'm saying. science says masks still needed kids that's do.

And reasons allergies keep people getting vaccinated. People probably gonna act like terrible news.

A: one vaccine

B: Even takes year vaccinate everyone, even need vaccinate everyone achieve herd immunity, infrastructure continue ramp needs met. 

C: year immunity. I'd happy six months.  Oh, yes.... dropped weekend. Crazy.
Also, testing numbers dropping switching testing vaccinations state run sites.
Don’t 2d. nurse Florida. Loving it. Never made much money life. Lol what?? even care Trump much, care Americans polluting everything internet. say close industries, said kids wear masks vaccine safe that's science says do. entire global population need vaccinated happen. 

Richer nations downgrade first I’m sure upon official global downgrade nations still struggling, - balance - official ruling global downgrade would worthy global celebration. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Edit: lol, conspiracy conservative. misinformation match made heaven. Wish vaccine interesting?

There study showed vaccination prevents infection, people vaccinated show symptoms (in Moderna Pfizer P3 trials, testing symptomatic cases). Israel's largest HMO uses large population vaccinated people show people much less likely turn positive PCR tests 14 days past first shot. 

Note almost protective effect days 0-13. 


This article makes interesting comment: 


""Phase 3 trial data US-based Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, example, gives 95 per cent efficacy rate. However, 44,000 volunteers 3,410 participants displayed Covid-19 symptoms tested, according US Food Drug Administration report. unlikely event participants tested positive, total efficacy rate would drop 30 per cent.

They're contract 100 million US year, whatever that's worth. OWS press briefing.  What's antibody drug? they’ve nice head start. private security 🙏🏻🤞🏻 mean vaccine's real purpose prevent SERIOUS infections? necessarily infection whatsoever?  


I saw another article saying would counted minor infections 2 main MRNA vaccines would 30% effective, 95% effective. would've loved Attenborough made cameo Madagascar special. MIL works Social Security Disability (USA). First application always denied. Second needs doctor verifying validity disability +extensive medical records support claim, even book full occupations (some don’t exist anymore haven’t least decade) pick say “actually, x, y, z”. Never mind fact jobs may exist area, let alone millennia. So. Even *does* get formally recognized society/physicians, doubt it’ll enough get someone classed “officially” disabled regards benefits employment. one biggest reasons never fell “If get get it. probably gonna get anyway” line thinking boss has. Even someone approved, it’s certainly enough live on.  Doctors biologists neither epidomoligists, prescribe medicine clue about, works. friend surgeon denies Covid completely. Im guy clue oracle databases work. fact someone doctor, HCW, doesnt mean anything. still beleive stupid conteos, misinformed. know first hand works, see posting FB vaccine side-effects? GP also covid denier, since coutry lockdown, pandemic september, beleive GP? No, wont.. Covid killed people US since 1918 10x deadlier flu (sources share needed). friends states. 75% population normal def enough see flu Yes better nothing variants indeed reduce effectiveness amount 62% already low would get worse. Starting ~90% like others would much better even possible lowered effectiveness. kinda feel like definitely say ""everyone social distance wear masks"" rather observed two actions could slow viral transmission, suppose subject interpretation.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sounds nice. I've got 40 (spent $90) emergency use (going inside shop doctor's visit) bunch KN95 ones day day use ( grocery pickups)

Something like would really help lot. Wish 'worlds richest country' would this. Smh  think good data that. 

How we? tested for, people got second dose tests. 

There's fuzziness around edges comes short time spans. get positive test 24 days, know means first dose work, doses work? can't even sure contracted it. 

Moreover, seems like people tested exposed, week two ramp-up first dose taking second dose would really, really small. 

I understand good data properly tested. South Africa variant different regular China variant? spike protein? thing makes bit nervous decision start second trial two dose option. makes worry one dose option high effective rate Pfizer/Moderna. saw face read COVID heart still hasn’t started again. virus hits older folks much, much harder younger folks.

Sure, mean best use vaccines give older people. requires various assumptions established.  Report ones following rules, others pickup business. I'm pretty sure total Bloomberg referring first doses.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Using medicine incorrectly answer. want compare Sweden Nordic countries, need thorough comparison looking lockdown vs lockdown. Sweden's strategy differs many ways neighbours, can't really pinpoint *just* matter locking down.

For example, differences could look comparing:

* Strictness measures
* measures enacted
* recommendations communicated
* Demographic differences
* Different levels initial spread

Obviously Nordic countries' responses whole working better, exactly made successful? Thank measured response. Hubris obstacle now. 

Giving gold people read this. widespread scale it'll take long time. done couple million people (but speeding slowly) untested delay booster shot know might affect things. follow Dr. John Campbell youtube, talking bad virus around world (in particular UK) video today shows slight peak hopefully flattening.
He warned US going hitting highs prepare.
I think giving means prepare guarantee don’t take “helmet” calls either. Helmet laws enforced routine police activity. 

Routine police activity doesn’t usually include stakeouts every supermarket. - line read **David Attenborough.**

I bet could hear Pfizer/Moderna released data phase 3 studies? applied EUA, kept calling preliminary data.  can’t speak exactly push 2nd dose, far behind expertise. data show highest level immunity came beyond 7 days 2nd dose, rate around 97.5% according published data. Compared lesser numbers average first dose data conservatively estimates 52.4% immunity. time less shown data data 7 days posts dose 2 shows 90.4% 94.8% = 7 days 2nd dose. healthcare worker? you’ll probably get license vaccine realize theft crime goes times hard Interesting. I'm upvoting hopes get answer. That's kind concerning. basing local reddit sub, boy howdy, promise reflect reality. coworkers least ambivalent restrictions, dislike want end safe. work load gone 30% due short staff company. gotten penny higher asked raise promptly denied. currently searching better job field far going well. 83 million people divided 413 vaccinations centers...

Waiting time, injection, 15 20 minutes observation time...

This difficult arithmetic time management. 

We're long haul. April? Good luck that. vaccines ~95% effective claimed. lower level immunity contracted Covid19 would imply thousands re-infections would occurred.  Confirmed re-infection cases rare always possibly result false negative positive tests. Googling re-infection makes think it’s 95%.  NO. SAID STOP USING NONSENSE TITLES, EQUAL. BETTER ""KNIGHT"" THEREFORE STOP CALLING TITLE ""SIR"". Ban monarchy titles. Thank GOODNESS! man treasure! months immunity achieved. 

Most people circle vaccinated already using excuse party.

Get ducks lined up, preview everything possible, moment's delay getting ""i's"" dotted t's crossed. ready take action immediately. suppose I’ll monitor coming days, yesterday’s experience matched normally get random bugs minor illness every often, I’m inclined believe it’s that.

Thanks. Nah. witchiness protects crap quoting report German language hard copy medical publication, month ago. could always walk. vaccine counted light cases, make sense make comparisons different vaccine efficacy rates unless standards same. Explains previous 78% came from. Eh hope right even though dont technically agree videoing people probably can't consent. Maybe consent? Unless cloth masks already perfect stopping Coronavirus surely make large difference. People don’t seem believe science. blame ones allowed religion decide school policy. Teaching creationism bs like shouldn’t allowed.

Also, lack realistic look back history taught sort propaganda. Essentially whitewashing everything. believe absurd assertion. vein, always forever wear masks incase. saw CNN live updates Covid-19 wrong 🙃!

„Any EU country — including U.K. January 1 — issue emergency authorization, putting medicine market it’s received full authorization, EU countries Cooke stood CMA really get point - especially concerning AstraZeneca vaccine. know vaccine safe efficacy 60%. - reason conditional marketing authorization authorization yet don’t know correct efficacy!

I really don’t think fault EMA like Said politicians. come together granted emergency authorization.

I fact really like process EMA don’t think take much time! 0 effort increase slow pace vaccinations

can explain that? I'm German expert doubt ""dieses britische Virus "" many alternative translations. original data might good enough approval, although 62% effective preventing symptomatic infections, 100% effective preventing hopsitalizations, really important part. would still like see additional data, considering long interval protocol must way behind original, maybe waiting data become solid release it. Good thing one assume won’t site that’s vaccinations Phoenix??? becoming ridiculous, one hand Merkel &amp; Bundestag increasing measures order buy time calling solidarity understanding. 0 effort increase slow pace vaccinations hope Grandma excluded ""catching Covid"" retest despite already foot grave ""asymptomatic"" know. worded wrong, meant vaccines prevent infection. understanding first dose provides immunity second dose extends long immunity lasts second shot part isn’t really true. exclude people exposed covid right before/after first shot immunity first shot goes somewhere around 90% worry. Tomorrow we'll see something new variants impervious everything except kryptonite. And, since Krypton asploded time ago.... Keep rolling eyes, maybe find brain back   California strict good reasons.

People need wear masks responsible.

The hospitals overcrowded. easy try balance safety measures keeping economy alive. countries going new lockdowns speak (they afford price) others using targeted 2 weeks lockdowns (certain cities covid-19 hotspots).  Well possible living mother son pair older 75 See different originally wrote? don’t know general public choice, health worker partner certainly offered choice Moderna Pfizer. ""funny"" people comparing YEARLY flu deaths Covid deaths March/April. Let want shot early volunteer. Heck tutor premed kids can’t get hospital hours that’ll free. think I’d like money back... So... dicks no? I'll take anyone get. even close units. Look around tell think public Western country going sustain 1-2 years. Remember premise won’t even data sometime 2022. could June 2022. you’re telling everybody needs keep year I’d apt get board say that’s possible. Talking anything beyond calendar year...like said, check people already. 
You others get uproar doesn’t change basic societal behavior.  How?
Stay home! covid hotspots cities? New York large density population Canadian cities. live sheds middle woods. Whatever. There’s “source” it’s published anywhere. mine isn’t mention made side effect 2 days. person know still says hands she’d get it’s life threatening anything still. exposed TODAY probably aren’t going die February.

This strictly true all, tons people get hospital within 2 weeks. elections. cool?  Think safe/morally ok plan wedding September? Unfortunately choice good. state tries reopen risk death, California done paying price now. solution federal government help political decision  saw video ABC news tonight. handed masks sneered refusing. sickening. Got first dose today, second 8th, forgot much arm hurts shots haha US 10 times many people. Yeah, 74,000,000 them.... Run essential workers gonna run hospitals anyways? Lot old people the. Essential healthcare workers. Common sense . Besides healthcare workers burned out. least vaccinated feel better continuing work. Israel amazing job. Congrats!  honestly, there's enough nurses give shots right now. entire state 90% capacity. think that. 341 hospitals state 90% capacity.

BUT plan place. I'm EMT. I'm currently getting trained give shots. Paramedics, Firefighters, first responders class. finish 3rd class (I'm 2/3 right now), legally able provide shots. reserved fairgrounds ready us deliver. Well said. It’s ok embrace uncertainty! learn, less realize actually know. fucking embarrassing. stupidity Americans horrifying. Yes part states, I'd say rural communities still benefit points transportation.

If state falls behind, wider pool avenues use get help. many American airports connected Wyoming easy fast travel? many states access get train fleet trucks?

Yes Canada huge population people city, still harder Canadian city pull resources make sure vaccine reaches needs to.

Alberta population spilt mostly two, Edmonton Calgary 300 km apart. That's taxing distribute say Vancouver regions smashed together. reaching communities major city rural areas? British Columbia many tiny spread towns province, would take transport reach Vancouver. fact Calgary edmonton best places hit communities.  Cries brazilian 😕 post thing.

That's least seeing it. Time sacrifice goat  Thanks man. morning kind anxiety attack, thinking possibly able see dad summer (he lives europe mom). Thank god videogames. Booted spiderman ps4 quickly got mind it. 

I can't even imagine folks suffer chronic depression must feel. hope I'll able keep positive mindset summer imagine organized leadership. used given US. longer. understand possible. India population 1.3 billion vs LA county's 10 million. lack testing India? India stricter restrictions? Something add me. gave away commemorative pin, could get every 20something OC vaccinated within week interesting fact. happen Neanderthal me. Perhaps long lost relatives. Stranger things happened. all, got lucky met wife dating site 23andme.com. never know crazy world live in! Canada US two completely different situations completely different health care systems deal with. thought maybe body ketoacidosis burning fat

The word looking ketosis. Ketoacidosis serious diabetic complication. Many people consider Christians people faith, true. church man-made institution sacraments sake, God's (he need them). Christians we're called sacrifice service love humility. real sacrifice. regardless, sacrament taken real risk people's lives counterproductive best actively harmful worst.

The belief building geographical place sacred following God's law heretical. sympathize feel way, deceived. take pictures staff customers wearing masks put social media send police. corporate like story getting fine. Except..... I’m scared. COVID November. fucked bad healthy 38 year old, made even determined help vulnerable neighbors get it. antibodies now. I’m afraid. 


Your false equivalency analogy fails one way really need get head around, friend - car crashes highly contagious don’t threaten exponentially overwhelm entire medical system. I'd never gotten flu shot season. Probably always get one, know them. you’re weighing risk vaccine developmental harm vs risk virus. less risky virus, difficult becomes justify giving untested vaccine children. read LA Times article LAUSD's superintendent statement, headline completely false. says \*WHEN AVAILABLE KIDS\* required, precondition returning. Like literally says opposite article lol. need call name.  confusing adenovirus vaccine, vaccine *against* adenovirus (and around decades) vaccine uses adenovirus vector, new. absolutely chance hang wait 2-shot results unless 1-shot disappointment. 1-shot anywhere north 80% that’s absolute home run. Around 75% think would socially acceptable. Less 70% would big let down.

A lot plan banking single shot option. That’s 50 crowd gets. especially winter.

Even year people going less. Thinking strong point. 

The way generally achieve higher wireless speeds increasing band channels involved. means power spread wider range frequencies, making power given frequency lower. would reduce already negligible effect wireless signals person.

But can't comprehend make things up.  Thanks link. agree couple assumptions due inability extrapolate many people actually immunity due infection long time period, unlikelihood half number needed herd immunity result immunity prior infection. safer assumption cover half population vaccinations assume prior infection provide difference needed herd immunity make future spread difficult, take little longer achieve currently projected doses. two sources seen results"" **could be** two informants anti-China sentiment scientifically trained picked &lt;60% statistic somewhere thick report.

bye bye whataboutism embarrassing article.

The original news source, Syracuse.com, points outbreak part large post-Thanksgiving wave throughout county (almost none receiving vaccine early). Nursing home residents started vaccinated 12/22, may take two weeks (partial) competent antibody response. Residents started dying 12/29, meaning already gotten infected COVID-19 time earlier, vaccine protection kicked in.

But somehow ""ronpaulinstitute.org"" website managed spin anti-vax story. Ron Paul medical doctor? sad people know better disregard good science favor biased politics. debate states. arguing can't isolate state locked state take care them. Smh one asking hide. Anecdotal findings studies.

Provide real source else passing along misinformation. Maybe stop shooting workers then. means cost benefit analysis testing children leans favor cause nearly dangerous them. worst jobs America without pandemic going on. Govt oversight totally castrated. no, get wait last SF mask compliance high (as in, count two hands number people I’ve seen without mask since March). I’m sure something it. :) probably pretty good idea now. Kids exposed society too. hear Zoom classes every weekend kids saying they’re gong grandparents house, cousins, birthday party, etc. I’m anti-mask land anything either. sent large supply Dakotas that’s pandemic bad last month. it’s bad California don’t supply need. pissed right now? used love reading www.thedailywtf.com stories people fucking up. Stopped mostly lack time nowadays, still great site... sound really jazzed really seem know talking  Corona easy avoid. getting something wrong. bought $400 grow light.Roughly $420 shipped door 2 days. saw YouTube’s TheHockeyGuy pay $150 duties get Tampa Bay retro jersey shipped Vancouver. impressive, don’t know many taken two separate occasions, means rate they’ll herd immunity within year. British news buy from? It’s absolutely dumb countries aren’t accepting countries approvals. England says Oxford safe trust them. boo hoo mayor man California administered 35% vaccines hand. entire rollout bungled. Denmark currently 123%, need doses haha Awtch! logic might well get used life pretty much nobody thinks covid going disappear. going risk. 
Just lighting match everything mid 2022...2023....that’s happening. People suggest aren’t living reality. Lol I? Never noticed. Thanks diagnosing doc tradition absolute awful job get vaccine cus USA Well stand corrected. actually got figure site... probably misread. 

Canada UK well covered. wants take shortcut God. matters millions get infected day. Every day matters. Hell every hour make difference, put arms fast possible. There's chance might see day COVID deaths April 8th (the previous highest), depending deaths start plateau.

Highest since April currently 6th 7th January, 799 deaths reported far: Majorly. want get back world life avoiding virus. UK: welcome. Let’s pretend vaccines don’t stop transmission all. something like 80% vaccinated. You’re dreaming think 80% people calling life staying indoors indefinitely. 

Another faulty premise: everybody social distancing already. almost zero distancing. masks place sure going stores public 2019 addition masks. discussions start assumption people isolating. agree think showing blip downward trend daily cases. Protect man costs!!! honestly cannot watch nature documentary anymore unless he’s narrator! agree! one focused lot since mutations occur spike protien. Also, possible longer incubation period HUGE problem. saw ""sir David Attenborough"" panicked  Maybe not, people commenting news story total doomsday look it, sees total failure. Eh, nice information come from. anyone country fault everyone calls ""Japanese"" strain everyone reads story mindful encounter someone traveling Japan. Pirates Caribbean! (Ok I'm old.) Someone sub said many young healthy people non-priority groups certain cities (you probably know ones I'm talking about) convinced coronavirus poses major threat *them*, rather mostly elderly people comorbidities, businesses lobby mask mandates summer maybe fall use cover think actually *good business* cautious young people. sounds like weird theory can't relate idea *young healthy people* fearing *getting sick virus* rather *spreading people risk*. way messaging pandemic inextricably moralized, can't rule out.  No, discriminate age. force young people perfectly willing run numbers imprisonment carry costs generations future. sick society. sooner gets put sooner go back Movies! Healthcare Canada provincial responsibility provinces different strategies. provinces near zero approach fared much better although easier control entry points (Atlantic Canada territories). I'm Newfoundland Labrador continue well. can't lump Canadian provinces together really although yes better nationally. Yup. Azar gave states two weeks prep, puts execution new administration timeframe.

We'll see plays say otherwise. UK vaccinated people per capita US... There’s two strategies pandemic. 1. Reduce deaths 2. Reduce transmission long run saves lives.

There’s absolutely good argument prioritizing older adults highest risk. there’s also good argument prioritizing group interaction public. Fairly sure that's /u/Roltondr wants do, nobody stop them. good news sense. risk group gets vaccine, maybe Sweden safe space already. rate anyone 40 wait June July. think wait long. however far better nothing, moment nothing alternative people. help short term stop people dying, certainly good thing. Yes A1C 7.3 December 2019. Dr. said time start taking sugar pills. said changed diet exercise regimen. March A1C 5.0 yea could ketosis understand ketoscidosis even flu Covid. got flu shot October 2019. 2 weeks February ached struggled even breath get bed. think stomach microbiome changing one kill one immune boosting life enhancing. yes wondering. place gives Covid antibody test blood bank donating blood cannot give blood Hodgkin lymphoma twice.  end March enough vaccine 6 million inhabitants

really? joke ""Truly, magnificent"" Gel? reddit usually go three levels reply vaccination thread  moron brings Tuskegee study - 

a) nothing vaccines and
b) shows old tired vaccine deniers arguments are.

Congratulations! todays winner! ANYONE CHECKED BETTY? WHERES BETTY?! remember whatever new plans announced CDC likely last week most. virus thing discriminating age limited amount vaccines.

Everyone hurting right now. young people. Maybe found new evidence something, know hospitals reused shortage. asked scientific source CDC ""normal people"" reuse FFP2, masks nobody still able provide it. Sry, deleted comment. U right. 91 million cases could realistic lower end IMO.  Thanks, but, honestly... world better place without us. wonder people forced live shitholes throughout history ever felt like this. people actually liked Trump here, taught maybe could finally bring gov even meant people would go them. 

Well, I'm 27 youth escaped never gonna change. So, I've stopped caring. bought enough vaccines isn’t relevant context. go guess. humankind danger becoming extinct, small minority people could saved, I'd hope could make list. Oh man post nearly gave mini heart attack show got data shows million vaccines yesterday? care enough google wanted “that guy”. 

Don’t guy. New Lepers. Calling now, cursed comment Ok. Consider this. Every year 9 million people die year starvation. ten years 90 million people. Mostly young middle-aged deaths. Covid victims average age 82 years. Nobody makes big deal starvation deaths. Yes, moment people ""Oh now, horrible"". it. media coverage, nothing. Every year, people starve death.

Every year 400 thousand people USA die wrong medical treatment. ten years 4 million. Nobody cares. covid deaths disproportionately made biggest, darkest misery, everybody fear-shock-empathy train. ignoring 70 million tragic deaths happen year. lot preventable. deaths tragic, make covid tragic all, considering deaths people last year even months. Orange Orfice volunteer deaths hospitalizations go significant degree states going start opening up. Imagine mad Sir David Attenborough include asymptomatic cases, neither Moderna Pfizer included asymptomatic cases results reporting 95% efficacy, understand even reported like is.

Only recently Moderna released data suggesting 2/3 decrease asymptomatic transmission, obviously much less 95% well.

Isn't extremely misleading? Love sensational headlines. claim originally staked reasonable skeptical COVID vaccines humans rushed two pandemic vaccines market before, times debacle. 

Later mentioned Gardasil research (such is) example might want trust public health officials they're trying push new vaccine. 

Then incorrectly accused cherry picking changed subject. appear trying make discussion great vaccines are, that's strawman itself, furthermore undermine initial claim. 

Just curiosity, think infection fatality rate COVID is? Seems like it, 50% anywhere near enough induce herd immunity, virus still spreading, still ideal (for one, lot people can't vaccinated medical reasons) get 4% number?

Even that’s true, 4% 4% many. 

Why fair out-of-state out-of-country people take Florida’s allocated share?  doubt justify “it can’t hurt careful” approach, that’s route leaders end going. hurt, kills economy destroys businesses livelihoods. stalling economy isn’t best interest leaders rely popular vote reelection, well, guess except greasy orange type want watch world burn. vaccine really 100% effective severe covid good enough opinion. Certainly better candidates world facing limited deliveries, need help get!  that's good news. man institution. Well would vaccine. end March enough vaccine 6 million inhabitants Pfizer Moderna. 
If Astrazeneca approved maybe bit more. J &amp;J 2nd quarter 2021 available. 
The numbers EU-Members pretty similar , relative population. Agree current lockdown LA basically choose adventure. edited post accordingly. Thank bringing attention. article freezers all; that's US thing. Canada debating copying UK delaying second dose beyond day 21.   So, counts good vaccine. might experience equivalent cold get covid-19 immunized, that's it? throw waning immunity first dose

The first dose induces larger immune response body natural course infection. worried waning causing resistant strain, first look already positive people, vaccinated people. “Quote, unquote” phrase you’re looking for. yes. “Natural” habitat. Fuck zoos. DeathSentence earned nickname pattern behavior. taking coronavirus outbreak seriously. lockdowns, mask mandates. manipulates Florida Public Health data make numbers look ""better"". 

I defend Newsom vaccines sitting freezers, either. resorting whataboutism weak. heartbroken. may myocarditis, really strong heart ""hurt"". Without data tests one know. Bavaria going use masks made Delft. Besides, developed Delft also need sterilized, research RIVM shows. practical average citizen. Recruiting volunteers earlier would increased risk ADE slipping trials.

Performing challenge trials would let know ADE issue dosed tens thousands people begin with. much dark? Mayo COVID-19 symptoms sometimes persist months. virus damage lungs, heart brain, increases risk long-term health know this? Please show where. don’t think theres evidence shows one dose moderna vaccine reduces risk death severe illness past 28 days. think mistook argument -- one ARGUING change schedule. They're arguing hit worst-case scenario here, vaccine manufacturing ends significantly disrupted, data indicate we'll still really, really good protection.

So, best case scenario -- roll lot faster. Worst case scenario, still end people good protection.

Of course caveats -- damned worst case scenario. scenario, basically end significantly curtailing stopping vaccination. Oh, well sort thing still happen, obviously high rate. would type UK driving test, includes check new drivers adequate vision, done whilst standing pavement. passing driving test another law guy decided never needed do.  Regardless population size, Canada resources fix problem, well several models follow (which people mention Finland) 

Just tax, doesn’t mean money properly allocated directly target fundamental problems cause sustain homelessness. 

Decriminalizing drugs, therapy, affordable/subsidized housing, free post secondary education, free childcare, accessible resources... issues plus various socio-economic factors. 

It seems, general, Canada focuses punishing homeless instead rehabilitation Finland people mention it! 

Montreal fining homeless people past curfew. supposed go? Clearly huge amount prejudice towards homeless needs addressed. People say “oh need homeless shelters! neighbourhood...” 

For example, mom helped homeless lady back feet insurance agency wouldn’t pay her, resulting lengthy legal battle losing apartment living streets, 60 years old. live NJ feel headed path. We're really things need keep getting hand. Governor seems interested reelection comments news posts basically ""Derh hurh flu deaths"" like people want get hand. Agree, be, 70 - 80, 80 - 90, 90+ something like that. getting downvoted oblivion saying florida right thing start 65+. Essential worker bs idiotic. Every single article, survey, study calls anything weeks ""long covid"". 

Define ""few"". case considered same, medically, 90 year old debilitating cough 10 months. 

Doctors quite stupid think are. There's magical cutoff COVID long COVID. two different diseases. single disease potential last long time. There's sudden, abrupt change care prognosis anything wake cough day 29. old people nursing homes, plenty still go grocery shopping, eating, etc. vaccinate every grocery worker, etc would doses required vaccinating old people directly. Life one big game, put another quarter fun playing it. There's never perfect answer. That's thing seems missing discussions. purely cold numbers game. better chance people alive next year celebrate family. No, work way everyone. things life, go better odds. use UV sanitizer recycle masks. look smell good new. Typically wear 20 times throwing away. Beats surgical cloth masks day Yeah I’m acknowledging that. referring moderna now? first fuggin one Yup. this. used work 5 days week office. go 1 2 days, weeks even 0. I'm perfectly able job home. Myocarditis present muscle weakness though right? heart hurting, feeling tired, dizzy. still able walk 90 mins without much difficulty? One thing certain, people press talk much B117 little variant B.1.351 absolutely causation broadest sense immune response literally everything trash vitamin deficient. 

I'm saying Vitamin magic covid treatment/cure/protection. I'm saying already plenty scientific consensus notion vitamin deficiency bad you. Hence entire premise classed vitamin RDA that.

i'm trying COVID sage. i'm saying already well documented reason differences progression nyc march florida august, occam's razor suggests mutation much business usual. deficient macro- micro-nutrients. exactly opposite paper saying. specifically indicates individuals neutralizing antibodies still got re-infected. obviously saying ""pretend problems away"" lol, trying positive. I’m work you. Either educate don’t. no. absolutely deadly elderly. thing dislike don’t people like fauci calling shit out. critical places following science locking he’s really tempered criticizes blatantly unscientific restrictions

The said different countries register covid deaths weird covid deaths statistics.

PCR tests 35 cycles seem indicate people might sick. indicator somewhat messed tracking covid spread.

What trying say is, data somewhat imperfect. Regarding IFR, know 1 - 1,5%, 0,1 - 0,2% (max 0,5%). Thats people vote. jest, also serious. People vote damage good sometimes. RemindMe! 30 days goober thinks want acknowledged sad millennials ""survived virus"" need validation special treatment.

Fauci needs straight come say kids even remotly risk covid injury death. things like reinfection child risk ludicrously low metrics, shouldn’t people publically explaining disease talking “it’s rare.” 

When reinfection rate lower disease consider provide immunity, shouldn’t talking extremely rare things can’t even claim causation

It’s frustrating top epidemiologists understanding impact media case studies spread fear:

It’s causing people trust real science

It’s causing way mental health damage pandemic fatigue 

It’s harmful scientific process can’t say “reinfections concern without data” Brahhh discovered word hasn’t used since 1926 I’m taking dab CDC data No, let tell why

Places like Florida already opened max (no masks, dine wherever) bet ass cases begin dropping spring sizeable portion population vaccinated restrictions begin go one one. governors decide prolong pandemic (for whatever reason?) people protest something, would probably join 4% Florida's doses gone state folks. Sure agree bad think. You’d come Florida that.  Agreed, they'll move goalposts (as already trial-ballooning) ""deaths"" ""cases,"" normal left mere ""semblance."" endless parade caveats makes lose hope we're ever getting this. Everyone going get two doses. Imagine go buy box poptarts. Now, everyone buys box poptarts, now, Walmart must hold box Poptarts freezer when/if decide come back 21 days next box Poptarts. 

You've taken simple task buying two boxes Poptarts Kelloggs manufactures every single day made extremely onerous, wasteful, logistical nightmare. reason distribute vaccines like this. 

Yes, going get two doses vaccine. may receive according schedule, new supply. going 'hold' shot freezer 21days many desperate need vaccine now. 

This literally every vaccine supply chain around world set up. proven work. guy broke rules exercising Stratford telling try harder? yer bike mate. Germany’s debt GDP ratio, despite lockdown programs, 70%. There’s plenty money coffers left, long last time need put together benefits scheme. I’m worried financial perspective.
 
The real challenge social mental impacts. Myself, I’m quite introverted person without family (live flatmate who’s good friend mine) lockdown problem. millions families young kids, single people independent age, continue struggle, get worse lockdown extends. decision would like take Merkel’s shoes, leader matter. I’d pay 20 grand vaccine right now, could feel comfortable spending time new granddaughter. won’t happen. certain point (probably summer) restrictions mask mandates become politically unpopular. vaccine widely available months everyone chance get it, people want wear mask anymore. don’t think day governors come say “the mask mandate today,” it’ll slowly phase become irrelevant. [This absolutely true even basis saying scientific. attempt asinine backed Vaccinating health care workers first less risk dying, keeping many work force possible. already huge shortage nurses pandemic, need every single one working right now. 

IMO healthcare workers elderly vaccinated time, say nurse got second dose Pfizer. Usually end day vaccine clinic, staff would start taking ""walk ins"" frontline employee wanted one, otherwise going thrown out. reason taken elderly patients community given doses. Cool Well, stupid comment implying America blame concept that's existed since beginning humanity. Who'd win fight: British coronavirus South African? sell Pharmacies Germany. also sold online. People 60 already receiving free masks Government. incorrect. announcement today federal government stop holding back second doses. Jake LaTurner also decided get results going vote (was positive),but appears secure room 0.02 reinfection rate matches Qatar study 0.01.

Actually waiting complete rollover Oxford-Astrazeneca: effective, less costy driving crazy due cold chain delivery. say hit risk groups age ranges point. actually pretty early group. heard chatter students relatively early, sure that’s true tho.  Tbf Denmark bad. They've vaccinated 2% population less 1% US vaccinated 2.8% yesterday. rest EU definitely need move on. Although approving Oxford end month hopefully speed things along  nation-states endured strict rationing, bans certain consumer goods, forced evacuations, steady diet patriotic propoganda?  fighting totalitarianism.  people equate public health effort concomitant efforts educate ameliorate economic damage totalitarianism, whilst ignoring personality cult. Incredible.

There public support asked something, trust telling degree, believe reasoning arbitrary, well founded.

 
Nothing UK done demonstrated that. bad governance. response right proves everything friend, cheers Anyway... Reinfection rate 0.02 study close Qatar study 0.01. intentional ostriching every political level. outbreak occurred prior national holiday town gathering many infected sharing buffet style meals. Shutting city huge economic political decision. shutting city, infection spread became world-wide pandemic. shame, really.

Right now, hospitals States converted much reasonably ICUs treating COVID patients, patient volume still eclipsing hospitals. without 117B. is, words. want starve. want die preventible diseases. want kids happy school. want die pothole. there's evidence vaccines provide sterilizing immunity, even vaccine could still catch covid pass friends could pass others. know got it, body fight without developing symptoms. difference pretty much insignificant surgical masks filter exhaled air around 95% efficiency. 

The main difference FFP2 protecting wearers, handle care pretty much useless (FFP2s also ineffective stubble facial hair prevent tight, sealed fit). 

IMO decision really add lot protecting people. I've followed precautions point. go stores, see friends virtually distance, I've put non-urgent appointments. I'm vaccinated, I'm going let precautions dine outside, get together small group, go shopping masked. throw caution window, I'm going start living life extent. first time Americans taken smug sense national superiority work German scientists.

That’s county charge distribute. county populated county (Hillsborough) call make appointment. currently appointments, there’s also waiting line hours.  Thank god didn’t anything stupid like ignore medical advice let 3.5million school children 500k school staff mingle day calling lockdown...

Fucking imbeciles.  question though circulating Italy early September March things started get bad terms hospitalisations/deaths? initially low number cases took spread I'm getting worried able get second shot. I'm worried they're going giving everyone one shot massive wait second one despite fact already appointment. Maybe, trust many people involved (even took part testing vaccinated already), impossible nothing leaked. dont believe conspiracy theories. may unpopular opinion, especially since launched little rocky holidays....I think going outdo vaccination goals. start see things turning already big cities opening huge vaccination sites, states figuring need get many people possible, J&amp;J approval horizon. could fast forward month take look sub going pretty positive place. Literally hardship caused lockdowns can't go buy cheeseburgers. listen talk people becoming impoverished can't work put food table, that's propaganda.  German BaUa explains quite good: difficult educate people, never need use mask life. People worked Labs knows well.

Decriminalizing prostitution address myriad issues sex worker encounters one's life including: lack opportunity, education, poverty, physical/sexual/emotional abuse (in early childhood well adulthood), gangs, drugs/addiction, familial resources, language, police encounters. Like forms social problems (crime exploitation, necessarily prostitution itself), constellation structural (inter)personal breakdowns would seemingly manage coherent response *all* concerns.

We see model gets applied rather inadequately drug addiction people returning society prison tend focus one issue without understanding fit together. example, advocacy groups arguing stable housing (without similar focus jobs) current California push educate prisoners behind bars formal post-secondary education (a position wholeheartedly support; contract state various local county agencies develop direct college education programs incarcerated people) without sufficient support other, critical life areas. contrast examples, excellent pilot programs demonstrated efficacy *multi-systemic therapy* (one could google 'MST' curious discussion) regards juvenile offender programs developed formal programs various communities.

The way prostitution framed academic perspectives professional sex workers tends silences minority voices implies representative broad consensus regarding sex workers understood left alone--a consensus exist practice. exists certain perspectives would prefer prioritize certain aspects employment, unionizing health care, detriment factors, as, human trafficking child exploitation. usual dance involves rather superficial slicing population ""sex workers"" vs. ""human trafficked victims."" is, argument made *this* consensual women *that* victims two wholly separate. practice, much distance two and, wrote earlier, extremely truncated understanding issues confronting woman *chooses* sex work occupation. Given concerns laid earlier, arguable woman sex worker made consensual choice all. respect, find academic perspectives would find sex work *can't* consensual (some radical feminists might hold view, example; separately, advocated position). find surprising all, limited sex worker debates, loudest voices often white females. Missing everything I've written, hopefully notice, discussions *male* sex workers varying sexual orientations. They're left conversation voices driving discussion. also specifically discussed trans sex workers, trans non-sex workers abused treated like sex workers, list disenfranchised groups (from society, legal protection, various advocacy groups) still remains inadequate.

Part issue, opinion, illustrated via one historical example: fight women's rights form family leave. Western European countries conversation focused primarily around rights families raise children. I'm distilling barest bones, end result find today: women men much egalitarian roles household terms childcare workplace rights protect ability parents take time family's needs. Contrast US system ""rights"" barely protect woman childbirth say nothing weeks afterwards. FMLA ""protects"" discrimination surface, types realities working mother encounters leaves broad latitude effectively discriminate women ways men experience. corollary men enjoy protections women--even limited protection rights might provide. tend find end result women find working ""second shift"" primary care givers, taking work families, men barely given consideration claim stay home husband...even country still continues resistance understanding *women* caregivers hard workers. believe conversation national level Michelle Obama discussing role women family workplace rather precarious balancing act requires--that conversation still ongoing.

We also draw rough analogies war drugs evolved medical argument general decriminalization position. states recently went 100% across line last election, even states illicit drug use gone away certain people victimized others. dangers I'm trying point easy take one perspective, even loudest room, representative stakeholders involved.

My apologies...I think may raised many questions tried answer! direct answer question multi-systemic breakdowns beg multi-systemic responses. Simply decriminalizing prostitution solve problems surrounding sex work (reframing prostitution ""sex work"" political process specific intent end-goal mind) may exacerbate certain victims. know yet studies run 2 years find out. Elderly living home still high risk.

I'm nurse manager, currently 4 nurses work due vaccine side effects. got weekend. larger staff shortage now, we've throughout pandemic. Ironic .. Vasovagal syncope

i.e. [fainting/light headedness getting Israel running tight race cases exploding vaccinations exploding. going difficult shift that, fully expect need another lockdown summer.

If things done right, spread could contained seasonality kicks (hoping UK variant also sensitive) meanwhile vaccinate like madmen next fall herd immunity, normality already summer.

If done wrong, reopen early, need additional lockdown (or more) everybody behaves like idiot grandpa's immune still manage saturate ER middle age people... CHAT ZOOM possible everyone.

On complete side that, working front green screen (in one bedroom flat, work live alone in.) 

It's total hoot. get control exactly folks see Teams calls like. Suck kids.. got another year least this. Dude, made day!!! scrape 1,000,000 doses one day, rocketed past quite handily.

We honestly know that, though. way states report, *might* million doses ""today"". might've last Friday. might days. 

Obviously numbers going faster good regardless, really know many vaccinations day we're at. mate fist lockdown completely crushed virus carried bit longer brought border checks quarantine mess. Vaccines great they're going silver bullet think sort borders definitely not. Sunday “rECord” 200kish im correct.. government absolutely nailed vaccine roll - comparable country world.

The flip side states like NY NJ got totally hammered massive populations. NJ 223.5 deaths per 100k population 8.9 million (between Virginia Belgium) definitely way worse Belgium's 174.

Spottet German one 95% invincible Really smart - Sputnik vaccine gets lot grief here, incorrectly opinion. point mental health financial wellbeing population (and government) outweigh dangers virus itself?

If correct we're talking essentially full lockdown November April. crazy mentally cope last year.   Meanwhile Canada, provincial leaders taking vacations, giving weekends blaming federal government inability fucking jobs. Good thing got 50 per mail. 

It's gonna make big difference tho. Who's gonna enforce this?  
I still see plenty people masks noses, nose wires adjusted, masks way big on. people stupid wear surgical mask correctly, let alone FFP2. Hey now, town's virus better town's virus! think poster referring CBRN masks lawmaker chamber, got siege protestors (you could see lawmakers wearing them, example 

I'm sure representatives got out, brought them, happened that, think that's poster referring to. Why?  Thank god vaccinations! first thought cases freaked out! Dafuq😕 statement. Every article I've read refused mention talking global perspective. problem many African countries may even start vaccinations year, yes. However, highly doubt anyone countries reading CNN specifically imply social distancing needed 2022. seems dishonest me. scammers Detroit steal tax ID claim huge tax refund, called IRS attempted straighten things out, said they’d send verification paperwork, months pass, paper work. call lean sent verification paperwork SCAMMERS ADDRESS! Even been, takes two doses several weeks fully protected. everything conspiracy seems like biggest issue far ‘last mile’ needles arms, vaccines hospitals. There's evidence death caused vaccine. Sometimes people die number people getting vaccine bound people die shortly getting completely unrelated causes. Anyone like watching needles go in? Anyone? popular fetish I've missed? 20 'shots' shots every time talk vaccine news? Seriously? Ah, yeah, provides lot context one missing. What, don’t violently inhale fist fist bump? 

Jk wouldn’t want either. results bad we'd already know it. social media age, someone sure got vaccine wound hospital would place. places. South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, etc... still solid grip virus.

This idea control false. said, takes swift acting gov't diligent population curb stomp nasty little sucker. Many western countries lack least one qualities. countries like US setup fail due way government response structured. Wow glad people thought putting reality tv star charge good idea 

He anything right get vaccine busy whining Twitter actually lead? mean U.S. armed insurrection less year limited half-assed lockdowns imaginary claims voter fraud.

There would much larger armed insurrection American authorities tried impose China-style lockdowns contain virus. CCP tactics compatible American culture. Yeah we'll see 👍 know you’re joking general shame disrespect awful ways dealing people misinformed. Shame tactics debatable value used people *know* they’re wrong. People denying Covid skeptical vaccine/masks genuinely think they’re right, though. 

I’ve said million times it’s like shouting brick wall. Treating people like they’re children, stupid, etc. leads self fulfilling prophecy become likely refuse safe practices. It’s frustrating they’re putting peoples lives risk effectively killing people, agree. treating dignity trying open, rational dialogues much greater chance (even it’s still minuscule) changing people’s opinions hatred shame. rapidly infecting large regions lung, virus causing Covid-19 sets shop multiple small areas lung. hijacks lungs’ immune cells uses spread across lung period many days even weeks, like multiple wildfires spreading across forest. infection slowly moves across lung, leaves damage wake continuously fuels fever, low blood pressure damage kidneys, brain, heart organs patients Covid-19. get Gavin Newsom team office? literally full year plan still trying figure out. crazy. hear things like, “LA Authorizes 500.000 health care workers vaccinated end month!!!” want puke. millions doses sitting shelf!!! done prior Christmas. Absolutely . don’t religious like level faith pharmaceutical companies, problem don’t understand things work

If recall , (or ancestors effected by) 40 year long Tuskingee syphilis “study” . Well , you’re ridiculous 70s long time ago government stopped condoning bad things ... well Studies shown 10% people vulnerable reinfection around 90 days initial infection. think 10 reinfection cases greatly underestimated. it’s fair say reinfection isn’t HUGE concern comes herd immunity. even close. DeSantis posting seniors getting months. imagine 18 months ago even positing idea would reuse masks, n95 otherwise; would laughed hospital detail different article:

[Trump administration reverses stance, longer hold back second shots coronavirus vaccine - Washington Trump administration announce sweeping changes vaccination rollout Tuesday, ***including making many doses the*** ***vaccine available*** urging states provide shots anyone 65 older. steps effort speed [delayed disjointed  changes sharp departure administration’s previous strategy, come days [President-elect Joe Biden announced release nearly vaccine supply.

I think move made sooner (at least scaling 55% lower percentage) I'm happy come regardless made final call. Advocating while. Using completely wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

well done. 18 different mutations one person, 5 months. 
I'm assuming treated hospital, leave due poor health, constantly exposed new mutations due wards kept in. Raising questions hospital hygine? Ah, see confused.

When threat gas (non-lethal otherwise) came up, members congress donned military grade gas masks. masks understandably desks occasion. picture putting mask on. Wearing gas mask give 100% invulnerability tear gas...and sarin...and vx...and COVID.

In seriousness, I’m done mocking. It’s like N95 something. wearing best protection money buy. either swapped didn’t get COVID room. It’s highly likely took off. Gas masks hard breath terribly uncomfortable...but you’ve got one you’re believe high risk situation, you’d idiot take off. thing staffing.


My partner works “vaccine team” they’re extremely understaffed actually physically give vaccines. people give shots move fast. 😔 Yeah, need learn read graphs.

In December 41% said would definitely, another 30% said probably. That's 71%. statement? Upvoted truth. Rep. Jayapal [tested spending hours room Republican Lawmakers refused wear masks, even sneered offer free mask, Capitol riots. understandably pissed. depends organization. work large bank even pandemic already strong WFH infrastructure offices leaning toward ""flex-desk"" systems desks assigned everyone always going in. things got bad problem say everyone's WFH indefinitely (and they're waiting things truly back normal attempt large scale use offices, jumping go back cases went bit like summer). expect people back office time things normal, much liberal use WFH teams used remote year.

On hand organizations going see natural order things people office, never flexibility consider anything else. matters lot may want try move another company sees way you. people insane. Link please? curve interesting watch People absolutely nuts. could see mirror image another country would shaking heads. Yet think rational.  Bag. LOL didn’t proofread voice dictation enough It’s unbelievable getting downvoted sharing emotional state. place brigaded shills selfish people it’s hard watch. 


It scary. I’m scared too. Anyone common sense (who isn’t denial coping mechanism) scared. They're still lunch break west coast. Plenty vaccinations happening today. to. saying believe anything specific it. saying good reason trust people telling ok. plenty legit reasons bit skeptical.

Like head OWS found loophole divest millions stocks vaccine companies. still hasn’t divulged potential conflicts interest. appointed administration known cronyism putting profit political gains ahead public comes saying ignore protocol get first dose Moderna many arms possible fast possible, think: hmm, wonder could stand gain personally this, best interest his? conflict interest, never able know sure.

Then could say, well, public health officials would certainly catch medical risk it. Sure, maybe, trust keep reservations fear may stoke vaccine hesitancy? seen Fauci defenders say white lies greater good. may been. raise problems road trust.

Then perfectly reasonable respected mainstream scientists legitimately baffled industry isn’t studying vitamin thing more. (It isn’t profitable, extremely cheap) started fringe rumors, isn’t fringe anymore. Haha yep, even read twice way REALLY analysed Focus treatments countermeasures. 
But everyone wants magic answer wind clock back 2019. 
It might work out, doubt it. Covid barely infected anyone yet, 50-60% people infected virus experience increasing pressure overcome immunity. 
Same vaccination. creates evolutionary pressure virus adapt. unknown, better cautious side. 

Think insurance. think i'm going die next years can't sure life insurance policy. 

The risk wearing mask needing much smaller wearing mask needing it. bubble up, bois non resident get booster? assume travel back it?

The entire distribution process broken. done correctly, would lot people (fairly) vaccinated.
Instead mob seems control restaurant taking necessary precautions minimize COVID-19 spread, nothing worry about. disprove fact children likely die pretty much airborne disease vaccinated for.

Sadly, fact die children color highlights real issue healthcare accessibility minorities US. find majority child obesity diabetes cases also minority children. Oh yeah, misunderstood. Thanks help! mean, I've received vaccines, I'll continue wearing mask majority people want vaccine gotten vaccine 2 reasons. First, public places mandate masks everybody opportunity get vaccine. Second, theoretically possible still transmit virus. think possibility still transmit virus low, I'll play safe we're closer herd immunity vaccination. I've sure already loosened bit distancing.  People axe grind always lie reviews. restaurants following COVID-19 rules could avoid fallout following them. AstraZeneca applied approval today reviewed January 29th... Hamburglar aint fucking around! Thanks, must lost track. I'd give mine could. test HCQ+Azithromycin+Vitamin D+Vitamin C+Zinc+HIV Meds+Ivermectin+Remdesivir+Steroids? /s

People still arguing HCQ miracle cure stupid fking COVID deniers point. Haha thanks diahorrea dose one Pfizer, vaccine, spot diahorrea v-safe, American CDC monitoring website. second dose many people fever, aches, fatigue. That's immune system working. want whatever guy wearing head. article gives much better picture people going through. They're trapped sea almost described form indentured servitude. illegal. federal guidelines CDC put out, they're that. people lie vaccine rate? article admits 1.25 3 days. negative, see writing wall. Even start general public end June, think able vaccinate 200 million 3 months? would require 4 million per day, something even close reaching.. realism even granting 2 million per day end fall general public get it, different acting like beginning summer everyone wants it.

Anytime someone directs red-hat nonsense way , blast away.
Can’t argue/ reason people. combination new variant immunologically naive population. better worse, places like UK US substantial immunity, slowing spread bit, enough Fall/Winter wave overwhelmed hospitals anywhere already substantial outbreak. Neil Ferguson (author ICL paper spurred Trump/Boris action) talked bit. Probably, strain takes US, seeing waves like simply baseline immunity slow spread somewhat. somewhat worse version already have. reality wishing death upon someone preferable appreciating good news? name ... call failure Corona Mary Names

Doug LaMalfa Yeah agree. tend see extremes here. Certain people make seem like it’s impossible others make seem like happens time.  Thank god competent American leadership coming in, disregarding idiots among us could become reality. Getting 2nd dose next week! Can't wait! Sweet Mobile Home Alabama!

Where COVID’s coming you! read current favorite poet, helped little. Today yesterday, I'm going blast to-do list give sense accomplishment. Hope good one friend second trial checking whether actually get away one shot. may one shot good immune response get second one becomes lot better. See stopped caring long ago. Corona practically isn’t thing Sweden, subject people talk lunch breaks. ""So get last week, way wants it."" reinfections asymptomatic, great. Asymptomatic people much less likely spread virus. Hope places follow suit! California/LA could use high quality masks, one. Yes please. covid lowkey turned nihilist new variant “Japan” (actually Brazil) E484K mutation mutation causing concern SA variant. mutation thought enable antibody escape. 

Unfortunately Brazil isn’t best sequencing virus can’t truly determine reinfections driving what’s happening Manaus. logistics distribution. lead people flocking place sells masks, inevitably causing transmission crowds. think people realize scarier immediate threat flu sway them. never gotten flu shot rarely get flu it’s manageable. However sleeve already lift vaccine. worried thing.

So hope others think like eager get it.

Summer 2021! vector vaccines

The concept vector viruses gene therapy vaccines old. Approved vector vaccines new. People also overlook fact US massive pharma infrastructure place pandemic. countries capable making enough vaccines population. believe Canada zero vaccine production capability. 

We hate big pharma suddenly really need big pharma. Keep man alive costs. premiums high uninsured afford even subsidies.

Which suggests make much income, large family. Less 100 confirmed reinfections worldwide. people keep proving they’re terrible humans. vast groups people regular internet access idea order anything online. simply fall hard poorest vulnerable people, measures, ""thought through"" image ""average citizen"" mind. homeless people, money, going fined every day fancy mask, adding constantly accumulating debts? anyone religiously follow new fads government comes with, year bombarded yet another fancy new idea bureaucrat?

Nobody cares. amazing easily world's brainwashed.

I'll say 🙄 CDC's COVID death demographics (a days behind)

I wish gone fir prefusion well eliminate COVID, long enough timeline breaks regardless restriction level. Epidemiologists saying population level immunity effect outbreaks parts Europe US. very, little natural immunity, social distancing breaks Fall/Winter, experience even bigger wave, occurred Ireland California.

People's breaks ignore restrictions. Lockdowns/restrictions limited resource, western governments needed understand rather relying letting people go hungry/broke starved company. approach combination mass testing (weekly tests citizens, even must done pooled testing), contact tracing, masks, therapeutics development scaled massively government funding, social distancing combined substantial financial support people losing livelihood distancing.

Social distancing *alone* sustainable. solution. needs massive support take onus individual people ""doing right thing.""

That's probably bullshit. even isn't, beside point. everyone's going get H1N1, public health authorities (you know, ""trusted experts"") wanted *everyone* get vaccine. 

In US, starting IIRC April May 2009, CDC directed hospitals test everyone presenting flu symptoms pandemic strain. Know result was? Well, [in Florida actually pretty high 17%, California, Georgia, Alaska 2, 2, 1% exactly impressive numbers.

If Gardasil strong protective effect cervical cancer, would obvious data. obvious, can't see evidence benefit all. anything they're occurring earlier age makes sense unless Gardasil somehow harm good. 

It even really matter Gardasil causing excess cancers (possible), unintended effect (like vaccinated women forgoing pap smears). point public health authorities pushing vaccine everyone singing praises--even though evidence vaccine actually supposed to. one reasons I'm generally skeptical.

**AMERICA!!! FUCK YEAAAA** old ones need buried Yucca mountain.  us. wish kid vaccine fall 2021 school lot people feel vaccine used ransom re-open. watching BBC video lady said won’t get principle basically trying force people. Others don’t feel like government ever reopen anyway aren’t even bothering. worrisome. strange. got mine 4 days ago far good I’ve hear number 2 worse many people fun begins people flouting rules getting sick did. went well, arm sore tingling legs hands overall bad. Coworkers mine got though anything migraine fever diarrhea experience may differ.  never locked California. Hell even Southern California epicenter pandemic, retail malls still ducking open. one also newer type vaccine, different Pfizer Moderna. one like Oxford vaccine that’s received lot press. likelihood significantly reduce asymptomatic spread, Oxford vaccine studied whether participants asymptomatically infected. study showed significant protection asymptomatic infection, it’s pretty reasonable expect rest too. It’s frustrating vaccines didn’t study this.  Yeah straight asked ineffective flu vaccine got answer wanted. won’t get flu vaccine I’ll get covid one hope you’re right, supply wise sounds optimistic. article written Australian context, start summer right vaccination begun. two Covid deaths Australia past two months.

I think compliance lack motivation problem Australia face going forward. Many states become used cases ever. going adjustment vaccinated open borders, unlikely remain zero cases. Imagine way tell someone vaccinated wearing set Mickey ears say “Vaccinated!” 

Or maybe like Elsa crown Frozen says “Vaccine Queen” 😂 learned today Tbf regarding vaccine part quickest we've ever gotten vaccine. kind plausible early pandemic think get vaccine year. quite phenomenal we've able develop several covid vaccines year 18, get anyway. risk sounding stupid:

Isn't risky stadium full people? Even getting vaccine?

I keep picturing nightmare scenario catching en route finally getting vaccine. paranoid? got shots. First shot side effects sore arm. Second shot side effects minor flu like feeling couple days went away. biggest side effect fatigue. wanted nap lot that, pretty easy totally worth it. 

My colleagues felt however symptoms 2nd shot. Get vaccine don’t know much eat restaurant? crazy? Holy shit first clicked thought title “US Daily Covid Cases...” 0_0 PHEW! even hitting 50% adoption flu vaxs. I'm praying. guys normal end March. lockdown justification seniors vaccinated end February. Endemic ≠ Epidemic OP needs clarify he's Alabama start throwing word impossible around. Can’t believe eyes?

Sweden compared neighboring nations yet New Zealand, tiny island nation population HALF size LA County often “what about...” nation used sub defend lockdown policies. Sounds legit. hope narrated process. Finally good fucking news  Brilliant thanks - I'm UK seller's use, maybe 'over head' search term looking for! giving people 20s doesn’t necessarily help bring home. supplies Covaxin prioritized public market, direct procurement Brazil government, company said statement. He’s still pushing this. It’s honestly kind sad point. totally agree ""eager beavers"" thing lol. people super willing come get shots, give them! move on. get done quick instead adhering categories strictly. Agreed. Things way overcomplicated targeting specific groups. Tell everyone 75 go Walgreens, show ID, get vaccine. drop 65. 55. complicate process slow down, people die. really think pointless doomer pessimism. suspend almost social interaction year. That’s pretty fucking bad, something dismissed “It get worse.” Yes, climate change problem, world filled political turmoil, we’re verge ecological collapse, bad things aren’t going stop able hug family. I’m saying COVID worse threats coming ahead, certainly isn’t going seem tame comparison them. Anyone wearing masks shoved hallway deal rioters.  also say “deaths different prior years! MSM manipulating you!” quote tweet dude date deaths. Small World

Its time end social distancing ride one cramped, tiny worlds fiction /s Cool story, still waiting get first next generation vaccine finished phase 3 clinical trial properly. It’s reason. course don’t like it. course criticize it. know well reasons slow start are, don’t act like reasons. It’s justification, reason. Haha everyone vaccinated see huge drop deaths, hospitalizations, ICU usage, you. 75% isn’t even factoring without 65’s hospitals, hospital care 65’s improve immensely. lower deaths problematic group also taking giant load healthcare system. Get 2 birds stoned once. Thanks! one said don’t work, maybe better cloth masks (though doubt makes difference day-to-day environment). issue extremely excessive one. also claim patience solidarity ridiculous compared nothingness done speed vaccines. cannot claim biggest crisis since WWII. act without urgency regarding one thing resolve Yeah that’s smart. start bankrolling million venues sudden vaccines don’t work new strain totally screwed. people feel confident things safely go back normal help finance sure  Perfect thanks.

Cool username. would anyone believe RIVM say masks called ineffective 90% pandemic?

Reusing masks successfully tested hospitals even. [TU Delft works reusable surgical masks Reinier de Graaf FFP2 masks certified use one entire shift several hours, one (except staff) spends 4 hours Lidl Saturday. shit-show much people sometimes show appointment. happens normally - things happen, whether traffic, missing alarm clock, etc.

Even one two people missing appoointment day vaccination facilities, keep mind thousands hospitals (and probably thousands vaccination sites) US. adds large number, even rate lower.

At point, ethical thing get shot someone's arm, regardless group they're in. Or, might enough people kill bottle vaccine off, they're planning ahead putting OP standby. Yeah got community building instead pharmacy might sped process. 

Btw happy cake day. Thanks explaining mean surprised Fauci benefiting significantly covid too. went nobody household name. impossible little bias stemming that.

The goal save lives avoiding looking like idiot. people reddit incapable beeing disingenuous?

No, strong positive bias comes government folks. state opposite they've previously stated take 4ever evidence herd immunity strategy...

Well, pretty much. else would want achieve herd immunity me. Sweden close schools?

We initially. Universities aside. government give FFP2 masks recently. prices surging might get people reusing lot recommended. Moderna would like word consider valid reason? BEYOND unacceptable.
all government heads keep pumping solidarity, Merkel goes emotional speech everyone claiming biggest crisis since WWII. acting without urgency regarding one thing resolve  add- 

Even mutations make contagious play favor- often make less lethal. case 1.1.7.B variant, often true broadly Yeah, Ireland great. highest rate world. rub shirt, fuzzy blanket, well. 


Basically, anything would make zap also works static-charge masks. lack doses right that's holding back vaccinations across EU? seems EU going rather slow apart maybe Denmark thing would find much easier clear transparent information. Oregon put teachers ahead elderly one knows timeline is. assumed would 1b healthcare workers, don’t even know I’m 1c 1d. Besides we’ve given 25 percent vaccines right now. feel like moving N.

America: cause of, solution to, worlds problems Concert, festival, musical industries going put another summer closures. Even conservative estimates (Dr. Fauci) say elderly/high risk fully vaccinated April. Back normal summer. We'll see. Masks likely mandate end year least fall suspect. Idk people wear restrictions loosened. Isn’t whole point? 320-340 Christmas depending source. Seems like prediction exactly right. 350 worst case scenario that. nowhere close 400.  remember back UK approved pfizer EU ciriticised saying rushed it. next thing know moved original timeline approving 29th December 21st realised slow we're being.  new factor virus mutation UK.

""Good governance"" according people values way line typical western liberal values, sure.

""public health efforts"" ignore concerns necessary public health. balance health outcomes given policy values underlying society well whether trade one source concern others. goal keep people healthy GENERALLY, keep getting relatively innocuous disease expense others could worse.

Furthermore, everyone, default, believes actions taken WWII valid, even did, fact large public support policies vs lukewarm public support similar policies important distinction. reconcile fact millions Americans fundamentally opposed values respect deal pathogen saying ""if would act like think should"" response. dream. reality policymakers facing. charge totalitarianism recognition draconian central control people, recognition control undesired. everyone wants wear red shirts, law says wear red shirts die, definitely totalitarian, certainly far less binding form.

Having tunnel vision one specific disease - disease know unlikely (as in, less 1% likelihood) cause fatalities amongst largest, socially active, productive portions population - detriment healthcare concerns, let alone non-medical trade-offs motivate us even care alive first place, pursuing aggressive disproportionate policy iron fist simply totalitarianism. unilateral, aggressive, state policy threat personal destruction everyone agree prognosis.

Guys, take win. Jesus. Fauci literally said ""Fall"" normal...after said spring...then summer...then late summer....then fall....so we'll back summer 2022. anyone know figure vaccine ""took""? 

My limited understanding vaccines \~95% effective, meaning 95% people, 100% effective, 5% 0% effective. means body create antibodies.

Is strategy get antibody test take vaccine doses see 95%? antibody test pick vaccine antibodies, real virus antibodies (if even difference)? Thanks! ""the french""

It's like watching try trickle economics 50th time. Given happening Ireland (ten-fold increase per-capita case 3 weeks) UK, predicted happen everywhere Danish equivalent CDC, March, well multiple epidemiologists, due community spread B117 variant, opening right absolutely worst thing do.

Letting shortsightedness businesses dictate re-openings always leads infections deaths. Always. Always. Always.  Biiiig fucking “If” there.

It important note Sweden’s excess deaths causes though. Quite low haven’t surge non-Covid causes death like many countries different strategies had.   Let's ignore response-to-COVID long term effects. Also America! Sure, still puts US UK top world.

Keeping schools open, half hearted lockdowns, cutting 6 ft 3 ft, paying people eat crowded restaurants ... scientific studies justifying measures. instance ""children catch spread covid"" narrative ... 10 times worse ever was. many decisions taken benefit economy mind without understanding economy comprised people safety people would best economy. able look Britain wonder one highest rates infection one highest rates death time economy one worst hit boot. hope opportunity arises, electorate express frustrations vote. recent estimate lethality? going down? virus mutations adapting hosts live longer? without astrazeneca j&amp;j yet! fantastic news! rate we’re gonna great spring/summer know 🤪 mask already, sentenced starvation, can't get anywhere buy without it?

The whole point allowing home made ""masks"" exactly avoid impossible situation. hordes people completely fucked however problem anyone seems. Time get bribe CVS Lol line population control shots ,bcs flu 0,03% mortality rates. reasarch see numerous links rushed vaccine sterilization. Plus Bill Gates obsessed population control via vaccines gets invest vaccine... used Africa moved keep begging get quickly made vaccine. amazing easily world's brainwashed. begs question, going worst regardless do?

I've heard person locally entirely isolated bar daughter bringing shopping, ended getting devastating one, including man knows got it. 

Then town, family road got virus, except 1 them. There's 5 them! Google Typhoid Mary. one million case illness didn’t run course eventually get killed immune system like normal, hung around proliferating body rest life. dont want protect others highly recommend half mask respirators.

comfortable, get FFP3/N100 filters filter last till whole thing over.

only downside, filtering exhausted air. would look volunteering help distribution. See local sites promising vaccinate volunteers go there. helping get shots faster get vaccinated process win win. Obvious would risk fully vaccinated since low risk decent strategy. Agreed. hate it. I'm glad mom died shit started. know side woulda depressing. 
 Facebook joke. hate feeling need react ""feel"" certain way post. like held hostage damn phone! Can't stand it. Maybe, think government fining someone minding business harming anyone disturbing. Sorry used wrong word.  Except Israel got entire nation's worth vaccine supply (and bought LOT) New Jersey gotten like 2.7% United State's supply. different Phase 3 AZ, perform surveillance swabs. sure though some. clear.  majority people aren’t getting infected public. true seeing Israel's cases go yet? accept virus, love one's death due it. also confronted questioning many beliefs including identity. would rather die question identity sadly have. No, he's right. stats 101. Different groups people respond identical questions differently due number factors. accounted way data collected analyzed. Daily cases seem peak holidays followed artificial decrease due less testing holidays. still hope cases still flat recent increase bounce-back phenomenon (less less hope days go given yet). 

Either way, right: Flattening time high level cases would lead reduction deaths rather leveling deaths, time high--over 3300 day. I'm sure model updated reflect reality soon. 

Usually flattening cases followed drop hope happened happen soon. Keep calm dont give fuck. Money rulez...yipieeeehhh kind think needs to. international economic hub. Yes now, trying go crazy stressing out. 

Maybe it’s anxiety it’s doesn’t understand getting haircut risk, idk judgement regarding symptom, ya know?  **NOT** KNOWN VACCINE STOPS ABILITY TRANSMISSION COVID VACCINATED PEOPLE NON VACCINATED PEOPLE. KNOW PEOPLE GET VACCINE GET SICK. 

And yes, shouting. trying drill extremely simple concept head, since ignored first 5 times it’s said. 

Once get rid D, entire premise collapses. So.Just.Stop.

Also, yes, data shows that’s it’s long term trend(hospitalizations deaths). virus hits older folks much, much harder younger folks. hospitalizations morality similar 18-29 year old age range, wouldn’t care much virus. can't super hardline. New York City massive international economy stays level closed, always lag behind be. Everyone business NYC start pressure Cuomo DeBlasio open vote donate them.

I'm worried SF keeping restrictions. lot businesses I've seen settled nicely WFH culture bubble seems pro-restriction. least money pro-restriction. There's literally evidence anyone's even considering this. Right ""Orwellian"" re: misused terms. worked Florida. symptom diarrhea? wouldn’t go crazy stressing Doesn’t look steady me. day ago Fauci saying fall, theaters ""back normal,"" wear masks. logical implication he's redefining ""normal"" include masks. What's also weird vaccine data released, back September, saying year maskless theaters would safe. Given later remarks premised fast distribution vaccines, understand within exactly timeframe thought theaters *without* masks would safe, 95% efficacious vaccine comes out, even *full herd immunity* masks required unspecified period time clear metric, even incorporated definition ""normal"" (which means would bleed things besides large events. Something very, *weird* going on. Yeah probably right, say near enough though. Depending bunch factors, might actually enough, particularly depending country conjunction vaccines. mean least since Bircher we've always element. growing though.  think probably pay bit closer attention replying to, said what. multiple people replying showing empathy. One person person callous ass, lashing literally everyone replying - even trying offer suggestions help. appreciate wearing mask easy everyone, especially children special needs glad part. calling ass again? Good. Better late never. downvoted. taught every entry-level stats course  Sublime policy. Sad...  Good old curfews, protecting everyone virus becomes contagious 8PM. Nothing except staying home stops 100%. Masks lessen chance transmitting others blocking vapor droplets coming mouth nose. I'm lucky stay home. Many can't senators representatives given what's happening government right now. republicans know well anyone still refused minimum protect others. need trust supply lines already are. Holding back 50% makes sense expect production suddenly halt.

Even held back 25%, production could drop *half* overnight (despite quickly ramping up) still enough vaccinate everyone doses. reddit, apparently. Sir Patrick Stewart get one too? One 3 fave englishmen article say can’t anything vaccinated people. read it? said safe hang inside vaccinated people. Honestly you’re 40, don’t need mask protect yourself. Sounds like whole lot real estate would open affordable housing. grocery stores arnt following rules? Safeway best buy target limiting customers all. following capacity rules. shop early morning 7-8am avoid crowds. obviously better nothing, R0 order 3-4 that's enough get herd immunity.  large ass take time heat 😀 /r/TIHI strawman much pain ass masks are. want wear one pandemic fine everyone wants to.

It's perfectly okay look forward wearing anymore soon hospitals threatened time drop mandates leave individuals choose.  agree. everything conspiracy. open wrong.

But right governor quomo looking reopen everything. soon Biden takes office suddenly everything fine.

Also, criminal court nothing sit around deal conspiracies day. Unless deny criminal courts exist, conspiracies going around us times. 

Several people conspiracy theorists comes trump. Trump enriching presidency. Trump gonna take government. Etc. Ironically Jesus Christ known hang outcasts society, including sex workers. said thing loud right reading comment. 78 yr old stepmother lives NYC, used love Cuomo Spring, sees turd punchbowl, needs vaccine now, Cuomo decides dick around politics, wanted give prisoners drug addicts priority vulnerable, elderly, even Deblasio can't stand Cuomo gangster way show recovery Covid... emerging monster Tamale maker. 

Good , Grandma involved manufacturing, distribution administration vaccine. straighten SNAFU right out! Thanks saying this. makes feel little sane again. ""could"" reopen immediately, safety concerns damned.

However, smart crowd waiting seeing to, know, actually happening, epidemic-wise.

You make optimistic proclamations worst possible peak pandemic. downright irresponsible, like Fauci's earlier advice masks needed worn public. 

/Fauci reminds dumbass boomers know, constantly lamenting they're unable go cruises right now, actively planning summer fall. probably depends live. past weekend usual trip grocery store about, couldn’t even tell coronavirus thing went store. Normal traffic, packed streets, normal weekend, etc. Seems like we’ve put faith tiny, little masks hoped best. 

Once vaccine starts getting public, feel new mask debate general mitigation rule debate grabs people wonder certain rules relaxed. issue arises people start taking masks start claiming vaccinated. course, didn’t see much typical flu vaccine I’m sure they’ve working years years already plan Bs person catch flu. Covid though, it’s still gamble still unvaccinated trusting public may time low depending past year treating you.

Don’t know people get first dose, even FULL first dose that, don’t know second dose guaranteed set timeframe President-Elect Biden able hit today, ultimate unknown vaccine mean it’s ok away masks first months (a year probably won’t even question).

For probably good portion year us, we’ll weird state waiting doses, weird state things we’ve wanted months peace judging behaviors time, I’m sure people ready rip masks second (maybe even first) dose regardless action’s possible repercussions.   Yeah, suggesting February going “corner turn” we’re hoping for, hopefully vaccinations happening Jan 1 noticeable death rate reduction mid-late Feb since heavy focus risk populations. think you’re right late spring - hit stride vaccinations February March late April May could turn. Here’s hoping! Well technically work exploitative. full grown adults wanna put body full mental faculties, allowed so. support it, welcome spend money it. wrong, Instagram bit different get OnlyFans. terms follower numbers well people follow reasons. someone takes care people show Emergency Department due exacerbations chronic illness due nonadherence medications, bit hard judge skeptics yourself.

This literally Trump getting pilloried (and rightfully so)!!! Cuomo regularly said heartless sake lives economy yadda yadda tweet taken almost word word Trump! anyone see is?! people really memories group/ group bias really amazingly powerful? Portugal went downhill pretty hard far month worries. appreciate details. 

So half states seem separate California NY measures. that's 15% 17% 65+. states clumped together relatively small band. 

It seem like that's really statistically significant difference terms Covid Cases deaths. many rural states range, many worse dense states like CA even NY, got cases earlier, multi-generational households, population-dense areas. 

For Florida, note snowbirds, Florida’s winter population 65 older goes order magnitude, snowbirds residents states like New York.

That Florida count statistics. go towards NY stats. goes back early days. one shot, hope gets approval soon Yes data might ready September doesn’t mean anything vaccine actually ready. data still submit everything FDA process take long time it’s children. work Pharma industry. promise children 12 see FDA approved vaccine till 2023-2024 thing lot people think go back “normal” without reaching herd immunity pretty unrealistic. Illinois dropping case numbers solid month now. it’s every state. It’s one step process. start distribution. Lay rules let people line up, first come first serve stands according shitty southern state's COVID vaccine plan, I'm slated receive ""Nov-Dec 2021"". 

COVID summer. want, I'll happy message six months prove wrong want. might part reason.

Totally, lot parents already sending children back school money keep home. 

Seems lot folks worried this, many families able hold financially. Kind situation choice is: ""do quit job stay home son? keep putting food table send back school, even might contract C-19?"" Obviously different families dealing vastly different situations, hopefully solutions help everybody interim.  doesn’t say anything document ?? understand states focused getting vaccines arms seniors ASAP.

To quite honest, think states got caught listening experts. CDC's recommendations 65-74 C group. 75+ B group (people nursing homes group). Ultimately plan far rigid.

Texas Florida first break CDC's guidelines, issues things like setting appointments (your relatives lucky, people gone injection sites, waited, turned away lot difficulty actually getting appointment online.)

Love showing women love Try looking store called “Patel Brothers” nearby, might go hunting local Asian markets, meat markets, international markets.

I local city population 100k plenty, also get lot stuff Chicago too. you’re near large US cities there’ll lot them. There's Desantis Defense Force comments article people hating FL.

Do guys sort new FL? opinion article? reference? Illinois peak cases 15k day Florida peaked 30k day. fuzzy math makes number one spot? Keep flexing fella. Full half adults US high risk one way another (obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes). mortality rate “low risk” people still isn’t low want virus raging population.

They’re largest spreaders.

You easily use campuses mass vaccinate. point, production ramping iust fotta open everybody wants it. God dammit. seeing name &amp; Covid sentence made heart skip beat... Heh BC they're extending second dose 3 weeks 4 weeks. information directly drawn science (looking studies). Yes, mean using medication ""off label"" that's something that's borne necessity decades. Actually come Monday Tuesday cuz that's what's good stocks normal one too... Could be, could also difference reporting due culture whatever.  Ugh, Mass seems like mess vaccine distribution perspective. Slow report rollout, slow update target groups, slow actual vaccination. Despite one vaccine makers right state.

My elderly parents now, considering traveling get vaccine another state (IMO, horrible idea months waiting little traction, understand mentality) wasn’t wearing mask video showed wasn’t. mask gas mask hands. I've predicting one last harsh winter followed things slowing getting better starting Spring going Summer. current vaccination rates keep picking up, may happen. extent, miss office, definitely want go back permanently. like coworkers maybe 20% job needs physically, ideal arrangement would something like going office 1 2 days week working home rest. Regardless, hope opens door lot companies flexible employees. ? I’m confused you’re saying mention need get vaccine get covid ... otherwise kinda defeats purpose Username check Horribly bad I'm glad sub come around plan. headlines Florida Texas this, people freaked out, mostly due political lines. elderly masks free, even work well, crappy logistics.  Reality there's way I'm going able travel time near future. It'll summer earliest get time off. Working living fun.  Basically bats  newsworthy rare, however coronaviruses natural herd immunity, tend recur population every 2-3 years. likely need continual vaccination campaigns. Oh sweet baby Jesus, all's saw sir David's name almost soiled myself.... again, vaccine known stop able infect others. stops you, personally, getting sick. Therefore, person 20s person benefits getting vaccine. known benefit greater society. known benefit elderly getting vaccine. 50% chance 50% people f\*\*cked get vaccine.  Thanksgiving perhaps, Christmas New Years sure. 50% infection rate week jump alot now...great job idiots reason Drs. Fauci, Birx, Tam TV talking etc..

There evidence show widespread all. Hundreds thousands cases day, barely confirm couple cases actual long term damage day.

Long covid hyped media brings clicks. scientific backing Yes ! Exactly experience too. fuck ?! know worked I’d fucking mask fuck up. mean fair, think point wait loved ones people see regularly vaccinated anything. think totally reasonable hang groups without masks distancing even go restaurants long public spaces still follow rules could around people vaccinated yet  lockdown? That's inaccurate explanation masks work. N95 masks filters least 95% particles 0.3 microns. effective larger sizes, larger particles collide filter, also effective smaller sizes, Brownian motion knock small particles filter material.

Regardless, clear N95 KN95 mask work far better cloth one. personally wear P100 respirator due reusability. scream want, accept whatever, product launches take ramp up, often due random stuff comes unpredictably. Israel many things well good setting great digital health records burden federal system, end, something could delays whatever - even though fact easy think everyone could done good Isreal, actually N 1 analysis complex contigent world. lockdown/social distancing measures made pandemic itself, let's kid ourselves. problem epidemic number hospitalisations high healthcare system handle, thus leading overwhelmed deaths coronavirus causes spike. soon ICUs hospital beds free restrictions start lifted worldwide (of course locally, travel take longer). got symptoms? Might enough stop that. we're talking days 1-2 weeks (which makes sense production hiccup - could always pause / reschedule first doses following weeks' shipments make room delayed second doses), sure. 

Our basic knowledge immunology works shows antibodies fade time instantly vanish day 21 day 28.

The fact Moderna Pfizer vaccines near-identical terms mRNA delivered trigger immune response, Moderna's protocol calls 28 days Pfizer 21 that's happened pick studies, showed similar results, indication week huge deal.

 study protocols never followed exact precision, everyone got second shot 21 days later, delayed days, weeks, even skipped second shot, numbers large track results original study report.

Three months late (like UK doing) whole nother ball wax, starts get long enough people worry efficacy. 

That's Pfizer publicly criticized initial decision hold back second doses US, also criticized UK's decision delay long. shopped off-hours March curbside became available. I've twice subs since March. Grocery store crowded two trips lots COVidiots honoring one-way aisles. attitude going used dismiss symptoms everyone really suffering it.

Particularly since skew women. Sir, time? vaccine enough time build full protection system yet. 

I asked elsewhere, I'm wondering vaccine help develop less severe symptoms? know studied yet. We're month 11 pandemic. Yes, ""safest"" thing COVID-wise never leave home never see another human being. takes huge mental toll people (and Zoom real interaction). Social interaction important. ppl may cleaning lady, plumber, dog groomer, professor daycare staff.

I've got zero Lol genuinely don’t understand people think things going better year. 2020 wasn’t anomaly. culmination decades politics tension, systematic gutting social welfare programs, raping environment, rise anti intellectualism. NEJM.  “Natural infection produces variable antibody longevity”   honestly, going &amp; mixing peers, see room parents vaccinated. Right virus spread younger ppl asymptomatically within multigenerational households. That's hitting Latinos particularly hard. 20-somethings either asymptomatic barely symptomatic, middle-aged &amp; elderly relatives come contact develop severe complications. hospital system that's verge triage, let's say they're going receive level care Donald Chris Christie did. vaccines US China. matter time show every states, need accelerate vaccination, keep mask wearing, stay away people. beat thing It’s bound happen point sounds awfully optimistic totally hope right. People inherently inner focused large majority little issues virus. Combine two throw sponge brain Facebook automatons yeah, people get pretty silly ignore vs grasp evidence.  teachers get NY starting today, teachers FL wait till April, May June? Different states prioritizing different people based age job. Sounds like national plan place. forget something? don’t see constitutes excuse. reason go. go. bet higher, actual immunogenicity data vaccine real solid, don’t think effective Pfizer Moderna (being 1-dose), think it’ll land somewhere 75-85% effective primary endpoint 100% (“100%” never really possible it’ll appear way) effective preventing severe disease. Every vaccine far incredible preventing severe disease. ockdowns halfassed. serious lockdown one all. know beat thing countries full mUh FrEeDuMbS idiots, yet one seems want it. Lol, probably favorite stat time. fairly safe, still hanging friends. However I'm looking cases thinking might time mess around... happy this! Keep up! forget one. I'll look discussion comment back.

Edit: think noravax. finish phase 3 sometime February looks like. Seems like everyone turn. There’s plenty sex work men, willing work men. sub thinks vaccine end all, life knew months away. guess I’m hesitant, it’s nice hope don’t hopes yet. know I’m minority, still all, guess I’m ok sitting tight keep others safe courts previously ruled requirements like disadvantage certain groups. People rights regardless legal status. Depends vaccination campaign goes. early tell.  parents, first timers. getting better already least 1 4 homeless people women good feeling next months we'll start see actually good rollout. Even things like soft power presidency able give good guidance best practices would helpful. Like...""oh hey guys, north Dakota really well practice rural folks""  No, there's need waste resources. bet 69 THATS SEX NUMBER much info besides that.  Oh awful!! Profit = money = power I'm part social distancing gorillas. Yes, big majority likely first weeks (testing non-existent unless already hospitalized) doubt huge asymptomatic increase happening right new strain. 

By summer would bet estimated % people has/had COVID worldwide gonna 20%. Fauci also talked immunity passports, idea simply dystopian. benefits worth ridiculously bad optics precedent creating two tiered society, especially tiers undoubtedly break age class. J&amp;J else? fair agree it’s unlikely. guess got heated seeing takes people. Politically unlikely due popularity however Anyone know little ones might get vaccine? I’ve got 3 kids, 2 blood disorder, 4. They’re home husband work I’m readddyy done. End end rope. 


I wish could say “fuck it, we’ll chance it” send daycare, would never forgive babies severe case(s) ongoing side effects. 


I’m getting worried longer hear crickets kids get vaccinated. haven’t heard timeline kids! talked kids’ hematologist hadn’t heard anything, either :/ halllppp. relevant comparing EU.

Israel's population comparable size Austria, Sweden, Portugal, Greece, Switzerland, Belgium, Czech Republic, Hungary, Belarus, Serbia Bulgaria, significantly larger Denmark, Norway, Finland, Slovakia, Ireland, Croatia, Moldova, Lithuania, Slovenia, Latvia on.

But even look absolute numbers, Israel vaccinated total people European country UK. ELI5: headline. No. unfortunately prioritizing 50 million young healthy people instead (essential workers). already posted daily thread today, still don’t understand people think it’s absurd. hate Cuomo case he’s right. even true. Food stamps TANF (which comes lot stipulations often hard meet, always available everyone eligible) enough mother children buy food essentials pay rent. ""meal ticket"" enough keep people homelessness. We're also going get two new vaccines approved next month. addition oxford vaccine able released. tally improves catch-up previous days. troop gorillas San Diego Zoo Safari Park Escondido, Calif., tested positive coronavirus. fecal examination detected virus last Friday, results confirmed Agriculture Department's National Veterinary Services Laboratories Monday. San Diego Zoo Global, owns park, says infected gorillas pose threat public.  What? FL? Land honesty! surely jest!

Seriously, personally know people died included statistics. numbers joke. This. Equal rights gonna sit take pics feet go spread concrete. 

I mean... guess men bring buying pics really concrete still. front line healthcare worker, nothing says appreciate like homemade food. great even (got 17% vaccinated even deal). deal allow keep pace going forward almost ran vaccines week, shipments landing last couple days replenish instead February. carry water, learn value every drop I’m ok ordered 40 million cause asked 👍 MBA oversaturated saw Masters program Political Science many people get dont actually know much outside field.

Now, it’s reeling financially crushing side effects coronavirus, cratering revenue crisis spending force reckoning massive pile government debt.

The pandemic hurtling heavily leveraged nations economic danger zone, threatening bankrupt worst-affected. Costa Rica, country known zip-lining tourists American retirees, scrambling stave full-blown debt crisis, imposing emergency cuts proposing harsher measures touched rare violent protests last fall. keep lights on, progressive, eco-friendly nation weighing desperate solutions — including open-pit gold mining, even oceanic fracking.

“Costa Rica facing social crisis,” said Ana Rosa Ruiz, economist Costa Rican Technological Institute.

Around globe, pandemic racking mind-blowing bill: trillions dollars lost tax revenue, ramped-up spending new borrowing set burden next generation record levels debt. direst cases — low- middle-income countries, mostly Africa Latin America, already saddled backbreaking debt — covering rising costs transforming high-stakes test national solvency.

Analysts call “debt tsunami”: National accounts sinking red record pace.

“I consider risk high emerging-market debt crisis lot countries run problems once,” said Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist International Monetary Fund. “This going rocky road.”
'A big crack ice'

By end 2020, total government debt worldwide projected soar $9 trillion top 103 percent global GDP, according Institute International Finance — historic jump 10 percentage points one year. Countries maxed figurative credit cards buy medical equipment, set field hospitals, deploy health-care workers source vaccines, even pandemic-related recessions caused tax revenue plunge aid unemployed spike. Countries rely tourism, ground virtual halt, commodities like oil sunk price felt sting keenly.

The United States run debt pace seen since World War II. world’s wealthy nations better able cope growing debt poorer counterparts.

Angola, contrast, effectively shut global markets, racing strike deal Chinese, even might enough prevent painful debt crisis. Sri Lanka, locked recession, needs make $4 billion debt payments year $6 billion bank. Brazil’s debt, worsened yawning budget deficit, surged crippling 95 percent GDP — raising alarm medium-term ability Latin American giant stay afloat.


The IMF World Bank sought aid vulnerable states, world’s wealthiest nations endorsed plan October extend suspension debt payments owed poorest. November, nations additionally agreed jointly work toward form debt relief poorest nations seek them, also encouraged private lenders follow suit.

But analysts say may enough. Thirty-eight low-income countries either debt distress, according IMF, high risk falling it. Unless private creditors wealthy nations step agree concessions outright debt forgiveness, pandemic’s fiscal shock could hurl those, well highly leveraged middle-income countries Costa Rica, toward catastrophic national bankruptcies.

Analysts argue need stimulus keep economies running historically challenging period still outweighs need balance budgets. Even IMF, global guardian fiscal rectitude, telling countries time scrimp, lest jeopardize still-fragile economic recoveries. Towns, cities, ships. situational remember technology level. PCR testing see someone infected. Probably lots mistakes science wise. really like comment general, need point 1 especially glaring error. state “prioritizing vulnerable”, outside states simply true. instead prioritizing ~50 million “essential workers” (mostly young healthy incredibly low risk) placing wave actually vulnerable. Great news! keep up! Covid never sense disease never eradicated. vulnerable people vaccinated (or recovered disease) starts become dangerous flu. significant portion general population vaccinated (or recovered disease) becomes level common cold. 

So, always there, something worry months, life go back normal. think one, expect die ailments. Thousands dying disease illness daily, pre-COVID. It’s hard thing get arms around choice have?  can’t fun I’m allowed get medical procedure I’m willing get, it’s fair allow others many strippers trafficked?
Never heard any.. I'm sure understand point. would need live rest life isolation? Even herd immunity reached vaccination, person safe they're vaccinated. Strictest restriction nominally virtually zero enforcement widespread flouting said restrictions. love Patel brothers, opened biggest location Chicago burbs near much gov funding helps, really doesn’t help small biz much. lose clients regulars reputation long term. Crime table manual labor Yeah, US UK top world vaccination per capita, orders magnitude ahead Europe, mention almost every place face planet. Constructive criticism great, getting ridiculous. Rule 4 sub: avoid politics. There’s better way say it’s really productive conversation. FL, expanded Medicaid, starters. Well exactly they’re saying many 23 million Covid cases actually flu. Don’t forget add 13 million documented Americans many undocumented millions already COVID add herd immunity. Still, vaccines either way. good thing! 85 percent workers hate job half batch Look, wrong many reasons deadliness...but wrong need herd immunity. 

Once general public 50 starts getting vaccinations, at-risk groups taken care of, folks received vaccine start going things. Maybe late fall, winter. (In washington even start May, add five weeks second dose, so, early fall first receive). 

Might crazy Halloween New Years, otherwise, expect little change many places. Remember states locked they’re melting down. choice one everyone made. lets forget dismantling NHS via tories? Never.

I want would surprised. waited 10 hrs hospital bed last week. I'm even *really* hard hit area. 

10 hrs ER, hooked antibiotics, truly sucked.

Pls stay FL. 40 what? Yes, immunity binary, vaccine 95% effective preventing symptoms, doesn’t really make practical difference. amount vaccine sent states based full time resident numbers..  haven’t done enough research. flu long term effects well, don’t read daily 400 days straight. best take people like first line UK Pfizer too. 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! Thats better. Still need bump numbers double gonna get done half year. Seriously. can't take much this. glanced thought said ""Sir David Attenborough died Covid-19"" Maybe try couple loops yarn? tying hat? elastic material may better stuff mentioned above. try tying twine elastic middle. get tension right, ought work. going excuse perpetuate another decade excess. “Oh didn’t anything year. helped planet?

Wishful thinking part hoping experts charge start paying attention. choosing close 'lower grade schools' they're talking children driving force infection (albeit mistakenly so) thinking that's good thing help us achieve herd immunity faster (14th March).

Or, quarantining travellers recommending use face protection within health elder care, giving test, trace, isolate way early quite ironic since believe anything government says. :)

Oh consistent previous events. Let's limit South Korea pretend point. claim Christians, Koreans, behavioural habits contribute spread.


Would like examples? find plenty quick Google search. Wtf talking about? elderly vaccinated 2 months. Max. Yes, maybe number inflated some. can't deny speeding up...as expected. Mass vaccination sites going online daily. I'm usually pessimistic, signs pointing here. There's nothing I'm seeing allow us 80% back ""normal"" May/June low go They're rushing second dose...please read damn article. would give heart attack It’s controllable people decided don’t want *inconvenienced* measures takes get situation control. war ending matter what. Soviet involvement hastened ending. That’s hilarious idea behind virus becoming like common cold built assumption reinfections/infections vaccinated people far milder original infection presence immune memory. true almost everyone alive today eventually get either infected vaccinated, leaving future children almost always get asymptomatic/ cold-like infections anyway.

But I’m sure good assumption make not. handful documented reinfections rare (so far anyway, mutations could eventually make common) officially documenting requires sequencing available infections. Still, consistent pattern second infection producing mild/no symptoms. Sometimes true times second infection similar worse, including two mutations time produce strains significantly different original strain. hope best, think it’s important prepared possibility endemic Covid significant public health problem elderly health systems. Shhh. want scared. scared means right minds. Imagine inefficient rollout someone important receiving vaccine NOW. US states vaccine open anyone 65 65 preexisting health condition still aren’t running stock. fair move somewhere, I'm really tied geographic location right freedom choice. I'm obsessing personal health reasons though, want able see dad given immunocompromised is, that's even remotely possibility unless I'm vaccinated.  literally knight. What's problem? Seems like good idea 👍🏻

/s Yep. I’m 14 parents said can’t leave house get vaccinated. 

It sucks God held breath saw name sec understanding not* difference placebo regarding hospitalizations Sir David announced vaccination publicist, format 8-part documentary series. got vaccinated yesterday freling relief.

This headline gave real scare, brain registering Sir Attenborough COVID first. 

As coronavirus case numbers surge across country, it’s obvious places avoid: political rallies, large weddings, crowded bars, restaurants night clubs.

More more, health experts warn COVID-19 transmitted intimate get-togethers many us believed relatively safe: Dinner parties close, trusted friends. Game nights family members live different households. Sleepovers learning pods handful kids parents involved.

“Right now, seeing rampant increases transmission virus within community, often tied small gatherings small outbreaks controlled settings,” said Kirsten Hokeness, professor chair Department Science Technology Bryant University expert immunology, virology, microbiology human health disease.

Some health experts government officials calling kind transmission “living room spread.” It’s simple concept: people different households different social bubbles get together indoors sans masks ― share wings football game, instance, dinner party ― tend let guards down.

Friends family may swear they’ll keep separate tables corners room beforehand, moment, it’s easy fall back old habits: Masks get taken hear better, get closer, try sneak quick hug goodbye. We’re social animals, all, though longest eight months many lives, we’re still acclimating life COVID-19.

Still, virus passed asymptomatically, scenarios like scarily easy ways contract coronavirus. cousin close friend may appear healthy still carrier virus.

Unlike super-spreader events, “living room spread” mini spread events make contract tracing increasingly difficult health department officials, Hokeness said.

“What means need careful interact with, limiting necessary,” said. “We need decrease inner circles levels virus become manageable population.”

It’s worth noting epidemiologists say it’s impossible estimate much social gatherings contribute community transmission. stress large public gatherings remain biggest culprit. virus widespread, say it’s become increasingly difficult pinpoint single source outbreak.

“More more, exposures due community spread traceable single event,” Nicole Peske, chief communications officer North Dakota Department Health, told New York Times Monday. “Many individuals reporting one exposure.”

Still, state governments enacting restrictions limiting number people allowed gather private homes. Given control virus ― new infections surpassed 187,833 Friday, exceeding last daily record 10,000, number people hospitalized COVID-19 reached 80,000 ― couldn’t hurt scale back socializing.

We’re sick social distancing, get deeper winter months spend time indoors, it’s never important keep social circles teeny-tiny antisocial possible.

“It’s hard tell carrier virus infected,” said Jagdish Khubchandani, professor public health New Mexico State University. “We interact people walks life, people also interact others, it’s hard create circle keep track interacts who.”

“The best way avoid flooding hospitals responsible, stay family members, avoid going essential,” added.

If you’ve let people social bubbles quarantine pods last months, time tighten again. (Plus, vaccine sight, depressing would catch virus mere months distribution may possible?)

Sans vaccine, face masks tight-knit social bubbles best mechanisms protect other, Hokeness said. Khubchandani agreed maximum 10 people limitation bubble, factor family size, relatives close friends.

To safest, confine bubble people live household, said Nikole Benders-Hadi, medical director behavioral health Doctor Demand.

“To outline risk, think fact every new person come contact with, potentially exposed additional 5-10 individuals depending isolated (or not) person may recently been,” Benders-Hadi said.

Here’s effectively prune social bubble without coming across jerk.
At point, may realizing bubble gotten big enough burst. close said bubble without losing friends coming across judgmental process? (“Sorry, didn’t make cut redefined quarantine bubble! Also, I’ve seen Instagram stories, maybe pruning, too.” Please don’t take tack.)

Be polite courteous, firm. ask continue say you’re unavailable plans, let know time being, you’re extra cautious COVID-19 surge.

“It’s OK disagree others reacting responding virus, able say time being, it’s best interest family restrict gathering,” Hokeness said.

“You confident enough surround people like-minded trust comes approach pandemic,” added.

It’s important note you’re likely change people’s minds behavior lives broach conversation. need go safety spiel, you’re already excommunicating pandemic pod.

“At point pandemic, everyone formulated opinions [on safety risks], certainly try avoid confrontation,” Hokeness said. “Instead, suggest alternative ways staying connected using online platforms like Zoom FaceTime hang out.”

And let’s honest: You’ve probably observing members inner circle behaving daily lives social media. may come play you’re deciding who’s pod-caliber.

If it’s someone you’re normally close to, always reintroduce pod know they’re mindful guidelines.

If that’s case, sure candid, direct conversations you’re comfortable comfortable terms risks, said Amelia Aldao, psychologist anxiety specialist New York City. Find they’re uncomfortable with, too. pandemic pod serve every member’s needs.

“We different tolerance risks, varying health risk factors unique life circumstances ― instance, someone may living older parents,” said. “So, whether want bring people bubble, kick out, send bubble purgatory (i.e., quarantine join bubble), upfront, clear, also patient understanding people’s choices.”

For it’s worth, slipped recently let bubble get little big, you’re alone. Humans insatiable drive social connection also don’t well life uncertainties. alien territory us. Given that, Aldao thinks slipping risky behavior bound happen.

“When we’re anxious, tend fall pattern dichotomous thinking: see things black white, good bad, safe unsafe,” said. “Entertaining shades grey ‘maybes’ tends fuel anxiety. There’s comfort extremes.”

When started forming pandemic pods, began label people “safe” without necessarily challenging assumptions. precautionary conversations COVID-19 unlike “safe sex” talks terms awkwardness. It’s easier assume someone cautious vigilant have.

“I think became easier simply assign people label ‘safe’ carry on,” Aldao said.

The therapist added we’ve done people we’ve deemed unsafe. many articles read bemoaning young people’s active social lives midst pandemic? may presumed true Gen Z-ers family.

But regardless lax others may gotten recent weeks, time clamp down, ask questions, generate thoughtful alternatives also kind patient others.

“Will easy conversation? No. awkward? likely,” Aldao said. “But, end day, want socialize people care understand needs.” party slogan, **Democrats care people ⓡ** Doesn’t Sweden like 10,000,000 people? means 5% Swedish population infected. Unreal. doubt. Got keep guy narrates reality alive.

Personally, research (wet lab cancer research) got absolutely wrecked year. slightly slower Moderna vaccine, immunity kick five weeks now

Where information come from? sell site cheaper 

VitalPPE.com can't one used seeing 'record numbers infections' reports literally re-read title 😅   

Let's keep going vaccinations, because, unfortunately, there's enough sane, caring people curb cases way. takes 5-7 days first dose nearly full immunity mRNA vaccines (I've seen data AZ). 20-40 days time actually see numbers. 

Colorado releases enough data try pin exactly (eventually), preliminary results look extremely good.  I'm 30 years old, it'll get mine, unfortunately. Wish quicker rollout. Cool place live, wifi, phone... Didn’t say count includes weekend well? Apparently tracking isn’t updated weekend numbers hit Monday. Wouldn’t make increase per day seem larger actuality? interpreting incorrectly?

“Because CDC states don’t report weekend, Monday’s tally includes catch-up prior days.” Doctor: “we aren’t seeing sick patients”

lol might want check r/oldrecipies. love cookbooks like Grandma's. time. can’t wait nightmare over. Interesting. Aren’t numbers usually lower Mondays? weekends? hope get decent vaccine confers personal protection.

Though last 18 months pertussis/tetanus vaccine side effects whatsoever knows. article points it. Psychologically much much harder mourn faceless number individual. don’t personally know anyone who’s died it, may profound effect health care workers one looking people old age homes major vector infection getting vaccinated important old people. rip scam? thing people looking for?

Yeah, husband gonna look like idiot ask him. IE thought would true mostly saying opposite. much difficult vaccinate people places. 

If give vaccines average 65+ year old person, lines would going multiple blocks get it. Instead giving extremely old far, far less likely get it/want it. bring like 300 vaccines 300 elderly 120 might take it, wait wait try get others take it, never 1- used ""actual positivity rate people actually tested"", 6.94%

Read wrote. ""Using Approach 4 data CDC, ND positivity rate 6.94% (let's say 7%). applied 3x rate entire pandemic, would 21% (I'm aware little higher rate definitely 3x early on).""

What saying take 6.94% multiply 3 get ""real"" positivity rate. That's works positivity rate determined empirically testing. percent positive entire population. percent positive number tests came ""literally saying 3x people actually tested COVID, COVID"", would saying 1.15M people COVID, 383k people actually tested.

I quite think grasping positivity rate is. number tested. 383k people test positive. So, I'm sure talking ""The way get higher positivity rate people actually infected."" - I'm trying produce higher positivity rate, I'm trying figure approximately many real infections been.

But that's literally did. said apply 3x factor positivity rate. think provide math behind reasoning, I've using data CDC 6.91% figure: 94.8k positives 1 411k tests also numbers ND website.

From September late December, highest daily positivity rate 18.5%. That's maximum. time, approximately 80,000 infections. 3x80,000 would 240,000 infections. based unique individual testing using JHU's positivity rate. 0.185x = 240,000. x = 1,297,297 unique individuals would need tested. 6%, 0.006x = 240,000. x = 4,000,000 unique individuals would need tested. 25.5% little 2x official number COVID cases (194k vs 94.8k). crazy people estimate total closer 3x.

One ballpark state population would need tested, isn't. 865,000 unique people tested 2x rate. Population ND 762,000. 3x yields 1.27 million. again, going CDC's IFR assumes 40% cases asymptomatic know around 20% asymptomatic. like speaking language everyone else.

Yeah, seems like I'm actually looking numbers rather making things based old outdated data beginning pandemic testing apply 8% extra today's official count, we're 1460 deaths use lower figure 0.6% IFR, we're 243k actual infections - 2.6x official number cases. look back, saying 2.6-3.0x start, maybe little off, sure.

But would faulty logic attributing excess deaths COVID know that's case. 

Try instead, use IFR 1.15 see compares serological testing data shows 10.7% population SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Perhaps optimist early tell - something.. unusual happening hospitalization data. Cases continue rise (and positivity rates places well, testing) hospitalizations started inflect. 

Hospitalizations jumped far today practically flat. slope 7-day moving average lowest since October past two days. types inflection points rare data, inflection quite significant. believe good chance may see week overall peak hospitalizations COVID.

While could chance perhaps hospitals across country finally reaching full capacity (or may bad state data somewhere, although see anything unusual), optimistically believe result vaccinations starting impact exactly sort disconnect would expect it. race rising cases percent highest-risk populations vaccinated. expect correlation cases hospitalizations continue weaken coming weeks. super exciting. fail see distribution age vs occupation going speed things up. southern Texas, I've experienced similar situation. sex store absolutely unafraid enforce ""over nose mouth"" policy grocery store little bit less restrictive... I'm surprised emphasizes important education here... Kind of, answer bit reactionary. vaccine isn’t really like drug shuts similarly interferes protein cascade, way show novel antigen immune system. process immune system adapting generate immunity natural. don’t ‘know vaccine kids’ it’s question ticking box effectiveness. give vaccines kids time, immune systems see form immune memory. 2.1 million doses unused California. million dollar question post comment removed

However, let’s real here. UBI never happen Democrats never allow programs replaced. 1, they’ll argue social support system still needed provide food/shelter stupid enough immediately blow UBI drugs/gambling/etc., eliminating benefits process. also never support concept eliminating minimum wage (also important actually work). Finally, UBI obviously completely incompatible open borders Democrats never give on. Basically, it’s never going happen.

Awesome 😎 Yesterday new vaccinations estimated infections first time. probably check information telling people wrong. Vaccines approved people 18, gives us new number ~210,000,000. We've already 23,000,000 cases 10% population, chances lower actual number cases probably includes number people 18, lets say 10%. leaves us needing vaccinate 65% people 18 136,000,000 people reach 75% conservative estimate needed herd immunity. 1.25 mil per day puts us 109 days vaccinating everyone one doses initially, booster available Biden admin proposing frankly damn good idea. 109 days today April 30th, would amazing. Realistically probably face hurdles, get public board getting jab numbers increase wicked fun summer America year.  Actually sounding alarm serious respiratory illness yet named hit enter thought “hrm.... many get this? many hope I’ll bet!” I'll send venmo. There's beautiful bridge I'm Brooklyn I'm sure interested buying. Gotta love dodger fans *pharmacy*? fuck? God I'm glad live somewhere takes seriously. isn’t going vaccine available kids adults must mandated take vaccine contribute herd immunity. don’t know Homecountry many Places Victims die alone unable Parents Family Members.

Sometimes can’t even wash see (post-mortem) first case China discovered beginning December. end December, doctors found new disease comparing multiple cases. According date illness, patient ill November. Therefore, Chinese doctors sound alarm November 2019. flip side - perhaps optimist - hitting nursing homes absolute game changer given accounts third deaths. 

It early tell, something.. unusual happening hospitalization data. Cases continue rise (and positivity rates places well, testing) hospitalizations started inflect. Hospitalizations jumped far today practically flat. slope 7-day moving average lowest since October past two days. types inflection points rare data, believe good chance may see week overall peak hospitalizations COVID.

I came contact Covid positive person last Wednesday. don’t think considered close contact CDC guidelines **Its literally #2 sub.** upvote complainers sub annoying, way worse type person sub miles Scientists future going ball analysing pandemic world's response, especially western countries evidence vaccine prevent spreading it? Last saw still unclear  crying watching video? Dangit! true hospitals can't know get hold back second dose. side effects? sick, stay home. worry state won’t get together. guidelines say vaccine 75% healthcare workers moving forward. Since 60% won’t, frozen can’t move forward. priority system really working well. Let’s get damn shots people arms stop worrying million dollar fines give “wrong person“ shot. getting flu shot last couple years, first 20 nah, mean yearly colds, got particularly bad ones would feverish vomiting week, never bothered testing would send home antibiotics. don’t know fall probably never experienced bad flu. warm weather also aide lowering COVID numbers well. vaccine + warm weather things improve dramatically spring. happens Spring determine restrictions continue throughout Summer, we'll wait Fall. major pressing question unfortunately, wait time answer. I'm hoping Summer normalcy, I'm expecting Fall. would get 65% efficacy rate vaccine cheaper vaccines high --95% efficacy rates? Unbelievable. don’t isolate flu symtoms Asia, that’s mask wearing became thing first place. I’d rather talk lol.

As far I’m concerned, Reddit doesn’t even exist real world. don’t tell people you’re Reddit, don’t even speak it.

It’s like #1 rule Fight Club — don’t talk it. stopped long time ago heard it’s rare 

I throw bags wash hands. Flouting, flaunting. 


But yes, disheartening.  Except everyone denied covid existed first place refused wear masks shame walk holiday like GoT. National shame walk holiday everyone gets day off. Thought control.

If let positivity through, might make people act irresponsibly make things worse.

It doesn’t matter it’s true not, worst news best controlling people’s behavior. goes public shaming non-compliant behavior.

Of course, there’s science back up. It’s feeling particular mob shares. Ban wet markets change presidency affect this? People say common Asian countries never Asia. Sometimes tragedy realize damage reflect. Right fire still raging. Florida change mobility pattern. California (because lockdown). Florida going long wave (probably longest that's seen) that's already going 4 months leading peak. California's typical 3 month wave. Got first one today! wrong content? hell people upvoting guy asking provide source? everybody around complete morons? thought common knowledge CDC came recommendation vaccine priority states could choose follow (which did) not. questions came vaccine prioritization 1 SOURCE. CDC report came it. else would source be, fucking National Enquirer? old fragile look several different ways though. need healthy. need drs nurses that. also need food; need grocery workers that. on. said, think prisoners one last priority vaccinated upset getting vaccinated? Absolutely not.

Also, it’s worth argument likely die illness? Older people/immune compromised look ages lose prison system. fall categories, sure vaccinate away! 

But think thing grinds personal gears criminals front teachers constantly exposed kids day everyday many older high risk conditions seen one hardly caring stereotypical “think children response” that's bollocks. everyone know steering well clear doctors hospitals. result putting CVS Walgreens charge, though? two saying they'll everyone care facilities vaccinated end month. Meanwhile, WV (who's using independent pharmacies) already finished first round care homes. feel like could train someone day two properly administer shot. difference, Florida supermarket offered $10 gift card getting flu shot them. Took 5 minutes waiting. would like mean way out. Repubs said Obama. remembers ""Obama ant christ"" stickers? Repubs refuse acknowledge majority people agree policies. call mob rule. people? want become popular need popular policies, rely old system awards power landholders. comments probably get removed though. That's...uh...that's *east*. people even allergic things indoors US : underfunds program

People: see, government terrible anything Hmmm ? always thought ""rare"" meant ""rare"" English. Let's call *death* severe shall ? John's Hopkins Corona Virus Cases 90,873,878/Deaths 1,944,561 Case Fatality rate ~2.1%

Approximate number coronavirus vaccines delivered date, global: 29,000,000. Reported fatalities ZERO. Case fatality rate ZERO

We certainly dealing two different definitions ""rare"" here. unaware language Zero considered 2 million. one collected linguists world unaware ? great. hope schools workplaces implement similar policies. really, headline misleading counts multiple days, higher reporting cdc, adds states previously report new today.  Haha. speak experience... think funny people talk single digit percent chance ""long COVID"" six months like death sentence. Yet crowd can't acknowledge year+ absolute shit mental health entire demographic society drawback this.

I'm even asking anyone claim mental health important anyone's life. not. However, able list bad mental health outcomes downside restrictions. People tendency want build argument, ignore everything goes it. Like, people I'm side here, acknowledge COVID-related problems, going arrive decent solution society. Sending National Guard prevents coups. send them. Ok long shot anyone know there’s research yet around whether vaccine antibodies transfer via breast milk?  got mine work hours ago. Im Felling relived, hopefully go back way things covid. English speakers spell z. sure point going way put portuguese spelling words English conversations.

Imagine someone saying ""Pleasure meet you, I'm Nihōn"". saying ""Ciudad del Mexico"" English conversation. Think lot sooner that. 200M 400M shots, 300M half J&amp;J. 140 days June 1. that’s 2M day, 3M. long would take portion US actually get vaccine 1st dose? 480 actually, take count 1.25 actually 3 days. Aaaaaaaaaaaand cried night elected. Finally, good movement right direction. ""You're literally saying 3x people actually tested COVID, wrote made absolutely sense trying point obvious.

What wrote make sense. 3x number people tested, despite testing negative, actually create hypothetical scenario would estimate positivity rate infections found, ie. ""what-if"" scenario, means end want. trying say higher positivity rate end.

But again, something empirically determined can't hypothetical. That's working backwards try massage data fit math works expecting 240k cases one day.

It works period time well works 1 day. Again, 18.5% maximum. rest days lower. 18.5% would MINIMUM population size easily reach 30%+ population infected (240k cases) without testing 100% population.

Mathematically, positivity rate, can't. Again, unique individual tests. multiple tests person, yes, could. unique individual tests. example hypothetical state pop=100, number tests n=20 every period argument's sake, re-test every negative individuals previous period:

This work run unique individual tests day 5 assuming testing different group people 5 days. maximum number positives 5%, i.e. daily positivity rate. scenario, reached 30% entire population tested positive, 10% positivity rate every day 49% entire population tested.

Again, testing people multiple times. That's unique positivity rate. positivity rate 5% specifically re-test people multiple times arithmetic [positivity rate] * x = [number infections] let say x = unique individuals tested.

The positivity rate unique tests. find positivity rate non-unique tests slightly lower 16.03% maximum period time. sake trying get lowest minimum possible number population, I've used highest positivity rate. get it? register anywhere?  Well, things little differently Reddit. subs, It’s let arguing who’s right sharing ideas. looks like reaction might place anger. get it. There’s ton stuff going CDC definitely expert disease. clamoring cure. 


Everyone wants go heaven one hurry get seems tacky say Loss angeeless Coloradou actually speak spanish.

So say Spanish pronunciation speak spanish go way misspell mispronounce words speaking English.

If frenchman pronounces ""Paris"" native pronunciation speaking English, they'd sound pretentious hell.

Same thing Italian insists saying ""Venezia"" speaking English. Either they're superpowered mafia hitman. *data math literally presented*

“All number schmumbers hooey! follow *science*^TM”

From us scientific community, please go back school. come feels like everyone know saying take vaccine... Gives hope numbers climbing, care country in. Easy enough boycott them, since reason stop anyway unless want get gas near house. people read flaired user posted summary confusion title. click guy obviously knows everything read me. think vaccine protects recipients, don’t yet data prevents recipients transmitting. Please correct I’m wrong. kids don’t vaccine, can’t still need masks, social distancing? Yes, teachers adults would protected complications, don’t think expect COVID disappear school Fall. take steps progressing (many schools yet reopened) won’t giant leap (reopening *and* without safety measures). dust, dust mites, heck even outdoor pollen gets inside even winter somebody help here: news? ""unused"" doses get used sooner later, yeah? like article saying ""1 million doses Florida thrown away gone waste""

The doses used yet. long providers store proper temperature, get used. say vaccination effort going slowly, say wrong. simply saying ""medicine unused"" strike legit news story see soon, unfortunately. impact

What QoL? 90 year old nursing home gets 5 extra years nursing home vs 20 year old 50-60 years ahead them, possibly ""long covid"". total QoL argument two cases IMO favour vaccinating 20 year old.

Regardless, nobody wins vaccines sitting unused freezers. Wonder # going jump Biden takes count :/ ie closely aligns w excess deaths. Thats months psychological warfare media people.

They convinced people virus extintion lvl event shit like that, sad actually. (as long reasonable amount/level) - last thing want bad norovirus around workplace right now. Spelling talking, spelling bee? Screw nukes, worry calvary... 1,250,000 sounds like damn impressive number, realize would still take 2021 get everyone rate. impossible predict.

If everyone keeps social distancing st current rates, additional 20% immunity could drive down.

If people start socializing more, could keep rising months.

More importantly, though, see hospitilizations deaths drop pretty soon older folks higher priority groups. Newsom disaster. still know anyone personally voted him, guy kill predecessor combat something? He's like living embodiment everything modern American left hates: obscenely criminally rich, white, hilariously well connected due family influence, completely disconnected CA electorate, horrendously touch. parents let get it, do... You’re really bad understanding science. Whelp semi solid Vitamin department, deficient looking normal range would like get numbers bit more, guess consistent multivitamins get vitamin K well eat foods it. No. Every single time purchase stuff get free shipping fucking everything along free trial periods galore access every little fucking product could ever want best possible price, say “sucks you”. pretty bleak

It's really not.

People act like hospitals ""running out"" doses big deal, expected.

We capability administer wayyy vaccines supply for, need limit numbers appointments keep things stable.

Quebec gets around 50,000 vaccines week. could give couple days wanted to, could take slow give enough use supply exact moment next shipment arrives.

It terms public health ways exactly same. former inefficient staff planning. reason people called ""slow start"" idea talking about. Morgan Stanley analysts believe it'll higher people expect, 80%+. wonder could possibly due oral transmission covid, especially family...that's interesting. Though oral transmission supposed nearly impossible afaik. U put trump comparison harambe. shut ur damn mouth nd call human sized goldfish like rest us looked cases deaths two respective states here?

Yes. California cases basically once. Florida long extended wave. Cases per capita similar. terms deaths, again, California deaths whereas Florida longer period time. Florida deaths per capita. think going possible California catch Florida terms deaths, least don’t like Florida politically California doesn’t look like it’s going positive direction Look case graph bottom California. see peak around December 18-20. see two peaks Christmas New Years acquired cases (January 2nd January 8th). Like clockwork. Given case count coming due restricted mobility 18-20 peak (ignoring outlier spike 17th, cases dropped ~17,500 18-20 peak December 30), cases continue downward trend. people thought do. Nah check inbox reddit much. intentionally open menu app. Mostly care people think. Man hell going California think children died COVID-19 roughly rate died chickenpox vaccinated it. 

Parents [*actively get kids chickenpox getting adult could way dangerous. Dust one common allergies it? vaccine super DUPER sites vaccines regular super sites. It’s also used decrease amount attention towards incorrect, misleading, misinformed information. searched ""Operation Warp Speed"" ""6.5 million"" can't find source claim. Agreed, it’s bit apples oranges. said, you’re simply looking “how effective shot I’m taking,” happily take usually less 60% every year. get 60% Covid vaccine early mid-March, 95% one May/June- serve J&amp;J. personal calculation sooner = better, even &lt; later. I’m 61 risk, that’s me. ... including kids sounds right, meaning wait year. especially considering worst case scenario assuming never get faster everyone wants one feel like I'm following game Plague Inc. point. Tell keep fat mitts needle away could consider fact position apparently think personally threatened virus pretty big reward vulnerable people get. weigh someone mortally worried virus would gone compared did, think would unfair maybe get something people bitching year ""sacrifice"" them. Also, never young sacrificing save elderly; we're going brutally honest, elderly people truly people threatened probably put restrictions. fact letting uncontrolled, potentially severe illness (which affect people working age significantly) go population potential negative effects far beyond us regular people would able foresee.

Either way setting exemptions vaccinated people would administrative nightmare probably happening anyway given hard government get anything put place, since we're talking hypotheticals still say mad wrong things. ones 95% effective already bought richer countries till next year. Indonesia vaccine orders AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, CanSino (all 80% effective) they're approved/still trials.  Fuck man hope. Can’t wait take daughter grandparents, even laws’ lol. canada understands hoard early supply manage distribute, rest world still needs vaccines stop wearing masks

there studies suggest Vaccination prevents transmission happened talk Canada buying like four times population help useless Americans? vaccinated now? tell freedompatriotbravewarriors.  They’re Spanish words, way Americans pronounce butchered, think person you’re respond fails realize that’s happens names cities. Might well smack face microphone jeez lol  San Diego turned petco park super vaccine distribution center, saw friends IG popping. Dakotas West Virginia getting much doses per capita everywhere else?  Remember it’s 2 doses would 228m people, full 330m Columbia  thing. would spelled same?  understand. apologize. Things little tense. Sorry. I’m getting it, good everyone planning get Pfizer released data, FDA ready give EUA 50% efficacy.  See that’s falls rails....”hey, us adults incompetent slap mask on! good first day kindergarten!”  Give break. think people nuts think that’s going fly. purpose preventing spread COVID? whole lot.

But general cleanliness? think people would welcome that. actually that. 260-270 million eligible adults. (16+ moderna 18+Pfizer) take physical safety seriously; spend highest percentage tax dollars military, DOD, law enforcement, guns home security nation, yet fatalistic comes health. Many people don’t take health seriously, don’t take many precautions avoid risk, hope practitioners medicine heal them/save them. not, “oh well, die something.”

People general don’t good means assessing measuring risk vs benefit; often compare risks unrelated events justify actions inactions. compare everything getting car accident, regardless unrelated events are, percentage completely avoidable vs unavoidable events. Gotcha. Completely mistook first post advocating opposite. agree stance then. it’s safe, it’s better nothing guess. ""Bold strategy Colorado, let's see pays em'."" prob? LOL, that's whole point article. post locked due lot thinly veiled misogyny. I’m American across border can’t tell often I’ve envied Canadians past year. know doesn’t help know hope things pick guys soon, know grass often greener side- matter side you’re show excess death charts, claim fake numbers facility area due proximity cave virus likely sourced.

Yeah thousand km away.  Worst economy? Wow, brain mush, isn’t it? old mental health argument. Tell many people died pandemic? doesn’t compare people dying one ass hats making fun peoples mental health months ago. Doesn’t want confuse Americans doesn’t seem effective enough worth doing.  [As 2019 UK 3.37 million people aged I’m hearing it’s shit show they’ll sometimes give whoever around. Hang there.   Right. The. Fuck. On. Sort of, except following restrictions carve path freedom restrictions. need much harsher restrictions that. US peak lockdown R0 ~0.8. would take years stamp COVID level.

We mad politicians taking action containable. mad people openly flout restrictions bad reasons, means us following restrictions make sacrifices keep check. However, think everyone following recommendations, still living semi-normal life, would result low prevalence COVID. disease spread mostly close friends family behind closed doors. generally need wait couple days data given day come in. words, numbers today (Monday 1/11) likely look lower sometime Tuesday Wednesday. possible construct sentences clearly enough.

The premises were:

Since prostitution illegal, sex workers victimized report crimes committed fearful repurcussions.

My response that, even decriminalized environment, certain victims still report crimes them. used 6 year stark example someone limited reporting abuse function law. could easily used 26 year old, even 86 year old, abused forced sex work example likely hit hard people easily understand pre-pubescent child *can't* consent believing adult *can*. fact, limits consent necessarily fall along age brackets we'd explore things gone wrong someone's life accurately assess whether factually consensual.

Some point studies prostitutes countries benefits decriminalizing behavior, examples tend ignore relatively robust social programs would buttress individual's choice engage kind work place choice along consensual spectrum. example, make much sense compare prostitution Netherlands US without also looking variables like gangs drugs (use/addiction/sales) respective society addressed them.

This notion decriminalizing prostitution basis individual women's rights ignores entire sectors industry--most troubling includes people can't often speak themselves. children adults trafficked sex industry tossing aside basis of, ""well that's one type crime whereas we're talking sex *workers*"" ignores whole range salient issues. fact, ignores central tenant critical theory would question ability unequal participants even come market equal grounds laissez-faire environment!

In short, sentence read as: ""decriminalization solve problem people reporting crimes done law primary barrier sex victims reporting violations.""

Just take one example often cited *some* advocacy groups: accurate think prostitutes abused law enforcement *because, because,* prostitutes. Certainly heightened exposure argue decriminalizing prostitution would somehow protect victimization hands law enforcement ignores lessons advocacy groups, BLM, tried highlight years fact law enforcement abuses position minorities *regardless* whether acting lawfully not. think herd immunity would fast...right?

I guess I'm going deep drive influenza boosters done. alternative get people truly risk vaccinated, keep pumping arms adults summer, Fall temperature checks doors less let rip schools. You’ll vaccine coverage community numbers say children low risk. 
Maybe reorganize rooms space better get creative ways. However, sound like anti masker know that’s it’ll interpreted, kids sitting masks rows learn. simply not.  culture anyway pretending result enormous problems already has. 

I don’t agree keep restrictions anybody point outside international travel like. would ask though: it’s unsafe kids school sans masks, world acceptable us adults world without masks, wouldn’t bring home kids? That’s intentionally bit loaded question. think statement Moderna beg question.  expecting “normal” Fall even 2022 we’re even going data kids 2022? need honest assessments think chances hold live like past summer rather slim, bordering non-existent.   Hormonal birth control absolutely cheap. pill sometimes, every woman take pill. can’t, interacts w mood stabilizer. use IUD implant, $300+ MINIMUM. 

The morning pill doesn’t always work. I’m asking little empathy American women don’t access universal healthcare. gonna take year vaccinate everyone. Ehhhhh! guys go minor league games! beers $12 instead $18!

But real local echl team $5 Budlight draft Fridays wonderful.  old  Yup, apparently early supply bought meant absolutely nothing. think weird bunch “domestic terrorism” (I guess new word it), shut downs trump president. like what, same
Say Biden gets elected suddenly world better? wonder coming next election cycle. don’t think people going see treat COVID daily represent serious vector risk? recall seeing data CDC compared options making recommendation. Vaccinating risk populations essential workers led ~4% lower death rate models (which probably highly precise), chose recommend essential workers keep economy running smoothly provide essential services, unable take many protective measures due work.

But bottom line, two options surprisingly similar. lot states chosen swap them, including Texas. feel like Trump's checked out, Biden taken already, unofficially. things speeding makes sense. Biden said, ""Do it."" 

I'm excited this. 102 year old grandmother finally got past Saturday, along 71 year old daughter, 70something year old caretaker. poor grandmother basically home caretaker nearly year. seen aunt uncle, that's it. It'll nice go things again, travel more.  real sense competition exists since US stockpiling resources.  leading world vaccine distribution. I'm getting first dose tomorrow! car, can't take public transit cuz covid. options walking work uber. safer less risky (ie less chance getting Covid)? Absolutely not, attempt create vaccine coronaviruses kids, didn’t go well. 
 “In late 1960s, children Washington, DC received RSV vaccine virus inactivated formalin. Eighty percent children given shot hospitalized severe respiratory disease, two died. Many scientists thought formalin responsible vaccine’s problems, chemical used safely vaccines.

For eight years, Polack team investigating vaccine caused illness, known enhanced respiratory disease, ERD. started examining tissue lungs two patients died, comparing effects vaccine RSV mice.

The problem, report month journal Nature Medicine, children’s antibodies binding strongly enough inactivated virus produce protective immune response. Instead, antibodies dragging dead virus them, triggering massive attack arms immune system.” downvoted made definitive statement, *it's not* definitive still spread virus getting vaccine.

No one knows still spread it.

Thanks posting.  thought boat got signed vaccinated pure nepotism. may get lucky.  isn’t debatable. CDC extensive modeling topic concluded vaccinating old people first save many lives. either listen science, make shit up. List susceptibility buy cars police auctions op relentless. We've gotten 20+ alts suspended point we're constantly adding automod stop shitty domains. honestly infuriating Reddit anything despite us complaining constantly. quite think grasping positivity rate is. number tested. **And 383k people test positive.** So, I'm sure talking here.

I KNOW! Jesus... That's *you* saying *I* saying...

""You're literally saying **3x people** actually **tested COVID**, **had COVID.**""

What wrote made absolutely sense trying point that's literally did. said apply 3x factor positivity rate. 

That's create hypothetical scenario would estimate positivity rate infections found, ie. ""what-if"" scenario, means end want. trying say higher positivity rate September late December, highest daily positivity rate 18.5%. That's maximum. time, approximately 80,000 infections. 3x80,000 would 240,000 infections. based unique individual testing using JHU's positivity rate. 0.185x = 240,000. x = 1,297,297 unique individuals would need tested. 6%, 0.006x = 240,000. x = 4,000,000 unique individuals would need tested. 

That math works expecting 240k cases *one day*. easily reach 30%+ population infected (240k cases) without testing 100% population. Here's example hypothetical state pop=100, number tests n=20 every period argument's sake, re-test every negative individuals previous period:

* Period 1: 1 positive, 19 negatives (total people tested: 20, total positives: 1)
* Period 2: 1 positive, 19 negatives (total people tested: 21, total positives: 2)
* ...
* Period 30: 1 positive, 19 negatives (total people tested: 49, total positives: 30)

In scenario, reached 30% entire population tested positive, 10% positivity rate every day 49% entire population tested.

It's specifically re-test people multiple times arithmetic [positivity rate] * x = [number infections] let say x = unique individuals tested. understand this. Canada boasting one first buy vaccines purchased 400 million doses. understand order different vaccines different companys, going way slower led on. Rare say? Kind like getting severe case virus. mean hope stop seeing girlfriend year long distance (which sounds like not). Ah okay, makes lot sense. Hey hard labour honest life. Don’t lump crime. People lazy Bloomberg reporting weekend. 1.25 million day. 8 million Monday morning, 7 something Sunday/Saturday. downvoted wrong, especially US. know LOT people stayed home, quickly move family crash friends happen year's worth rent, utilities food money savings live stayed home. Several people know evicted late rent. lot nonessential workers go back working order survive. sucks REALLY would help people staying home, wish realistic option people help slow spread. realize birth control abortions expensive hell right? what’s goal here? fair? prevent deaths? Yep. matter would help them. sympathize loneliness, entitle sexual intimacy. Party buses go apartment nights little lemon orange peel. Boom - Vit.C. :D Older people/at risk people continuing isolate ideally able get people providing care likely able pass virus since vaccinated. sure hell be.

Let’s say vaccine isn’t available children mid 2022. making sacrifices then. 

I won’t *think children*. Preventing cases also leads less deaths. 1984 style, nice. know I've ever read entitlement life.

This 'normality' get go back byproduct healthiness vaccine saves lives.

Thus saying ""I’ve sacrificed make sure people don’t die get hurt em masse"" makes literally sense weighed 'health others vs. entertainment yourself' clearly choosing entertainment...

The point COVID relief stop people dying getting severely ill, go back baseball games. respond made garbage?

“The priority queue sorted likelihood given immunization positively impact overall pandemic.”

How read fucking report don’t make bullshit? actually showing rare person exists. stating see people public make wild assumptions use examples teach people made ideas. know them. know financial situation.   agree. ways masking political, ways it’s education.

My family members considered “blue” ones don’t comply masking always think either illogically emotionally.

They either go: “we’re sick, don’t need wear masks” get really offended asking put distance it’s personal attack.

Even still, keep putting dirty cloth mask wear chin diaper. point never computes. Given manufacturing ability...wouldn’t simply enough doses available limiting people holding needle? Quite small means shit kid lucky enough bad statistic. I've gotten extremely rare reactions counter drugs. lose gambling games participate. 1 year planned socialization feasible. guess deter people breaking rules? good enough.

That's awesome man. someone fermenting food past decade careful much good thing bad. definitely found hard way, easily throw balance.

Man going go Rams first game there. yall go vaccines snap pics me! cited [their argue Dad jabs now. one concerned this, makes happy. Don’t mad, heard America charging people $2,700 per shot. reprehensible. wouldn’t everybody wear them? That’s we’re elderly now, isn’t it? sudden would kids?

Really asking. said “kids keep wearing masks” everybody. Well smells like rotten eggs, could natural gas leak! could explained new strain, new strain would equal like 95% cases, since surge massive.

However new strain anywhere near that, must causes. Prolonging pandemic get life back fully agree, know close acquaintances plan keep masks around incase. even cold flu big C, reason spread shit around absolutely need leave house. bring USA thread Denmark? get two seconds imagine might world beyond USA?

Also, USA 1/5 population China. Chinese people go visit parents New Year people living USA. Logistically simple. wrapped matter days most. Show sino medical study anything COVID can't pick apart want talk. Consistently bad science bad. great parent. best choice. People willing risk children dice roll says it'll unlikely roll snake eyes gambling lives shouldn't. I'm tossing dice either.  it’s revenge AIDS small bump money owed Feb, big bump money owed March, hence two deadlines. probably waiting till March regardless. small bump money worth seeing big strides hopefully making February! are, course, 100% right. I'm lucky situation wait -- still frustrating done everything right yet, people rolled right holidays without seeing friends family. 

It's frustrating uncontrolled spread high math works favor vaccinating people comorbidities high-contact individuals grocery store workers, airport workers, etc -- would lower chances people like us getting it, even we're far vaccination list. 

Sure, I'm young healthy, still want risk getting it, know people long term complications. yet accepted compare Western countries Europe America NZ Taiwan started reading headline freaking out. 

I hope lives long long time. Joe Biden 76 years old, he’d probably getting anyways. post news that’s 8 months old? definitely need take appropriate amount time study make sure vaccines dangerous, absolutely traded *certainty* many deaths waited trials play *possibility* finding adverse side effect trials.

One lessons learn next pandemic make trials move even faster time. One year really ""warp speed"" compared previous vaccine development, eternity us actually living it.

If another pandemic happens anytime next 20-30 years, people willing repeat happened 2020, even assuming somehow nearly perfectly-competent government running show.

Two things think of:

- centralized recruitment drive volunteers vaccine trials. Moderna started Phase III trial July, fully enrolled October. take long find 30,000 people 330,000,000. soon first Phase trial planned, government put call 1,000,000 volunteers standing ready stages trials, vaccine manufacturer.

- find enough volunteers, need run challenge trials. depends severity disease - something nearly 100% fatal like Ebola, really want run challenge trials. something like COVID-19, know really ""just flu"" vast majority people 55, perfect opportunity give low-risk participants *choice* whether want participate challenge trials. tradeoff efficacy data heavily weighted towards low-risk profiles, even release young healthy, slow overall transmission enough prevent hospitals overflowing. wasn’t top list?! think going nearly impossible locate actual ""patient zero"".  too. Fair enough easier say. 501.V2 variant prefer “Vader’s Fist Variant” ya know.... 501st legion Star Wars 🤷🏻‍♂️ Yep, early mid February start seeing benefit go pretty quick say people supposed aquire masks? week day  ever slightly conceivable risk factors causing women afflicted fibromyalgia, ME/CFS, etc., whatever are, would also make susceptible long

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, panhandle Florida bad place general.  time get vaccine weather starting get nice, good beaches. It’s 0% too.

50,38% global effectiveness, 78% effective weak symptoms 100% effective mild serious symptoms.

São Paulo’s government fucked announcement “50,3%” quoted everywhere without details. Sorry ignorance, long lockdown? I’m sorry, you’ve clearly put effort understanding stuff (at cursory glance analysis appears well-researched rational), think got crossed somewhere missing something substantial (and don’t time figure I’m lunch hour). Based information you’ve outline above, doesn’t appear need vaccine (it seems like stating vaccines almost impact projected deaths next months?). point effort vaccine development? gotta missing something. counting flu cases COVID 19 cases. world recovered COVID 19 countries struggling. Remember flu corona virus known benefit vaccinating 65+ plus 18-29 year olds. goal is.

Absolutely not. 
  
That's goal known benefit, looks like risk hospitalization death chart.   Stop trying justify selfishness. 

What's selfish trying understand best stratergy... rather blindly pointing numbers actually give answer? trying debate me. strawman every post made. suggest mass polio vaccinations would good idea 2021? didn't. smallpox. 

Measles used infect millions per year. 30 people get infected, makes national news. death rate fraction higher, due selection bias, e.g. kids getting likely immune compromised, since virtually children vaccinated it. Going 3-4 million cases per year generally less 50 cases per year result clear need explaining. 

The danger current pandemic clearly demonstrated. head sand see that. suggesting everyone world get vaccinated Japanese encephalitis, someone arguments might apply. there's question infectious COVID is, exposed go without vaccination long enough. ""roughest"" vaccine we've ever produced stop pandemic still order magnitude safer COVID infection. 

The COVID vaccines made currently technologically advanced point human history. go assume worst we've ever made, still exponentially safer vaccinated getting COVID, even low-risk age group comorbidities.  personally care about. mind getting sniffles sure frig want lungs dissolve Wait though, 50% effective infections, 78%+ severe disease? would acceptable. Increase taxes wealthy.

Have landlords vacant homes pay penalty.

Provide basic UBI

Those alone help get things right track  Based r U saying this? going better USA??? evidence vaccinated individuals cannot contract asymptomatic infections transmit others. careful. That’s fair point- early surge China showed overwhelmed hospitals.

It’s probably hard know much result characteristics medical system, knowing “new pneumonia” spreading, intentional ostrich Chinese governmental entities. would seem pandemic underway hospitals worked increase surge capacity, harder overwhelm them. Obviously upper limit that, COVID raging everywhere additional difficulties preventing system overwhelmed.

Still - good food tgought 2021 stay fuck away documentary grandpa. idea terrible, hard data level protection given single dose. government needs stop sitting hoard let vaccination sites handle holding second dose. Otherwise end population incorrectly vaccinated accomplished nothing. fact diagnostic test long COVID distinguishes temporary post-viral syndrome mean exist, mean needs renamed.

And engaging arguments made CFS, fibromyalgia gulf war syndrome. likely never pin accurately enough deterministic single symptom simple diagnostic test sufferers ever able conclusively prove they're sick. study even worth using toilet paper

Wish would known trying, shit phone. 100 million around 30 percent country case likely catch spread current setup. good start. hope so. course I’ve staying home alone time almost year wear masks whenever enter business, fucking hate masks.  sciencealert.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Trump office yet. he's gone, everyone change moods something bad happens..... they'll blame Trump lol California like “sooo anything do?” basically actual first world countries get Canada bit production capacity margins? Similar experience friend. 20, nobody else family displayed symptoms quickly lose home.  People seem think it’ll data wedding scheduled Memorial Day weekend whole pandemic started comment gives hope!! cannot tell much I've stressing this.  don’t need every single person subcontinent vaccinated. ones prone serious health issues: older adult population vaccinated everyone else anyways. death rate starts dip pretty much know we’re clear. That’s true, never thought many prime testing thing even widespread—good point. Northeast we’ve lots districts going hybrid. seem know talking about. article almost month ago, bet they're coming around. Cases don’t really matter. truly idea many cases this.

It’s death rate hospitalizations matter. Yeah live NJ Covid symptoms back March (slight cough, sore throat, extremely bad headaches, congestion, heaviness chest, reduced lung capacity, swollen lymph nodes neck) get tested. Luckily symptoms bad fine month, really think it. Weird thing nobody else house got sick. me, I'm 23 years old healthy.

My friend's family (NJ too) also got rly sick March, get tested. doubt we're almost million cases state tbh. Okay. went looked up. Seems like there’s middle [a majority U.S. Christians (54%) say homosexuality accepted, rather discouraged, personally advocate less government minority around echo chambers.   Ows made 6.5 claim. 

Track doese here. think people thinking ""bad news"" he's calling number question. states update twice week, even includes lag. Bigger numbers better smaller numbers, course, number tell us vaccinations *per day* right anyway.

The best thing look rolling 7 day averages, basically every state reported least really know. think we're right around million day right now, based numbers skyrocketing, headline really tell us that. fair Whitmer, request wasnt now. point March. lot schools already open. many health care gotten covid already, I'd probably decline gotten covid prioritise others unless prohibited something like travelling another country Anyone else notice symptoms quite different CDC?

9 family members acquaintances caught COVID (and obvs tested positive) past month, including 76 year old grandmother 75% lung function developing stage 4 lung cancer, also immunocompromised due chemotherapy...

Out 8 people, one anything stomach illness (cramps, diarrhea, general stomach unwellness), weird me, that's listed 'uncommon' symptom, symptom 9 people (from 4 different blood lines) developed.  good source/site distribution plans? Genuinely curious shipment actual queueing tracking people acting like happened today? Reporting consistently lagging several days, like testing places report daily, weekly, many report weekends, etc. 

1.25 Million vaccinations REPORTED today. Sure might happened one day much likely happened several days. Soon they're gonna run bad news upvote! Let's go Dodgers, let's go! 2 data points enough say anything significant, could easily outlier data fully submitted etc. I'd give least 2-3 weeks significant changes data since time taken vaccine immunity take hold around 2 weeks iirc would imagine watching live feed loved one suffocating death able near would traumatizing. Regardless age. Canada spread out? ever seen Wyoming? Montana? Idaho? US spread Canada. True story. years forgot renew drivers license mail person. called DMV ask day go. told ""go Friday, ""Good Friday"" line short."" waited 4 hours anyways. Nordic Model equivalent buyer powdered sugar arrested, cocaine dealer freely go police paid counterfeit money. might see get vaccinated February March Florida June/July here. want actually summer year. gonna like fucking freight train. pick speed we're golden. Especially Biden invokes DPA hands deck. Gotta love people complain literally every single government-run agency claim answer improving society intrusive government. moderators removed comment supporting masks social distancing? believe 51 questions ask it’s felony skip turn. Yeah already know that. didn’t need either explanations. 

Last spring politicians promising bills covid related care would covered. 

They haven’t honored that. 

I’m bringing China actually honor country not. Finally. 

There much speculation vaccines given due healthcare professionals declining vaccine. reality many work clinics, pharmacies, healthcare settings outside hospital settings able get vaccine. May “noise” day data-wise. Averages probably increasing throughout week next. Also metro areas (Los Angeles) drs sending people home even admitting due overcrowding. Oh, ffs. course people causing slowdown ones get vaccine, wear mask, wash hands taking shit. Let's go Dodgers, let's go! OWS projecting that. makes sense. project shot workers limiting factor. Wait, proof employment? many seniors retired? can’t keep industries closed 2022-23. It’s realistic government support people long (look little they’ve done now). Agree need vaccinated need give others chance earn living we’re creating bad situation even worse. good chance won’t even vaccine kids 2022+. get Grandma Dad shot day 1 it’s available 75 crowd?! I’m upstate told scheduling starts 4 pm today sister called exactly 4pm schedule Mom. sat hold 2.5 hours 6:15pm, hung on. local pharmacy link schedule broken immediately ultimately crashed traffic. sincerely hope distribution gets faster smoother day 1 go well us. I’m Californian clamoring Newsom’s removal. didn’t vote him, supported year think handed no-win situation Lockdowns became business vs health scenario. BUT, (and Governor/President), 9 months prepare plan set infrastructure vaccine rollout, completely botches vaccine. leader like (Governor President) deserve stay office. There’s still time fix this, man, immense resources hand, CA one top goal right now. Instead we’re laughing stock vaccines sit unused people continue die.  Meanwhile Canada taking sweet ass time like super long run-on sentence.... Let's say household vaccinated. Someone also vaccinated, flies another state. person still required quarantine? first dose vaccine starts showing high effectiveness symptoms day 10. famous famous [Moderna looks symptoms, infection. So, working backwards standard incubation time, starts protecting initial infection little 5 days (median time infection symptoms 5 days). 

In extremely elderly/feeble (nursing home residents), timeline showing symptoms hospitalization typically compressed. 

Someone vaccinated December 30th, exposed January 6th, would likely show symptoms today. elderly, may could mean hospitalization tomorrow. window vaccination impact - especially highest risk - shorter may first appear. 

Obviously dream state couple weeks second dose, data implies protection infection (not symptoms) starting soon 5-7 days first dose. That's Canada spread out. easy going one province next, tto tiny communities north province's. also trying get contact reservation communities, might bit spicy towards vaccinations government, lot still confused whole thing.

So ywah going slow, easy way get people Canada. science says COVID less deadly flu children. Public health science also says socializing getting quality education absurdly important longterm health outcomes.

The kids sacrificing adults. everyone resilient kids are, virus would big deal murder hornets. everyone get vaccinated

The *only* condition prevents people getting vaccinated severe vaccine allergy. 100% effective

It 95% effective. means risk *reduced* 95% now. CDC estimates covid IFR.

Now take numbers divide 20--that risk become. elderly, currently face 5% risk death, drop 0.25% (1 400). 20-49, IFR decrease 0.02% 0.001% (1 100,000). 

Once everyone offered vaccine effective, return normal. IMO, risks acceptable, point really fair make comments like ""We need cute little germ machines killing grandma grandpa."" post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's good point. New Zealand good example sure. Thanks!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* begs question .... mean look New York vs Florida nursing homes. many things help protect elderly like Florida send slaughter like Democrats New York did. 

What saying? saying open social distancing mask wearing matter “age integrated” elderly screwed matter what? don’t logically consistent point even basic level. even 5% chance get it, vaccine almost certainly prevent trip hospital/an ICU admission healthy family member mine developed symptoms 11 days contact.

In country, say take 14 days symptoms show (in rare cases), that's proving true. CA always slow everything governor. 580/680 interchange still construction? like 10 years moved away wasn’t finished. Maybe downvotes due tone delivery opposed content. Dat UK variant hiting Republic. think I’d like money back... Brasilian spelling Brasil Z? They're good kids. They've failed almost every adult country. they're resilient strong! 2020 - toilet paper shortages.

2021 - Harsh austerity sovereign debt crises. children, distance ""learning"" harmful COVID. Children young people sacrificing sake elderly vulnerable. world adults access vaccine, cure *is* far harmful disease. OP wants us pray best can... Good luck you! May Class Covid-19 inspire never define you! Write story! high ground? Yup, everyone sucks this, seems. stories I've seen covid victims news moving. 

But people can't deal putting human face numbers, they'll probably tune out. seem healthy, ok... That's funny cause got flu twice last year pretty much get every year. Fuck guess. Got June one year guess luck really bad. kind Arms Race get behind. Shots arms, is... J &amp; J would literally end single-handedly. Memorial Day biggest party weekend years *Today* hot garbage. one online communities I've finding enjoyment solace past months petty, upsetting little crises today - people cliqueish, disagreements boiling over, etc. I've struggling immensely getting absolutely work done, general, especially useless today. I'm sleeping well keep forgetting eat. I'm already antidepressants (which made huge difference - could so, much worse.) 75 plus means J J wins race. It’s light years ahead current approved vaccines, easier mass produce cheap.

Even data isn’t good still works. It’s another vaccine stockpiles ready go. lives saved. Give young fit, reduce spread. Wow good news thought vaccine took several weeks second injection confer maximum immunity? Given people receiving second shot, I'm tempted doubt vaccine relevant factor. forecast/prediction cases US started decreasing? Like many people vaccinated start see impact? anyone else get goosebumps reading this? damn makes happy. definitely tried fuck FDA but... entirely successful.

Can't wait gone stop shitting things up. understand first group simply healthcare workers direct patient contact people 65 whatever begin with.

Because ""direct patient contact"" kind data people hand. guy services computers hospital wards considered ""direct patient contact"", security guard shows one night week, doctor see patients often? 

Filtering people slowing things down. faster simply vaccinate everyone hospital payroll. recommended, people probably gonna follow it? BaWü writes one websites soon vaccines available, GP's also able/allowed vaccinate know are, entirely possible capacity rules different. 

But state, grocery stores limited 50% capacity, basically none ever enforcement. Looks bad, right? Except capacity buildings WAY higher think - large store, capacity easily 2000+. Stores near done research determine busiest ever period found still small fraction currently allowed capacity (around 300 people time busiest day 2019, iirc). also cameras set count many come in, means something change sudden exceeding capacity, could install someone count.


So, likelihood, stores near meeting requirements. seems like lot people, capacities huge start with. 62% good enough reach herd immunity considering number people vaccinated. I've wearing pretty much since march 20, never owned cloth mask. ten pack basement ordered online widely available. already prepared started read short title name included it’s also important distinguish first dose doses especially US places go giving first dose get many people possible. 95% you’ve doses.

17% Israel’s new critical patients first dose. They’ve seen 33-50% reduction cases people first dose. Three members congress received first dose contracted COVID 19 recently presumably time sheltering capitol riot.

The risk still quite high haven’t second shot you’re at-risk group. Lol. Crazy everybody barely noticing this. doom gloom sub entire time. Positive news well ""differing opinions"" quickly squashed. I'll surprised comment get removed mods. Mine either ... zero explanation given ""currently hospitalized"" figure pretty consistent predictable. inflection significant. US, single state reporting properly throw things much. fuk vaccines. Trump stuff ass? Also people eat whole foods multivitamins also going engage healthy behaviors, whereas deficient may unhealthy habits explain worse outcomes. curiosity, similar sequences OC43 SARS-CoV-2? Could PCR possibly even antigen lateral assays incorrectly pick one other? “Happiest Place Earth” thing getting serious! Germany around 50k per day, it’s embarrassing article garbage. call local health department find out, look social media. information. western nation except Australia Locked way China did, though: sudden extremely strict limitations movement. able slow outbreaks, prevent seeding new ones. state US could lock hard wanted to, nothing preventing people could deciding leave area, fact telework reduced ties lived. Cuomo refused lock knew people would this, 180 demanded entire country lock him, threw fit state tried keep new yorkers out. first lockdowns high compliance, people quickly realized locked problem reached yet. time did, stopped caring. suggest alternative treatment, implies worse outcomes patients deficient Vitamin K D. 

Giving someone Vitamin K may improve outcomes, isnt study suggests. likely person diet/lifestyle higher vitamins yields better outcomes. shots come free set Mickey ears? Yea still big American company, naturally put lot trust them. Actually much safer herd immunity. though?

The one good thing Trump admin vaccine development procurement. 

Trump put military charge logistics planning funded Moderna vaccine heavily. 

The NIH (Dr. Fauci's team) intimately involved whole process developing vaccine Moderna, including clinical trials. gave Moderna hundreds millions dollars pre-production doses.

Trump admin gave Moderna $500M open second Swiss facility partnership Europe Switzerland. 

They also gave billions dollars pharma companies like Pfizer pre-produce millions doses without know would work.

These actions save countless millions lives alone. 

If ask me, America deserves get people vaccinated first. say Canadian. would people use need them? Florida given doses, people want them. Seems like pretty easy answer. Ship doses hold case.

And we're end ridiculous lockdown.  never want meet antisocial doomer shut-ins. Haha, really even bother read you. based speculation relevant parties release data. see that, 2 paragraph article, really difficult read. nightmare

Which one exactly? Yeah. think stated already quarantining anticipation positive test would follow. good person. happens congressperson. hell california Correct. would likely earlier higher case numbers. Interestingly majority us probably get less effective vaccine vulnerable likely get better one. 
[ABC reporting want start rolling Feb.](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-07/when-will-i-get-coronavirus-vaccine-australia-rollout/13039598) Close contact law enforcement tight quarters fellow members; mention hundred people screaming throughout halls. Seems logical think could related. mean dunno idiots think canada first world, US poor lot money canada vaccines makes sense we'd priority. Made SA exported wealthy. 

I read somewhere large portion Europe around 180% population covered. USA close 400% population covered. 

Poorer countries fucked. SA procured 1.5million doses 2 shot Pfizer vaccine. 

We population nearly 60million. 

What kind, rich larnies??? That's big ol' woooosh right there. That's true, hope vaccine prevent spread confirmed yet. That's vaccinating older populations tangent done. I'd bet going 90%+. secret mRNAs immunogenicity much method delivery fact stabilized spike protein 2-P proline mutations, ensures proteins displayed surface cell degrade post-fusion structure get much higher share neutralizing antibodies. also trickery Pfizer increasing effectiveness protein encoding.

Oxford kind screwed using wild protein, much 40% spikes degrade postfusion moment dendritic bind them. takes couple weeks vaccine actually offer amount protection infection, hospitalizations lag infections. I'd say pretty unlikely vaccinations making difference given people we'd vaccinated before, like, week. awful whole experience been, take certain amount delight species able look thing like this, go ""Well, seems really inconvenient. Let's just... Get rid that. better.""

And year later we're well way getting rid that. notified boss. work healthcare happened meatpacking plants Covid criminal. hope Biden administration conducts full investigation this. feel like months damn plan. Covid vaccinations big deal right now, heard. Pfizer vaccine developed Germany receive 'Operation Warp Speed' money Well need healthy pending civil war. relax der, eh getting statement? NIH currently recommend using Ivermectin COVID [this Ivermectin shown inhibit replication severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cell cultures. However, pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic studies suggest achieving plasma concentrations necessary antiviral efficacy detected vitro would require administration doses 100-fold higher approved use humans. probably missed obvious questions, like:

* constantly exposed lot people workplace?  
* children?  

etc. entire population US never quarantined, though. Interstate travel discouraged, barely. Mask usage required half states public gatherings 10-25 banned, except ones banned. thousands people going football games, like right now. sounds like trumpsters constantly claim ""the left-wing media makes election final result yet actually based facts 1/20"". mean ""it actually based facts""?

Almost like wasnt ""chaos"" like ""people learning distribute administer vaccine"" Contrary AZD1222 vaccine (which also AdV vectored) J&amp;J uses prefusion stabilized spike instead wild type (same mRNA vaccines). would surprised see 90%+ efficacy one well, even single shot.

I honestly can't understand Oxford go prefusion spike well... Splurge $30 3M p-100 concerned sealing. comfy way. M-95 much comfy surgical masks hot days. p-100 dream mask. Daily new positives haven’t peaked yet, meaning minimum 2-3 weeks away peak deaths history keeps repeating itself. states didnt go lockdown mask mandate get vaccines states fully vaccinated. colleges hard get students back incoming freshman They've confirmed wont till March mostly want testing. roll would require emergency proceedings government claims feel warranted given low case numbers. IL- Restaurants, bars, fitness classes, museums, movies, events 6 people, closed. Public school person 10 months. one thing open retail open 25% really need go clothes shopping never leave home. line get Target still. sucks. ""stay home advisory"" opposed ""stay home order"" since nov people change behavior without lockdowns, far late. lots family Florida, virus got bad started wearing masks, bad gather, masks, going back up.

Lockdown works everyone page, going direction. possible US. basically fucking nobody properly wearing masks, washing hands social distancing
