**What know AY.4.2, delta subvariant that's spiking cases U.K.** 
Matt Dunham/Associated Press 
The delta variant still overwhelmingly dominant coronavirus strain California U.S., one descendants starting gain traction overseas. 
Known AY.4.2, it‚Äôs rise United Kingdom. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former U.S. Food Drug Administration commissioner, tweet Sunday noted accounts 8% sequenced coronavirus cases country said ‚Äúurgent research‚Äù needed. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs clear indication it‚Äôs considerably transmissible, work quickly characterize new variants,‚Äù said. 
He experts, including Bay Area, keeping eye AY.4.2 ‚Äî offshoot AY.4, offshoot main ‚Äúparent‚Äù delta variant. 
As virus makes copies itself, small mistakes happen lead slight variations, result sublineages, said UCSF infectious disease expert Peter Chin-Hong. According variant tracker outbreak.info, delta variant 55 sublineages, including AY.4.2. 
In recent days, AY.4.2 ‚Äúalmost coming nowhere,‚Äù said Chin-Hong email. handful cases occurred U.S. far, something watch, said. 
Coronavirus Variants 
Is R.1 variant Bay Area? know highly mutated COVID strain 
Is mu variant California? know new 'variant interest' 
‚ÄúThe tempo thing going AY.4.2 moment,‚Äù‚Äô said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt much biological plausibility much damage.‚Äù 
According outbreak.info, seven AY.4.2 cases sequenced U.S. ‚Äî one California, San Diego County. others occurred Washington, D.C., Oregon, North Carolina Washington state. 
While AY.4.2 concern yet U.S., Chin-Hong said ‚Äúas long unvaccinated people, virus evolve need vigilant track variants sublineages.‚Äù 
The delta sublineage expanding U.K., according country‚Äôs Health Security Agency, accounting 14,705 sequences ‚Äî 7% 8% new sequenced cases there. contains two major mutations, A222V Y145H, spike protein, among variants monitored agency. 
In series tweets Friday, Francois Balloux, director UCL Genetics Institute London, said common delta sublineage AY.4, accounting approximately 70% COVID-19 genomes sequenced across globe. said AY.4.2 sublineage currently appears mostly confined U.K. ‚Äúremains exceptionally rare anywhere else.‚Äù 
While it‚Äôs ‚Äúobvious‚Äù candidate designation variant concern, indicating greater transmissibility ability escape immune system, said ‚Äúit feels worthwhile keeping eye it.‚Äù 
Chin-Hong also said experts don‚Äôt think AY.4.2 ‚Äúwill stickier transmissible, make vaccines monoclonal antibodies work less well, cause people become sick.‚Äù 
That‚Äôs way spike proteins work, said. enable virus latch onto human cell gain entry ‚Äî AY.4.2‚Äôs two major spike protein mutations aren‚Äôt place virus binds receptor, said. 
Chin-Hong said variants currently causing particular concern, added, ‚ÄúThere new variant created every two weeks‚Äù time tell another delta-like variant emerges. U.S. opening travel vaccinated foreign travelers starting Nov. 8 bring risk new variants sublineages, fully vaccinated people still able harbor coronavirus, said. 
‚ÄúThe virus continues shape-shift,‚Äù Chin-Hong said. ‚ÄúThe virus variants seem advantage prize increased transmissibility vaccine evasion. seem fitter battleground.‚Äù 
He said Bay Area‚Äôs high vaccination rates helped keep recent surge cases lower, ‚Äúlarge immunity force field least keep us bay months, longer.‚Äù 
Kellie Hwang San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: kellie.hwang@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @KellieHwang many, percent 12-18 year olds got Covid don‚Äôt vaccine get hospitalized? **""Great, long keep for?""**

I hear question lot. think like - imagine group cavemen begin realize sabertooth tigers entered isolated valley taken residence. Every week another member tribe ripped apart eaten tigers.

The decision made cavemen always carry spears, always travel war parties, children never leave safety caves close them. Everyone alert tigers. Nobody likes - want go frolic jungle like used to, swim river, pick berries gather fruits freely.

Some do, get ripped apart screaming get eaten.

The cavemen obey new rules, angry to.

""How long keep for?"" many tribespeople argue.

The answer, course, sabertooth tigers leave, die out, killed off, driven away. answer is: long takes.

Because stupid try pretend tigers there.

Because stupid try pretend covid kill people - maybe even someday, perhaps fifth sixth reinfection.

You keep - distancing, masks, vaccinations boosters, covid somehow ended longer threat.

""But can't live like that!""

Covid willing oblige sentiment. dare to. serious. gun head would quicker less horrible.

So, maybe *can* live. *Like that*.  like modern-day Lysistrata. love it. Sorry, whole idea ridiculous me. frustrated went concert? going concert would best method protection. stay separate rooms instead since offer protection? I'll honest, living someone 24/7 doubt mask going help whole lot, useful might certain situations. would try reason GF, change mind would get test wear mask results come in. Although think would ever suggest something like me.  least 5x pfizer sure microbes [excessive hand washing cause lost 35 lbs 3 months, little different lack taste. like food put body absorbed digested. Scariest shit ever happen life, starving death doctor says ""I seem fine"" one exciting needed taken twice day instead eight times day.

Sadly, trailed Merck's drug efficacy every step way. death rates vaccinated cohort typically higher age. I'm attempting make comparison unvaccinated.

It's something like: 

* elderly vulnerable COVID, 
* large % elderly get vaccinated, 
* breakthroughs occur population that's already vulnerable, 
* case fatality ratio high group.

If see claim high percentages vaccinated dying precisely why. also counter-balanced large percentage young unvaccinated people getting COVID recovering fine. weighted ends.  Also precedent. 

*Jacobson v. Massachusetts* 1905. Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), United States Supreme Court case Court upheld authority states enforce compulsory vaccination laws. Court's decision articulated view individual liberty absolute subject police power state. Yeah, anything 'casual romance' prevalent ever COVID. Je suis le pr√©sident de Burundi.  Fair point. Long-COVID whole different thing that's outside research I've doing. certainly risk way knowing quantify it. something like string 4 5 probabilities, risk getting lower multiplication.

\[Probability Exposure\] X \[Probability Infection\] X \[Probability passing beyond innate immunity\] X \[Probability moderate severe illness\] X \[Probability lasting effects\]   simple. I've sometimes cut much wash hands reduce often use protect hands (they get point bleed drying out). things like try put lotion time wash hands, even multiple times simply cannot make damage soap sensitive skin. speaking putting hands near mouth, quite often process trying undo dryness lips. Definitely consider adding hand-washing.  choose good rate, absolutely. True, likely need 90% total population fully vaccinated reach level herd immunity current varient, reporting number like 85% relevant number 60% dangerously misleading. weeded top 3% medical care workers likely kill malpractice lack medical knowledge. Well that‚Äôs great, considering age range already unlikely end hospital begin statistically.  mentality. really hard people treat COVID spike like flu wave, even vaccines 

Plus precedent rules place, see sticking around quite would want reproduce anti-vax degenerates anyways? Let self-select get Covid doses? immune now? Yet people think vaccines social distancing work. Honest god, wish people would use brains done pandemic. Europe part, can't we? Doubt consider. accepted protect staff‚Äù - coffee shops city  accepting cash, 

&amp;#x200B;

That one seems pretty reasonable... preventing non-covid diseases. true. become infective, really deadly surprising. state governors(Florida) banning mask mandates suing businesses force people get vaccinated.  police force attended large concert, pit, face face belly belly back back. girlfriend asked wear mask house home. long this... suggest protocol ? I'm vaccinated booster last thursday Higher population means less susceptible random noise given rate infections. population DC, example, day-to-day fluctuations affect 7-day average, leading bumpy graph, could get brief dips artificially (which they've days 7-day average spiked like 50% day). OTOH, Wisconsin higher case numbers nearly bumpy DC despite slightly smaller population.  still able impose mandates various sorts without state emergency?  even normalisation, expect largest state outlier simply bigger sample, diversity likely contain, likely cancels extremes averaged. Throughout pandemic, states great mostly small states. big small states top worst list, contagion makes easy things get really had. well takes coordination compliance hard, especially big scale. impressive bring /100k numbers population 39,000,000 place 10% 3% many people. 

Another way looking it, average together enough next best states' numbers get similar population, whole group's average good best state's within group. Scientists saying Covid become endemic. pandemic ends number people dying becomes manageable. disease get vaccinated periodically still catch time time. suck rarely deadly previous vaccinations/infections. somebody say ‚Äúhey work last week‚Äù you‚Äôll say ‚ÄúI caught Covid unfortunately 5 days.‚Äù big deal people.  36 weeks pregnant, due booster 15 days. horror stories covid pregnancies would frighten parent-to-be core. I'm suuuuper cautious I'm able booster, usual. Hopefully green light get mixed dose then, too.  biological perspective, vaxxed men women signal  
health. vital trait bearing rearing young. naturally seek  
healthy partners send DNA tomorrow. get vaxxed. It‚Äôs  
ticket romance, ultimately, genetic survival.‚Äù

Who talks like that? really ""vaccination""/""survived previous illness"" signal? disagree. Unvaccinated unsexy. However, Ravi Gupta, professor clinical microbiology University Cambridge, told Guardian mutations particular concern. ‚ÄúA222V seen lineages Delta,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt really large effect virus.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, nothing worry fear-mongoring media. sure. feel impacted, especially people Melbourne. point videos circulated US painting entire country living dystopian dictatorship police bash citizens ‚Äúpeaceful protesters‚Äù arrest wearing masks etc. anyone else noticed lot posts labeled talking points anti-vaxxers using make mandate seem worse. better way title would ""Only 3% Washington State's hospital employees refuse vaccine."" Update: went got booster. :)  Remindme! 37 months PANDEMIC end. call annual flu season pandemic? No. becomes ENDEMIC. time deadliness manageable we‚Äôll exposed enough vaccination natural infection. senators trying ‚Äúbar businesses requiring employees get coronavirus vaccinations‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm RN keep up-to-date vaccines, I‚Äôve mandatory flu shots every year 20 years mandatory TB skin test every 6 months - keep patients safe. 

That part duty anyone cares others, deal at-risk vulnerable people, keep safe you. People never risk health seeking healthcare. 

Therefore, businesses like hospitals healthcare organizations (doctors offices, outpatient surgery centers, laboratories diagnostic testing, etc) NEVER barred mandating vaccines. essentially barring protecting patients. booster shots for. Also,, let's use morons terminology calling jab. short surges frequent, one long surge prevents surges

I honestly understand point trying make here. think even possible states higher vaccine rates like California going deaths per capita Florida? 

There statistical humanitarian way think ""doing nothing"" could still possibly best course action here. Yup, wish people wouldn‚Äôt post misinformation like that. Covid coronavirus flu not. said Covid mutate nearly much flu. data seems showing, vulnerable populations (elderly, folks severe underlying conditions, etc.) remain vulnerable even vaccination.

Even booster well? like, technically remain *more* vulnerable non vulnerable significantly? Lying vaccine highly contagious deadly virus requires real consequences extreme. People normalized willing murderers. seem disputing it. responded multiple people pointed California rate 60% fully vaccinated (which % total population rather eligible pop), ""this website says 72.1% fully vaccinated."" correcting people number measuring different thing. Honestly plan wearing masks winter anyway. face gets cold mask comfortable! doesn‚Äôt Florida deliberately underreport numbers? idiotic reporting method?  1) everyone wants data. happening real time unfortunately 

2) people making predictions won‚Äôt big deal studied variants see correlation - aka similarities - mutation transmissible dangerous there. vaccination vigilance PR unreal, community mostly behind movement mask recommendations? 3M Auras really comfortable me. also powecom KN95's seal feel secure. Higher population + less rural = higher infection rate. everyone responded exact way, cases per 100,000 would higher California South Dakota people simply around more. don‚Äôt think ‚Äúhighest population state‚Äù meaningless here, get sentiment. Unrelated anyone know michigan seems spike late? Didn‚Äôt spike late alpha variant well?    It‚Äôs Russia‚Äôs vaccination rate low, 32.8% fully vaccinated compared nearly 70% us U.K. - even could much better.

I thank God vaccines would metaphorical slightly literal bloodbath. humble opinion, it‚Äôs bit irresponsible CNN give people publicity. ""About 3%"" fired/quit

""More 92%"" state workers **still employed** vaccinated

""Roughly 3%"" received accommodation

""4.6%"" state flux

&amp;#x200B;

92 + 3 + 4.6 = 99.6 think sucks lose bonus stupid get shot. realize make written communication sarcastic enough since put syndical tone. Put insult rude. really watching saying sneaking away pub I‚Äôm people getting vaccine. means that‚Äôs want go it. trying create mandate people get fear losing jobs wrong matter way try look it. 
Plus already vaccine worried people getting it. good body protected right? mind sharing source? seems pretty extreme blame kids.. researched yet, adhoc suggest Still got much lower death rates US instance, significant proportion population believes vaccines Bill Gates tracking devices. I'd call morons. 89% age 12 vaccinated, that‚Äôs why. seems trend short surges frequent, one long surge prevents surges.

My question is, cost worth sense. mean people lot hesitancy vaccines reason, ranging realizing effective inspite data have, full conspiracy theories, coupled fact natural immunity seems good, say need it. personally would opt vaccine cases, others won't, even possibility added immunity vaccine convince them. rules relaxed lot made science focused Coronavirus subreddit, became news cool talk mild politics Go Cubs! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô pick bootstraps. combo ""questionable data"" herd immunity schools guess. 12s fueling spike point, I'm guessing either they're schools requiring masks already got it. Plus, Florida reporting data accurately consistently. mean, trend continues cats could become vector virus travel. lot bigger sounds Isn‚Äôt also MERK treatment undergoing testing?    case Las Vegas Nevada reporting ran strains male got twice less 60 days - sequenced different versions delta.  find article suck mobile. even hospitalization... like take overly concerned mother bringing kid hospital panic take that?

Because say child vaccinated covid, mothers going less concerned.  
Also current worker shortage take much stay overnight bet there. Luckily nearly enough recall guy. Turns ""staying alive"" pretty positive thing californians vaccines attend public schools absolutely go body. 

But, technically, didn‚Äôt say anything something going body, really cool told do?

And accept told time. traffic laws, leash laws, noise ordinances, to, yes, mandatory vaccines attend public schools. It‚Äôs part living society. Feel free reject society live hermit. Liberty Counsel

Wow! That's enough vaccinate 77% world. sounds like /r/homeopathy crap. absolutely right, I'm guilty too.

We demanding *more* like this, fewer. significant 40,000-50,000 people getting sick awful, time panic stations situation. vaccinated, virus particularly dangerous vast majority people. Everyone continue taking basic precautions isolate get infected.

And variants, know UK tracking sub variant Delta - however reason think variant dangerous Delta.

And regarding long covid, research place that, there's absolutely consistency findings. completely messed fact everyone come anything long term sort vicinity testing positive covid blaming covid whatever they've come long term. We're going need wait long time get clear information long covid, meantime important hyperbolic danger it. took plunge. Several friends got 2 doses moderna 4 months getting full dose sinovac.  cent‚Äô written two words Australia. ‚ÄòPercent‚Äô Australian  Delta &amp; mutations made along way She‚Äôs mid 20s pretty physically fit.

Dang I‚Äôve spent least $250 far.  helpful certain circumstances life. misjudged size basket. don‚Äôt understand people ok 40,000 -50,000 people day getting sick. come this?

How many people get sick cold flu waves? reading local news moment around three times many people flu covid without widespread flu testing. 

I share concerns however. high rate viral circulation UK despite high vaccination worrisome paint good outlook countries winter. death rate lower certainly negligible. 

We woods yet. Piss ocean unfortunately.  Well vaccinated flu regularly rotate strains getting shot strain multiple times life think supports provide long lasting immunity. [He say it... trust numbers coming Florida. Leadership shady shit. that's good. (assuming testing reasonable)

my area (of US) 400 per 100k (almost 10x amount) active cases. Like ACLU 1565 active cases yesterday, that's 500 per million, positivity rate 1.86% (Uruguay). lot vaccines three shot series. get hearted yet. unusual need third shot. &amp; partner 3rd shot easier 2nd. probably need yearly that's unreasonable. 1028 daily deaths. 34k new cases.  Kremlin far eschewed imposing nationwide lockdown help stop spread virus. 
  
Instead, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin backed cabinet‚Äôs proposal declare non-working week starting Oct. 30, hardest-hit regions starting week earlier, Oct. 23. strict measures effectively paid vacation orders non-essential businesses furlough workers. someone post question everyday?

the specific chrome extension used banned automod find one lets mark people's usernames reminders, ""disingenuous question"" could tag someone even delete posts still see disingenuous past review post I‚Äôm genuinely curious people screaming ‚Äútyranny!‚Äù polio vaccine. sure weren‚Äôt schools required every vaccine kids get, Covid showed suddenly public health political football. qouted modifying sequence. modifying chemistry - bond nucleotides. no, pfizer Moderna modify exact way - chemistry (this academically discovered) locations sequence same. would hope fewer deaths difference vaccination last January!

The huge number cases problem though even unnecessary. 

Why people accept high increasing number ill contagious people? know high levels infection harmful vulnerable people, even vaccinated (see Colin Powell.) know infection means chances variants UK already tracking sub-variant delta. know people get long Covid disabling medical conditions.

I don‚Äôt understand people ok 40,000 -50,000 people day getting sick. come this? lot things seem understandable predicated ""if care others""  medical questions, see doctor. although friend went doctor turned doctor severely anti-vaccine found balanced doctor ask questions to.

that said, check actual FDA reviewed studies actual legitimate studies since find personal % myocarditis vaccine check % myocarditis covid find better get vaccine avoid covid.

i opposed vaccine first came since none study details published trump suggesting dates prior election (similarly biden saying wanted approvals certain date fall). waited studies came out, checked effectiveness percentages, got vaccine first day eligible  Given enough time everyone come contact virus, comes covids endemic properties. repeat: everyone. Obviously far better getting 2nd shot. covid infection also cause myocarditis, often way severe vaccination. Therefore logic decision get vaccinated. issue of: ""i wont vaccinate dont tiny risk mild myocarditis"", no, issue missing 2nd shot increase risk severe myocarditis severe illnesses covid infection. record im also young, male heart issues. encouraged mums boss get shot also heart condition, bypass etc. told get docotors opinion, confirmed encouragement vaccination got shot. People hearth conditions even encouraged get vaccine higher risk severe covid Still Get Child Yes. CDC continues recommend everyone aged 12 years older get vaccinated COVID-19. known risks COVID-19 illness related, possibly severe complications, long-term health problems, hospitalization, even death, far outweigh potential risks rare adverse reaction vaccination, including possible risk myocarditis child already gotten first dose Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccine, it‚Äôs important get second dose unless vaccination provider doctor tells get concerns COVID-19 vaccination, talk child‚Äôs doctor, nurse, clinic.  Hat Trick! Percent. one word. easily thousand customers single day. roughly 20 employees work day. 

The 20 employees show proof put file keep asking. get push back employees ask.

It's lot different. Speaking Israel, third big drop impact booster program? tracking much tracking Ireland, Portugal countries high vaccination rates.   infected, three tests one day. Two negative. Tests ain't shit. could see bit Maria damage everywhere, think they‚Äôve done great job restoring everything. absolutely lovely country. loved much visiting March! Correct. sure people downvoting factual statement. working 2 jobs stay afloat tired socialize after, doubt would able find someone without pandemic too. Ha ha. Yeah, right, 'what know nothing '  super confusing.  Downvote Toddlers?

Could please stop moving goalposts? Either way still saving lives   We're near 70% 18+ fully vaccinated. looking at? vaccination rate low 30s. restrictions till now. Well it‚Äôs Charles Darwin vs propagandists followers. money Darwin.  Unfortunately, vaccinated people hospitalized. Hospitals bad shape yet, October.  close lots testing facilities Florida? I've seen people online saying go ER test, exactly incentive.  long us 65's wait get Pfizer booster? six months since second shot. Extremely low vaccine uptake. People simply don‚Äôt want vaccine unfortunately. We've living threat long flu / long cold / long whatever entire lives. real reason stay home miss life. lot asymptomatic people getting tested there?

Yes, UK testing like maniacs.

Many people get tested weekly work school.  hopefully week! got J&amp;J, I'll probably wait bit longer you. low donation numbers mainly due disappointing production output J&amp;J AstraZeneca vaccine. Currently Pfizer Moderna still used either initial vaccination boosters, actually still much donate. However, Germany alone donated 20 million example, clearly moving forward. People got J&amp;J really got screwed. Lower initial effectiveness J&amp;J booster gives 4X protection improvement. Compared Moderna booster gives 76X.

In hindsight, J&amp;J never approved. ""one shot solution"" bogus. whole lot people would better today gone Pfizer Moderna. God knows enough supply. Fortunately J&amp;J never reach large market share, damage limited. next year different set flu strains. may happen Delta, certainly yet. also kind scary people understand uncontrolled deadly respiratory virus public health problem individual freedom problem. Reads study efficacy infection. 

Claims vaccine meant effective infection. 

I guess people dumbasses.  Thought transmissible Delta, think thing already halfway around world now, paying attention. Severe disease overwhelmingly dominated unvaccinated every jurisdiction earth. Sorry, lost 2 years life, gonna lose another one satisfy pathetic superiority complex.  referring something like this:
Joe Bob goes looks current case levels sees 15% peak level, restrictions still place starts complaining ""What Hell? We're nowhere near overhwelming hospitals, libt4rd government making us wear masks?""
At point would hope number Joe Bobs low enough we've seen 3 different times quick things ramp basically non-existant really bad.
Now, we're quickly closing point enough immunity exponential growth relatively slow caps potential hosts get critical level. Places like Florida Texas might already there. We'll probably know February case Nov/Dec created biggest peak first year this.  general rule, people say ""I'm going sleep anyone X"", really saying preferentially sleeping people X. public espousals rules like way winnow options real. Question:

CDC says less 700 citizens age 18 died covid. vaccine mandatory taken vaccine support it.  mandatory kids things reduce chances mutations?   Sounds like Russia needs real leader. people still masking additional safety there? might differentiating factor. possibly. looked charting israel immediately post vaccine approval? see declines age group age group approved there. really cool see Sputnik vaccine appears similar efficacy vaccines, sure. Problem seems production - managed produce 45 million promised billion doses export. 

Russians clearly don‚Äôt want Sputnik vaccine, perhaps choice vaccines would convince certain Sputnik-skeptic Russians vaccinate?  I'll hand this, definitely given lot thought.

There's zero percent chance happening, mostly extreme take even pro-vax folks would revolt point. talking massive, nationwide civil unrest forces entrusted keeping domestic peace would probably standing solidarity protestors.

A move extreme would quite literally undermine power government probably end overthrown. Vaccinate people get level protection prevents mild illness. seem like two doses current vaccines enough that. Maybe 3 will. low early summer low period covid ""most places"" mentioned. want compare lows lows highs highs accurately know things getting better worse. 

most recent data i've seen still showing delta 99% presumably seeing waning immunity (as see nyt chart back showing 70+ age increasing) fixed boosters going (last checked 10% senior population third).

things much worse year ago. keep saying that, still true. currently 15% worse (and falling) places maintaining kind precautions last year time. yes different states peak different times yes combined immunity vaccines plus confirmed cases different different places, overall no, worse.

and yes, US strain monitoring. data published weekly typically someone (or dozen someones) post link goes out. company still WFH.

Business good pandemic, new hires acquisitions, enough office space everyone now. Yep, going give testing requirement people sort exemption vaccine daily testing. right yes that's everyone Covid. hospitals overrun can't blame heart disease, hospitals issues work out. Mask mandates definitely accepted world.  anything different Russia's numbers high past several weeks (usually second number deaths per day United States)? Anything special driving Russian surge? mostly related sort bad behavior seeing elsewhere (i.e. low vaccination rates, refusal engage proper masking/distancing/social behaviors mitigate transmission, etc.)? Don‚Äôt get wrong, mean Sputnik produced enough vaccines meet worldwide demand. vaccine uptake Russia like Western Europe, chance would shortage. Based n out. I‚Äôm waiting third moderna booster clear, I‚Äôm going get it! Lol what? live, among vaccinated people hospitalized, lowest % got Sputnik-V vaccine.

I got well, actually one wanted get even though country Pfizer, AZ Sinopharm lot contacts people tested positive covid hours day later, yet single symptom disease.

Sputnik-V works perfectly. Let's hope. shocking bad deaths were/are current wave 50%-65% adults vaccinated increased access monoclonal antibody treatments. second look think breakdown average per age group. strange thing report‚Ä¶ average overall reflected line chart. rough math seems like that‚Äôs they‚Äôre doing. 

Maybe it‚Äôs attempt reflect 70s disproportionately effecting hospitalizations? Shocker. Depends restrictions. Mask mandates accepted initial resistance, occupancy restrictions probably, shelter place/lockdowns probably Surviving covid, gone far, generally means long term disability.

We got Delta cause (everyone assumed) I‚Äôm even talking mandates lol.

You‚Äôre really mad simple easy thing, I‚Äôm even arguing mandatory forever.

Yes, last year winter spike quite predictable reason cite. don‚Äôt think implies all. implies learn live COVID. 100% true. I‚Äôll save click: little known it. [There steep declines flu cases end flu Obviously indication every year flu dying off. Cycles infection produces boom/bust waves. time genetic evolution waning immunity produces susceptible population environmental factors (ie indoor gatherings) increase opportunities spread. saying Delta factor, reason expect COVID outbreaks become rare way measles is. ""daring"" people build mountain bullshit. No, I‚Äôm saying all. I‚Äôm hoping get lows seen early summer stay there. I‚Äôm worried vaccine isn‚Äôt effective enough whatever strain we‚Äôre seeing here, I‚Äôm wondering shit trend continue exacerbated holidays not. I‚Äôm triple vaccinated, wondering WTF going on, things much worse year ago even places super high vaccination rates. I‚Äôd like know US actually genetic strain monitoring not. UK also tests double rate US.

They all-time positive test percentage 2.6%, far lower now.  live UK low case area. frightening hear news see data. Vaccine roll teens gone great, I'm still waiting teen vaccinated sign when. 

I'm fully vaccinated, still relatively young healthy, worried much me, I'm really worried child. I'm sure hit child's school soon, happens then?

My husband Netherlands, said one masked anywhere. worried heart issues options either living inside bubble ensure get Covid19 get vaccine, Covid19 infection without immunity sure worse heart vaccine even worst case. Doesn‚Äôt someone post question everyday?

None new. fact, it‚Äôs crazy similar reactions past generations. seem forget lot people got quite sick vaccination, even able work. can't compare yearly flu shot. Germany testing around 900,000 people per week..

Two different numbers. Germany unfortunately reports PCR tests . UK number PCR tests + rapid tests. know fact tests work get reported anywhere. someone tests positive rapid tests required take PCR test. result get reported. Doctors course order PCR tests right away. I'm fully vaccinated, since april.. I'm also like, exactly ladies man.

It's never easier hook last months. Lots people pent making lost time. I've convince 1 girl needed use condom last several months. Uk government = dithering, blithering ,smug, entitled knownothing arseholes ü§î 95+% hospitalization cases unvaccinated.

That's one take.

Germany testing around 900,000 people **per week**..


The figures really even close, /u/sentimental_dragon correct said. Marocco reportedly suspending flights Marocco UK, Germany Netherlands delta variant concerns.

Source (french): Could someone explain general happy mood thread? 
I see UK yesterday 223 deaths reported. people lack empathy leve? care perception well vaccine working delta people actually dying?
Also fact get infected SARS-CoV-2 severe case COVID-19 mean all. kind hope long term effects, know. yeah, number cases important paramater normal human beings. avoid paywall iOS using reader view. Would mind elaborating architecture/code improvements flu epidemic? aware history major changes following it, least flu itself. interesting  UK's case number, hospitalization, death, really never changed much since July peak. remain high.

They stopped talking pretend nothing happening. complete lack preventive measure shocking. :D 

Oh COVID reason stopping getting laid. meant mutations worrying, mutation. Mutation happens time. Question survive thrive. mainly children driving infections UK moment. Hospitalisations predominantly COVID-deniers anti-vaxxers, although increasing number double-vaccinated people admitted.

I'm slightest bit bothered someone who's refused vaccine dying miserable death, worried impact unrelated healthcare. 

We late vaccinating under-18s restrictions removed abruptly completely thanks moronic Prime Minister desperate people like him. Secret gay agenda? symptoms gained force ‚Äì drinks lemonade, tastes like gasoline, sometimes smells smoke isn‚Äôt there.

My brother law got pretty nasty case C19 4 months ago. course didn‚Äôt get vaxxed even though urged to. political stance think just‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt take thing seriously. 

But day says he‚Äôll smell smoke taste gasoline. anyone ELI 5? brain/nervous system thing? know diseases besides COVID diseases readily spread fomites like hands? Someone follow example. Even depends area question, lots nasty parasites found dirt (i.e. feces thats found dirt) really number us. get sentiment though, need exposed things order build immune systems. long?

Exactly thats question, reports I've seen vary, say last while, six months much, could depend severity case well. seems inconsistent, lot data, least found much yet. convince people get least one dose vaccine, previous infection, two? ~50,000 cases day ~100 hospitalisations. spreading disease weren‚Äôt sex before.

Well definitely were, seeing STI's increasing long time now.  Impossible say without getting tested. theory, probably pretty good immune response however individual variation people generate long-lasting immune responses infected. Sexually distant new distancing.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Maybe, still feels like gamble. friend (healthy, early 40's) got COVID December, fully vaccinated spring got reinfected August. spend month ICU. know thats one case incredibly rare kind failure seen vaccinated point want friend, want statistical outlier. Thats recommend people continue avoid getting COVID, vaccinated - really shitty disease. Hopefully people realized long delta around far contagious mu truth mu never going huge concern would competed delta everywhere two reasons

1. Infection guarantee immune system mounted strong enough response long-lasting immunity.
2. immune systems response COVID fades time.

(Note true vaccinate people, vaccinated mean immune system learned enough vaccine vaccination guarantee life-long immunity).

Boosters required COVID. lot safer get vaccine booster rather get reinfected. time goes effectiveness dwindles, I‚Äôm assuming everyone continue need boosters time goes on. could become yearly like flu healthier bunch lines flu vaccine. things play like flu it‚Äôll become weaker many people probably won‚Äôt need vaccine strongly need now. mean let‚Äôs honest look numbers weren‚Äôt great terms amount people taking flu vaccine. year I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs looking much better people fear due pandemic. ones left ones don‚Äôt care does. Usually ones care would force ‚Äúthose don‚Äôt‚Äù take precautions anyway. neither partner cares precautions get STI heaven.  get vaccine immediately still lots antibodies

Have objectively tested assuming? got infected mean immune system mounted strong enough response produce long-lasting immunity. Yes many countries like on, going see mutations pop every week? also thank scientists doctors vaccines too. Natural immunity effective % infected long? Thats really important information know.  Makes perfect sense. People spreading disease weren‚Äôt sex before. people taking care picture fuckheads higher chance getting laid. Regardless whether new mutation worth worrying about, media try cause fear. Mu put variants investigation, country's media top headline 3-4 days, international media referred article somewhere. never came back explain people Mu really something worry obviously clicks letting people know scientific truth. I'd imagine train body's immune system fight virus better. like COVID going away time soon booster available would take it. friend (healthy, young 40s) like ended ICU month shit happens. 

My takeaway: avoid getting COVID, vaccinated really shitty disease get. Even conservative owner local liquor store shits democrats voted no. said thinks newsom handled covid terribly horrible governor, hell lot better anyone else would have. fact natural immunity seems good,

Good long?

Because COVID immunity last forever risk life every time get reinfected immune system properly trained. need get used fact needing boosters long time risk getting infected enough immunity survive infection. Welp, looks like time acquire chaturbate addiction understand England vaccines Astra Zenica. Could reason picking bit Delta? Well couple issues natural immunity

1. might take. get sick develop strong lasting immune response putting risk reinfection, vaccine booster prevent that
2. still really know long immunity lasts (for either natural vaccinated populations). However clear wane boosters needed. question becomes:

Would rather natural immunity wane time put risk infected poor outcome would rathe take booster keep immunity going? knew someone caught twice within 3 months. Caught May 2020 July 2020. Said May knocked month, July 2 weeks. said weren‚Äôt gonna get vaccinated (this pre vaccines pre Delta) cause already caught twice like uhh, probably catch 3rd time more. Yup, honor system work people honor. Well, part issue vaccines required, unvaccinated lie (explicitly not) take masks wherever vaccinated would. require everyone wear masks make sure everyone is.

San Francisco seeing dropping COVID numbers high vaccination, recently changed things areas vaccinations required require masking. shift happening, requires actual vaccination requirements first. honor system vaccinated need masks unvaccinated still wearing requires honor among unvaccinated. imagine produce long lasting immune response. Enough clear virus, enough remember second time around. body facing second infection compromised state - damaged lungs, worn energy reserves...Its like facing Round 2 100%. Name county authorities fuck need take shot purely function virus still prevalent likelihood running affected people 8s encountering measles whatnot. anything particularly magic virus bad vaccine, ran numbers chance running infected person times virulence came side booster.

We eeking every shred immunity that's good thing. fyi clarify would 95% global population, country's pop. That's assume vaccines working moment highest vaxd countries got worst covid. Australians don‚Äôt really choice  50.000 people vaccinated risk pose health system quite low. virus high reproductive number, tracing cold cases. 
So 50.000 sound high many going end hospital dying. 
And don‚Äôt want vaccinate, really care? society keep wearing masks living restriction assholes ? 
The discussion restrictions masks medieval non pharmacological interventions, vaccinate people. Unvaccinated kids level risk vaccinated adults don‚Äôt see makes big difference. ??

For vast majority people, getting vaccinated totally optional. getting information from?   Theres far many deaths compared Europe. isnt acceptable. country utterly selfish Americanised Im afraid.   perfect course better lot governors.

Texan here. I'm envious AF yall's governor It‚Äôs certainly important. shouldn‚Äôt vaccinated kids able drop masks? Hire Redditor immediately. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs totalitarian say ‚Äúokay don‚Äôt want vaccine stay home‚Äù, that‚Äôs outcome choice. like drunk driving, intoxicated drive home hit person, go jail. It‚Äôs happens. It‚Äôs still choice drive sober drunk, one accepted outcome. it‚Äôs choice get jab not, come accepted outcome  Take good look COVID stats Uruguay, Chile, Portugal, San Marino UAE tell vaccination matter problem screw statistics may make look vaccines effective enough.



Bulgarian so... problems. hope green certificates, going introduced tomorrow, help increase vaccination rate here. doubt good idea sit idly wait answer. debate silenced? know. trying say need adjust risk calculator. risk it‚Äôs going different everyone every family. make sense restrict activities vaccinated unlikely ending hospital ? 
Also, keep asking masks probably useless material fitting‚Ä¶.  paraphrasing another thread: call convenience store clerks ""the tobacco police"" bartenders ""the booze police"", still expect check IDs kind thing. currently Coronavirus killing way people tobacco booze im going vaccinate fuck kid  Yeah moved sunshine coast June, BAU here, apart 10-day snap lockdown couple months back. People generally good wearing masks though.  Gee, imagine, world full easily transmittable diseases, sexual assault trafficking, many people over-sharing personal matters via social media, people less likely go home rando bar. Truly astonishing.  Yep. Agreed, care get sick. choice make. disagree people want vaccine, would never force get it. right Boris: mIsSiOn aCcOmPlIsHeD

Covid: hold delta  wanted natural immunity two classes taught BioNTech vaccine. much better teacher organic ""vaccine"". classes lot fun. Walgreens make check box sheet paper says qualify. That's it. like verify it. want give shot. 

Make sure check right box, iirc, lower second one, first one 65. Depends are. Canberra, lot government workers live, 99% vaccinated. country areas 50%.

Sydney, might expect full smart, sciency people actually large cohort tin foil hat wearing anti-establishment wannabe 'free citizens' think vaccine plot kill everyone. older sickly, get it. 80 year old 550x likely die young person. I‚Äôve never agreed west coast people regarding anyway. I‚Äôve always thought Five Guys much better anyway I've seen one stock (out two times I've gone), recent wave.  can‚Äôt still get infected though. I'm worried think alternative go back work restrictions, masks spreading evolving virus. reason feel alternative everyone working survive indoctrinated successive Tory Governments. resources survive pandemic responsibly reducing income all. Unfortunately consistently asked open early, shut late accepting deaths people want Christmas holidays. Arseholes!! Nice paywall. they're refusing follow laws relates employees, that's one thing. mask vaccine police public. People stabbed that. 

As actual police, we've decided want policing that's out. absolutely choice take it, happens bc choice also accept. can‚Äôt cake eat too, doesn‚Äôt work way plan vaccine rollout includes 28M eligible kids? That‚Äôs wonderful! However, Really hope they‚Äôre prepared either follow younger kids similar dosage ship abroad highly doubt many get kids vaccine. 

I plan getting 5 year old shot soon pediatrician schedule us in. school used line us lunch room give us flu vaccine swine flu vaccine came out. course vaccine much controversial unfortunately parents going allow kids get hopefully get supplies schools setup like that. infectious enough escape lab, infectious enough get directly bats humans.

Good know....  Can't deny pfizer vaccine one best available, behaviour suspicious unfortunately probably used antivaxxers fuel agenda didnt shit pants deliberately cut corners Imagine this: company Moscow decides time go back office, late August, everyone working home 1.5 years.

Now happens, *unvaccinated* get go back working home, (got vaccine back July) commute crowded subway, progressively getting colder rainier outside. 

So, basically punished (relatively) right thing is. follow christs teaching. Christ taught us socialism Republicans anti socialism anti christ   work, get unemployment checks. 

Physically work front line jobs, get Corona, pay taxes. 


Volunteer shot, go back work. direct contact someone Corona, get paid leave. 


Don't get shot, 'contact' someone Corona, get 10 days paid leave.l let keep working home. forced law get shot, here's $500.

On purely Covid basis reckon we'll probably point end year. ONS weekly surveys they're reporting ~8% children England active infections similar peak infections Scotland age group went back school. surprised infections start dropping significantly age group next week two, especially half term coming up.

Flu probably rough beginning next year though. logic dictate case 12-18 year old Covid positive better without vaccine? Let‚Äôs say 100 kids positive .8% goes hospital, 93% vaccine Covid positive don‚Äôt go hospital means 7 kids hospital vaccine Covid case requiring help ?

With current school infection rates (somewhere close 8% active infections school age children nationally) there's good chance Covid actually burns age group.

There respite cases thanks half term next couple weeks. aren‚Äôt endangering people already vaccinated. we're longer mass fatalities every state every day, happen 85-95% population either vaccinated caught it.

Supposedly we're 85% (in US) surely can't much longer. I'd say Alaska step above. Virgin America used best. I'm still bitter merger Alaska. effective vaccines themselves. 

Confirmed cases count vaccinated. reason doesn‚Äôt people think would somehow embolden anti-vaxers.

I wish could give horizon look forward to, nobody can. I'm hoping 2023. I'll accept longer (because we'll accept it).

Life goes meanwhile. Jokes still funny. Hugs still loving. Work still needs get done. Peanut butter still tastes amazing toast. Life still good, even transition. find opposite boat. Lots ghosting, mega late reasons, etc.   social distancing measures longer required law Britain.


WRONG!

Covid restrictions devolved issue, UK/Britain wide Covid laws. still required wear masks Scotland, Wales Northern Ireland. Yes national government decide happens England unlike rest country, separate devolved government/parliament deal things. said rising fast, numbers equal. indeed rising roughly rate. May ask long since last? 6mo exactly, less? Saying ""there unknowns"" false statement vaccines effective infection. people would pretend vaccinated unvaccinated people. Totally agree good job Washington. Bullshit. people care never cared care. People running around exact shit they've always doing. Update?  Putin still cowering private Covid bunker?

Doing nothing arrest crisis?

This like vaccines, meant prevent getting sick all, kill virus altogether. vaccine neither things, meant *lessen symptoms* even reduces chances getting sick spreading virus, stop it, much still get sick vaccinated, even severely so.

Also, generally speaking, natural immunity preferred body builds immunity *appropriate body*. concern particular vaccine, traditional one (that works bodies natural immune response) might less effective *because targeted*. course know sure, still get vaccinated regardless definitely least increase chances lessened response exposure covid. wanna see rate long covid it‚Äôs pretty impossible pin REALLY think give masking enough credit anywhere. area New Jersey, masking still pretty high.

I can't actually find source New England higher UK. see states range 69 - 61% UK whole 67.5%. higher, incredibly close. think particularly surprising single region U.S par UK personally. rate measure afterall. 

The UK decided rolling vaccination program younger age groups earlier European countries decided opposite. also prioritising third booster jabs elerderly. probably much difference UK European countries end.   believe people still going hook even vaccinated know that! Maybe problem live.

Here's hoping! industries super paranoid. know people work movie sets pretty intense, like, dozen vital people get sick burning tens millions day production stalled immediate cost, count downstream cost delayed release. really make sense, unless people hooking people covid increase. kid least we'd get booster shots every five years something, less 6 months. especially mind, mean second shot certainly hit hard bad could been, really unexpected extremely demoralizing. That‚Äôs actually really weird they‚Äôre testing you‚Äôre vaccinated. work requires proof vaccination. almost certainly always going need boosters though. Good news: they‚Äôre offer combined flu shot kill two annual birds one stone.  requires tests even vaccinated? seems like lot, imagine jobs vital extra special careful. healthcare movie industry set? 

Boosters much surprise particular concern, long virus immunity better side risk reward line boosters. help exponential growth every slight reduction transmission huge help. Vaccines matter though. cut risk severe illness death almost zero. state, 22% breakthrough infections (we vaxxed early) 4% hospitalizations 1% deaths among vaccinated people, average age deaths 84. high vax rates Delta, we‚Äôre predicted hit herd immunity December. 

I think big things people waiting masks-wise hospitalizations go kids get vaccinated. Statistically speaking, Covid minor thing now, unvaccinated person gets it, that‚Äôs bad news Delta. winter though, really think we‚Äôll past worst this. Delta out-competed every variant, including ones supposedly evaded vaccines like Mu. would also follow trajectory 1918 flu epidemic: two shitty years decades new architecture health codes actually improve people‚Äôs lives.   We've known natural immunity coronaviruses lasts 18 months average, lines that. course vaccines extend protection, nobody knows long.

That timeline purely based antibodies. look cellular immunity (such T-cells), protection lasts much longer.

Wow. UK demonstrated, moment lift restrictions, cases soar even large majority people vaccinated.

We lifted restrictions mid-July cases generally quite flat next three months, likely recent increase colder weather. 

Having restrictions seems perfectly sustainable summer.  spring, city mass vaccination site arena. indoor, huge. areas sectioned walls. chose felt like best option since drive-up sites. Maybe area something similar? Businesses enforce restrictions make regular headlines fights assaults attempted enforcement. taken hand's policy avoid violent encounters. get shut that.

It's bad time business dealing public. Lol fetishist? It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶really easy wear them. 

I wonder people responded way wearing clothes everywhere became mandatory.  Well, guess difference making sure customers vaccinated, employees. State...city...whatever. Thing non-compliant local health policies refusing every single restaurant area doing. n - *not* ! clarify, arguing vaccines make covid worse vaccines increase covid hospitalizations? hospitalization rates several times months ago.

Hospitalisation rates roughly July. covid, gone far, generally means long term disability.

Can evidence that, sounds like hyperbolic claim.  conclusion reach. 

I think seems like vaccinations prevents serious illness, infection, means Covid 19 endemic soon.

That also likely scenario beginning. scientist.

If random critter internet, that's path Joe Rogan.  God fucking tired virus 2 admitted per day hmm, NYT says current average today 2 per 100k june 1st 1 per day, link cited originally  Everyone I've spoken works public health Russia said vaccine widely available there. notion somehow good people taking utterly asinine. mention straight inhumane. important caveat: Hospitalisations follow trend increased infection. 

So seems like various vaccines worse job preventing infection, still, mostly, prevents serious illness. vaccine. compared YoY right around double amount people admitted hospital OCT 2020. That‚Äôs even worse. 

Things much worse year ago, that‚Äôs point. People chose :/ hospitalization rates several times months ago. every one people extremely ill, would assume. can't imagine admit healthy people mild cases hospital. People hospitalized lung damage more. health people sacrificed. Surviving covid, gone far, generally means long term disability. death rates. affect personally, cares, right? usual, timing really something.  would compare hospitalizations time period covid minimized (though i'm sure anyone figured months less covid) time covid maximized (though i'm sure science yet explain cyclical nature)?

why compare hospitalization today versus 365 days ago see impact? crazy hateful - talking Rachel Levine pure trans hate. Disgusting. going get concrete answer. previous low, June, around 2 admitted per day. right around amount hospital. topic people already thought studying. sun goes down, socializing done outside. sister lived Miami ten years. Outdoor living lot people move south. Danes monitored A.Y.4.2 mutation longer Brits, Pfizer Chill, like it. too. I'm tired angry disgusted. spend nine ten hours time building full kind knuckleheads describe, work. Really makes appreciate coming home dog though. help safe space.  Err... um... ""Mission Accomplished."" something like that, guess. ""In pandemic briefing Tuesday, top health leaders (for Vermont, press conference Montpelier) said roughly 80% receiving hospital care disease past week unvaccinated. intensive care units, percentage period even higher ‚Äî approximately 84% treated vaccinated.""

so appears unvaccinated carrying team speak. vaccinate every vermont adult 24 people hospital, compare previous low? vaccinated everyone would less 30 people adults hospital, compare?  opinion present lock homes hopefully convince get it. future, hopefully have, let things happen. Exactly! everyone stays basement never leaves, percentage closer zero.  previous lowest low (most places late spring 2021) would good goal I‚Äôd think. Meanwhile US stuck 57%. Mind you, US access vaccine longer too. (Face palm) true.

""The shots available, people take them, die. sucks it‚Äôs world live in."" 
This understanding that, shots available, people take protect them, die sounds reasonable... 


This attack, seems mentality, agree with, shift previous ""lock unvaccinated homes."" 


Is ""lock vaccinated homes"" ""let unvaccinated die?"" 


My position second one. Ignore science, like heart disease, face consequences. decision. 


The vaccine associated boosters protect unvaccinated, eventually...herd immunity take place? 


Constructive comments line thought? pre-vaccine low? mean testing prominent low peak? look hospitalizations then.  didn‚Äôt mean Vermont higher everywhere mean baselines across country higher previous pre-vaccine lows, really number targeting.   feel like vaccines available young children (and assuming isn‚Äôt new deadly variant)‚Äúnormal‚Äù accomplished. then, people remain cautious kids vulnerable. It‚Äôs extreme. disagree power you. 'Casual romance', love term. Sounds better ways describing it. sure risking getting really sick casual romance. hope protect STDs too.

Oof. Great, wear masks want, wish pandemic mandatory anymore. There. like masks can't wait mask mandate country lifted ASAP. everyone mask fetishist like you.  I'm dodging it; can't find publish data. found something months ago said 85% hospital unvaccinated, 20% eligible population still unvaccinated. 

I wish published data; relevant. nope. People spend much time indoors Summer South North. inverts time year  Huh, okay. Good luck that. wear masks covid. climate change, might much more. Food water scarce time goes on. Maybe lifetime, depending age.  Good! point think would like annual flu. think mandates would necessary flu shot isn‚Äôt mandatory everyday life usually okay dealing it. Natural immunity individuals gotten covid 27X protection virus vaccinate without prior infection. 

I think majority recommended seasonal injections flu restrictions travel unvaccinated go away, hopefully. i'm assuming since OP considers september 9th old interest ""a couple months ago"". i'm hoping read whatever suggesting recent articles.

i doubt comparing unvaccinated unvaccinated, age HUGE impact. interesting see unvaccinated versus vaccinated versus boosted kind scenarios since know immunity waning elderly faster young many HOSPITALIZED PEOPLE vaccinated? dodging point. folks enjoying superiority complex comes saying ‚ÄúLook!

Whether *can* done Delta unknown, that's consensus among epidemiologists. hope. course pandemic ends Delta immediately become endemic countries continues rip unvaccinated pockets, measles centuries. 

Delta currently endemic Uruguay, Bhutan. think countries super special? Pheromones! I've read similar research fascinating. That's factor dating apps, meet IRL definitely effect.   answer? Regardless people want think right, massive minority (likely majority now) done restrictions go back feel covid endemic. serious? Yes suppose would be. never completely get rid Covid, it‚Äôll always fashion. trying sound pessimistic.

Just like every complaint pro-covid crowd, whole life, never complained. you‚Äôre absolutely weird. want too. reason expect happen pandemics petered out. guarantee one behaves way. probably will! want to! I‚Äôm holding hope. adapt new lifestyle. police publicly said town, masks. call mask disputes. Either way somebody's getting jabbed.  might wrong reasons, unfortunately right. Asking staff enforce rules puts danger. Hell hath fury like anti vaxer asked put mask on. Yep! mom, dad one grandparents already it! good data reinfection. really tracked systematically way overall infections, hospitalizations, deaths are. 

Part difficult sperate reinfections something like virus never actually cleared body reasonable time, issues like people tested reinfections mild asymptomatic. Awesome.  recall succeeded

That's big people voted voted Newsom. ~12,000 PCR confirmed cases per day summer exactly died off. idea there'd zero waves post-widespread vaccination without new variant founded anything. Among epidemiologists consensus COVID endemic. make decisions, accept consequences decisions. ""16 months"" seem odd, contradicts much data natural post vaccine reinfection. number come from? Lol Southwest highest rate delays even pandemic. Joke airline Forcing sense threatened lose livelihood don‚Äôt follow mandates set forth government.

if result similar, OAS seemed problem circulating variants, rather affinity maturation produce memory b cells generate potent antibodies effective variants variant specific booster yet neccesary.. Yea. Pretty sure Fox News watches Newsmax goes, ""holy shit, people crazy"" Vaccine mandates [supported historically controversial legal question. Even assume they're rats liars still assume they're smart rats liars. know politicizing Court unpopular vaccine mandate popular, decide issue.  really cool told do?

Or wear least established minimum clothes public? 

Or enrolled school (or homeschooled) you‚Äôre 18? get whole bunch vaccines attend mandatory schools? 

You‚Äôre right! Nobody tells us do! /s far kids go, I'm concerned long-term unknown. know covid affects organs, heart, brain, clotting. Long-covid another issue. 

Kids may risk death, certainly consequences covid, may yet know them. I'd like minimize risk wherever possible. read article?  Nebraska senators tried force businesses businesses banning business mandate.  

Apparently, cool agreeing senators. mitigation efforts?

This may true *some* private schools, ubiquitous. Though, generally non-credentialled teachers 5eaching core curriculum, either, I've observed (and kids went private/charter school, well) nurse told daughter's autism fault consented normal, routine vaccinations. Oh ok say see child autism knew vaccine caused it.

This pandemic. 

Anti-vaxxers place health care. Period. China also totalitarian middle income country resources. 

Even wannabe dictator charge Brazil fraction resources China has. India even populist wannabe disorganized best times. 

Put another way: would rather China‚Äôs system over? It‚Äôs complicated. course. Right US allows international travel. fucking COURSE. UK think would happen unchecked spread? anyone allowing flights UK?

The UK going erase worlds progress. Yeah, every person infected opportunity increase tenfold larger population worse would get. irks rest planet bumble fucking around china huge population, (denied anything wrong locked down), rolled vaccination.  Two GOP senators Gavin Newsom done good job Covid response.  best job apparently.  Yeah got mine yesterday. know bad reaction. thought body familiar Covid already. Wish people would see governments performing states compare Newsom. Also dozens governors trifecta state government excuse terrible management.   mean? second hit India LATAM way.  What's alternative position could in? Yes, please get flu shots. protecting yourself, also helping protect immunocompromised immunosuppressed reducing spread. get flu shots too, flu shots effective, especially reduced immune response.  6 *times* amount people hospital summer. Clearly higher rates correlate sick people. screw sick people, right? Understandable thank sharing. First, peace mind, children least vulnerable population comes SARS-CoV-2. Every country, state, county data point shows this. knowing situation, perhaps children underlying medical conditions fear warranted, otherwise please peace. affecting kids. something like 600 fatalities 20 without underlying conditions whole U.S. Tragic sure, something afraid of.

Breakthrough infections occur. Something understand claim vaccines therapeutic effects (meaning minimize severe infection possibly even prevent infection leading mild cases) seems bearing data. UK data shows case. Even noted vaccine efficacy skeptics admit they're honest (see Dr. RollerGator).

From data seems showing, vulnerable populations (elderly, folks severe underlying conditions, etc.) remain vulnerable even vaccination.  Nobody disputing that. Obviously people eligible vaccinated.  guess, would St. John Paul II, polish conservative popular recent, historically speaking Adios! I'm sure Idaho you. bullshit? 500k Covid 19 deaths never happen. Authorities fuck 2019/2020 rest existence go shots friggin again. 

It need like this.  Revoke licenses. Practice medicine practice horseshit. Choose. pregnant friend youngest sister (34) got covid-19 August. Lost baby, died 14 days later. vaccinated. Hospitalization death much better benchmark. Add data vaccine boosters may unfortunately approaching herd immediately due community spread. 

I think Christmas holidays cold temperatures may create one big Covid wave likely hurt unvaccinated communities point say fuck em. happened happen again. 7 day average. bet lower weekend data. Mask indoors public, otherwise everything same. Got flu shot already. Covid booster probably November. Life good. used run business name Freedom (centered around free software). confirm‚ÄîI longer feel completely comfortable name. Cool.

Now when? Lol wtf wrong you. Newsom occupies arguably second consequential office nation. huge population, economic power, nonobstrucionist party backing throughout state, individual leader outside presidency.

I've lived 40 years I'm really glad let fringe temper tantrum usurp office. Remember Florida data ... issues.

For one, counting visitors got shot Deaths fewer since vaccine time least. There's going crazy worldwide shortage vaccinated workers unvaxxed  Johnson's hubris ridden 'Mission Accomplished' moment, first enjoyed Dubya Bush declared war Middle East.  basically want dictatorship.   That'd also interesting possibility agree, especially less vaccinated states. saw bad south got close half populations vaccinated much better access monoclonal antibodies....this winter brutal Delta. Cool, bunch data pre-dates mass vaccination. government reach

Washington mandated troops vaccinated smallpox. couple hundred years past ""government overreach"" argument. first state law mandating vaccination goes back 1855. Seriously late. Y'all really leg stand rest us know it. aside argument's medical ethical reasons settled LONG time ago.

Ever wonder old days people many kids? Disease killed kids adulthood not. days mostly gone due vaccines &amp; hygiene. many seem forgotten this... think fresh candidates ballot believe guidance wear mask 3-5 days get tested. need quarantine anything unless develop symptoms test positive. least, that's health department told me. Yeah second dose didnt even get sore arm. ended calling boss telling felt fine work lol. third one took hard. wasnt expecting it! Electrolytes epsom salt baths made suck way less. hope feeling better today!! Cheer up, [Fuck pain That's good nobody able get it.   wasn't.

The debate whether infected community due poor lab practices. You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs funny. sucks we‚Äôve get point. Shhhhh don‚Äôt try reason. 

Their talking points subsequently supporters fueled emotions fear.   know, also save hell lot lives. Obviously none going well sane metric, seems superior - example - US Britain pretending pandemic making feel better blaming unvaccinated ones getting killed.

US still clocking 1500+ deaths day literally pretending happening ""get back work"" whatever capitalist shine want put mass death. Listening particular politician sure bad idea. area expertise (I degree genetics immunology something went much depth still biologist), second article seems proposing mucosal inoculation alternative intramuscular, make claims long-lived response would be. seems proposing ""further research"" rather making strong claims.

The first one news article conspicuously skipped paragraph following reason believe intranasal vaccines would block infection either, experts say could better job existing vaccines, better protecting mucus membranes nose throat.

Realistically, ""sterilising immunity"" unrealistic goal.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* can't figure coronavirus care fake ID they‚Äôre danger people way they‚Äôre danger others remain unvaxxed. always have. covid, high risk people avoid many things health, isn‚Äôt new. world can‚Äôt held back protect few. sounds harsh, it‚Äôs reality.    That's issue here. issue ""private businesses ignore local, state, federal mandates feel like it"".

If business mandated stricter standards local, state, federal, headline that's already common practice several iindustries.

So reiterate, businesses mandate want, can't willy nilly ignore government mandates (at level). since corporations ""people"".  You‚Äôre wrong all, end day life always risk move one point.

Places vaccination requirements longer requiring masks. People love speak masks aren‚Äôt big deal, normal life life return fully we‚Äôre required wear them. people probably continue wear years come, can, requirement needs end.

Barring one million super variant something, best guess spring things start really return normal. People want lives back. 700 lot dead kids. Lots time spent hospital, even survivors, lots resources dedicated taking care them. life-years lost, one dead kid worth lot dead octogenarians.  Check Sun Daily Express articles. cares amendments you‚Äôre infringing peoples right live fear. LOL, really? Absurd?  already it. way easier said done. want avoid it, literally hermit next 5-10yrs maybe more. takes 1 person. Pre vaccines full lockdown possible live like forever. Plus schools open many us don‚Äôt really choice.  always hesitant restrictive laws put place, know vaccine effective helping serious illness, however, vaccines still chance spreading. like people berating unvaccinated since probably infected therefore immunity vaccinated recent studies show. opinion gets downvoted oblivion aren‚Äôt pro-mandates restrictions unvaccinated, whatever reason choose be.  desperate measure. Russia completely messed Covid response. seeing 1k deaths every day OFFICIAL stats (we know reliable are) . population is/was around 150 million   point world cases soar it‚Äôs ok, life normal, mortality rate drops.

Man much unpack much unknown us. saying it'll normal US lets say 100K cases per day extended periods time future, year year out? sure hope wrong that. see allowing transmission go completely uncontrolled good idea. Cases equal hospitalizations, deaths, long term implications. large number multiplied fantastic still significant mortality rate drops.


Mortality course lower prior vaccines. lot people getting sick, even high death, still means lot deaths. Lets assume current mortality rates remain perpetually unable control cases counts future predicting. means metric shit ton people dying time. curve high peaks, area curve.

Personally feel we're coming sort crossroads regard case counts. need see Delta wave plays out, lot people power one foot one foot regard significance cases. Medical advancements withstanding, decision need made.

Eg. CDC can't ask vaccinated people wear mask contain spread, time telling infections irrelevant. We're fucking stupid.  know enough say case, viruses cause myriad long term symptoms too, mean caused COVID reason beware.

Because nature COVID, affecting cardiovascular tissue (endothelial cells primary expresser ACE2 performs function regulating blood flow part angiotensin-renin system) uncertainties regarding direct impact viral binding receptor sites effects related immunological inflammatory responses cellular damage infection, can't say reason stay home.

If turned 10 20 years line majority exposed COVID became unwell cardiovascular disease, people started strokes blood clots, affected gene expression caused cancer, we'd absolutely fucked would late, especially treatments could eradicated approaches gave greater freedom less risk, example better testing tracing stricter shorter effective lockdowns, would regret immensely haste decisions taken governing bodies. pretty much bullshit. Eastern European countries cases pretty robust healthcare social security. hesitate take sick leave needed (and proven EU stats).  one major questions. know, 3-4 weeks shorter average second dose. Additionally, countries spaced doses further, great data picture if/when need boosters.

That said, 3-4 week turn around undeniably right decision (hands down). protection, 65+ dying alarming rate, virus spreading throughout majority population, etc. Extending things even additional months study increased time doses would devastating consequences. Go get booster? every study hospitalization break demographics get higher efficacy group individually entire group whole. example. going get 12-18 year olds enough total data points.

Stupid Putin. Unvaccinated everybody. Taken directly article - 

""Religious medical exemptions permitted."" 

At least that. zero tolerance vaccination appalling. expecting natural immunity proof, US really good picking science believe lately. rest world mostly point though. don't. vaccinated. I'm pointing obvious  main reason peaked summer people still naive virus.

Keep mind, adults flu, multiple times - still much greater immunity.

It may still contagious enough generally kind spread summer, safe assume winter transmission around ~10 times high.  end pandemic people (85-95%) getting vaccinated infected, dropping burden healthcare system. would fine got fired instead.

Fundamentally important thing far let older people (over 50 maybe 70, even vaccinated) get exposed.   knew someone going post comment, emphasized lot data. Oklahoma. agree. I'm 21 friends think knowledgable world people use social media. Social media displays wrong sense world made everything globalized. Also, filters information agree with.

That‚Äôs it! publish data anymore?   Oklahoma weekly reports month two ago? fake certificates much problem low vaccination rates general carelessness observed eastern european countries. unvaccinated, 60 lived Russia. like restriction one compare two beyond me.

I say COVID flu, COVID spread similar flu. know that. seen last year. literally nothing stop cases soaring fall winter, despite lockdowns. We've there, we've seen that.

Vaccines tend mitigate peak, bit. vaccines preventing ~60% infections, still going see like 40% vaccinated get infected sooner later + nearly 100% unvaccinated.

There much it. Locking distancing slow spread, inevitable point thing go around ever.

Maybe easy say retrospect, sure there's region-specific reasons resistance (more rural less affected, mandates on-high, even political party, really get goat).

In August went girls trip 5 girls staying Airbnb, sleeping 2 rooms. healthy, active, thin, mid-late 20s. 

2 us vaccinated 
2 us natural immunity previous COVID 
1 girl unvaccinated, never COVID 

We normal tourist activities day. Day 3, unvaxxed/never-COVID girl SICK af. got progressively worse could barely walk 10 feet without struggling breath. (She also fit us health freak, eats veggies daily, drinks green juice, etc). 

Low behold, COVID. rest us freaking despite vaxxed previous infection. 

We still stayed Airbnb remainder trip (but let room instead sharing). 

We tested re-tested covid none us ever got sick. totally fine. ended staying Airbnb another 2 weeks tested negative. (She didn‚Äôt want travel sick). 

The rest us stayed days make sure never got sick either. vaccines previous infection clearly worked immune systems prepared. 

So that‚Äôs anecdote made conclusion healthy friend must great immune system vaxxed + previous infection. directly negates experience.  Pharma tried it, managed get approved limited subgroups even though missed primary study end points, found, rolling population, effective. Nasal flu vaccines largely disappeared market. give serum immunity mucosal immunity, hence lack sterilising immunity covid vaccines realize abortions contagious. Yes agree saying, original comment left coming outside, important! home need wash hands excessively. skin getting damaged (mine kid diapers) need think risks benefits. 
Hygiene hypothesis (a hypothesis), makes sense me. Needs balanced everything learned basic sanitation though. reason *a* reason. obtuse. anxious person, always think worst comes something occurring within body

190 million Americans received covid vaccine. Serious side effects *astonishingly* rare.

On hand, World Health Organization estimates [between 10% people infected covid experience persistent symptoms ""irrespective initial disease severity"" -- people informally call ""long-covid"".

It's OK anxious vaccine. OK anxious risk side effects, even they're incredibly rare unlikely happen you. need recognize choosing scary thing safe thing -- choosing slightly scary thing (the risk covid vaccine side effects) much, much scarier thing (the risk getting covid, either ending hospital, persistent, potentially life-altering symptoms). worried heart, risks heart damage vaccine astonishing small, risks heart damage contracting covid much, much, much higher. I'm old guy. I've sex 100 women used condom times insisted. (I vasectomy, pregnancy issue.)

Never STD. Yes, recognize I'm lucky. Covid-19 UK like Brexit roaring success Corona viruses. Ok, what? sounds like you‚Äôre upset ability avoid hypothetical mandates anything basis science. It‚Äôs almost like, vaccinating mandates help‚Ä¶ Yes it‚Äôs great respects UK giving us real-time test case data. It‚Äôs already interesting comparison France, Spain, Italy.

I don‚Äôt agree allowing widespread illness SARS-CoV-2 ever going good idea. virus causes systemic illness lasting damage.

Ohhhh right women get abortions save dying childbirth....yep Yep people testing started begging back got terminated.

[archive link anyone trouble accessing article legitimate, understandable argument. legitimate argument young people perfect physical health don‚Äôt need vaccine. That's happens allow virus propagate population, pretty much ""unchecked."" becomes l8teral breeding ground nastiness ... like leave pot rice stove week two. Nobody forcing people get flu vaccine though. COVID vaccines reduce likelihood hospitalization death, transmission still big issue vaccinated unvaccinated individuals responsible. Discrimination basis vaccine whose efficacy vs delta compromised whose clinical trials ongoing okay. That's people complaining about. eric wareheim guy? Yes, yes do. Yeah people feel comfortable asking vaccine status normalize asking STD testing. Define ‚Äúhighly vaccinated‚Äù though. virus ostensibly requires 90-95% vaccination rates it‚Äôs hard say anywhere really highly vaccinated right now. 

What see places 80%+ vaccination, harder time ballooning like earlier waves.

Endemic COVID doesn‚Äôt mean COVID, unfortunately. think title may overgeneralizing friends ask vaccine cards proof meeting dates ""fuck buddies."" also people swipe right vaccinated. 

I agree though factor. also imagine applies liberal, well vaccinated areas conservative places. live NYC. number susceptible low enough new jumps fizzle much sooner. Colorado (which earliest fall wave last year) cases risen, dipped, risen again, dipped again. 

We really need get first doses 5-12s though. That's honeymoons originally for: making couple, often known others days, stay away support networks get close build relationship. Till exactly?

The virus stay highly effective vaccines.

When would consider okay gather (if fully vaxxed)?
There ever point foreseeable future community transmission. headline article says ""no vaccine, sex"" clearly true based alarmingly high STD's. pandemic nothing people using protection sex strangers. pandemic started Florida Health Department sent messages warning rise major STD's. bazillion dollars.. especially bullsh-t ""proof negative test within 48 hrs."" something similar. could literally test negative, contract Covid walking pharmacy positive 48 hours later. absolutely good like someone testing going isolation packed event planning attend happens.  Yes. totally understood hesitant like March April, anymore. It‚Äôs FDA approved, almost year there‚Äôs much data support effective safe. Nothing disagree with. coming years, guy claims, trucking companies fault neglecting rolling stock point enough trucks handle load ports? renewed trucks code use primarily picking cargo ports? failure adopting new rules circumstances failure market? mean, time, choose sit hands instead.... effectiveness infection negligible

This meant stop infection begin with

This also false.

For example, [a recent looking rates infection among nursing home residents (who generally higher risk infection general public) found doses mRNA vaccines 74.7% effective infection among nursing home residents early vaccination program (March‚ÄìMay 2021). June‚ÄìJuly 2021, B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant circulation predominated, effectiveness declined significantly 53.1%.

This significant protection infection. Protection infection one many reasons get vaccinated. No, want fuck daughters, paedo genius compared melted bag skin.

Ah. testing Comrade Dalnore. One must careful anti-revolutionary capitalists seek overthrow workers‚Äô paradise Soviet Union. evidence virus seasonal? isn‚Äôt found. sure is. don‚Äôt care, unvaccinated people need time dwell stupid are, give four months think home. Good, take chance everyone vaccinated I've never understood anybody would allow testing Covid mitigation. go drive through, administer test yourself. pick enough, get negative. somebody really needed negative test, could goof test pretty easily they're ones it. 

They either need tests conducted controlled employee working there, accepting proof vaccine. Rubbing Username checks Seems bit totalitarian dont ya think? I‚Äôm fully vaccinated weary mandates. fan limiting freedoms medical procedures.  Florida STD testing everywhere isnt problem, usually mobile testing centers. People often simply know sadly dont care. drug dealers sharing needles simply carelessly unprotected intercourse everyone.  means sex lie that's first thing thought You‚Äôve shown nothing except you‚Äôll die hill despite logic contrary. quit. made conscious decision. stop stealing killing week also?  months ago something like 96% doctors vaccinated. It‚Äôs probably higher now. always crackpots zealous, vast, vast majority physicians  support vaccination.  Hospitalization 800% since May.

Sometimes using actual numbers useful, percentages misleading. increase 1 8 800% increase, something worry about. 

In case, hospitalisation 7 day rolling figure UK started 109.9 1st, ended 126.9 31st, varied around level, never dipping 100, duration month. Numbers taken UK Gov dashboard. 

The latest 7 day average hospitalisation 848.1. correct \~800% increase, increase level ""oh god, red alert, we're collapse"". given 7 day average hovering around sort level (with blips down) since mid July, there's reason think going suddenly explode higher. time last year vaccine. poorly totally unvaccinated.

Dramatically incorrect. Cases substantially higher right time last year, substantially higher quite time. Despite that, hospitalisation figures bit lower, deaths substantially lower. No. showed it‚Äôs different. It‚Äôs possible virus isn‚Äôt seasonal. Like said, it‚Äôs different.  think rise already, pandemic accelerated it. Luckily since states (Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire) high vaccination rates really experience much surge hospitalizations deaths. example, Vermont's 14-day case average +38% 14-day hospitalization average -5%. expectation dropped higher turned be? would mean guy right, performing quite expected, still good, are. America too, unvaccinated people bad season 8 made people care.  love dictatorships determining unvaccinated can‚Äôt leave homes. Seems ethical me.  one disingenuous here: obviously right none even remotely acceptable long term. So, given there's difference one year, else do? mean shoving back overcrowded schools watch teachers, staff, even classmates die great?

you mean watching world stop pretending give fuck kids getting sick helping?

you mean either full stop total isolation VALLHALLA EVERYTHING'S FINE making happy?

WHO FUCK WOULD THOUGHT

Interesting Upvote don‚Äôt know pattern yet, reason think different flu. past 18 months result brand new virus, thus probably predictive. You‚Äôre willfully seeing parallels point.  TASS Russian means ""Telegraph agency Soviet Union"", abbreviation. Truth *pravda*. can't say general. different strains flu mutate somewhat different rates.

[Here's Trevor Bedford remarking SARS-COV-2 seems mutate faster thread thinks endemic COVID look like. definitely make comparisons flu, especially enter endemic stages. comparisons made contagious respiratory illnesses? differences transmissibility severity render comparisons general behaviour two useless. Covid season going spring summer south fall winter north? Pretty much year round then?

Flu doesn‚Äôt follow pattern. It‚Äôs fall-winter virus throughout US.  YES. Come NY State, thing!

I'll sure pass burger local Mikes Drive In, Super Deluxe, even Little Big Burger. Better food around. It‚Äôs irrelevant mention vaccines performing expectations, still performing exceptionally well alternative treatments.

It‚Äôs better build know of, rather reinvent wheel. would argue treatments would higher potential side effects vaccination.  Mexican breakdown deaths bye age released couple months ago 3-5 y/o lowest lot, iirc 16-17 y/o deaths 10x higher, still really small compared deaths 50+ y/o FDA approved vaccine (Pfizer) falls 50% 6 months (for sake discussion, let's imagine true), booster shots everyone need mandatory ensure herd immunity? Keeping high risk seems short-sighted (again, assumed) drop efficacy. year, could offer protection.

If vaccines change (again sake discussion) - annual booster shots required?  even understand linked? even way misunderstood article, would Long Covid common virus infections make point infections - Long Covid less valid? kind backwards logic that? no, mild case mean virtually safe Long Covid. 20% people mild cases develope Long Covid. Nowhere near ""usually issue mild illness"". Try again. september 9th? that's recent update.

does anyone know happens die post vaccination (NOT VACCINATION) regards numbers?

What general rough percentage positive cases aren‚Äôt sick? haven‚Äôt seen anywhere remember. 30 days Sinovac + Pfizer 90 days second dose doctor btw, feel free fact check anything say. yeah we‚Äôll probably need booster Covid shots every while. It‚Äôs possible they‚Äôll put seasonal flu shot. aren‚Äôt 100% necessary average person. elderly, imunocomprimised people high risk professions, they‚Äôre good idea. currently 55 hospitalized 17 ICU, compare hospitals area (500k people rather 623k vermont) 200 hospitalized 50 ICU (and last weeks 500 hospitalized 100 ICU many died) half vermont's hospitalization. 

so no, vermont anywhere close bad people He's RIGHT though, pandemic over. 

Health officials around world moving epidemic endemic. know difference.  Ah, nice. two doses Coronavac one Pfizer? long doses? [Russia sputnik light - one-shot product likely become country's main vaccine, Russia's sovereign wealth fund** said Wednesday.

At least learned Covid variants. Think getting booster can, let's try get fall winter. like situation. sucks scary, maybe bad fear. 
I know UK maybe England‚Äôs policy allow virus infect everyone deem vulnerable.

in last month 0-11 age range represented 42% vermonts cases... want guess many vaccinated? 

subtract vermont's numbers rising all. data incredibly outdated. Recent studies shown young unvaccinated children safer vaccinated adult age group, (or equal) elderly. Vermont 70% total population, 95% eligible population vaccinated. Anecdotes observations precede hypothesis tested thoughts regarding dropping efficacy vaccine? 
CNN reported study 600,000 veterans, Pfizer vaccine's efficacy dropped 50%...are boosters required majority population obtain herd immunity? 


""The researchers found among 600,000 veterans, J&amp;J's vaccine's protection fell 88% March 3% August. Meanwhile, Moderna's vaccine protection infection fell 64% 92%, Pfizer's declined 50% 91% time period.""  non-Delta lineages died Delta out-competed them.  Ah yes, another vague ""everything changed going back!1!!!11!!!1"" comment tells everything nothing. changed according you? close 85% full vax. shut virus totally down, we've seen vaccines work. live get boosters time time, especially elderly. Living constant fear constant restrictions worse, long term, Covid. they're lagging months, months, months behind.  fuck climate change even this? Sounds like fast food sexual fetish site.  Million dollar question, many hospitalizations vaccinated? many  know powers think, here's think ""end-game"" layperson (Some little US-focused sounding, apply UK whatever country parallels needed):

1. risk ""overwhelming"" hospitals. What's mean? state nurses, need ""surge"" ICU support, calling national guard, cancelling elective procedures. Hospital workers normal 2019 level hours handle patient load.

2. Vaccines toddlers school age children. I'll define toddlers 18+ months here. 


After satisfy conditions, go back normal everything. Now, what's going take hit number 1? Presumably high levels vaccination and/or natural immunity low base levels viral spread. know numbers, maybe someone smarter does. i'm reading CDC age delineated covid risk (updated september 9th), safety risk vaccinated elderly approximately unvaccinated 5 year olds yet boosting elderly so....yeah, science side vaccination

i'm glad asked question wondering myself.  kind sacrifice themselves.

We're really sacrificing though, given death figures remain reasonably see this?

Because there's conclusive scientific evidence long covid is, many folk get it, long lasts for. there's clear answers that, people going take risk particularly seriously. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt get obsession go back exactly 2019. It‚Äôs like asking can‚Äôt go back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù pre internet days.

You serious? understand people want get back time constant worry virus? could friends, family, go out, go cinemas, football, concerts 0 healt worries? wear mask classes, work, transports? 

I mean, get people miss days. talking ""obsession""... like, weird wanting live time without pandemic? Lmao.  It‚Äôs good friend, worries. Yeah startling admit, might necessary.

That isn‚Äôt dumb question, many people one. point wouldn‚Äôt much worry we‚Äôd thing called ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù disease can‚Äôt spread unvaccinated people there‚Äôs many vaccinated people. isn‚Äôt we‚Äôre right now.  temporary, Princess...  complying *state* policies. ignoring *San Francisco‚Äôs* policies. It‚Äôs city policies they‚Äôre fighting. least important metric, one people like OP like bang about, other, important, metrics cause sufficient alarm liking. really trying justify dictatorships? like shortage - simply walk get vaccine. Also information Sputnik light wrong - available, cant pick unless revaccination. got revaccinated week ago without issues even Sputnik V suggested first option. friend mine first vaccination go Sputnik V.

Cant comment countrirs obviously.  worth noting [over 90% UK's population already form immunity COVID-19, either vaccination seems ""herd immunity"" gonna cut control virus.  understanding vast majority cases UK 18 result choosing vaccinate 16 year olds recently, 14% 12-15 year olds fully vaccinated. 1 12 high school students positive Covid week England. 

So lesson UK is, can't totally lift restrictions kids teenagers totally unvaccinated, especially teens, contagious adults gathering larger groups, likely socially distance. fair point admittedly feel dumb providing bad analogy, thank responses.  


I apologize, find somewhat startling topic literally house arresting people refuse vaccine pretty authoritarian... 


I making point government thing help public, slope extend something like heart disease? 


Another dumb question - 99% population vaccinated...and 1% isn't...what danger 1% pose 99%? 12 weeks, UK 86% 12+ population first dose.

[UK covid That‚Äôs lot less thought. Well done. stupid comparison. talking 1 day 1 city entire country around 2 year span. anti-vaxxers sacrificing name science! 
What opposite burning wick ends?! directly false. Everywhere Earth already saw every non-Delta lineage die gave first doses young people, ~two countries given young people third doses seeing Delta die (though soon sure).

I know hate hope around here, okay some. ‚ÄúLong Covid‚Äù illness specific Covid. It‚Äôs something happens many viruses long term complications. Usually issue mild hogging valuable hospital resources Cases one metric - know cannot base public healrg decisions solely based case count Yeah little perplexing me, seems pretty healthy confirm someone vaccinated sex, physically mentally.

And COVID shot WAY better Flu shot. test positive virus mean ill Covid. dictatorship told breathe would refuse? issue many had, believe had, covid may think cannot get believe fight like last time.

Yours very...weird take.   Sweden, Noone FHM made claims natural herd immunity ever strategy plan (and wasnt). people think thay people who's international media decided Sweden strategy.

Seems unfair leave us rot psychopaths want spread disease misinformation. Yup. I'm married, single friends absolutely problem hooking people every weekend. carousel strange. Yeah boosters questionable younger cohorts. 

I read Taiwan slightly covid deaths vaccine covid since well COVID barely spread around 16000 documented cases total somewhere around 22 million jabs.  sure cases pre post vaccination appears mostly prevaccination.

If take numbers would make around 1300 jabs riskier covid case (likely worse youngsters). 

I mean even restrictions USA's covid prevention around 1 8 got COVID 2 years (the amount time 4 covid boosters would cover). 33 times better USA preventing spread covid unrealistic especially since measures work order magnitude.

An initial jab probably gives fair amount long term immunity would decrease helpfulness boosters well subsequent boosters likely going less risky.  People hate stuck indefinite pandemic mode without single concrete goal met. act wearing mask obviously issue.   Yay another win corrupt government! IMO, okay people ignorant new things require large changes. We're living lives, general, people best can.

It's okay experts leaders swayed ignorance, degrade quality broad policies pander lowest common denominator. generate political capital disinformation taken task severe measures available us. trying say 6 months anecdotal valid? outlier backed scientific study? that's case, probably safe assume didnt read study they're taking article says unvaccinated people expect immunity reinfection last 3‚Äì61 months developing COVID-19.

The bad title says ""may"" get 16 months. may also get 3, 10, even 61 according study. poorly worded headline accurately reflect contents study. Maybe would save average would 16 months, even would somewhat better decided go with. 

But probably deep mountain bullshit able properly read study. There's irony gods-damned many knowledgeable, good educators youtube yet algorithm pushing inane shit onto many people.  Great news. Facebook there? three quarters Dutch population least one dose vaccine, means unvaccinated people nine times likely hospitalised.

In reality, quick calculation probably underestimates vaccine's effectiveness, since vaccination levels higher among vulnerable sections population Western countries. thousand cases day country almost 40 million.

""Brutal"".    R &lt; 1 6 months straight?

I really understand people hate much Yup, wrong. takes time vaccine coverage bring cases low (you can't look vaccine coverage see safe, also need look local epidemic is), even then, takes time people get confidence back shake fear. totally expected dynamics. logic makes little sense.  jury's still whether boosters needed, suspect they'll lot people going insist case.

We know correlates protection, easily-measurable number like antibody would correspond ""this much need know immune"". (We've got figured flu took while.) news freaking serum antibody levels waning six months, that's apparently normal response; cells immune memory work point. ""Yes."" disagree, predominantly US-focused site. majority users USA. such, reasonable assume someone mention country/geographic region USA. 

Considering regional nature things like boosters, mention specific country US, question impossible answer.  Don‚Äôt see mask mandates happening bars cannot operate (or barely enforced IE LA). Don‚Äôt see coming back least US. likely vaccinated mandates indoor entertainment. Also highly doubt occupancy limits. There‚Äôs appetite amongst public.  50000 much whatever number mind? seems like arbitrary ""50k seems like big number, make big number smaller"" reasoning.  think plenty that, current system, vulnerable stay home indefinitely, even though right thing, antivax roam free creating new variants.

Mask mandate much easier enforce. normal expected specific vaccines, especially something like coronavirus, lose effectiveness time, already knew this.

Just curious, numbers showing significant changes vaccine efficancy, specifically hospitalization? Something 50-65% range? are, worth mentioning.

Keep mind 1918 pandemic lasted 2 years, without vaccine. Every modern pandemic lasted ~2 years.

This statement best HUGE over-simplification actual picture. people stating natural immunity point [pre-print paper touting previously infected less likely encounter reinfection vaccinated. Overall paper decent NOTABLE issues almost certainly impacted results (reducing numbers reinfections):

1. attempted standardize age, health factors, sex, etc. still notable problems cohorts. example, people die first infection (such immunocompromised) often likely experience breakthrough infection vaccine. selection-bias populations studied inherently biases vaccinated group comes breakthrough infections. 

2. Anyone vaccinated point study dropped trial cohorts. notable issue reduces number infections unvaccinated cohort. example, someone got infected twice changed mind vaccination longer counted.

3. importantly, likelihood get tested (and result get counted positive) showing symptoms significantly higher amongst get vaccinated. already seldom likely get tested again.

Quite simply, controlled studies (such one:[Nature, October 14, utilize mandatory periodic COVID testing large cohorts show ""The effectiveness two doses remains **at least** great protection afforded prior natural infection.""  Even mask mandates probably adhered to. even knows mask is? months since used. UK even planning vaccinate teens currently. teens 18 older actually get vaccinated.

I'm sure they'll easily replaced.   think depends - places review vaccine records bunch vaccines already, accept religious exemption valid excuse. supreme court ruled 100 years ago.

Individual liberties absolute, overall good community outweighs them. That's settled law century.

Where outrage time? 

Your posturing bullshit. Also read article, opinions valid. Read article, get fuck out. It‚Äôll get point eventually‚Ä¶ ""Stay home 4 months? oppressive! this, America?"" /s precedent covers specific situation? mean reverse happens wildfire evacuation orders every year west one bats eye. Everything nothing people. country from? sheer volume people go In-N-Out would make impossible enforce. you‚Äôve ever been, drive-thru‚Äôs insanely long sometimes even break streets themselves. Add getting seat inside waiting poaching game half time. American Christians don‚Äôt consider Catholics Christian.

I‚Äôve baffled many times hearing say it, asking Catholics then.

Many American Christians treat Catholicism like fourth Abrahamic wheel alongside true Christians, Jews, Muslims.  Well sorry say delta, hope son dies tomorrow morning. think avoiding confrontation customers different safety issues? wanna talk bad faith? Bad faith pretending bouncers, bartenders, waitresses, bowling alleys, stadiums, malls dealing bad behaving customers since forever. 

Bad faith pretending patriot act force countless customer facing positions shitty situations.

Bad faith pretending smoking bans went effect, protests assholes starting fights restaurant bar staff.

Customers assholes forever. every customer facing position dealt shit. Forever.

And ya know done society time we've update customers behave? said ""Grow up. **This NEW NORMAL**"" appears impossible. UK demonstrated, moment lift restrictions, cases soar even large majority people vaccinated.

Israel would like word. illegal people working office work home 100 year pandemic.

I swear seems like WANT virus stay us forever spread maximal effect based policies. Nope. article clearly says safety issues. even bother reading article all? NYC similar requirement, restaurants complying minimal issues. In-n-out outlier here, nonsense excuse giving rationale.   Words wisdom US Christian culture, disconnected Christianity.
The US republicans decided make COVID political issue, thus opposite ever Democrats did, US Christian culture followed. really ridiculous. Good! Putin treats workers better here. dont get either. pope fully vaccinated, told others Vatican vaccine mandate. point reason use religion excuse short Jesus coming back saying so. Scotland's flat since start October. England looks exponential period time.    Exactly, I'm sorry struggle. pretty well documented drinking addiction issues way last year, well mental health crises. People coped way could, social end pandemic always going come epidemiological end.  even need meds--depression makes stop giving fuck sex real fast.    evidence virus seasonal?

Here's evidence:

The activities people change based seasons/climate. blistering hot people spend time inside. moderate temperatures people spend time outside. bloody cold, people spend time inside.

People spending time inside results activities spread virus. contrapositive also true.

There's seasonality. Except accelerated mutation rates making virus infectious and/or deadly Long Covid. know initiatives world already, right? mean, also certain ""feature-not-a-bug"" quality well. They're arguing environmental regulations causing backlog shrinks supply, reducing consumption. Reduction consumption unobtanium environmental activism, is.

Edit: clear think unnecessarily reductive nakedly political attempt pin problem single cause. one favorite parts vaccine mandate here. don‚Äôt trust people‚Äôs word vaccinated get bar restaurant dates I'd like see hospitalizations deaths fall pre-vaccine lows. Right significantly higher almost everywhere. guess disagree cautious means, then, sounds like wide open, restrictions me.  Mu R1 one forgot caused panic gone week, cases rise new variant forget indoor activities much higher since cold husband got pregnant end 2019 obviously covid hit. dental school time, high exposure. terrified. would done anything safe effective vaccine protect baby myself. don‚Äôt understand many people railing this. may accept never will. don‚Äôt get go back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. environment changed. go back like movie something. 

Honestly even go back normal (I think like three years time), cascading effects climate change make seem quaint. call fucking cap stupid ass article. Take vote GTFO hahaha What's percentage cases people chosen get vaccinated?

And get vaccinated still developed COVID, evidence systemic illness lasting damage large concern? think we've seen opposite actually, vaccination greatly decreases rates ""long COVID.""  optional third dose Pfizer people got 2 Sinovac(Coronavac) doses (me close friends got it). Non-inmunocompromised people already got 2 Pfizer get third dose later. people actually got AZ due Covax supply issues well clot fears, 60000 so, 60-70y range later got replaced Pfizer.  clearly clickbate anyone following ay4.2 news, VOHC we're discovered, could justify new wave lockdowns. Even becomes problem local area. herd immunity? UK able vaccinate 85% population? even mean?

It fact statistical percentage people going die COVID - percentage far lower fully vaccinated, still nil.

So, follows people catch COVID, people die...

Don't understand it. Probably one biggest scientific breakthroughs life people think going make magnetic. SMH Lol shitty thing say someone  didn't. Imagine trump, fucking dumber.

Probably released without peer reviewed research. highly effective vaccine Russian shat pants rolled out. Russians Eastern Europeans poor non-existent social security. come work mater   end game covid? Vaccines highly effective reducing risks flowing infection. going college 100 percent vaccination rate located city 85 percent vaccination rate, yet people still absolutely hysterical whatsoever small risk (say somebody removing mask second drink something). 

This really leaves hopeless. think risk going become lower today environment 100 percent people already vaccinated. So, logical inference, seems me, protective measures place (and high risk perception comes them) also stay less indefinitely. wrong?  I‚Äôm pro vaccine gets argument bad faith. literally attacks people asking others put masks attacks vaccinations enforced.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Based said article *sounds* like In-N-Out pulling corporate version anti-vaccine doublespeak, old ""everybody free make choices"" ignoring approach harms kills people. totally disagree whole ""enlightened centrist"" approach, idea covid vaccines something ""hands-off"" about.

I agree concept putting ""vaccine police"" responsibility onto low-wage workers service workers. Especially *actual* police, who's job enforce laws ordinances, largely refuse enforce vaccine mandates even comply them.

So society passes responsibility somebody working burger place, grocery store, make enough deal it, security backup, frequently accosted, assaulted, occasionally hurt killed job. People shot this, killed.

So In-N-Out taking two-face low key anti-vaxx approach shitty, true service workers paid enough deal shit like this, responsibility vaccination police get hurt process. know solution is, know workers pretended call ""heroes"" year ago still keeping country running overworked underpaid, deal this.   ""We""

This opinion. start. 

We also much likely satisfy condition first complaint really relevant.  don‚Äôt want shot doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm anti vaxxer. large gulf zero 50,000. think minimal mask requirements good start.  really trying justify breathing? Also lot much older folks real world experience living era polio such, seen benefits vaccines. get food. obtuse. anyone say lockdown? suggestion requiring masks public transit. think Plan B guidelines don‚Äôt recommend lockdowns either. mean, one stopping getting one. Pretty dumb argument. different Employees wash hands going bathroom. refuse food safety police!

Either way, enjoy shut government. half people want show them. Hospital resource levels existed covid bruv, imagine much better average underfunded hospital could run without constant stream obesity related ailmenta would irrelevant told one thing vaccines dropped told something different 6 months later started loose effectiveness even more.  know enough age ranges authorized boosters (or climate, etc) know sure.

i've concerned low vaccination countries since region low vaccination US. i'd kinda like know what's coming takes long look vaccination card look credit card. Half cases children teenagers, cases among adults parents. 
So nothing changed all, except schools session get extra cases compared July August.  'Perfectly' stretch - vaccine perfect - there's nothing inherently wrong Sputnik V. anything, combination two existing platforms - first shot Ad26, like J&amp;J's vaccine, second shot Ad5, like CanSino's vaccine.

Russia done favors active thorough disinformation efforts (nor [accidentally shipping replication-competent Still, likely nothing *wrong* vaccine, getting Sputnik V worlds better getting nothing. Boosters indeed big wildcard. Israel key track coming months. Glad you‚Äôre getting support need partner understands. CA issues SMART health cards every resident, hard enforce all, there's literally app it, apart always flimsy CDC card. get whine vaccinated millions lives lost globally - shrugging behavior what's unacceptable. understand we're learning go pandemic, wonder would ""need"" boosters ended spacing 1st 2 shots farther apart. Perhaps waiting 12 weeks doses would've offered sustained plateau protection? Yeah sure is. family it. Still better getting covid Taking guess: loercase may Alberta, Canada's provincial equivalent Texas. Cases somewhat concentrated result: despite 12% Canada's population, responsible 26% new COVID cases Canada last couple weeks. last week September exceeded 90% surge capacity ICU beds (over 100% rural areas) close activating triage protocols.

Thankfully cases started dropping premier finally implemented common-sense restrictions. That‚Äôs keep saying, vaccinated covid patients tracing cold expensive pcr swab hopes virus r 8 become control. It‚Äôs wishful thinking guys.   Bill de Blasio announced Wednesday New York City require municipal workers‚Äîincluding first responders firefighters police officers‚Äîto get least one vaccine dose October 29th.

Are politicians staff required vaccinated well? Yes. I'm OK dying hill Yes made feel lucky (had Covid December, fatigue lingered month, side effects, got vaccinated). I'm Eastern Europe. Slovakia. Half nation dumb-fucks. Sad, half live them. 46% vaccination rate millions unused vaciness.  Make number 10% lower, 20 less people die day. What's required that? shutting everything that's almost certain. Wear masks indoors possibly. Seems like small inconvenience 20 people die day. Based in-n-out Everyone get vaccinated, children definitely risk well, yet understand mechanism virus stopping people, vastly unvaccinated, developing long term immune response, meaning get severely ill over, die (that happens usually). least 10-20% unvaccinated unable develop immune response months clearing infection, compared 1-2% vaccinated. Everyone gets old, everyone eventually gets underlying conditions. Everyone needs get vaccinated.  Yeah feel same. love n Out, greatly disappointing see siding virus worldwide pandemic. sold beer, they'd ""government police"" check IDs. I'm sick idea business ignore rules like still allowed business. misinformation just... another level, mind, worried wave end meant groundbreaking anyone listens science knows already. boring useless. good news vast majority people vaccinated. avoiding confrontation customers. tolerating violence. In-N-Out making harder end pandemic. Stupid people making harder end pandemic. 23 here. 

I'm expecting humanity make another 20 years. wonder click doomsday bullshit thrown faces endlessly, fact 80¬∞ late October, but, I'm optimistic future. 

I graduated COVID. can't imagine kids feeling nowadays. schoolchildren families schoolchildren supposed testing 2x per week. Many jobs also asking staff 2x week tests Religion zero it. Christianity ban vaccines far know major religion does. People claiming religious exemptions creating religion try claim oppression. I‚Äôm sorry don‚Äôt like answer. U.S., know 8th grade civics class, rights derived constitution system laws. Sadly, constitutional right live fear.  

Again, suggest blame lawyers this. It‚Äôs convenient, it‚Äôs accurate. Please give SWEDISH media claiming strategy going naturally acquired herd immunity rather misrepresentative American media (which keep pointing issue..). besides, neither mentions Swedish strategy. Someone claiming effects natural herd immunity slows infection (which does) someone saying ""our countries strategy going consist restrictions, let people catch disease develop natural herd immunity sole way combating virus"" thing. So, trending covid started? Cases secondary importance serious diseases hospitalizations Call refuse immigration police stop asking proof citizenship green card. Sorry rude. christian though. born different religion athiest. feel religion ruining country science religion cannot coexist. happened dark ages, happening Uh... Yeah, I'll upvote. seem follow usual ""logic.""

Redefines whole ""taking one team"" phrase... like employee doesn‚Äôt get trouble serving alcohol minor minor presents realistic looking fake ID showing 21 wouldn‚Äôt expect employee get trouble tricked forged vaccination card. person using could charged forgery employee tricked would fine. 49,139 cases UK today, that's like 240,000 US cases--UK worst Western world time--Not sure case Christian, lost antivax became ‚Äúreligious‚Äù thing. ‚ÄúScrew everybody else, come first‚Äù far Christ‚Äôs message get.  That's pretty much article states, safety hazard restaurant associates. would unsafe verify vaccines? making unsafe? Obviously unvaccinated. so, clearly tolerating people unsafe behavior, making harder put end pandemic.    Im Culver's man anyway. Granted In-N-Outs Midwest still point stands. different kind casual romance, kind partner significant places Bay Area actually bothering check vaccination status anyways. Really upscale restaurants checking. I'm guessing enforcing In-N-Out recognizable brand touristy location.


The vaccination rate really high though know much matters. In-and-Get-the-Fuck-Out Burgers like it. Oof Absolutely agree. I'm surrounded opposite-minded family nothing complain state, grateful living place governor actively trying kill us. Fortunately science click bait, entertaining findings, blowing minds. unfortunate aspects research arise force researchers compete limited funding seek approval funding getting published research seen may reality, science often ""boring"", somewhat predictable, hat goes researchers putting time collect verify data that's sexy.  onto bullets. Unless one fakes vaccine certificate/card...  okay employees accept proof vaccine, real fake theirs?

Vaccine cards bit different IDs, I'm told many burden get one. comment deleted needlessly political rude, I'm far conservative get. think silly Christians like want pretend shitty Christians ""aren't really Christians,"" that's religion works all. I'm also atheist, skin game. Right, go get ""first shot"". Chances due booster anyway. Self-damage detected. Condition: critical.     way learn check ID anything else.  Imagine ""ordered"" stay home would go US They're not, burgers crap.   "
