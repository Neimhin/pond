That's pretty rough.  agree; however, uncovering pathway severe symptoms mechanisms allows better understand treat lower mortality rates. article good news.

Fast food also poor food. Every fast food ad seems like geared towards low income people, dollar menu shit. five dollars get thousands calories get half much veggies. Also poor people working two jobs raising kids time cook healthy meals necessarily. I'm speechless,and scared ,sigh..... #outrageporn ok lie matter factly give justification? It’s people supposed like “oh it’s cool, lost family thank goodness one bought masks Amazon.” Honestly act saying don’t work doesn’t bother much explanation. said masks don’t work bcuz people refuse wear continue spread microscopic germs eyes onto clothes would’ve accepted it. saying it’s ok lie bcuz didn’t enough? literally say piece cloth greatly reduces spread virus 80 percent. nerve still act confident blunder lie. smug loves attention much refuses go away even wrong time time. way hell idiot knows formulate vaccine Covid 19, even enough know one close. weird going 6 months. seriously feels like 2 months gone by.

Sure can. hospital gets extra funding Covid deaths slap sticker death get bonus. got job Walmart eCommerce people introduced would working gone. someone else say me?? “Charismatic people get promoted.”

Yes, reasoning behind higher position requires “people skills” rather technical. Managing people can’t socialize bad fit. Taking “to live Christ die gain” literally possible, see bring unemployment % numbers down? openings unemployed...Is admin stalling ? 

/S one. called ""America's got Corona"". Filmed live 24/7 across country, showing networks times. mean 1800s? Doctors start washing hands like half century Spanish Flu. He's 4th GOP politician federal state level week. wonder why.

I'm 100% serious! opposite everything Jesus taught! Holy shit hallelujah! Right, ridiculous. People saying weapons mass destruction Iraq invasion, went ahead anyway. one thinking would happen 1,3, 6, 12 months invasion. ridiculous political stunt, similar devastation Tru mp's attempts get political gains coronavirus. Getting morons riled vote interests nothing new. Barely even scratching surface point Complete Trump-speak, refusal answer question asked take responsibility issue hand.

That's said one acquires - Trump inherited it, dad someone bloodline acquired it.

Whether cons, connections, innovation timing, exceptional quality originally led wealth. Tax breaks rich? Unfortunately that's way lot employment contracts go. Amazon famous it. I've encountered disturbing number anecdotes people 30s used healthy mildly ill virus months ago suddenly dying heart failure.

Wait number people made sterile virus becomes known virus perfectly capable attacking testes directly.

Here's one study topic suggests may serious problem needs study:  already said person online. first in-person service since lockdown started Alabama today lesser capacity ensure social distancing, lot churches state already opened back in-person services weeks ago. also church coordinated Covid-19 testing Birmingham, one harder hit cities beginning this. personally agree online, feel like risk average Alabama citizen going knows day, good amount (unfortunately) wearing masks improperly all. get title causes knee-jerk reaction church really trying keep people safer average church. Last reply. Read article. Really? lunch. Ask black person whites minority. Maybe 6 months. Honestly keep prosecuting churches ask people [Just case still lackey Nah Bill Gates track us read minds, we'll follow commands Suck know way things shaping up, rate, world's going see end time soon unfortunately. One hope least slow progress. 1918 knew masks worked , Asians knew January , still scientists America didn’t? weird you? Well... what? Oh yeah, let's schools open!!! Thank service  cursed comments Please come live city. entire eastern seaboard? I'm actually sure agreeing not. White people minority talking man nuts, wait til try beef stroganoff. far one best reddit posts school!!!! enjoyed reading sides parents teachers! first time saw many teachers really explaining face face important - yes son needs since trained speech therapist teacher much tweeted Make America Great Again, else do.you want? /s Even better news.. Anti mask people also believe vaccines. interesting funny. people religion too. It’s belief point. can’t change mind doesn’t want hear it. ""The Trump train brakes."" swear it. Take 500 mg glutathione 1,000 mg vitamin C daily. Myocarditis new condition, though. rare complication many virus-infections (incidences 10-35 1000 confirmed cases) .

It take years clear completely, cases never (AFAIK 25% so).

So, given numbers low balling everything, would mean half corona-cases experience myocarditis, several months several years - time entirely unable exercise due danger exacerbating problem. 

One eight people end permanent damage heart (25% 50% = 12.5%).

This give general idea expect, might bit better whole lot worse. exactly great outlook, ask me. stupid politicians stingy hell... isn’t people trying themselves....pathetic discussion isn’t gathering large groups though. It’s making criminal charge drink park, Draconian. heard limbs hacked off. would happen? test tho. Yup. Taiwan’s response closest example have. wife tested April surgery (required). Last week, contact person covid positive. Another test another negative her. real world example. becomes available, Dr. Fakey play God decide gets first? know, like lied masks. South korea. educating citizens facts. Minimize disinformation opposed president promoting disinformation Naw UK like 70-120 deaths day last weeks. well compared rest Europe. news really. It’s happening America since pandemic began. many people don’t care won’t happen them. Something looked wrong 32 year old story.

Like asthma. dude genetic condition sort. looks like poor specimen human Lots mask wearing crowds distancing think spreading going naive best. Personally would want see affects fertility taking except even woman like three years probably issue. coworker cunt. Happy to. Feel free share something shows lasting immunity. would great news.

This seems suggest otherwise.

Reinfections seasonal coronaviruses occur nature, usually within three years [20]. However, elapsed time infections mean protective immunity lasted period time, reinfection also dependent re-exposure. Based minimum infection intervals observed dynamics antibody waning, study showed duration protective immunity may last 6 12 months. results line model protective immunity reinfection dynamics HCoV-OC43 HCoV-HKU1 estimated period protective immunity 45 weeks [21]. Primary infection SARS-CoV-2 shown protect rhesus macaques subsequent challenge casts doubts reports re-positivity observed discharged patients due re-infection Stupid people game feel like taking crazy pills. People Magazine well cited article actual news. like trust Birx. Trump ass-kisser. trump anti-mask 

I saw video Trump promoting masks. clear it, calling ""patriotic"" all. Trump related anti masks promotes use wears regularly? Well wrong ...you watched live feed displays section park ok cool good know strict is...yes PA system reminds every idk 20-30 seconds....were talking yelling person mask maybe 10 second around noone someone yelling like freaking Nazis..why would lie saw someone take mask idk maybe 3 seconds sitting empty Mariachi performance Epcot one around saw distance (like 20-30 feet passing) cast member comes waves hands front repramands her...I literally looking live feeds literally lines/shops/outside/inside/bathrooms/security/gift shops/parking lots signs seeing real screen... No, want closed virus low enough levels effectively test trace. still completely control half nation. economic activity virus contained. Enjoy prize Tom Barrett, deserve it. flu like? young people die flu underlying issues.

Difference magnitude sure Looking forward it!! Phlebotomy art imho. slightest. Titles like spread misinformation, implies average person die catch covid. necessary emphasize specifics give people truthful picture make decisions based rationality rather fear. First Corona beer, Heath bars... It’s same. low prevalence setting (like parts world) majority positive results false positives people expose thought safe. It’s spreading, doesn’t matter spread expose yourself. Tell Karl-Anthony Towns whose mother died virus. Agreed, un-American restricting people's freedom. Someone's projecting Well, yeah, essential workers. selfish you. Plenty people deserving you. Maybe they’ll drink “special elixir” meetings too. It’s okay, stardust ascends space eternity, “souls live paradise.”

Much Americans en masse don’t listen science already, expect thing less intense religious zealotry US. Uhh, ""new phase"" we're currently started states started re-opening soon. next ""phase"" school-associated spread starts. Yup, used mine pay bit credit card debt get fix car months back... even cover all. gone 24 hours fiance honeymoon planned October. Decided reschedule next March back June, good choice. may reschedule vaccine available point. Fingers crossed. Even comfortable going, experience neutered right continue numbers low vaccine widely available. 

While necessarily agree parks open right now, strict mask use distancing, pretty stringent cleaning standards. guess they're best since open.   tangible video Twin Towers collapsing profoundly impacted people way footage past six months could.

I mean footage covid could, shown.  

We could show people's limbs hacked due Covid complicatuons rows grandmas, grandpa's 40 yr olds medically induced comas literally dying tubes throats. can't help notice GOP politicians tend test positive Democratic ones. Yes say Fauci. extremely angry that. countries didn’t lie citizens. .....Seriously? 9/11 caused human agency. Non-white, non-Christian agency. Covid-19 germ. Yes Yeah can’t draw complete blueprint think that’s basic idea. want billions robot drones pumping surpluses redistributed cleanly directly.

PS: can’t tear whole welfare state replace basic income, transition towards state basic income replaces/obviates need much it. Clearly, aren’t *other countries*. 

So thank you. Duly noted. Okay Benghazis? everyone around world... God exist! zero proof. Wake up. long old people cares? 

Trump 2020. also didnt even attempt start wearing masks almost 700,000 died... we're halfway 100k WHAT. went way overboard that. love comment. ya gonna learn today 🎵 Mid Management really do? really think it. Walmart business selling groceries appliances. need absolute top management grand strategies, relatively thin middle management local sourcing&amp;related H&amp;R. Although really think it, local store level H&amp;R could managed store managers.

It's automatization, people talking longest time hit especially mid managament, i.e corporate office jobs. Sure, people still talk employees needing frequent contact relationship superiors coworkers, really contemporary capitalism anymore. People supposed extremely self directed efficient, can't operate self-directed manner based job responsibilities or/and can't efficiently get boot. course still high tech increased need communication interpersonal relations, that's walmart. Many companies nowhere near 'high tech', produce relatively simple services get paid that. companies employees like gears, one work fix (more training) replace it. may like it, called 'efficiency' makes sure services produced cheaply possible, people tend like cheap. you’re bubble u even need mask? r/holup That's true. Almost half people blindly follow counter-narrative instead. Count lucky then, tetanus shots suck bad getting disease itself!!! that's pretty much approach vaccines. China ideal model. Censor media. jail jail jail reeducate. Stomping criticism silencing voices permanently necessary. USA right Portland, got sloppy left alive. exactly spread news sources fast. Probably busy wishing still Obama wheel ... PE May honestly thought going die. think they'd preemptively put blood thinner? experts right accurate last six months? Fauci D-, give us better A-list names follow. phase 3, go 2 weeks get first injection part trial. People shrug they’re numb death. worn mask. stayed home. early deaths tragic. didn’t know.

You function high alert mode week two lose it. unimaginable becomes normal. doubles, doubles doubles doubles. already reached breaking point turn news stop reading numbers.

I can’t give shit without affecting work shitfaced get. Well prove anything; snorted viral peptides never exposed.  Yea...those guys ethopia barely chipping in. Screw them, deserve get.  /s Yeah, remember flu shots made feel weather days. attitude I’d rather feel kinda bit bedridden two weeks misery hooked ventilator. confirm, managed get shingles 11. I’m still young vaccine (I’m 29) really really don’t want Yeah going big game Trust, it? actually great idea.  numb it.  Blast everyone unlockable notifications new infections. Schools made difference countries. 

Fucking get it. HBO show 1918 pandemic. they're showing protest something? Seeing Reddit guess depends they're protesting...

I swear people cheering virus make everyone's lives miserable shut-in existences.   That's vaccines do. want vaccines that, want *treatments* *remedies*. Hmmm - care, memory serves me......

- HSBC Holdings' (NYSE:HBC) agreement pay $1.9 billion fine regulators enter deferred prosecution agreement points lack adequate control processes compliance anti-money laundering. Given bank's size, appears peers big jail big fail. agreement constitutes warning bank clean act avoids revocation charter operate United States. action taken regulators belief failure large financial institution could imperil world's financial system. Ebola. Hantavirus. Bubonic plague. Legionnaires. Measles. Avian Influenza. Covid.

You pick one infected with. pick?

Exactly.  Quarantine 2 weeks see what's option, go lick handrails? would nice put much importance many lives line annoying voice. easily correlate social distancing compliance/mask wearing rate spread

I'll leave [this recent here.

Turns 90% masks wearing protect aerosol transmission fun fact, viral load aerosol breathe enough infect. no, help nearly much think that's exact reason mask based studies droplet transmission aerosol.

I'm sure heard correlation cited though news program never research back though. forgiven.  leader definitely gives fuck, way think.

Just like 9/11, current administration trying use virus advantage.

They gaslight, misinform, put followers risk slim chance virus lot dirty work.

I convinced *want* virus ripple country gamble infect disrupt political enemies voting base.

They willing let followers die chance virus things like infect protestors ICE detention centers.

Why think uppity people shitting Columbus try passively weaponize germs? Like dare anyone criticize person whose playbook running right now. Also soon anyone starts getting virus starts lose.

It gone overnight. every needle gives disease one less pathway run eventually runs options.

We get healthier others get I'll wait turn happily. Besides, aren’t side effects suggestive light inflammation immune system reactions? thing want vaccine?

IIRC vaccines even contain additives supposed increase immune reaction locally.

For may know: exceptions (BCG, oral polio) vaccines nowadays contain live pathogens. risk actually contracting disease vaccine itself. unlike, say, smallpox vaccine, relied localised infection vaccinia poxvirus could get hand unlucky.  found loophole. lmao imagine getting headache arm Well ship good run. Send demolition team aboard. ""Hello, shingles? It'sa me, mariospants."" Yeah, competition post-BvS huge tennis racket end, give twice..... . Like said remember reading something specially giving due pandemic issues come forth, one extream times it’s permitted not. may local test something, trying find source now.

To clarify, don’t need placebo group reason well. control group vaccine. don’t want people thinking don’t. *""Making inherently flawed comparison, Trump blamed America’s high infection numbers “much testing country world.” analogy akin saying pregnancy tests lead pregnancies.""*

LOL, called ""more testing excuse"". time. turn summers next years. Let kids year round. I'm old young enough remember first months school summer getting us back left off. Especially math. 

So skip next summers way play catch-up. 

But really kids learning. wanting economy get back ""normal"" parents wanting kids house. could try, he’ll jump project headfirst. I'm still trying figure side Birx on. days feel Trump lackey, days intelligent professional. think knows what's right trying tow company line. emotions Trump's ""inject bleach"" fiasco said all. wanted scream bit tongue thinking ""what imbecile guy is"" It’s try sub tbh Fuck thay douche bag. Vaccine producers release ready worry pandering politicians trolling people expense public health. Thank you, kind say. 

An open mind ability engage objectively without spouting insults difficult some. 

Interesting get people get ‘triggered’ someone else applying logic something non-political (medical qualifications personal real world action) ... turn generates insults subjective political ranting... 

I’d agree you, much argument. safe well. long one dude hospital for? came $1.1m. thankfully good insurance. paid pretty much examples made come conclusion? Darwin laughing loud. I’ve pretty bad anxiety virus ever since pandemic started, started calm last couple months...

But news shockingly large amount people ending heart damage extremely worried pretty much constantly last week since first heard it. wasn’t worried would end dying get infected, I’m mid 20s generally healthy careful.

But I’m worried get infected, somebody close isn’t careful, even none us die right, might end getting heart damage end rough life end dying couple years road heart attack something.

Is anything reassuring anyone offer particular development comes virus? context discovery could ease mind? Hows that? got RGB mousepad Amazon day $16 day. can't get important injection generation people fucking next summer? second quarter 2021 projection seems long frankly good enough. parents Huntsville one educated cities US parents taking serious wearing mask. rest State away many morons per capita. eat lot paint chips kid? I'm done arguing back forth basic facts since refuse listen cite anything maybe listen people, heres top results elasticity food american healthcare prices google

elasticity healthcare facts inelasticity food Whatever cults religions whatever, citizens free democratic nations ""forced"" wear ""face coverings"".

China chuckling back many months ago, countries reprimanded criticizing PRC ""draconian"" violating rights citizens. Bud, vaccine giant suppository I’d take thing straight pooper. Lube let’s fuckin go. Well, church seems full Pharisees!! 

Also, regarding, Matthew 18:19-20, can’t closed prayer groups 2-3 people based verse? would make sense pompous show religion. many words almost nothing value said. felt like author reaching hard possibly could find negatives surrounding good news. 

Oh really? switch immediately eliminates disease planet? idea. might take weeks build immunity? Well damn, might well get then. might strain distribution? win Covid, guess settle getting health care workers, high risk individuals first. Religious nutters... Omg give hope A) cares. Let anti-vaxers infect want.
 
B) Many reputable sources taking possible availability around time frame.

BTW, ""you're"" you’re incorrect, anti maskers aren’t anti vaxxers. anti-masker per say wear one people ask don’t give friction. Lot people anti maskers don’t like forced stuff. won’t accept Corona vaccines, like military people rejecting anthrax first came out. You’re summarizing inaccurate, judging people know.  feel slightly better people reacted way 100 years ago. doesn’t make current reality better, I’m heartened proof stupidity isn’t new. Durr America bad gib upvotes ones house. So, guy works regular worker structure, kind management allows ""job"" part job self-manage. Upper management mostly goes meetings trying solve structural organizational challenges setting broad objectives. direct manager VP 250 people reporting allows upper management 250 different points contact. job basically making sure job effectively spending time interpreting half-baked ideas attending structural meetings.  socially distancing! Preseason risk, reward. Similarly cut camp rosters safe staying fuck home. That's great hear. would never suggest lifestyle intervention alone patients either. 

I think research future show diet higher fats would beneficial lowering patient's A1C levels. Fats produce longer satiety without spiking insulin intake. assume 1 gram daily 500 BID, great. hope ditch metformin road. 

My point simply estimate body's innate ability heal itself. everyone send Godly donations venmo. Well fuck. waiting either got vaccinated whole thing blew getting another job. sure I'll savings hold mid 2021. Life's gonna get interesting. Friday, Sunday man. read two days ago.

Still damn shame. Fly Eagles Fly “phase” politicians something starts get better? would “Politically Correct” answer... use boat RELAX man lol. Oxfords vaccine September. Pfizer October. 100 million doses Oxfords vaccine. guessing facts (and generally I’m good guessing thankfully) like hold bleach/hydroxy Thank you. actually reminds potential in-laws... They’ll line fuck dear leader starts ringing bell school Indiana mentioned indeed rational policy ""Positive child close contacts must quarantine 14 days"".

One simply wonder even bothered trying go back school one case enough close back down. Grocery stores fast food places begging workers. one wants work $600 per week. Almost businesses require masks workers customers makes safer pandemic started. many lazy people country. It’s time get back work! rich people. bacon... Shit, see cancelled preseason. indication going see regular season? “Trump blamed America’s high infection numbers “much testing country world.” analogy akin saying pregnancy tests lead pregnancies.” Lol least they'll antibodies, amirite!? one else pause statement travelled 14 different states? meetings could done zoom - stop travelling! Oh yes, I've heard transmittable facial cancer nearly wiped Tasmanian devils. American. want leadership actually lead anything right now. make things worse. noble meantime, states like Lousiana, Tennesee starting see huge spikes. imagine Chinese pay everyone’s vaccine fees. Agent orange next health secretary pretty incredible global pandemic we've modern times. never said left 🥴 stated comment above, unfortunately Pharisee-like people reasons Christianity gets much hate. Jesus said Pharisees aren’t Christians. Pharisees actually ones sentenced Jesus death. yeah, real Christians real Christianity isn’t like that... seems though there’s Pharisees real Christians today 😐 hell world live in. Unfortunately they're defying permit revoke still opening up. They're even encouraging people donate pay lawyer. Yeah me, I’d rather dad sister get risk do. bleach injections Fun fact, Georgia Tech. U(sic)GA, men coughing mouths gain herd immunity. I’m hoping return point I’d rather honest. Man I’m jealous. I’ve worked family’s machine shop every single week day. We’ve set shifts try separate people much possible steel parts can’t made home Man, watching handmaids tale really gave false idea Canadians would really welcoming ever run away fascism. China India negative stereotypes different areas.

China stereotyped cunning, dictatorial, weird meat eating savages.

India stereotyped weird rapey, perverted savages.

For reason, Africa also get negative rap even though wet markets get common Africa. could reddit already written Africa reddit barely identify single African country. Fasting raise infection death rate. virus. Enjoy downvotes. I’m giving asked for, happy now. scientific record disagrees. USA, flu seasons 1960, 1963, 1969 1976 higher monthly mortality rates per 100,000 population COVID19 did.

[See sources:

* [graph historic USA flu mortality Figure 2B [The monthly COVID deaths USA Column 2 Table 1 monthly deaths multiplied 100,000/(USA population) get deaths/100,000 population

There [interesting writeup 1976 flu US Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) lost credibility ’76 swine flu affair
* time, generally recognized rating system describe potential pandemic. 
* Political decision-makers consistently thought scientists giving choice go ahead mass immunization programme.
* vaccine rushed through, dozens cases Guillain–Barré syndrome it. may started anti-vax movement. controls numbers now? White House. THWG Hope Votto normal flu bug something. Russia threat all, China is. trust GDP numbers (questionable), notice economy growing America's decimated. US currently interested leadership role. leave CCP. things never change.. Even every single one caught it, 4 5 would walking around 2 weeks saying they're fine. plus side, openings happen, clear teachers would know ""the teacher's union incredible amounts power."" teachers' union said ""we're going back without masks"" made clear they'd strike get masks, city fold. Protect immunocompromised ages elderly first rest us make due. Bringing pandemic size... turned down, bummer sent home one person, I'd say bunch going Lol, still talking point? cases, deaths hospitalizations going well. Yes. can't. Lmao depends perspective. view it’s totally joke. rich, it’s genius working perfectly planned. It’s probably much closer reported countries help anything 101 
Schools going spread virus way typical store. teach middle school high school it’s 150-300 students teachers see week. Schools higher risk exposure small enclosed spaces 7 hours, recycled air, hundreds students using bathrooms etc. many students won’t show symptoms means going spread even more. 1/4 teachers US considered high risk, millions students care elderly family members. Reopening schools without strict measures devastating. MIL teacher school student placed foster care grandmother died COVID another student lost 3 family members 2 weeks. I'm right you, wearing mask makes hard breathe well. still wear serious discomfort small price pay helping others. I'd rather risk wellbeing risk lives around me. sacrifice difficult every single day, pride hope bright future. that's means American. Exactly. 

People cannot connect important dot wearing mask public health issue. freedom. politics. simply need wear mask prevent spreading disease. 

If believe able refuse mask, hope also adamant protecting right wear seat belt, right public intoxication, right nude public. numbers would’ve seen numbers White House publish? seems inevitable come criteria changed presumptive cases dropped count, presumptive deaths dropped count, etc..  Target: read One Piece now! That's exactly point. kind tag designed tamper-proof mandatory wear.

  Travellers Singapore required activate device, use GPS Bluetooth signals, upon reaching home receive notifications device must acknowledge. mum step dad, dint make clear enough I?

Apologies. want see language that's used CCP here. corrupt, face-saving disgusting. honestly longer see difference. mean trump pretty much tries thing like dictator. I've ostracized whole life American saying to/about people military, they've done nothing protect freedoms, killing brown people collecting paycheck military industrial complex.

Sucks see many people die, pretty vindicating proof beyond doubt every soldier past 20 years bloodthirsty racists never cared America American lives. Everyone wearing mask. effective that? Around 2.77% world population died. effective then. Percentage world population died Covid-19? 0.008% favorite game kids anyway, kicking lol I’ve seen interstate drive Maryland Columbus disrespect, dad died last year yet fighting wearing mask? Depends long lasts after. Sometimes flu shot get extremely tired sore burning eyes 1 day after... I'd still rather flu, 2018s flu knocked ass 2 weeks  What’s crazy every year this, flu vaccine season, line was, “Healthy people don’t die flu. It’s dangerous.” Deferral authority really gets me. Back February kind freaking prepping isolating one know nothing making light warning them. response usually 'if serious government would something it'. course response con man idiot charge government.  

The fact stacked good-sized city bodies since still people February attitudes kind exasperating. watching worldometer multiple times daily since March. number new infections/day plateauing, deaths increasing. minor dips spikes different states correct reporting, I'm seeing claiming see. Source anti mask sentiment incredibly strong? That's outright false claim yet another attempt campaign destroying image Sweden. sure mods allow sort stuff keep getting posted far I'm concerned ships fucking sunk everyone board. braindead selfish enough get goddamn ***cruise ship*** stage, that's deserve.  documented permission sell shared compliance team. probably made request week ago. Maybe recognises shares (regardless sugmccesses failures) going tank wants put gold. CDC? Sweden way.

It mean everything okay means worrying schools overblown really need people stop spreading bars beaches choose show deaths per day Spain, Italy U.K., 7-day average Sweden?

Is chance makes Sweden look similar rest? Ugh. don’t worry US schools immune tells us much medicine developed, stats showed significant difference growth virus countries use masks compared without. Clearly studies showing correlation low IQ refusing masks related, correct :) Tbf 1200 day still less half ~2850. hilarious (in sad way) many times I've seen people use quote justify they're bothered, reason Stalin said complete sociopath, like violent dictators. normal, good person, still supposed find many deaths disturbing, even hard picture huge mass people dying. get frustrated seeing YouTube comments anti mask, anti quarentine, saying ruse government control people... get pissed people actually attending anti quarentine rallies. hate fucking stupid argentinian people be, say argie. odd article change world quickly. ""change world"" means going back 5 months ago. Seems strange we're far removed normal would world changing go back 5 months ago. Sweden president literally fans flames social unrest pandemic, consequence driving political opponents take streets risk infection, I'm sure dismiss possibility administration trying utilize virus literal political weapon easily you.

Don't forget scenarios, Commander Turd's ""side"" mysteriously readily equipped top line gas masks PPE global shortage...fascinating... Fascinating, isnt it? know knowledgeable topic yet still feel need strong opinion it. human brain works mysterious ways. still can't enter Canada without essential need, like dying relative. live Maine lots towns along border people used going back forth shop, visit friends family forth. difficult time them, understandably. they'd say hyping up. way 300K could die. alarmist! Etc  makes sense, educated public means massive drop Republican voters. Get rid educators, problem solved! Systemic thinking scale isn’t something many people even capable of. It’s anti-intellectualism that’s preventing people listening looking systems interact making recommendations based data analysis.

It seems cold don’t understand don’t trust done try reduce overall amount damage, harm loss life longer time-scale. It’s sacrificing lives, it’s looking ripple butterfly effects trickling systems causes harm death future.

We wearing masks taking precautions don’t lockdown long. part, unfortunately we’re going to, everything would better across multiple systems. It’s absolutely true extended lockdown cause huge amount “net harm” needs addressed answer wear fucking masks, take precautions stop acting like selfish asshats. bad that’s big ask adult children there. realized ago, people repeat themselves, history. say ""those read history, doomed repeat it"" point. Impossible. systemically brainwashed think can't strike. Like, walk got strike. I'm sorry loss. think frustrating pro-life idiots ones advocating loudest deaths. truly bizarre. 

A couple coworkers gone disease (one tested positive, waiting results). brother symptoms March get test. mother's doctor treating glaucoma died it. Yet parents say know anyone caught think hoax. really frustrating. 

They told weirdest story today phone them. friend paramedic girlfriend works ICU hospital. According friend, hospital seen COVID cases big scam. Yet hung call googled hospital's COVID stats, they've hundreds deaths... including healthcare workers treating patients. I'm sad medical professionals front lines treating sick people pretending they're not. exactly? Attention? Meanwhile convince gullible people like parents careless possibly end hospital. Guys sacrifice economy. mean modern day nazi Germany, mean united states Murica several people work testing positive almost half symptoms all. strongly suspect number people infected way, way higher 18 million worldwide. Always remember 9/11 matter fucking what. also indeed means remember COVID-19 utter bullshit response Trump entire fuckwad administration try kill many people possible. US cancer trying kill it. makes wonder. stupid hanging cloth mouth 2020 technology advancements. someone told 1918 still wear mask face century later never believe him. know mask fabric changed lot. cheap papr system help people breath achieve better seal. even doctors nurses dont these. imaging poor patients lung damage breath fabric. wonder people covid dont like wear masks. families visiting tromping human poop urine soaked soil might... yeah know, sorry saying wanted get poeple depressed. trying get Energie play rules couple month quitting makeing everthing even worse. strikes people think great time go cruise also think hoax get it. Buddy, already track threw phone, smart watch... things willing have, won’t bother vaccines  infinite wisdom, realize clearly typo? get paid I'm gonna throw links (too political), guys definitely check lady (Li-Meng Yan) pushing hydroxychloroquine Bannon's war room.

I'm starting wonder see nurses beaten hospitals getting burned morons' family member die blame others (including Chyna) refusing give HCQ. people tha brought Seasick: horror cruiser: 
Seasick 2: Rig terror Gift givers bus chasers laughed laughed laughed ... cough. Another cough. thought Snow White 7 Dwarves.

*Oh wait, apple juice. can't outrace guy serialized shit particles room 5 minutes got there... states authority closing opening trump know know, really feel like debate come argue - there's genuine interest learning already concreted lack merit (dad extremely anti evolution, I'm tired) Separately, whole ‘protests didn’t spread rona’ meme came free testing contact tracing done post protests Boston. look back pics early protests Boston, see almost everyone wearing mask.

Now go back pics California first protests see many wearing masks. weren’t. oh that's liberal hoax...

/also unfortunately Holy fuck. Anti-science anti-intellectual people feel need know things mainstream doesnt. makes feel clever. compensates life-long insecurity. believe snake oil conspiracy theories. Portraying hydroxychloroquine forbidden cure allows pro-Trump media blame anyone Trump coronavirus disaster. telling, COVID-19 could cured months ago hydroxychloroquine, Democrats, media, Dr. Anthony Fauci would listened Trump! I'm still living phase 1 life family healthcare y'all trying kill. sister RN whole family infected.  wife also RN.  yeah, restaurant since February. ppl desperate get time away kids willing let others die?? quit job? show dream love something like ""over 50 asthma"" painted death's door lol. learned freedom important health people even acting causes another lockdown. lockdown=freedom? really? stupid...🤦🏻‍♂️ almost always cautious person hoping would way pro sports health supportive possible. Partly sports give many people joy many people end rope need something put minds on. hoping outside outside usually shows less risk maybe MLB could happen. NFL already seemed problematic much contact. 

But see wrong. fair players families increase exposure them. :/ Sports wonderful pastime life-and-death lives depending it. 

-Ravens fan. :( Good know there's plan! worry, less kids Maybe hats entire time... saying without vaccine 100000 people would die population 100 Million, vaccine 10000 people would die population 100 Million. ain't comin without mask don’t take responsibility ever. never thought people actually dumb thought. turns way way dumber could imagined. reality: every teacher get away job year, even instruction ends pretty much online. year, virus still going on, teachers going start losing jobs. Why? it’s going become apparent everybody employing art teachers, gym teachers, coaches, band directors, jobs cannot effectively done online, pointless waste money. It’s going happen.

After types jobs eliminated save money, core subject teachers next chopping block. become obvious many school districts states much cost-effective one teacher teaching hundreds kids online subject bunch teachers teaching 25-30 kids time. 

We totally replaceable, online teaching programs fantastic already, pandemic make education/curriculum companies make even better products. None jobs safe. Even year ago, felt secure teaching job, likelihood replaced forms technology seems ludicrous, are. pandemic lasts beyond year, definitely will, teaching jobs going start eliminated. Online learning future anyway, future here. replaceable, like every profession, communities, cities, states going want keep paying teachers salaries teachers go work.

At point, think it’s inevitable school districts throughout country resort online instruction September. football season fall sports definitely canceled, it’s inevitable. Suppose scenarios come through. hell gym art teachers going effectively teach online? band director? football coach district makes $100k+? I’m telling you, point isn’t going money pay people like this, especially find midst giant recession.

Our jobs safe year, that’s it. Online learning going replace hell lot teachers, hell lot teachers going find job completely relevant pandemic face-to-face interactions aren’t permitted. math teacher, would like think job likely survive jobs gym teachers, teachers, band directors, coaches, know better. replaced. It’s reality need take account soon. Lmao 9/11 great. Could destroy civil rights, destroy countries destroy people color.

This requires showing responsibility, loses interest within 5 seconds think biggest bump came people interpreted condoning protests sign authorities weren’t serious virus. would another instance short-sighted policy decision would prove severe consequences mere weeks later. Exactly. people bleeding form eyes coughing blood street everyone like, whatever. think understand lack merit argument discount existence argument, validity argument. protests started 3 days Memorial Day. doubt holiday factor - least Houston *know* without doubt cases tied protests based reports infected people themselves. won’t get much hard evidence - contact tracing response percentages abysmal, places (eg, NYC) banned asking protest participation.

Still, think biggest bump came people interpreted condoning protests sign authorities weren’t serious virus. would another instance short-sighted policy decision would prove severe consequences mere weeks later. absolute morons that’s plan. way Republicans Democrats I’m vulnerable age brackets. don’t think that’s end game here. aren’t dying dramatic fashion. deaths traumatizing.

I hope UK treating family well
Much love Southern-most part Africa! Yeah tests friends done regular Covid-19 tests that’s think article talking study. &amp;#x200B;

State income sales tax revenue plummeted, and, without sizeable Congressional bailout, tens thousands teachers risk losing jobs coming months. Georgia’s state legislature, example, cut $950 million K-12 budget last month. Nevada’s state legislature month debating proposal cut budget $156 million, almost quarter state’s K-12 public-school spending.

The rest nation’s state legislatures waiting set budgets Congress decides later month whether provide another stimulus package schools. means unusually large number teachers could lose jobs right before—or possibly after—the school year starts.

Laying teachers emotionally fraught demoralizing process community. Layoffs often result significantly lower academic outcomes, according research Katharine Strunk, researcher Michigan State University studied education labor markets.

“Layoffs create massive churn mobility across schools within schools,” said Strunk. pointed layoffs likely occur schools high numbers low-income, Black, Latino students. “A lot kids experienced lot of trauma coming pandemic. need see familiar faces come back schools left.” mean. Kids raised single parent especially kids without father house/communities less father's around way worse way around.

They blaming collapse beaver cleaver Dreamworld. saying quit bitching, America systemically racist, stop blaming problems life I'm fine chilling here. Anyone wearing mask sacrificing everyone else. deserve nothing Combo masks, people saying ""oh shit"", testing limit. good thing case numbers percent positive seem stopped increasing. means that, September 1st rolls around, 205,000 people dead United States. Oh, well, case... hope you, family friends stay well. ❤️ fails happen testing people proof COVID ""suspected"" did. simple - normal - explanation people think X fail objective test X...did actually X.

I heard SOOOO many people Covid. many think got November-February, hundreds miles documented early cases travel around time 🙄   There's lot wishful thinking already get lives.

You’re wrong. Texas alone we’re 2,000 deaths per week. We’ll rise little week, continue level throughout August. 

Then add California, Southern states, Plains states, you’ve easily got 11,000 per week. Imagine 6,000,000 infected people roaming earth could infect? going right now. state, teaching salary $50k would mean pension around $15k-$18k year fully vested. half income pension fantasy. And? Wow. That’s ... new perspective. Excellent reminder take deep breath this. definitely conspiracy theorist. And, I'm definitely wary conflating causation correlation.

GCSD already pushed start date back Aug. 12, given option in-person learning late July decision provide virtual learning ""due current COVID-19 situation county rising numbers cases Gwinnett County,"" Roach explained.

Roach say newly identified positive cases changed district's reopening plans.

Orwell never simplistic writing. deduce Swedish model correct not. far anyone Sweden describe overall tactics deployed public? social distancing, mask wearing? pubs restraunts open? I'm distancing - yes nearly degree months ago.

Mask wearing - no, rare. actually required flights.

Pubs restaurants open, try customers sitting outside, atleast decent distance other. Especially true pubs. Clubs even close reopened, though. lmfao! good one. guess protests large gatherings lol. people fucking hilarious butt. 6th seriously wonder they're trying kill us guess that's take ... orphan teenagers .. people listen.

... Better headline: America Surrendered Coronavirus Funny preventable. wanted confirm Egyptian Egypt exist...and watching you:)

One assumes alien spacecrafts. see, [ancient astronaut theorists think people obese routinely die 40s? Many obese people live 70s 80s. underlying condition isn’t death sentence regular life, it’s risk factor “early deaths” 60s-70s.

It’s even death sentence COVID19, it’s risk factor dying weeks COVID19. Healthy people, athletes, children, etc. also dying COVID19.

What’s fucking point mentioning obese? difference make loved ones point now? Would say people otherwise healthy healthier wouldn’t died?

Disgusting. People dead, leaving son orphaned, something feel needs mentioning weight. Third guy right looks like Fauci... He's time traveler sent save us every major outbreak! ""Covid-infected persons"" instead ""Covid disease"", first line lol. terrible moderation  * Stay home symptoms, least two days symptoms all. 
* visit elder relatives elderly homes (exceptions made case case basis now)
* Public gatherings 50 allowed.
* Masks worn public (health care professions separate thing)
* ongoing social distancing, recommendations avoid congestions public transport, work home possible, etc. since March
* Pubs restaurants open restrictions - must distance separate tables, bar service allowed (so everyone must seated served get drink sit somewhere) checks places closed found placing tables close. outdoor indoor cases. (personal experience, bar went month ago, separate booths, even high wall booths every second one marked used)
* Stores businesses markings keeping distance queues avoid congestion. tea party pieces trash need exit government immediately. Thousands Americans died due denial science complete total lack leadership. remember, 50% people lower average IQ, average person pretty freaking dumb. Exactly. foreclosures happen, rents go UP. time there's foreclosures investors snap convert rentals massive demand. people's short-sighted, cruelly self-serving perspective validated point unlikely change mind. we'd real leadership beginning, locking whatever needed--doing what's good country whole--could seen patriotic duty. easily imagine alternate timeline Republicans wore masks like waved flags post-9/11. sound like ass you’re grossly underestimating gleeful stupidity Americans. here. town well regarded school district they’re opening schools weeks, people pouring put kids schools here. absolutely get it. might well gouvernment point all. already own. fucked touch everything is. Insane. I'm saying. It’s health illiteracy general science illiteracy. 

There’s folks, even post sub don’t understand scientific findings vetted published. 

That lack understanding means spread misinformation. question different either sarcastic purely curious. (there's lot people saying quarentine fascist take whatever reason). Look first person thread, look person replied to. asked first person question fascism (why think fascist before), masks. event curious question answered saying America fascist long time. used restaurants example justify question. I'm completely withen context. CDC estimates based bad data though. think 99% infections asymptomatic. analogy, would say Trump heat. keeps shit cooking. doctor couple weeks ago ran 20 miles mask O2 levels dropped 2%. 

Also, surgeons coal miners wearing masks multiple hours day years. I've taught Asia Western countries. I've seen kindergarteners walking school both. Japan China Taiwan always adult - mom, dad, grandparents, auntie, play groups, cram school - around kids. They're left alone hours day. There's big explosion huge plume smoke people running screaming. importantly, there's direct enemy causing it. There's one start war with. leadership's incompetence. 

If 11,000 people died week Muslim terrorists, would nonstop, round-the-clock, furious coverage calls warfare. People would screeching howling horrors all. We'd staring footage blast zones everywhere looked.

Whenever blame themselves, people rather comically dismissive. preventing situation requires kind personal responsibility admission fault, will, often not, minimize gravity situation much can. OK, can't read article available region, based title, absurd ridiculous.

260 tested positive exposed... 1 tested positive 259 met people infected (who could wearing masks well), 250 infected 10 exposed?

My point fear mongering headline, designed make numbers look worse are. would need combine number infected number exposed? Clarity arguments important sides. school set start tomorrow. teacher went home “cold” late last week confirmed positive Covid. school going cdc guidelines “close contact” means within 6 feet greater 15 minutes.

B-b-but people die heart attacks! A-a-a-and driving! guvment gonna take right drive away next! ... Americans, collectively, **still** listen medical experts scientists instead believe whatever crap undereducated big-mouthed person posts Facebook. get wrong--many people admirably following guidelines place others ignore advice wind hospital, fighting lives. Based mom hella fucking gay bro flew US move Germany never realized much cars destroyed beautiful land. reason AirBnB got huge amounts angel investment exact purpose. Idiots. deny covid patients low oxygen levels, hbot increases oxygen levels? sounds similar plum dipped perfume? like everywhere else herd resistance threshold kicks way sooner originally thought.

Same happened NY, Italy, UK, Sweden, Spain, FL, AZ, TX

Always rips month peaks incompetently handled places herd resistance achieved. Ahhh, seeing lake parties? birthday parties? outdoor areas packed people? Walmart busy day? Staff chin covers? 

Yes, Amesbury newburyport great. port speak. line dunks stupid. coworker dental assistant doesn’t bother wear proper PPE temperature taken office assistant “she’d rather catch wear mask higher level 3”. It’s bad work environment would able get unemployment refused go back allowed come back. want know gets away it....she’s boss’s favorite. needn’t complain nothing ever done past complaints things she’s done improperly done. Putting quitting two options. thought parents ones gave inheritance amount response lol told many times I’d rather parents money dead parents. They’re least wearing masks, it’s kind offer full protection others go way way do. Hopefully stay healthy! US data isn’t valid, test results take 3 weeks report. literally made distinction protestors rioters.

And still isn’t good enough. hate restaurants refuse wear masks understood meaning behind it. Tests shown handmade masks made tightly woven (dense thread-count) 100% cotton made minimum two layers gathered folds (like paper one pictured here) protect wearer 65% fits properly — is, without gaps sides — around you, probably even 65% 👍 working class neighborhood outer boroughs great right now! outdoor dining places packed, everything opening back up, street life back. It’s beautiful sight! haven’t Manhattan months it’s hard imagine ghost town given lively neighborhood is. Glad there. 300-320k.

Remindme! 12/31/2020 Yeah. Go tell COVID party. really know, think safe say France count Covid-19 deaths least. need laugh sometimes regardless ""side"" on. Humor good thing. Stop bringing US every single post lol Australia New Zealand. states. Looks like US gotten control. Glorious news! also misleading. counties highest storm risk also counties hardest hit Covid. look county report, see steady testing numbers counties, south Florida fraction normal testing numbers. clear, don’t necessarily think bad call. It’s better prepare early look like overreacted dealing hurricane. testing sites closed one day open weekends begin with. 

Take look Dade County county report see I’m talking about. *huge* dip cases tests today cone. Compare Hillsborough saw real change sites remained open. 

All say dip really highlights bad things Miami area right now. Things slowly improving there, it’s happening nearly fast enough. counties able see improvement much faster extent virus never bad Dade. lol extrapolate exponential growth curve, months we'll billion people dying every day. Lol hurricane + Texas didn’t report- nice try tho  That’s March dunce. Excess deaths important, reliable indicator *coronavirus* deaths. healthcare system overburdened, lot people die causes get timely help. submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Trump: MUST OPEN SCHOOLS state schools especially, combination drop $$$ international students big deal. So, here's hack.

I purchased kit 23 me. uploaded raw genetic file 23 requested account termination opted storing data. actually care 23 me. needed genetic file. 

I uploaded genetic file Promethase minutes comprehensive genetic breakdown every gene correlated with.

The entire thing costs $100 (23 + Promethase). 23 data took four weeks Promethase took minutes.

I recommend ever might encounter situation need private life insurance many genetic conditions that, flagged health care provider, would disqualify life insurance.

You'd get results back much sooner might screwed life insurance. you’re country one worst outbreaks, looking countries fewest outbreaks example.

Like Denmark, Norway Finland?

Meanwhile rising infection rates France Spain, heavily mandate mask usage. Time reopen everything. /s Finally, baby need place live survives layoffs. hand sanitizer made Mexico, you’re better throwing away. like word lol credit, easy decision. American work day basically completely dependent kids school day - parents working need watch kids somehow, also make sure kids actually getting school work done. here's look it: would rather deal stress, risk kid winding dead? death rate still less 2% last time checked, willingly putting kid school basically saying okay catching COVID Gut wrenching.... imagine... want to...


This exactly can't stand selfish people wear mask. far away Georgia governor allowed fucking overnight supposed week long YMCA camp happen. opened four days hundreds kids tested positive. Hundreds. three half days camp. Why? society? point evidence claim growth virus lower masked countries without? I'm trying debate, really know. look following countries masked booms cases, wonder idea masks=slow spread: 


Japan 
Hong Kong 
Spain 
France 


All countries mandated masks distancing yet experiencing surges cases. many factors think simple saying ""masks solution"" ""masks work"". answer women never gone workplace. Sadly no.

What happens instead businesses’ assets bought outright giant discount even smaller number ultra rich groups / families.

The oligarchy get worse. parents started leaving home alone around 10, never overnight sometimes they'd go day trip friends want go like 10 hours. play videogames even go downstairs answering door phone even issue lol 2011 got bad infection spiraled led septic shock/organ failure. healthy, 27, healthy weight non smoker/drinker. 

To day same. endurance never fully recovered. I’m mentally foggier used be. 

I push limits- running 10ks earned bachelors degree software development - feel difference hard things. 

This virus seems worse anything went really worry long term effects. Unfortunately lots info there, like CDC saying could “drive epidemic ground” wore face coverings 4-6 weeks. dangerous message. evidence work well, experts like Redfield say misleads lot people wrong place suit could $800 one week five $200 next needs die anyway Man, sad. seems like takes somebody personally horrendous situation like fully realize consequences safe times. One day we'll learn hopefully Good, suspend rest cruises  falling conspiracy theories. actually genuinely curious data came from. right, data affected. fucked US. virus evolving already, still people thinking even real! shocked well liked yet stupid enough sign waiver go Rally.

His intentions seem good retrospect see ended last round... read enough figure vote though Kill Mockingbird one worst books ever made! It’s even good everyone highly praises it. It’s written elderly boomers burned low quality. Upvote agree! K. That's parents it. hope minority. Hey now, Texas beautiful too. get away cities. people. appreciate grassland rockland, we've got spades. didn’t read huh? likely true reason Asian countries managed contain virus seemingly easily, may spread original less contagious Wuhan strain, due lockdowns travel bans recently infected Highly contagious D614G strain causing massive outbreaks USA/Europe/Latin America. Eventually places managed fend original may find measures insufficient prevent virulent strain. Um excuse sub allowed criticize horrible United States America, countries amazing. that's point exercise mis-informants. enough disinformation convince enough people information false. 

Sowing seed doubt... I’m sorry going talk something? literally one mentioning anything this? Explain. Easy say invested things made worth far less. Put others' shoes second.

And Magic fine could lot make things lot consistent average person lives regularly turned upside changes. quite detailed analysis, still going figures, thanks lot sharing! seemed highest paid far. least Presidents list knew good look take 25% pay cut. necessarily. thinking PS4 costs matter live - student loans. Cost living higher cost everything else stays same. Source govt saying masks dangerous? Sweden's strategy herd immunity suppression.

It’s easy mistake make, despite corrected literally hundreds time now, Sweden doesn’t never herd immunity strategy.

Are aware spreading misinformation rules subreddit? average age Sturgis attendees like 55+ sooooo yeah huge amount deaths related this. Pro sports teams. Don’t forget them...

Go on. Good thing America's health care system well equipped deal situation! No, virus extremely low death rate, little worse flu, so, worth risk.  Same. “People get shot say died Covid”  South Korea uses complete movement profiles looks credit card purchases contact trace. think find compatible lots countries laws. nobody cares anymore. Gotta open 'er pops n mom get applebees. percentages age group? tell read word wrote otherwise would asking question part right months prepare, also South Korea exploding epicenter disease explode Europe. France UK last major countries Europe make response. NATO members confident something know virus considering first known countries warned U.S?

These European countries asking Italy, France Spain notify notify European neighbors silent outbreak respective countries outbreak China happened. asking NATO members well considering warned U.S November. Plus witnessing outbreak East? 404 Italy found. Get better cloth mask plane. choose stay? motel seems safer bet hotel point. Keep ""Do Disturb"" sign times. point they'll probably ask least look room make sure trashed it. I'm absolutely furious physician, also feel quite trapped unable actually anything continuing educate patients friends. I've channeling fury keeping around safe, creative outlets, otherwise I'd screaming abyss daily. probably stole Oxford vaccine live low income suburb. people ridiculous, especially weird since fat smoke. NYC one unlivable cities US, surprise. Thanks! going go would definitely away people? shed backyard?? I'm sorry born lol Mmm nope pretty sure never said that? said response different post saying daycares closed since schools saying closed won’t it’s still something everyone able since it’s level education. would **isolate** get another test.

On hand, negative would, perhaps, give unwarranted confidence. particular majors always popular  think much education--if someone simply relying news government they'd receiving mixed messages throughout entire ordeal. Coupled inconsistency government leaders, heavily social culture valley recipe disaster. 

Our cultural upbringing option exercise. Gatherings stopped curfews, crowd limitations business closures could actually enforced via order real teeth bite.

Beaches, parks churches never allowed reopen did.

People encouraged travel, gather socialize--but unfortunately, government put place instead actual plan handle virus. confirm. Played video games (Destruction Derby Duke Nukem Gang) microwaved leftovers days home alone kid around 10.

At 18 using empty house smoke weed try get laid. Oh, also play Lobby scene Matrix dad’s massively overpowered entertainment system. Sweden herd immunity strategy, fyi, spreading misinformation sub rules  “While strain new Vietnam, seen Bangladesh, Britain, Ireland, according Vietnamese scientists.” Oh, worries all! know right way is, think swedish government assuming gen pop know use masks learn. know bad thing. 

Perhaps end better use masks improperly use masks ride monkey bars. schools SuperPACs, sure. don't. Maybe mask integrated white hood kind... Yeah get sick, going work compensate getting sick made right choice. wish best! wasn’t quite normal graduation. Everyone separated wore masks (my friend teaches taught student) 

""or least be.""

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone's uncle would disagree 1. 30% debt actually owed countries, debt owed countries.
2. dollar wind worthless, runaway inflation would happen, argued already going certain commodities american consumer goods, typically problem talk hyperinflation. inflation contained goods affect average person.
3. We've printed equivalent entire national debt past ten years inflation 24.3% since 2007.

Let's pretend know talking about. United States owed ridiculous amount money number different creditors literally decades. going legitimately become problem? obviously mattered point. CDC also recently said [schools fine even necessary would trust everything say days? fair, think that's good correction! Idk teachers going strike. Comparing Russian roulette league real stupid comparison. 

I’m comparing car accident that, covid. feel like outdoor sports could 25-50% capacity (depending size capabilities venue) IF, seats spaced other, masks ENFORCED concourse. 


Now actual players field locker room? might bit trickier. like Las Vegas walk street yard strawberry daiquiris $15 extra shot.  pessimist going happen 2020. going wait till January 2021 hopes Trump office. know Biden would do, better Trump done, essentially boils **NOTHING**. Hotel extended stay enter room. gonna wear surgical plane, guess I'll kn95 Could be. I've never looked enough get level detail sounds right. got 30 locked loaded starters role players. guys league 8 years easily. 23 backups, guys come give rest, etc. Many former starters themselves. probably leaves room less 10 guys good enough fringe players get roster spot good enough 53 year two. get fronted $150,000 come next seasons salary opt out. think safely stop lot this.

Surfaces shown major source transmission - impossible, large driver spread.

This getting spread large majority close person-to-person maskless contact, particularly indoors.

When started, washing hands much chapped two months straight.

Now, wash hands touching things outside world - putting groceries (which longer disinfect first), opening packages, etc. applied yet, would also wash hands running errands, though still getting pretty much everything delivered curbside pickup.

However, semi-frequently go ""drives nowhere"" get car drive around awhile, specifically wash hands now. wash hands run car something. hope goes truly needy greedy steal them. everyone starts packing back restaurants guys going fierce second wave.

""Outdoor"" key word seem missed. Shit, man I’m already afraid dying young. I’d hate something like shorten life span doesn’t kill me. I’d imagine things like heart/lung transplants going valuable. Also, need artificial hearts lungs advance quickly. Sadly isn’t much suffering brain damage. obituaries Wahhh bars closed. Boo fucking hoo. Yeah wear dorky matching vests gang written right it. needs break even least. problem that, demand, there's way break even. business profitable, ownership stakes worthless, employees better off. employees point view, best option work unprofitable business ownership stake in, way get pure reward owner takes loss. Assuming something cross reactive T-cells popping studies, agree lot review needed help us understand overall immune system response. work local schools quit yesterday. Basically still open even shut starters, 25% capacity filled. talked opening daycare school teachers staffs kids. schools close, run day care there!?! 
Also keeping doors unlocked opened. trained pack gunshot wounds went cpr training. training schools locked, imagine happen doors unlocked opened. list ridiculous things goes on. hate quit, would rather keep family safe. Agreed. 


I'm risk analyst trade, defended view COVID-19 BSwan. new buzzword apply without knowing criteria. 


Extremely low probability high impact. 


COVID-19 least medium probability... RN, Odell idea. Online school offered schools. students already plans graduating time. like school would drop out. could allow parents opt school without charging educational neglect. states could make kindergarten optional.  wife ordering wanna say Old Navy. They're basically thick cotton version pleated disposable ones, thick elastic Muh 401k!!+!!1 🖕🖕 US epidemiologists catch up, November 3. 

POS care point. cannot possibly stupid. large amount debt countries, want debt payed dollar worthless. stop citizens able afford imported goods dollar worth anything, collapse economy. accept reality want truly free. sooner adapt situation, faster end this. risk never going zero. CDC ones suggested social pods social bubble groups Brainwashing work disconnect prime directive long time. Three months already pushing circles. affects riots shown across decades. It’s quantifiable. 

Trying pretend Charlottesville equivalent riots referring New York places may help cling narrative. 

But not. Stores looted, sustained violence multiple days, cops shot even killed targeted attacks. 

“500 window damage”? Give fuc/ing break.

Sorry that’s reality truth. 

Take care. comment incorrect many levels. It’s party yes everyone outside. Food setup supposedly hosts replenishing food. sure bathroom won’t using either way, don’t plan eat drink there. Yup, likely close minimum wage grocer clerks. Goodness. Yep. I'm ""a free person free country I'm going listen lies government"" usually excuse men. Endowment state funds generally can't go sports. know details Texas make ton ticket sales huge TV contract games Aww sucks. used live Texas HEB one best grocery stores EVER!!

WEAR MASK PEOPLE!!! federal government country two entirely different things. federal debt affecting people live country, matter? I'll devils advocate. know didnt contract virus friends didnt? get tested aswell? majority cases asymptomatic unlikely atleast one it. agree outdoors reduce transmission unless got tested there's telling could've spread others. Oh too. see police shot multiple missiles protesters, threw back bare hands?! crazy  Maybe know sites owned run right-winged extremists? OK, saying went without masks one time they're somehow ""anti-mask?"" Damn wish air conditioning shut month. couldn’t doubt work Bike gangs wear colors Sturgis people attend gang. dunno, really worried covid protests support BLM. turned ok, point really know would beforehand. Whats interesting deaths New York City kept going total cases didn't. Almost like accurately reporting and/or testing. Hmmm. las Atlanta? see whole us, spike PERFECTLY aligns rise fall prevelance protests. 


Of course think people standing shoulder shoulder thousands hours every day night going spread virus already ignorant believe actual evidence. ""students unionize"" why? told go school doubly said play sports? much time commitment free leave team, cant afford stay school transfer state school. Lets stop acting like kids slaves system cannot leave. Nope. Well, fair, disease there's way directly hate blame brown people, China, appealing Americans without option form baked-in bigotry. Yeah it’s one, thank you!  You’re delusional all, first floor spaces historically high foot traffic. way less space 1200 Sq ft 40th floor high rise sixth floor walk comes territory, we’re adults. know sign contract body battered, compensation. Deep sea fisherman know people die sea every year, still go. Paramedics know may wrestle naked crackhead time time. Firemen, rescue divers, helicopter pilots, etc ad nauseam put lives line money. NFL different? realize difficult people Autism? I'm one them. 

I'm sure difficult whole lot people there. What's point? think we'd OK *most* things everyone wore mask. Sort works, actually. 

That ""if"" lot heavy lifting sentiment, however. work behavioral health clinic Texas. One therapists got COVID attending graduation party. went vacationing Las Vegas one month quarantine boss forced take. Oh could be. saw stand-alone r/wholesomememes really wanna understand happened US, listen episode 185 ""Masks"" podcast Smart.

TL;Dr - humans care tribal identifiers demonstrating in-group belonging facts, especially times crisis cross-group trust low. Unfortunately, mask-wearing became tribal identifier US.

Was inevitable become tribal identifier? solely point to, say, Donald Trump saying ""this new hoax,"" referring Democrats coronavirus, Feb 28 political rally South Carolina? Exactly. main point - [expressed excerpt toward - *perfect* - existing status quo *so* bad - even caught 50% people entered infectious window rapid daily testing, that's *way* better now, almost everyone gets results back late they're infectious window anyway. game changer could dramatically immediately drive R *and* make safe resume lots activities - take test go school / get plane / get haircut / whatever. Oh wait nevermind misread county. right mistake down-voted handle case data. Hospitalization data. Yes. IBEW l.u. 124, 25 years course did. guess deflecting kids dying surprise given treated school shootings like Tuesday. share collective embarrassment country, protests aren’t confined single state region. Alaska, too. One larger districts planning full-time, in-person, masks, Screaming Me-Me brigade still mad, district changing high school block schedule reduce number passing periods day (kids take number classes, classes day).

I’m sure Screamies want someone yell they’re really angry things aren’t normal. Join union. Yes, numbers made public. haven’t sorted everything yet, it’s like deal situation every day people place deal quickly, info public. news reports situations like Florida officials try lie. None true China.

The fact 1/3 country idiots beside point. Cases decreasing. think highs same. results come back two weeks, they're positive, able go back everyone met tell they're danger keep posting without evidence? Uhhhh... federal debt matters talking countries wealth...? You’re trolling right ? worker owned business doesn’t need profitable - that’s kinda point. Wages, administration, upkeep expenses along cost goods rent. everyone paid, output/sales/receipts stable, there’s float bank, doesn’t need surplus. 

The problem isn’t wants unprofitable business, it’s wants *start* one. seems purpose sub induce panic gaslight people perpetual negativity spiral rather factually inform people Covid19. Eggs. Basket. mean, we're also full blown recession, dude. Tons people unemployed right trying save money boost cash reserve. hard find second job make stuff sell one buying hiring much. Plus still find baby sitter hours work that's cheap all.

I hope offering child care services friends family, going list option took every individual representative government government lie blew proportion like this, may actually live civil functional society, let rest move on.

They effed bad. corrected, fact growing evidence, study study mask effectiveness, people choosing use them. easier blame institution discrediting rather taking personal accountability - people even looked countries (especially ones brought control), would see American government officials touting masks. international. point, I'm buying 'we trust government' rhetoric. people buy kinds garbage daily basis little evidence.  can’t find one outside paywall pretty damning piece Birx hew overly optimistic models pushed Fauci led second wave disaster. know price anything everything constantly sale original price changes depending sale %. I'm glad unethical practices phased bankruptcy. Thakfully school district going distance learning ""until safe"" return.. sure ever. 

I tell 1st grader crushed remainder kindergarten via school issued iPad March - June always pay attention 7 day moving averages. tend see people come subreddit Sat-Mon proclaiming decrease cases. realize Tue-Fri numbers spike. current wait time test response upwards week largest test providers country. Basically, point, one clue going cases. equally difficult determine deaths people dying without received positive test result equal length time. snarky you, thanks clarifying. (upvoted greater good). ELI5 - university *4 billion* dollar endowment asking donations?? choice go back not. go school county. county summer. would know lol Moderna obviously looked closer basically game changer vaccines think that’s gets much coverage 👍 nice day think every American afford go physician ask, ""so give lay masks""? use ""often"" hardly something claim presenting hard fact really specific claim, versus impression based personal experience... anecdotal evidence enough observation imho.

I making point person assume something specific story, lo behold turns case. trying present statistics matter, surprised something would think otherwise. get astral sex demon, asking friend. NYC saw massive protests drop cases. It’s almost like factors play town. That's going happen whether lock not. Maybe notice, consumers exactly shopping small businesses right now. would they, things delivered reduce exposure?

Getting virus control ultimately going help recover economy. We're going lock again... sooner start, sooner get recovery path. We’ll see things schools start though, make things go crazy. news report/recording Right middle = done enough piss ""fox news crowd"", done enough piss ""reality crowd"". Actually Brigham. killed jo Lest forget Harts. tragedy. US supposed 100 million doses upon Oxfords approval believe Oh look 3 months old questionable source. Ive scoured it, came short article like, two lines. Based post title, thought article would take defiant stance masks. better title agrees article would ""almost reasons exist wear Children 2, anyone unconscious incapacitated people trouble breathing wear face masks, according Centers Disease Control Prevention. medical experts say people probably public anyway. hospitalized worsened.   Link? Yes! cannot operate fear potential catastrophe. Millions kids schools daycares throughout world, including great many US. Teachers dying droves. Kids getting sick. minor increase risk justify shutting fundamental, essential function government. Sorry said “lots” felt safe using synonym. think reopening schools incredibly risky it’s safe assume adults become infected children. absolutely nothing thoughts reinfection though. Ps username call duty gamertag. way shape form support murdering fun lol fyi worst nightmare. poor kid. good things either way. think masks made big difference. early lockdown. reopened early weekend short heh.

Long road ahead still. Keep Another commenter said order doses hope they’re correct! looked briefly FB profile (it's linked article) profile pics appears adopted lease couple them. like tb0x said, 100 million doses well enough.  report Iran 30% getting again.  report widespread reinfection seen, seen analysis report. Tf worldometer? Almost 5 o'clock showing something like 25k new cases 300 deaths, wish numbers accurate know not, Mondays light reporting sure ????????????  ""We""? Oxford/the UK 100 million doses production, another 200 million produced following 6 months vaccine passes trials.

UK gets first dibs due funding production first 100 million. likely go US, expect mass vaccination via oxford unless many manufacturers get licensed make it. holy shit

the mental gymnastics required post something like this... BAck 80's upper middle class boomers started buying bikes roleplay Harley Riders gear heads loved working bikes. Type guys might lay tarp definitely would roll bike living room work on. like one. question. sons mother. boyfriend. son. myself. wicked sinus issues coughs. General fatigue....But nobody fever. concerned? Tested ? JFK theories absolutely blessed, thank service. Well CCP exist ten years now, sake chinese people, hope much sooner. sure thing care money would reacted necessary. 

Swedish people used joke said lot, (but avoid harming anyone's sensibilities, start warning pandemic, stopped funny). 

But goes something like this: ""no Swedish people friends"", ""that true, heard Swede friend..... died"". 

Sure metropolitan lifestyles Stockholm obviously parts Sweden like that. Swedish people also habitual joke giving certain region Sweden danish people, simply empty people feel like losing minds living there. Comparing lifestyle people states people living old world, linear may seem sometimes. 

And obviously governmental lies happening everywhere sorts different reasons. People may up-play degree masks make difference order get people even wear them, country (Denmark) up-playing success containing virus, order get back business. even report deaths unless within 30 days showing initial symptoms. Many people stopped caring official numbers here, authorities forced admit that. became clear everyone yet, government realised neighbouring countries come back business start taking better care, eventually caved peer pressure. 

The way chinese army beat death 20 Indian border guards death.. disgusting. honestly makes remember something Saddam Hussein said ""*I drag modern age even means killing half you*"". culture ... disgusting. love Thai culture chinese degree korean culture, horrendous, attitude people lower social standing ""I hammer, nail"" attitude age woman attractive stops attractive, borderline criminal. sooner forced develop, better. Idk, like guy there's pressure leftist Democrats turn things around.

Not hopeful, ""let's wait see"" me. course can't see bubble, stacks bodies high. see despair death front eyes right now. government willingly letting happen. sad ashamed live here. We've got get rid running country, rather running country, chaos! like living nightmare. man leaves office, hopefully virus go him! Think many lives stake schools reopening! Why? pushing people deaths! Oh that’s good know! articles read day said Moderna Pfizer going preferred USA. Thank sharing! *Everyone else nation:*

""Who?"" Looks like median Manhattan household income 109k. still 60% less person responded claimed. 

Mostly trying point absurdity saying “250k considered little average” tbh charged baseball bat empty stores homeless drive rent? Amazing. proud county get round ok. 

Long road ahead lots work still. charge would ""direct threat"" ""terroristic threat."" means intent kill, inflict fear someone may seriously injured, debilitated, killed threat valid. 

This intent someone using spraypainted toy gun. concept applies threatening coronavirus due horrifying results infection are, threatening infection *will* put asshole behind bars long victim presses charges.

Terrifying reminder even safe possible could still happen you. mom safe come, goes gloves/mask/hand sanitizer/lysol wipes, works, reading something like scary.

Even worse Florida going full steam ahead reopening schools even though we're hit hard. little brother distance learning, moms job bus monitor elementary/middle school kids, job literally around young kids. imagine taking masks off, coughing sneezing without covering mouths, coughing ""joke give corona virus."" I'm scared her, I'm scared 71 year old dad really starting slow general, I'm scared mom little brother immune issues. Yet theres literally nothing do, school starts go.  black market....or white market. It’s already happening several timelines including protests. 

USPS sabotaged hurt democratic elections. part norm.

Protesters still brutalized streets &amp; silenced media’s lack attention.

Covid-19 deaths skyrocketing end sight. COVID-19 slowly dropping news. 

Be fully prepared winter months Thanksgiving Christmas. That’s mainstream entertainment &amp; big corporations push. Regardless bad shit gets US.

You brag reading opposing view points. frequently refuse play ""source game"" rely dubious sources and, again, openly refuse consider even facially credible. something fit view settled upon long time ago dismiss hand. also make ""100%"" predictions that, course, turn wrong (my favorite said Minneapolis ""100% ... next covid hotspot US"", was, course, true slightest).

You literally celebrating ignorance. I'm talking textbook definition ignorant.

Now, go ahead, write little response claiming (falsely) even read this. But, favor, least clear one question - real reason want schools closed 6th grade home time play pokemen? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* I'm specifically talking people.

Of course agencies, NGOs, oligarchy support it.

But last time people said, ""I support starving children Yemen Israel asked us to.""

And think Yemen consent. think people aware, fully understand, etc. ongoing trials here. “We don’t understand [it] feel absolutely absurd,” said.

Without title description go off, bet 90% people could guess talking about. Exactly numbers game. Keep young kids home months, limit contact others, limit exposure Covid-19.

I’m absolutely appalled hear news young “healthy” person died virus, show picture someone 200 lbs overweight. I’m trying say healthy people don’t suffer virus, OBESITY HEALTHY. fat you’re healthy!!!

I used morbidly obese. 5’6 220 lbs, somehow “not big” American standards. couldn’t even walk stairs without winded! Add virus top that? I’d terrible condition!! 
Even normal cold flu would feel much intense big. Walking hallway school class would leave breathe. you’re obese it’s already harder breathe since you’re drowning lungs fat, basically.

I can’t even fathom people 300 pounds cope virus. 

Overall, think LOT American deaths could prevented people took health physical shape seriously. deaths could prevented obviously, I’m willing bet significant amount could been. majority released conditions, considered risk public serious flight risk held trial. would justify keeping someone, found guilty crime, jail? Basically, Asian, likely genotype ACE1 II therefore less likely serious coronavirus infection, even less likely get coronavirus. middle eastern, less likely genotype ACE1 II therefore likely infection worse outcome.

1 - Freedom movement:

Denmark closed society without restricting anyone’s freedom movement law. Instead public sector closed much possible, certain types businesses public gatherings closed (some required new legal framework), daycares, schools universities closed down, many people possible public private sector worked home. home go wherever whenever wanted. 


2 - government interfere authorities

- Sweden’s government forced authorities regions start mass testing advice health authorities. 
- Sweden’s government problem completely rejecting health authorities may year advised less restrictive drug policy. 

So clearly government lot within frames constitution really want to. 


3 - Municipal regional self government

In Denmark hospitals also responsibility regions elderly care responsibility municipalities. like Sweden. lot efforts happened close cooperation national local level. government, health authorities National Serum Institute coordinated effort supported local level knowledge infrastructure. working really well.

2010 Citizens United Yeah 30's sucked this. might 31-32 progressing lot shit wanted lmao silver lining plenty historical examples downplay hopes quick vaccine, we’ve also never effort like scenario like vaccine development. many ways precedent-setting. skepticism probably healthy, there’s reason assume bad news actually bad news. fact major vaccine candidates achieved status point encouraging. Religion requires logic. Oh, heard? Covid numbers longer properly released, C19 starting \*magically\* vanish! China making wet markets illegal enforcing would nice start. Yeah almost $2000 fun bed made. Eventually, comfortable laying it. would guess possibly. people get rid HIV. never vaccinated chicken pox several family members never it. Well lot competing vaccines, likely one work. Yes, whoever first profit, whoever make biggest number doses, might company. 

Also, considering it'll take months (years?) get distribution everyone earth, windows opportunity ""a new, better vaccine"" ""a powerful vaccine"" come later, too. saw Texas, Indiana. Illinois, Massachusetts recall. think purpose article government properly filter small-businesses spend bail individuals. Wow 😳 he’s positive finally ""new norm"" 9/11, Columbine, Chernobyl, Challenger, WWI, WWII, 1918 pandemic, Y2K, Hurricane Katrina, etc. Fuck ""new norm"". Fuck. Cheapest insurance find freelancer states around $350 month. cover shit, I'd pay $5k pocket insurance even gives penny. I'm dealing thing. parents, friends, family, acquaintances, neighbors... choices people around making baffling me. I'm trying can: social media awareness reaching friends, helping. 

Our culture socially driven think many find challenging break away that. good friend mine said went go visit family, asked why, said hard seeing parents. mind, kept asking, ""But infect them?"" know acting malice. hard see family, right now...it's wise. 

The thing right help around us much can. Human nature human nature. don’t know mentioned beside monumental loss life currently dealing with, subsequent mental health substance abuse issues going face nation going horrifying. Even virus eliminated today, ensuing social problems going staggering effects felt years. live area hit hard Katrina years it, including today, saw exponential growth substance abuse mental health issues. regional. We’re essentially dealing Katrina situation entire nation unfortunately doesn’t seem ending time soon. hope putting procedures place deal inevitable situation, judging current pandemic handled, highly doubt it. next pandemic. Oh fuck Fauci...he working Legion Doom Lex Luther take Gotham City blame Tony Stark...little know Quailmam even Silver Skeeter can’t save headline applicable every day. New record Mandates fines would likely enough bring us herd immunity threshold. anyone willing kill others vaccinated needs prison anyway. degree reckless hate amd stupidity toxic allowed remain matter time harm others different way.

Anyone threatena violence marked picked later time arnt prepared resist.  maybe die off, maskless? still naysayers? india going produce vaccines poor nations distribute it. dont worry! seeing Europe sure see spikes NY soon well. get information

We know much U.S. government gives damn anyone's privacy. Omegalul  Furries wear masks. know furry need look NSFW careful search quantity, yes. There's difference ""we working vaccine"" ""we've successfully distributed six billion people."" think shameful White House criticized Fauci simply he's job, he's incredibly knowledgeable. Oh, could go wrong. sub lose mind, first vaccines go lot people start returning normalcy. reality. subreddit. Quite opposite. many live state, long stayed hotel, flew drove, quarantined 14 days got home. Please explain would even work, technically, advantage would give government already locate us within half meter each, based phone carry around. data back claim? Surely protests factor we’d see spikes elsewhere? think that’s racism started you’re part problem. 

And I’m Americant thank Allah.

And it’s clear idea talking about. done here. Right. that’s got nothing people working right full-time $400 week people lost jobs make twice amount unemployment. 

I’m saying get $600 probably give money essential workers too.  unemployed would still way less spend rent food. still haunts trump said, 15 cases, would soon zero. article said testing people before. So, virus. miss? Ugh I’m gonna chug vitamin c whenever feel breeze Really? thought roughly amount. symptoms common flu vaccine I've watching live feeds, I've seen plenty discredit this. 

Beyond that, workers yelling every 10-20 feet wear mask means plenty people not. I've seen enough know that's true. Especially park PA system reminds periodically. I’m making 20% former income state UE. $600 make 60%. Wow really is, whatever reason protests caused huge spikes any. Hopefully good sign masks work protests help mold guidelines reopen properly.

Oh, yes, indoor church gatherings banned time being, proven virus loves indoor gatherings, specially there's AC. saying common sense, unfortunately poster saying also ""common sense,"" them. Right... cops murdered guy we're fired charged murder within week. Good job, American hero. virus killed black people 3 months 20 years cops go ""ally"" die. common clay American West. Y'know. Morons. Ok. That's grim wondering media get numbers isn’t guy posting numbers send info media That's emotionally persuasive ""guilt trip"" style way try persuade people analyze actual facts situation. reminds way entire outbreak reported on. little fact, lot emotional outrage based reporting. Take largest number (150k) exclude information number acquired (leave undiagnosed percentages, deaths ""with"" VS from, co-morbidities, qualifies etc) paint picture humanizing number. creates angry scared people nothing actually inform going precautions take life. Hence ""doomsday"" style reaction. 

A media opposite agenda could easily shrug say 150k 0.04% population make number look small. small fraction percent. would devious though still accomplish anything helpful. 

This good idea focus apt comparisons facts assessing actions taken large scale situation could affect millions people various ways. yes, people dying COVID19, yes absolutely take precaution. important though take precautions based apt comparisons detailed risk VS reward analysis. 

One example needs heavily analyzed long things stay shut down. shut everything indefinitely many families end unemployed, potentially homeless, etc. long term costs 30 million plus unemployed? That's potential long term devastating crash could kill hundreds thousands time, cause massive crime, generation long poverty, huge amounts inflation government bailouts stimulus rapidly speed collapse. people understand collapse like works, they're blind one media talking sell headlines like big death total. certainly kill far though long term, sensational fashion. 

This country needs real informed conversations things go long term stop playing politics crisis. media needs inform people responsibly stop trying scare big numbers. nothing help people creates panic. Good decisions made panic mode. Look... LOVE Disney World. used work there, I'd play parks every day oftentimes work too. Pixie dust runs goddamn veins. life I've literally reoccurring dreams trying get there, (from childhood day. never ends, swear god). 

But GOING PARKS RIGHT STUPID. magic death disease. amount pixie dust wishing stars gonna guarantee safety, okay? Wait vaccine proven WORK, everyone's gotten actually safe go. 

I get Disney World place people go get away stress reality every day life. preset adventure blissful place happiness making wonderful memories key. right gonna you. Instead, escape sadness stress could literally lead end life. happy place cast members be. risk lives almost EVERY DAY keep running. 

You wait magic little longer. It'll pandemic. Pixie dust promise.  Yep. wait patiently know coming. much harder without end sight. We're going keep distancing wow, presence reasonably effective vaccine would sure help emotional state. think people view hoax idiots see viewpoint protests. disagreeing protests hard take media seriously weekend before(memorial weekend) CNN keep playing shots going people beach literally five days later barely mentioning pandemic risks protests. Worse saw CNN reporter cover dc protest mask height hours later streets completly empty wearing mask.

Unfortunately inevitable cases eventually rise things open people get shutdown fatigue. try limit exposure wear mask practice common sense. Oof. third world country, Canada shit together. comment pretty silly. take solid correction misunderstanding shoehorn ridiculous victim complex it. claim numbers finalized comment replying arguing that. comment replying lampooning people claim hoax. Coronavirus definitely hoax, I'm sure agree seeing espouse mask wearing caution.

You easily correlate social distancing compliance/mask wearing rate spread. nullifies point deadly disease is, still people dying/getting permanent physical disabilities/having pay enormous hospital fees/gumming system be, since nontrivial amount people America believe serious fake. run MS german company, ""expedition"" cruises hard get places insanely expensive - think 3 weeks antarctica £35,000 per person seems significantly interesting. Interesting question - anyone really want piss mailman (put work)? sort reputation “going postal” It’s amazing far US fallen great-great-grandfather physician died 1918 pandemic. physician mothers side family me, I’m taking care COVID patients internal medicine resident. time alive.

Today quote; “I want saying real concern I'm saying higher chance dying common flu I'm sick media treating like black plague”

Yes flu hit MAX 49k year since 1970’s, hit 150k since March. Pretty much thing dad. I’m done. can’t tell joking not. understand desire single persons response next useless probably would harm good Whether ignorance malice know. know regardless, rushing market, esp disease incredibly deadly nonetheless, bad frankly unethical idea. Graduated '09 business degree. phone, told bother coming interview Sears qualified (Electronics department sales). I've watched several since opened. Every feed see handful wearing masks properly all. even feed week shi walked two staff members chatting garbage shields masks removed. Boy move fast remask person walked towards them. 

What noticed camera takes sharp turn away person gets closer.  bankrupts postal service? is, according CDC. BMI 30 higher, considered underlying condition. remember another redditor telling BMI number underlying condition another country lower. 25, place starting get little crowded became pussies It’s main weapon use covid deniers. suppose could say almost 200k excess deaths fabricated don’t really see that’s possible. 

The really telling thing 200k extra deaths average time lot people working home working means less traffic workplace accidents. 

Also lot people following quarantine, mask, distance good infectious disease practices would cut way infectious diseases like flu, read one lowest flu seasons many years this. 

And still 200k deaths average. would lead believe lot deaths covid 200k. Yeah. 9 confirmed cases China group infected via central AC hotel China. virus woke spread protests. know that's narrative spun early would impossible seen results yet... even contract tracers specifically instructed ask protests. notice. may [Bypass browser plugin. 500 today, largely because:

Pretty much every day last week 1,000, going get worse. New cases stabilized--not gotten lower, basically stayed same. Wow holy shit masks oh fucking scary. controlling whole time?!? sick twisted irrational logic convinced them...to uhh...put damn masks safety lol sadly fall deaf ears. South Korea cheat code.. Everyone ignored it... GG Hah get it! Cuz exist anymore! Funny republicans pretending concerned children miss months person school set behind. Meanwhile don’t give shit children die. front lines. PPE, states guard ppe supplies national guard troops prevent federal government stealing it.

We testing, lockdown contract tracing.

We saying goodbye friends relatives go ventilator.

We warning, got parents safe ordering food supplies online keep inside. too.

I'm sorry loss. friend deserves go home hero. Look Trump's best friend again. Hopefully realizes educated Americans behind him. Greatest country world! Fire fax machines! Question, n=10,000 mean? see academia I’ve never able figure work !!! Come Oxford leading learning institution won’t disappoint incompetent, would imply know doing. 
They know doing. Everyone already bleeds rectally thought? Also keep mind states likely 20% plus infected led level immunity. people immune slower spreads due less people spread too. part reason NYC slowed much. Alabama Mississippi two illiterate states country?  got results back next day NY beginning June. Feels good competent Governor. Pretty sure flu covered help support war effort, even worse today cruise companies think bad luck. Oh gosh.

I wish Americans started take responsibility rather continuously pointing finger Russia/China/WHO/etc. first step actually get shit together.

Don't tell Putin responsible stupidity. one you. figure federal problem federal guidance, resources, support. What's deal kpop? find people? probably voted Trump. no, doesn't. wants cash hand. determined Amazon gets broken trust. less 1% children die, child/ren number many.

This shit dealing US, politicians caring wanting score points.

Gonna lot dead children, parents co-workers parents.

NYC 10% death rate among infected hospitals overrun. 10% US 30M...... could reason due covid19. countries shit almost back normal. Americans petulant children, country can't open registered matter That's system in, able compete without corporate funding since opponents using it. point really make sense. link:

""After restricting analysis studies “explicitly reporting current smoking,” researchers said association smoking disease severity longer statistically significant.""


So make title bit misleading? Especially since quarantine period. Many doctors believe stay current course, could record low year flu many wearing masks, distancing, washing hands. that’s something. people randomly generated NPCs intended make simulation appear real. NPC easy spot, instance, continuously run wall, squat one place, board cruise ships pandemic. That’s district. Teachers told would notified student came contact Covid. school said responsibility report health department. Sounds like going case everywhere try minimize disruption. Ugh. Yes, account taking loans invest in. would situational dependant. vaccine ever released public use less 5 years. using traditional methods vaccination live/dead virus injections. Almost vaccines human test stages different techniques, none ever approved human use now. 

So completely new techniques + rushed trails. Good luck anyone accepting it. think depends tested. child spent couple days hospital covid test done hospital lab, results right away. understand, people outside hospital place dedicated lab, test sent lab, many swamped tests top normal work. Feels like, ""hold bag meth.""

Already dissolved vodka.

And neighbors arrived case four loko... fear-mongering. likely vaccine future, also heading part year kids spreading lots families much quickly rest year. 2% death rate likely also higher actual death rate, learning better ways treat patients. However, see overrun hospitals, like New York experienced, may tough 6 months. think best acknowledge risks, plan accordingly. Trying scare people part reason good half country believe big deal. Found virtue signaler god wants time

If heaven much better people waiting never point acceptable ask test subjects expose deadly virus ""for science"". Put covid deaths perspective FFS.

Flu pneumonia deaths combined per year 16 30 per million, COVID-19 deaths 558 per million Well actively implement policies ban policies stop spread instead encourage it, get. live hour east atlanta. terrifying here. incorrect. evidence outside badly done studies suggest untested cases even 2X numbers let alone 20X.

Specualting total fatality rate peole tested also pointless exercise gives us nothing value. ""fundamental stuff"" call leads wrong conclusions. really. I'm done talking doomerism. Goodbye. 9-11 turned world upside hunting terrorists. one 9-11 every 3-4 days. One think efforts get control would magnitudes larger back then. Maybe much money pandemics fighting war business? There's many tests US give results almost immediately. cost like $20 hear. Never gotten know many have. March remember hearing projection 1 million US deaths. media gaslights every month. quarantine law S. Korea grants health authorities access surveillance data public/private sectors without search warrants emergency. law prioritizes public health privacy, constitutional according Constitution Republic Korea. vast majority Koreans eagerly support it.

There controversy publicizing past route diagnosed patient anonymizes every info related personal identity. QR registration widely accepted days, many cases places patient visited disclosed public health authority figure 100% visitors overlapped patient. Yeah - it’s pure madness! July terrible terms new cases and...why open schools??? point intentions clear day take however want keep family safe think people putting upmost effort stop going disappointed end result dude... video 4 years old...

What shame. people die preventable unnecessary condition. They’ve cooked another argument scream people week. 

It’s currently “THESE 7 AIRBORNE VIRUSES MUCH DEADLY COVID - WEARING MASK HIDING INSIDE THOSE?”

Once that’s longer feasible they’ll forget break new talking point scream people’s faces. never change ways someone love (if they’re even capable thing) strapped ventilator. Ah course, online poll one gives shit gives random answers. Wow thanks useless info. 'They starr deal': Canada looks horror USA Covid-19 crisis rEsPeCt vEtErAnS coronavirus hoax.

This actually worse, people can't good conscience quit jobs sign war zones hospitals turned Japan here.

Have beer walk home. It’s extra refreshing way.

Also Sakura season park. Great picnics(adult kind) nature! enough time spread around one. Well done fuckwits. Wowwwww could known?!? So... actually works, though. Sharp rises cases means sharp rises deaths weeks later. We're seeing cases peak country right now, means deaths peaking coming weeks.

Cases going right now, deaths increasing.

Won't matter month schools start again, though. Ahhh thanks Nobody cares anecdotal singular experience could also completely made up. state complete total dump nothing leech states along others region. every objective measure, state people overall complete total failure. country favor self-eradicating along virus. disgust me. Mental patients rarely admit mental patients anyway, appeal autonomy pointless discussion.

People exibit signs mental illness get classified mentally ill. try help fix thier mental health instead encouraging disease. know tons people different backgrounds educations little hesitant take whatever vaccine comes right away.

Ignorant people come shapes dick falls go blind like 2 years.

Yeah get vaccine get pancaked falling piano way doctor’s office?!

Go research isn’t YouTube videos vaccines ‘cause sound exactly like antivaxxer. ship good luck finding port let in.  Yeah I’m guessing Tucker Carlson something FN talking head recently made claim average age killed 9/11 34 years old. average age dying COVID 87. saying old people dying acceptable it’s likely explanation doesn’t people shaking boots. Kids good 2 things. I’ve noticed too, might COVID — think medical issues people putting catching them. official COVID numbers flat declining NYC. are! tv pieces local NBC Fox affiliates Fuck man sucks, poor guy, hope gets this.

I would've awfully confused constant sirens could hear mid March May, that's sure.

They died none us known though. Yup...was worst ""flu"" life two nights vaccine...actually first second vaccie. Woke soaked, get bed due chills. Went away next day. I'm interested getting takeout food see many restaurant workers wearing masks wearing masks properly eat food home instead. Medical totalitarism. It’s fact. 
Open eyes, learn history.
It first time powers hijacked. yet, yesterday, analysis Mexican patients found:

“Age, male gender, diabetes, obesity one comorbidities independently associated laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Current smokers 23% less likely diagnosed COVID-19 compared taking 9 days?

There clinic road providing drive testing get answer fifteen minutes. Math:

720 deaths day.

5040 deaths week.

22,320 deaths August.

Are cool numbers ""leaders,"" looks like failure me. Education extremely stable face economic downturns. Consider planning grad school economic downturns worse '08 recession far probably going get worse. running around country, told it'd quarantine me. ignores people go work Interacting people. I'm sure it'll matter.

This country Sandy Hook happened, jack shit. Irrelevant anyway. Overall mortality higher 2019-2020 usual, point. wanted officially counted. serious? I'm old. wait people living ( bartender) sure change. I've never disliked fellow man saw racists come woodwork administration. I'm black white look things bit differently still feel deeply human experience. alive tragedy matter it. outage 9/11? true equality looks like. virus doesn’t care race, income, sexuality, religion, marital status, education, criminal background... Sure POC first wave casualties next wave going white Christians *always* everyone else. know? I’m one them. Many Americans feeling true equality first time miserable lives. Even vaccines think would kind social distancing. time everyone gets shot it'll probably end 2021 left-wing much better. listening Rachel Maddow say “It take nearly month move Navy’s hospital shops New York. bet it.”

Did also say ships exist, Navy hoax sea dangerous puddle? didn't, same. And? know 11000 week final peak? could easily rise higher numbers due overwhelmed health system lack hospital icu beds, outcome severe illnesses could worsen too. percent american population infected yet death-rate risen significantly. Dumbasses. Dumbasses pandemic defeated America. Would like see studio prices study well Military protect freedom bombing people control access oil.

The people defend freedoms ones home fight ensure everyone rights freedoms supposed have.

I'm ex-military, nothing ever service defend America anything. doubt, there's tons greed corruption. can't pretend hard-working normal people invest well also become millionaires - happens everyday.

I think probably requires deep love money take risks put hours lead new wealth. Well whole world believes China 88,000 cases so..... seem People understand death ventilator looks like. Hospitals start asking patients sign media releases nightly news show images really happening patients decline. I'm saying watch people die television, able show environments look like reality might help people understand. mail employees I've seen wear masks could explanation. I'd also like buttons filter non US posts. What’s point though? often try digest number people dying heart disease cancer even flu? That’s life. Nearly 3 million people die US every year. need significant change number people get really upset.  Unlike, example, school kids. \s case misinformation subjective. We're looking statistics drawing different conclusions.  Turns coronavirus brain cells good chunk Americans do. said 60% US would infected Covid? stop trying ""predict"" future. literally never close right, sow chaos. Even unpredicted spike we're even close path. Literally fear mongering. virus serious, need take every precaution halt it, shit stupid. Phase 3 trials efficacy *and* determine safety across large population longer period time. definition safety cannot assessed scale scope phase 1 2 trials. 'The UK bad response'

The key word 'had', situation UK far better now.

'I trust government report stats correctly.'

We definitely trust ONS however, compiling statistics go one best organisations world largely independent government.

'Just look Financial times excess deaths UK, 65k total. see analysis excess deaths ONS figure England Wales 58k excess deaths due peak. around 51k mentioned coronavirus death correct excess mortality higher officially reported statistics. figure anywhere close 20k (even adding Scotland Northern Ireland) unexplained excess deaths however. ONS released detailed analysis unexplained excess deaths found here: discreptancy PHE's death figure ONS death figure 8k. Largely due PHE figures rubbish review.

The PHE figures missed 10k peak epidemic overstating deaths 50% ONS, ignore PHE figures look ONS figures I've said.

If want look ONS figures put UK (rather England Wales) death toll 56319, last week. T-cell response recovered patients SARS still robust, quite surprising ever watch PBS newshour. mandated every American allowed internet watching cable tv sickens almost much many people dying - feeling like I'm becoming desensitized 5-digit numbers. dive in, I'll note mostly agree this. Let's forget get carried away making fine points back forth. 
&amp;nbsp; 
Yes, would catastrophic several thousand people 22 locations showed in-person, close-quarters worship every day three straight weeks. 
But fact small percentage membership participate person. There's ""hopefully"" it. 
This church, like nearly churches area, offering online services members minimize interpersonal contact pandemic. 
I also suspect that, like many churches area, church implementing distancing protocols people participate person. 
I know specifics protocols. suspect did, would judge perhaps full good intent, ultimately falling short entirely effective, combination up-to-date understanding virus spreads, reasonable plan sufficient enforcement, coherent vision adjudicate disputes. CDC say 11,000 deaths week month August, 33,000 next 20 days? Yeah, site turned straight garbage. many old, crotchety dudes. 

Last saw, shut down. I’m even sad. went swarm gravitating lately. Nah say **WOULDN'T** work. issue right is, COULD work, need scientific evidence show that. That's running tests drug first place.

Long story short researcher extremely confident vaccine work ready months. used 3 21 year old triplets trial sure safe well. haha ha but

seriously look virus mutating Maybe likes sound like fatty Yes, expect everyone isn’t forced work staying home. Yes, months. It’s I’ve would lot fewer months everyone fucking it. get sun without patronizing business endangering workers. see friend FaceTime. mental health currently mostly impacted family one still adhering correct position sheltering place much country tries pretend covid isn’t dangerous is. Living like pandemic entitled garbage literally costs lives. might exactly getting virus, yet handle it. US country see people wearing mask, actively forcing people wear mask.

so much country freedom. beat virus without vaccine, period. halt temporarily, always going waiting.  say ""/s"", know lots people thinking could get two day cruise maybe get two weeks free. looked bc curious exact beliefs like oh gosh. right beliefs?:

Sex demons give women disorders vagina threw dream sex. folks describing vaccine shots uncomfortable never encephalitis vaccine. worked fort detrick army got tons vaccines odd stuff vaccine VEE (Venezuelan equine encephalitis) whole level shitty. live attenuated vaccine brain ailment virus gives recipients like two days migraine headaches, sensitivity light, nausea, super shitty side effects. Back got shot worked next day severe pain. years later gave people 2 days get shot order work disease.

I would still take side effects though highly effective covid shot. Sounds like vaccines trial pretty normal vaccine side effects though. That’s good. statement pretty nonsensical actually agree overall idea. looking numbers like this, don’t see don’t start shipping vaccines reached Phase 3. know reasonably safe, side effects surely outweighed pandemic ravaging country.

Yes. is. horse high cut legs get it. seriously looking developing coronavirus vaccine since 2012.

And vaccine coronavirus. effective vaccine Covid 19 take it. anyone government fool people believing ""Operation Warp Speed"" realistic 8 years vaccine common cold found. flu Covid 19 arent even phylum, nevermind family. obvious common cold Covid 19 different even family common cold vaccine protect Covid 19 random redditor doesn’t accurately represent Swedish health authorities? time wars actually broke too. that’s I’m talking about: people aren’t taking seriously. nothing 100% effective stopping spread coronavirus, least that’s used regular people. exponential spread still occur. Crowds front Francesca's last night. without masks. Cant wait see Marshall street week. recommend asking people coughing spit inside mouth remove doubt whether not. mind ease Sorting *controversial* hour gonna quite ride Senate yet another vacation. They've taken fucking weeks vacation 7th, get rest month off.  Ya know, implication... Wow Welp UI $53/month, even cover half rent already pretty low comparatively $600/month. Debating whether call landlord tomorrow move car job hunting, wish knew one way happen this. people UI state lost 70% income, 92%. Closed reason too. tropical storm fart wind. amount enhanced unemployment part impasse right now. Republicans also want make impossible people sue businesses who’s failure take/enforce necessary precautions lead getting sick, they’re including money needed states balance budgets due decreased tax revenue increased expenses due virus. 

I expect total amount enhanced unemployment eventually reach compromise figure Democrat Republican plans, issues may take longer work out. lot less people back then, bigger % people died back young people died lot more. Read again.

You've wrong many points point becoming waste time correct you. throwing whatever there. hope people reading thread read study come right Especially US denying credible fear interviews South American refugees trying hold Mexico. Exactly say behind closed doors...  They're already back expected quarantine 14 days. way hell trust students so. expect Syracuse see rise cases sept 12th. Apparently, there's least small group idiots born every year. terms personality presentation? No.
In terms total incompetence? Pretty close tie. *trillions (well, total) Same, I'm always sore couple days flu shot, headachy feel crummy, every time. “If you’re talking throwing arms around other, sitting 67,000 people Philadelphia Eagles game, I’d imagine would take couple years,” Offit said.

I'm gonna call bullshit one. way people put kinds restrictions years vaccine comes out. reach certain level immunity get vastly better treatments, COVID viewed another illness; much like seasonal influenza Well yeah, social media driving force. I’m it. :-) haha troll worthy post here. hurricane didn’t warrant closing anything either. back running test centers tomorrow. I. flex hand enough, even without strap around elbow, produce visible veins arms. could donate blood loved seeing made much easier. Shame make easier use damn fingertip clipper thing (limited) experience, skill set needed. company wants pay less it. lay divvy responsibilities among colleagues without increasing compensation. effectively increases employee output without increasing wages. Rinse, repeat.

Is wrong? necessarily. literal function business make money. would argue colleagues could pick responsibilities, needed.

How describe system common place exploit depend wealth? Even better, describe society required part system receive affordable healthcare? may wrong, sure hell right. pretty much would. vaccinate high risk individuals health care workers teachers actual pandemic over. honestly don’t know long takes that, know people sub want pandemic last forever urgency world right don’t know could 2-3 months get vaccine people mentioned

Edit: guess pandemic late November means anything Yep, issue time, right? Denmark (and Sweden) cannot really allow citizens leave country. ask quarantine after. 

Sweden close borders Nordic countries honestly, media coverage got feeling quite surprised Nordics closed borders time (and later started opening EXCEPT Sweden surprised offended somehow). countries seems relationship government citizens based individual responsibility everyone takes actions. something home country would fly even day.  matter much tested 4 5 months had, data longer term effects. Yep. I’m anti-vaxxer either, don’t believe “Bill Gates going microchip us” conspiracies. It’s clearly rushed though. There’s reason takes around 10 years develop vaccine. it’s released soon without proper experimental phase, anyone certain won’t detrimental long-term side effects? I’d rather take chance virus that’s personal decision make. makes sense. I’m sure wouldn’t able detect antibodies every single virus we’ve encountered? dunno, viruses weird. Good news! voted down, think still point. Japan today example masks alone silver bullet. country extremely widespread mask use, 2nd wave still happened.

Just misunderstandings, saying masks useless. Masks powerful. also need methods. seems masks alone strong enough. wonder trump would respond question “when last time wrong?” 🤣 great news. Let’s see mid long term side effects are. I’d hope isn’t any, knows. Russian roulette straightforward. 


Oh wait: *Russian* roulette. Lol. Wasn’t trying win argument. Quoting tom hardy inception... good work though. Yeah, difference typical injection pain something like tetanus shot feels like someone hit hammer. needs quantified better  can't even imagine that. Given total dumpster fire world is, kid free stay long want. Yes Trump. Either agrees youre fired. shit, different century. aid recovery ? really bad flu years ago, like half hair fell 3 months later, I’m talking chunks hair brushes full, falling month. went dr totally alarmed like oh sick all? like well flu dr told high fever number days cause hair fall 2-3 months later...it long 2 years look like balding women. sucked mad April fact healthcare workers given N95 better masks, proves fucked everything is. irk everytime see medical professional wearing lousy surgical mask inside Covid-19 emergency center. Check kind endemic among cult leaders. deaths trail. Remember hyperventilating losers moms basement getting tizzy cases trended US. 

Guess doesn’t apply lot Europe seeing upticks Australia, japan etc. forget rich well connected. like testing premium access vaccine comes out. Per capita, Spain's numbers last days equivalent 20K+ US. Good luck indeed. came state North Carolina last year wanted build second Noah’s Ark. 

Hate break Creation Museum already beat it.  Jesus around today, he'd denounce people stupid motherfuckers. Still people wearing masks wrong back though. One dude chin good Exactly sentiments lol Back work bonuses ridiculous. Republicans trying paint unemployed lazy trying divide working class ""essential"" (aka disposable) workers would get screwed again.

That money go people making shit wages forced work whole time.

Sincerely, someone would benefit ""back work"" bonus who'll give money coworkers who've work whole time. Get real. Animals ate. Anything. name it. Cannibalism strawman. Got anymore dipshit? thats correct. property city taxes. doesn’t mean found “all deaths caused coronavirus”. 

All means found more. way! shut entire school right away idea else could gotten infected. cases younger individuals result zero symptoms it’s incredibly hard track unless force every kid, every day, take test. Otherwise one kid spends 8 hours school know till next day could infected hundreds thousands students 1 day. high school attended years ago short 4,000 kids one building. 

It's already happened believe Indiana, school running 24 hours first case found shut down. Kool aid shortage something? That's one heck deathcult they're organizing. aren’t skimping safety efficacy trials. One “advantage” may accelerating trial covid-19 widespread even weeks control group getting statistically significant rate, especially pick hotspots correctly. Meaning apparent whether vaccine works without challenge trials (injecting people disease, unethical I’m sure they’d to)

The 2 reasons could understand fearing vaccine are:
1.	There phase safety data comes question (unlikely one NIH knows Trump ), or;
2.	You’re worried long term side effects obviously can’t know sure (but long term effects virus even asymptomatic people looking really bad, I’d bet vaccine better) wear mask there, guys lots Testosterone, can't get that, also need skin head tattoos help also, also make scooter louder helps fight virus well. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* honestly even bother research drugs obtain approval? vaccine zero efficacy level phase III trials, earth would FDA approve release? actual real scenario could exist vaccine 70% efficacy get CV19 get sick resuming normal behavior. Dr. Fauci postulated normal probably far away. literally see reason could bad thing, people subreddit seem upset it. confused. studies damage lasted long 60-90 days recovery. studies showing goes away, knowledge. word ""may"" phrase ""may permanent"" modifier means ""it's possible."" international travel Federal issue. hope people choose travel internationally voluntarily quarantine. mom believes virus genetically engineered lab China *specifically* ruin Trump's chance reelected actually built-in kill switch/""timer"" deactivate virus election Christmas ensuring deal anymore. 

So hang kids, come mid-November we'll partying like 2019 again. way tell people charge... Ah, well that’s slightly better rush ""open economy"" hurt things wanted keep open.

This going change nature entertainment industry long time. planned asked transition permanent drop revenue.

Instead waited cases dropped little sounded clear. know get eye hurricane means safe take storm shutters off. Seeing words like edging. second get headline like ""Oxford Vaccine Deployed Within 2 Weeks General Public"", I'll cooming days. Correct seem suggest COVID survived, odds reinfections worse almost nonexistent. Especially healthcare workers everyone needs. admin addressed it? admin kind dancing around policies plan *when* teachers get sick. didnt happen Dogs bred domesticated companions thousands years. livestock solely food. mention illegal India (and countries mind you).

The US Congress really needs pass sort assistance program directly subsidizes employers wages employees.


Like not, judging way outbreak handled, thr US going much deadlier time nations, especially vaccine gets delayed. typo? Please let typo... stupid inundating airwaves bad flu. CBS fake news sure, opening schools safe. fine. /s


Holy effin shit, wait month school starts. Shit going get much worse. heart breaks thinking it. 

I can't believe real life anymore... Damn. surely better mentally physically half family dead virus.... They’re pro life long fetus sin free potential future republican. illusion shattered reality stop giving shit. feel you. Hawaii pushed back start date school 2 weeks staff supposed report school time prep. 100 adults mulling around, poorly social distancing. much anxiety work network admin, it’s job really used love. 

My wife pregnant home, I’m expected person break/fix full classrooms. Fuck. fuck. I've always wanted dress Spooky Submariner Scooby Doo, might well embrace moment. look many Americans get infected die, idiot moron US™ pandemic control.

So US become stupid, fucking great!  people...unless super rich. One death tragedy, million deaths statistic.

We threw hands up, screamed Economy, opened up. GDP blew past great depression era numbers anyway don’t know long term effects someone seems fine recently it, doesn’t mean actually future. 

I agree high risk individuals high exposure individuals get first attitude shouldn’t be, oh young people healthy people don’t need all. 156000000, that's many would die, that's average. ok 1.4% dying family right? Sure enough 2016. never *sighed* much one day. 2019 before: government shuts congress doesn’t want increase debt ceiling. 

2020: debt ceiling? Death seems like it'd give finality get generator. I'm surprised well local pub extended power outages last year (California). wait. Let hospitals overrun October. emergencies turned away full parking lots shake us, nothing will.

Republicans claim media fear mongering. honestly think media held back. still think they're holding back panic public keep markets trading.

Anyway, WTF videos coming Wuhan people seizures, turning stone dying streets? Wuhan lock people inside? hospitals overrun? There's disconnect me. I've following obsessively since January. virus mutate something less deadly? genuine question. 

There rumor back March Goo, Twi, Fac snuffing videos. Burying anything avoid panic, keeping real footage civilians going viral. Either true or-

C. one hell psy-op videos people dying streets.

I'm sure think I'm avoid mess. horrors dead reporters people boarded houses different idiocy got USA. So, exactly.

To draw data cited, cumulative mortality influenza influenza-like illnesses 69,9/100,000 57-58. furthermore, likely broadly scoped cause death complicating objective gauging influenza’s true impact mortality confusion influenza influenza-like illnesses (ILI). Influenza one scores respiratory viruses bacteria cause ILI. Without laboratory testing, influenza infection clinically indistinguishable Official annual respiratory viral surveillance data seasons 1976–1977 1998–1999 shown mean 12% “influenza specimens” actually tested positive influenza 1999 2001, positive confirmation influenza virus fewer 10% deaths recorded caused influenza. Although proportion increased recent years (14% 2002, 23% 2003, 18% 2004), absence testing, cause death still speculative. 

Mortality among **confirmed** COVID cases 45/100,000 US right now. Now, think we're factor 10 like old influenza numbers tested/overall. based excess mortality such, there's reason believe we're undercounting mortality somewhere range 30-50%. puts us 60-ish/100,000.

You right single month numbers - however, places like Belgium Italy got hit best practices shared higher per month numbers flu seasons.

We pace 100 deaths per 100,000 right now, despite various intense mitigation strategies. argue flu seasons bad based numbers measure different things(confirmed vs. including influenza-like) ignore mitigation efforts fairly flawed. How’s feel giant cockboy? thinking trying out! How’s feel giant cockboy? thinking trying out! 9/11 almost exclusively kill people already knocking death's door?

There's answer. Isn’t Trump basically forced start wearing one called patriotic? Still cringing fact presidential seal least wore one rent got increased pandemic. Landlords scum earth imo lol 7 day rolling average 1000 deaths day. averaging 500 deaths day, Sunday. fuck's sake, vaccinate them. 

You keep children cages, shoot innocent people, use prisoners literal slave labor, like moral standards golden cannot steep low enough jab person arm forcibly save life. know x... do....

Fucking love Americans. know better everyone.  possible, cheap, fast accurate change tide thing significantly. focusing vaccines wrong think, also pump money new testing methods. Judging ""adult"" Americans still act like child, shows mental age 14 year old. wonder, masks. means we’ll see alt right lunatics go even harder winter hits cases skyrocket... But, whole cycle repeats, they’ll ultimately peculiarly familiar Wikipedia entry 100 years worked several hospitals March. Many hands deck, sleeping office even get ready. (I working remotely them). idea everyone together meant could respond faster good outweighed bad. April things calmer (for office staff anyways) many hospitals sent home they've working home ever since. 

There really value physically close work. saying ""This crowded, SENSATIONALISM"" ""This bullshit"" need consider many hands touch thing throughout day. Let's talk chair eatery. One chair. touched moved time people's masks hands direct contact face mouth. get eat, touch face put mask again, move chair back. Repeat hundreds individuals sitting chair daily. railing one queues? many people blindly touch rails day? Merchandise? Endless amount objects shared hands day. 


Let's take step further. I'm sure people vacationing visiting major disregard actions protecting virus. Maybe even believe real. high risk individuals. Easier contract, easier spread. 

Let's take another step further. I'm sure people eating inside air conditioned environments masks off. Air conditioning known factor transmission indoors. eat drink, may sneeze cough, talk loud friends, etc. Seems like fantastic environment virus spread. (correct I'm wrong, imagine case god Florida summer without access AC seems impossible). 

I guess I'm sure expected Disney, could damn well afford remain close protect workers, thousands kids families contamination. Fuck them. nightmare. Seems won. wearing masks new covid! Everyone get stimulated speak. going work this, healthcare, food service (grocery), actual essential work like bar something, get PLUS extra. There, problem solved. :) someone essential hasn’t day since started. Oh man, got tested 2 weeks ago coworker tested positive results took 4 days. Sucks people waiting 16 D: kind delay - 6 months virus - really travesty. taken time read article explains antibody effect, even though antibody markers present, mean I'm good go. several different strains SARS covid 19. get virus contact different strain. Trying quickly catch Corona next lockdown. Smart move.

Soooo we're fucked Ayt, hope enjoy potential diabetes, multi organ failure, clots permanent breathing issues  Yeah pandemic stopped immunity, masks. vaccines PCR tests back then, herd immunity option. world, that's already happened month. \*speaking bullhorn\* RONA AIRBORNE. ELSE EXPECT GO? one developed oxford actually developed half decade, based previous pandemic New cases US clearly diminishing. What's explanation that? problems whatsoever players volunteering take risk play professional football multi million dollar salaries. NFL players it’s going dropping like flies, happen players test positive asymptomatic people like Howell season shut think it’s right thing do. Every job requires people take risks exposed virus, shouldn’t bend backwards protect NFL players. don’t want play, opt out. It’s simple. don’t need cancel NFL season. grown ass man know risks. confirm, coworker vacationed past week bf daughter (from VA). 

Can't wait start work today rest us! /s

Oh btw we're healthcare it'll great ends asymptomatic presymptomatic infects patients. Trump pick Fauci though. Fauci's part administration; he's government worker. public health advisor every president since Reagan. reason Fauci member Coronavirus Task Force default position director NIAID. 

I'm gonna argue he's perfect. He's made mistakes he's qualified person leadership position spearheading vaccine effort. work contributed humanity's greater understandings HIV/AIDs, Ebola, myriad diseases. Keep mind we're dealing new virus. We're learning everyday thru that, continually adjust tackle pandemic.  Great! perform inception every member Congress?  Tosh. Make mandatory UK Europe. sounds like good idea paper doubt could create effective plan it. much money give people get wear masks socially distance? would substantial since people would dismiss pittance. 
How verify taking government check laughing? honor system people refuse masks lives stake? 

I'm small government think clearly case need stick carrot. looking 'yesterday's' numbers, seems deaths across map super low compared record days days ago...? looks fishy. Hep B shots young teen got nausea, fatigue chills couple days first course (it two rounds), to, I'd again.

If told would definitely get headache, chills *and* myalgia couple days/a week, I'd first line.

Pain injection site common. shots usually hurt next day *pump fluid you*. reported 'no edited titles'

The research really interesting, thread title gives totally incorrect impression. becomes dangerous imho, people may start thinking immune virus. Funny somewhat intelligible conversation here.


China underreports - Propaganda FUCK CCP
Entire US corrupt fuck - Oh wonder say now. Oh horrified.


Fucking reddit. First came for... People like waste oxygen don’t understand care. want difficult. It’s over. It’s summer we’ve plenty people traveling states attend revivals complete christian concerts river baptisms county. excuse always organizers much concerned people’s souls coronavirus. Irritates hell locals. idea shutting NFL season ridiculous. athletes making millions upon millions dollars, want take risk let them. shape athletes prime life, aren’t part demographic high-risk.

Yes, understand players could transmit virus people outside NFL community, something going work with/deal with. idea shut NFL season players made asymptomatically test positive virus absurd. really, really want everything shut forever. Last time year billionaires tv crying bernie going win it. Damn felt good. Actually modern vaccines take 3 years stupidity disgusting completely different line work, war (so say) fighting country gun. I'm hospital pandemic saving desperately people's life's also preparing bodies morgue.
I admire anyone service army anyone police force, ot takes lot courage.
But please come bullshit comparing different scenarios.
Who's gonna pay increase salary? included, forget pay taxes well, comes pocket, fell threatened trying steal money.
And get facts straight, elective surgeries started long time ago, we've kidney liver transplants non stop last 2 half months, started almost entirety elective lists past month. yea, healthcare working full blast ""normal"" state. thick skull person understand happened last months, still happening, feel read bit more.
Take care. America sick ways one. everybody gets tested actually it. county &lt;1% positive, hopes keep way. means little infection community. 30% coming back positive means virus running control. print deteoriated like heck He'd insane that...shit, going happen. Must 2 America’s That's said transition pretty ...... runs country..... like 7 day averages Don’t care. I’ll ask em menthol. teacher too. write experience seen colleagues go through. Every teacher different experience many almost experienced burnout least point. Almost teachers know point especially best ones. 

You say go back work long term jobs. see case. Could elaborate give support that? 

 wonder following research places risky. experts put grocery stores low risk level. people stay grocery stores long hours stores know big open rather small cramped. Customers get get out. hand class middle school students sit well ventilated crowded room 7 hours. experts say exposure increases longer exposure. 

 Furthermore named gas stations named grocery stores. way could virtual gas stations virtual grocery stores would. fact get groceries delivered online apps way make virtual possible. I'm hypocritical stance reducing exposure grocery store workers staying home. opportunity virtual school even drawbacks.

The research vaccine encouraging. far seen positive results multiple Accident trials animals humans. impossible think could vaccine January. virtual schools could keep numbers spread much lower.

 Anyway say would like go school teachum's kids person I'm sure places find. private schools area still want person school. I'm pregnant high risk pregnancy history infected tuberculosis volunteer work decade ago. wanna get viral pandemic lungs help it. Surely reasonable understanding person would understand why. want go teach person go it. please volunteer speak me. Speak you. Zero reports starvation even weight loss far. reports hungry kids food banks mostly hand junk food kids guaranteed eat...Fruit Loops, Poptarts, mac&amp;cheese, juice boxes, goldfish crackers. kids getting calories experiencing sugar spikes drops oatmeal could easily fix. seeing 30% March April cases getting reinfected US, currently happening, even NYC. We're well pandemic US...

Even immunity, see handful reinfections everyone perfect immune system. Furthermore, know relapses thing now, differentiate relapse reinfection. insignificant portion infected, short term disease. ""So far"" key take away. sort I’ve saying. good example Michigan, every casino strictly required masks ever since reopened. combined high-tech ventilation systems (which already due smoking) made yet hear big spreading happening there. seems way things right now, you’re much safer larger organization strictly requiring masks little local restaurant doesn’t care you’re doing. That's September October schools open. Biden wins - sometime end Q1 next year

Trump wins - never us first half, gonna lie hours. like take mental breaks, too. father's research MD though he's concerned patients ongoing renal, cardiac pulmonary issues, he's saving doomsaying neurological complications.

There's way earth provide care need 20% Covid survivors develop chronic fatigue early onset dementia.

The research thin, though studies support concern community talks lot, since data yet make confident, they're saying publicly. Yet. thought countries southern border supposed wide open same?  say seen small countries. Look Portland protests suddenly “riots” news. It’s dehumanization tactic. evolving thing. think hottest states May-early July cooling off, number states showing signs heating up.

it comes opening schools. folks ""believe"" science better take look back fucking thankful live 21 century massive global pandemic 1350 want be. prayer medicinal substance around. smartest people world ones saving lives children. Nothing else, period. Whites, really going downfall heard youth get educated don’t want take honest dead-end jobs working massive soulless companies. Get load that! parents people. It’s frustrating hear Tucker Carlson Fox News, doesn’t give sources entertainment show (there absolutely way I’d ever classify news anchor.) ask parents sources, say Fox News like that’s end all, holy grail TV. 

Anyways, I’d like real sources share them- know could find classifications people died Covid vs Covid? No. Florida releases bogus numbers state report make things look rosier are. DOH dashboard actually keeps (more) accurate numbers - people look state report - Florida knows that's it. classic four loko. new, watered “won’t kill you” shit contrary; Americans putting fight help spread disease. Unfuckingbelieveable. Canadian watching form outside, really can't wrap head around complete shit show happening throughout United States right now. get believe it. 

Ah, Herman Cain way. Testing good thing. Yes would great accurate numbers. two think testing important. allows positive people self quarantine. Well clearly, beat virus acting tough. what's tougher bunch dudes dressed tight leather looking like got gay porn flick? theyre partying. young ppl partying. remember January, near-daily audio briefings CDC, one thing remember clearly CDC host call saying personally conversations family virus going change lifestyle. 

That really hit made pay attention going much much deeply.

...not sure CDC sidelined that. Finally good news “Same time tomorrow?” Definitely won’t problem countries universal healthcare Oh, guess virus gave exception protesters? knew? guess virus decided infect protestors. cure everyone! Don’t gather large UNLESS you’re protesting! Yea...let's hope people die teach Zealanders meaning humility! /s

P.S. shitty person wonder “vaping sickness” remember hearing around time, teens vaped contact vaping suddenly ending hospital severe respiratory distress, lungs rotted that. 

I think time “blaming” vaping made sense especially since might thing “outlier” kids- since know severely ill patients young ones rare disease whole, remember reading articles saying vaping sickness causing blood clots, numbness extremities, fatigue, destroying heart cells- sounds lot like coronavirus. live Canada parents left home alone 10 years old time. parents really teach lot life skills tbh, loving parents bit overprotective kid teach cook etc.

They started leaving alone couple hours soon would full day sometimes though every day. think neglect all, loved parents loved me, still do, much difference one hour 8. left alone day prepare lunch course expected everyday self motivate school work. FYI purchase toilet bowl decal old orange skinned mans face. mouth open lines drain. thought purchasing one seems evidence would enjoy face looking peed going hold back. actually good know (that rapid testing happening, counting). [Rapid testing way Tests take week useless preventing spread. Rapid tests immediately tell people need isolate need isolate, lowering R. happening large numbers 'under radar' Texas, could legitimately contributing lowering spread there, regardless official reported numbers. stop giving idiots soapbox speak? wish sentence stopped 3 words sooner. Shame. know, mostly contrived reference joke :) slogan made blood boil What's reported white house care given people COVID, rate deaths infections. That's still reported trustable manner. Simply matter time. places experience also end time. Yet simply something U.S. ignored decades highlighted another level pandemic. U.S. normal times many messed things, ignore it’s much work. I’m sure answer school districts like covid, it’s easy. really say shit, ignored almost every potential cataclysmic issue country decades that’s sustainable crisis inevitable. I'm English teacher, get paid that. much actually see one eye stone triangle? Denial insane degree. Politicians worried average person, given travel interaction voters, staff. maybe earned pushing restrictive lockdown. *ONE* bedroom $1400+ new *low* median!? *fuck*? anyone even live places? many people high paying jobs afford cities? France June 16th: Covid-19 deaths: 29,514 reported excess deaths: 26,791  


US July 18th: Covid-19 deaths 143000, excess deaths 190000.  every two days like even covid yea, part surgeons interact nearly daily think come elective surgery despite risk. issue gone longer anticipated public may may support (btw, do. Polls show consistently majority supports mask mandates/shutdowns etc) mean laws mandates enforceable. 

Just agree understand law works, mean legitimate. try conflate principles democracy. public health public health only. fully within confines law democracy. issue one created lack understanding law system. Lol fuck Maybe thry sign waiver saying wont seek receive hospital treatment covid. white Exactly. look one replies postnasal drip: sign? annoying thing get episodes times year. feel school district making tough right decision here. online learning option. ""send kids school"" option.

Originally two options: (1) online only; (2) hybrid online/in school. superintendent said ""Sorry, offered choices, thought could safely start school - enough people chose online lower student teacher counts - thought decided safely offer hybrid choice withdrawing option.""

Believe me, plenty parents pissed many still are. personally supported 100% popular. believe decision soon vindicated. dynamic that's striking lot wealthier neighborhoods touristy ones. residents means bail Hamptons wherever suddenly local businesses lost entire customer base lot local institutions lost. 
 
There's different dynamic playing outer boroughs. working class residents remain city continue order local establishments. I've heard (not all) restaurants saying they're holding okay this. country goes one extreme another. Used kids went work farm factory. Now, endlessly coddled lack real world skills result, much stunted emotionally otherwise. 

Social media full kids depressed even suicidal. People seek friendships people online hard time expressing person. 

it's real shame really. What's point making money fancy home time kids? American born US citizen. changed that? Money make citizen, simply marrying non citizen changed status apparently. man telling public literally nothing information person actually something touting opposite? Worse, absolutely asinine group doctors message spread every social media platform saying again, opposite man saying. anyone afraid right thing speak actual person something least say public setting? Nobody arguing whether excess deaths. said genuinely caused covid. Others deaths caused things people covid (where contributing factor). finally there's deaths attributed effects widespread lockdowns. culminate 'excess' deaths Trump thinks he’s great job. Source? Generally medical test results given phone. leave voicemail either, request call back make sure actually phone. takes hundred thousand keep country turning fascist wasteland book. Incorrect.  see gotta e mean trying help  antivirals? no. sex? maybe. think done correct upward curve seeing right next 30 days? noticed this. bound crash sometime soon. reflect reality America going through. feel like well companies used ppp tax cuts bolster stocks. Creating false reality economy well get back work!

When know pandemic going on. one wants sacrifice corporation. stuck mindset working live. 

My roommate told stop pretending im apart problem! works 5 days week hotel manager diabetes autoimmune compromised. use work gig economy stopped pandemic. Fuck corporations Reading comprehension tough sometimes, get it. want moms school district test faculty, teaches their, right quarantine started, principal held even gym students teachers 0 social distancing. Look spin will.

But affects property values. That’s reality. economy fucking toast years happening world. Berlin huge anti-mask protest.

Stupidity knows borders. Intentionally crippling national response fucking specific states political gain makes terrorism. believe kill minorities chosen flavor white makes genocide. We're miles beyond incompetence. actively trying make worse particular groups. can't believe would suggest thing. complety untrue. 

What see ""entertainment product"" *generates* money. district live scrap entire master schedule Thursday (school starts Wednesday) due many teachers enough students coming due Covid.

I'm germany remembering back always came back school empty house. parents working times would see weekends.

In America use call ""Latch-key kids"", perfectly normal arrive home school (or several) hours parents would get back home evening. growing eighties pretty common kid above, oh eight years order.  
 
So, experience Germany also common US well...or used be. quite shift past decades, seems like kids need glued parents 24/7. used go ride bike weekends sunset - today likely concerned citizen call cops parents would get meeting Child Protective Services neglect abandonment.  
 
Honestly, older kids would perfectly fine without constant supervision. look forward time returns back acceptable. FYI quote fake; Stalin never said that. someone asks smoke.

There still restrictions visit nursing homes - say general restriction visits. 
No masks required, unless deal sick people; sick stay home get sick benefits (as usual).

How well work? Well, worse European countries: especially tourist places unfortunately overcrowded, Stockholm (biggest city) Uppsala (4th biggest) feel almost empty.

The one thing bothers quarantine can't get tested way shorten quarantine. got tested U.S. coming Canada, I'd happy get tested Canada. think two consecutive negative tests excuse quarantine.

Also, I'm sorry naive believe people complying quarantine. enforcement nice lady calling asking still quarantine also two automated phone calls thanking quarantine.

Someones immune system catching Sars-Cov2 without ever vaccinated catching coronavirus cold, go library, find instruction book list chemicals make fire retardant, bring home, start experimenting quantities etc hits right compound. time Virus/Fire replicating spreading throughout body/house. 

Thats important minimise Viral/Fire load even can't actually prevent infection/fire starting. Sprinkler system might prevent fire keeps fire low level till Fire Service arrives. homemade mask might offer 99% protection, persons 50% effective mask 50% effective mask combined probably prevent getting hit cough/sneeze mega-dose viral load huge headstart would replicate point symptoms viral shedding within couple days, long immune system even got back library instruction book. time immune system worked recipe fire retardant high starting viral load couple days replication like trying put house fire small handheld extinguisher. ie. worked fire retardant recipe use handheld extinguisher raging house fire?

Those us caught related corona-virus past vaccinated like we've put away instruction book kitchen drawer (Antibodies gone blood months) forgotten read, put book, returned instruction book library (We still Memory cells recognise virus). catch Sars-Cov2. virus replication doubles every 4 hours infection started low viral load takes week replication hit symptomatic viral shedding levels. Plenty time immune system get instruction book kitchen drawer cook fire retardant. immune system one headstart time virus handicapped low viral load starting point, like putting lit match hand held fire extinguisher. ie. never even know caught Sars-Cov 2 Vaccine/Previous Coronavirus exposure gave immune system headstart needed stay one step ahead virus. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* ever Alabama? day ends really... looked up, hard small round circles old time people put feet got corns.  guess epidemiologist receive harsh tweets next 24 hours.

Indeed. 3m biggest maker far, least US.

N95 respirators - rated block 95% specified sizes particulate. dry virion Covid-19 falls size, that's issue covid exhalation plumes ""mounted"" droplets moisture/mucus much, much larger . New masks actually catch 99%, ratings lowered account discharge storage time, trying account performance actually used. similar expiration dates: probably lasts longer, safer overshoot liability purposes.

This rating valid fit proper: quite tight sealed skin. facial hair; makeup. may need tighten straps slightly. shapes fit faces. fit tested chemical - bitter sweet spray blocked mask, smell/taste it, fit off. Without access trained pro fit you, compensate going bit tighter. Check fit exhaling inhaling quickly see edges leaking.

An improperly fitted n95 guaranteed perform rated levels, step surgical masks, fitted charged mbpp layers, cloth masks, crude filters unknown/varying filtration efficiency. Invented masks effective; hot unpleasant. Vented respirators protect wearer, offer protection others, much unvented, exhalation plume leak front mask, intent, although indirectly, hits membrane goes around, hits housing vents sides. better letting projected freely. Again, situation occurs surgical masks, sealed either, allowing leakage.


There proper procedure donning doffing; main idea touch little possible, freshly washed hands, especially avoid touching inside, holding edges straps, fit face, lift bottom strap over, followed top strap. careful break them. 

N95s electrostatically charged, mbpp layers are, attract hold particulate like staticy shirt attracts lint. lose charge slowly time expire reason.

N95s are, used be, single-use, disposable items. published, past, ""extended use"" ""limited re-use"" protocols emergency shortages. amounted wearing one going multiple rooms necessary, taking outside room hanging bag. Since n95s widely used non-infectious particulate like dust, already routine workers certain industries wear entire shift.

What means practice one mask carefully protected last long. careful handling, try leave long possible rather removing frequently. removal, store paper bag reuse.

Diluted bleach alcohol destroy electrostatic charge severely damage respirator, although appears functional intact. clean disinfect anything containing alcohol. best option moment vaporized hydrogen peroxide, probably access rig use it, building one harbor freight vacuum pots would possible require decent amount expertise, that's out.

It’s quite clear story we’re getting isn’t true. 

That isn’t reason Fauci, cdc, said masks wouldn’t work March. 

They recommending masks made materials everyone access March. 

There shortage bandanas cloth. problem need wait problem occurred resulting people hurt park becoming unsafe space. Also I'm sure everyone seen someone heavily drunk public makes everyone uncomfortable feel unsafe, ruins place everyone else explicitly done anything illegal yet. said DJ callous World Trade Center destroyed, said tallest building New York. wonder telling anyone deaths per day country world? 🦞🦞🦞 go protest instead told someone quite posting bullshit Facebook aligned views posted meme stating Dr. Fauci married Ghislaine Maxwell’s sister, told keep “lib shit” page. didn’t care spreading propaganda obviously untrue, don’t agree current admin. guess people say borders glad border exists lmao gained politically 9/11 - fat government contracts hand friends, easier re-election bids wrap flag, foreign lands invade resources seize, etc. pandemic get honor telling people they’ll unemployed, wear masks months, etc. Also, US uniquely unqualified individual White House this. can’t America. We’re “freedom” aren’t smart. YouTube (or social media generally) didn’t make stupid gullible, know? internet weren’t thing, they’d getting bad information elsewhere. 

Oh, right, social media hastens spread bad info...it allows conspiracy theorists easily find other. 

On second thought, you’re probably right. report research arm Iranian [**Parliament April estimated death toll could twice official figure total infections 10 times higher, also predicted second wave relate Florida counts percent positive differently states? true, alot times delivery soon spoils outcome. said yesterday, still baffles mind many people care hundreds thousands people dying virus.

Whether big school building small place kids taught neighbor one family, they're still getting together, swapping germs, sending around- do, they'll pass families, who'll pass around. There's way around it- children getting together, way, explode things.

It really hope otherwise, bringing kids gathering school would go past ""die economy"" go straight ""I'm sick kids bugging me, least die I'll eternity peace quiet."" Stress gonna kill well corona can. mean giving chocolate 3 weeks Good question, sure. 

I would say
1) probably many people know it, doctors also focused modern treatments like insulin pumps. 
2) novolin really tremendous step backwards terms treatment quality life you’re used fast acting. also adhere strict eating schedule, predetermined amount carbohydrates every 2-3 hours avoid hypoglycemia (can Lead seizures death extreme cases). Imagine parent trying get kid eat like that. could pretty easily kill switching novolin aren’t careful. coworker says it’s good loud cars hear road 🤷🏼‍♀️

I’d rather Indian though. Unfortunately lot Christians today act like Pharisees, that’s many people hate Christians. that’s also problem - Pharisee like “Christians” aren’t real Christians all. give real Christians bad rap. case particular church - doesn’t seem like intent corporate prayer Pharisee-like. stated Matthew 18-19:20, group prayer something Christians unite petition prayers Jesus together. happens church lot members well.

CBS : Votto fourth Reds position player either placed COVID-19 injured list sidelined possible symptoms since Opening Day. Matt Davidson tested positive one day new season.

MLB's new COVID-19 injured list comes minimum maximum stay, players must test negative twice least 24 hours apart activated. Votto presumably tested Sunday Tuesday. come back negative, return. 

The 2020 Operations Manual requires players self-report possible COVID-19 symptoms, including headache, fatigue, muscle soreness, elevated temperature. Neither Moustakas Senzel tested positive, creating concern players may hide symptoms avoid held action. would potentially disastrous. true all. immunity lasts 6 months would tiny number people even virus 6 months ago reinfected. might think mild cases, new studies say not.

Ok hate much next person agree cult background checks members sign work kids way Yep, vaccine unintended side effects, like say it'd much better find 80 year-old vaccinated personal safety live ~10 years 15 year old mostly vaccinated benefit others deal ~70 years. 'Rona DeathSentence. Smart. c'mon much ask lot people America.  thought established months ago. 65+ age group targeted virus.. also lots corona viruses, we'd probably called chest cold year ago. know pesky rules us plebs? seems distasteful generalized. plenty athletes care family, town, city, state. also plenty intelligent responsible.

Don’t generalize population make seem better like Cassandra Fall Troy, cursed foresight nobody takes seriously. probably right would probably improve situation, kinda doubt public schools able afford one every student. mistake, misread Yes, that's whole different level.... average intelligence smarter half population.

Idk percentile average someone becomes stupid enough stop listening smart people, US really fucking large chunk curve. I'm repeating months people involved vaccines said past. think I've read September Oxford October moderna. understanding (very limited understanding) phase 3 declared success % control group caught covid. given number countries running trends virus countries, expect happen fairly quickly. states demanding kids return person also closing quarantine ""loophole"", prevent one many cases shutting entire schools down. know students test positive. think reason stop schooling. volume. Calulation simpler. use weights, accurate , requires work. Someone needs get major news network run story I'm praying one side effects pandemic legalized hard liquor delivery. What? significant amount people won’t get vaccinated. What’s source vaccine ready November?! Btw terrible guessing. Amen. I'm tired asinine predictions short-term extensions immediate state affairs. Nah got canes. Thanks though! Governments always know something public doesn’t. Always. mean? Anyone thinks coronavirus hoax, go back line. USA cover cases way election over. Saying Trump Defeated Virus magically disappear. 

Then USA votes Trump. Watch numbers keep dropping November. Lol...who told ,😂😂😂. PETA nothing paid organization. Medical professionals first. They're putting lives line save ours. LOL.

Personally feel meat fine long endangered, stolen, unhygienic killed deliberately cruel manner. time het PCR test results, either dead.. Everyone needs getting quick test weekly spreaders found isolated. Trust nobody wants go right now, except *maybe* Americans. Yes President Trump LEAD world USA #1 USA USA 

In Trump Trust. 

/s Lock in, forget them. Well, let's critical thinking here.

First - Fauci politician. job prevent mitigate impact pandemic, give opinion political matters. He's done 6 presidents.

Second - think death rates going do, especially steadily get better understanding thing? think mortality rate going get worse? total number deaths increasing, infection rate. 

Third - Remdesivir affect liver, sure, used safely non-liver-damaged patients via daily monitoring regulation liver enzymes. However, guess else screws liver? Ebola itself, explain issues trial. patient already liver issues cirrhosis, Remdesivir used carefully alternative route found. large, Remdesivir found moderately effective lessening length coronavirus recovery time patients, really anything much better well studied point.

Fourth - 'Second Wave' guidance came result states loosening quarantine guidelines much quickly CDC advised. never said beat first wave, correctly warn coronavirus response wasnt handled correctly front, second resurgence cases would much worse first. absolutely correct.

I'm going run space, stay tuned part two :) Shit, known Votto sick? Nobody self isolated? probably right places I’ve “flexible” rules, find Legion seem exist bubble Yeah wtf, Burning Mans cancelled dad still go bike show? Hypocrites. food 21 days? recommend good flavor aid recipe. comment it’s good post here. talks chloroquine incredibly effective treatment preventing SARS-CoV. actual links original information Journal Virology well National Institutes supplemental NIH study 2014 regarding zinc ionophore / here's article 2018 showing Hydroxychloroquine reduces cardio PubMed copy CDC article states concerns safety Hydroxychloroquine even children pregnant women "" Hydroxychloroquine relatively well tolerated medicine. preprint  story sounds really familiar. Thank you. makes sense. still received first check. think he's getting downvoted seems like he's implying France developed country, silly. Gm area same. get tested gm count test towards positive cases. Oh  Masks reduce face touching: increase adherence social distancing: etc. anti-science suggest opposite Tegnell does. people drink damn time alcohol many related deaths ruined lot families. I'm glad stigma cannabis starting slowly shift corporations shit gotta dip toes cannabis even make legal. going end Amazon Walmart left. people's freedumbs important greater good. Found one! Unfortunately increased more. Florida states covering Covid deaths. NYC greatly undercounted though probably purposeful. D614g bet. strain hit Italy. strain american south too. “While strain new Vietnam, seen Bangladesh, Britain, Ireland, according Vietnamese scientists.” Yeah non smokers die lung cancer too. like 10% rate smokers lot students (especially younger) don’t understand full risk going back might think it’s safe whatever.


Also I’m soon high school senior. Also never thought fact one talking actual students issue. talking parents, teachers, administrator people, government people, adults. lot adults letting teens children join conversation. others: Nearly Danish newspapers comment sections. comment section EkstraBladet different corona always been. yes, much extreme right stuff there. went school 8am-1pm.

that part would missing schools open up, Americans can't without Americans can't afford stay home work educate kids. brings us back original someone math please, many people would unemployed parents stay home babysit (take care children)/ homeschool them?

Kids need watched time, need someone make education work somehow. parents work day survive, schools viable option handle education part, problem. Vanishingly literal children able self-educate home alone without someone else keep focused track. like one learned marshmallow test. predict CDC wrong. Again. 

The trends point kind death toll. likely we'll see something like 8k-10k per week much month, tailing end perhaps 7k.

Remindme! 28 days Hopefully gets better living studio helped neighbor move 1 bedroom building found less space tiny rooms dividing slightly larger area studio. paid 50% me. costs extra 70k year live there, still coming behind? Right, agree. hate perspective “how people want open schools?!” Sure, extremists may *want* to, think rational people loss otherwise. It’s tough situation arguing people “want” think trying handwave issue away without really thinking it. love hate home state. Love area, hate people. Save people March already saying ""it's flu."" Source? 15-20 staff members nearby county even let students schools yet  say every one person testing positive antibodies, two people test positive T-cells.

Also antibody tests don’t capture people mild cases set baseline threshold high avoid false positives would rather false negatives false positives, avoid people walking around thinking save so. actual number probably quite bit higher. Hospitalizations much lower going Arizona weeks. would indicate things getting better.  seems reliable based reports hospital workers Arizona. admirably following guidelines get collateral splash exposure following guidelines flaunting it, also end hospital, fighting well :( receive rent/mortgage forgiveness past months, would MASSIVE burden lifted many. 

You’re right though- we’ve beaten much see small kickbacks godsend. reality, money. 

We need change. simplistic useful.  get annoying it, you?  thought silly.  

DARE Coronavirus. We're talking health information cases area. seen two months so, even pretty much even back then. wanted meet popular restaurant. used line Dr. Fauci saying two places go, airplanes restaurants.  seem care. guess like cases going death rate low, low atm.people struggle weeks sometimes they'll die. lets check death rate 2 weeks again. belive still low fine thousands people dying millions health complications? think hundreds thousands dead people impact economy?

Ever notice countries able handle virus... totally crazy thing successful lockdown. Would nice accurate rapid test medicine helps COVID? don’t say truth? can’t afford update site keep EU regulations? would get upset that? multiplied 4, depending live. severe test shortage here. 1 person tested positive house. 3 symptoms. told ""1 test per household. Presume positive &amp; quarantine."" Presumed positives added case counts. virus USA, areas mutated. Maybe better, maybe worse.

There currently 6 strains. 

Not sure got downvoted....  
 people Czech Republic think hoax PM.

Yup. could also get healthy nothing happens like millions people.

The studies sample sizes little millions people have/had it. Oh agree, though point addressing. person responding saying misinformation campaign regarding masks warranted shortage. responding care rest world seemed top pretty early on. medical community (in U.S.) adequate number masks. Many countries somehow managed secure enough masks front line workers. bought N95s back February every one still saying Flu even though Vietnam Tiawan taking pretty proactive measures, mention China shutting massive cites (larger New York). Yet supposed accept fact one could seen coming (even though World did) mask misinformation campaign justified system wanted close eyes pretend every thing business usual last second?

Seriously dude, fucking pull head asshole. They've stopped getting worse. much they're improving questionable collapse testing state enormous lag inconsistency death reports. 

They ran 8k tests here, example. California might mostly Dem, it’s still got significant conservative minority, especially rural parts. It’s big state. True, America land “I got mine, fuck you”. Thats original plan, desensitize. like middle east war still going today. might forgotten already coz desensitized. Itsa new norm.

Tegnell put [the kibosh tracing app due high spread Sweden, even though there's small movement towards transitioning towards Test, Trace, Isolate Sweden, discussion new app I've seen anyway. They’re going pull bootstraps figure out.

Functionally, mean? Like actionable ultimately, chose baby, chose raise kid—and responsible parents save money babysitters case something like happens.

I’m sure agree something everyone should’ve seen coming reasonably prepared for. Saving emergency days, weeks, even month two - it. full school semester (or more)? think young families ready take hit, you’re woefully disconnected reality. child go summer school out? Summer break?

Sometimes family - stay grandparents bit. Sometimes go summer camps. Parents also don’t worry education (because it’s short break) importantly known consideration beginning (from first considered children). Covid-induced school closures not. data sooooo place damn confused process state doing.

They're purpose muddy water can't get clear picture give trying figure out. countries, like ones Europe deaths per capita. get huge laundry list blame countries well? Quite low, despite read others surely downvote reply scary preprint studies non randomized controls. incidence rate trend downward along death rate. cities contracted covid. lasting effects serious issue large percentage, would know know (outside scary internet anecdotes surely flooded with) South Sudan Kosovo, know pretty much covered.. Next plum dipped perfume man's hat happily support random Dutch people calling fucking dumbass.

Thanks. Hopefully die stroke then. solution sending kids school instead send daycare? Within week other? delusion rampant Lmfao culturally American. 

You made spit tea good sir/madam, kudos. Russia still heavily involved online disinformation campaigns. problem people pointing Russia's negative actions state actor. 

It's making false assumption one entity provably engage misinformation, information must misinformation misinformation comes them. true almost counties less 30% tests come back positive? counties &lt;1% positive, would obviously impossible claim true. Simply married someone citizen yet disqualifies American citizen getting anything. workplace saying :"" Nothing bad, doesnt something Positive.""

I'm still sure 'Old people dying dont need benefits anymore' ist positive.

From pragmatic point view maybe yes think many people dont wabt grandparent parents die like that. know works countries journalists incredibly biased India.

Anything shows left bad light barely even reported upon. Terrorist called ""gunmen"" suits propaganda. bodies perspective lightly stabbed takes care that. discovers virus prepares defenses fever realises going anything learns stops fever. really side effect natural effect ""Put masks up..."" *mask down* LOL 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's example JHU clearly saying affect data. 

The CDC data affecting hospitalization data - really low quality right it. However, case numbers affected. 

Don't fall conspiracy theories, there's evidence national data tampered - excluding hospitalizations obviously. But. They. Are. At. A. Football. Game. During. A. Pandemic. party go states likely opening irresponsibly means less people eligible UI, aka lower unemployment. Basically bluff attempting let hurt constituents. think least. 

Also fucking exhausting trying trip arbitrary filter sub. post allowed exist able discuss politics behind it. One teacher’s life loss due irresponsibility appreciation tragedy worth caring about.  people want get vaccinated get vaccinated asap, rest want take change minds. \[Yes, imagine reading peer sourced articles base claims rather throwing random absolutes\]( ) mean downplay seriousness crisis, I'm definitely self-aware enough realize personal anecdotal experience means approximately nothing regard what's happening across country. truly tons people seriously ill even asymptomatic (on order 8-10x reported numbers, say) suppose probably know someone even know themselves. think big media houses arent covering this? Surely people NYT cnn caught this? words, even worse thought. One teacher..not some. One special ed teacher. retire age 65..full pension. Assuming age 62 28 years teaching.

Say high pay 50K year bit median nebraska. ..her retirement 28,000 year. Plus suppose get social security early too.

So some...one. made good choice financially good too. paramedic friend taught wife give vitamin B injections. WAY better doc I've too. Barely even feel it. Mr Microsoft killing tons African kids providing vaccines us? thanks sheep. technically flag code wear US flag piece clothing? know that. :( district hasn’t reopened yet I’m mainly venting area area family lives works in. thank that, interesting excess deaths missing compared countries much. EU reports excess deaths month. Russia seems like takes much longer month. countries cannot trust all. 


For missed Covid deaths problem ofc. sense understand hardest first hit states like NY lack testing hard ca understand miss. Texas looks bad though. 

If look Europe countries missed lot too, e.g. Spain, UK. e.g France Belgium excess death reported Covid. know Sweden reported 90% Covid deaths within like 14 days got like 5% excess deaths Covid.  


In Russia takes moths report Covid deaths, seem miss lot, Regions 20 times covid deaths reported. China countries cannot trust all. 


Imo even US reporting perfectly nothing completely chart. Still riding wave 1 stabbed causes pain knew. Would rather lightly stabbed die honest Yeah read now. OP spreading misinformation paper claims. Exponential growth helluva drug many districts including one live aren’t requiring kids mask all. teachers staff. kids parent someone home infects kid, kid infect kids unless teacher access face shield n95 aka proper PPE good chance teachers get many teachers know love older and/or pre-existing conditions absolutely higher risk average kid. Yea! driving sober makes feel safe fine, safe choose drive drunk!! driving sober right keeps safe right?? Duh!! heck, didn’t symptoms whatsoever mine? Found Yogi Berra! still can't get badly misplayed early thinking going affect WA/CA/NY/NJ. are. Everywhere fire. It’s crazy 100 years pandemic it’s exact thing agree. I've always really good relationships kids thing bonded us ever. understand complaining spend time one's kids. 2020 trying 40k? Like chilling people start worshipping Nurgle. title paper, post.
The paper says 81% uninfected people tested t-cells already armed anti bodies effect covid-19. Think like boxer walking UFC ring, may get ass kicked bad kid works subway would. It’s unreasonable, it’s realistic. Many parents involved children’s educations assuming would lead many children struggling excessively. Ehhh it’s it’s Disney World Florida July people two layers masks on; relaxation zones still properly socially distanced cast members entrances assist reminding families rules disinfect area leave. 

Disney image safety cleanliness maintain they’re also still business Florida won’t put foot I’m least glad Disney trying safest can. Rabies vaccine left pretty sore arm two weeks. first second one fine third one terrible. Fear mind-killer. Yes that's alot people too. supposed disqualify something? every. Sweden got almost 0% difference compared 5 years average satan you? COVID going end era many middle class workers. Lots companies got fat past decade.

With WFH furloughs companies going much better idea positions actually needed. Anyone who’s worked medium larger company knows usually plenty folks making good money little. 

This gonna hit middle class pretty hard. company parking lot half empty business literally hummed along close normal email warriors home. Ah well spoonful sugar helps hydroxychloroquine go down, right?

Sorry Trump peoole I'm really tired idea expecting parents parent completely unreasonable. Masks made cotton fabic efective enaugh (like dust particle going tru chicken fence) Stole comment sub refer:

It mean 81% immune covid19, 81% seem prior exposure another corona virus. Showing kind response may mean lighter symptoms (though authors note another study would needed confirm this), window infecting others smaller. good (less technical) summary kind research Source? might want start breathing exercises they’re going send checks even people time Children adults lives aren’t teachers, however many children teachers adults involved education, adults either don’t time, skills, inclination be. Ah yes people feeling great long term effects Oh sweet summer child  blacks Latinos affected disproportionately? so-called “developing” countries, far less resources fewer technological talents - like Vietnam instance, south east Asia countries - managed get top virus infection control Europe, USA etc failed badly? purely general public? Every. Damn. Thread.

Can't people stick topic instead making everything politics?

It's like sick head something. Source? Wear mask. 90% (R) thing far tell here. Sorry loss. Corona absolute nightmare. boggles mind people unaware reality we’re living. Feels like episode Black Mirror Twilight Zone. Sometimes ask myself, ""Do people really want watch world burn?"" times tell myself, ""Fuck it, want watch world burn."" 1. I'm US, though respect Fauci
2. I'm responding person me, whose comment took nobody would want vaccine comes countries anyway, think oversimplified 
3. comment suggests, *if* studies *and intelligence* (because might trust studies countries) showed safe effective vaccinate people, whatever reason west close one, necessarily turn offered. 

My point politicians loves drum fear hate towards countries, absolutely warrants mistrust (Novichok poisonings, anyone? 😒), necessarily mean could never produce something worthwhile us. string attached acknowledging successfully us, pride good reason continue endanger citizens' lives.

But tbh think unlikely - imagine may hot heels, probably safety and/or effectiveness concerns (and possibly given reduced requirements), strings would probably want attach sharing vaccines could beyond considering national safety. 

I want people rational scepticisms, fearmongered xenophobia (which Fauci do, plenty politicians given slightest chance) first statement largely refers printing press historical context regarding small independent newspapers simpler times literacy still considered gift. internet social media twitter turn millennium, unknown opinion become “news” origins statements easily disappear web. non-existent barriers placing thoughts wider world difficulty verifying veracity statements make misleading public simple task. Many people mistake opinion fact—largely like appear well informed don’t wisdom education tell two apart. Reconsider Wouldn’t better go game? seems like more, masks used excuse engage social distancing. Right. also help. People named Americanes go house? actually eleven sixty-fourths imperial units. eleven sixty-four Canadians willing travel US. People need able trust institutions know honest- otherwise millions millions people avoid vaccine.

We thinking decades. Instead people shown institutions honest put profit human life. recent examples doctors caught accepting bribes give patients opioids need FDA's approval dangerous medication without review without review Drug Safety Risk Management Advisory Committee input advisory committee analgesics anesthetic drug products prompting [protest within time [further afterwards. also scientists knowingly unknowingly used misrepresent facts benefit corporations industry, scientific journals shown publishing garbage never accepted, federal regulations cut risk health lives people, etc. 

I'm antivaxxer, fact I'm eagerly awaiting vaccine virus, can't blame anyone point concerned safety considering repeated failures regulate hold accountable people need everyone trust now. would take long time rebuild trust already lost I'm seeing much effort even try.  title LITERAL STATISTIC. misunderstood meant, idiot. Poor analogy dash really researching science Interesting, mine lasted day. know many round trials? Truth tho Holy fucking shit LMAO totally see that. took nosedive since June riots started ""second wave"" came out. yes, seems 40 percent population support matter says.  Really interesting see winter going like. restaurants continue outdoor dining, many homeless point, people lining around blocks subzero temps food bank. One hopeful thing people huddle inside. No, they're testing effectiveness. side effects, ,will already known adapting flu shot already adding Coronavirus antibodies - like new cocktail chemicals - that's say monitoring side effects - within scope effectiveness Corona. 

They expose anyone virus - we're volunteers regular lives, way works work sets volunteers. first round Jenner trial, trial, 500 volunteers. 4 weeks, round two 1000, round I'm 10,000 spread around UK. deliberately expose anyone, start small set monitor effects, see anyone come Corona set in, placebo vaccine, move larger scales successive success. 

My first check 4 weeks shot draw blood check antibody levels, I'll another 8 week check, another 16 weeks, whole monitoring year. aim create shot lasts least year, permanently, last beyond weeks seen success. (so far, shot seems effective getting virus) 

With 10,000 us plot expectation us get Corona anyway, statistically - that's questionnaire I've I've done many people.If everyone says free Coronavirus also stayed indoors alone, indicate much. Interestingly, moving next round vaccine trials round testers reporting back free virus, indicating vaccine works, they're looking countries much bigger spikes like Brazil test virus rate low UK give meaningful data. bear mind volunteers leave moment without reason without questions asked. 

It's important note though testing small degree imprecise science way, morally, ethically, legally, trial inject random cocktails chemicals expose virus. works - every time vaccine reaches human many rigorous sets tests built pre existing shots proven work - administered watch people go lives way would anyway, draw conclusions. That's takes need many people. volunteer! free, get regular testing, contributing swifter development thing end horrible pandemic good save lives. Plus may receive vaccine anyone else. want click find out! Well test pick costs $15 takes 30 minutes. Hopefully roll soon.   **May**. symptoms persist long illness, cause worry mean 81% immune covid19, 81% seem prior exposure another corona virus. Showing kind response may mean lighter symptoms (though authors note another study would needed confirm this), window infecting others smaller. good (less technical) summary kind research Y’all mad confusing lmao. Like I’m confused people stand vaccines. Like almost everyone keep screeching won’t take vaccine comes. Like you’d rather covid ? Lol clearly it’s deep then. true would let cat bag. Technology improved fewer people amount work. There’s lot people 2 hours work 8 hours. Yea stuff Incorrect. Smirk. also basically moon landing itself, Soviets basically nation pig farmers decades prior kicking asses space race That's logical thing do. need people control actually get COVID know vaccine worked Pretty powerful. But, guy particular basically another Prime Minister alongside honorary PM takes many key decisions. walk two days. shit that's funny lolol Send mail ballots early October vote early voting. I’m Canada I’m horrified happening there. Please vote. care less times we're talking Covid 19.. never said take simply saying highly unusual vaccine come short time frame. secret biggest rush job history see people get touchy person questions. I'm cherry picking data points I'm stating certain aspects information feel relevant point I'm making. 
   may aware there's law place America protects vaccine makers able sued held responsible way damages injury caused vaccine. things safe Earth would law exist? Furthermore look research data vaccines find many cases far safe say least. mind questions really bad??  Insanity industry even reopened. Jfc “Challenging times” also yet peer reviewed, resistance immunity synonyms. that's mean, gonna get smacked around till change it. football game anyway tho? like masks make absolutely immune... Private Schools pissed, using opportunity boost enrollment, many private School systems support replacing public education voucher system, presumbly try fill seats lobby state federal legislators that. literally it? sacrificing time students, job. Can't kids parent help them? now, forever. 

Someone mentioned year 2022. Pandemics last years that's time-frame we're talking about. People immune thing. sure Black Swan event. buy X insurance widely, X Black Swan.

But even someone said pandemic Black Swan, US facing something US alone responsible for. country around 30,000 deaths maybe 30,000 active cases (1-2 million cases total, less snuffed slow burn). roughly western nations achieved chaos March. 

But among first world countries, US seems actively creating second wave. That's self-imposed wound less everyone could foresee (if wear parachute, probably hit ground hard die it). well July worst, worst bad live. Cases actually went bit. ME, NH, VT going really well regardless they're rural experience ton transit travel. Even densely populated towns cities full order magnitude ""actual"" cities US, including New England.

It's good place be, live Boston see people wearing masks, lot people eating, lot local college students clearly give shit. manages crawl back south midwest, explode again. Stop trying hard read things say said. millions words say, untold billions potential combinations. Rather attacking one those, try reading ones actually wrote. social distancing everyone practicing

Assuming people actually give enough damn it.

Here SoCal, one cares. Bars Restaurants packed full capacity shut 3 weeks ago. cases kinda place San Diego. 550+ one day, 280 next.. first lock 150..ish range daily beaches, bars restaurants opened doubled 8 days Ummm yes call pharmaceutical sales! Rally going happen matter Sturgis would dry get influx money Rally. 90% street front stores Main empty except three weeks Rally going on. 

Rapid, Spearfish Lead/Deadwood also enjoy influx Rally dollars.

All Sturgis stores, restaurants booths follow strict mask, cleaning disinfecting regimes.

The two week long 2020 concert series Buffalo Chip Campground festering going happen. heard Meade County put restrictions Chip.

Besides Rally also Days '76 rodeo going Deadwood. Central States Fair still go Rapid later month. short, yes, advanced degree field related data analysis. analysis back-of-napkin estimate rather anything rigorous. live Pittsburgh assure know social distance.....tons people even wear masks public.  People consider hoax say ""well death rate 3% count every death covid"" I'm like wear mask sbutup would probably know got covid 10 days potential exposure, wait 4 days absolutely sure. Yes remember parents forwarding articles “masks useless” March convince government lying. vividly remember sounding like conspiracy theorist. Like school shootings, remember extremely big deal? recent years seemed like happened least week mean watch read anything provide basically proves point really see reason. Like said interested opinions changed, validated. asked masks protect said no. already showed saying reason said masks would protect us thought doctors needed more. hey, I'm understanding, reading one paragraph staying still watch something couple minutes hard. judge harshly that. Keep good work kid. quote almost sums country right : ""The owners see us human."" taking sidelining Fauci. Trump that. Birx guilty trying upset tm tyrant chief looking way. Fauci issue birx It’s basically catastrophic insurance, get car accident costs tens hundreds thousands dollars fix up. I’m lucky really good insurance rates, basically pay $3,600 year insurance case $6,000 medical bills (my family deductible). big surgery it’ll cost $9.5k max (assuming everything in-network)...what deal. get upvote happy true actually could be....im WV soo I'd say would work some.... *begrudgingly clicks*   death rate supposed 1% less. super unlikely 1 10,000 chance, something else going here? mean....they’re gonna know regardless? 7 seconds football practice without mask doesn’t necessarily mean always that. Maybe careful aside one particularly hot day. really don’t know. disease humans eradicated, counts something. order difficulty, still impressive achievement. see above. know least one night threw rules window son would miss super cool party friends engineer doctor. could easily go sales/marketing/account management role make money room grow. People choose trap dead-end career. aren’t. go school. online entire first semester. Stocks. Must. Go. Up. Hey hey leave enough shame embarrassment us Michigan! children get educated year. end, that's less important food, shelter, dying. That's cold truth. better-functioning society, could adaptations public school system ""catch up"" lost year COVID-19 winds down... but... I'm holding breath. earn poon! heads Louisiana: really second wave, spiking different places. New Orleans definite hotspot beginning (for bit biggest hotspot entire world) thousands cases ahead everyone else third highest parish cases, bit higher month ago, nearly level crisis we're seeing Jefferson Parish, Calcasieu, Lafayette, Baton Rouge even close April. (New Orleans) recent uptick 100% us relaxing restrictions. 

In beginning New Orleans 2/3rds cases state, we're 5%-10%, sometimes less. Deeper analysis suggests lower seroprevalence needed level herd immunity might explain least partially. We're testing almost 10% population month 4% positive rate statistically safest ""big"" city South. 

If click scroll ""New COVID Cases Louisiana"" select ""Orleans"" see demonstrated clearly compared particularly EBR, Calcasieu, Lafayette. JP run idiot assholes refuse enforce shut that's crisis, close suburb New Orleans, dumbest shit ever. Lol hope live long enough see change big way. current state U.S shameful dissapointing. 

Like yeah wait elderly corrupt shmucks die brainwashed kids? get rid lunatics continue reproduce?

Some people argue better education way can’t confirm deny. Poor baby! Oh breaks heart. want give big hug hold tell going ok.  *think* agree that, it’s definitely tricky clear cut. (What teachers/faculty? Even they’re less likely transmit virus, won’t kids eventually spread amongst parents several months? Etc etc.)

It truly difficult situation around. Aaaand that's life. Thanks, shingles! end ship going up! even first lockdown many states good luck second one. reason U.S. failing badly every state left thing. need Federal intervention Government actually something, apart setting guidelines saying ""Good luck!"" state. Erm, go school Justin. online school entire semester, news came out. school district taking covid seriously. well lets put way. son's friend liberal parents. lovely people vocally liberal. taken covid pretty seriously. husband works home, wear masks, virtual learning son fall. BUT, let son come son's birthday party weekend piled 14 teens adults big limo masks rode around town night go walked around downtown without masks outside. 

SO.................................there perfect example liberals pro mask pro social distancing, came son getting go super cool limo party best friends, threw worries window suspended night son would miss out. 

So yeah, might hypocrites certain situations Nah think UK finally going 'win' something, PM giving us cash incentives go spread it. Sorry mean discounted eating month stimulate economy, result same. guess long run pensioners go get Covid die save money, money well spent /s. Italy use military remove corpses truck load? sure caught it? cause neurological damage maybe that's trouble comprehend wrote even when. going immediate disaster shown schools already opened. Children already died it, people saying issue would still alive healthy Birx pimping one page flowchart magical drive testing US going offer - Walmart testing Google coding R.I.P., Condolences Family Uh oh you’re painkillers. drinking heaps water. colleges universities opening (or planning open) like nothing wrong. seems kind him. hope helps need! US hiding deaths scale Iran, would 400,000 coronavirus deaths here, compared reported 150,000. government hiding 250,000 people dying coronavirus. work? get subreddit turned /r/politics everyone hates America here, little common sense would beneficial.

You conspiracy theorist think level deception possible democratic country freedom press. heartbreaking. Yeah sorry I'm sure make near much careers. likely make 6 figures taxes work weekends nights compared 9-5 job poor people die rich people get stuff. agree. much love hearing sports TV, sports isnt essential job. broadcast school classes instead. Canada please invade LOL? literally pandemic largely hits uneducated assholes society. Twitter asking years.

Also conservative politicians know hell they're long term plan. Herman Cain died day actually believed masks precautions unnecessary. doubt they'll put 2 2 together election time comes around. Yes risk

Covid literally leading cause death America right now. surprised went ""car accident"" comparison without mentioning like flu first.  That's usually order argument goes in.  Eventually end ""everybody dies, matter when.""  might well head now.  healthcare facility lacks protocols things mind-boggling. wonder make kitchen workers wash hands. source month old Q2 economic data available. received EU26 + UK 2Q2020 economic data last week week. Fauci part cdc. trust cdc either don’t live fantasy far right, hipster mom call ""terrible person"" recently fact thought School needed virtual right now, understand hard many families, disproportionately affects people modest means kids special needs, person class right exacerbate issue. onto something comment. think one reasons people distrustful media media always helped US government propoganda. Look Disney Hollywood WW2 Thomas Friedman NYTimes supporting invasion Iraq. wait sources come out. also wait see methodology used claims go there. methodology behind it? fake. Alot people take things face value days. Natural Law real thing. Pretty soon might see politicians dragged homes made examples of. mean, 400 million guns country. 

From historical perspective, look happened France years ago. day knew Birx ding dong - USA burn ground Birx tells labs make sure enough pipettes. March 15th 2020

So, hospitals laboratories: know pent-up demand this. Make sure every hospital every laboratory — I’m speaking — people work labs, like myself. Make sure enough pipette tips, pipettors, equipment need run Erm, go JCHS, schools online first semester. agree lots ppl aren’t taking seriously, school district taking seriously Well.... get sick - would go backyard tent. wife sick, could isolate master bedroom/bathroom, would still go tent backyard much possible. Would likely kids backyard camp also separate tent. that's plan. goal try make sure wife sick time possible. understanding math It’s entire working class tbh. fear whole time, hits family there's chance could one survive it. mom obese, dad borderline heavy smoker whole life, younger brother obese, oldest younger sister's borderline, youngest sister could well considered immunocompromised many health problems always having.

Worst part I'm one taking seriously all. Thankfully wear masks required, stuff open go like everything's back normal. mean, still leaves us substantial medical debt, refuse call insurance 🤣 student Indiana case first day. schools. Georgia 200 second day teacher planning even asymptomatics. I'm young healthy, I'm scuba diver though, dive world noticing real problems covid-recovered patients go back attempt dive usually would. People young, healthy, asymptomatic. massively concerns me. idea future going hold lot folks this. think possible lot people walking around damage know too. way works people strictly isolating anyway. Adding outside parties equation loosens strictness introduces lot possibility failure. understand people need able work even work home, thats still difficult kids around. flawed system guaranteed fail many instances based trusting parties control over. takes infected neighbor throwing ball back fence, friend dropping something someone careful groceries, deciding eating fine one time going bar friend ok, ad infinium.

With illness, seems silly known potential long term repercussions, seem like best choice. wish lived closer kid would adopt him. feel horrible him. US implemented lockdown ramped testing plan would look awful lot like Sweden. Far mask compliance, though. Lets honest, ain't gonna money none cost parents' funerals. Wow. cards stacked students financial aid. actually took leave absence parents lived overseas father diagnosed cancer. Doctors told six months live, figured stay home instead semester abroad junior year. actually lived another year half ended taking two years off. major case FOMO time even grateful additional time dad. went back college grades improved exponentially. Handled study-party balance better. appreciated educational opportunities much ever before. Still kept touch OG friends made many more. Landed amazing job graduation work experience years. all, taking gap years best decision I’ve ever made life. Yet nobody selling MLMs flat-earth shit actor.

Alex Jones, said plays character radio show, actor? source cited said lot impact around feelings around safety. Charlottesville ugly protest w/ dead bodies. Arguably impactfully $500 window damage. 

But pretend every riot exactly exactly impactful. ""intellectual"" equivalent comparing COVID flu. Police raid wrong house, kill someone sleeping bed, blame victim shut house party? Oh can't that. whole political machine bent taking pride ignorance.  voice loud US rather obviously it...

It's usually upvoted comment  don’t understand people refuse wear masks, stay home can, wash hands regularly,” celebration Wayne Lauri Rogers’ lives held 11 Tuesday Sunset Funeral Home Chapel Rev. Paul Edenfield officiating. family receive friends funeral home Tuesday 10-11 a.m.

Doesn't understand people stay home... hosts funeral... counterintuitive least. Yeah I'm glad school starts back mandating bunch stuff like masks one person gets sick everyone school kicked online. choice go person online. base educational opportunities everyone receives goes beyond, seem need anyone take further.

But shortchange education, create situations create opportunities disparities Think spending time spreading misinformation pandemic. also teaches Sooner later ‘Rona become endemic. good news coming miscarriages stillbirths rather premature live births. believe it’s truth, it’s lie, it’s mistake.

Amazing, you’re first person I’ve ever met whose never ever made mistake entire history lives. What’s secret, Mr Perfect? Think institutions one stupid US needs stop using “czar” title, sounds ridiculous. always picture someone dressed like Gaddafi fake medals all
over chest ranting charge (insert niche oversight role). Bad title using democracy....

(....and yea know, “democracy”) Last year (33) lost parents within 5 days (long story, it’s post history you’re curious).

It’s brutal thing I’ve ever get through. try think it, don’t realize many things remind you, over. Even typing emotional. 

I don’t wish body. 

I hope time, has/finds strength push makes parents proud. Building stadium

Yeah, put taxpayers hook that. sad hear, hope knows least one redditor sends love, stay strong every single country locked later opened experiencing surge cases. Look Spain, France, Netherlands, Japan examples. Lock downs make virus go away- delay tactic flatten curve, proven see numbers coming many countries starting struggle thing are. Yeah problem brewing long time. don’t know much ins outs NYC commercial real estate, know small business owners forced business landlords demanded exorbitant rent increases. would close bar / coffee shop / specialty store site would sit empty years. think landlords allowed write losses empty storefronts Duane Reade willing move in.

Obviously empty-storefront problem plague NYC decade without serious program fill real estate. basically saying Fuck far many people die heart disease because, ummm, covid special reason. 

You might want recalibrate moral compass. There’s Right way Safely split lanes. traffic either red light slow. Also ride like you’re invisible meaning dont assume cars see you. drilled get go learn ride properly. 

People estimate abilities without gear call squids. Squids bad mmkay Paywall: would greatly appreciate it! I'm Canada financially ok. I'm still worried funding run finding new job gonna tough always is. allow mail voting people absolutely risk lives polls vote believe in. depends state. Wisconsin use voucher pay private school comes right top local property taxes. Wait - Arkansas real? thought made scare people marrying sister/aunt 😝 Whats wrong people?!?! hard add damn column speadsheet says ""occupation""? important able sort deaths sex? Ridiculous. Sadly case may know years true numbers are. Gathering information fact much harder who's going quantify date?? Geez...can get grant money here, hire stats people figure out?? harm, healthier living? Gotta honest -- no, hadn't. remember ones south Bronx. mother 10

Damn lady. mean, like good cigar take while. impression taken great strides Pandemic preparedness clearly see *gestures broadly everything* that’s actually case reality. Telogen effluvium real response stress (good bad) lags behind stressor (such surgery, illness, pregnancy, emotional stress). worry excessive use disinfectants creating super-bugs. HEB runs tight ship. Everyone seen inside wearing masks, hand sanitizer plastic shields front end, separated entrances exits monitored employees. neighbor health inspector inspected several stores spotless. HEB 100,000 employees - would bet got sick community spread rather store. Wisconsin OK judge stepped took covid management authority away governor. cerebrovascular inflammation persisted infection March. Meningitis June. I'm finally better steroids starting physiotherapy, hope go back work soon.

34yo former fitness addict. better nate lever Beat you, need 5  sure do, designation, human capital stock. Nah don’t think want be, think people get confirmation bias feeding unwarranted pessimism. shit like makes want move USA. People would rather careless, listen conspiracy theories, willfully uninformed 90% current issues face them. USA. 

People think education teach shit- yet cases does. 

People selfish selfless. 

I FUCKING done place- get opportunity move, will. Ok clearly deranged. America lost cause Please take care read *all* comment replying. many examples direct actions give framework sending conflicting messages people listen him, directly contradicting actual medical experts, chose ignore?

We saw works countries. unified government response sync scientific medical advice saw great returns. opposite, choice made president, results were, similarly, opposite. 

You're honest. Jesus, post history shows still comparing covid flu.  Sidenote: Pier 1 filed bankruptcy shoot ~~themselves foot~~ everyone face covid clusters.

FTFY. familiar cold war? LPT: bring politics it, lose people. Stick facts. want make political points, let side say silly, partisan things. blood thinners take Tumeric fish oil work blood thinner supplements I've long time. Glad stopped falling out. Seems bit thin growing I'm hopeful time get back normal. CV19. gift keeps giving 😜 Governor responsible? Sorry man, I'm bad reading sarcasm text it’s coming must accurate. Things believe need achieve herd immunity strategic fashion. high-risk people paid stay home time young healthy galavant build herd immunity. young healthy person would love even sign catch controlled manner, battle prevent spreading somebody higher-risk later. Quick web lookup shows definitely Republican. I'm sure that's cause intense disappointment. podcast said conundrum. also based case homeless issue. bloodwork serious patients factor, rates fatalities people color, naturally lower levels Vitamin supporting arguments. There's two pictures. One lady there. next one shows ""crowd."" learned pandemic parents want daycare, want called school. think teachers going anywhere thing say homeless trned forced intermittent fasting (one meal day), could resulting autophagy could perhaps keep organs becoming rapidly damages higher amounts constant glycation higher food intake, problem simply Never get needed nutrients, cause havoc....

It would much interesting see effects one meal day covered RDA nutrients, unfortunately never happen. me, would picking floor. might feel way. However, also fucked tell people they're allowed something dangerous turn around thing tell allowed cause important. doubt fans going there.

The Jets, Giants, Raiders already announced ""no fans"" upcoming season teams offering refunds already-purchased single-game season tickets.

I imagine coming weeks teams get board, tipping point reached league shut fan attendance across board. I'm sure widespread amount grief associated community tragedy Katrina. However, try prove that, hurricane causal link increase substance abuse mental health problems without incorporating widespread influence social media, opioid epidemic, variety different socio-political/economic issues years following analysis disingenuous. methodology seems really lax. believe viruses potential cause form chronic fatigue. break doctor's opinion hcq?

In small sample, saw patients improve took hcq. parameters giving user hcq? ages user? sexes users? date(s) users administered hcq, hospital? 

This single doctor, administering thought best medicine patients, reported worked. We're looking research project, backed significant data tracking, reporting.

If hcq ""cure"" hcq, would worldwide run drug (it's generic), every corner Earth. praises *every* medical journal would hcq, would non-story. Instead: every major research, every medical journal showing hcq *doesn't* show significant benefit treating virus.

What we're seeing different doctor telling people bandages useful got cut, use them, everything turned fine.  time HD die business. millennials iPhones! Durrrrrr they're human beings, like are. think move place lack work needed sustain family place abundance work pays higher anything country given situation, lying yourself. take care people human beings thoughts emotions families, think appeal you. Consider, then, people come fill jobs here. opportunity. jobs fill rural agricultural work factory labor, lowest positions country. want save ""your"" job stolen immigrants, go college, get education, get college level job. then, deliver country's pit bosses, supermarket HR departments, lead farmhands silver tray work want do. plainest terms, they're slave labor. Willing slave labor, slave labor. rights supposed here, think they're villains? They're ones carrying lazy ass whenever eat literal metaphorical fruits labor. tolerance slavery capacity. people working country, citizens not, fundamental worker's rights protections. that, talk deporting ones here, might actually taking country they're giving. liberal family members beach vacations last months. Mask wearing performative. still belief can't happen me. 

I loss words regarding careless behaviors. sister in-law germaphobe planning cruises trips Nashville brother autoimmune disease. 

I know conservatives talk lot shit still masking really going anywhere all. 

It's much deeper politics believe. think comes understanding personal responsibility damn selfish. Even regular flu shots best 70% protection rate. seasons low 40% I. Coming Texas, new New Yorker, see summer precious time outside, Texans see summer literal hell earth, there's much incentive eat outside them. really thankful climate northeast! Testing Czar? czar? I'm curious, sure work, still running clinical trials country (Canada)? doubt listened Trump said. must merit behind it. mean situations? don’t know. certainly don’t value privacy like do, considering enter social security number creating online accounts. quite observed spies there.

Certainly allowed law, would European countries US.

Even completely non tracking tracing app much people already cry complete government observation, insane, that’s much shaming parents means 

I disagree. Look article beyond bold header ""Could pods spur new type white flight"". That's exactly doing.

Just count number times race privilege brought article, favorite ""privilege steroids"".

## u think could made money going business not? curious. booked Norwegian cruise later month cancelled back April! Whew!  Polio didn’t affect 70 percent population contracted another 25 percent symptoms equivalent flu, side effects percent bad society made priority rid disease. 

Dr. Fauci bone history past pandemics. ""Creating public health crisis"" seems like going bit far. think anyone actually established fringe people actually driving spread. Refusing cooperate stopping spread driving two completely different things. 


It's pretty convenient cop media blaming people want put masks, recently reopened bars, restaurants dozens indoor businesses COVID known easily spread. Even though believe comment kinda dumb lool also believe right say it. dont understand would deleted FUCK PEOPLE!!!

Just know, write this, everyone knows ignore you. sister-in-law teaches Cobb County start school. also single mom three kids. wife live Michigan gets sick wife going go take care kids quarantine. kids school teaches wear masks. Texas, state, can't. Legally. get terminated, lose pensions, health insurance. I’m going argue you’re selfish telling can’t see mother. agree disagree. Take care :) Like said. Unlike heart disease Covid spread. put masks prevent Covid, death toll would magnitudes worse cases. control heart disease proper diet. completely heart problems hereditary. everyone survives Covid completely fine afterwards. Quite suffer permanent lung damage rest life. Like said before, heart disease horrible. dad heart disease. heart attack survived. care Covid people like dad risk. suffers many genetic disorders. He's extreme risk. develop due ostracizing hospital Bill's etc lol Maybe different NYC, find completely annoying/absurd private business gets extend dining room block public sidewalk Man, really obvious me. I'm bad reading sarcasm text. bad everything open? Ocean City tourism could prosper. 

I imagine Tuesday, September 8th earliest we'll see Hogan anything even remotely sensible again... even then, seems revealed true colors (party country, one would expect). 

His prior good behavior March April fluke. Isn’t similar initial infection HIV flu like symptoms present 2 weeks infection. due cytokine storm? cases worse cytokine storm sx rapid outcomes HIV infection progress AIDS ever though maybe enjoys gives fulfillment? perfect without quirks? Thank you! Finally numbers compare. Austin canceled SXSW back March 🤦🏼‍♀️ doubt people would otherwise become infected, caught infection touching face wear mask. 

But CCP would made citizens wear masks so. Remember virus highly lethal, doses densely populated cities rises higher concentrations/titres, people ages begins suffer damages easily. 

I agree still avoid influence holes spread. compare fire spreading across 1000 hectares dry bush covered land, fire spreading across 1000 hectares dry bush cover lands cut 2000 hectares water filled canals, second fire spread easily. honestly wondering huge spreads places shown open hostility towards CCP like usa Brazil less spread places. guess big job governments right actually investigate intentional crime involved making places hard hit virus others. batshit crazy comes giving money businesses EVEN CHURCHES PAY TAXES, billions billions billions billions fucking dollars, politicians even bat eye. ask much write blank check. 

You ask politicians help PEOPLE supposed serving, they'll debate ages giving us handouts. Fucking christ. 

Get fucking boomers office. used want learn. around time turned 30 decided I’d rather keep bones inside. return something without actual something. Basically gimme money something bought I'm keeping thing. 

That lady real class act, good thing child teach kind class /s safety precautions same, that’s really main fact matters. guys better grateful US we’ll cut give back England course, perpetual blame game reddit. Everyone top blame virus spreading nothing protect employees/citizens/players/teachers/parents/customers etc. extremely transmissible virus, that's what's blame. people lives outside careers get know.

The NFL biz like biz skyrise downtown. declaration NFL schools gonna shut weeks naiive. almost bad Brazil Mexico poor United States right kill ~~makes stronger~~ screws long time lucky get back together again. reason assume worst case scenario highly touted vaccine  Yeah agree. feel like I'm sensationalist say two weeks, that's really see going. See CFIDS/ME, COVID-19 seems similar symptoms among many recover initial illness. surprisingly, CFIDS/ME initially thought somatoform disorder years 71 years old preexisting condition. 3 weeks deaths drop 5%? funny, didnt says bible giving appereance God sin? Thats christianity dont idols god reinfection serious concern would seen way cases due widespread prevalent virus is.

No wouldn't. serious concern there's enough immune response reinfection asymptomatic yet carrier still infectious. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah leftists real problem here, reality tv president I'm guessing employees sometimes negligent amongst other, feel safe wearing masks customers around, would bet dont wear properly team rooms. make reference mass amounts. floated idea herd immunity simple many people believe post. Sure right may hear mass amounts reinfection. Guess what? School starting month.

What kids bring home? Germs

Use ""logic"" mind meld way one, Vulcan. People like make want go spree Possible. think willing try appease, long stretch data fit. think can't stretch fit, tells truth. But, but...this worse flu! It’s overblown Demorats make Trump lose election! Yada yada... Lets party!’

They disgusting. That's true, N95 rated TB Measles article triggered lot Karen's.... TX shut yet?  articles talk that. He's not. people simply believe cause effect relates debt. believe point US recent history. problem US position US dollar power. power strong countries using it. US increasingly props stock market economy massive increases makes much less sense countries keep rocking boat. Literally none saying tracks.

The President spent months dodging support masks, reopen everything soon possible, open schools, though son's private school remote. also repeatedly claimed would go away. almost things helped contribute crisis.

One side protested closures wearing masks, continues wear masks, side tends flip do.

Your remark basis reality. constant complaining ""cabin fever"" first lockdown, think (Americans) willpower self-discipline handle another lockdown. that's considering deniers defy orders. 

We 1 chance right, fucked up. Duh intended. logic jumps front speeding car get killed, murder. mean still exists now- antibiotics it’s cured pretty easily. Maybe couple hundred years we’ll antivirals broad spectrum eliminate viruses easily think- wow, thing would’ve saved millions. English translation wrong. 

The actual link says vice-principle one particular high school suggested students jog 3 times day, approximately 30 min each. 

No ""requirement"", even implemented anywhere. 

If one report suggestion vice-principal high school United States, bet would get strange suggestions well. Always scares people take precautions still end getting sick. I’m taking extreme precautions feels almost hopeless. sorry young man. fed trying appease president realistically I'm absolutely fine continue life normal? Daycares much, much smaller smaller student counts general. 

Elementary school something like 800 kids 24-30 kids per class.

Daycare class sizes dictated state rules pupil/teacher ratio generally quite low (NJ 6:1).

Daycare class I'm usually dedicated shared restrooms two rooms. 

An elementary school (and higher) luxury; restrooms shared whole wings school.

Daycare serves lunch class kids eat class.

Elementary schools generally serve lunch open cafeterias potentially 100+ students once.

Daycare generally busing; parents drive kids school. Elementary school sizable district going busing involved kids sitting close proximity 30-45 minutes.

The smaller number pupils smaller facilities day cares also allow stringent controls. ones operating area (NJ) allowing parents all, require staff masked times, performing temp checks check-in. logistically easier dealing smaller student count smaller facility. still sent 4-year old back since pulling early March.

Let's also forget many facilities operating reduced capacity again, reduces ability virus spread present. point spread, point contain spread average, person infecting less 1 person.

People seem overlook lot spread among school age children -- would also infected general population -- *was contained cancelling school March*. we're going send 300, 400, 500, 800 kids buildings minimal cross ventilation, shared restrooms, shared facilities like cafeterias, going bad. going extra bad normal cold flu season kick in. 

Aside that, schools east coast west coast -- large population centers -- yet opened know happen coming months. NJ open another month. 10 million people county Los Angeles, ~8 states. **Just things look like catastrophe mean become one weeks**. Remember Trump thought virus going go away Easter?!? gambled thinking would non-event medical experts -- frankly anyone pay attention Europe -- knew going disappear.

Add fact we've seen poorly managed data is, could simply lot outbreaks tracked/reported publicly. already seeing coverup progress trying downplay counts positive results deaths. Still HIPPA works rant wrong man refuses accept this. I’ve heard anecdotal reports patients refused tests thought couldn’t catch twice. could easily radar.

We overwhelming number cases think seeing statistically significant number reinfection end year. weird shit going #s today. GA 2 deaths? Florida 1/2 amount new cases usual. Arizona 1/2 amount cases 14 deaths? Monday often low states avg dropped cliff today. We're ending education. would funding it. know think means less teachers school employees.

These institutions easily made serve community that, too, creates jobs employment. Reddit taught New Jersey Florida Northeast 😎 highest total cases total deaths. point. decided try prove wrong ignoring statistic favor another we're #1 in. No, cases deaths per capita, #8 cases per #10 deaths per M, extremely fucking bad exactly constructive towards initial point.

And look state lockdown EFFECTIVELY used way prepare reopening, get cases like New York, numbers stabilized quite bit despite high population/density. proof trying use population excuse (like trying do) fucking work. big, dense population (the state overall three times dense America's average) still get control provided smart it. New York smart it, rest country not. actually pretty confident reinfections/reactivations virus unaccounted for. logical. Mass amounts? No. That’s thinking outside box, thinking illogically. 72 NCAA? Division 3 even playing! sure source third is, know 90% school finding comes states.

The party time goes on, money teacher salaries, licenses. Pearson alone probably eating 50% budget. testing, technology, textbooks, lot money had. school typically pay double computer consumer would.

There reason profit charters move educate kids. I've seen lot people getting arrested/charged assault actually convicted yet? I'm curious see kind weight actually hold court hope harsh. There’s difference bunch stupid, stupid charge.

It’s one thing friend alcoholic. It’s another ask drive. can't get mask up, going get register? I've started wearing cloth mask 2 surgical masks that. Assholes walking around nose poking drives nuts. Meanwhile Fox news: everything going great! Case numbers going down! course broad. I'm using Thomas Friedman example NYTIMES allowing Friedman opinion pieces push country support invasion Iraq. form propoganda mainstream news outlet heard one before. Wow I'm speechless actually dareth refer glorious 100 euros note mere Monopoly bucks? Wtf wrong people?!?!? death rate Texas far lower New York plenty states even factor things allege factored in. started wearing one home now, dad got it, really think wearing mask within home. Thankfully, isolate due kitchen, bathroom, laundry. Exactly. Overall - yay! Still, nobody saying involved put future contacts risk.  

I'd love see comparison infection rate protesters non-protesters, given barely test nursing homes point that's probably stupid dream. Amen.  agree last part applies here. ""it's perfectly fine play circumstances"". players know better, successfully gaslit. protests hundreds thousands people gathering country? heard this. meet up? Honestly, spending almost 20 years living rural part suburb personal family issues flared Covid lockdown, I've realized would prefer city life live now. Much like you, live mesh kind lifestyle want.

Bigger houses bought cheap areas like this, encourage hoarding. Living 5 hoarders (of varying severity) struggle throw anything away space shit annoying hell. fair, slight hoarding tendencies I've working last months.

If kid like move rural area land that, expectation take even clearly one really wants property. kinda rolls parents grandparents pestering kids kids too.

Plus, far away seems enable generally unhealthy amounts isolation. lot food places deliver you, little interesting events area. honestly, bad could walk bus train buses come within walking distance me. want walk, maybe ride bike, use trains go everywhere.

Of course, everyone's experience country different, think case city person trapped country house. want healthcare congress gets. old Ipswich old Hampshire? Cause would funny. :) Ok like rant nothing specific conversation go tangents. Got it. Personal responsibility used inform personal decisions ethics. public policy.

While final duty falls individual, people cannot mind controlled, way find solution problem look external factors “well dumb”. Anyone done sort industrial safety know well.

For example: one person falls manhole, might fault. manholes filling bodies people fall them, something bigger play really seem like set failure. Couldn’t reality, enjoy antisocial!

No, think misunderstand. works people money pay bond dont sit jail. much likely show court. people dont money pay bond need jail, else hop gulfstream country extradition treaty. Rich = good, poor = bad. Make sense? idiot Conservative subreddit said US managing quite well 1) Italy worse death rate 2) far original estimate 2 million death. much wrong two statements, least poster told bad leftists... there's that. Thank you, safe too. Except COVID-19 lot permanent damage survivors flu. Instead 0.5% population CFIDS/ME 5% make sense think it. Maybe reinfection bad first time report it. possibly second time asymptomatic. anything people hush inside whole family group. Rather could related knowing. LOT macho guys go doctor unless death bed. sure ever single case accounted every edge case scenario?

You need think outside box. minor amount people able this. Yo lady way many kids understand science process. Yes, scientists said something yesterday contradicts say today. dumb ignorant corrupt. new knowledge result new behaviors.

I extremely perplexed something people don’t understand inherently know true. I’ve known true whole life. 

I’m high school dropout entire education public school Nevada, state consistently ranking bottom 5 education. remember clearly learning hundreds different topics lesson was, used this, learned this, instead. Basically every story, novel, project, something learn progress development. Even electives moving forward. learned wood shop something one way, later better way thing. 

The conclusion never someone, somewhere, wrong everyone except wrong forever. Sending preschooler this, would think, would damage keeping home time being.

I've already started writing loose curriculum fall. I'd rather get sick, endure described. husband Giants season tickets, already paid upcoming season. team told season ticket holders money forwarded next year. Make fifty game season give team random two weeks well-considered points. Thank responding. Thank you! safe too. rethink. Lockdowns this. Lockdowns panic move preparation, done keep hospitals intact medical system would 100% collapsed otherwise. Lack preparation (denial politics) this.  Lots people die every day things far worse (starvation, murder etc) I'm asking care particular area needs enforcement. Harris county (Houston) trending NYC direction.

Here's latest good news 7-day average deaths stopped aiming orbit. bad news take get daily death totals control. think so, unless live 5km Sounds like one.  Whoa, calm Jeff Bezos. people happy three emoji moneys. Gotta watch inflation. store properly dark place don’t interact often, last while. 100% relevant death rate sure. Although New York uniquely incompetent: age/health newly infected people matters too.

I talking rate new infections hospitalizations (which supposed flood hospitals trigger mass deaths). suggest deaths seeing aren’t sad obviously.

Note we’ve never, ever seen virus sustain *exponential* growth (like remember term high school physics calculus 1 - terrifyingly parabolic chart *accelerates* time). I’d see news roughly number (albeit high) new daily cases day day think “exponential growth means constant number now? aren’t even new cases infecting even people?”

Instead, we’ve seen numbers plateau and/or improve, perhaps (like academics suggest) we’re probably similarly susceptible. us pre-existing immunity fight virus quite well reasons I’m sure we’ll eventually nail down.

This might great implications things like the....brace wrongthink word....herd immunity threshold. Apparently optimism upsets people already made minds rapidly moving global phenomenon (literally “novel” coronavirus). minor bonus  coughing lady trash. cancer lady business going pier 1... florida. really expect Mother ten brain cancer? pier one? Whyyyyyy? Pretty crazy declaratively say I'm speculating even preface saying ""my guess"" Massachusetts understand people like make whole lives without getting finger jammed eye sockets. Massachusetts get america. want bail expensive rich afford it? like extra punitive people? guess least Phillies infected (yet). greedy narcissists. believe ringing gotten less.

You recruiter. Exactly. need see actual video people suffering, ventilators, hauled morgue. might wake us up. “Bring dead!” Money accepted...Devil owns... Line also local ferry, believe. sleep outside. worked SSA 30 years ago CFS becoming big deal. 

Previously drug addiction allowed disability could get benefits for. changed. tens thousands people getting drug addiction disability benefits claim different disability keep benefits.  CFS impossible prove either way, became disability choice claim.

The system flooded false claims CFS. people actually CFS. Judges doctors reviewed cases determined it. Doctors, lawyers, others drug addiction high paying jobs suddenly could get bed.

90% CFS claims false time. Drug addicts looking way get disability benefits, made seem like whole thing fraud. what's survival chance now? what's unemployment rate right now? many people facing evictions come September due federal assistance running out?

This sure worth virus likely kill you. *Mmmhmmm!* risk, already know exercise additional caution like would respiratory disease. cracked up.

Inflation consumer goods doesn’t happen poor people access higher amounts money, definitely don’t right now. biggest inflationary event happen last year 1200 stimulus maaaaybe additional unemployment benefit, offset deflationary pressure literally everything else going right now. Again, I’m talking real goods here, equities. Inflated equities don’t keep people eating. comes? Portugal peak new cases 20 40 days ago (not compared first wave peak, highest peak since then).

Where deaths?

&amp;#x200B;

Are old obese (or both) people staying indoor, meeting anybody? Could explain nearly everywhere seems ""second wave number cases, second wave number deaths""?

 think impatient college student waived tetnus shot. go seek sore arm immeditately?

Do medical file access. I've always found strange every time see doctor ask basic questions medical history probably access to, preferably digitally.... USA 20,159,378 infections 1,583,283 deaths COVID19. wanna shed light truth end political games. believe numbers! -- source = me

&amp;#x200B;

its issue BBC's credibility Iran's official data. BBC doesnt even disclose source, methodology, data breakdown. point, trusting based branding. believe prior statement made, apply scrutiny BBC saying too. also hits people often die flu illnesses. people die corona count covid deaths. stupid argument people die ""with corona"" tiny bit true. France likely 10% Germany maybe even 20% (8k counted compared 5k excess deaths).

You flu season kills thousand people still negative amount excess deaths. Top 2 causes death US Heart Disease Cancer. many burger-eating, cigarette-smoking, anti-mask wearing 'muricans time energy pay attention easily preventable diseases. tried find someone little smarter try explain word misued, pretty good explanation, even though fluff ""lifestyle"" piece.  Though interesting since article written way back 2018, even comprehend yet people would using term contexts outside relationships.  explains people misusing term even relationship context.  Little know reason personal relationship necessary component particular manipulation tactic something occurs time, intended shift power balance relationship.   way, example, keep one's spouse distant friends family, recognizing challenging wrongdoing partner. This. Lolwut

Everything I've said factual. exactly backpedaling? 🤣 Cases seem.to peaked starting downward trend deaths fall go rolling average. silly look numbers day day. Deaths going right probably rise little longer. cases starting go shows hopefully positives signs future deaths. God damn people beyond stupid, wow 😳 publications it, typically 1.5-2 ATA used saw. Oh one types. this. that. rattle numbers.

Heart disease cancer communicable like COVID. entire point many deaths could've prevented taking responsibility wearing mask significantly lower spread. now, addition dead dying cancer, heart disease, etc., 150,000+ dead. 

Heart disease largely personal issue. want go eat McDonald's? Go right fuck ahead. Like wheretogo_whattodo said, **you obviously ignored**, measures taken try raise awareness prevent heart disease. 

Cancer? Well shit, shitty luck exposure carcinogens. also laws lower/eliminate exposure carcinogens.

But man, wearing mask? THAT'S FEAR MONGERING UNCONSTITUTIONAL! 

And actually cared heart disease cancer, would know they're higher risk dying COVID. They're ones worried catching it, addition conditions. care. want sanctimonious shit. Also, grew (and still live here, thanks unemployment), wealth definitely equal intelligence. legit kid test negative COVID 19 count youngest COVID death Oregon people skeptical live. drowning man counted, several vehicle accidents handful elderly. numbers locally low, questionable cases fairly common cares? He’s black. /s Funny it’s perspective. I’m east coast thinking moving Chicago it’s much cheaper. sure winters far big cities worth it. unfortunately unique district. There's weird belief teachers work physically schools. incredibly demeaning. terrible state HVAC systems many public schools add risk. politicians horrific job pandemic remember names term comes vote out. Silja line used cruise ships normally going Finland instead gone Stockholm Visby summer. 
They traffic route Stockholm - Härnösand fall round trip cruises, routes go Åland tax free well. 
No major incidents Oh man, target audience reply 😂 think so? got heated debate wearing mask. many etc.. arguments convincing. Maybe they're useless know think best err side caution. wish scientists would really hammer home fact sure virus works therfore sure best tackle therefore take comes. Arguing pointless solid answers. Relationships ruined parents also old relatively susceptible, I'm 16. I'd rather die deal losing Birx Giroir seem breaking ranks. Coronavirus effort shambles fired good career move. pointless conversation. You’re looking someone hate you’ve chosen random seemingly innocent person. really don’t like people judge others baseless assumptions. Bye.

For someone concerned judgment, evaluate position here. seems though taking position people praised speaking known-denialist parents get sick popular, make hateful. CTE first clue? solution Congress fund everyone stay home three months unti starve out. That's solution. then, equivalent, we're going lurching one f\*d thing another, whether bars reopening schools, football, whatever. going continuous grind infection death get wise. every country has. Well, ship seems like perfect environment little spread... Lolz stupid humanity coming contact NOVEL virus attempting medically logical treatment methods established medical methodology gauge efficacy /s

Face -you literally don’t point. Nobody power *ever* sees power *fully* human. goes every walk life. country prevent cancer heart disease? Absolutely. time whataboutism? Absolutely not. Article pretty vague covid impacts people smoke worse don't. major factor confidence cloth masks seems grown. Cloth masks enough able social distance wearing them. Japan example that. much better mask usage yet lessen restrictions get increase. Cloth masks popular Japan. Sadly, proven way keep numbers low best isolate. Cloth masks enough speculative best. teacher one largest issues 3 kids. hard teach students 3 kids time. elementary age. Lol, haven’t bought milk like 10 years likely never again. 🤷‍♀️ used teach kindergarten. Dude, words describe fucking nasty kinder kids are. Like one kid 7th floor would get sick, entire kindergarten would sick within week. last year teaching, moved translation, basically sick entire year various outbreaks school. flu season hit, 2 5 teachers flu, substitutes got flu, parents sending kids school flu ""they anywhere else send them."" fucking bad school close closing parents refused keep kids home days.

I doubt shit going get fucked US schools really reopen coronavirus rampant now. Like yeah, we're reopening schools Korea, that's virus control. US not, opening schools basically going guarantee everyone directly indirectly involved schools going get it.

Considering Trump floating idea delaying election due coronavirus, would surprised reopening schools started attempt keep economy going, purposefully done worsen coronavirus outbreak order declare martial law something. kind wonder panicked take risks considering might foresee something way worse future manage overcome pandemic soon. POTS tricky diagnosis doctors really struggle asking right questions front!

I POTS I've never evaluated POTS enough symptoms screening routine wasn't.

I know health care system hostile diagnosing treating chronic issues. OK then, hell ridiculous search treatments?

People generally willing commute higher paying jobs WFH. someone working midtown NYC, there's every day. opened tourist info booths weekend added glass shields restocked brochures Lol never understand duals. worst road bike worst road bike. mean make ton sense me. Danish newspapers

Fyens national news source, local news source one smaller danish islands include ""comment section"" honestly care investigate actually comment section not. Politiken Fyens, would whole two newspapers, Ekstra Bladet makes ..three.

I never seen user comment anywhere Politiken, point article supposed people commnting newspaper's page various social media.

Twitter Facebook comment section. Ekstra Bladet offers reader possibility comment directly actual articles. 

I still waiting show news sources danish readers country comment directly article. surge eb.dk. 

So care Ekstra Bladet time know exactly many use it? Wow, BigBrains huh? general care eb.dk.

Yet commented recent news DR Facebook page 150 comments, commented recent news Ekstra Bladet 1430 comments. 

Mistaking wishful thinking reality character flaw. Did/do Obama, Gates, Kobe, LeBron, Kardashian, Teagan send kids 'regular' schools? Thanks clarifying disagree, though point nothing statement. sick people thinking outside get jail free card. amount crazy packed patios boat parties Minnesota insane. eating year, would honestly choose eat indoors patios stack people top indoor seating spread out. Idea: let's secretly start funding cruise companies offer ""free cruises"" get dumbest people continent. got fringe well deaths lagging infections 2 weeks, lot PA counties bottomed around 2 weeks ago slowly rising back again. think manipulation reporting, also think last. Psh, I’ve already developed opinion reply Oh, agree completely. might outdated last time checked ""immigrant-dense"" areas Stockholm way represented deaths per capita. fucking horrible. august going July without safety nets. going BRUTAL

The places allowing evictions proceed going create wave homeless men, women, children, completely unable socially distance accelerate spread. whole world it. Yeah yeah.... planning open schools Canada also. teachers, unions totally it.

Not parents happy schools opening soon. biggest crime planet witnessed. You...you realize heart disease cancer infectious diseases...right? hospitals overfilled sudden influx heart/cancer patients? Right? pandemic really hits real estates NYC, San Francisco Seattle pretty hard. percentage work become remote long term, benefit lot second tier cities states next them. Tax revenue CA, NY likely go quite bit well. I'm mad people I'm mad crappy government response. could spent summer coming solutions problems online learning, could guarantee basic income parents stay home easily kids, could've extended moratorium evictions, could politicized masks, etc...As country still many options yet exercise none them. 

In spite inherent unfairness can't even get mad people choice. Sweden good example do, amount mental gymnastics people make good outcome impressive sad.  hes next count recoveries can't calculate current cases spiraled control way riots. Time try unionize again. Well least democrats elected someone wanted everyone free point access healthcare help clean mess up. 

God damnit. two different discussions. stated difficulties family experienced, referenced OP, somehow uniquely American. Discussing US response corona economic hardships experienced pandemic much different topics. parents caught week could think pulled thought extremely lucky outcome. Seeing really hurts man, wish best, can’t even fathom pain he’s going rn. think late save USA economy. USA suddebly gonna start able handle covid. 

There good chance 2020 becomes historic year USA lost position world rich powerfull country. Yup, 100% planning this. Andrew yang novel proposal sunset laws. would force laws review see even work.

I.e. implement wall 2 year sunset. said law known affect trying correct. law allowed **expire** try different approach tweak law make better possibly desired affect. It’s lame keep downvoting comments reply dude symptoms, moved kids one room, got extra bedroom thier bathroom. lived room waiting test result (positive) stayed got negative test symptoms gone. wife kids never tested positive. I'm assuming got really lucky, asymptomatic got quickly. hes actually modest I'm assuming basing prolonged exposure likely guess magic 15 minutes means much likely case gotten I'm pretty sure talking directly within 6 feet, would take moments conversation. 

I boggled read company follows protocols are. know American schools start early, August started That's rich renters preferring buy instead. demand rentals goes down, demand houses goes up. keep virus out.

Any time theres grouping people different households, risking exposure. talking long duration likely maskless day times day, thats even higher risk.

These pods end poor experiment wealthy folks sympathy pursuing it. can't wealth way safety pandemic pursuing risky behaviors. Great point. Could lost translation seemed like saying weren’t giving guidance mask usage science isn’t clear.

Totally anecdotal friend got back Taiwan, country lowest infection death rates. There’s ambiguity mask usage. I’ve heard people saying especially Gummi-bear Twitter it’s based statistical analysis rather science. Also fact Louisiana experiencing second wave doesn’t bode well. teacher district decided physically open school up, would immediately quit take one gigs. 

One huge benefits forced teach specific type educational requirement. There’s lot creativity flexibility type environment, teachers better chance actually getting Covid. High School (and college) lot classes don’t teach. Personal finance, medical education, mental health education name few. instead get cells leaf languages learn Rosetta Stone. Academia scam. Oh gets better! *really* cool people raised fuss that. also producing masks here.

That awesome. Every country figure generally. nice hear countries get right!  Mmmmrrrrrrmmn Mmrrrrrrrrr! (Aaron Burr!) Market Basket, I've never seen milk short supply. never canceled heart doubt make much money fines pay.. know 120k number US 50k excess deaths top confirmed Covid deaths July 18:

""Nationwide, 190,600 people died usual March 15 July 18, according C.D.C. estimates, adjust current death records account typical reporting lags. number 50,000 higher official count coronavirus deaths period. Higher-than-normal death rates widespread across country; Alaska, Hawaii Maine show numbers look similar recent head shady moves going numbers sent gdc(?) something, test that's used thousands counted. No, idea.
Honestly idea bad truely heard someone talk 35% positive tests. Cases rise Netherlands we're starting get concerned ~1% positive testing rate. cycle repeat second another person diagnosed Covid. shortsighted 'plan'. seriously need plaster videos inside covid wards news. Blur faces, show suffering. Make sure people know horrible really is. Praying family. Chernobyl Russia. Actively campaigning public health emergency. existent *thing* all. taking time type care thinks really proves that. Compassion fatigue set soon, especially schools reopen like virus there. early ones, like teenager here, receive bounty generosity situations children orphaned due parents dying Covid19 become common, latter ones receive pittance.

I support teachers strike. conservative politicians small band insane followers go fuck die. Well I’m pretty sure thread people who’s classes entirely online, there’s that.

If classes online yeah makes sense tell me, person worn half respirator full beesuit face shield 90 degree heat demolition, worn surgical mask PPE volunteering greenhouse like tent 103 degree weather, six hour infusion appointment today half respirator vent masked including nap meds make groggy really isn’t hard wear one sitting quietly cool indoor room. Oh also hearing aids glasses on. Sorry peeps, gotta deal discomfort sometimes life, glad mild. adopts. They've open months 7 day average deaths per day 6. That's South Korea Europe did. worked. 

The rest United States needs follow suit. Additionally, state health departments given authority fine shut businesses comply public safety. TN, dont really watch sports unless friend's house; knew people buy literally every single piece merch find overused orange ""t"" previlege

Americans need start really considering (a) whether want remain country; (b) choice, start throwing lazy politicians refuse give health departments real teeth enforce laws; (c) putting actual pressure current lazy politicians take us costly wars. $40, according story. Holy moly, misogyny showing. 😱 Just. Wow.  question goes echo chamber subreddit. Another commenter pointed people ask questions actually trying make point. It’s sub one big circle jerk say something sub doesn’t like gets downvoted oblivion. I'd like learn this.

 Thanks Prolly thought bout pull one ol best buy. Wishful thinking gramps Ma'am* Got conspiracy theories wanna throw thread? Yawn. I'm thinking. protests marching open streets going home. 2 week gathering means there's going lot indoor hanging “Other elements also familiar. Results small studies overblown.

Good thing one recording eh? people really like go yell people take anger dumb realize actions consequences dream open store actually sell anything. like amazing, awesome place, coolest stuff could ever want everything priced $1, tiny print stating ""item actually sale location"" every single item.

Amazing video games, rare records, first edition books, great pizza, beer, actually sale. Maybe even arcade games spit every coin put automatically without letting people play. (They take special tokens thousands ever sell give anybody).

We'd lots furniture would also sale behind counter every day could ""go work"" would actually hanging playing cool stuff nobody else use.

We'd whole room ""complaint department"" really long, slow moving walkway takes people around secret hallway perimeter building big loop like lazy river. Arrows signs point ""complaint department"" moving walkway would obviously never reach.

so obese - heres answer many countries, odds catching well 1%.
So infection mostly due chance, due behavior, well 1:10000, perhaps 1:100000 accounting certain time immunity, one ten would recognized due limited testing sometimes unrecognizable symptoms, would negligible amount patients. even counting people tend hold antibodies longer months.

One hope catch usually much, much higher chance due behavior, otherwise, many detected reinfections all, even people lose immunity three months. agree, politicizing pandemic extremely detrimental population knows, perhaps people power wanted truly care.

If many seemingly brainwashed people, perhaps could unite together fight back.

For real even half results coming yet like said time get said results probably infecected lot people.

The resources put towards supporting people enforced lock appropriate amount time.
At rate, least outside world, US completely unapproachable uninhabitable look underrepresented statistics, practices government actions surprising amount citizens completely disregard severity virus. country made masks law around first May. 5 weeks that, hard lockdown enforced military basically nobody leaving house.

Now, we're 200 400k nobody laughs anymore...

During week, shops filled masks, Dansk Industri estimates.

Lots masks way Denmark. emphasized Lars Frelle-Petersen, member director Danish Industry, contact several companies import masks. Masks become highly sought (danish) National Board Health Friday issued recommendation wear public transport rush hour.
If, example, hope get one website webapoteket.dk, disappointed. already sold out. Several physical pharmacies reported thing recent days. time, huge demand meant prices popular masks risen markedly past month. shows analysis PriceRunner tracks prices products various retailers.

But within days, fresh supplies arrive Denmark, says Lars Frelle-Petersen Danish Industry. 

The importers masks, especially China, placed orders Friday weekend, contact them.

- Thus, expect week able lot masks country, also able come shops, ordinary Dane able get hold them, says.

**Everyone get mask** 
The Danish Pharmacists' Association also believes enough masks everyone. - pharmacies receive new deliveries every day, wholesalers placed extra large orders bandages suppliers. 

They confident comes keeping current demand, said Jeanette Juul Rasmussen, vice president Danish Pharmacists' Association, Sunday Ekstra Bladet. Monday Tuesday, however, may still shortage masks certain shops, assesses Lars Frelle-Petersen.

- definitely think week see lot stores masks, wholesalers got home able deliver stores. Danish suppliers also attentive delivering market home, states. National Board Health recommends wearing mask public transport possible keep recommended distance least one meter. think so? regular flu isn’t transmissible COVID19 social distancing everyone practicing well enhanced hygiene, think it’s unlikely particularly strong flu season year. 20%... include kids. say... 24%. consider people actually can't get vaccines various legitimate reasons; let's say 1%. 75% people get vaccinated.

Now remember need 60-70% population get herd immunity. 

That sounds great, slack... vaccine 100% effective. be. 75% scenario, vaccine needs 80% 93% effective. keep mind read news results ongoing trials vaccines.

Here's article topic curious: experiments revealed prevent epidemic (reduce peak vaccine efficacy least 60% vaccination coverage 100% (reproduction number [R0]=2.5–3.5). vaccine efficacy threshold rises 70% coverage drops 75% 80% coverage drops 60% R0 2.5, rising 80% coverage drops 75% R0 3.5. extinguish ongoing epidemic, vaccine efficacy least 60% coverage 100% least 80% coverage drops 75% reduce peak 85%–86%, 61%–62%, 32% vaccination occurs 5%, 15%, 30% population already exposed COVID-19 coronavirus. vaccine efficacy 60% 80% could still obviate need measures certain circumstances much higher, cases, potentially unachievable, vaccination study found vaccine efficacy least 70% prevent epidemic least 80% largely extinguish epidemic without measures (e.g., social distancing). Ignoring atrocities corporations big part culture. Like people collect Nike shoes Apple fanboys kpop stans. Millions.  LoL. Hope worth it... said make rely official data feel better.

This comment aged well:

[Florida breaks weekly coronavirus death toll record 1,000 reported reports record number COVID-19 trying get downvoted. Literally. transmission section bad luck needles. last time got round vaccines, administered RN easily 70s shaky hands. One shots one go deep next bone, unsheathes fucking dagger hypodermic ice-picks straight arm shaky old lady hands. even give second warm anything.

I also can't get blood drawn without something awful happening. apparently thick numerous nerves less three occasions I've nerve damage simple blood test hit nerve clusters. bad limited mobility right arm two weeks afterwards. routine blood draw could barely drive home easily shift gears car. bet supplements industry roof well. know I’ve added four different ones daily myself, whereas Covid appeared took none.

Anyone else? Go read top comment thread. Florida counts positive tests once, negative tests multiple times.

This makes positivity rate look better is. It’s another damn group project.

You know, undergrad used seek Asian students group work with, got it. IME didn’t even matter proficient English, work ethic understanding community, willing take time help conversational English interpret intent. guess that’s Asia well battle suck much. seek minimize work pass blame things go wrong west.

I add put tremendous amount effort group projects, probably spent time part helping classmates edit parts, way less frustrating working Americans.

I really talk wife moving Japan Korea, even Taiwan, job wouldn’t carry over, she’d make far less, think we’d fit better there. dragons November soon, January February real possibility.

Our schools closed January 29th. vaccine given teachers could start returning normal February 1st . CDC claimed safe go back school fall? need context quote One?!?!?!?!?! r/enlightenedcentrism  wish Trump would golf even more. damage he's golf course --- could help country spent less time ""governing."" trials far along good news far, hard part making vaccine initial effect. hard part making vaccine safe actually lasts long enough practical.

We never expected would hard make vaccine works. problem long guarantee immunity course safe long term.  might sound like dumb question idea long take everything get back normal? Exactly. level scientific knowledge among general public. Countries good STEM education tends young people behave properly pandemic. ""The death one tragedy, death millions statistic"" *could 😉 Read WTHI. You’ll want ducking go mad. entire nation lock great idea, lot states already refused lock cried hair cuts. Americans spoiled entitled, lot. I’m American agree Reddit’s hate America. ironic people die COVID related issues (needing ICU capacity availability dying different emergency), Sept 11 2020 died Sept 11 2001? Reality check. arent ones made political. six months plan prepare Bogans versus sensible folk. aware Canada part United States America right? comments far suggest otherwise. keep saying ""your"" government I'm US.

Just clear: America = United States. North America = Canada + United States. People Norway good, assume gotten less careful well. week already looking like numbers trending upwards (doubled 20 infected per day). Last month wedding incident someone 100 guests so. still trying track last 50 guests. SMH.  nothing loose chains. medical facts plucked imagination land Work issue seem like anyone referring to. literally died three days ago... wrote reddit bot specifically seek let know wrong creator would you’d wore mask public Everone says that, one doctor Wasnt US president said ""Hungry People without job stuff dictatorships made of.""? Well keep talking 99% survival rate that’ll 3 million total deaths start bothering USA Lol one postman office pissed one customers moaning went around pissed pond. homeowner saw knocked out. Following dumb argument start anyways die flu without underlying medical issues well. rare happens every year. People 18 longer need wear masks social distance Netherlands... mean technically statement true. People forced go back work work = starve. brought virus workplace infecting it. 

People literaly paid spread it. Yup. travel 3 counties state, job found travel quarantine 3 weeks. shitty response, says lot you. [Books mention hope, Well extraordinary place already politics.

11,000 people going die every week month president GOP politicised pandemic failure leadership, 150,000 people dead. medical condition exempts wearing mask. Halitosis real disease, unlike Coronavirus. Many people told bad breath, I’m trying smell that! /s Thanks help, citizens Good  Politics aside, really thought I’d hear lot mail carriers infected. really call us that? That’s awesome 😆 Tshirts? oh irony :( WELL SEE, 9/11 DONE ARABS ETHNIC GROUP!!! DARE THEY! Rich Losers lmao that’s call it! remember seeing “dicknose” somewhere can’t remember DeathSentence

As Floridian, laughed. ignorant bassackwards asshat going kill us all. :( No, close God hope so. Keeping diseased Americans Canada silver living, they’re already lying sneaking Canada spread Trunp virus. Build wall. Yuge growth across board United States. It’s tremendous phenomenal, nobodies ever seen anything like history US. say it’s enough growth though, need Except applicable Saturday even worse, Sunday (when article posted subreddit). 

At least numbers Florida's DoH posting. virus affected lots families doubt. However death statistics many countries including US way off. assume anyone covid/ covid synptoms dies, died result virus. fantasy misleading. Professionals government need transparent. 

This example seeing death ischaemic heart disease abnormal lows year.... could ever keep up, 1200 per day, it’d take week cover day’s worth. Trump must like: 1 death tragedy. 1 million statistic. question might sound stupid, idea situation becomes normal? mean, hearing news vaccine every day people say wait till 2021, saying mid-2021. true cases traced protests, proof assembling outdoors safe. Even without masks. all, many people protesting without masks. considering widespread virus time, almost certain even one photo posted, likely someone without mask pictured C-19 time. Re-iterate situation hundreds times across time place, still haven’t traced cases protests, almost certain assembling outside safe. percent people 65 underlying health condition.

Let's quick maths. actually really struggling find death breakdown age Florida alone, I'm going use USA numbers whole, use 84% Florida stat get rough picture bad is. I'm aware Florida could skewing information one way other, best information have.

US: 4813972 cases; 158372 deaths. CFR always higher IFR, gives us 3.28% fatality.

Now, data age find 20/07, lists total 130245 deaths. Still, work analysis.

So, 130245 deaths, 26,018 age sixty five. So, 20%. Now, 84% 26018 underlying health problems, gives us 41622 people underlying issues. Perfectly healthy.

Out 130245, gives us 3% relatively healthy died.

Out 4813972, thats 0.08% (you're probably looking like 0.15% due difference cases).

So, 65, relatively healthy, still got 1 10,000 chance surviving disease.

Just thought i'd put things perspective people panic girlfriend toronto too, seen 7 months, miss lot!  Great, rate safely re-open schools bars year. Thought same. Interesting steadily climb 180ish 250s couple weeks, plummet 160s Saturday 62 Sunday. weekend numbers fall short places report weekdays. across week monday tuesday seem higher weekend seems lower. That's use rolling average.    *canned reddit response # 963* fuck wrong add button sidebar filter US posts? /r/InclusiveOr/ actual sub want though. Agreed, fact overheard people talking eating outside social gathering good, would less people competing good jobs salaries would need go higher recruit retain interested. stay U.S. thanks Stupid mods takes obvious truths, like chemical pollutants bad rich pedophiles rule majority planet, appeals people's xenophobia explain elaborate. mainstream media cannot explain things, complicit lapdogs things. People need understand feel something feel safe, think many anti-mask? hoax, danger. I'm Republican.
I believe 'sides' full idiots take every little opportunity - even completely context - make insane 'because side bad' statement.

Oh look well!! LOL

Its bordering insane point.
You back horse race see ones lame, case them. Results rule changes and/or masks big states (TX, CA, AZ). see, know fact real unlike I’m educated, know people who’ve it, I’ve friends family medicine working treatments research I’m fucking moron nose trumps ass. relevant success bubble? sure downvoted. idea taller people risk relates airborne transmission may encounter different levels virus. Altitude completely different variable related potential adaptations body people chronically exposed lower oxygen levels, different levels UV light, changes atmospheric pressure. scary think covid people know epidemiologist did... shows level basic education US abysmal... Alberta decided report weekend numbers; stupid.

at least one technical type issue. died out, course. still present infectious waning immunity problem mutate rapidly. snoop's 50 seem lost track original statement. remind you, since scrolling back seeming athlete group smart...

Nobody said athletes idiots, said pro athletes, take group, smart. world difference smart, idiot. also specifically narrowed assessment *professional* athletes, *all* athletes, incorrectly accused.

I entirely agree comment, entirely disagree, also reacting said, rather fictional, exaggerated version. ridiculous prediction Can't wait schools open back /s  makes hopeful city Melbourne missed all, irrelevant considering amount mass gatherings blatant refusal comply safety guidelines Americans regards virus.

What I'm saying is, testing process basically worthless far in.

America praying vaccine save people stage.

Oh anti-vaxxers sitting fuck yet or? didn’t say rapid test kits tho. That's scary hear.... long take make vaccine people influenza outbreak around 1920s? incidentally put Taco Bell next BK house. freaking love Taco Bell. I’ve easily dropped half stack since quarantine started lol.

There many things way dealt care homes scandalous. People saying large numbers March, too. going ""the numbers fake, they're reporting everything Covid"". always forget voting obligatory US. That’s weird Lol, elon fine. bailouts? think get locked rooms hits. internet shit boats. fun. Good response.

I'm looking torture anything, snarkiness comment admit, merit arguments still there. public discourse important, telling people make minds avoiding discussion actively harmful. Username checks out. Thank details - Risch's Newsweek item wondering. federal government cant take advantage something dont operate. US healthcare system overwhelming private industry (providers, clinics, meds, payment, supplies). 

The feds could supplement industry (using war production act manufacture PPE), taking laid physicians/providers redeploy government providers (matching previous pay). course, would require competent leadership executive legislative branches (blame Trump, Senate, House (yes Dems, fault too)).

I agree nurses, physicians, providers put overly stressful hazardous conditions; not. example, big backlash CDC tried loosen PPE requires (saying surgical masks appropriate alternative n95 respirator), hospitals (mostly private) could compel providers continue work. sure stop paying them? Fucking morons forget Tom Hanks Fred Rogers. 1000% appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Wikipedia says pro-pedophilia advocacy group...North American Man/Boy Love Association.

Aight then. Memorial Day weekend seems like hit [testing Reality complicated though - states continuing increase tests/day numbers offset states testing less expected (like Florida).

On international front, surprising US [ranks testing per capita. still enough size problem though. changes would like see implemented remedy issue? dual citizen deep sympathy struggles common citizen States. don’t mean come rude. What’s definition soft lockdown? Gällivare closed libraries, indoor pools, indoor sport facilities museums. public transportation didn’t go way city center weekend. soft lockdown? needed get supply FFP2 &amp; 3 masks NHS &amp; didn’t want people hoard/price gouge.

If everyone wears mask spread decreased: reason mandatory indoor lot countries. keep saying news stations take hour everyday list names victims share bit lives family. weird. many states drunk public throw tank Vegas help find room. came say LOL feel country handling whole thing? quite well, (Queensland), Victoria different story though. 423 cases recorded today... think Australians done bad - could better definitely could worse... concerned elderly population though. I'm rural area too, amazing see going countries continuing almost normal. People mostly good social distancing, masks rare (mostly handful elderly people) school activities resumed. couple cases region early travellers went straight isolation. really hope stays area. think liver handle another lot homsechooling! thinking people may resort sharing photos literally documenting health declining death. would still believe tragedy living real time. I'm rewatching Containment gf. occurred today every single person inside 1 square mile cordon died...that'd US COVID death toll 3 days right now. Lol. Poland context. Recently, found one dollar desk (don't remember getting anyone) looked back exact phrase (in God trust) damn illuminati triangles made think kids currency, real dollar. googled and... Well wtf. Even extremely religious country, kings portraits bills. Imagine know tomorrow Well smart it, lucky, could looking $320 end year.

Bet $20 useful everyone loses job millions become homeless. That’s roughly 1500 deaths per day equivalently 4 jumbo jet airliners crashing every day. people visit 'covid19postive "" subreddit stories make want take seriously Company - though depends structured. 500 people paid corporation/LLC/whatever. [Well That’s stage ratio takes over. you’re scared anymore know protect loved ones. Better safe sorry. I’d hate ending hospital bed knowing it’s stupidity got there. Stupid question, kids need someone watch them?

I'm germany remembering back always came back school empty house. parents working times would see weekends. 

It friends. Obviously can’t &lt;8 year olds, though think mostly alone home starting age 8+?

Nothing really happened. guess ""good"" early parenting prevented problems. regular citizen bought masks back January.

A lack medical masks hardly issue. getting everyone comply reasonable sort nose/mouth covering getting stay home (with financial emotional toll comes it). take seriously anyway. need torture this. 

And, support it, it. simple. Didn’t AstaZeneca promise produce 2 billion doses end 2020? us road away home everyday, they're kind eat. 500 employees location whole company? kids start dying large numbers think sink in. looks like poor specimen human

Wow. Imagine saying fellow human being. realise surgeons wear masks spray spit (while talking/breathing) open wounds they're operating on, right? nothing protection viruses. I'll never understand need people eat restaurants. idea got way. beginning thought we'd 50k dead year. 300K? think that's amount Americans died WWII. Covid air. legislation stuck behind senate game playing submitting even proposal time almost out. Neither preclude wearing mask though. football game tho fucking awesome US capitalism™ ""manages"" pandemic.

Just great awesome! Company gives loan high risk borrower. Borrower defaults. Company files lawsuit collect. Where's problem here? everyone. cry watching David MuirABC news every day. need see someone die feel sadness it. love fellow man ib sad fukked skinny person, feels good man. hate fat people. assumed PHE pausing daily figures would mean Worldometers etc. would longer get updates them. I'm surprised that's still happening.

I heard news getting PHE method corrected surprising. Lol kid admires trump wishes talks like him. loser Yeah, people get I’m hurt cells makes immune increase antibody production encounter something seen before. Antibodies dissapate infection easily produced again. sure fear mongering known diseases. question, statistics number deaths US, 2020, compared 2019? Would interesting read definitely something used silence ""deniers"". lock downs, better others. Oh no, doom gloomers ruling sub lives over?? good point. would smart move, least picking southern vp arrange quit once. argument make people take shit seriously can't use statistics.

This basic psychology, support it, would pretty fucking well Teachers don’t get social security - pension based years service age. COVFEFE-19 full steam ahead thanks idiots politicizing pandemic extremely selfish. waste time energy teaching things reasonable responsible citizen know pandemic.

Just think would acted like gave shit people around us, instead angry inconvenienced. matter time parents, children, friends, parents children friends someone else. Unless trajectory new infections changes drastically, wake apathy soon enough.  Back day, common sense thing. amazed managed survive however long dumb are. Heartbreaking deaths - specially 4 year old girl losing mother covid. can't even imagine must mother dead alone 12 hours. Holy shit, hope has/gets good support system finds peace. U.S. always cancer, experiencing one symptoms Trump mean crux issue.

He culmination everything fucked U.S. 

Our entire society built elites, shown child made government. right gaslit believing wealth = everything society sought Democrats failed them.

The cancer capitalism, bought government damn near beginning. time saw mass improvement challenged extent FDR. many issues him, represent people unlike rest.

Biden test whether people want treat symptoms actually seek cure shit. test, fixing anything besides tending metaphorical wound government gave up. They're real ones blame.

Heck, believe recent reports, part intentional strategy fuck over, part, Hispanic areas. reddit, disagree manstrean narrative, attacked. everyone talk real life (even random people come across) feel way do. Kindnof odd reddit place people attack thinking common sense also exact symptoms exactly time agree experience taste smell loss quite unlike ""ordinary cold"" allergy.

Nose totally, 100% clear. bit congestion. even slightest sniffle, blocked sinuses anything.

But could've squirted aftershave smelled thing. Food taste anything--it like eating cardboard mush couple weeks. Also little feverish, fatigued, bit tickly cough, otherwise well.

So yeah. worth, I'm pretty sure it, sounds like too. damned sense taste smell thing (again, even reported symptom) unusual coincidence. death rate rising? now? False exactly lie? shit huh? Back 100% correct limit masks medical personnel. Back one could foreseen anti mask movement. retrospect may mistake, way foresee would happen. assuming sample distribution pseudo-random, naturally lot testing sites closing even less random.

It's still good sign, least high. Looks like year two I'll back biggest problem handling rejecting bars. Yea. friend going sva back March said sirens 24/7. denying death rate rising? rising consistently since made comment? think going magically stop rising? Fool, war fighting enemy. immune systems probably weaker past people exposed pathogens back then. Disinfectants really thing common use, neither refrigeration clean water guaranteed.  always cop mild fever day vaccine. Figure it’s good sign, means immune system responding. know, COVID United States... countries know. mean, *was* told back March horrified. Bruh, even utter figure 113%, anti-maskers scream ""HOAX! kill 100% country?!""

We dealing complete idiots here. actually used Korea. silence isn’t beeping, still vibrates. get messages day alerting new cases confirm wasn’t area. tens daily cases, thousands. Testing plateau could explain numbers stable, slowing down. Good. know two people died, 50s, one healthy one type 2 diabetes. Gone time. always followed rules, first person died watching quickly went really woke horrendous, cruel unpredictable is. 10% death rate now? case point similar north korea .50 AE one's head best alternative everyone high alert mode week two would  reason compliance high federal state legislators made mandatory. Rest assured, plenty people resisted probably many never would worn one wasn’t reinforced fines jail time (which was). Well, makes sense he's trying actually much damage possible. Cause fake? Common sense kicked now? worry though vaccine fix China's cover accident China worsened covering up, even done deliberately?

Dude, still bought lies hook, line sinker you? matter party - complicit lying you. 

**US intelligence informed Trump early November**, outbreak even happened China. also alert Israel NATO November**. Funny aware outbreak happen yet. South Korea U.S received first confirmed cases week**. Look two countries doing.

But seen lot people pushing #ItalyLiedPeopleDied, #FranceLiedPeopleDied, No, course not. that's science works. 

""Needing time investigate"" ""covering dangerous virus"".

Coronavirus didn't, system held together gum sticks designed benefit billionaires robust promised us, surprising. good estimate, averaging number today previous highs, multiplied number days left.

This say sure change future, current trends think estimate excellent. Policy decisions determine numbers go amd whether changes linear exponential... Considering sub we're in, I'm pretty sure preaching choir. Last checked, though, medical legal authority randomly go stabbing people vaccine. Much I'd like to. Looks like they’re russia October. works well might same. Production many vaccines well way. CDC evangelical fanatic director said he'd send grandkids school? far. Prediction occurrence. That's stupids laughing CDC claiming overblown numbers. sounds low.  saw estimate US would 800k end year. surprise here, he'll first endorse improperly tested rushed vaccinations masses. Imagine crowd locker room scored last minute TD Pederson firing up, screaming yelling faces way coaches do. Guys huddled up, arms around other, etc

It’s suspension logic think fine. Sadly, intelligent American realize know absolutely nothing pandemic. I, one, longer trust anything media words politicians, know whatever protect loved ones stay afloat financially.

I really think repercussions entire ordeal massive sweeping years come people either see care. TCM varies certain degrees cause remember Mercury considered immortal tonic led gunpoweder... go FIGURE   fake/ inside jobs.
And ain't nobody dying c19.
Nice try ""fauchi friends"" f u bill Nobody cares anymore everyone 'knows somebody know somebody whose death ruled covd19 death despite completely unrelated' mean 9/11 victims obese underlying medical conditions, America would gone war Bin Laden. one cautiously optimistic ones 'maybe bad seems...' Naive maybe.

At first kind true, continued say horrible things effect country devastating, intentional mishandling pandemic honestly worst thing he's done presidency imo, bar pretty high.

But yes, America absolutely bad, much worse. ' PHE pausing daily figures'

They still post dashboard presume international comparison sites get from.

'I heard news getting PHE method corrected surprising.'

They taking sweet time, 2-3 weeks now. Defunded mean defunct. means scaled back. Dude... need say something someone.  situation? pandemic? Sounds like affair. Insurance absolute devil...and fun way.

I’m angry-just disappointed. Nah, like:

Fixed it. Imho Orwellians neccessary authoritarian things organizations twisting words bend shape perceptions population wills, gains, also happens seemingly democracy societies, too. Religous organizations probably state-of-the-art system kinds stuffs, mastering since societies started form. seem Orwells Vision here, mate. Yes please! FlU Yes. I'm putting money Trump University vaccine personally.  That’s intense conditioning. bunch BULLSHIT!!! Till day one know ever caught died it. POTUS loses magically go away!!!!

So, yeah. understand people moronic insane excuse country constantly talk failures excuse president. Deal it, goof.

The naked truth -- standpoint population members, empires deserved economic collapse US likely undergo next couple years. Yeah, never fan Hillary damn choices fucking awful. thought landslide bc Trump bully uneducated buffoon. damn lost hard. remember crying night thinking much going go wrong. 

Never thought would get bad mean America ever bad? Seriously asking. Wow, bar incivility really low sub. reporting know read point doesnt matter. 

&amp;nbsp; 

With self awareness logical thinking answer question downvoting pretty obvious far-fetched theories needed  Discussion definitely avoided, people let make minds, believe, I'm *not hurting anyone* want think pandemic, reminded it. People look data understand pandemic important, would right way it. ""money covid patients"" medicare disbursements. applied patients medicare. whole line thinking bullshit people zero clue hospitals doctor's offices things.

Believe me, hospitals making money medicare. paying country club memberships new sports cars that. Exactly. CDC data always ""artificial"" peak 7-day frequency bin, due incomplete weekend reporting. weekend numbers added Monday Tuesday numbers, results well-known artifact. like something Schindler's list someone secretly cataloging dead. History watching. Unlike jokers, I'm offended seeking advantage. Hey, we've got look first. God knows nobody else would volunteered trials want get placebo.

However, laughably faulty logic. instead 50% chance getting vaccine months general availability, prefer 0% chance? want know idea getting front line faster? shoulda joined study! ideas shitty, would work. Although get sentiment.

What need attack like fucking first world country United front. need close borders, isolate entire nation, 2 weeks. Pause mortgages etc. ENFORCE measures. begin contact tracing keep things control ramping fuck testing. leave house work tested weekly minimum. Wouldn’t happen. Trump would kill everyone else country would get elected governor would get base uproar.  understand sage 3 trials low numbers volunteers. much money poured I'd think could double triple number volunteers really check everything. understand keeping smaller first stage certain safety point people. make shit ton owners teams. corpses streets, NYC NEEDED refrigerator trucks store dead... assholes still taking seriously. Gardens fenced off, neighbours would fine. :)  Voters lose family members remember rump called virus sniffles. ready. wear masks. saying China: ""People would die wealth like birds would die food."" guess one example saying. I’m surprised number people post ok getting it. There’s way it’s safe vaccines take 15 years normally. best placebo worst something harm us. actually scared Covid? I’m not...this vaccine scares me. misinformation scares me. fact refuse acknowledge cheaper medications scare me. Something afoot one asking questions ones buried. Glad got expertise subject.  governor roll back close bars, restaurants gyms Indiana’s sending kids back schools. least get protection morons. well stop worrying quite much parents/grandparents get immunized. course change world. think 300 million doses produced right go? people front line people risk. Also time also know virus. Everyday information released discovered. Food coupons Burger King 10% discount one's next hair cut Great Clips..when pandemic over. flu season scared crap me. baby 3-year-old wait season wind down. Seemed scary previous years. even dawn told everyone scared stay home. dollars.   No, that’s math would indicate. I’ve indulged minute removing hospitalizations - it’s like cases disappear real life. Further, numbers don’t include percentage people death outcome. Yeah, love people say, ""it's # %...like someone's SOMEBODY DIED. Read bloody article people. think they've tried care. cases those. majority recover fine. that's matters here, majority. means humanity isnt mercy covid causing extinction event covid allowed run course. Especially vaccine seemingly less likely every day theres point continuing charade mask lockdowns. Well banned since March. Last month opened bit president shut Sunday night catching us unprepared again.

Wait till guys hear cigarettes outright banned since March... Anyone uses word “doomed” un-ironically cringe lacks cognitive ability assess larger life threats. two three states following numbers still low side. least work bit people NYC act like nothing ever happened want go stadium, buy expensive ticket depending sit, buy food beer instead saving money watching tv comfort home? Reading comprehension = 1
Actual reading = 0

1 x 0 still 0, unfortunately. Trump blame fire her? Guessing nothing hydrocholoroquine. can. average person dumb post. might be, peers might be, that’s self selected population. I’m big leftie generally support others want good lives losing patience average dumbass pandemic goes on. hope helps worst vaccination side effects happen right vaccination virus gives sh\*\*\*\* intentions. 0 peer-reviewed studies show correlation outdoor mass gatherings (such protests going Disney) masks rise COVID cases. Intention change science virus  dystopian hell beginning, comrade. Hold tight going tough ride. LOL wearing masks isn’t “decency” little weasel. equate wearing masks “public decency” got one retarded completely disingenuous people ever 

If want wear pointless worthless mask bow wannabe tyrants tricked go keep little sht. Yup, sign couple dozen that's takes. There's difference anti-vax scared long-term side-effects cannot yet tested time comes out. squarely vaccination probably (though I'm risk group Frontline worker think deserve get asap) scared possible repercussions later on. helps get knowing know long-term effects covid either. Wear mask anyway. agree disposable part virus terrifies tbh 

I think different worries problems similar battles cope way possible, forward.

The “assholes” mostly deal ones come contact due job, don’t care go openly fun hanging large groups I’m keeping kid home worrying social development health time, what? dickhead decide hang friends possibly exposing family, effectively making extreme measures I’m taking seem moot seems almost inevitable we’ll catch it

I honestly wish option work home like guy responding to, can’t change moment hate judge can’t Save energy Kushner, hope tried one day. right, hard comprehend different celebrity lives are.  ...

Three . Three fucking tetanus shots. Laughs Millennial poster also posts anti-mask stuff mask skepticism subreddit. He’s one those. I'd rather take compared vaccines/shots ive gotten. 

The Penicillin shot ass definitely ranks #1. HPV vaccine recommend women knocked ass week. far restrictions. Hoping cold something, hang there! grandma said aunt said peas made tongue itch. deathly allergic instead mildly allergic. 1 month &amp; still community transmission! Wow Based graphs end, curves cases hospitalizations went exponential around June 20. July 4th cause that? mean good wearing masks kinda packed football stadium. Kinda defeats purpose bit, yeah? r/topmindsofreddit Cases really flattened out. slowdown cases late April mid June still rising steadily.

In timespan, lockdown protests, plus reopened beaches Floyd protests mid June.

Cases really skyrocket end June mid July, month Southern states loosened restrictions reopened bars restaurants. I'm expert, browsing Reddit news sites, seemed though cases came either bars/restaurants, close family gatherings, church gatherings.

So Floyd protests one reasons we're seeing spike cases, we'd seeing spike cases around major cities protests happened including NYC, Minneapolis, Baltimore, Philly etc.

We're seeing that. Yes cases increasing states, they're nowhere near Texas, Florida California levels right now. Dude place literally known cult lot people bham, it’s sketch Well, they're private businesses really say. Prove it. hyperbolic almost special education teacher would say special ed reddit here. virtual learning effective general education students special education students. NY allowed special education summer school person exact reason. far peer-reviewed study pinpoint surges outdoor gatherings masks BLM protests attending beaches theme parks.

Every photo seen Disney people wearing masks problem. ""Anyone failed wear mask wore improperly charged disturbing peace, warned subsequent violations, fined jailed."" - like part. get pandemic laws 1918-America Europe 2020, please? 

Like, come on. 2/5 people wearing mask Austria wrong (nose e.g. ). Could REALLY use heavy fines... nobody cared whit single parent families since forever :(

the republican party still *blaming* collapse beaver cleaver dreamworld 3rd wave going back school, 4th wave weather gets chilly...  neighbors adorable 3 yr old love. hear outside run inside. heartbreaking. “protests” thousands people One thing really need get addressed recreational shopping. know crowding bars, churches, etc. people wear mask. I'm convinced stores like Walmart wall wall shoppers going proven lot cases coming from. Hundreds people time breathing air. learn history, history repeat itself. Damn. realize true statement going 2020. Reckon would probably also trick tho! can't help feeling common failed debate tactic. Double, triple, quadruple small things make technically right, letting text whole argument zip past you. 

It really matter one 100% confirmed reinfected, one 100% confirmed immune. people medicine *believes* reinfected, **evidence** reinfection possible. Russians *claim* vaccine makes recipient immune, **evidence** immunity possible. 

My argument evidence's existence. *Not* analysis said evidence. Trying structure counter argument perceived analysis evidence refuting argument said evidence exists. 

This gotten frustrated. stuck one sentence thousand words plus conversation. Unfortunately going gotcha moment. refuting argument, ignoring argument whole hyper focus phrasing like. still misinformation.

Misinformation false information, article gov health authorities could done lot could done lot sooner. 

In terms preparation nursing homes definitely, obviously matters could dealt wirh better way. However, general policy still debated topic. article trying distract relieve criticism gov.

This speculation opinion best. DN critical way government handle pandemic, would unlikely suddenly made u-turn in, that's opinion. here...stay well~  Nothing PR. seeing happening saw success story 2 days ago COVID sufferer recovering 120 days using protocol based finding's logic. Could coincidence course. lot steroids working alleged 'cytokine storms'.

I came COVID March 10.... still battling. I'll trialing bit - targeting bradykinin new supplement stack. Today's numbers exceptionally low Texas ain't reporting today due glitch.

The real ""fib"" numbers roughly steady since WH assumed control. People get numb thing assume new normal safety. one talks southern states rn CA Florida number eclipse it. per capita south well stupidity rubs countries? That's shame. families married look single parent families, really going families impacted know that... what’s math look like *there*...

100%?  fucking hate church highlands would dip without stimulus. risk losing job could drop $1200 new phone. People keep using word think know means. 

Draconian law, named Draco ancient Greece, laws excessively harsh. 

For example, execution punishment petty theft (an actual law set forth Draco Constitution Athens set 622BC).

He also set pretty amazing standards still use today, Common Law (being Law strictly enforced known positions high power) separation Manslaughter Homicide. 

The term **Draconian** applied situations punishment offence inequitable crime committed. 

Telling people gather large groups pandemic threat fine Draconian. 

Telling people gather large groups time threat death Draconian. Lol. could get injected virus right would could immune this. hard enough get people wear mask. can't wait see shit show vaccine actually available. People either take do, little thing happens vaccines fault. 150k still people though. They're numbers. .. there's even one dude seats back wearing mask like people nowadays wearing theres, nose &amp; mouth! still 'bad apples' back then, too. Lol🤪. Yeah, suppose could use ""I drinking soda"" (he holding onto) excuse 🤔 unfair healthcare workers teachers pay price 1. Denial math/science ✅

2. Name calling ✅

3. Confusing public decency ""muh freedumbs"" ✅ much public outcry it. [the initial responses telling put it.

Usually, Duterte ""does something right,"" listening advice experts. usually turns wanted unpopular thought would be. Well... yeah. lost 6,800 people two weeks ago 8,130 people last week, means went 19% week. 9,000 next week followed 10,000 would two 11% increases. We'll hit 19,000 14 days even we're already slamming brakes. predict that, give six day buffer... that's pretty conservative forecast. 

ok, im bit harsh. positive cases trend clearly last two weeks. Deaths could already peaked, case prediction much realistic, I'll concede that. heard one let’s go Gov. Rona DeathSentence now. Never like hyphenated names one seems perfect. education lady could BetsOn DeVirus?  Well would help president coronavirus team hadn’t kept telling people wear them. don’t even know stand anymore.

they're still committed wholeheartedly core principle: make rich people richer Yeah, formal wear looks great. would expensive hot. well shit true 3 peoplenI know barely symptoms antibodies. Wtf? live TN. reading graph right? We're fourth highest state right now?


We're like one forgettable states country. excel at? fucking terrible? Ugh. People misusing term ""Karen"" much become meaningless. Well sort of, things like public mask wearing, dining, hairdressers get attention they're that, public.

What's harder quantify control shame casual contacts among friends family happen private life. that's really primary spread happening. Yeah, actually. find vaccine started preproduction unsafe, would dispose it. 

I swear, people every left fucking house? whole sub filled 17-22 year old epidemiologists, scientists virologists? ""let's remove big portion population, killed, discount tally reasons"". realize even healthy people contract found permanent neurological damage, lung scarring, etc? Man, brain going recovery mode high level ideas telling could journalist ask question interviewing one people. everyone get ticket wear masks. little mask old diving helmet Sorry assumed things thoughts that. It’s tiring reading fearmongering thread, people talking church would packed brim thousands attendees don’t take two seconds look deeper subject. There’s lot people criticizing side aisle assembling ignoring it’s favored cause. you’re able honest sides commend that. think 11,000 deaths week globally, referring USA. really cool argument, since words you’re putting mouth point all, it’s good one discussion. Since aren’t 100% effective I’m saying don’t use numbnuts, I’m saying bars aren’t essential close numbers back within infection rates considered controlled (less 5.2% tested population).

I wear masks everywhere help. say wear don’t support - that’s really cool set points made, nothing opinion stance.

I’m saying putting others life lines necessary, groceries health care - it’s controlled effective prevention method found, keeping open hanging bars taking massive risk recreational purpose is, frankly, selfish patrons attending.

Still wear masks everywhere go, like Dr’s get groceries. don’t go anywhere else bc it’s undue risk recreation. get it’s work that’s point - re-opening sake economy fucking joke. economy isn’t person, money US government printed bolster economy - it’s citizens got less 3% - banks airlines got billions (there trillion bailout funds) go back work bc government “can’t afford” continue PUA payouts. It’s fucked. give death penalty, right spot. People used diseases Ah see fan eugenics, Reich would approve. There's difference opinion fact. poster said fact came describing circumstances park.

\*sighs, swallows handful hydroxychloroquine, drives local megachurch* Viruses spread within households No, they've deluded thinking act normal, things normal. attitude everything else that's unnecessarily spreading virus right now. seems attitude I'm at, anyway. Parents absolutely convinced back school means socialization normalcy. going one heck wake-up call see school actually like, based proposed plans. They've started small summer school type things parents STILL insisting tiny classes going okay, 1000+ student high schools. frustrating. forget hand sanitizer stations EVERYWHERE. put corner. started dismissing threat, ended dismissing virus itself. late backpedal. sit tub full goo yelling top voices goo real goo gone away completely, both.

Had started acknowledging real danger virus, pushing towards actual measures slow take care would set example. would completely ensure overwhelming support even face dramatic economic collapse. see money they’ve making? don’t care us. me, 150,000 5 months high. that's numbers know about. opinion actual numbers likely higher. 

I feel living things. took LSD young adult decided living things one consciousness. Trees ,animals ,bugs, people ball energy. really changes treat things come across. dont see riot also cant defend bunch bozo’s (and more) wearing masks, socially distancing... thousands... virus scares me. I'm BMI 28 really know cut line virus. May blur line.

Stay vigilant friend. everyone crying eyes 9/11. underestimating lot people sue happy world. isn’t listed could mean problems. 

I want see polls one too. suppose you’re anti masker antivaxxer too. 
Masks protect others yourself. 

Do advocate using rushed vaccine? Absolutely not. I'd go far say hope stubs toe morning. Almost like plan ""everyone go give virus big hug"" going fail. based hospital reports, even account excess deaths.

The secondary effects Iran evidently unusually high March. clear they've badly shook. Nah testing capacity possibility. Especially reported delays. (anecdotally) friend took test Florida, got results back ten days later. would time period. 

However best guess.  Let's start calling anti-maskers are: murderers. rule 5 sub reddit rules misinformation. I'm impiying availability masks issue regular citizen already prepared January. Hence, governments excuse, said original comment, calling widespread lockdowns.

Faucci, probably worship, said himself. masks brilliant keeping virus contained, biowaste bins installed streets?! see plenty masks discarded everywhere go. fact virus much smaller fabric face, like putting electric fence around garden keep flies out. 

Like people Reddit, come research think. came trap echo chamber. 

Let guess opinions, whole world forced take rushed vaccine too? Pretty target. good amount drug vaccine development deal legal issues regulations. 

A 1% death rate vaccine lot talking millions administered. Lots law suits. big house party friends, realises 2 weeks later parents coming back, mourns loss inconsolably...

You can't resonable discussion China reddit, seems. flu deaths numbers use estimates, actual confirmed flu deaths way lower, ""In last six flu seasons, CDC’s reported number actual confirmed flu deaths—that is, counting flu deaths way currently counting deaths coronavirus—**has ranged 3,448 15,620**, far lower numbers commonly repeated public officials even public health want link article reopening?

Working home hearing ambulances go every 20 minutes. knew COVID patients. felt horrific like everyone know lost someone know it. I’m glad NYC control ooof don’t think safety open already have. Believe it. America greatest country world

At killing citizens giving fucks [Russia’s Obesity Rate Almost 50% 5 Years, Health Ministry 60 percent Russia’s population overweight, 20 percent obese, according World Health Organization (WHO) estimates. sad thing is, we’ll hearing story lot since government won’t close schools. Yale board Rich’s OPINION. 

Here : probably take trains circulation. f-f-flu? He’s gonna hard life. Rip parents. Good luck him.

Sad many deaths could avoided people cared people federal state governments gave shit us 2016 woke around 4 checked news. Fucking crickets. Sinking feeling starts setting in. Finally found headline 'what happened election night' thought 'oh shit'. Never stopped Yes obviously citing research paper purely political. Lol. never forget State Scott fatality rate isn’t 2%, 70% population infected there’s vaccine. Even 100,000 infections day would take 7 years would clearly policy change point. take situation seriously, pointless fear-mongering. seems backwards. Wtf. graduated school said locking tuition last year taking away costs campus like gym fee, library fees, etc Haven’t heard, global pandemic hoax order disrupt national election November, Russians. I'd terrified regardless, never peak, pause rise infection rates half-assed confining, looks like death toll also get higher higher there's cure/vaccine.

The US government make strong enough effort reduce disease acceptable level, now, can't reuse strategy, one effective ones. Oof, let introduce Japan sometime. bizarre people attach identity things like here, Disney big one. explain husband that, yes, like Disney films, want merch even visit Disney Land. like colors themes, yes, clearly see decorated house, fuck I'm putting merch everywhere say I'm fan.

Although yes, nice map Middle Earth hanging wall. many state plates NY/NJ/MA past week FL. middle pandemic quit vacationing!!! wife registered mail-in year ✌🏻 ...no, millions billions dollars invested NBA. 

Capitalism working perfectly Listen, us “hustle“ get at, story nothing special. Don’t give shit hard work, sounds like work lot harder you. try act tough try imply scared/intimidated, that’s silly. math major decent computer skills. going great shape terms programming data science end upcoming school year. find another job easier 99% teachers there.

If think easily find new job, especially pending recession, especially newborn kid, bet farm it. sounds awfully risky ill advised. tell matter think right now, public going tolerate pain teachers full salaries, all, teachers working full-time, classroom. going deal virus many, many years, fact matter supply teachers getting PAID either part job none job. recession make tax revenues fall mightily throughout states. It’s going happen. book, would reason move 😑 Yes no. mean would give freedoms lockdown outside selfish mf try escape managed isolation hotel country covid free. got stay home, bubble amenities home could go walk street long avoided others. fine. travelled country outside quarantined 14 days hotel etc that's also fine. mass round people put hospital beds/beds stadiums thousands others privacy? Yeah nah. sounds close prisoner camps. America needs complete lockdown. Medical experts say lock 4-6 weeks America would control.

America [asswipes like Pastor Greg video. Trump loving evangelical pastor threatens kick teeth minimum wage Dunkin Doughnuts employee gets lip wearing mask. Video link article. Right. Low specificity problem tests too. People think safe afterwards really get covid rumors start get twice on... Last time visited, saw several people wearing pro-Mussolini t-shirts.

No didnt company sending trip Georgia Tennessee end month. concerned wife pregnant fortunate enough live one least affected states unfortunately everyone thinks fake. wife high risk, company said ""well get tested upon return"" I'm thinkin, quarantine? home high risk wife?🤔 insane. 

What best way cripple US, biggest enemy Russia, China, biggest neighbor Russia, time? want please master. No, Masks serve purpose mental. That's biological hazard seen threat, response teams turn useless piece fabric mouth. obviously zero clue fabric prevent virus particles entering leaving, pores far large secondly, eyes. massive entry points viruses enter.....face masks completely useless. Nobody wears practices sort hygiene protocol, touch face 10x mask, hilarious.

You get vaccine want, never stop you. try force one anyone else. I'll problem.

But since rushed vaccine, assume posting demanding vaccines released public coming October/November far longer trials required? way complain people wearing masks? reckon post things though, go well echo chamber... Unprecedented! Certainly cultural aspects like ""I deserve treat"" play obesity crisis, read food deserts USA. poorer communities, fast food joint gas station convenience store often place buy food miles. car, fresh vegetables menu. especially true South. I'd rather get blamed something fault less severe shit show. Cause that’s living lol transmission rate much closer measles flu. U V? know guess meant.

I believe saying putting people building imploding it, they're referencing 9/11. means people cared deaths 9/11 one gives shit 50 times number died. 

But ofc... wrong. See, even NOW, find otherwise reasonable, non science denying Americans still seem aware there's entire world things differently. think possible many Americans, even intelligent, critically thinking ones, grasp differently things vs. successfully countries them. Universal healthcare, corporate regulations, worker protections, built safety nets. hate ""both siderism"" honestly, called ""liberal"" media U.S. pulls shit acting like U.S. different fucking PLANET, asking questions like, ""But pay it?!"" everything except war machine spends ten times 2nd highest spending nation.

To wit - nearly two decades, yes DECADES, Columbine School Murders (MURDERS, ""SHOOTING KILLING"", singular, U.S. media often refers them) wondered media politician public forum might bring uniquely American school shooting problem is. wondered, ""when see comprehensive matrix NY Times regarding gun laws done around world others reacted insanity""? answer matrix, btw, November missed article two there, I've gone back, seen one, yes ONE woefully inadequate op ed piece... 2012. 

No, first time saw anyone mention news planets American centric solar system things public forum one kids survived Parkland massacre brought WHITE HOUSE live tv. rhetorically asked Trump Pence thought happened Australia single mass shooting incident many mass shootings they've since, dramatically held ""zero"" hand voice body political problem also systemic news media U.S. assists.The fucking media room ASHAMED themselves, corporate toadies are, ashamed handling pandemic now, even two weeks ago acting like long heralded ""pivot"" come get actual federal, non partisan leadership administration. believe governments help you? Grow up. Trump, clinton, biden, bernie, different sides coin. Nobody cares you, individual. difference cause need sacrificed.  That's doubt true. dare wear mask I've got think origins prohibition. lot America's ridiculous laws around alcohol origins there. worry. happen, sooner later virus run hosts. much rationale focused government's flat-footed response poor public health infrastructure, ignores significant underrecognized risk factor -- exceedingly poor baseline health country's significant risk factors hospitalization death Covid-19 presence diet-related chronic diseases hypertension, heart disease obesity. starting point?

While food insecurity providing food, nutrition insecurity providing right food, children build metabolic heath need better survive future pandemics. 300k deaths per month less number casualties month world war I, soldiers civilians included. like war, survive virus likely one (or several) life long chronical disease (pulmonary, cognitive, etc). know stastitics high even type here, numbers obscene we’d set e-learning 3 months ago could planned this.

But nothing came De Vos moved lips, bunch gibberish Exactly Maybe stock freezer again.

One witness farmers dumping milk fresh produce see Depression-era-style lines wrapped around food banks realize depths food crisis. time address nutrition insecurity support regional specialty farmers. Lower case fatality, higher transmission leads per capita fatality rate. people wise up

Absolutely nothing virus. good try. get domestic manufacturing, comment section news channel Ekstra Bladet, many people claiming certain named government officials started recommending masks getting stocks specific firms. 

Our authorities say last week buy masks danish language boxes. 

Then came reports supplies sold Friday weekend, Danish Industry association made new purchases China. 

It's relatively shameful buy masks china, reports Uighur camps turned manufacturing masks again, danish industry keeps strong ties CCP guess expected. spoke republican mother days ago phone kept stressing PLEASE wear mask stop going church apparently people wear masks (she mentioned this). Mom responds ""well killed many people"". point done. 😐 Exactly. know anything mess late February. 

I know US initially said masks required necessary total BS. 

When said, ""Keep buying. packages mail perfectly safe,"" let long groan.

The fact still admit airborne bothers me.

I wish someone would update explain surfaces contamination. virus found cruise ships nearly three weeks evacuation. So, household cleaning procedures metal, plastic, cloth, paper? everything cleaned, quarantine certain groceries deliveries week shelving opening.

I stopped buying fresh produce one addressed eliminate virus off, say, apple. We're supposed use soap, that's unhealthy. food-grade peroxide, what's ratio water that's effective enough kill virus? Surely, washing grapes strawberries water fruitless, pun intended. follow subreddits Shipt, produce horror stories...my god. People nasty.

I would guess melons, citrus banana safe thick rinds. Scrub soap water, peel cut open eat.

I use poly gloves around house. Less waste, cheaper nitrile. really protect me? know!! hope. Sometimes still wash hands glove use.

And I'm constantly weighing alcohol vs bleach vs soap water.

We're left devices, seems. WFH, isolate 100%, still find navigating difficult. would go insane roommate go errands. UK testing results 90 minutes.

Fuck em. want naturally select themselves, I’m inclined let them. still fight good fight, become half hearted passing day. someone don’t get shit together 150,000 dead, don’t think there’s hope them. literally half-brain dude. full shit even realize spewing it. every country lying deaths, Spain every media outlet saying 40K deaths health minister insists 28K disgusting. Someone needs destroy markets immediately. 19,000 beautiful, perfect deaths. take responsibility. 

-Donald J Trump Thank you! George Bush Obama regimes media problem absolutely brutal. it’s like fuck shit?! Cnn milque toast wimps history “journalism”  list really goes think it.

I feel like many problems associated mountains high elevation, inversion depression knows else, mean come on, ought get perks (other nice views good hiking ;) literally cult behavior lol.  clear. protests needed. America wasn’t god damn racist! Kick bubble. bother read understand link?

Your 'spike' driven changes data reported. Damn...... public education failure. know..... graphs pretty...

Example link: 11, Alabama changed cumulative hospitalization data source come directly hospitals rather state case surveillance files. result new data source, hospitalizations increased 3,616 3,129 6,745. Compared bars!? half million California's almost 40 million residents went bar first day could go bar.

And similar numbers folks going beach. 

And one protests … dang that's messed up! running sick? know covid? Sorry thought downplaying concerning part things. asking question things second part there. It’s concerning regardless. Taught years, awful. going fucking awesome *eating popcorn gif* Bible actually says opposite. 

Matthew 6:5 


“And pray, like hypocrites, love pray standing(B) synagogues street corners seen others. Truly tell you, received reward full. 6 pray, go room, close door pray Father,(C) unseen. Father, sees done secret, reward you.

But since Christians actually read Bible Catholic Church isn’t christian??? one same. person trusted fail, therefore can't open schools etc. *little* effort thing back February, would sailing clear re-election hero. Heck, really *not* actively fight make worse. Good. Good would think, 2020, would least progressive 1918. Hell-O Myalgia muscle soreness/pain, think intent clarify myalgia was, denote logical operator. 

That said, think it’s implied side effects weren’t experienced together. Plus common vaccines well may reduced testing dosage. 2 brands. headaches past month since using use much either bottle may unrelated. military used, mainly republicans conserative democrats, job creation program targetting rural poor tool build nationalist sympathy primary demographic.

It insane people realize this. could cut military spending quarter (at least) still left sizable force capable defending nation values, put money towards effective employment program would cost less, leave participants meaningful skills employable, graduates come much better shape.

Think program small number coders professionals work large groups recruits reconfigure current, often outdated clunky federal computer systems. program participants placed jobs designed modernize infrastructure leading education specialized fields construction demand right now. costs programs would comparably miniscule compared military budget. upvoted fact it’s 1,000+ deaths day believe true. households least one member must leave due jobs responsibilities.

Even living areas attending church service still about.

Those people families pay price get sick kind carelessness. You’re going get bigger Ralphie May. it’s flu!  new goal post? realize people running excuses pretend things fine, damn dark. Profile states you’re anti-vaxxer, flat-earthier, climate change denier...and posts free karma subreddits asking downvoted? Okay, negative karma farmer... Yeah need sign wavers saying won’t go hospital. absolutely abhorrent. Starting online sensible. Either procedures put place work schools stay open, fail schools cannot open.

Waiting weeks changes nothing. vaccine open, schools go person procedures prevent transmissions work. way know work test them. Delaying opening delays finding school capable opening staying open. act gambling fun matter much money have. See Charles Barkely Michael Jordan. Think it. vaccines rolled phases. anti-vaxxer refuses, move next person. Eventually entire society vaccinated anti-vaxxers not.

For every vaccine refused anti-vaxxer, someone else isnt idiot would get vaccinated. negative this. 19K? That's around 1K/day average days. Flattening curve, baby! Well you’re luck. CDC tracks overall mortality causes compared previous years. Scroll middle page graph. phone make sure turn horizontal.

[Dr. Fauci regret advising masks early pandemic - Business  goes normal unhinged quickly.

I'm sure use lot disinfectant, Disney afford access it.   administration would offended could read. standard flu vaccine fucked entire arm up, worked way hard gym. felt like every muscle fiber arm torn shit

From tiny flu vaccine lol, nothing know. attach economic recovery numbers like sane relief plan. in-person schools seem crazy me. going like this, widespread NFL, nobody going know ridiculously bad kids, parents, school staff routinely tested. Assuming lasts day two injection, doesn’t sound much worse meningitis vaccine. use glory hole

Not saying people wearing mask today, saw photos [healthy, young dying Covid-19, people debating wearing one. know pressing point, small part issue. bad bot. someone ask mask camp deaths much higher countries? mean realize nothing testing volume.

Once idiots gone, free celebrate rebuild world heathen liberal image. Guy work wears mask day long. Except he’s eating. which, proceeds lick fingers, without washing hands after. 

Other guy share office nasty staph infection arm. Left untreated weeks, nonchalantly going business thought care potentially transmitting infection others. 

It’s like people don’t wash hands pooping. much pain death could avoided people would wash hands. 

I don’t think half people wearing masks even understand concept germs social responsibility.

Dr. Fauci MLB shouldve done bubble like NBA. Sitting two hours next people everybody constantly yelling makes excellent coronavirus petri dish. years flu shot fucks arm, years much. Teachers included first line, know open schools. vaccine tested 18 means approved 18 above. medications used pediatrics label, know vaccines fall category. talks trials pediatrics probably adult trials completed. Question people go get tested experiencing symptoms: value test results given days weeks later? minority control police governments. bar low, people don’t even register speed bump. church pro virus apparently... spread it! Yes can! gave Democrat senator removed confederate statues state

God wish represented reality here. 
The Democratic senator got elected, barely, convincing evidence came light prior election opponent history sexual assault and/or impropriety minors. 
And no, confederate statues removed. I'm sure got idea.  think bikers sturgis going wearing masks, even dumber original statement would lead us believe. Believe not, body produce animal DNA! Let Darwin work. don’t want essential workers get sick. even wear mask N95 valve don’t want get grocer sick case I’m presymptomatic. that’s place go, grocery store.

I get takeout plopped trunk week, tip 25% support business.

But distant I’ll fine, don’t want part chain, think need ease bit.

But area care, I’m done trying talk sense them. Tell turn Fox News. free turn CNN American news sources well think's they're Democrat bullshit.

Suggest follow foreign news sources instead. UK's BBC News. Germany's DW. Singapore's Channels News Asia. Australia's Channel 9 news. read happening America. Follow happening countries instead, specifically Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam. Maybe gets outside perspective, might open eyes little. Yes, lol. making correct assertions, missing purposes.

Yes - agree large majority people likely contract virus. think everybody agrees that.

Yes - masks definitely delaying procedure, *when combined social distancing* found 65%-90% effective, depending study look at.

Yes - indeed difference infection rate per 100,000 vs death rate per 100,000

No - multiple studies shown herd immunity really guaranteed option particular virus, least decent vaccine developed. People largely losing antibodies several months, several cases reinfection found. We're still little early know much issue pose

No - number cases reported bad thing, rates infection per 100,000 still higher places world. Now, still believe need much testing physically possible, make mistake, numbers good compared countries. lot asymptomatic cases, everyone. people take account every death, ton people hospitalized likely lifelong lung/other organ damage result.

No - case may asymptomatic particular person mean can't pass immunocompromised person. Again, generally young/relatively healthy people dying this. elderly, cancer patients, already immunocompromised risk. Flattening curve essential hospitals give individuals best chance recovery if/when catch it.

No - Let's forget basically entire world working vaccine thing, likely reliable, mass-produceable one within 6 months - 2 years (at least based current estimates). that's great all, masks + social distancing imperative vaccine ready available. Hey, hospital month, half time unpaid leave! keep pushing open schools???
/s  doesn’t take intelligence inherit something. fuck would go cruise? You’re right it’s actually worse. Instead one city getting hit outbreak there’s 22 locations around state potentially cause outbreak. church claims 60,000 members statewide. get you’re saying 60,000 people one arena would catastrophic 3,000 campus 22 locations would even worse. Hopefully small percentage participate person. Eating primates really line Enjoy everything reap.. Every single epidemiologist country fucking flooding WH letters support Fauci. 91! USA failing state, teetering failed state. FYI rumor little substance it. would suggest IFR even lower CDC's current estimate ~0.6%. Contact OANN right wing news outlet let verify it. lots people would love promote story. fully expect see story news tomorrow. Not. also boost immunity overall, since vaccine 100% effective. vaccinate people, also protect ones get bout get full immunity.

But yes, part people get okay (pending info efficacy thing). Take meds! Fuck yes. I'm made this. tests suuuuper preliminary. said possible known sure yet. course I’m sure contract went deserving friend Administration though! someone montreal, didnt want april. city 1.3 million quarter countries cases 27k 103k nose get broken put mask it. might protect one woman meet bar, see, happens asymptomatic, get tested, turn infects family, asthmatic 6 year old son dies ventilator months. husband passes onto brother, camping trip, brother gets 80 year old mother infected, lives nursing home. nursing home becomes new cluster, like many others. 

That worse case scenario. ever get stop worse case scenario, wearing piece cloth face? Again, simple, easy. Vaccine bigger hoax virus  I’m Orlando know people going constantly, friends hanging people. say it’s “safer going grocery store” reply yeah probably, eat. can’t reason people like usually end convo “well different opinions.” Especially frustrating immunosuppressants people like essentially killed social life. I’ve left house 5 times since March blood draws things managing autoimmune disorder. Hindsight 20/20

/s 👌 Yes minions, trillion dollar poison almost ready forced entire universe, Hahahahaha.... question nothing!!! Wear masks.

Please do.  “I know run long distances.""

I'll leave right here... I'm doctor scientist. bear me... but, no. Get fucked. people’s lives work closing, employees losing jobs, etc.

I hope happy dream world McDonalds Olive Gardens things survive. Sadly necessary. Many people saying going Alaska would go somewhere b.c. instead. would sight see along way. 
 Canada brought covid case kind stable, can't afford fuck up. can't say know ton what's going white house, can't help get feeling Fauci incredibly resilient despite political backlash he's had. wish way encourage writing something.

I'm super passive aggressive I'm almost point breaking. cannot afford sick. I'm dying/getting sick/having hospital bills bc idiots. fully grown adults struggle put mask correctly - COVER FUCKING NOSES! Quit pulling talk people. Stop getting close letting kids wander around. ignore published death figures UK currently review:  


The better metric look ONS data comes delay week counts coronavirus deaths mention death certificate. figure puts around 25 deaths per day last week. 
  


The UK response initially horrendous, largely control although latest ONS infection survey (a statistically random sample estimate many community) indicated small rise recently.  


Whilst cases slight rise, hospitalisations deaths still trending downwards yet. information UK found here:  3000 died 9/11.

150,000 americans died since march covid-19 getting quotes though? Probably place That's pretty short-sighted, I'm sure aware, already dragged enough ought able start seeing folly that. Disapproval dipshit leaders spreading fast virus. Desantis' popularity [getting polls looking hot incumbent either. Probable cause, getting arrested resisting arrest. Enjoy knee neck!  incarcerated also increases risk dying means, COVID. Protestors outside San Quentin holding signs saying ""release prisoners NOW"" - keep mind county jail - state prison wherein worst offenders deprived, inhumane crimes ever committed kept. Duh. ""Jock""? Reddit filled jilted teens thought. $150 per visit would argue ones little suspicious whole situation would real idiots difference that, rich (or simply middle-class) work home (or even better cabin mountain apartment sea-shore). go week get groceries (and let's say twice week duties). basically spend like 3x 30 minutes per week. 

If working class cannot work remotely, spent 5x8h per day + 1h bus/tram/metro go work . absolutely level exposure risk. Right, mask mandates Continuum lol model COVID-19, headline misleading. 11,000 deaths per week 97.5th percentile. median estimate 7,000 deaths per week.

Source: math right, 4,750. So, know, few. I'm part 30,000 worldwide phase 3 study. vaccines different, Oxford traditional vaccine Pfizer (and Moderna) new mRNA approach. Wait start talking secondary deaths pandemic. third less people diagnosed cancer previous years.

Cancer doesn’t magically go away. People going physician issues don’t want risk COVID, road expect cancer mortality rates climb. Issa gonna die? Except risk exposure going grocery store much lower working one 8/10 hours day everyday. remember reading first going China back January. It’s crazy 8 months ago instead whole different year. ever get much time once. :) wrong. PCR specific, low false positive rate, 30%, like 1%. glad I'm alone lol, also sad face can't wait see happens $300 Acorns account. Going get taste high life! Well unemployed people live houses, homeless street. Theres difference. scrolled past though... “German study finds 81% people study already possess form immunity COVID-19 due infections coronaviruses” what’s true?! imagine Americans would reacted true forced lockdown gps bracelets military brought in, food left doors? Americans can’t handle wearing masks even social distancing many travelling. They’ve made pandemic personal political storyline believe everything America. Lunacy, it’s even sad. It’s horrifying virus steal shit. Lack leadership, mishandling, honesty, communication, education empathy. People  know shot trump, honestly golfing help vitamin shown lower mortality rates covid  lot people enjoy work, whole point retiring typically body doesn’t want work it’s best interest health retire. Thank god that. Except removes uncertainty. People struggling cope social distancing restrictions. glimmer hope end end horizon makes huge difference. changes I'm worries prez leaving. leave. Even secret service bind entire former first family toss van. 

The damage could November January throwing tantrums amidst fits rage kind concerns me. Ugh. mean, nothing really done that's chooses. need work, enjoys job.

At moment, concerned health.  Depends you’re based. England money protected FSCS. get 85k per person per financial institution bank collapses That's 1571 deaths day btw Fear mongerers believe government tampering conspiracy theories suits them. many people even wear masks know even consider one. remember joy halls dorm block party happened college night Obama won. much excitement love. Pure happiness hope.

Then remember 2016: accidentally fell asleep woke past 11 pm see Trump won. Smoked two cigarettes outside cried sleep. fuck shit trumps fault again?? cannot answer w complete asshat think one insidious aspects virus commonly long lasting damage body. Spanish flu too, extent covid-19 does. 

Even virus doesn’t kill outright infection, damages leaves tens millions survivors USA result shortened life expectancies.  really matter considering last one happened due racist police murders. guy charge hide bunker profess love confedracy twitter. Waiting evidence sometimes waiting late. Maybe, fingers crossed! Loved analogy/bit.

[John eat eat. horror. FYI, estimates 65,000 - 75,000 Canadians living illegally U.S. Apparently can't follow simple rules, either. fans stands /s don’t remember exact language used, maybe could handled better. You’re right risk lying eroding public trust, agree happens time. local dim sum great. sit two tables inside time, make wash hands take temp test, require mask servers approach table. feel okay place.

I mean nice sensible risks indoor dining, let's face it... experience many people willing pay premium for. Many restaurants go belly year, there's way around that. thinking, might still need yep, mean thrilled increased chance one get sick die way time. neccessarily first time pick choose considered incivility things happen one care bad things happen person I'm responding literally evidence they've COVID, yet thinks COVID. understand burden proof showing COVID.

And burden proof fact needs showing disease, reverse, reverse going *actively dangerous* anyone come contact with.

The danger false negative restrict need to. danger false positive restrict much either family friends (and everyone else society extension) risk dying contracting transmitting disease.

So problem assertive issue. absence positive indication someone COVID need assumed it. Anything else _dangerous bullshit_. ""worst flu life"". COVID diagnosis.

And know antibody tests perfect.  literally title article about. get antibody test negative, need behave like immunity matter chances test wrong. matter.

And fact PCR diagnosis available mean assume COVID diagnosis basis self-diagnosis get test. get test, flu-like symptoms back March nothing else go sucks you, self-diagnosis still medically worthless. still need presume COVID, _because otherwise place everyone else society risk_.

And I'm certain reason many hypochondriacs think caught COVID early lot using excuse rationale sloppy predictions. human nature rationalize, claims early COVID zero medical evidence contracted anything flu going feeding rationalizations. Again, makes believing COVID without medical diagnosis _dangerous bullshit_ places everyone else risk.

And see thread people mild illness combined loss smell/taste still getting antibody tests turning positive. someone laid ""worst flu life"" claim ""mild"" enough illness ignore results negative antibody test basis title paper dumb. Everyone ""the worst flu life"" seroconvert. really think test wrong, get another one, I'll money second test coming back negative. antibody tests find antibodies they're found, bigger issue false positives due cross reactivity seasonal coronavirus antibodies. go school Indiana next week thoroughly unprepared, masks hand sanitizer. TRY keep 2 kids per seat bus, short paras, bus drivers, lunch personnel, subs. Oh, still playing football local teams case spread around enough Friday! able dodge long data also collected 3rd parties eventually exposed. Yup. really wonder point antimaskers, conspiracy theorists stop nonsense. 200k dead? 250? 300? point everyone know someone one person removed knowing someone died hospitalized this. I'm surprised call peds nurse help. nurses find good vein remain stable like magic power. That's also another factor. Vitamin improves one's general immune system. Probably, contagious, morons can't spread it, die it. Sweden closed borders non-EU citizens mid end-March rest EU (it decision taken together). even allow people registered residents (because family someone resident here) come Sweden country (a lot immigrants families still abroad). amended May think. Foreign ministry still advising travel long list countries advice people travel insurances valid. give anti- believers / anti-maskers vaccine people acted accordingly flatten curve get vaccinated first. going act entitled full Karen mode vaccine becomes available. don’t need it. right; assumption based long might take reach something like ""herd immunity."" I'm jumping conclusions. edit, thanks. Give headache means won’t die ARDS mystery clot Yeah, mean that, like there's policy all. like ""leave states"" that's state live masking policy, left individual county. state government's Department Health basically ""politely asking"" residents wear masks homepage, ridiculous. 

&amp;#x200B;

I friends live EU they've emailed asking, heck going US, okay? embarrassing explain we're lead death cult wants sacrifice poor, old, disabled name profit. 

Stay safe. anti maskers think vaccine elaborate plan get us microchipped. get it. They'll hydrochlo whatever vaccine. people screeching ventilators unneeded. correct. Username checks out! Different how? think exposed sick people noises monitors? Plus antibodies now...


Also pays pay raises? Hospitals stopped elective surgeries extra money everyone supposed come from? create data send bbc fox, leaked data given anonymously. missed recent economic events last quarter? hear things bit sluggish. Sorta? People still dying alarming rates. means less people die future good. Exact story me. wait several hours night could find nurse could stick properly. Thank vampire night nurse IV-placing skills, wherever are! Entitlement kills. death cults! amount state vacationers going last. suspect uptick cases soon enough.   living rock 6 months? could go wrong! Watch Covid spikes 5 10 days start event.... take cues Chinese manufacturing obsolescence.  ""Bring on""

- introverts seem think modulates immune system, prevents ""Cytokine Storm"". damage increases mortality rate. Right. military waste money. It’s fucking joke look spend. could cut military literally half would effect half money. let’s #support troops. yeah well China shutdown Wuhan knew something up... think governments know something sad is, really need many restaurants have. bars matter. demand wear mask literally crosses end-of-the-nose freedom-line mentioned there. 

That's irony you. H1N1 flu strain 2009 ""continues circulate seasonal flu virus, cause illness, hospitalization, deaths worldwide every year."" 

So Covid-19 may considered pandemic two years, likely still us. could new pandemics then.  head twitter see quite lot people saying joke etc. basically every comment section Covid-19 article. reason see people Reddit, Twitter seems. That's like Reddit, people brain. would low end. We're currently 1100 day average, average rising steadly month. I'd say likely get 23-24k next 3 weeks. fuck social distancing. Someone needs review Matthew Chapter 6...

""And pray, like hypocrites, love pray standing synagogues street corners seen others. [...] **But pray, go room, close door pray Father, unseen. Father, sees done secret, reward you.**
[...]
“When fast, look somber hypocrites do, disfigure faces show others fasting. [...] fast, put oil head wash face, obvious others fasting, Father, unseen; Father, sees done secret, reward you.""

TL;DR **Jesus literally specifically said praying home, private, really great idea!** also fasting private thing Big Public Thing! #DeathCult Hell, even upside ""being able near people go public events"" would take mild inconvenience. Instead also save millions, including myself. Could great awakening sub? Described [RadioLab even results study show cloth face masks effective wearing mask all. think finish phase 3 trials, results good, they’ll release limited use? I’m thinking release emergency use frontline workers people high risk. He's telling tv partners look alternate programming though. 90 days till elections elections look like falling deaths cases lot worse. Yeah...I miss going gym CNN one screen Fox another. Read CC each, biases evident. Lol ignorant statement read flynn effect; apparently people back average IQ 70 today's standards, 30 lower today's average. Regardless, people appear stupider today. Whatever causes beyond me, since definitely lack available information. Next April still wildly ahead best expectations months ago. I've trying heavily temper outlook start, counter hopeless optimists somehow positive we'd vaccine Fall. April barely seems like wait anymore. don’t. FedEx packages better. Exactly crazy still half month missing data. That's another 15000 atleast. Well apart lockdown Sweden strange things. also country using border closures.

All rest standard stuff. Oh Anthrax multi-parter well, best is, completing initial series doses, still need yearly booster shot want keep immunity. forgetting crippling inflation hit 2022. They'll cost equivalent two Big Macs extension cord long enough hang with. I've heard anti-vax numbers alone would cause enough problem US prevent proper herd immunity. makes sense, we've seen measles keep popping up, basically gone while. Imagine freaking totally OK huge industrialized pig cattle farms Next Trump anyone expert Jesus Christ people. Please love God open eyes. BMI accurate absolute vast majority people. We're easily talking 99% population more. every Terry Crews 100 regular people walking streets. BMI fantastic allows anyone easily without medical intervention ballpark are. Yet constantly see Redditors dismissing bullshit.

This like saying COVID vaccine useless 99% effective. Use head people. virus 100% fatal, believe me, everyone would stayed inside adopted rules default without law. issue virus subtle gets large communities infects kills select people see long term damages. good framework built, whole country understand health emergencies dependent lack legislation people prevent infection spreading. Sadly, lot misinformation incertitude spread faster virus made people complacent situation. Careful friend, automod might get talk like /s statement, observation several emerging preprints completely verified independently finding results. know yet autoimmune issue completely new viral one. know exist however, anyone functioning ability research things read internet find within seconds searching keywords, slightly older report argues know may antiphospholipid connection critical patients endothelial dysfunction clotting experiencing. also know antibodies often genetic determined autoimmune issue may noticeably present instigated condition. however, non-genetic response infection without underlying autoimmune condition, argument based family history things lupus rheumatoid arthritis certain ethnic groups various nations hit harder others.   

Hence said multiple times researched seems likely nothing confirmed, much virus. take great pleasure knowing nobody real life takes seriously lol bruise small pooling blood skin right? I'm saying vaccine shot bruise cause pain mechanism, small pooling liquid  estimated anywhere quarter third living creatures parasites. 

Life cruel Thank Yeah Ive set expectations early 2021, Oxford said vaccine ready September earliest hard time believing DR FUCKY YESSSSS Houston checking in.  summer, stay largely indoors time. Fall, Winter, Spring pretty nice. I'm curious well. spoken Oxford vaccine? furthers along trials. Seems like one successful. Palestinian kids got shots maybe able throw many rocks soldiers?


(Just case, I'm well aware extreme simplification make quip, friendly reminder reddit, UN) Remember friends. rules apply virus cure: know true effects 10 years.

This vaccine rushed, though good reasons, never take vaccine thoroughly tested labs time. america🙇🏻‍♂️ Isn’t good sign body reacting antigens? agree 100%. Esp. Americans keep ignoring advice keep putting lives danger treat us. Fuck vaccine AZ timeline ends September/October. ./happydance ^ Imagine openly flaunting complete lack critical thinking lol That's goal. many attempts embezzlement even get stopped, rest get through. They've embraced Zerg tactic commiting crimes. doubt that’s true even 95% SURVIVAL still ridiculous close country require people wear masks sometimes certain states never go well. force people things expect bow wannabe Fascist Tyranny idiots think live fantasy world. Gotta love sociopath literally gives zero fucks people individual level.

POTUS sin TÚ = POS

The joke (or truth, rather) makes sense Spanish bilinguals. Dude got wrong. It’s alien DNA demon sperm. Wow awful. Sadly, can't say surprised. Yeah mom well. Tell stop jk ;p part BEAT don’t understand. don’t need useless Americant worrying look reddit thanks. You’re wrong. spread misinformation that’s really terrible look got going on. Also immunity all-or-nothing deal. Maybe 80% enough, A) slow considerably B) leave people without risk everything get started back again. didnt assume disagreement. heard Birx minutes ago mutation could merit new spread.....anyway yeah doesnt matter anyway since shit Oh, agree. That’s caveated ‘unless turn around’ etc. Yes, probably somewhere 200 500, big range, I’m extrapolating. shall see Nov 3, frankly almost every estimate I’ve seen CDC underestimate that’s think making assumptions American culture models hasn’t panned true. Well, enough people die, eventually start affecting lot Americans. Eventually, know heard someone contracting it/being hospitalized/dying. mean, it’s horrible, people horrible statistics. number screen? Hoax. Flu. Fake news. Someone know dying? Omigod, take seriously. dying enough reward... lagging indicators that’s exact logic Texas used wheels came off. it’s covering nose it’s pretty much useless.

OK, worry unlikely covid infiltration semi-exposed nose, I'll worry unlikely covid infiltration exposed eyes. doubt I'm better protected shoppers. church fits 4,000 people doesn’t mean 4,000 people show up. mother frequently sends asinine tripe found youtube, especially pandemic. real problem. really hope it’s high risk people Christmas, want see family. Catholic Church Christian church vary different ways chrstian churches don’t usually confession Christian churches don’t believe Mary sinless. Christians believe saints sort divine power. Yeah, even death count makes fucking sense anymore. hear idiots say, death rate lower south warmer humid. Like, ""oh yeah buddy? Tell fucking Brazil!"" I'm problem it. Good grief. way put place program identifies break rules let alone however fall sick, denied treatment? still fair rest us try ot safe, protect others, patriotically suport Nation economy simple steps like wearing masks, would least little just. can't process gems transmitted understand scientists come recommendations, follow basic guidelines.

China bad. US things mean China bad, means US shittier. 5 months prepare government running around like headless chicken weeks opening. ""post-fun"" era? ""might nail coffin.""

God, hope so. say Fauci told (or anything close it) said actual pandemic part disease could November. Whatever man good look definitely takes conscious effort “take in” number. Like hold up, 11,000...?! think group family friends... number astronomical me, especially since could’ve done much minimize it... sigh... St. Peter: “I’d let heaven flattening curve “ Labcorps website says PCR close 100% positive, negative necessarily negative (false neg). idk depends facility/machine/collection method (or properly collected) used success rates vary not. know rapids inaccurate PCR pretty flawed too.

What Americans living odd border areas like NorthWest Angle Point Roberts? mention towns bisected border like Beebe plain.

How pandemic border shutdown affected them?   solution cases move Europe! /s US higher mask-wearing rates European countries (Spain Italy compare pretty well, US way ahead Sweden UK). Alabama currently statewide mask law effect. Gonna need source everything I’ve seen shows false negatives issue PCR. that’s mainly due virus present large enough quantities detected time swab performed. lab work shown greater 97% accuracy positive results. didn’t fucking work Racist laws.

on serious note, syncs Fauci saying  youre lucky, job benefits pay test, medical care, days work. Sadly, many people america lucky job like almost 1 5 unemployed.

God sort out. End August IIRC. could good day. November! Dr fauci told me! What’s good look giving people false hope mis representing information. I’ll call misinformation time see it. beat it! useless Americant people saying "" get back reaches 67k deaths like Obama's swine flu""?

Haven't heard recently. pandemic worse one. turns ISIS mad religious death cult world. 200 per day three days week. Sounds like pretty good system. What's problem? real stat, least several years ago. might gone since then. I'm betting up. didn’t happen... it’s heartbreaking. Touche I'm disagreement you. believe say multiple versions coronavirus floating around. one version ten versions, still screwed last version kills people goes away. mean lot states especially North East coronavirus control mitigation state taking nkt bad opinion. Jesus take wheel also think they've conflated right express opinion opinion valid carries Merit expert academic professional. went Church Highlands 21 days prayer event years ago (I don’t go myself, went friend did). maybe 100 people auditorium seated thousands. It’s hard following distancing guidelines that’s case. It’s also 6 every day, means crowds won’t huge. thousand people spread 22 locations different days, probably won’t get couple hundred people together time spaces made much larger crowds.

Also keep mind church opened first testing center state back March main campus, it’s like they’re ignoring coronavirus concerns. I'm terrified September/October get here. Even schools offer sort online learning option, feel like majority parents going send kids school anyways. Hey, don’t like driving drunk maybe stay roads. That's possible, think point estimates sucker's game. plausible range going somewhere 200k say 400k. many variables, uncertainty, many interacting nonlinearly, confident point estimate. crazy part state mask mandate apply church services...

it's far-fetched idea really! would love get Moderna vaccine, long studies show it’s safe side effects comparable vaccines.

Like frick, we’re persecuted. people telling us publicly reject Jesus whatever, sure, call persecution. ask churches meet health safety congregations around them? called love neighbour greatest commandment?! That’s directly ignoring everything Jesus tells us.

I’ve seriously lost ton respect lot churches leaders. guess least tell genuine churches Christians respecting health guides, ones want feel like they’re better everyone else cry persecution public safety recommendations. think ""independent thinking"" identity. worked Walmart, absolutely say Walmart heavy middle management. found added little value besides micromanaging cashing big bonuses stock options.

Welcome America! public given notice would reporting today August 2nd, read article Texas longer counting rapid tests towards positive cases. antigen tests considered ""probable"" cases. 

 

Almost everyone know, including workplace rapid tests, usually get results back within 24-48 hours versus 3-7 days PCR test. Yet hospitalizations dropping dramatically Texas, thats something optimistic assuming numbers trustworthy.   Fast tracking medication almost never goes wrong... I'm guessing first company create viable vaccine essentially print money sun explodes, make patent open source developers?

Or looking another issue altogether? encourage biker scum go Sturgis get covid 19. Good riddance bad rubbish. hear you. It’s anxious time. lot don’t know virus. It’s easy grab ahold scariest studies take absolute truth. I’m living assumption people probably okay (especially young, healthy people). time, I’m functionally living like could pass anyone - could harmful (staying home much possible, working home, etc.). It’s weird tension live in, that’s I’m making work. hope find something works - talking someone trust and/or therapist could help. sorry teachers situation. students forced go back unwillingly well. whole situation saddens much.

Im regular citizen bought masks back January. Yeah called CBP. going return Canada LA home month. said need Quarantine 14 days. friend drop groceries 2 weeks.  Fair enough. 

But I'm going drive sleep car way up.(i mattress camping gear). I'm worried car vandalized cause I'll still Cali plates... American Christian fundamentalists already built second Noah's ark, shift outdoors, wear BLM shirt case. way, nobody even dare suggest blame even single covid case. needs vaccine BLM shirt? LOL. would awesome- also crash economy. It’d better government paid rent well, know banks crooks letting crash people aren’t paying bills won’t good anyone.  grampie granny 100X tougher current offerings USA bring.

Tougher.

Stronger.

Faster....and way smarter. worries, that’s good idea

I pretty sure still needed placebo arm even pandemic, many vaccines it’s possible one didn’t

There one trial Hospital Melbourne (Australia) BCG vaccine already approved things, able fast track it, new except guy wearing improperly nose. Pretty close impossible US. Even New York's Governor Cuomo said absolutely idea shutting state borders. Yah, thought. ""I saw people travel travelled. Stop it."" also assuming infected? ... call US sheep! Dumbasses gonna dumbass. It’s like force nature. open everything fewer deaths, also stop requiring masks. Crappiest Place Earth. BMI reliable 99% population. Rock extreme outlier.

because statement correct all. 99% actually like 50-60%. BMI useful individual, general population trends. hope it. Bikers racist moron scumbags. Good riddance bad rubbish. Happy cake day! Darwin demands tributes. Facts gonna basic generic general public white people corny FaceBook Generation X humor right?! making ever Yeah; understand immune system understand immunologist friend, several layers defense - one sort old data storage trigger seen, messages sent begin producing associated antibodies actually work.

As long mutate much like flu does, subsequent bouts mostly asymptomatic -- know lag time/transmisability period. don’t understand read 150,000 deaths call hoax. peachy seems like huge unprotected orgy sharing needles dozen tweakers also drinking small glass orange juice ward diseases. He's really bad stay inside get cardio in. problem solved, Karen! think closing schools zero cases really paranoid dumb? smart know statistics comparatively flu?

Without deep search -- I'll say reason hard time flu numbers (1) vary lot season season virus varies season season (2) many people seek treatment (so numbers estimated -- sound familiar?).

That said, last decade, annual deaths range 12,000 61,000 per year infected ranging 9.3m 45m symptomatic cases. [around 680 17s died flu 2017-18 wanted chime in. I'm TN closely followed data since beginning. State county numbers add up. There's little way know numbers actually due fuckery every level process here. county banned science reporter Dept Health meetings asking difficult questions... might airline required wear mask. Usually American military personnel tend ride civilian airlines. American airline companies currently mask requirement order ride plane. 

As right now, understanding, White House expressing discontent requirements. Yup. Truth stranger actually differs little suggesting, either would extremely helpful, especially right now. see there... don’t like read things contradict world views 

All countries using HCQ significantly better results It’s probably 20 percent state revenue sturgis income year yet Dr Fauci epidemiologist. expert spread infectious disease. way expert subject, including efficacy vaccines. won’t discomfort breathing mask several minutes. wear face mask face shield store move mask nose inside. people don’t travel much didn’t really pay attention school. Good idea wonder sort protection vaccine would offer, came contact someone vaccinated! assume would give measure protection, long get necessary boosters continue distance/mask?
Another thing thought looking lines clinic get initial vaccine (once offered general public) Inside, yes. Don’t need one outside day.  Misinformation. American opinions can’t trusted. yore still far right extremist consumes far right extremist propaganda. confusing ""traditional Chinese medicine"" ancient traditions.

TCM know today invented propaganda stunt 1960s communist party. China doctors, China could increase number world leading would huge win politically.

Mao Zedong pushed Chinese medical association find way this. Clearly, training people Western way would take years unaffordable. So, concept TCM developed - something simple enough could taught anyone weeks, apparent ""ancient wisdom"" it.

Of course, people top knew scam. Mao Zedong refused use TCM believe it. Jokes them, wait till discover average citizens economy. vaccine comes, masks taken off. Assuming vaccine comes winter spring, could normal life back summer. thought serious second sheesh ive seen sub depends vaccine released. I'm hoping release data behind trials. I'm little scared current administration rush one election. probably take case I'm anti-vaxxer instance. 

If lot data released health professionals say safe I'm it. read oxford one developemnt years slightly different virus changed coronavirus. base vaccine gone lot studies shown safe. can't find article mentioning hate searching anything specific COVID google. positivity rate new tests 17% - that's slightly 18 20 percent recently.

Schools colleges open yet cheer yet. really help though - R(eff) that's relatively low still 1.0 basic exponential shape level infections remains - takes longer hits inflection point becomes critical. good thing still reduce peak load healthcare system - bad thing makes undetected growth large geographic area much likely.

High density cities like NY regarded akin canary coal mine - instead lot country shrugged went ""big city problem"". Boy going great far. Phase-3 started tight-lipped phase-2 results. Ty explanation, never actually heard w2 gigs term till now.

Wonder warranted downvotes first comment  brotha. hope everything works guys. ^ right here. Uh, uncivil celebrating favorite crustaceans? Develop plan priority visit outside marriage contract.

You're going need something concrete accept people hypothetical plan though, get classic ""my girlfriend totally Canada"" rhetoric. Remember, needs quick easy border patrol investigate. 

Also, would plan be? one week two negative tests? many people going let in? Again, CBSA agent quickly determine telling truth? police resources check bunch people? visiting Americans pay extra resources needed check going breed enough resentment people getting Canada type oversight

If border remains closed, get already been? Especially since closing things like Alaska NHL necessary yet let exempt.

I agree NHL definitely necessary, however much robust comprehensive plan even 14 day quarantine. 

The NHL rigorous program, put bubbles two weeks *before* left USA, anyone contact outside bubble isolate bubble 14 days. players personnel tested daily, 0 positive results week entering Canada. Canada, also within bubble allowed leave, condition anyone else entering Canada. also still get tested daily.

If Americans coming Canada willing isolate 14 days entering Canada, tested every day, live entirely within bubble Canada also getting tested every day, sure. that's going happen. like said originally, it'd ""unrealistic."" I'm gonna disagree there- like idea protest pandemic? no, regular flippant murder people supposed protect us (and actually obligation so) good reason any. Fun fact: stands still exist beneath current stadium stands. Spanish flu go away ? vaccine ? Masks? herd immunity ? Child care centers bit easier regards enforcing small group instruction. example, let’s say 3 year old class 10 kids. 10 kids intermingling kids day. They’ll teacher(s) day room, large group activities. That’s way state, least. 

Sadly, public schools (to knowledge) pods 10 students teacher day. Schools probably can’t operate small class sizes. un-American. Especially considering southern states notorious healthy begin due poor diet exercise. go lot, actually. sounds like whole lot disinfectant daily. Plus delaying rides clean mess timing attractions. wouldn’t even surprised. That’s awful. Hoping best her. 1000 died today America. don’t final stats yet I’m pretty sure. Six days week 1000. need pay parents important job raising smart kids. Taking care elderly family, etc. UBI would fix thisnn Tell history Americans harder herd immunity. probably right! realised diarrhea actually burned. way I've looking could way base this, look like testing. Testing started really slow, continuously improved time. theory, make vaccine provides immunity, we're administering vaccine, they're still working improve it. maybe get vaccinated six months, could every year like flu eventually. What? I'm even sure next comment talking about. I'm literally saying looking predictions useless part Haha well meant pandemic/worst part know corona far later. Idk Oxfords vaccine gets approved September don’t think that’s craziest prediction I’m simple man, never upvote four letters. graduated 2009,went graduate school, got PhD hitting end post doctoral training year.

Even vaccine gets 20% public, lowers virus severity something like 40%, would HUGE impact pandemic. Doctors paid well insane liability insurance costs offset much high pay. doctor doesn’t worry does—he may dozen nurses, hundred EMT’s paramedics working license. doctor know OB/GYN switched gynecology paying almost $100,000/year liability insurance. still keep insurance 20+ years last kid delivered, kid turns 18, waits year two sued “wrongful birth” needs insurance cover him. 

As EMT yearly insurance couple hundred bucks I’ll carry couple decades retire, too. Can't increase positive cases stop testing. also obviously means deaths go away. hoping addictions minor withdrawals then? Bold move SA... Yet it’s ok send kids school! It’s pure facts ya seeeeee good news numbers say enough vaccines first batch

And well comes vaccination feel like big thing we’re missing lot people schedule testing sessions etc we’re always working test shortage. But, 100 million doses already urgency factor place feel like you’re basically going get called get vaccinated rather voluntarily won’t working shortage like tests

It’s hypotheticals ya know? sense Oxfords vaccine approved (if it’s approved) urgency kick distributed much quicker Oh get high horse probably someone claims racism waitress got order wrong Propaganda I’ve heard vaccine Trump holding right election use sort Big Win right voting. didn’t buy first seeing report day China Russia already inoculating government officials, military teachers seems plausible now. don’t put past withhold something perceived political gain however faulty logic may seem sane person. get tested go see them? really? 

In clinical sense? so?

Dr. Tam initially said wasn’t recommended people weren’t ill wear masks, back March real fear hospitals could run masks- said healthy people wash hands social distance possible. 

Obviously us getting massive shipments masks feasible provided everyone, “guidance” gone window. don’t think ever heard dangerous “official” channels.

Either way, it’s same, person virus wearing mask, mask help stop transmission. you’re sick, wear mask, people around aren’t wearing one, transmission risk still pretty high. Masks don’t work, kind do, they’re kind best want semblance normal life. wear go! Lots scrap spare parts sell tear down. That's Harleys good for.

Let virus run course forcing people wear mask today change nothing long term covid still around years now. That's point. That's pretty stupid second statement. reason COVID becomes widespread open anything involves level interaction making spread easy, schools. open anything up? Thinking effectively operate school families children things put everyone risk plain dumb. can't hold school way keep control level require schools close within 2 weeks opening. Kids grow rate. like toddlers, learn talk fast, others not, walking that's perfectly normal. Also proposing like all. American families start day 8am come home till 6 so, kid pretty much alone morning till last hours day. unlike you, third week see them, always.  live near major hospital area outbreak. Helicopters day long. definitely less 200M dead Americans next six months. Virus BLM? [colleges  “Hold bath salts” even watch video? Like said want opinion changed. remember people telling me, buy masks low supply. remember people telling me, wearing mask helps others helps me. remember Fauci (or scientist) telling me, masks work all.

Who gives shit ""people"" telling can't remember? came said masks work day does't regret please: provide actual quote actual lie Fauci told Februar/March.

Another employee came work covid symptoms husband tested positive, said needs man come work. Locally, needed, yes. large confidence interval immediately outside training range suggests model choice largely fits noise, rather underlying trend. Medical experts around world warning wearing mask embolden relax social distancing. importance wearing mask much less social distancing. could keep going fund schools federal instead state level. Equally per student. Virtually everything within reasonable driving distance nyc expensive too. US going shut again? Seems like we're getting worse here... makes sense. would rather see per capita information judge widespread risk is. understand trend info also useful. Assessing risk alone enough - must well, healthily. Understanding *simply surviving* enough.

Masking isn’t going away, it’s new normal going forward. many apologists thread, completely ignoring countries handling well 'mask shortage'. totally correct. like there's shortage decadent food, calorific food plain junk food options.

I'm Karen. work Urgent Care Center. 3 years ago September virus transmitted mostly teens appeared. prime symptoms dry, unproductive coughs diarrhea. cough long-lasting (2 months). Patients asthma COPD adversely effected often hospitalized. Hospitals reported pneumonia patients, despite way ahead normal flu/pneumonia season. 

I contracted virus result unmasked exposure. Symptoms appeared 24 hours exposure became progressively worse within 2 weeks. Peak 1 month slow steady decrease 2 months. 

At time identified ""an unidentified virus"". one made attempt research it. would amazing someone result attempted identification virus. Think September, 2017. So, links sent different types coercion, going pretend experts wrong right Dictionary dot com.

But fairness, data even point verified said originally. cloth mask fuck protect you.

HOWEVER. dampening air momentum makes less likely infect around you. Studies verified data backed point. mind partially wrong there's verifiable benefit.

So right long term, even though generally absolute prick comments.

TB whole also far deadly H1N1 look initial breakouts also far deadly. actually still kills 1.5 million people world wide year. 

H1N1 (the Spanish flu) killed roughly 675k people one year US alone time US population 103 million. 

COVID19 killed estimated 150k people country 330 million people. numbers currently include lot deaths ""with"" ""from"" along roughly 25% undiagnosed. According first study done acute respiratory illness ""Acute respiratory infections (ARIs), disease group includes pneumonia, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), responsible 4.25 million deaths year, according first-ever Acute Respiratory Infections Atlas (ARIAtlas.org), published today World Lung Foundation"".  Given 4.25 million die respiratory illness year, seems pretty strange add ton undiagnosed respiratory deaths counts. saying they're wrong, saying numbers flux accurate now.

If know kool-aid drinking hardcore republicans, ask sesame street, specifically.  go talk would NEVER allow children watch leftist show tolerance, good others.  wish joking. 
 

one Elmo talked one guys originally Children’s Television Workshop originally, said whole purpose Sesame Street cater black Hispanic youths don’t reading literature house…if go Sesame Street website, talked ‘when you’re bringing child, make sure use gender neutral language. Make sure give boys dolls make sure give girls hand, lot Stockholmers city still Stockholm county (in Roslagen) Södermanland would go back city needed test. Drinking heavily shown increase immunity. Interesting point. left leaning government Canada even conservative provincial premiers federal Conservative party board following science. 

Americans Canadians seem similar culturally Covid really shown fundamental difference individual freedom vs collective good. 

We doubters anti-maskers much minority general wear mask it’s good every own. 11,000 die, America? I'm guessing USA? seen United States? words father: “Trump runs US like business, country.” government billions dollars they're choosing use differently. Viewed optimistically cynically NBA using resources take steps keep players healthy long term. Freudian slip, maybe. media. coworker said yesterday doesn’t know believe, keeps reading articles stating lot tests false positives, knows someone who’s it, still suffering symptoms still. wants trust president like always done think also realizes isn’t hasn’t handled correctly. Classic - [Won't get fooled mortgage 3br/2ba home around $850 month. know people manage live big cities insane rent prices. boils money point. explains theres high amounts covid impoverished areas seem think big city thing.

I know similar people. degree they're correct. farmers they're exactly around crowds day. Even around many people.

Schools reopening end though. It'll congregate rural kids, they'll spread other, bring home. safe-ish rural areas probably going hit hard within month. large companies generally self insure hiring Blue Cross another insurer manage accounts. allows count insurance capital liquid asset (like pensions), charge employees whatever rate choose calling benefit.

Its scam. originally went college teaching degree. went college originally started teachers college super well known region incredible education program.

I dropped one year bc realized patience deal children day everyday.

I’m happy made decision. fucking happy. Well drive thru sites closed im sure factors like reporting reasons cases lower.  ""There many vaccines trial, couple final stage clinical trials - hope. mean vaccine, least speed reached level reached unprecedented,"" said.

There countless small towns exist seasonal residents. subsidize schools lots community things. town year round pop 3500 ballooned 9000 summer.

Yes, still ""thin"" eat junk food time. ""healthy?"" No. deemed nonobese. weekend reporting Stockholm well. probably right Stockholm fairly empty right now. think effects growing immunity population though. Trump Republicans, genius Florida man says, “I can’t take money die employer, I’m gonna take you... you... you... you...” Could deduce Swedish model correct model. anyone Sweden describe overall tactics deployed public? social distancing, mask wearing? pubs restraunts open? I'm curious  hate here. absolutely correct, 2 days rest better disease Glad skeptical monstrous claims. Trump confronted journalists granting approval Twitter &amp; do? ~ said spectacular doctor &amp; left abruptly like always presented truth. national response doomed us. one times states United. sad sect population acted way did.

Heh, certainly like live edge :D less time prepare plan  2 huge reasons this:

* US (lack of) Leadership. Trump one biggest reasons this
* Disinformation media, CDC beginning pandemic. fully believe Americans told March wear masks given valid reasons so, could avoided. 

A lot Americans problem believing first thing read certain topic, forming opinion letting opinion stand. instance, people still believe Steele Dossier true years later even though numerous stories come otherwise. age 'first reports trump truths.' fuckers slowing drug reform. Weed killed single person singe dawn time. fact smoking biologically impossible od weed. Nixon self suckered cunt wanted arrest black people, hav entire generation convinced weed heroine thing thing is, lot people underlying conditions. even undiagnosed hiding. plenty Americans, especially South, overweight obese. comforting try tell oneself victims virus underlying conditions. rarity.

Unemployed parents losing substantial expanded unemployment benefits:

Bottom line. Families, Parents, AMERICANS support government crucial time. hope.  Anybody considers Disney part identity probably bonkers. wife’s cousin routinely flies 3 day getaway, leaves two daughters (around 5 2) behind home. can’t even imagine amount money costs, she’s maybe 7 times last 12 months. live Maryland What. The. Actual. Fuck. Oh, no, no, wrong, stop. going year, even people 100% compliant mandates. going dealing crap years years. Even 100% people “played rules”, virus going away. Quit whining. doesn’t help. severely misinformed. Fair comment immunity lasts long enough stop transmission long enough stop second third wave outright.

If, however, lasts couple months (highly unlikely totally excluded) may find lifting restrictions protection community disappears. Similarly, would probably want re-protect people vaccinated first round complete roll-out lower risk groups.

To great extent mitigated continuing research past bare minimum establishing worthwhile effectiveness meaningful, yet short period - i.e., need establish basic safety, plus months' potential firebreak vaccine roll out. Means probably know drink. Exactly right imagine government expecting restaurants venues able maintain social distancing clients. Also rise cases necessarily mean situation comparable lockdown periods. tests done, infections found sooner admissions hospitals down. We'll need worry if/when situation control, daily cases go up. think get point though downvoted it. People cared locked months frustrated right effort seems vain. sacrificed see millions fellow Americans acting like life usual. technically even second wave since many people states blew infection rate soaring.

if government going push national lockdown want see government step aggressively control behaviors care. need strong federal leadership create comprehensive national response instead hodgepodge like now. said 2019-2020. 2018 it?
Also 280 definitely underestimate. deaths listed caused pneumonia likely due flu. people part executive branch government. It’s pretty awful representation country main question, people live outside Sweden, happy lock measures?
If happy, ok.
If happy, maybe could change law obtain power government.

Stay safe. seem entirely separate concerns one raised earlier. Covid might thing prevents re-election Trump. geopolitical consequences US collapsing would probably make covid deaths look like bargain comparison.  Expensive damn lesson though. vast majority Americans – 96% – cellphone kind. (June 2019)

[I’m sure 3 percentage points *far showed another 32 158 staff also infected.

Curious something, Norway, right? masks-are-not-necessary. crew passengers wear masks? developed countries comparable infection rates schools reopen August without making difference? Parents students made tremendous sacrifices. government didn’t job asked make more. don’t give. lot fresh faces political offices elections. fired. LOL FUCK GUY [See rule say marrige stupid, definitely list, showcase goverment giving fuck. makes different trump. Married immigrant too? mean tests take 14-16 days results places?

You turd. entire point since things ok canada us fully open. Claiming bars schools restaurants open full capacity. many cases plainly true all. think everything 25€ schools open 25% too?

Got mobile goalposts like initial argument?

Piss losers smarter director CDC? Y’all love/trust/worship “experts“ tell something contradicts personal believes/what read online.

Again, director fucking CDC. knows guys. aren’t smarter him, stop. Disney even letting open? WTF. Also, EVERY SINGLE PERSON thats vaccinated removes spread vector. People hate protests hate bring Minnesota New York, please keep up. I’m also able live pretty safe life compared many. vaccine needs go essential workers first. Obviously medical folks also grocery store employees retail employees. people forced interact public entire time. ✋  Hashtag Dawn Planet Atheists last part might much lower priority, 100s thousands lives could saved expediating roll-out 2nd 3rd wave, even immunity lasts year two. vaccine distributed widely general risk infection also begins drop. get vaccine spring average young person that’s absolutely fine. 

It’s funny, watched Contagion yesterday first time since came impressed real felt we’re living pandemic, sort laughed lucky vaccine start distributed 135 days however long took. know movie involves really smart scientists discovering breakthroughs critically early one testing vaccine themselves, still, got vaccine success scene like “ALREADY?” Well, somehow claiming able identify “a scandal” even though you’re qualification reading article online. guess smarter everybody else. totals make absolutely sense, god knows China 

China's death total might order magnitude higher, unlikely that. cases fit pattern nations successfully implemented lockdowns tt&amp;i. ""The number deaths coronavirus Iran nearly triple Iran's government claims, BBC Persian service investigation found.

Yeah vaccine last year made feel little sick 48 hours. that’s totally normal. concern vaccine actually works. opposite surely?

If you’ve already you’ll probably degree natural immunity back queue vs people haven’t immunity future infection. conflicting information masks “experts“ presented us last months, shouldn’t calling anyone “stupid“. don’t know masks actually work,wearing masks new flavor month liberals desperate prove compliant much smarter “dumb Trump supporters“.

Your enthusiasm wearing masks based popular opinion “experts“, maybe people would receptive wearing masks “experts“ blatantly lied public wearing masks earlier pandemic. Don’t make excuses them, lied. Yeah shit? remember debating man maybe 2 months ago someone saying there's evidence rural infections ""blue"" states cities care? hey dont apreciate tone fuck you! Also that’s pretty normal vaccine isn’t it? I’ve definitely felt little crappy vaccines past. even need mask case absurd put independent day celebrations especially lot protest rallies happened time . I'm saying protest okay , giving news like clearly politically motivated whether left right . Update coronavirus situation UK anyone interested. 


Levels coronavirus UK pretty low minute. Deaths hospitalisations continuing trend downwards. 


Quick note deaths, published figures used comparison sites, worldometer, John Hopkins ect. misleading currently review: ignored.  


Use instead ONS death statistics come week later. Current estimates put UK death toll around 25 deaths across settings day continuing trend downwards.  


That said, local outbreaks entire city Leicester put lockdown. although cases since dropped substantially city starting move lockdown:  


More recently however, huge section northern England increased restrictions imposed upon due rise cases there:  


Additionally, new positive cases rise UK, 550 day 3-4 weeks ago 750 day today. also testing enough, positivity rate 0.6%.

On top ONS infection survey (which uses statistical random sampling estimate many people coronavirus community) recently confirmed infections rising:  


As result lockdown easings postponed:

In short pretty OK minute although may start new surge. ""century self"" happened.. Paywall. 😒 Kind impossible evaluate without knowing corrected for. Eye catching summary. Lead author extensive research history. Color skeptical. I’m scared, really scared. government acting like petulant children.

They acted like every time important vote comes since, what, 2008? People never noticed much concern group. time people hurt include people across demographics. Grabbing torch leg dipshit-state relay race? tables turned eh lol Unfortunately anymore, read couple weeks ago. remember, inflammation bout virus results lot abnormalities, go away vast majority people recover viral infection. absolutely concerned possible symptoms disease. also need alarmist stoke irrational fear.  Years ago got last MMR vaccine TDaP, one shoulder. wound soreness injection site felt like knot skin days.

But guess what? I'll even take repeat contracting COVID. 80% people receiving vaccine show symptoms virus Scarfologist  Could be? be! mean get back stands sporting event? mean anti-maskers getting vaccine sounds like bit stetch.

Once vaccine developed, decided whether similar polio vaccine make free least really really affordable? want see vaccine sold like insulin, costs hundreds reach many people! guess depends industry. Imagine sports, travel, restaurants, even gyms... closed atm, least crowds. Trump control data real facts coming out. Cases dropping everyday! CDC fake species defective. cloth masks fitted properly

This correct, even masks simple metal nosepiece substantially solve problem. buy wear one top fact transmitted extended exposure quick walkby.

I give shit person passing several feet sidewalk wearing mask. care put one go office building book/gun/grocery/camping/clothing store I'm inside also missed people hand wash garments.

Do people problem sink running water, soap next it? difficult thing people learn.

For us mid-life, emptying part (or all) retirement funds get unemployed right now. We're panned younger cheaper labor/graduates, lot less time recover financially, little hope saving comfortable retirement, short living government, funding even exists 10-20 year's time.

Edit: Unless talking something like, requiring pass saying got vaccine get certain businesses things. might ok that. problem rapid tests, antibody antigen, inaccurate. get good reading would need test person multiple times several days. give false sense security people drive poor behavior well. 

Right getting test feeling sick exposed. means isolating anyway. social distancing well. test tells covid something else. That's it. anyone using IMO. 

Here's problem testing general. Even PCR testing miss window someone sick. Lets say someone gets test today. 5 days results come back negative. person may low viral load. 5 days spiked sick, test says Negative. 

No test protocol going save country. indicator likely presence virus, population testing area. used planners order morgue trucks direct policy. 

What works staying home, staying away people able wearing right PPE. 

The governments rolled dice decided rather hand money us, citizens, shut enable proper distancing allowing virus burn out. willing let portion us die economy crash worse. 

Everyone needs understand money chosen people. one coming save us. start acting like it. 

Testing preventative. Testing save us. Getting test make feel safe negative.

As per wiki:
The myth flat Earth modern misconception European scholars educated people Middle Ages believed Earth flat rather spherical.


The famous ""Flat Earth"" Flammarion engraving originates Flammarion's 1888 L'atmosphère: météorologie populaire (p. 163)
The earliest documentation spherical Earth comes ancient Greeks (5th century BC). Since 600s AD, scholars supported view, Early Middle Ages (700–1500 AD), virtually scholars maintained spherical viewpoint.

Since 1400s, belief flat Earth among educated Europeans almost nonexistent. despite fanciful depictions art, exterior panels Hieronymus Bosch's famous triptych Garden Earthly Delights, disc-shaped Earth shown floating inside transparent sphere.

According Stephen Jay Gould, ""there never period 'flat Earth darkness' among scholars, regardless public large may conceptualized planet now. Greek knowledge sphericity never faded, major medieval scholars accepted Earth's roundness established fact cosmology."" Historians science David Lindberg Ronald Numbers point ""there scarcely Christian scholar Middle Ages acknowledge [Earth's] sphericity even know approximate circumference"".

* 37 patients currently ICU COVID-19 across country. 270 patients hospitalized departments. numbers still going longer period time.
* week report weeks ending week 30 (20-26 July) published Friday, link translated excerpts read here: 

Few notes previous week:

* [Statistics Sweden released new update preliminary death ; shows Sweden normal mortality rate since 11th July excess mortality compared 2015-2019 order 4950 deaths period 1/3 18/7.
* [The Board Health Welfare also released new update COVID-19 deaths based death ; finds 5527 COVID-19 deaths occurred 1/3 18/7 90% also included reports Public Health Authority. period FHM reports 5690 deaths. Note difference based FHM reports deaths people confirmed COVID-19 past 30 days, regardless cause death.
* Last week 30 total 59143 PCR tests performed 1376 confirmed cases based these. puts current positivity ratio 2.3%, lower previous week's 3.2% 3.4% week that. However total number tests performed also lower - previous weeks 69k 81k accordingly. lowering tests might connected main supplier Stockholm region halving deliveries past weeks. data available . Good visualization development numbers tests, confirmed tests positive ratio pandemic seen [on Twitter .
* Wednesday 20 28 reported deaths backdated month back. seems due report single region ( Östergötland ) reported deaths since June official reports FHM.

&amp;#x200B;

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Useful links:

* Good visualization information per regions english - ; similar source information intensive care statistics swedish graphs lag information deaths/hospitalization/cases per Socialstyrelsen (Board Health Welfare), publishes (weekly) parallel statistics based death certificates, include people diagnosed tested Corona excludes people died reasons COVID-positive; also information elderly homes social housing statistics related COVID19. similar. lots ways.

Since US standard living compared places like those?  Well terms evidence chest X ray/CT best bet actually train AI high accuracy. used china diagnose target treatment patients (I think many even story sub it). 

As far much ambiguity could eliminated hard say exactly. would say tho moment extreme end scale. adding deaths toll without regard actually died from. would lead suspect t.he death rate lower reported many places difference likely significant.
More measures seperate deaths undoubtedly help transparency. 

Unfortunately due nature situation always ambiguous area. someone already pneumonia contracting virus on. aim reduce ambiguity much possible removing obvious outliers. main request would try remove death toll confidently say die covid using simple tests/protocols like one above.

* .1% apparently really low. action, like wearing single layer cloth mask reduces 70%, 100% ""Why bother amirite?""

* understand science process. Yes, scientists said something yesterday contradicts say today. dumb ignorant corrupt. new knowledge result new behaviors.

* treat every individual life circumstance own. Many us can't stay home, can't quarantine, can't go dangerous job.

3.Check temps door school means parent walks front door maintaining social distance.If child parent fever kid goes home virtual learning time prove fever free test negative Covid along whole family.

4.All staff school gets tested least 1 time week.

5.Masks required everyone every day.

Professor Robert Dingwall, researcher Nottingham Trent University, told Express.co.uk: “There point wearing face masks don’t protect [There's run surgical masks US coronavirus scare. need them, physicians [Dr Margaret Harris said masks may protect people germs - protect [Coronavirus: Public wearing masks 'cosmetic, effective' - UK [Why mask protect Wuhan [People racing buy face masks amid coronavirus outbreak, probably protect Chris Smith, consultant virologist Cambridge University, told RNZ people buy instead save spend something useful enjoy doing, like beer. face masks absolute rubbish nothing.""

- [Wuhan coronavirus: face masks 'do nothing' - nuance exactly said. everyone, every country saying exact thing.

And key change acceptance asymptomatic/ presymptomatic spread significant, mass mask wearing important stop wearer spreading someone else.

But communication terrible, frankly bit Western hubris intellectual snobbery going think issue, prevalent public health advice many Asian countries was, everyone wear masks. dozens, less every country want.. don’t think public schools public school teachers prepared handle online learning. They’re already people systems set private companies handle that. 

If you’re giving feedback individual test you’re clearly prepared online learning. Pretty sure saw something 3~ days ago virus started spreading Florida's villages... fairly dense communities mostly retired /older individuals. Previously lot communities like villages fairly isolated that's longer true.

Most suburban areas seeing increases due people socially distancing, wearing masks, gathering groups despite warnings. shame. like spent much effort insulting me, manage provide actual quote (or meaningful information matter)

Someone else provide quote, seem one referring here, Fauci say ""Masks work all"", like keep insisting. 

So let ask 4th time: exactly say? care? may right see. Maybe assholes country open eyes realize masks violation liberties rather entirety government. blows mind stupid blind are. Virginia upgraded state law make primary offense, could charged caught stopped something else, now. perspective, still much issue tackled. nightly news handled.  Right principal. Lots people also lost health insurance, therefore aren’t going doctors check things cost. described experience US media, tbh. reason seeing videos hospital corona wards, get enough advertising dollars worthwhile. outbreaks, we’d likely hear it. One student caught virus high-school band trip Disney/Uní back spring made news. guys universal health care right? already way ahead American retail workers. probably paid better too. I'm sure happier based two things alone. furries wear fursuits. Furries people love (either platonically sexually) antropomorphic animals (not mixed actual animals). want antropomorphic animals themselves, not. do, rich enough buy fursuit (they cost thousands way). people also tend active furries, completely overshadow live normal lives degeneracy. Whenever see rental payment two bedroom one bathroom 750 sq ft city apartment going considerably 3 bedroom 3 bathroom 2400 sq ft home 2.5 acres mortgage, insurance, property taxes included rural NE, always wonder people living city commute take job outside city. seems like paying large premium city life complaining paying large premium city life. get great able walk dozen great restaurants live within walking distance art museum theater district, that's worth paying $4-5k month live closet, live somewhere $4-5 month live closet? seems there's large group people want certain lifestyle fighting finite number housing units drives housing costs complain lifestyle decisions made expensive somehow injustice. move lower cost living area? sister moved NC public school teachers buy 4 bdrm, 3 bath houses $225k. 

I agree $3,200 month one bedroom apartment ludicrous. question is, move somewhere cost $3,200 month? last apartment outside city 15 minute commute town. Wife laid $1050 two bed 1 bath. Everyone else knew lived city two minutes walking commute downtown paid $2,200 $3k. Nobodys holding gun peoples head forcing live expensive cities. Same. Even mid sized Texas town living in, protesters wearing masks. ones wearing them!

I think folks like bring protests it’s another reason shit social justice. Lol no. Even Tsai Ing Wen POTUS America would still effed.

America full people culturally American: selfish, narcissistic, extreme individualist, pathological contrarians.

If America culture valued high IQ, secularism, STEM education, introversion, agreeability, conscientiousness, collectivism, could survive Trump. don’t live Florida, 40% chance thunderstorms today cancelled testing events area due pending bad weather. Coincidentally, I’m sure, biggest spikes cases I’ve ever seen testing pulled back “thunderstorms”. It’s 40% chance. chance rain almost every day. rains 1 4. wasn’t Dude...you've lost...it's over. Feel free look definition coercion MW, Dictionary.com, etc., none make argument legitimate. know talking got caught. simple. advised give masks hospitals front line workers yall stay home 3 weeks.

You needed one listened stayed home.

He lie. underestimated American exceptionalism stupidity. Herd mentality faux intellectualism churned colleges universities. May well Matrix. I'm hurting anyone want think pandemic,

See thing people know infectious.  know hurting others.  think get easily spread others kill them. Ppl forget increased burden American foster care (I kid). Add quarantine fact nobody wants take teens (I get it) lots orphans. also taxes gov funds pay stipend foster parents. Fun fact: sometimes money never goes towards foster kids... good thing. bought years actually invest infrastructure reduce gridlock traffic picks again. Can’t blame Trump every disaster, especially happening liberal controlled states cities. Like LA Cali. Ain’t Trump’s fault brah. True. I’m pretty sure majority bailed out.  It’s going fascinating terrifying year. Murdered words... *delicately* think USA numbers low, decent ball park. Southern definitely suspicious. 

I always figured Iran hiding lot. 

I imagine China hidden some, never trust data totalitarian regime, don’t think it’s order magnitude worse (10x) would pretty hard hide. And, way convincing people follow orders. 

But, way really knowing without leaks good data. 

Epidemiologists US get truth eventually, excess deaths attributed Covid data available. lot schools time limit long certain credits good, might possible students wanted arrest anti-war protesters well. folks country demeaned silly Hippies wanting kill poor folks Southeast Asia. Marijuana LSD included Schedule One get folks well even though knew perfectly well since Shafer Commission marijuana safe. Nixon like findings Commission. Maybe much vandalized/destroyed angry rioters fighting capitalism name uh...Karl Marx? People 2019: ""The world going end soon! Believe us!""
People 2020: ""Muh freedom! conspiracy supress us""

You can't make up. shouldn’t take comparison 150,000 Americans already DEAD. Never coming back. 150,000 mothers, fathers brothers sisters doctors nurses everyday people country loves aren’t able even mourn honor respect enemy government hardly even acknowledges deaths pretends didn’t even happen. Denying deaths proof virus crime humanity leader didn’t could stop innocent citizens dying blood hands. wouldn’t call mistake. Stupidity get away easy point. responsible. allowed fold COVID? installed months back never actually ended working COVID project. Trump visible symptom, cherry top pile shit American right.  makes much clearer thank Eh poor policy planning defeated America. Simply using blood thinners decreases risk dying covid-19 substantially. 

In addition, screening medical personal hart, lung conditions sensitivity vascular disease could also help prevent deaths.

Having said this. man undeniable courage. Lots wrong statement, fortune tellers example, let's title LITERAL STATISTIC. misunderstood meant, idiot.

Do think average healthy person die covid? title lacking specifics suggest people like you. seems case here. Maybe could update statement say ""a lot people comorbidities"". Right on. Thank you.  lot Ontario like unless sparking right front cop numb. Shoving way survive. ""Plagues"" hahaha. like made joke headline. Nationen lunatics. eb.dk's comment section.

Nationen preferred social media danish extreme right wing individuals, find lunatics irrelevant. 

That **The Danish Industry Association ordered masks made Uighur slavelabour Friday**, irrelevant. cousin nurse here. plenty masks time.

Anecdotal arguments irrelevant. 

Danish news already documented danish nurses tending covid19 patients sometimes nothing except splash-masks. neighbour friend doctor works covid, hard hit cases . Novody sent home.

Ooooohhhhhhh, *cousin* *neighbour knows doctor* way know everything happens country's hospitals without even duty reading newspapers 🤣

As said, yet explain human decide send senior covid19 symptoms back nursing home full seniors, getting test results. 

But besides fact neighbour told never happened, actually care sociopath understand wrong you. need believe random stuff see pn Facebook. Remember anybody computer write anything want pass news.

You must spend lot time Facebook since assume everyone same. Remember old enough vote read news everyday, makes danger society probably limit influence since honestly care handle responsibility. kid watch tik tok create gibberish wordwalls places like Facebook really kid opinion carries value people asking serious questions politics pandemic. Kids think internet makes possible join adult debate without anybody noticing kids. 

Fact Denmark success handling pandemic, danish authorities report deaths **unless** within 30 days. 

Your word-wall denial here, really anything display mind, living country simply applying makeup numbers waiting countries make vaccines &amp; OP could really lived happily without uninformed claims south Denmark fine. 

Besides uninformed, lacking, personal character, replying something ""south denmark"" question like OP, replying ""*my back yard garden free corona*"" wanted picture Denmark success story handling pandemic, still said anyway. Incredible self-indulgent, undereducated together lacking character needed world. This. It’s lot trouble people correlating protests. every single protester saw NYC larger protests mask on. Ever seen episode Tiger King talk homeboy served patrons employees?

Let's say code. That’s debatable based people’s beliefs. Rebel sound health advice, kill yourself! **/s** states US allow riding motorbike without helmet? thats get ants. George? Personally love living country allegedly first world slipping sliding every day Oh sorry, aware individually responsible containing covid-19. amen.

i retail one holiday season. never, ever again. think there's probably huge number people, maybe even majority, ""underlying condition"" sort know about. got cold kept coughing really long time passed; one could really tell happened doctor thought could mild level asthma never really noticeable. good shape really healthy far knew.

It's naive anyone think worry supposedly underlying conditions. Nobody given real answer. real answer legal. Many states laws state leaving kids home alone (under certain age) valid reason children taken done child endangerment. kids could perfectly well-behaved safe, neighbor attitude problem call cops say leave children unattended got DCFS asshole months years. problem getting lenders take hit. Repubs Dems, want add stuff side doesnt want. 34,200 US deaths 2018-2019 flu season. 157k covid US. Stop spreading false information. next 20 days? 20 days, it’s September coming! Prepare double triple number! feel case lot places schools around nation start opening up. really hits home sirens keep hearing suburb finally arrive neighbor’s house. Captain Tripps stay. yeah let’s go back school! think talking viral pandemic, headline include word ""immune"" unless specifically reporting biological immunity following infection. loaded word right now, especially constant reporting couple people gotten covid once. People afraid infection spent drive immunity virus say 'no one immune' inappropriate least. Redditors largely ""intelligent"" white middle class males came households repeatedly praised smart. actually don’t seem wear masks anymore since aren’t cases. Yeah, thats really messed up! people mansions land isolate easily. bet parties thats get covid. go store anything like deal public transportation. everything delivered well. course, parties want add ridiculous shit relief bill line pockets. You’re right. remember skimming knew nothing definite passed both. also remember wondering Senate would put forward own, rather one House passed. thinking one Senate Republicans put forward. ""my"" GDP LOL. Regardless, clear communist poor nation makes populace easy control? would’ve ""communist nation"" private sector making 42.1% GDP 2018? definition communism subscribe too?

Half argument Vietnam communist nation poster contests. think anyone debates Vietnam poor.

However, brought anything regarding COVID responses relation public policy anything said propaganda.

So yeah, I'm going ""debunk"" (it's even worth calling guess since actually statement willing stand behind since might actual opinion) random facts relevant conversation.

I mean, go too:

Vietnam 37 million motorbikes. Debunk that. can't, guess we're right COVID. many previous predictions come true?  Yep. Health code thing. thing happens law. Fuck uproar. Closed permanently. seems...incredibly dumb. dont breathe ventilator. ventilator you. there's nothing since there's policy place. Profits staff patients need context specific lie Fauci told public. 

What exactly say? see would get hand then

No one could foresee anti mask movement, big would get. can’t control idiots doing. That’s point. feels like something done us. Well fair teachers don’t create tax base they’re actually drain economy bunch takers taking care educating future generations, selfish really. first succeed... hope morons affected. Yes, exactly nuance missed many. protests cause significant spikes people outdoors mostly wearing masks. However, government condoning sent message many following rules essentially (or least could relax behaviors significant degree). Especially lockdown fatigue, easily could tipping point. worth, agree protests agree government support them, inevitable outcome decision. sit outside chair read book, there's sun  Rents aren’t really down. They’re offering free months ‘net effective’ down. They’re keeping actual monthly rates case MtA property management company. anymore. lifted April? Around timeframe. all. NZ ~5 million. USA ~328 million. cant breathe mask hooked oxygen machine buddy. Probably nothing constant riots. No, Saskatchewan. little known province direct dead centered covered USofA. getting hordes US travellers, jump single digits (8 9 per day), 50/60 day. huge population Hutterite communities, outbreak affecting 17 communities scattered across province. higher per capita rate infection anywhere else Canada. watch go down. politician/premier coward doesnt face facts, opened lake resort properties getting initial hit, trying redirect anger school boards. promised open schools ""no matter what"", schools funding cut efforts two years straight.

Anyways, rant over. Sorry, directed you. Just... incredibly frustrated. difference kids top kids worst slum country poor kids face consequences actions rich girls get gang raped nicer houses. Amazon rain Forrest fire target worse last year... Siberia also facing record fires... whose ready WaterWorld? Cultural differences - although I’d say sisters raise managed (American). Typical reopen sophistry. Literally 0 orders US prevented people going outdoors. Instead, people arguing restaurants, malls, retail, offices needed reopened muh immune system.  100% Dems largely adopt Repub bill. ticks much organized group people would. even cast members, people work gas stations, hotels, restaurants, car rental places, gift shops, tourist traps around Disney. area massive catered tourists. cluster fuck know people need jobs due busted unemployment system Florida, god feel like way state going get control fudging numbers. US living least common denominator years. Laws prevent actions minority fools intelligent common sense choice damned. Convenience store clerk 68 year old man. “ see ID?” Like said, I'm specialist. talk experience. us kinda normal guess.

Though probably right. environment worked ""well"". Might work well America. Different culture, values mindsets. Cases deaths per 1 million much, much lower countries, daily increase cases already flat increase restrictions likely start decreasing now. actual 7 day average based way every state country determines percent positivity around 19%... really really helps force people wait 7 days work done /u/ishkoten

They deserve ton credit.. don’t traditional fasting. choose one thing give 21 days. Like sweets, television, social media, something like nothing gets closer god give KitKats 3 weeks  IDK, letting mail sit abundance caution barely low grade crazy. He's eating faces smearing feces running around outside making airplane noises. generations could get whipped frenzies charismatic white dudes go war/commit genocides etc? Hey! Florida start person week. Kids come back next week. Thankfully husband young healthy, I’m still scared. I'm sure there's microphone equipped masks there. they're currently developed. Correct. I'll admit know almost Jack shit vaccines, except basics accepted medical community (completely pro Vax, science mask, case needs said), thought vaccines took FOREVER find safe successful series.

How possible less year think figured out, gotten human trials study effects, almost ready?

Genuine question, someone explain? Good, think testing shut down, hurricane? didn’t tell stay home interact anyone either. They’re giving vaccine 15,000 people placebo 15,000 people. They’re assuming people large group statistically behave way. super careful stay home, totally careless go bars, leave house work, etc etc. would support requirement? We've lost 150,000 citizens become unable travel anywhere 4 countries outside US now. keep going half million dead blame Democrats even more.

The way politicized deplorable unconscionable. know person charge conscience ...

VOTE OUT, LOCK UP. Affluent people necessarily science literate. order magnitude more. That’s gotta harrowing endure got different lungs rest us? Get fucked. people’s lives work closing, employees losing jobs, 

He's addressing macroeconomic point US 70% consumer based spending. country's infrastructure rots import everything, citizens mostly engaged selling stuff, cooking food other, personal services. think are. can't even manufacture distribute PPE adequate testing 6 months knew needed it, expect roll vaccine handled much better, least current people charge. Let's hope get real one. one I'm ordering says 3m it. prob! sign waivers medical service ignoring pandemic common sense. curious. assume one got sick 1918, account everyone wearing masks? surprise! ominous sign week ahead. Today’s fatality count yet another increase last Sunday, usually indicates rest week also increase previous week. alone bad sign, hoping past week would peak.

However, today increase despite Hidalgo County (TX), almost California (only LA, Orange, three small counties reported), many large states altogether reporting fatality counts all. today increase despite could painful week. still love Doug Pederson beat Patriots, gave Eagles first Superbowl. wonder much rest team it? Pederson pre existing conditions? Well, exactly do. Maybe need re-read it. *SIGH* 

I HATE HUMANITY Honestly don’t even care test counts anymore. want death counts intubated people tracked.

Testing, lack testing, people thinking need test... irrelevant. numbers trust confirmed Covid deaths intubations/ICU beds needed. Can’t fake those. need worse that. need hold owners criminally liable willfully spreading virus likely causing suffering and/or deaths patrons. husband Daegu. also lived year, yes seems quiet city. miss lot nowadays name Rona DeathSantis.  God. Hopefully pray away like miracle coronavirus gone Amen comment share agree! Like believe! RemindMe! 2 weeks don’t report = don’t any. Magic! Every area different set things get vaccinated for. Public Health makes determination part medical clearance process.  team still played dont want get rona sure seem want to. Afghanistan dawg. They’re millions stopped testing say pneumonia killing sick old people apparently. So, tells took it, good enough? Gotta ask, is? horrible give placebos. looking rates infection vs control group. That's determine efficiency admit, much (not sports person) didn’t think organized sports seemed like good idea right now, didn’t expect *so many* athletes get sick fast. It’s nonstop news feeds, don’t bother posting don’t recognize names. (Like one article. sports person.) known long time. 

In Wuhan people got coronavirus tests kept separate people waiting results, especially families. That's [this built ten days. either full shit ill absolutely leaving house reason midst pandemic.

Let’s pretend aren’t full shit genuinely can’t breathe wearing mask. means lungs breathing abilities compromised virus would certainly kill you. terrified going without mask even terrified coming anywhere near people wearing mask. Clearly aren’t terrified either given think one wear mask. Therefore proved full shit. Q.E.D may great vaccine small selloff one individual could ploy cause huge panic selloff. friends swoop buy undervalued stock, release great vaccine, make bank. WTF love Fascism now! Wa wa wa waaaaa. bad one care. They’re trending right direction. gave Democrat senator removed confederate statues state Lol yeah, that's Florida......they one worst education systems United States Yeah take world whole become normal. think it’s regional step step procedure. example, countries ordered tons doses delivery end year become normal first. eventually months bit longer rest world get point. Could wrong though. Given name Corona Karen, obvious picking fight obtuse purpose. Good day. here. actually never comfortable limit exposure ""other people"". also needed work whole thing, aware interactions others. ROI “Rules probability”

There 85% chance wrong. socially distanced, outside masks on, could maybe work. however likely rwnjs wont. Joey Vatto Reds sent home possable COVID 19 symptoms also. Good. Guys, respect virus, fear it. 

Imagine scary would look tracked flu cases deaths worldometer; common cold coronaviruses. 

Respect it, fear it. Pass on. kids might also stuck youth pastors church members? Even conservative say 94% mega churches hiding pedo problem somewhere....That's many confessions...  large percentage teachers call sick, fire them? think would work them? always better promise deliver. Nobody ever got mad got something really wanted sooner expected. Nah us, them. Let kill want till vaccine arrives. Fuck em. honestly dont care. let die. Hope kind hedge inflation... feel dizzy lightheaded wear them? halitosis make uncomfortable wear mask?

I fucking hate place. dont believe manage pandemic year. Maybe early spring best 2021. mean don’t wear mask you’re kinda asking it. sayin wonder many years life lost see got downvoted. simple logic considering know virus spreads. virtually guaranteed spread came protests. would thought virus recognize man made boundaries Nah dawg, booster shots exist. long enough people take vaccine following booster herd immunity long enough get rid virus.

All need unified push make vaccine available Citizens free people willingly take...fuck dead. Might well live life then. ""Pivoting"" business plan, hah. fair, Italy much lower population Christian, infuriates me. people saying God protect God bodyguard servant. yet, made abundantly clear test God.

Umm, people really cared quality life others long time. everyones personal responsibility. people actually cared others' quality life, would public healthcare privatized one like one currently USA.

It’s sad desperate. agree. There's good answer here, way turn it. people can't stay home. Homeschool lot work. Schools ill-equipped deal this. Many distance learning scenarios less ideal. Kids different needs, etc etc. Tough spot parents caregivers right now. Oh, definitely. going great day there's widely available vaccine, remember assume day vaccine comes out. We'll get eventually need understand going back normal overnight process. No, fuck that. don’t absolve Disney worse factors. I’m sick people defending favorite giant corporation.

They’ll fine. don’t need open. economic devastation climate change brings make pandemic look like practice round. hear idiots say, death rate lower south warmer humid. Like, ""oh yeah buddy? Tell fucking Brazil!""

In July August average temperature Rio de Janeiro 4 degrees Celsius / 7 degree Fahrenheit lower example Seattle... I'm HCA major FL city right now. figures specifically, tell without doubt amount covid patients walking thru ER doors ICU covid unit noticeable smaller 2 weeks ago. 

Literally every room ICU extreme precautions sign door, covid unit went single occupancy rooms June double occupancy July. back single occupancy maybe half rooms ICU (but still completely full) Almost value it’s weeks later, useful know you’ve tested positive quick turnaround isolate yourself, including housemates going work/grocery store. like knew many months ago despite republicans preening NY dipshit Birx babbling one-size fits policy. position. thought helps anyone getting sick even potentially dying conscience. Even asymptomatic cases showing heart damage. part community even though many people suck right now. whole thing taught right moral thing tough times. Trump hit much harder covid strikes lungs. Probably last weeks alive. Well thats dumb literally said masks don’t make difference $39k death toward state Medicare coffers sure deadly... actually less people could dying... immune response is. article anx research coukd shed light it, describing response. knowing change fact x% people dying.
I've heard theory nice. gives hope us catch it. *but* also fact lethal x% 100% cases gives (the same) hope.

that's all. nothing changed describing sitiation. could help dev cure treatment, ok... long ahot here.  Sample size 10000 people. used many people experiment  Like get it. I’m bit numb point (partly feeling anxious March-May). don’t know anyone that’s died gotten severely sick. feels like it’s happening people. still take seriously follow precautions. hard people do? leave *today* enter world yesterday, tomorrow, *fantasy*.... machine externally oxygenizes blood respirator enough causes blood clots forces amputations.

Also virus causes blood clots cases I've heard. data seems downturn/plateau US number confirmed cases despite hospitalizations going test positivity rates high. also makes question recent shift HHS reporting cases. Anyone thoughts?  “The doctor glanced statue Republic, said know using language reason, knew using language facts everybody could see - wasn’t necessarily thing”

Brainwashed republican. That's problem. people saying cool wish death others, I'm sitting like ""I hope least survive long enough watch stupid coworkers wait get back bars die first."" scroll end, shows explosion cases hospitalizations starts third week June; that’s 2-3 weeks protests started - know 99% infections show symptoms 14 days. It’s likely two things happened: (1) protestors spread virus (2) official sanction (and sometimes participation) protests unintentionally signaled end infection control measures. That’s 50% (or more) infections age 20-40. keep throwing around words justification fucking clue “realistic” reason believed “realistic” experts - againw trained specifically this, think realistic possible exit scenario pandemic. narcissism inflated ego ridiculous man. 21,387 samples, 'multi-stage sampling study design' usually means geographical cluster-based selection. similar survey conducted Mumbai week later, reported door door approach, assume Delhi well.

There's old correspondence indicates lot people fell ill around time kind went it, including Mahatma Ghandi Woodrow Wilson. “relaxation areas” proves aren’t smart thus. Disney open unbelievably greedy disgusting, they’re going it, masks everywhere times. 

It’s like virus says “eh, relaxation zone, let’s infect anyone.” That’s crime. :( humans deserve quality healthcare point use doesn’t utterly ruin finances. Can't speak schools seeing great chunk people country know civil war happened confederate statues built Jim crow era racist monuments, speaks volumes. America tends shy away dark moments history. Maybe changed, maybe teach better school, secret [American history taught differently state personally, recall deep dives slavery briefly touched going straight made tv version segregation. Japanese interment camps, horrors Vietnam war, trail tears, throwing democracies countries, Japanese endured atomic bomb, Tulsa race massacre. list goes on. remember college, American history lessons basically patriotic stroke jobs, ""that cool oh well"" thrown glossed over. maybe school freedom teach, maybe bad student zoned teacher discussing operation paper clip. knows. I'm saying there's currently lot people country, defending confused others worried pissed tread familiar footprints shady past. 50 millions worldwide deaths population 2 billion. Compare 2020 population 8 billion covid deaths 800,000 worldwide. even close. pandemic overblown.  Shows soft Americans become.

They think wearing mask hard enough rationally claim it’s violation freedoms?

Let introduce battle Stalingrad... depends convince voters ""failures bill"" trump's problem... IE there's politcal aspect crap.

IE StateX says ""we got treated unfairly"" say ""I agree - trump insisted it""... Tank top shorts gang rise up. don’t get conspiracy theories. data change affected hospitalization data, overall count. 

Tracking websites don’t rely CDC data this, never have. Sanders movements achieved square root fuck all. keep congratulating meanwhile real world american president Donald Trump China seems follow, all, science based approach. really wonder kind superiority complex western people operating on. news, China seems big cracking hard coronavirus. Apparently western thinking goes Chinese government wants avoid people dying protect legitimacy allegedly illegitimate authoritarian government, thus aggressive lockdowns. leave one wondering though, much legitimacy democratic government completely ready throw people buss protect short-term functioning markets economy? much akin ""We good guys, ok us bad things. good guys, all."" state income tax means Florida huge incentive reopen tourists matter human consequences. majority is, 30-50% asymptomatic 85% - 95% would classed asymptomatic mild remaining 5% requiring hospitalisation. Even talented fucking shite gamble nice.... history repeating itself....what world war came this? feel like real fight Republicans keep trying tack immunity business/employer liability COVID-19 outbreaks workplace kind new relief. course, must fought tooth nail last thing want patchwork, unenforced, confusing coronavirus prevention methods bunch employees getting sick, getting chronic condition, dying etc. able even file workers compensation claim. saw PR bots trying push claim hard there's way sending data white house could cover anything, like there's reason CDC would taken process would sent Trump white house places. absolutely awful. you, that's extremely useful insight someone saw NYC play out. I've got hang one, know I've seen news articles trying make case exactly I've hesitant make mind happened there.

I recognize findings exonorate Cuomo's plan, also recognize sometimes investigations pretty incestuous... think we'll ever know sure. live NY, top ten question need answered. super common side effect. Moderate. hurts. headache. Seriously?

New long term vaccine. Shit inject ourselves. know happened past let shit like happen? inject far higher harm potential, makes easy us slightest oversight see it. 

How bad could be? Well, tell short, summarized story minimal absorption molecules ruin you. world leading scientist regarding work organic mercury compounds, 3 layers gloves on, extremely thick perfect environment. moving mercury compound pipette, spilled 2 drops onto gloves. immediately took following normal precautions. amount time would hands gloves miniscule harm.

6 months later died severe mercury poisoning. Severe understatement. know 2-3 months in.

This extreme example, comparison biological organism+our immune response? that? Injecting shit miniscule amounts kill you, very, different mechanisms action. 1:1. fast track vaccine Oxford one thing, new tech? Fuck no. Almost like a*global pandemic* shit. dont here.We read headlines cry world ending. takeaway crystal clear, sobering: one, even uppermost echelons power, immune virus.” Yes selfprotection always first. cannot help others end needing help yourself. get first stimulus, fuck second one too, im gonna furious. ""hold still, I've almost got it"" - fuck, lady, want circle you? Yeah, gonna need extraordinary proof extra ordinary claims.

This article smacks ""justifying opinions"". forget crack bones get marrow, thats good eating, let's get high mighty throw offal away. Organ meat lots good uses. 

Mmm, frankfurters made Frank's muscle, fat, intestines, artisan. Yeah it’s strange. large population rising cases, would imagine they’d least 10k. Reasons get hope First, cost. current machine, enters second trial phase, expensive widespread consumption experts say, relying cheaper models Second, availability. breathalyser unlikely ready end year, late second wave virus France.

But might useful places, e.g. difficulty sure breathalyser tests specifically Covid-19 every single respiratory disease.

I disagree that. Accidentally detecting *different* respiratory disease fine. That's error could much harm. Hydroxy suppresses immune system. person travel plaguestate like unless really death wish currently around 7k deaths per week. lift arms tetnas booster. 

Yeah. happened me. 100x better getting actual disease it?
 think we'll \*stopping\* all. Imagine anti-maskers getting vaccinated vaccination becomes available... yeah, likely. I’m graduating mine couple months, I’m excited. Lol, checked US numbers lately? know meme, truth far infectious think, limited pool people susceptible infected. Would explain lot places seeing much uptick initial big wave. Heath Leger's Joker: ""If, tomorrow, tell press that, like, thousand sick people die Covid-19, hundreds protestors arrested battling tear gas, nobody panics, ""part plan"". say one little old governor mandates wearing masks well everyone loses minds. Introduce little anarchy. Upset established order, everything becomes chaos. I'm agent chaos. Oh, know thing chaos? fair!""

We're Fucked 2020 disputing white people, overall, contribute world stands today? agree. liver not. says form immunity, resistance covid-19. might explain folks asymptomatic, others drop without warning. Americans know Victoria is, confusing un-American 🤣 That’s big scary number close 400 million people USA.

Over 50,000 people die every week US causes. 

COVID bad virus....we get let’s gain perspective folks. Also doctors, scientists, philosophers, people who've reached position without inheritance, etc. Shut up. 17% willing travel US less 5th, third, I'm guessing could 16% would travel US, CBC feel like saying that. Given family cultural aspects mentioned article.I doubt lockdown would help community much, Word LOT study back anything say? testing using differentiate droplets aerosol? delayed getting flu vaccine January year really really bad reaction - puking, fever everything one would normally bad flu lasted 3-4 days. remember super grumpy ""I essentially gave flu."" Anyways, I've back work since May assistant got COVID-19; 2/4 people worked close contact also got it, (thank god).  


)Not choice go back work either, forced to, office open 2 half weeks someone tested positive) im sorry misinterpreted comment. even think subreddit content rules. Repubs screwed regardless likely looming landslide every single month gets worse worse worse. real option pay people stay home pandemic played out. body bags keep piling higher higher get even insane. school open mid September. Mask mandates almost every state then.

When entire party's plan wear mask, go back work, school 3 platforms lead death gonna over. People finally learn stay home, wear, mask, eat rice that's takes. true. said, didn’t stop enjoying Dude Chilling Park Kits Beach last week couple beer (and small group socially distanced friends). Got everything crossed. ideas gets vaccine I. India? going surge areas, frontline workers people likely catch covid? I’m following comment, tests readily available masses US what’s shade NBA for?

More lockdowns quarantines. Read FAQ health would they? people alive today alive even were, toddlers. Unfortunately sone people don’t learn history, learn experiences. think anti-vaxxers exist? Purely opposing vaccines don’t know good it’s none people lost child diseases vaccines cure. come 3rd world country, vaccines embraced still see results polio, people remember measles mumps.

Nope, sorry that's incorrect. 7 day rolling average 8 9 deaths. positive infections daily. Aren’t ~99% people carrying “electronic tag” purse pocket already? First, required China sound alarm 2 weeks earlier did. Then, global lockdown 2 weeks, followed contact-tracing regional local lockdowns eradication. actually eradicable one time.

Today, what's ideal? Global mask mandates; indoor public gatherings, including church services, bars, mass transit, anywhere community spread; rapid contact-tracing, based diagnosis rather testing. think testing important public policy, high false positive false negative rates make testing pretty useless individuals. opinion though. Yes. open package wash hands after, fine. friend got much trouble drinking outside back 2019 (that looking underage lmao) it'd nice relief although know idiots gonna pushing far end well. Actually really interesting. would explain ridiculous offer got years back event (you know, socializing main event, tried make connections members industry).


The offer earned time still insisted would money end.


Seems like operated different assumptions. even mentioned bonus, usually get 500€ year, company performs certain level. offered bonus register something consider me. That's right set arguments! States bubbles. People travel states. need national plan. Maybe even stop travel states. mean traveling all. federal lockdown people continue travel like idiots.  Well government says safe effective sure inject old concoction care less what's it, especially gonna keep safe disease kills one every 1,000 people catch it!!!! allowing drinking parks (temporarily), except Vancouver, small selection parks even then, specific, sections parks.

This Vancouver thing tho - province thing. neighbouring cities, they've allowed unrestricted drinking parks since June... Hell like 2 days things vs alternative Covid19...yeah sign up. these...yeah definitely I'm concerned upcoming school year. I'm keeping teenagers home, go class since I'm college professor dumbass school open. Curling around face shields, lingering cloth masks. 

The fact is, experts always recognized, even 6ft insufficient, compliance drops quickly. kind shitty troll. Could say side aisle... many people died Chicago shootings *this* weekend?

Maybe ask country instead asking country you. Words said last decent Dem president. Models extrapolate future based current known conditions actions. conditions actions change, modeling error future date.

Where confusion? Globally 6000 deaths per day. make per week? 42000. priced garbage begin with, wonder stay afloat begin with, also pretty boring clothes. No. MUCH worse places born. It’s country. positive test result (since people rarely get tested prior symptoms unless absolutely know exposed). So, chances are, someone gets sick, sick unless normally spend much time together.  actually, shed backyard would probably nicer tent. m

She repeated didn’t wear couldn’t breathe. point said doctor’s note exempting (I told corporate). went telling could fined $5000 put jail saying that. 

She looked completely fine reading ad time.

Edit spelling Implying people heard single word doctor bold assumption given botched been. seen something like 0.64% overall, high 5% old. would think people would willing testing repeatedly wear masks?

Full lockdowns work, least lockdown well known spreading locations, e.g., keep beaches open close bars, keep parks open close gymns, allow parents keep kids home remote learning options thin classes parents work, on.

That's I've seen local news page comments, kids learning progressing, majority comments see complaining nobody watch kids them. clearly entire world fell US hoax... /s

A lot americans colouring map states grade school, thinking they're country planet. No, excess deaths likely start negative value (assuming zero COVID deaths) lockdowns reduce number car accidents etc. Waiting reward Ignoring helping feel irrelevant silly. feed outrage. life force.

Sadly still perform unnecessary circumcisions, even sadly, many given nothing something suck measly pain remedy amputation... Lol @ ""there vaccine"" comments.

Russia produces lots vaccines locally ranging regular stuff like Hep B tick-borne encephalitis one 2 WHO-registered Ebola vaccines whole world (see )

Russia inherited lots data Biopreparat , one world's advanced bioweapons programs. USSR later Russia also kept investigating viruses treatments part military research NBC troops.

The current Russian vaccine finished phase 2 trials (just today) phase 3 would start ... mass live testing usual. compare, several vaccines already phase 3 world.

There nothing unbelievable fact major bioweapons-research country make vaccine works, rush phase 3 live.

And no, can't stolen. started phase 1 2 months ago - alleged hack. Russia also licensed Oxford vaccine local production.

It would likely exactly vaccines Russia

- get Russian vaccine free, works, worse side effects

- pay Western vaccine works too, less side effects.

That actual situation say flu, hep B similar shots Russia. ""worse side effects"" mean sudden defenestration, like 20% worse outright ""super bad"". Western countries ""get"" mask-wearing. something weird Asian countries did.

There's many things governments wrong, seemed like cultural issue, I'm sure better leadership would changed particular fuck-up. Oh man, sure hope so. Obviously anecdotal, seen far men refusing wear masks public places women. many snobby stores run loss leaders many years branding sales done online larger department stores. COVID looting lack anyone Manhattan Instagram makes sense keep this. stores closing staying closed.

Information Ministry Health shows today 29/7, Vietnam 30 people infected Covid-19, health workers Da Nang. Also according information Ministry Health Vietnam, new breed ever Vietnam. Many questions raised ""What new strain Sars-Cov-2 virus Vietnam?"".
 

On July 26, Da Nang discovered new case Covid-19 99 days country case community. meeting Prime Minister July 27, Danang Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said Covid-19 cases Da Nang new strain virus F0 cases found.

The following article Assoc. Prof. Dr. Huynh Wynn Tran help everyone overview genetically modify Sars-Cov-2 virus, types, find answers new virus ""strain"" question. strain Vietnam?

What new strain virus?

To understand virus category, learn little viruses structure. Viruses non-living organisms, viruses contain genetic genes (RNA DNA) inside protein envelope. Viruses need host cell stick, clone, spread. virus move ""fly by"" itself. carriers Sars-Cov-2 virus spread everywhere close contact breathing.

A virus strain considered new change genetic (genetic) changes may change (or change) biological characteristics (ability attack host cells, ability cloning, toxicity, spread).

The virus causes Covid-19 Coronavirus family, called Sars-Cov-2, virus + RNA (Positive-sense RNA), large family viruses (size 30kb), containing string inside genetic gene (single strand) RNA consists 5 'and 3' (A) tail (3). inside cell, Sars-Cov-2 virus uses RNA sequence combine proteins host cell (replicase) produce new proteins (new virus envelope, new spike protein, etc.). ) continue cloning. unique RNA genome, Sars-Cov-2 virus structure unstable, easily changed billions copies replicates millions cells. Therefore, mutations RNA family viruses often expected occur.

A virus strain considered new significant change gene (genetics) change (or change) biological characteristics (ability attack host cell, ability replicate) , toxicity, ability spread) (4) (5).

Sars-Cov-2 replicated billions times since cause Covid-19, certainly many mutations virus's genes. Scientists around world analyzed found many changes single RNA gene sequence.

Types Sars-Cov-2 available: original 3 ""A, B, C"", ""7-8 strains G, L, S, V ..."", future 19A strains , 19B, 20A, 21C ...

Sars-Cov-2 replicating trillions times since cause Covid-19, certainly many mutations virus's genes. Scientists around world analyzed found many changes single RNA gene sequence.


Since beginning pandemic, Sars-Cov-2 virus gene closely monitored GISIAD, non-profit organization specializing genetic analysis seasonal influenza viruses Germany, Singapore, United States. .

In March 2020, GISAID identified three major variants (mutations) based 160 genetic analyzes global Sars-Cov-2 virus temporarily classified three groups A, B, C (pictured below). research paper published April details PNAS (American Academy Sciences) (6). Many newspapers hastily posted changes 3 new Sars-Cov-2 virus (7). true, small change variant, called A, B, C strains reasonable.


On hand, GISAID also changed naming scheme suit large number changes. Instead naming strains A, B, C, GISAID called S, L, V, G, GH, GR strains changing Amino Acid proteins translation RNA (8). However, type name many limitations time, changes. Therefore, GISAID intends start new naming method according year + letter names like 19A, 19B, 20A, 20C.

It natural new Sars-Cov-2 strains occur. current rate spread infection, see new strains detected.

Recently, Nextstrain, tracks changes new Sars-Cov-2 virus strains, begun name new strain (9) 19A, B.

Thus, natural new Sars-Cov-2 strains occur. current rate spread infection, see new strains detected. important question ""will change make virus dangerous?"".

Sars-Cov-2 virus changes genes slowly
To find whether Sars-Cov-2 virus dangerous, researchers tracked much mutation Sars-Cov-2 virus less. According studies Los Alamos National Research Institute, current Sars-Cov-2 virus changed low, much lower HIV seasonal flu viruses (11).

Importantly, evidence suggest virus added toxin, adding ability cause illness. article New England Journal Medicine showed Sars-Cov-2 virus D614G strain changed spike protein gene slowly, 0.3% compared original Wuhan (14).

D614G strain interesting strain
I mentioned strain Sar-Cov-2 virus, taking majority global Sars-Cov-2 virus, D614G strain. strain interesting strain changes amino acid (from Aspartate Glycine G 614) spike protein, important protein attach host cells cause infection. According Korber team also Los Alamos Research Institute, likelihood infection strain increased significantly due increased replication capacity virus (12). Amino Acid changes strains occur Spike proteins, making less dangerous.


Gene analysis biotechnology skills Vietnam also made significant progress. However, new virus appeared Da Nang July appeared GISAID probably new.

However, scientists UK argue assessment bit early little hasty (4), yet evidence virulent powerful Sars-Cov-2 virus strain (13). .

All Sars-Cov-2 strains Vietnam updated GISAID Nextrain

As early January, Vietnam genetic analyzes virus updated GISAID virus strains (and Nextstrain) (10). Data show 32 gene analyzes Sars-Cov-2, strains G, GR, GH, S, V January April 2020. shows skills gene analysis biotechnology. also significant developments Vietnam. However, new virus appeared Da Nang July appeared GISAID probably new.

Can new strain Sars-Cov-2 affect vaccine?

Thus, Sars-Cov-2 virus clearly changes, small slow (about 0.3% spike protein), dangerous may spike protein part (strain D614G). However, changes affect vaccine vaccine antibody usually able identify virus entire spike protein.

For example, changes current Sars-Cov-2 virus well changes Toyota Corolla model. Usually Toyota Corolla cars produce generation (generation) cars generation chassis, structure, seats ... little change interior, exterior lights every year , wind resistance, electronics..vv. general, even slight change, see right away Toyota Corolla. Sars-Cov-2 changed, see Sars-Cov-2 (and hopefully vaccine do).

The new strain Vietnam may D416G
The new strain virus Vietnam may D614G strain, currently raging Europe US.

Based analysis, guess new strain virus Vietnam might D614G, currently raging Europe US. According Ministry Health Vietnam, new strain likely spread faster, making inference D614G changes spike protein plausible.

Still, new strain may change virulence virus, way Sars-Cov-2 virus transmits Covid-19, ability patient hospitalized, die.

Therefore, everyone continue follow local authorities' health recommendations prevention Covid-19.

Hopefully Vietnam soon quell Covid-19 Stimulus corps order $25k/person. 1.5 trillion (that's 1,500 billions) disappeared stock market early could gone families. perspective, would cleared student debt US.

Hold politicians accountable. Petty shitheads $3k suits deciding 1200 good enough. holding money hostage unreasonable demands attached second paltry 1200, even enough one month's rent many.

They created shitty lose/lose situation pits citizens (parents) citizens (teachers). know answer ""what do"", important realize combating wrong answer. people blame, teachers refuse martyr themselves, parents can't make ends meet. Ha, good point. I've Toronto Montreal winter understand need hunker down.  still arguing arguing masks social distancing. even arguing real virus truly percentage people really die disease.

All design, strategy reality denial Russians use. long never accepted starting point end wasting time debating basic reality endlessly rather next. spent like year arguing ""Have Russians invaded Ukraine?"" debate never moves past that. this, never point go ""yes virus real, need masks social distancing"". end going circles around ""is virus real"" thing. Criticism status quo shouldnt always mean critic opposing sports camp.

This sports team mentality needs die. [Attitude reflect **Google Translate**

Why new cases COVID-19 prognosis severe risk death high?

(Friday, 07/31/2020 14:27)

Patients COVID-19 elderly group, chronic disease, obesity exhaustion, easy get worse, risk death.

Information Treatment Subcommittee said currently number patients COVID-19 severe development.

According Assoc.Prof. Dr. Luong Ngoc Khue - Director Administration Medical Examination Treatment, Deputy Head Treatment Sub-Committee, many patients COVID-19 period severe, aggravated, especially critical. fast.

As morning July 31st, among COVID-19 patients treated, following patients severe progression, severe prognosis, high risk death: BN416, BN418, BN431, BN436, BN437, BN438 ... 

In addition, patients progressed worse BN429, BN426, BN427, BN430, BN422, BN433 ... majority severe patients problem elderly, many underlying diseases.


Information press end morning July 31, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Truong Son, Deputy Minister Health said, infected COVID-19, group people high risk aggravation focus group people. elderly (over 60 years old), underlying medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney failure, dialysis, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary ...) atopic, obese, impaired masterpiece ...

""These factors easily lead risk aggravation infected COVID-19"" - Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Truong Son said.

Analyzing specifically mechanism aggravation, Deputy Minister Health Nguyen Truong Son said group mentioned COVID-19 reduce resistance, making virus grow body faster, Organ damage faster patients.

""I aware risk cytokine storm. people attacked virus activate body's immune system. system attacks virus also attacks internal organs, causing impairment."" organs reduced functions, leading severe disease, 91 patients Ho Chi Minh City previous period ""- Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Truong Son said.

During period, Subcommittee Treatment clearly record number patients experiencing ""cytokine storm"", however, according Deputy Minister Health, number patients showed signs, although changes signs organ failure well life threatening.

During period, COVID-19 patients chronic disease use respiratory support ECMO, mechanical ventilation, oxygen ...


""This dangerous sign, patients general patients chronic renal failure particular suffer disease, also accompanied serious diseases diabetes, heart failure, increased blood pressure ... virus attacks, organs vulnerable, resistance decreases much ""- Deputy Minister Nguyen Truong Son said.

An expert geriatrics said resistance elderly, suffering underlying diseases often lower age groups. If elderly ill, COVID-19 cause chronic diseases progress acute exacerbation, patients likely die.

In fact, countries large number people infected dying, proportion COVID-19 patients die mainly elderly people many chronic diseases.


  Source? thought scarring / inflammation typically healed fairly quickly (I really know) +Sunday places report. spend time focusing on

selling commercial time customers Yeah huge party people threw managed get every one infected within social circle. family big time campers/backpackers, spend week tent fun. healthy ones (or mildly sick one) sleep outside backyard week big deal. would still get WIFI, netflix, access grill. kids backyard camp lot summer. like live Phoenix Az. Usually people use MyChart think invited doctor. could also call doctors office ask check see vaccinated recently. access medical history file. 


As far getting shot, would get one next time doctor 10 years. Cause go real hassle probably worth unless get stabbed rusty knife haha. get stabbed rusty knife get one okay? also make nurses appointment literally take give shot band-aid good go. Super quick.

And sore arm really bad move arm enough. Mine felt stiff large majority people, symptoms. tbh that's mild symptom compared actual disease (look dare) county next us fair, also ""high risk"" county. sympathize, also stuck shithole. mean ""the half can't stop 'egging on' half's stupidity."" correct behavior, instead? got 2nd-grade math, you? shows. Good work.  We've totally fattened curve, like Dr. said...What? said, *flatten* curve? Oh no... cannot imagine. lucky parents 70s 80s. thoughts him. sad. Mid January me. 2 weeks fever, fatigue, coughing, etc. assumed normal cold exacerbated due us process moving drugged pushed it. Positano haha. rest country isn't. Honestly, don’t care makes long it’s China lol. Yeah would awesome US based company scientist founded vaccine, I’ll fine whoever return normal life. cooled isn’t fun lol. No. selfish. virus care reasons. sacrificed something. bed made writing wall January. come home go. Remember 9/11 memorial? Think we’ll get one Covid? 🤣🤣🤣 Yes, is. It’s dangerously misdirected anger. demanding everything need make in-person school safe, sanitizer basic income, government they’ve paid taxes entire working lives. Fuck public education. It’s outdated. Rubrics DUH - church goers this!!! /s mean meditation?  sure, alot stocks overvalued (Tesla, Amazon, Netflix, Nike Starbucks, since they're losing money now)..

It means stock got heated IMO. phase people want find next hot thing stocks overvalued, boring/staple stocks properly even under-valued (for example, utilities) simple difficult answer know. people recover quickly, die, zero issues, lingering issues. Maybe everything okay soon, maybe not. studies done right regarding long term issues, we've seen since whole thing started: science data take time. That's keep getting updated information even we're getting closer Fall. wait see, hope best Fully.. yes BLM POS racist hate group got crap load free money idiots trying trend.. done nothing get cops/people killed damn felon dying.. one worst movements even seen.. charged attempted murder. yeah known easy establish relationship count death.

there another complication, would subtract lives saved COVID19? e. g. reduction traffic accidents. maybe should. life matters lol. havent quite lived yet. clarify, life inherent valuem youre life valued done do.

So real number might almost 57% higher. TX ever report weekend? jep, reason comment got deleted. way say want stupid stuff like feel bad Lakota people. Sturgis usually brings enough assholes disturb land camp holy sites. 

Now bringing COVID kys since life doesn’t matter lol Truly effective lockdown requires sacrifice personal freedom, enforcement sees it, completely everything country ""stands"" for, mention two sides constantly going every fucking issue. pretty obvious he's it, told reason post would removed solely political. Think 5-year-old carrying home. understand they're older, they'll carry guilt long time.

""leader"" responsible every detail responding public health crisis -- resilient institutions bureaucracies able work. Americans seem think Angela Merkel White House, we'd fine, Angela Merkel forced deal dysfunctional public health institutions -- including CDC filled careerist hacks -- would gotten results comparable Trump. 

It's really alarming Americans seem think president -- ""leadership"" -- responsible every crisis. World Health Organization said Monday may never magical cure the coronavirus

I think many people expecting magical cure, apart actually believe horoscopes tarot readings. rest civilised world putting store science. Good move. Maybe he’s turning corner actually starting take seriously Seattle. didn’t see huge uptick cases afterward. go college PA, gotta say I’m nervous starting back up. There’s policies such, takes people start spreading like crazy. also anti-vaxxer, essential oil MLM-er

Edit: deleted rest, attacking poster decision found astounding contributed little discussion. I’m sure kind argument epic comeback works well real world. might make feel clever going make unreasonable people behave reasonably, it’s going make dig heals risk escalating situation. Firmly state position move away unreasonable people, need increase exposure nonsense virus getting argument. sucks people experiences like this, believe it. Also, probably helpful look things done research. I'm sorry act like toward patients. 

I'm physician treated way too. Even context asking 3 month supply meds type thing taking brand name vs generic - still blunder prescription. Like I'm busy work hours pharmacy so, favour? I'm lucky type treatment apart recent ones PCP - I'm looking **Kaiser Permanente.** announced illness Facebook June 25. previous weekend, June 20, took part counterprotest Black Lives Matter rally Huntington Beach. Claiming protesters deliberately spread virus, wrote, “If die, it’s murder.”

The blame game never ends people. onion make shit good. YES! EXACTLY! agree big part party serious problems needs taken care BIL lawyer. claims COVID-19 blown proportion reads (and paid dispute) articles papers doctors time. literally said doctors full shit. Okay Brad fun arguing virus! ✌️ Ok sure nice use facts. Here's truth you. border closed. ones wants americans thier country. country 6 trillion debt. thousands dead. people like still wont accept fact government fucked ass “It’s worth following president remorse leading followers early grave,” (daughter) added.

Edit: Also, assumed everyone knew higher death rate manifests younger victims. fyi, covid simply killing younger black people. 45 black gives similar chance 55 year old white person. Best advice, Whatever age, stay away young people, far likely asymptomatic carriers. Maybe take normal daily dose vitamin D? guarantee, it’s unlikely hurt. hell would china russia try conquer europe militarily? france UK nukes. china would conquer europe way conquered america, making corporations bend will.  Florida done shit job ways data actually one best.

It’s still realistic metric impact virus. find wondering day WTF still here... I’d welcome apocalypse. make swift start me. School starts county 20th. I'm keeping daughter home, glad E-learning option. I'm curious long school happen. Cases 1k already keep climbing. Opening schools awful idea. can’t afford Remember folks: ""Science stand way school reopenings.""

That's word mountain top gods us here, mere mortals drowning covid swamp. lol what, people dying BLM? waste life.. really hope get better. always need foster adoptive families teens. Group homes pretty awful places people want foster adopt kids younger 10. point, hard imagine people still consumed seething rage protests (while time promoting other, dangerous, forms opening) actually motivated public health concerns. show countries welcoming Chinese trade? Last read many countries enacting plans keep China out. Specifically India EU regards Huawei. 💫so far💫 Seems like parents didn’t wear masks. Tragic, avoidable deaths. productive helping family. I'm sure see trying really appreciate it! Someone posted website back things online quarantine, including schooling certificates. curious, send link! really oversimplifying extremely unfair way. Even ignore wild supernatural claims posted youtube account, opinion based anecdotal evidence stand scrutiny scientific studies show effective treatment. two arguments hold weight, irresponsible act do. Similar incident Walmart live. guy actually made racial slur didn’t end well him. 

It’s really frustrating see many people prolong pandemic following simple actions. Wear mask, distance good hygiene hand washing/sanitizer.

It’s hard. Canadian hayseeds aren’t fooling anyone, want golf it’s July don’t come crying us saying “I’m cold come in?” Hopefully none.  We're long past chances another shutdown. first one incredibly half-assed number economy...anyone opposed first one certainly fight tooth nail prevent second. 

It matter millions die now, ""reopen economy"" crowd two flawed (but incredibly popular) points work with. 

1. first shutdown work, second one would surely fail: false, barely shut first time (most establishments close state many others)

2. recession would worse second wave: know way knowing sure, I'd wager millions dead worse millions unemployed, oh well. Maybe jobs open people worked died? guess we'll see : \^) could turn deadly. Throw book her. know look state data get routed CDC right? shows drop. Keep living conspiracy land though. moving all, simply lying habitually need retract false claim, since smear. small handful times also constitute habitual use sources, anyone reasonable would read sentence prove done either instances. trader joes outdoors protests Berlin right mostly anti-mask partying much reason, kind social protests US tricky. Sweden indeed mandating mask usage science clear. Netherlands, except public transport social distancing impossible. love this: mayors largest cities Netherlands may mandate usage masks specific areas deem hard maintain strict 5ft. distance. mayors Amsterdam Rotterdam asked *visitors abroad difficulty understanding Dutch wearing masks.* That's right, wear masks appease foreigners might otherwise freak out. 

Taiwan great example country took covid19 outbreak serious, right first signals. vivid memory severely hit SARS 2003. outbreak made prepare exceptionally well. tight network measures place, including spare IC capacity, quarantine hotels, even quarantine cabs, yes, also huge stockpile masks. slammed brakes within hours first message new virus. first scan travellers fever, hospitalized them, first ban entry China. 

The thing is, things successful, difficult attribute success one thing, like wearing masks. Around world, lot (justified) fear, governments struggle curb fear well actual virus. many countries, tough measures taken, partly may effective, partly demonstrate public government control, everyone something fight virus. Ask Russia century progress minimal value placed life went. Soviets werent responsible WWI famines led revolution, Soviets choose launch largest invasion human history, Stalin behind wheel purges holodomir...
 
Either way population growth shitter. Around 135m. [the cougher] screaming at, swearing, insulting, threatening staff demanded return item didn’t her, photo item phone. 

What 😂😂😂😂 topic really understand use transmission rate. positivity rate barely moved testing numbers nearly doubled due huge back log. Rt.live us right around 1.0, really wish transparency around number using guide plans. Trump symptom people like voting people like GW. problem crazy people refuse wear masks anywhere. Cops go around arrest people, instead whatever now. zoo weekend saw couple Latino guys, 20-30, without one. Yesterday saw black guy, 60-ish, mask. Stupidity knows race. One day means little pandemic, indeed good day recovered new infections zero fatalities. gonna long war humans stupid virus, we're gonna keep wearing masks, keeping social distance washing hands. want days like one. know school Vermont this. planning take long winter break. years ago IIRC, think problem around league beyond Browns. happening too. Arizona Texas areas required refrigerated trucks. here. district refused implement hybrid plan lots parents decided Virtual School. guess happy number parents would send kids full time local school relented created hybrid program kids choose physical class part local class work home online. hybrid option shit show, that's sure. want kids learn digitally, opt full time Virtual School. professional system operation already churning educated students last minute oopsie afterthought like hybrid options.

But totally obvious point physical school attendance like following ball game ping pong many closures re-openings would be. 

How year's school supplies? sending home long lists stuff stock classroom cabinets like normal years? Stock cabinets school supplies school gets closed due Coronavirus week two. Then, what, hand supplies back kid take home them?

This deadly global pandemic exposing many flaws antiquated deliberately obtuse systems governance. Sorry end day last two right wing administrations US resulted thousands dead American civilians. However people want look that's reality track record. Right wing leadership proven flat threat safety Americans. there's literally thousands people dying like people time. specifically two matter much? shit. don’t option attend person parents still need work. get reference. Besides point, thought Pier 1 went business. lowest death rates world also impressive say least. think one hilarious/saddest things whole ordeal seeing countries supposed poorer, sicker overall ""inferior"" US, handling virus care respect deserves much less resources knowledge supposed ""1st world country"" user said!

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like living china, half links dont work :( June I'm mistaking. 

Religious Jews, churches, conservative politicians &amp; parents graduates, right wing gym beauty salon owners, started sue, defy executive order, overall fucking idiots.

...Governor give bit relaxed restrictions, thinking dealing rational humans, clearly work. 

Fuckers started 700 parties house parties, renting private house pools busing like 85 kids. 

We great numbers going down, arrest prosecute anyone everyone decides act like plague rat. YES, clearly better nothing. never disagreed that.

However, reason better nothing virus *mostly* airborn. failing understand tiny aerosols really are: thousands times smaller spacing weave cloth mask.

Technically mask stop *some* aerosols, negligibly small number.  main point 3 students died running masks on. That’s outrageous. weren’t allowed stop take masks couldn’t breath? Someone help accountable deaths.

They probably would safe virus died masks running. That’s wrong.


May 08, 2020 2-min education bureaus China rethinking COVID-19 control policies three students died running masks school, Beijing News reported eastern city Xiamen, southern province Hainan, central city Changsha issued notices either discourage schools requiring students wear masks gym class prohibit facial accessories exercise outright. ""She released $753 bond set formal court appearance Aug. 19.""

Also, poor child POS mother...take away monster. think eventually schools US forced make switch.

But intentionally set make it, necessary budget suddenly convert virtual schooling adequately.

It really seems intentional way defund education. Again. Hard believe used liberty nut, nowadays I’m almost fucking ready join illuminati. Sometimes, people can’t allowed want, impacts health others. includes pandemics global warming. point still angry protests racial authoritarian resents idea black people protesting police, actually concerned public health consequences protest. No. 
[Sweden Take Herd Immunity Approach Coronavirus silence win. Nah I’ve always mindset I’m lawyer see like court use expert witnesses testimony given high level credibility (which attacked course usually basis science experts lose credibility lose chance earn big fees). people wrote article (the parts read, read whole thing) seem like experts willing trust research based high level credibility. otherwise would make look like another uneducated science denier want. trusting guys credentials caused much rise cases protests counter protests sides political equation imho. want get thing safe well hope too. also think squirrels great common ground. Actually stock market good lower interest rates great money supply provided fed. Also buying junk bond etfs everything power keep things afloat. Things may crash inflation picks up. combined 180,000 deaths per year US instead 40,000 Nah 100 million doses Oxford. That’s one I’m hoping end pandemic year articles suggest there's virtually way pandemic least many years absurd part reason trust media declining years.

No one thinks day vaccine approved we'll go immediately back normal following day. 4-5 month period things gradually improve restrictions relaxed time road normal, going years like bozos suggesting. first vaccine first domino multiple vaccines treatments becoming available. Things begin improve January perhaps even December year assuming goes well. tax dollars follow children. amount based cost per pupil, much taxes pay. still owe tax, they'll reduce cost per pupil taxes. think that's great reasoning! SAS force use mask want board plane (and extra ones gate). nothing lose making sure people bringing certified masks. telling people country wear masks public, probably good point 65% protection *much* better protection, like US doing!

I doubt Swedes would get free masks government started recommending still get paid opt playing?  exact thoughts buddies UK, call people opinions ""uneducated pooftahs"" ""one six people actually voted Corbyn"". accurate? NYC, Manhattan... id wager Manhattan least double keep telling people don’t like it. Sure, Americans buying second homes typically means Americans selling family inheritance first home upgrade something better, money moving around people contributing housing market. economic activity means someone buys first home cheap puts work would potentially able sell home one Americans looking vacation home make money. true, anything close statistically significant way, every single reinfected individual family friends would complicity silent. agree it’s good cautious maintain certain level skepticism, makes logical sense mass amounts people reinfected heard few.

It 2020 get hear every time people follow Instagram much go coffee. idea thousands millions silent simply possible. *sad Lactobacillus noises* agree you. think parents fighting teachers vice versa. 30% state budget. third highest national expense education. Combined, spend fifth nation education per student top 5 close.

Education well funded compared nations. reference ranges tests erroneous.

We determine normal based cross section people reported problems tied x. becomes reference range normal abnormal.

Lupus really great example many patients eventually receive confirmation Lupus often spend years ""normal results"" receive good diagnosis.

Doctors looking reference ranges another piece data instead treat exclusionary process. ""Oh cannot thyroid problems thyroid within normal limits."" 

But normal might abnormal me. body temperature tends run cold. rarely get high fevers. I'm really ill, I'll read normal low grade. know normal, easy dismiss pieces data. There’s chance pandemic (worst part virus) could year/early next year people saying bars thing past man. person stunned statement context might make lick sense something delivered assembled large bring back might think take picture damage issue try get refund come get it.

But somehow doubt that's case here. like people feel way coughs people assault police Well wrong. claim made scale deception government Iran anyway comparable imperfect reporting coronavirus statistics.

Reports Iran show number deaths coronavirus nearly 3x government said was, people subreddit nerve say *buh buh whaddabout USA*, United States thing.

The ridiculous, conspiracy theories gets upvoted show much people subreddit despise America take granted freedoms compared people living actual dictatorship. Isn’t million deaths accurate? fatality rate isn’t accurate doesn’t include everyone sick didn’t go hospital. lack condemnation complaints tact support. human rights organization might put odd press statement report criticizing US, intensity behind criticism. muted response demonstrates support people United States. Ah famous, can’t argue Reddit like response, straw buddy. Enjoy Trump hate train. Ignore decades horrendous policy every scumbag politician office. people pathetic. mom nurse. long remember worked geriatric care. last job, admin work would help floor qualified would anything help patients. taking leave work, taking care 94 year old grandma. absolutely know Grandma right she'd still I'd spend every night worried her. 65, diabetic, autoimmune disease. 

My heart aches everyone health care right now. learning many cultures live together save money anything family friendly bonds usually make everyone wants together? isn’t merely shits giggles people “enjoy” that’s they’ve learned normal. anglosphere fairly foreign concept. USA seeing change towards leaving due necessity lot faster many places. health insurance issues also drastic *in comparison.* *change* makes noticeable usa even net number time slice isn’t highest. I...literally say that. speculating virus lethality even relevant virus long reproduces spreads death, hospitalisation recovery.

How showing incivility threatening someone? Bad bot. think shortage 45 minute tests? white house bought all. That's happens government stops counting starts hiding numbers. believe second. cult run pretty deep. reality ignored... yikes! might also pain know addition two basketball Americans, thousands died since made comment exact cause. clear, typically long-haul patients, newly diagnosed newly hospitalized ones. think Governor's statement stands, now. We'll see holds. Similar Governor Dumbsantis... opening schools kids age attend said schools! Got love  Selection cold cereals $23 
Bananas &amp; Berries

Holy fuck, there's upscale that's literally pouring cherrios milk point. banana costs $10 Exactly. Women easy target, really can’t let men get momentum really run it, many men hate women much it’s really crazy. Specifically one person. Someone used top KGB operative Cold war. happens charge. never going away want go back dancing house music, we're going dead within decade anyways Thank this. 

Until aware medical experts actually saying masks work all. Everything aware less-than-reputable media kept saying it. stand corrected. 

As far aware Dr. Fauci particular downplayed masks (,because low supply), never outright said **completely** useless, people keep insisting thread. look access deaths. death count actually far higher numbers diverted heart attacks, influenza pneumonia. false actually great. deaths factor, short term long term effects virus devastating, ones die lucky ones permanent disabilities afterwards top huge financial debt medical bills. Also fully perfectly normal expected range responses 😣 Yes think people underestimate fast Spanish flu killed people symptom onset.  Apparently KKK HQ Harrison, AR wanted bunch cheap motorcycles become available. Trump symptom, disease.

The disease lack education. fact many people, even here, claims lies shows severe lack scientific literacy. know many smart men follow though! NH. Thankfully, I'm outside orange curtain. referring Newson. amount found milk really enough Everyone knows protestors cannot spread virus idiot. specifically avoids spreading among large, packed together groups based ideology groups. That's funeral 10 people going cause virus outbreak kill thousands, tens thousands people throwing shit breaking shit screaming within extremely close proximity could never anything spread kind contagion. know. thought sub rule high quality sources.

They score well, keep allowing potentially thing CDC may likely question data states could false, whereas DHS won't. would still believe data coming say, California. gives states little leeway lie choose to. Same. hope so. don’t need see doctor person everything, price already went   see would choose reality tv star... voting Kayne November? it’s made political. know by. coughed hard Pier 1 died... “pandemic” setup Donald Trump win election. Bill Gates creating “vaccine” microchip us. Wake America, virus isn’t real. Yes commonly held view. think whether criticise them, think US covid hotspot still allows travel citizens world right now. US also recently recommended masks, reluctantly. seems harsh fault delay, facts whereas US delayed face overwhelming scientific evidence. Trump even said reallocate education monies directly parents send children school liking (for profit/ charter school) 

That's poor people go good school. African Americans protested Elizabeth Warren opposed wanted keep children bad schools. ?

We also people arrested coughed police. Assholes everywhere. 

I'm European think Americans assholes world. like say, ""is parent strain seasonal influenza epidemic since"". remotely true. Seasonal flu existed obviously H1N1 pandemic strain 1918. still get H1N1 strains occasionally now, 2008 swine flu pandemic. There's lots variants influenza reason vaccines better worse years researchers trying best target likely strain since attack slightly different ways.

Second, influenza SARS-Cov2 really infect body way. Suggesting comparisons like silly. Half sub got top positions Zero sympathy. fact much opposite. made legit sad. Anti vaxxers include lot women think protecting children, covid mask conspiracy theorists include lot men think government left China whoever get stomp personal freedom. Cloth masks better nothing even single layer 3 ply surgical mask would worlds better. That’s fair point. Wholeheartedly agree meanwhile ... 1. posted subreddit (in theory) supposed place COVID-related discussion, another r/politics. really idea personal politics. 
2. hand, think ""the left insignificant western countries"" revealing lot yours. ^(In case needs said, criticism. observation.) wait see high pump numbers August!!! Thank you, makes sense. criminals getting locked up, love unleashed take full blow unimaginable love. US healthcare/Oxford states cost share covid testing, antibody testing treatment $0. man brought himself, damn, saw give interview talking thinks wearing mask gave COVID breathed in, mean, could tell man spent entire life chasing dumb, counter-productive ideas, stubborn man, hope virus end him. hope could learn mistakes. daughter's statement powerful. instead sitting back letting cdc handle it, thought could use genocide democrats, realizing hit suburban areas hard Print story, show anyone refuses wear mask ask go explain wear mask.  Check study least conclusion, surprising.  

They found people avoided protests joined them, net impact increase social distancing. article linked published March 23. Even reliable news source, massively date Anecdotal evidence best. 

At point, reinfection serious concern would seen way cases due widespread prevalent virus is. despicable human might well Flare ups could look infected developing countries can't get treatment limit spread slums. It'll take long time ahead tallying excess deaths places sufficient death cert bureaucracy insufficient healthcare system really get good picture that. Yeah think half profit quarter came selling renewable energy credits (or whatever they're called car industry) car companies. actually making cars. seem worthy bubble stock price. There's way Students coming back person classes cold weather most, even that's generous. US anti- entire foreign countries before. goes around comes around.  Florida closed many test sites due tropical storm numbers aren’t particularly useful right now. drink milk working papers circulated discussion comment purposes. peer-reviewed  subject  review  NBER Board  Directors  accompanies official NBER publications.
 
...
 anonymous cell phone tracking data SafeGraph, Inc., well data local prevalence COVID-19 Centers Disease Control Prevention, demonstrate cities protests saw increase social distancing behavior overall population relative cit ies not. addition, **we find evidence net COVID-19 case growth differentially rose** following onset Black Lives Matter protests, even modest evidence small longer-run case growth decline. results make important contribution current discussion around policies controlling spread disease, also understanding human behavior general population periods civil unrest.
 
That's odd way word finding.
 
It seems they're arguing protests caused people stay home offset increase rate new cases. Except time (end May June 20 thereabouts) already seeing decline across board.
 
The continual attempt get people believe science stops working ""noble"" cause comes around self-defeating. think yes no. Assuming widely available vaccine end 2021, think spring 2022 going awesome time bar nightclub. also think going owned people owned 2020. Bars nightclubs typically poorly capitalized don’t see survive people willing go again. Sports probably make fewer teams competitive leagues talent won’t diluted. Either way it’s going painful get there. would still nowhere near 40 million dead. lethal Try finding public memorials lives lost 1918 pandemic... probably same. Honestly best thing could honor people die invest heavily education. holding breath either. constantly think kind risk associated private gatherings, kind enclosed space setting people going mask-less without social distancing extended periods time. sure everyone else's general movements own.

Unfettered. also, forget one purpose bring $$$ entertainment school play for. delude Yes, forced 5 months.  additional, related caveat... anyone chronic kidney disease also first check nephrologist supplementing vitamin D.  experts two months behind international studies stating exact thing? really half-assed. countries get benefit ""perhaps"" books? US?

Some dude posted excess death numbers comment chain 

US 50k excess deaths compared prior years removing official COVID deaths codename “lockdown &amp; die”  Imo gaslighting. questioning sanity. owners trying get something want do. Simple that. Broad usage term becoming popular even really apply. turned around started convincing players memory correct way yeah, see here.

To gaslighting convincing others reality live think via manipulation. Lying past aka ""We always war eastasia."" Habitual several meanings. posted link aggregator habit. Thereby habitually posting it. :D

ETA: seriously I'm bored diacussion. post -2 atm.

Your usual ""Below fold"" caveat applies?  also Coronavirus driving people away polls. Republicans get way forcing in-poll voting causing coronavirus spread control, they'll effectively limited voter turnout. all, one going want go polls coronavirus continuing rage control.

Earlier primary polls Georgia showed mandatory vote-from-home would lead record numbers people voting democrat. Republicans, order win, they've got prevent marginalized people (the poor basically) voting home. can't stop happening, they've got delay election order put place framework challenging votes low-income neighborhoods. Honestly, hope states follow.

I friend wants proceed 150 person indoor wedding fall. Would make lives much easier instead guilt trip we'd get going, state allow it. living reality right now; cancel own.

It's not, thankfully, currently allowed, venue helping look ""loopholes"" really don’t see problems drawbacks here

Families children either quit jobs pay (very expensive) daycares children suddenly home 7+ months. Nevermind Sdak probably hospitals prepared influx people know horrible thing say, wish could show pictures videos news people really sick, see need protect from. know HIPPAA laws prevent this, maybe people would willing sign waiver wake people real against. free tutor upper crust serious $$ pretty big ifs whole point. Sweden plan, implemented it, they’ve consistent messaging, even unified voice announce considering changing measures-like mask wearing, they’ve stuck it. 

The US initial reaction, back tracked based economy, public health safety, bunch different leaders saying different things, still aren’t page messaging, pretty much cohesive plan, even now, 6 months in.

For example, even today, Trump’s camp, Birx criticism him, Giroir contradiction Hyrdroxicloroquine, Fauci correcting everything says. guy we’re still fucking around problems testing reporting cases.

And again, I’m argue merits Swedish plan, lamenting US none. 

To suggest US Sweden way similar flat wrong. /s Nobody puts baby corner Touche going cling fact said “tend take 10 years”. know “tend” means right? hard number. That’s goal post moving. That’s desperately trying grasp straws proven wrong multiple times. 

But fine sometimes takes even longer. 20 years sometimes too. See links. 


Just clinging narrative despite economic reality. I’m disillusioned faith fact churches reopened church doesn’t take seriously.

Like, 

I get Christians believe God heal sickness, gave us medicine science- people like Fauci doesn’t too. 

The pure zealotry legit turning away church. It’s dangerous incredibly fucking stupid me. Venn diagrams circles, circles Venn diagrams.

We need Venn diagram explain Canada outlier developed economies. Japan, Great Britain, European Central bank, Australia Central Bank asset GDP ratios substantially higher US. grand scheme things, 20% outrageous, especially GDP states contracting right due ongoing pandemic. stimulus money going stop flowing degree masses people literally starving. ;) recently I've seen time traveller meme punchline ""Oh, first year quarantine!"" agree, way current tests work knowledge really get mostly accurate (\~80%) 3 days symptoms starting. think would beneficial could test population way, test currently would prove useful condition lead higher wasted tests test shortage backlog. said ""habitually"" 100% false untrue personal attack. find small handful links **two** months ago, that's someone said 'hey know far right sites, you?' like 'ah nope, noted' reference again. simply lying say ""habitually"" did. 

Thankfully BBC article mainstream Swedish press pick types stories more. choose eat foods increase risk heart disease, can't control stupid fucks refuse wear mask. 11,000 people died week heart disease, prevented mask, would exact quarantine mask requirements. argument makes sense, know that. care people dying, I'm sure champion heart disease awareness needed number downplay covid. disgusting. 9/11 = never forget

COVID-19 = *yawns* love NFL realistically probably saved cte minimize ~~disruption safety welfare students, teachers, families~~ number unwashed masses making money owners

FTFY Could someone link 11k per week prediction? looked closest came CDC page raw numbers shows much lower number (ignore last two rows, data No. I'm early enough career one year going hurt much (other work one year get older), lot friends family, really choice. say lol reading report hundreds kids getting really sick? laugh loud that, please tell me? 26% asympotmatic means 74% not. means hundreds kids going fevers muscle aches chills feel awful. Also [reproduction rate Covid19 meaning everyone gets Coronvirus pass 3 people average. well thousand people really sick die, what? fuckin sleepover camp everyone knew terrible, horrible idea? Everyone except governor? Three half days camp thousand people get sick die. sound lol all. widow woman whose husband passed, widower dead husband? Remember months ago 'research' saying something smokers bein less peone covid...I like give break thats bs, thats common sense way know truth sometimes children reduced cost Pre-K education boatload. strategy parents talking close 2 months. surprised made news now. actually hired one teachers school oldest went likely going make twice making school took PPP money fired employees.

I understand everyone it. wife also work full time jobs work pre-covid lines/hours work seriously blurred normal lives. tragic thing ones going suffer. Avoid superspreader dickholes unless want end like Herman Cain. advise stick stability unless can't live make right now. Stability going valuable factor employees foreseeable future imo.

really? killing people?  also thing Brazil

**So far.**  least bad 

*checks notes*

sub saharan african nations destroyed imperialism poverty! I'm dreaming quitting life running Nebraska yet think we're still good. bullshit. Case data available individual states outside CDC. get understand people choose live high rent, high wage cities complain live high rent, high wage cities. choosing live lifestyle environment choice people make. victims.   changed, maybe teach better school, secret American history taught differently state state

You right history taught differently different states, causes significant problems. major issues jump generally slavery, Civil War Reconstruction/Jim Crow periods. connected, taught differently *some* places for...less wholesome reasons. others, big ones. 

FWIW, think trend - education varying wildly states - going get worse left-leaning states start teach left-biased version history perceived need ""correct record"" whatever phrase would be. think necessary desirable - history partisan exercise, IMO massive consequences lying one's modern political benefit - think somewhat inevitable partisan dogfight everything recall deep dives slavery briefly touched going straight made tv version segregation. Japanese interment camps, horrors Vietnam war, trail tears, throwing democracies countries, Japanese endured atomic bomb, Tulsa race massacre. 

I personally learned things college, 'made TV' way. realize great public school system, know everyone gets experience. state one highest country terms education funding - states commitment, shows. 

\--------------------

One problem narrative history class preparation trivia game. teaching random event = evidence racism coverup; indicates calculus effective way introduce complex concepts build critical thinking limited time academic year. 

There *insane* amount content cover academic year, - college - teaching history covering broad historical timeline, introducing major/minor related concepts, digging significant themes connect eras, combining way means students build previous concepts understand new ones. 

Essentially...history important vehicle critical thinking skills. Digging individual events *can* useful...but think also one worst ways teach history. Again: history trivia. random dates events. understanding growth human society, critically evaluating major developments government/social progress/a host things, learning think, simply regurgitate. 

I also think basic level meant inspire people learn own. Learning broad themes/eras history class make people want go find time, consume history entertainment. everyone obviously, history fairly unique education subject also major source entertainment/interest outside school. 

\--------------------

My second problem (which mentioned above): think many people criticize history taught US good faith desire improve it, bad faith desire push narrative reinforces modern ideological/political leanings. right, broadly means fairly uncritical, rah rah, ""we're best"" portrayal American history. left, broadly means ultra-critical, ""America trash, redeeming qualities, we're worst ever"" portrayal. 

Both simplistic, tailored winning cheap political points modern era. Neither correct.

\--------------------

Anyway, original response push back general narrative see reddit US history education empty propaganda. think often issue either teachers lack specific content knowledge teach full history (particularly true middle school level, general teaching background content knowledge) students interested/don't pay attention. generally think issue information there. entirely possible situations, masks themselves, people wearing masks could spread virus faster, yes. 

Michael Osterholm shares view oversold effectiveness masks attempt convince people wear them, overselling unintended consequences convincing people safe things masks really is. may happening.

You confusing average density distribution. Picture this:

If everyone Texas crowded one single city, Texas would population density, different distribution. Covid-19 spread purposes, would expect spread look exactly big city. everyone spread equal size plot land would spread different. reliable indicator urbanization. measures percentage people living cities. despite population densities, Rhode Sweden similar proportion population live cities. One cause would consider beside virus itself, would one medications used. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

no, bikes trailered there, they'll put costumery sit bike street. No, they're not. US high literacy rate, probably higher count literacy person's first language.

They're reading seeing propaganda conspiracy theories. 5yr shelf life. China already buying selling currency large numbers. Couple points. We're 6 months agency can't tell us reputable yet? 100+ makers. one heard best about, powercon, supposedly fails water test. Also, sure blocking smells n95 p100 block smells unless vapor cartridge well. probably 1000 sites range fantasy football players season going happen, none KN95s. Frustrating men surveyed, stupid men infinity billion times likely fall conspiracy theories. stock market surges regardless going back classroom? Ebola also (more rarely) asymptomatic, tune couple per cent more. spread easily though.

The OG SARS also observed asymptomatic cases healthcare workers.

I'd expect 1918, 57 68 flus quite lot asymptomatic cases compared something virulent two. Thats masters degree mean shit since education quality declining He’s medical doctor. PhD. article link edit mention Dr. Tallinger all. Yeah, bunch people online may smearing him. Again, nothing common whistleblower come lots lots attacks character. called ""sluts nuts"" defense oldest tactic silencing playbook. actually quite often used whenever someone speaks uncomfortable truths. us anyway. know someone can't get vaccines chronic conditions has. gets really upset anti vaxers actively bring herd immunity protects people like her. Hopefully covid vaccine safe her. true school, remember giving friend lunches Friday go hungry weekend. 

This world shit. friend that's preschool teacher said feels like prison guard. kids square carpet toys books reading. wants congratulate well learning stuff give hugs high fives can't. Ah. wish people could sort shit like this. I'd worried suggest stay Phoenix ""not worried"" people. 

How dare visit known uncontrolled pandemic area possibly bring shit back Canada.

I believe healthcare right knowingly took chance pass cover hospital funeral charges.

This joke obvious America willing/able deal it. like running burning house. Reddits favorite word Lots kids smart enough know it’s dangerous though. KN95's head bands instead ear loops come across many them. also believe ear loops still authorized use within healthcare. BLM blame white police bet. probably testing anyone /s Going hefty enforcement social distancing bathrooms, concession lines etc... social aspect? 

Are worried getting sick? 

Do mind telling age? 

And know virus?

Feel free message me. Yeah, lot fewer tourists many locals spending summer city year. Traditionally touristy areas like Old Town Djurgården less crowded usual, “everyday areas” busier usual. feel like would worst test subject measuring side effects. anxiety makes feel like every side-effect. teens getting one hep vaccines felt dizzy afterwards, minutes sitting head knees feeling better started walking mom sudden couldn’t see anything led back lobby fainted came back still couldn’t see. nurse put bed passed back woke could see again. thought blinded like 15 minutes. lot anxiety around needles shots :( small handful times

Fair enough pointed bias do. Otherwise pure libel.

Why prove that? never made completely false personal attack.

I would like apology. provided links original comment. go Instagram people appreciate satire accounts, reason accounts go every Redditor’s head 🤣🤣 I'm lefty there's political party country me. corporate ball lickers. ""New Democrats"" started Bills first term reason Trump now. Self-hatred bigger issue.

I want agree need careful. KBO started letting fans back strict. mimic model entertain it. mistake surely. US values teachers pays top dollar /s Ron DeSantis heart right place best can. He’s bit slow that's one example, people know. fairly small subject sample. ridiculous label every single person want mask conservative. equally absurd label everyone following recommendations liberal. zero proof back claims. also, god forbid, teacher. see equal amounts Wisconsin even new mandate wearing masks here. Yes far see schools can. son OUTRAGED sit individual desks tables mates weren’t allowed sit carpet anymore. Democrats pass universal healthcare, say can't afford debt. Wow - 2 comments bottom article interesting disturbing. agree, pray enough, goes away, like gayness AIDS sounds like actually reasonable person. might time take close look party affiliation make change. nothing new Repubs, they've spreading misinformation destroying middle class least 20+ years. definitely saw pictures actual one day separated. seem indoors though, I’m worried that. Cases increased... wat also try fold.it like video games. Scientists basically broke proteins put engine makes puzzle game allows players try find effective proteins bind together. Players made breakthrough HIV enzyme stumped researchers years 3 weeks source several scientific papers.

 claim country value education write every fact disagree with? 

By valuing high test score averages teaching critical thinking skills. get 'educated' people can't bothered check sources. lol top tier doctors spent decade school whatever job experience. Compared dude waited tables opens tourist beers, still brings home half top paid doctors salary. Yeah man, figured think that’s humongous stretch. tens millions people going work capacity, trying careful can. Yes risk, there’s also risk many things. morally irresponsible us go work employers employee us general it’s essential Russian Roulette due chance fatal car accident? Evidence rock-solid, seems kids 9 less likely adults transmit virus even it. (This would predicted March!)

Elementary kids likely school. gain in-person instruction, least at-risk, keep groups instead changing classes every hour. summary says returned normal health 2-3 weeks testing. Granted ""after testing"" vague never says patients tested. Testing could mean tested symptoms occurred, already developed symptoms while. multistate telephone survey symptomatic adults positive outpatient test result SARS-CoV-2 infection, 35% returned usual state health interviewed 2–3 weeks testing. Among persons aged 18–34 years chronic medical conditions, one five returned usual state health.

They even specifically say long term illness real article even say ""public health messaging implications public health practice?**  result prolonged illness, even among young adults without underlying chronic medical conditions. Effective public health messaging targeting groups warranted.

[There's even chart near bottom showing percents people still symptoms, includes lot fatigue, shortness breath plenty resources giving message. [It's pretty easy (also references issues). symptoms, they're also easily found too, even CDC article, well resources. [GI Issues](http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2020/04/stomach-complaints-common-in-covid-19-patients.html), [long term heart / nervous system more.

There's difference spreading fear staying informed. wife best friend vulnerable am, one immunocompromised, wise stay informed data information evolves learn short long term effects this. Randomized! test often regularly. like trying surprise virus. test MORE! dumb Republicans say that, blowing $6 trillion deficit tax cuts rich people flailing around pandemic. Democrats get universal healthcare passed get control next ye ar. rand basis fighting pandemic  actually thought going give money portables, outdoor structures, teachers, no, nothing Article clear.  seems earlier executive order gave power Hogan issued new one explicitly giving blanket power close private schools.  still shut public schools.  shut individual private schools health reasons. 

Also image caption lists Hogan Democrat story says Republican. Source? Yes. stepsister pernicious anemia. fine vitamin B last time checked. flat earth, doesn't.  /ssssssssss Making me? make $350,000 taxes year. could work almost anywhere make amount service industry soo statement invalid hurts. 

It would smart business move! 4 establishments near always carry guess impacted though Covid? all. Hi, cases declining now? affect school reopening?   course hoax. wait till election, everyone going pop graves say ""Gotcha!"".

World's greatest prank! first time history, schools solve urgent issues social plans pensioners retirement benefits, money first place quite time! exactly reason worried trump elected. much could things really change. know many people crying. gifted artist wonderful person, I'd never say face. be. health systems often neglected nurses doctors treated awfully. One reason Poland locked well beginning knew fucked hospitals are. (Then people forgot mimicking US.) So.. I'm assuming prolifer too.. pre human matter human lived long time matter? death death.. cant pick choose. kind allllllll time.. pathetic honestly.  long data Phase 1/2 good, don’t actually see much problem Russia doing. Especially since way deaths “untested” vaccine would equal US facing via pandemic. players opt getting paid all? really says something players speaking you. Wow two ray sunshine. 🤦🏼 read article, thing happening Gwinnett County, announced 260 Teachers tested positive contact someone did. even enough staff. Dr. Birx May

Dr. Deborah Birx said 'there nothing CDC trust' White House coronavirus task force many fans People Sars 1 immunity 5 years later. part series memes thousand different memes time traveller mentioned years problems ahead? like, previous memes unrealistic(did zombies get yet?) finally one unrealistic positive side. personally liked switch doom&amp;gloom memes. aware u/TenYearsTenDays habitually posted links really surprised he/she would defend Dr Tallinger source.  Sturgis hospital clinic - Monument Health Sturgis Clinic. Accident victims taken Monument Health Rapid City Hospital. we? third country believes it’s overblown, yet number excess deaths official toll. Yeah that’s strange. hope stay safe healthy anecdotal evidence says men far wear anything Oh, I’m sure rate. think it’s called catastrophic insurance.  LOVE return drive-in –– one opened three minutes front door. tough kids summer –– five-year-old went go see Muppet Movie last weekend even start bedtime. Lots kids waaay tired end enjoy (if anyone seen while, way, still masterpiece). It'll interesting see drive-ins adapt screen daylight movies. What's happening August ? also likely die covid. it, dudes Erm, idk districts, go school does, schools going online first semester wont grow much, world ruled demented baboon funny left make blatantly racist statements trying dunk Republicans even realize There's limited research ties POTS autoimmune disease triggered, part, genetics.

I wonder helps explain family history allergies!?

You might also consider nutritional testing part tests. cannot recall think B vitamin (impaired MTHFR) also heavily linked flair ups EDS. saying surveillance. late contact tracing - virus running totally control.  I'm saying need let people know names (or location least) it.  

Somehow - someway - need get people take shit seriously.  think means making can't dismiss ignore it. cars come one hidden around spare days. sure doesn't?

If parked dirt prop axle place dig tire too. Obviously. That's Germany 8k covid deaths 5k excess deaths. Belgium excess deaths = covid deaths month ago. 

So still count. policy gets necessary see Germany counts deaths people get tested positive death better result. I'm thinking less soul find way twist numbers support ""on message"" narrative anymore. Never said that

By bringing thread done virus saying that. saying, saying nothing. original point. Sad story wish wake call people start choosing healthier lifestyle. Eat healthy foods, exercise, sleep drink water. Covid first pandemic, definitely won’t last lifetimes. 5 yesterday, surprising local news posts (wnep particular) full pro open everything trumpians. they're also saying would never vote gov wolf, shows intelligence. (He can't re-elected). doctor advising white house Dr. Kushner course that’s first priority, doesn’t binary thing.

Politics become way hostile lately, it’s like everybody forgot multiple winners single policy. woman tough nails. can't wait desensitized orphans :/ think better : ""Hunter said family careful know contracted virus."" 14/f/ca [This referring Imagine fucking entrenched arguing lower death projection.

Hey! right! Fauci wrong! Waaaay people died &amp;÷&amp;÷^# idiot predicted..... current administration done next nothing lead, quell death counts.... that, spreading piles misinformation.... DELIBERATELY, nothing political points ever-evaporating base.

Good luck, chief. I'ma keep listening experts. 600 kids, 260 tested positive, tested 344? knows many untested spread b4 tested. Oh, Gwinnett County Schools 260 Teachers test positive contact someone did, parents still protesting idea virtual learning demanding person 5 day week class full day. Please seek mental illness help One week hash whatever details better ""No muh leverage riders"" Why? hell would right now? black doctor right cause apparently opinions matter Indian numbers totally bogus.

They testing nearly enough. Honestly people meltdown deserve ass beat way could potentially work teams put bubble similar NHL.

I, one, would watch bubble ball. temper tantrum. point even educated people dumb. Trump’s economy. Ok you’ve lost conspiracy now. Sorry. Exactly. may, let appearance prosperity make forget contagious virus is. Even though country lot better US, covid-wise, I've spoken quite people say going restaurant social setting there's vaccine. That's certainly *my* plan. said, I'm happy see favourite local restaurants done well limiting takeout delivery. (Limited indoor dining permitted last week, lot restaurants choosing participate.) What's highest level education, kind curious plenty bikers races stop racism. makes cry. like i'm literally sitting crying frustration. anywhere since March 14th. miss friends, miss going eat, miss going movie premieres. probably able another year selfish pricks useless corrupt shit stain president. hate country Reminds middle school teacher said ""what pilot's time go?"" Ah first brush questioning religion eventual path atheism. Thank telling this. started vitamins weekend. scared wash hair hair loss. ""Non-facemask wearing passenger bus reports least discomfort"" agree this, actually ""go"" Highlands months, even lockdown went place. in-person online event, masks worn attendance limited like people read title automatically jump conclusions. true Sweden. March-July saw ~4,900 excess death ~5,700 registered Covid-19 deaths. doesn’t mean 800 Covid deaths actually causes, died of/with Covid, ~800 would statistically died time period causes. suggest Sweden pretty good catching Covid deaths, like Belgium. know ""per capita"" means? rest ""essential employees"" showing work whole time. Growing knowing lot bikers, terrible health, actually might even people going going spreading it, actively signing death warrent.

So instance, fuck em hope get shits sad AF u got fucked parents fucking lazy kid go back person functional vaccine minimum I'm different state position truancy officer cash outside lol Thanks advice, don’t trust judgement. Georgia teenager loses parents Democrat HOAX!

FTFY like Basque Country does, targeting high-level tourism gourmet nature experience. person local tourist office Bilbao openly stated relative mine simply don’t want low paying tourism south islands. think right thing rebound faster south. who?

Does matter? I’m illiterate literacy status person next bearing ability read?

It’s singling America out, American investment well population. know may aware health. 

I don’t know literacy status countries is. let’s say “most” health literate. everyone room struggling learn alphabet know letters still don’t know full alphabet, we’re literate.

Some 42% adults obese US rise.

20% children adolescents overweight obese rising 

A partial cause poverty (being overworked relying crap prepackaged food working multiple jobs)and lack nutrition education. 

But also consider 12% annual income excess $40k/year obese 45% people making $40k/year overweight.

That’s lot obesity. reason culture aggressively pushes consumption predatorily markets “health products” lack formal education nutrition, fitness health.

Another reason lack science health literacy people’s science literacy stops middle high school level *if even that* unless go hard science college. need teaching science literacy general rule, people going science degree.

At least, information vetting needs major major area study way 5th grade high school all, everyone goes college.

When high school Anatomy Physiology class optional.

Don’t think it’s little insane many people going around unaware meat machine drive around whole lives operates? People don’t go biological sciences college could spend whole lives awash unvetted Internet information crackpot theory fitness physiology gyms country #1 hospital 

Which fantastic good starting point 

but doesn’t translate health literacy all.

Just great doctors researchers doesn’t mean general public policy makers science literate. 

 means people willing monetize health people willing invest money recreational health resources, mean people health literate. 

On top average joe doesn’t necessarily know build proper fitness program combat 8-10 hours sedentary Labor day superabundant calories culture + huge sedentary entertainment industry. unfortunately average gym goer can’t afford personal trainer. 

Online information free lot people self educate effectively way also fall prey predatory misinformation perpetuated health product marketeering misguided movements like Fat Acceptance Movement. 

Our police force overwhelmingly shape. know guy works closely law enforcement contractual developer fitness testing programming called expert witness cases govt sue police agencies fat, shape cops sucking resources health care benefits getting hurt job fitness testing standards abysmal. 

If health literacy pertaining fitness nutrition lacking it’s wonder it’s lacking areas.

Its systemic issue lot first world countries America fact becoming issue places too. 

So there’s need get feelings hurt.

The solution get hypothetical pissing contest fat/science illiterate countries, invest better health education science literacy students, ones going hard sciences. ""blue"" states. 

that's.... works

There people colors everywhere. Sometime they're lucky live lot people them. Sometimes they're like me, floating along - occasionally drowning - sea another color.

I know single person IRL close online friend groups anywhere left center wearing, making donating masks since late March. Yes still bikers. Saw small swarm Saturday heading Sturgis presume, least heading west I-90. actually quiet today, work near gas station usually driven nuts constant roar baffleless bikes. government sowed doubt, me. pushing masks lying calling getting censored places pro-mask, went government recommendations. feel Reddit friend fellow Americans. We’ve lucky far, dodged bullet (fast forward November different story), well truly shafted directions eye, foreseeable future. Stay safe keep family safe x ignore it. try make public online learning good possible, can't prevent people voluntarily going beyond. Unless you’re wealthy, you’re moron. Sorry, I’m tired false equivalencies pretend you’re saying makes sense. Good luck there. Apparently one read albert camus's plague agree September part. There's still going spike tomorrow. south still seeing lot cases. We'll NY month even school reopening. worst past still lots suffering going on.  Serious question. dominant mechanism? I’ve heard fomites (which believe means bits virus left doorknobs, countertops, Wendy’s bags etc) big source transmission. also respiratory it? would happily expensed Monopoly game shelf, counted refund handed letting know never return.

It’s hard play football ventilator ya. Interesting resource, thanks! data looks mixed, that’s I’m wondering variables may play (apart onset treatment) Reality check time hurt feelings:

This blindly believe people solely based gender, skin color, etc. bullshit Good point. might account it. would say could combination though considering traumatic experience some. maybe might traumatized due experience mixed hype it, way hospitals handle (it sounds isolating), fact come still chronic issues moving pandemic lifestyle. It’s tough combination! also wonder disease impact brain chemistry considering psychiatric related responses active cases. know people avoiding getting little more. [citation needed]  know it'd nice thing could even find anything Pier 1 actually liked cost truck load. end ended getting cutting board, cocktail mixer, wine rack. Could got way less anywhere else, like super high quality justify original prices. Certainly scary number lets act like odds pointing toward entire NFL roster getting wiped this...

Your standards safety pretty low.

Imagine OSHA standards worked way think.

""Shit yeah that's amputation hazard—but going amputate entire *crews'* limbs!"" 100% would vote Crews-Rock 2020 Sounds like teledildonics would work there. Linked devices.  need Federal intervention Government actually something, apart setting guidelines saying ""Good luck!"" state.

I wish they'd done that. Federal Government actively made things worse, leave states, made political freedom issue. Best case scenario trying get political gain care died. Read worst light, actively trying kill low-income minority persons US. think often not, retailers/restaurants/hotels cave give want want. 

This reinforcing entitlement. companies would firm, might occasional asshole, people wouldn’t try game system get free meal/free room. one wears mask 100% protected. 

I wear N95 mask 100% protected I’ve quit reddit 3x quarantine far. self righteousness absurd lack empathy drives fucking wall... it’s closest thing social life I’m hungry conversation. Like feel stomach.

I live partner, don’t honestly talk much because... we’ve sitting next eachother things months, talk about? future isn’t fun even think right now, we’ve run past mention, so...Just chores honestly. definition insanity thing expecting different result Many places hire ""violent criminal history"" (assault absolutely counts) there's that. thought already established cruises bad idea pandemic. evangelicals read Bible. break quotable scriptures pull like MtG cards. likely telogen effluvium. speeds normal everyday hair loss see shower comb. comes back Aw means lot! Thanks! Trying think inconveniences necessary precautions keep myself, family, kids’ families safe, every little bit helps. nonsense That’s work. Unfortunately, federal government’s spending divorced taxation tune total tens trillions dollars counting (the National Debt). Also, ton money goes towards lining corporate special interests, including military expenditure.

Most highly developed nations much direct connection taxation improving lives ordinary citizens. It’s quite simple rosy USA, though.  Throw book her. Yeah think used wrong interjection haha know perfectly healthy people got ill Covid. prior past medical history 50 years old think many people think know healthcare professionals. frustrating. One reason take care metibolic health, everyone don’t join, find you. travel I-90 often. Usually week next week would see lots motorcycle traffic normal year. saw one trailer yesterday 2 today. interesting see picks much... Part hopes silver lining emerge this. Maybe maybe people woken bit liea bullshit, take apont educate learn think better. unhealthy thinking habits society, hopefully see new light end tunnel.

I personally think make antivax/antiscience/etc.. national security threat, put DHS money educating people better, smarter society handle viral pandemic, danger country whole people take serious. real broke right now? people deeply concerned Russia may make moves August based nature globe right now. real concern sure. live Alabama today big headline local paper deaths older married couple died hour apart Covid. 

Their daughter nurse hospital cared at, spoke reporter parents take wearing masks seriously.

The comments man, others living unreal. many like ""there's gotta story, daughter? nurse probably running around infecting people that's really got sick"" ""they must've bad health lot preexisting conditions"" "" really know die food poisoning hospital saying Covid money?"".

Shit make sense would rather cling silly if's rather believe facts.  learned America Florida world. Many communities black brown. People tell COVID isn’t racist. 

Sure, viruses can’t racist, healthcare systems often skewed people color. 

I think admin counted this. want job right now. Look president reacts, look public largely reacted, every bit news. family get death threats. Um, told HPD ignore county judge’s order April [the Houston Police Officers Union told everyone wouldn’t enforce ... ). spin local paper went April, Mayor Turner done ensure time different? outbreaks daycares. I'd say opining something clearly familiar says lot value opinions. Instead coming place knowledge they're coming contrary nature led equate ignorance expertise. Success determined nine months born. Oh, youth sports go. insane. Gary* eaten it.

Just kidding.

 man create virus, man destroy it. New Zealand country world anything COVID, know?

Yes. [CDC: 1 3 antibiotic prescriptions Fuck him.  refreshing (metaphorical) blood hands. certainly enough people's blood hand. long let door hit ass way hell motherfucker. Thanks! Pretty soon zero 70k day zero cases week, like magic. scary halloween costume year. Excusey McGravelvoice. professional sport wanting come back needs adopt bubble method. NBA deployed kinda works. aunt uncle teachers..... Fuck Stupid fucking idiot. link?

There's lot junk news articles claiming actual research not.

Reporters claimed someone lost symptoms got ""reinfected"". yet. Reporters financially incentivized put sensational stories make sure accurate.

Doctors sure beginning due lack data. let house cow pasture? live school district polled parents 60,000 students, 3,000 preferred signed remote learning. 5% people concerned children, themselves, grandparents, teachers faculty.

It's travesty. Jigggery pokery I'd wager dollars donuts gave parents. Probably chilling friends partying, got infected, brought home infected parents.

We seeing much this. wish Trump done nothing. He's actively done whatever make worse. honestly know anything could done more, spent past year promoting fake cures, shooting restrictions would helped, flat denying problem exists. Thanks. didn’t think New Hampshire evangelical tent shows. thought Midwest thing. Amazing. Mexico handling better US Grift perhaps mindshare believes works people saying works, proven wrong using scientific process takes much longer.

Claiming something works without evidence done quickly. Proving unsubstantiated claim wrong takes months. Millionaires easily doctors lawyers, whose work pays UI. able claim UI lose job? “Slow testing please!” 🤦‍♂️ parents keep going hydroxychloroquine. position I'm scientist studying Covid-19 treatment opinion whether random drug works, persist trying convince works. And, I've quite skeptical suspect underlying reason convinced drug works certain politician zero credibility keeps promoting it. 

Obviously consensus sub work, find plenty studies saying either work results inconclusive, comeback none studies used drug properly (apparently administered early two drugs). And, credit, trouble finding studies result work administered way. constantly looking stuff topic I'm even remotely qualified exhausting.

Can anyone knows clarify all? really like apparently strong opinion something know nothing about. can't believe real. Wtf. Could specific? agree shame happened it, I'm wondering we're page. 

I feel turning giant fucking outdoor mall play-place like-minded transplants/armies lawyers investment bankers come drive rents, drive cost condo, ruined NYC. cultural mecca, scratch head co-workers/friends moved still say that. I'm like... where? 9,000 Chipotles Starbucks ""culture""? art galleries trust fund kids afford get work ""culture""? beyond Disney-fied (seriously, Disney World puts classier shows, joke) Broadway musicals? 

Or REAL culture that's forced neighborhoods families called home multiple generations make way new hipster enclave? (Or sold out, which... fair enough, may well get rich gentrification). you’re going pretend protesters LA quarantine throwing molotovs police, least spell word correctly. Seriously, Florida? 


There PLENTY crazy people state city, water there? misleading title. believe article shared titled ""Coronavirus hype biggest political hoax history"".

As know, absolutely biggest political hoax history. anyone said virus hoax, person clearly gets L. state senator acknowledging politicians using shit political gain equate calling ""coronavirus hoax"". Flaired ""Good News"" lmao. Yeah. pragmatic.

What sound pragmatic educational inequality. Defunding schools often insurmountable obstacles success.

It's funny pragmatism always translates into, ""Our society irredeemable, cannot basic needs met.""

This seem pragmatic

Yes, might choose retire US absolutely honor pensions benefits. obstacles. decisions made. of...aliens. would go r/COVID19 they’re super knowledgeable helpful sort questions amount people ranting title bother read article amazing. posted number links reply previously provides data large number hospitals directly (not filtered state), remember thread basically said lying looking data?

Both SETRAC TMC provide solid data shows decline hospitalizations, see directly them. SETRAC region 1/3 state population, I'd say good measure.

Cases high either, also started decline.

And, previously mentioned, deaths lag well behind infection hospitalization, sure there's still confusion there.

If believe hospitals reporting accurate information, either spreading falsehoods least misleading/incomplete information. may isolated cases hospitals taking new patients, SETRAC region seen 40% reduction Covid patients occupying general beds last 2-3 weeks, room patients 2-3 weeks ago would sudden stop admitting them? region seen 25% reduction Covid patients occupying ICU beds, question stands before.

Now, want name specific hospitals cities seen reduction please feel free post links. Oregon (where live) sets schedule court date, statistics show 95% everyone actually shows up.

The 5% sherrif goes puts jail reals.

Covid fucked weird virus can't explain people understand sun comes morning. bad idiots ruin everyone. Sorry rant, sometimes frustrating people acknowledge stuff. April, president boasted Sweden lock people covid cases grew fast Spain Italy, long showed Norway managing spread right way strict quarantine (not sure strict tho). 

Now, August 3rd, locked since March 20th, +200k cases keep growing, thousands people lost jobs, 47-48% poverty rate, crime violence increasing, addition, president said believe economic plans! beloved Argentina continue sinking misery. think black. would say probably something genetics.

I think people anti mask protests probably racist anyway. Otherwise would BLM protest. darn well know voted too. Damn fools. Poor kid dumb cunt mom. snowbird trash Florida, go figure died, maybe. That's going require defendant knew/should known act high degree likelihood substantial harm would result (not could result).

To stretch. run numbers many people florida could versus total population, odds one particular woman likely lower would considered 'high degree likelihood'. 

Not defending woman -- criminal assault book. legal standard serious crimes going met absent assailant believing infected (or exposure suggested particularly at-risk infected). Attempted murder. Send away life. Got source? Brain swelling would make lot sense explain lot symptoms people ""recovering"". *Wall Street Futures rose news...* 💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸

Whether they're actually sick cough you, intention scare thinking they're making sick. 

I never thought I'd live see day someone's breath could considered 'deadly weapon', that's intent someone coughs someone else like this. Yeah it’s basically crabs bucket mentality.

It perfectly likely US could lose Empire still continue relatively successfully. Ask British person losing British Empire late 1940's early 1950's like. 

Loss global prestige influence, running Empire saves lot money. UK got free healthcare, socialist welfare state (including free college) fight wars every far place world. also got 20 year economic boom lasted stagflation 1970's. 

It's binary choice either Superpower Mad Max style chaos. speak European, plenty Empires rose fell.

I think 1st word (Owners) answers treat like this... think min. NJ natives basically New Yorkers, basically half Florida's population. Close enough. Nice, zero cited studies. Way go USA Today.

Nah. Testing hasn’t decreased meaning number new cases aren’t increasing  Luckily got fairly-conservative friends family around early Feb, politicized media shitstorm. cannot fathom frustrating must concerns loved ones fall deaf ears. They're blaming Obama PPE SNS governors, especially democratic ones. post-truth scenario... Yeah, wonder yet get teeth punched out. I’m pointing people don’t take care dying quickly right now. justifying ""do say, do""?

We also 157,000 dead nearly 5 million confirmed cases Jan/Feb, makes pretty shitty comparison. Nah cool, rich enough avoid consequences. love he’s like “No one’s ever told [to wear mask] before.” like he’s never encountered this. assault. stand ground. cannot even imagine many stories like there. can't fathom family must going through.

I'm sick seeing news talk cases gone certain areas. Testing also going many areas. hide info want, change facts. one taught different, rest learned TV Idiots That's called fostering. 
/laugh 
/cry actual fuck? people need realize now. strangers might get sick. family. virus care love family seen them. think somehow they're family get infected?? bring virus home, going kill strangers. going kill family. think it’s family, even people intend social distance, everyone still wants hug grandma hold new baby. People still end sharing food utensils carrying plates other. People relax around family. They’re *family.* stupid argument Trump trying make? Less tests = less cases. Look % positive, going down. Using logic ffs. sounds like you’re begging man. I’m sorry sound crass seems unsafe. Nuts. surprised one people coughing others gotten asses whooped yet. Or, US, shot. 

Florida ""stand ground"" laws, right ?

Coughing someone days threatening lives. Seems reasonable shoot fucktards. hall pass getting convicted, put jail weeks year trial can't post bond catastrophe many poor people never recover from.

You lose home paying rent. lose job showing weeks. lose kids cannot care jail waiting trial. can't go find witnesses give alibi crime accused.

Even eventually found guilty. life shambles since jobless homeless. It’s pretty inconceivable point roll back private schools. Religious, elite, athletics, home-school, whatever is, people accustomed able personalize kid’s education. one drawbacks antimaskers cite encouraging gen pop wear them: we’ll think don’t need stay *minimum* six feet / two meters apart we’re wearing mask.

I agree distancing vital protective measure take outside homes. 

But work best together: social distancing; avoiding groups people; wash hands thoroughly frequently; wear mask outside home. bringing tears eyes, poor guy. mom struggling right I'm best keep appearance her. basically running house making scared. know future holds us. feelings get thinking must feel dealing this...unbelievable. hope stays strong significant problem head injury NFL!

I would never want deal that, need car, never owned one life. 

If needed car get private spot $200/m. payment, parking insurance least like $500 month shitbox. definitely negatively impact economic viability releasing theatrically. Think number screens local multiplex versus drive-in. mention common former versus latter.

You mandate masks. close congregate settings, like bars gyms. meant won’t eradicate virus. Technically healthcare workers vulnerable populations need vaccine order us return normal. considering unmeasured harms? mean agree wanted mention complicated anyways argument wether gaslighting really obfuscates problem. Rich people (athletic directors, head coaches, conferences) making students take risks without giving say matter. students say choice play problem. Union representative negotiate schools that's travesty.

I read articles talking wether play quote everybody students. see costs playing talk wether risk students worth students even want to. like Shrek movie line: die that's risk I'm willing take.

That's huge important factor taking account. can't say Spain Italy lockdowns deaths per capita higher Sweden's, come conclusion lockdowns nothing. Look countries surrounding Sweden. Sweden done similar lockdown everyone else, would able stop widespread community spread like Norway, Denmark, Finland, ended probably 1,000-1,300 deaths. Instead, Sweden almost 6,000. Sweden lockdown allowed virus continue spread. obvious everywhere north east Italy/France/Benelux hit badly virus never got major hold there... excluding Sweden. There's reason that. Lockdowns countries helped prevent continued spread places virus already circulating weeks undetected (Spain, Italy, etc), places lockdowns helped prevent widespread transmission happening (Norway, Poland, Austria, etc). Best scenario half online half school That’s sad. Poor guy. enjoyed Simpsons reference I’m also glad many people working many ideas. Imagine alternative. fat One could say... acceleration key window. work way cool idea That's averages work, friend. Half people dumber *median* person. Bornholm reached Køge also. takes longer people usually wants go Ystad. grift. He's scammer. Whether knows communism irrelevant would great way things going seems Republicans power supporters want schools go back ""normal"" timeline safe so. 

But means, online schooling option entirety United States hell yeah agree you. keeps students,teachers,and faculty safe see problems all. deaths underreported US much 50% ( based excess deaths)? CDC starting publish information this. study recently found \~35% patients long term problems. term symptoms (several weeks several months still ongoing): neurological problems, insomnia, myalgic encephalomyelitis, tremors, GI issues, higher heart rate, viral arthritis, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, physical pains, phantom smells, tinnitus, cognitive difficulties. reports strokes, encephalitis, heart attacks.

I agree several million people needing long term care / disability complications dramatically affect people lives number ways. It'll difficult productive worker, work all, issues, it'll put extra weight medical system care givers (professional people around you), adds strain things around us.  think really depends are. suburbs? people care. Rural areas? one cares. live Atlanta (Buckhead) people wear masks here, actually seen someone wearing mask past times I've grocery store. wearing mask would stick way someone does. That’s investigative journalism. found twit Money. long time ago plague year terms, certain city China - places - actually pretty bad. much??

But really people going broke :( Dual Sport baby. Go adventure road wild. It’s beautiful lot closer dual sport. single hospital ever overrun, ever hear massive amounts deaths nursing homes. Still numbers skyrocketed right start. Blood type huge predictor bad illness (type O, common blood type typically mild symptoms type A, second common blood type higher chance ending ICU), well two specific genes (I’m blanking names moment). blood type genes determine easily virus latch onto cell. 

Add pre-existing conditions virus load time contraction, huge range bad infection be. single visit $150?!! one HSA plans pay obscene full cost every non-well visit? seems like effective deterrent people seeking treatment minor issues (talking totally aside Covid here...). Yes.

Mandatory masks. Groups larger two. One hour exercise maximum day, you’re going food one member household can. Curfew 8PM 5AM.

Nobody general care eb.dk. Also know America worst country world? never first lockdown. federal government failed many levels March. “The age misinformation” Hi random exhasperated American, also dumbasses often compare americans, we're sorry that. Please take personally. Regards, another dutchman

Edit: forgot main part, friend dumbass Exactly this. mature beyond years deal something imagine age. profound loss him. Yes, pointed ""stable financial system."" Would suggest stable unfortunate medical emergency put whole family debt rest lives one day next? lesson I’m learning without type leadership people behave way :( people countries much better sacrificing, American’s decades past. People made dramatic sacrifices WW2 common good

But zero leadership, zero effective public education strategy, spread misinformation highest levels, turn everything partisan game ... yeah gets pretty bad. Well good know USA decided take one team see would happen let coronavirus ran rampant. Good expirement see many thousands millions suffer drugs work ones send 6ft quicker. 

Thanks America, Good luck everything, definitely going need it. lost one parents (my 'main' parent) 21, close/good terms parent. Losing parent young shaped entire life way can't even describe people gone themselves. Though couple years since then, still find whispering multiple times week, crying begging could come back. still complete wreck probably rest life. time. Cities around world look like dystopia much excessive car movement.

Hoping turning point towards active modes (yay bikes!). Eli Lilly actually ever make anything without lying success rate? Damn I'm smart MLB even make 15 games without issue. ! longer US waits damage done. sucks shut everywhere else done brings back level normalcy completed correctly. country continues strict gatherings even though barely cases it’s effective. USA need act ASAP !  Interesting comment was


“Many previously healthy people get Covid suffer serious long lasting debilitating side effects.”

I didn’t say “young.”

Great people know seem recovered ok, case study “9 people know” little small use reference. Less cases concentrated smaller areas cases spread throughout nation. beginning e. g. NY rest country still fine. virus every state counties. Seriously percentages tumbling lol well maybe ton cake tied would say expected see 25% more.

The “gymnastics” involved people trying justify *single* outdoor activity different every outdoor activity. Early reports South American health officials (where NA seasonal flu comes from) state flu season much, much less extreme due covid precautions. parents hiring tutors aren’t directly taking money public schools.

I never said otherwise. mentioned Charter schools take public education funding another way defund public education. 

My primary point individual solutions systemic problems leads inequality. probably going 1-2 million Americans dead over. made reasonable choice, support fully. would hope teachers professors would follow example think debt covenants restrict things. 2 units available floor. downstairs neighbor moved out. happened June 30. None even listed. They’re offering 2 free months. second wave, probably move out. need start enticing existing tenants.  Yeah source

## Highlights

* •Limited early differences across groups observed titers neutralization
* •Five antibody features collectively could differentiate convalescents deceased
* •A shift balance spike versus nucleocapsid immunity separated groups
* •Spike-specific phagocytic complement fixing activity enriched convalescents

## Summary

As SARS-CoV-2 infections death counts continue rise, remains unclear individuals recover infection whereas others rapidly progress die. immunological mechanisms underlie different clinical trajectories remain poorly defined, pathogen-specific antibodies often point immunological mechanisms protection. Here, profiled SARS-CoV-2–specific humoral responses cohort 22 hospitalized individuals. Despite inter-individual heterogeneity, distinct antibody signatures resolved individuals different outcomes. differences SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG levels observed, spike–specific humoral responses enriched among convalescent individuals, whereas functional antibody responses nucleocapsid elevated deceased individuals. Furthermore, enriched immunodominant S-specific antibody profile convalescents confirmed larger validation cohort. results demonstrate early antigen-specific qualitative features SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, point differences disease trajectory, highlighting potential importance functional antigen-specific humoral immunity guide patient care vaccine development. It’s like complete multi systems failure USA decades making. COVID-19 US could less issue, negligence leader.

Time admit good job it. Pls god tell baiting m8 winking face directed imminent bankruptcy. Neither amusement, Hope things get better you! One many results inept country. paying lives leaders don’t care us. would arrange logistics send kids locations?

I think first job get locations open. really open could find 10 kids put they’re spread out, need teachers now. 

I necessarily thinking teachers on-site. would still remote education them. need someone on-site make sure kids fed, messing other, and, we're lucky, paying attention sending kids house worship faith don’t practice.

There open buildings. someone demonstrates works, people follow suit. Thank you. There’s evidence people reinfected interesting statistic, antibodies tell next nothing whether immune. Perhaps plan much people sick possible, mainly teachers, wait like 14 days resume school year good. might say “well, everyone’s antibodies now”. 

It’s horrible, might “ rationale” disastrous approach. even point? people can't optimistic US situation? looks like going better, might be. I'm saying is, I'm saying might be. States numbers cases affected switch HHS. people, cheer up. Florida testing less hurricane, thats 5k cases left per day, would still mean cases trending down. Also US good test count per million pop. still shitshow, cases underreported places. 

My point know situation bad, can't people accept relatively good news. cases trending know, cases trending real? Dude classes literally online would skip year Dear God really? hurricane I've seen texas plates last month ever before. thing giving parenting advice ""I saw kid store once, I've totally got this."" Pot... Redditors love again? source places? would workers want unprofitable business? Social distancing.. everyone it. Enhanced hygiene.. everyone's it.
There reason way back thousands deaths per day people things properly Friends got back vacation florida. WTH, people!!  Thanks reply. Hope things improve 🤙 good idiot test. Sad many fail. 

Portraying hydroxychloroquine forbidden cure allows pro-Trump media blame anyone Trump coronavirus disaster. telling, COVID-19 could cured months ago hydroxychloroquine, Democrats, media, Dr. Anthony Fauci would listened Trump! addressing December 31st. That's 150 days. stay 1400 dead per day, that's additional 210,000 top current 158,000. However, believe minute it'll stay low. Aside us still waiting big bump deaths 70k cases per day, we're going see absolute shitshow Florida gets hit repeatedly hurricanes federal emergency response organized federal pandemic response. Although, offer opportunity claim large number covid deaths simply due hurricane.

We've got 170 days possible Biden Presidency. That's half year. real leadership strictly enforced lockdowns, think could get control 2-3 months. That's control. eradicated. agree assessment. We're locked year. Ah show complete lack understanding virus.

Good luck news seems getting better last week. pretty much serious working home keep kids home online learning fall.

I worried confirmation bias, hard time squaring improvements actual changes I’ve seen. still worried lot fall.

But maybe I’m pessimistic convinced would get worse. 

Anyone else thoughts? Non-citizens allowed land USA. simple solution, fairly common practice around world.   Whew, article hard read. bad decisions US made last 50 years leading disaster pandemic. appalling. able look back medical history boosters needed every 10 years one 10 years definitely get booster :) choose bartender, make much money doctors engineers less half hassle. -7% decrease GDP sweden. That's bad, hear Finlands: -6%.

So, almost 15x deaths, slightly worse economical impact. Can't say envy Sweden. Yes!!

Mine jumps 170. FUCKING SHOWER. I've fainted 6 times course life it, nobody questioned it. first time fainted running laps kindergarten scolded dramatic. knew.
Each every time I've fainted either shower exercising. That's POTS 101. get 74 completely supine, 90 I'm sitting lucky.

Thank you! Though can't much me, good know (especially vascular) show everyone doubted right. Also, kinda want die early prevention ideal.


You advocate dare show interest researching know something's feel like shit get labeled insane. obsession finding what's wrong would insane actually symptoms, are. actually self diagnosed correctly child, even. Went doctor, confirmed parasite researched. Insane. happen everywhere. already happening canada well, know least one person thinking taking leave school district teach one pods. Obama’s legacy Donald trump. need side here. Masks good. Reusable masks good. masks good.

Yes, government officials made mistakes beginning. NOVEL coronavirus. even sure first spread. Given lack firm information serious impending shortage beginning, think pretty reasonable say ""recommended"". universally recommend it, said recommended yet. people went way far.

Anyway, REALLY need move it. Spreading meme ""the government"" (when INDIVIDUALS government) initially thought masks bad going throw shit soup convince people conspiracies valid. 


So stop shitting public discourse giving people doubt. message here. Masks good. masks good. Wear masks. easy. live Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley income. may paying less housing, I'm pretty confident still disposable income despite higher housing costs. Sure, move Chattanooga, I'd get new job pay probably half, even less half, now. headline ""According Radiolab..."" rubs wrong way too. Nothing ""According Radiolab"" (Unless it's, like ""What's Jad Abumrad's favorite color?"") Radiolab source scientific fact.

I enjoy heck show source entertainment, really wish approach extremely critical, life threatening, timely topic like something like ""how bluebirds find mates."" fun dancings around path science philosophy somewhere else. worst nightmare parent. April, May, June, July, August. get checked adequate titer measure it. think true, would ground breaking. One supermarket-chain wanted charge (1€) got huge shitstorm :D.

We also producing masks here. Let's safe. See September 2021. Woooow, human logic come WH? much accurate this? especially infection fatality rate age.
Because seems consider hoax. people 60 years. said - creates disparities. One figure article interesting specifically: median asking rent 1br compared PY. believe 4th 5th table.

I thought valuable know dropped large city. 2 weeks ago dinner outside across table someone tested positive COVID-19 two days later. never symptom all. two friends sat ate next person neither contracted either. us masks on.

I also attended Rodeo 2 weeks ago wore mask yet one around did. Cases increased, fact, decreasing.

I believe air movement huge factor contracting COVID.

We start allowing lower attendance MLB, MLS, NFL/NCAA football games well consider outdoor venues re-open. seen one German wear mask. think it; 20,000 Go way protest, yet many think wearing mask unnecessary. 

And people say Americans arrogant. say live people’s minds rent free, rest world isn’t important enough cameras pointed apparently? Sorry loss would love to. feel like Sinovacc would much scrutinized. I've lost empathy people like him. Keep mind lot US administration working vaccine. take whatever Germans accept. people 4th July barbecues watch fireworks outside.... perfectly natural want things normal. Almost everyone wishes back normal, even. feel guilty feeling way; using excuse stupid, totally fine.

Also, go virtual. There's info coming last weeks pretty much everyone spreads coronavirus, adults. Somehow people forgot rush deal everything closing schools interrupted usual ways kids teenagers pass germs around. (Assuming late teens SATs mentioned.) Purpose posting debunk claim

“Hospitals don’t get extra money Covid patients”

That false CARES Act pay extra. $5000 extra patient $33000 extra per ventilated patient You’re dumbshit think places going carry long term feel like you’re mad people make without hate life. 39,500 Big Macs sold McDonald's every year, order 20,000 once, can't handle it. gives?? Hotel exposes employees. That’s good.  sorry young man. May God bless future I've also exact thoughts. something happen someone loved, think could genuinely stay country feel good ever again, especially seeing places like Melbourne gone back lockdown 650 new cases, yet half America seems acting like regular old summer.

It's insane. hope mom stay safe! Microsoft solving functional software introducing bugs! we'll see Hello everyone! 
Some back story: work office three story building. department 13 people. 4 open floor setting (about 6 feet apart can't confirm.) rest offices doors. got notification late last week sent whole building someone tested positive basically thing worries alarm. Well departments talk manager since disappeared day (door always opened would office talk us.) Employers cannot give information one tested positive someone exposed direct contact supposed notify you, yes? working covid lucky. 
So I'm sure do? People come office take mask forget. 15 minutes though shared areas say sanitize/clean. cleaning crew, alternates whose duty work week imagine, doubt high levels clean. 
Now, gotten tested people have. waiting now. worried? high blood pressure control meds, mom recovering couple heart attacks stroke brother cancer (low immune system). meds controlling BP live mom brother enough sound alarm stay home. That's like everyone else, hope get pandemic dodging like fly window trying escape.

I thought maybe we'd quarantine said we're offices need. know need send email request know department work home til get test results...
I'm nervous send email boss stern set letting people work home. reason (her couple people random days/time wete met ""10"" people per county code) 

So advice next? Thank listening ramble help! solution. wish would watch dexterity challenged nurses take needle duty. Yeah, no. following science, use applies situation Sweden. 'culturally interpret' science.

What science saying must others do, others it. One needs look southern Europe see science clear might think. 500*

It’s looking 7-day average important. feel like everything going hurricane might inflate numbers little higher week, wonder people react does. last time went grocery store saw LEAST 15 people face totally uncovered. I'm talking parking lot. I'm talking line aisles. wonder cannot get control. sure sarcastic. I'm Reddit PhD, article least said virus typically mutate less dangerous, also become contagious dangerous rare ""Viruses mutate genetic errors time.

Great news. Nobody wanted deal carbon pollution planes anyway. Lost faith Birx cringed disinfectant injection never said anything Yeah, don’t know correct law/regulation is, I’ve heard ain’t it. something different incidents reported state Florida causes phenomenon couldn’t tell is. illegal immigrants pay insurance fund taxation, entitled care like everybody else. would expensive get sick end ER - insurance, hospital must eat cost raise prices everybody. They're already contribute. They're allowed use social programs, anyway. exception basic, critical service - healthcare - considered. 

And still like idea letting illegal immigrants use public insurance, least fix cost healthcare, able self-pay medical services outrageous. anecdote top head: British NHS available non-residents, still treat you, send bill. hospitalization follow-up treatment would cost 10 times less out-of-pocket America. Care give tldr might at? Oh, bad. Thanks correction. Karen still breed though. think things like time. point I'm depressed world seems like cold uncaring place.

Is something wrong me? Holy shit. got 🐔🐔🥦🌽🌽🥕 Oh thank much.

So correct estimate total infected, implies high IFR Italy, 2.5%. may partially explained older population overwhelmed hospitals Lombardy. Buttery mmmmMales Protestor: Covid.

Covid: Protestor. Goddammit lovely much unknown think misinterpreting comment. He's talking subset women women whole. highly think someone's behavior 100% random. People's behavior highly influenced environment: friends, family, hobbies, etc. Ain’t vaccines great? [something like job thing get tested, still work get positive result. Sounds... counterproductive like deja-vu again. want truth nonsense happening: feel flow Vaccination *will* super helpful, solve issues. ""new normal"" even close dictatorship, simply saying aspects society like healthcare, wearing masks, ect need become available widely accepted (non conspiracy BS) 

Plus economic fallout going hell next years :( BLM protests shown mask wearing outdoor environment spread covid, even without social distancing. know experts named protests meaningful source spreading covid all. 

So masks + outdoors + BLM sign board prevents covid spreading. Got that? 100% needs terrorism charge. Almost textbook definition word.

reddit: DOWNVOTE HELL

OP: adds tons riches emojis

reddit: UPVOTE GIVE GOLD 

me: can't even add emoji post due PTSD Great role model kid there. I'm surprised Cases USA going down. one worldmeters clearly shows top 4 weeks ago. think take months? entire classes exposed first day. entire families get kids isolating home. I'll surprised takes month places. times covid doubt many places asking people coupons anyway. Ironically would get vaccine meant allowed vote person instead trusting mail-in system that's easily compromised (like NJ recently, 19% fraud/rejected ballots). I'm surprised, unfortunately. Americans *not* understand many businesses break law fire employee, enough money lawyers keep plaintiff busy **years**. That's ultimately Trump signed law: big businesses (especially oil gas company) budget lawsuits.

The two things protect American people strikes class-action lawsuits. Even then, they're iffy. Without state health departments threatening shut people down, law-abiding citizens huge disadvantage.  Caughing somebody days equal pointing loaded gun somebody. OP referring deliberate cougher. Wait.... absurdity aside(I'm gonna humor utter disregard science time works), what/who suggest listen to? That’s got like zero comment. It’s even counter-example. So, italian kids don’t like living mum dad. Okay, deny possibility? There's always going someone shitty enough take advantage situation. whether let matters. dude used work returns retail amount times people tried shit unbelievable Guarantee won’t get one Biden either. memorial useful anything anyway. hang 1 friend house. He's also boss. work done car home office. wears mask out, gets things delivered whenever given chance. me. still get nervous. Also true, hours days general population reusing masks. source remember reading electrostatic charge lasts pretty short period time (I want say less hour). Someone correct way here. mask protect bigger droplets, charged ones work bit. 

But completly nonprofessional opinion, airborne spread major factor here, like others said, way hard control would way worse is. Like measles, would insane. corona bad, near level transmission measles was.  skimmed Facebook, accounts victim stand person. said mother ten inadvertent side eye, looks like spouse adopted/fostered many children, special needs. plus dealing brain cancer? woman incredible, cougher face harsh consequences. I'm talking Lupus something. mean _all_ autoimmune diseases. Even eczema IBS likely autoimmune. 23.5 million Americans sort autoimmune disease. That's 7.2% everyone US. that's diagnosed. 

I care test not. But, need group autoimmune diseases. Yeah likely improves innate immune response, would reduce severity america talking about, posterchild complete unchecked capitalism, literally everything monetized. also, complete lack kind social conscience. literally 'why care anyone me?' hey, 'MURICA cash bond. states got rid too. There's justification besides imprisoning poor needlessly giving rich free pass. ever hear articles bring ""stressors life"" talking people color? clearly white guy. black would found worst possible picture found something really awful say past. covid positive people? F guy Right hand. I'm left handed. 

And make 4 times today. astral sex demon busy. real reason 911 memorials that’s never forget first offense justify ensuing forever war. reason 1918 memorials don’t profit pandemic remembering afterwards thus pressure fix situation allowed first place. Meanwhile, there’s tons tons money made perpetuating forever war tax payer money. Never forget 911 forget quickly COVID-19 it’s inconvenient rich remember. expect sit home, drink beer, watch tv? going give $600 extra per week? TYRANTS!  Nah, public filmed... dont like it? Get sent jail yet people blame Walmart insisting customers wear masks. least income standard living didn’t improve, **maybe even deteriorated**

It *really* deteriorated (in real, nominal, terms). mean, except part top 5%, case there's very, *very* exceptions downvoting emojis might one haha taste what’s come schools open Fall. Waste time they’ll shut October. think normally pay something like 10% work bondsman. Let’s start go fund heather hunter like perspective. collective responsibility creation people. collectively fix it. capable building better world.

If figure right way embrace people, get let guard throw well. little girl too... read article, lost job custody kid recently. lawyer said ""This excuse, stressors life, people handle better others."" I'm making excuses either, guy edge likely fall days, know? think clearly *thinking* cost-benefit actions... headlines became common month charge blindly reopening schools. Yeah definitely. Could wrong haha Sounds like probably suffering mental illness, miserable experience staff cancer patient Lack education, made punching people illegal. Yup. add deficiency vit black kids disaster. don’t know answers question, tests look IgG full report it’s  need employer protection next stimulus bill can't believe 60% waiters covid. That's crazy. 20% school age children covid. That's gonna make reopening schools hard. even get started NFL. 85% players tested positive 9/11 = external/foreign enemy

COVID-19 = fellow Americans dense idiots time easy lack empathy victims like us (60+ yo) risky behavior

It’s possible turn narrative: COVID-19 external threat unity beat. need fear strategies, invoke strength unity. hard decisions make country needs protected. 
Put rules lifted automatically based time people trust power grab. 

Unfortunately top person US could uniting speech won’t it.  Happy fishing xD Yeah, that's true. Anyway, time get going. Long day ahead want go get omelette coffee favorite breakfast spot getting road. great morning. upvote... checking graphs yourself. lot news sources report downtrend day so, that's we've heard 100 different times last 4 months. hell needs special tray cheese Yeah, already decided won’t take job don’t feel comfortable. sucks position. know stupid makes feel admit obvious fact never occurred me. Damn. ugly, vile woman. People caughing people (on purpose) need remember lethal force might used stop attack. virus cause much harm deadly weapon, even can't see it. someone tried ripping mask caughing face saying virus...it end well them. think unreasonable all, hanging normally without mask, they'll likely give her, assume walks around house without mask. That’s it’s full people scared shadow. Like crazy cat lady anxiety problems Yeah... loooooool sure sounds like city absolutely idea talking about. **normally** access location  **nothing** app

So problem installing app no?

Google's API open source btw: like data sent google play services, use Blokada NetGuard something, say none anything app. Omg really dumb

Lol I’ve told repeatedly America country idiots like this. Perhaps it’s general human nature issue isolated one country They...they already sealed. surrounding countries. could get head ass use Google.  prisons get salary based many inmates take care of, private prisons power tell police go get inmates, prison system whole does. lock people regardless people want long system get changed, different system vouch people get locked stuff like this, reality we're living right now, would rather populate prisons people hurt anybody. Arrest records public states. “Some may die sacrifice I’m willing take” basically wasted time, money, importantly, lives. hey, let keep f-ing around.  aforementioned things burn vaccine here, right?? well. left house cause high risk job lot hate area. Yeah, bad. Either way crap shouldn’t tolerated freaking pandemic actually negative even page says positive 

which ones? vaccines  money brand new HD tourer, I’d buy bmw heartbeat. people speculating data journal back it. would think Docotrs noticing huge drop premature babies would doctors would notified still birth miscarriage. Comming current pregnant momma two consecutive miscarriage prior covid.... would want see data. Realistically think people large deal lockdown type restrictions 3, maybe 4 months max. What's plan long-term containment? strategy take human social behaviour account, can't make one blame people following it. policy fails enough people adhered it, bad policy. could absolutely developing symptoms symptoms, could early tell. self quarantined 14 days get tested half way through. Yeah, generally want charge someone something actually convict with. jury country would ever convict attempted murder this. over-charge fails, get punishment. vaccination standard many western countries. would wonder standard England many people died. Pretty sure run issues places punching someone face maliciously coughing need able prove it’s spoiled though. mean politicians pass laws? ""BATON ROUGE, La.

Secondly.... said exponential. number currently, grow, follow trend take heart disease. maybe start looking big picture. Probably outdoor protests using masks generally distancing (but always) there's actually specific evidence tying protests higher numbers damn, aint crazy media keeps reporting cases (which makes sense) rarely hear transmission rate... lot people consider this

edit: also, info transmission rate available? comment hateful. assuming anything. wrote it. standing ones principles instead scared shitless people think.

I convinced desire stick crowd bigger factor, beyond firmly held conviction mask wearing. say wearing masks, suddenly people are. One used stand wearing mask, suddenly one stands wearing mask, people start wearing them.

The experience inspired sense contemptuousness, many adults mentally moved past grade school, even health community stake.  Dem tiddies tho. I'd say March anyone paying attention knew COVID-19 plays proper measures taken. saw R0 estimates fatality rates, knew very, serious. kind agree you, want say however she’s probably buying food Pier 1 unless it’s plastic. Bail $753 bucks. Wtf Yes would get trouble unfortunately assaulting someone fact self defense Exactly. _so_ many people kind autoimmune disease would disastrous none us could get vaccinated. Better find road post market surveillance issue warning dumb people already vaccine critical tested safe vaccine actually safe lot people. feels like trump fools buying time vaccine. Cuz hey, that’s panacea.  need plan, strategy, etc. able accept news add merely dozens instead millions cases? I've seen page before. Note many studies either really small retrospective studies, really show much approval one case, actually negative even page says positive. Maybe got covid 10 years ago started losing hair. 

/s idiot think I'm serious. Donald?

Like ‘Pick soda shut fuck up, Donald’ Bad times. Unrelated, also 10 kids. carry anything, swear someone tries coughing me, I'm knocking out. problem full assaulting people. need scared. guys think unreasonable request sisters guests wear masks house? feel like asshole requesting make friends wear mask don’t want get sick live 60 year old mother... don’t want anyone house doesn’t live must wear masks right??? That's entirely true modern 3 ply masks electrostatically charged polypropylene catch even majority aersols. assholes do. happen lot forced re-opening schools evidence neglect kids. no, people take large sibling sets significant challenges money. saying never happens make assumption though typical reason people take foster kids wrong. arrested =/= charged

fuck judge give least month jail dyspnea shortness breath. gotta wait weeks say theyre “asymptomatic” opinion  Private schools make profit.... forget that? recent evidence points lowering viral load severity disease significantly lessened. 

Stop lying, study nCov2. Link it. also confusing viral load infectious/inoculate dose. Np problem. :) kind people need injected corona punishment one 10 kids one coughed *on*, cougher.

Also heard something pretty cool market negative three months election, opposing (dems) party likely win. it’s green party power likely win. like 23/25 times don’t quote thought cool statistic vitcim, mother 10.

Holy shit...  can’t stand subreddit. No, think like stating democracy feeble-minded, religious, uneducated population incompatible (and yes, adjectives also describe vast majority democrats would literally believe blue green Obama told so).

  Meanwhile, Centers Medicare Medicaid Services reports least 767 deaths among nursing home staff, making work “the dangerous job America,” Washington Post op-ed declared. National Nurses United, union 150,000 members nationwide, counted least 1,289 deaths among categories health care professionals, including 169 nurses..... numbers going recently though? Good luck man. county smart keeping us home while. countries didn’t lie citizens.

They said Netherlands, still holding position impact anything noticeable open air.

They're willing mandate indoor situations though. place wear mask public transportation, thats companies made policy themselves.

Sure wish peoples ideas freedom, fairness respect applied everyone, people social bubble. ReSeArCh Cases went range 200 plus day 5 thousand day course month so. People wearing masks botched quarantine implementations made worst. add insult injury, government insulting ridiculing countries tired, unequipped, highly underpaid health workers, health workers keeping thousands filipinos alive.

In recent news, countries president said countries health workers 'kung gusto nyo ng malaking sahod, magapply na kayo bilang police dahil malaki sahod nila' translates 'if want bigger salary, apply become police big pay'. Police done harm throughout entire pandemic rest health workers dropping one one. three truly alone together think may serious case paranoia still concerned many precautions. people numb find traumatizing, luxury witnessing it.

Correct. 9/11, buildings collapsing heaps rubble, obvious reasons hospital personnel recording patients dying horrifically. Please. bullshit. UK trying keep PPE stocks medical staff hence actively discouraged people buying masks. inconvenient, think. son showed us video he'd found woman talking hoax, using phrases like ""If media told pandemic, would even know anything happening?"" Well mean, believe lots things I've never personally seen, believe Egypt exists I've seen TV publications, know anyone died AIDS doubt that's there. think even like movie apocalypse corpses street would still people take care, ""I'm going let stop living life"" attitude. always get bitten something creepy warehouse eventually. huge part issue. unified national response instead “fuck you, you’re own”. used work delivery crowd, one guys anger problem, sometimes would scream phone people ""I know live"" did, written delivery docket front him. think ton us awaiting really good news virus.

The information regarding airborne spread virus known think. way admit interested politics growing Trump became president. remember confused popular vote losing Electoral College. Thank Lucifer's Dad, August. even Fall yet! sorry lost loved ones. still need work pay taxes order enjoy healthcare basically everywhere. Voice Reason! Low quality, high price. Yes. What's problem that?  They’re using big brain words now? know 45 didn’t say that. Scumbag. family member died . amazing human being....So balls say fake face? bet don't. F loser dumb cunt. really hope get it. can't draw complete blueprint technology yet, either due scalability cost.

However, reason everyone seems discussing ideas lately close even funny. happening speak.

Blueprints transition talking need start figured out. glad people trying things see works, saving grace stuck United States wise need changes, we'll already pretty good idea works not.  Gimme shoes E N G No, don’t believe that. would world wide keep people involved silent. That’s China, impossible west. understand disconnect, though. must’ve worse China, possibly ket quiet long. least rest world people could start distancing themselves. virus must’ve spread underground without anyone knowing contagious pneumonia was.

Let’s grateful it’s quite bad. We're going die. awesome. hope ready mass produce. ""Cases down!""

Everytime new technology especially big entertainment component, radio, TV, internet, social media comes people claim makes people stupider.

The secret is, stupid along tell good masks come? drop sky? sold many locations normally purchase them.

Tale old time. *sigh* Idiots like causing much pain right now. Wow idea thing happened. Guess history really repeat Pleasant surprise! understand. I'm angry us live like this. people understand options, lot do. dickheads spreading virus. unbelievably hard time hope family us get safely. Interior Minister 2020 Well they’re organization ethical treatment animals he’s fascist, equivalent lol.  Well guy runs numbers math back up... Meanwhile florida.. He's wholesome guy. really hope history remembers absolute hero is. surprise sure, welcome one. exactly death rate. 10%? I've heard many different numbers point. Jerry Cole, directs rally city, said organizers sure many people show up, they’re expecting least 250,000. Travel restrictions Canada countries cut sizeable portion potential visitors, said.

Others think rally could biggest yet.

“It’s biggest single event that’s going United States didn’t get canceled,” Woodruff said. “A lot people think it’s going bigger ever.”

When rally over, every year city weighs trash generated estimate many people showed up. year, also conduct mass coronavirus testing see people brought pandemic Sturgis. law may still require it, vaccine 75% effective Disney gonna single handedly kill thousands opening I’m jealous, wish trials could win early immunity. getting paid much it? Republicans told people covid way school shootings, unless happens kids own, try die. Apparently people s. Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Australia, New Zealand, Canada etc considered people definition Disney gonna single handedly kill thousands opening works American dying every 55 seconds. Yeaaa aren't, clever use testing numbers. There's way hell we'd back life like before. Maybe would better normal lives gone vaccine effective treatment that's widely available. Fill stands COVID dead. Maybe dear leader heard rushed Russian vaccine. 

DT gonna pull stunt. great opportunity fail. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ percent underlying medical issue. much covid ""just like flu"".

It like flu majority population tho. scientifically proven. one's experiences vary, course, that's viruses work. 48 hours netherlands strong suggestion stay home. 

9 days cant even.. first responders....I imagine tough jobs you’d think people would know better. Yeah Anthrax vaccine (and it’s stupid boosters) always caused sit ten minutes clinic collect tiny tiny chance one rare people significant side effects.

I think protesting masks thinking Bill Gates would waste time microchipping really paranoid dumb though. 'suggest' it. get ""call"" gives appointment time, also confirm ""you still want test done."" beginning know anything it. noone knew could spread people days symptoms. incredibly infectious stealthy. like flu! infectious flu sick! understand spike protein works realize mother nature one clever enough design it.  Yeah duplex tripled price since then, s/o's mom house flipping 2000 2015 quit due unstable market ever increasing costs. really effective U.S. took one quick tests took 9 days results come back. nine days could infected many people.

San Joaquin County 9 days?! stay home get result atleast? agree, even remotely reasonable response he'd least close polls right now, outright leading. Hell started take seriously month two ago began turn things around think many people would seen improvement supported him, even bad job overall. think far late far many people died. thinking y'all ought collect bodies day piff building evening news.

Seriously, listen science. peer-reviewed study shown correlation outdoor gatherings masks (protests, Disney, etc...) increase COVID cases.

If science says there's correlation, correlation. professional organization. sharing information medical experts around world.

 countries, people trust social media experts medical experts.In countries, government officials take advice stock analysts rather medical experts. 

 WHO's problem. make feel better, thanks. ""yeah thanks.. Let get pie"" That's happened all. Dr Fauci said ""people wearing masks, masks need saved health care professionals currently mask shortage"". went say access mask would ok wear it. also another time said recommending wear masks needed TIME.

u talking g614 mutation? Theyre studying great mutation far see  sections country little COVID kids still school. think fair say populated sections country online.

What happen schools economy open virus start killing parents teachers.

Not smart. bad optics Republicans election. True. normally run around. 96.9-97.7. So, people consider 99 low grade fever, I'm sick, feels pretty crappy me. Weezer reference? topic, recently went vacation Ohio. plane airport, parks went to, everyone saw (100.00%) followed guidelines wear mask, 99.9% 2 meter distancing protocol. interesting see. would made trip say Florida, something consider - flight successfully lands destination, state city, 100% mask participation (otherwise turn around kick offender). vast majority people follow rules given clear instructions leadership, appears. implications that? Guess thinking do. visible leadership case typically message box phone app followed instructions airline park employee maybe making $20/hour. made trip knowing rules place, else would gone.

I'm home now, self quarantining safe. didnt know brick walls could use reddit... 
NOT EVERYONE vaccinated. That's go herd immunity. numbers small enough covered it. need vaccines force necessary. Sometimes religion makes people insane things.

Their hearts right place, dangerous crazy. one talking people homeless

If politicians really want challenge themselves, figure way keep people fed inside home apartment type medical care fix mess.

Is much ask ? What? it’s doggy style, right? We’re still board fact lockdowns change batteries birds though right? nah way smarter Two months teachers alive today fighting every breath. preventable course, Republican leaders horrible people. Meanwhile wake low 95.7; human body pretty big range. Fascinating.  admire him? fat gross is? Anyone heard new mutation coronavirus? importing cheap labor 3rd world countries people call racist. get it, hate black people. One two events ends day indoor parties without masks creating super spreader environment. Guess one Ah, apologies. must mixed reading late last night.  Two concentric circles. Yeah, that's got internships graduation worked hard hone skills.

Yep one teacher infected school potential superspreader. cant schools reopen. sure. used one example one extreme cases. good chunk people able handle jobs remotely. put back list.  Except that, people outside united states like referred americans. way Americans like called canadian Mexican claim made *that evidence exists one REINFECTED immune Covid19*. claim, since desperately want never case ever could possibly reinfection, kept going day. Even pointed also evidence pointing immunity possible. 

I claim absolutes anything. ended post preprint get point across, whatever. evil person bomb. arms maker enrich. hold weight sadly, blows mind people find youtube video credible certified academic professional state around 1400 cases 57 deaths. There's definite anti mask contingent here, everything shut March. still gone back indoor dining bars closed. Masks mandatory since 1st month, businesses requiring since early April.

It helps small, mostly rural population rural states much higher caseloads. I'm worried we're getting point seen statistics, death. 

If 100 people die horrible, imagine 100 people big crowd dying. imagine 100 people know dying. Imagining tens thousands people as, well, people much harder. people can't think thousands people know. think big group: concert venue, stadium, something like that. 

But abstract. thought block numbers, people. say: 11,000 die week, realize 330 million people country? That's lie 0.003%, nothing. 

Because suddenly we're dealing numbers statistics, people. shitty learning environment created - “going back school” doesn’t make school. safe It’s still misinformation. gov health authorities could done lot could done lot sooner. article trying distract relieve criticism gov. Im 100% honest here. Trump either wins election, pushes back, Im Country. 

After that, far care, America made choice. morons Alabama West Virginia want live backwards nation costs small furtune get sick, go ahead. Texas Kentucky want live nation defined color skin, end new underground railroad. 

Im willing fight country built slavery, yet effectively heal evil. I’ve flu shot every year still got flu, went kids’ daycare. Got tamiflu. Still 105 degree fever two days. It’s scary prove $40k bank pay hospitalization get need ventilator. Ok. store management responsibility correct her.

That's lot predatory resellers buying supplies sell inflated prices. anti-government rioters well, forcing panicking old folks beg shout political slogans exchange masks. would government fault this?

It mask shortage remember, toilet paper necessities also hoarded panicking people week, incited lies fake news spread rioters.  LOL. simply said “may reinfected” wouldn’t discussion. Words matter. need pay attention construct statements.

Jesus fucking Christ. school district teach Texas put recommendations reopening extra curricular activities. course football important can’t football without band! Anyway, official recommendation band kids masks mouth holes practice instruments. Fuck I’m gonna doe school reopens. TWO WEEKS. middle surge.

Edit: [the link text mean can’t governor put restriction ? mean spread could lead hundreds deaths. Block church police officers etc personally doubt this. think internet social media giving stupid people platform show stupidity. like covid infection affirmed due wide spread testing. infection, stupidity, already there, aware actual number.  Bro video two weeks old.

While cases still rising nationwide, states seen large protests like New York Maryland seeing number cases states like Texas, Florida California seeing.

Minnesota saw 759 new cases yesterday (COVID testing slump aside).

Meanwhile Florida saw 7,000 new cases yesterday (also COVID testing slump aside)

Illinois saw protests June they've added 1.4k cases yesterday. top 10 new cases yesterday, still lagging behind Florida, Texas, California four Southern People wore masks back dude. hard look Thanks!  saw someone hospital collapsed veins like due dehydration. ended IV site top one foot. one failed, placed jugular! great point considered 👍 true!!! Looks like Raymond Holt true Joey Vatto Reds COVID 19? lol truth.

And they're surprised everyone invites friends house possible meet anywhere legally outdoors. Oh thought saying don’t gain immunity infection, yeah antibody tests suggest (what said). aware though, seems people might still generate T-Cell response without antibodies people think. I’m looking New York really closely mostly reopened, break rules lot seems (don’t get wrong disciplined group country comes covid still times packed bars etc) still don’t put many new cases day. I’m going make assumptions they’re anomaly it’s still something keep eye anyone familiar Worldmeter.com works, know listed Texas almost 5,000 cases today even Texas didn’t report them? checked source didn’t post number Worldmeter did. generally curious got number. Even that's true, they're good shape they'll still likely fine get lots exposure. Im especially conservative part Texas, personal anecdotal experience: wore BBQs wasnt perfect, people wear stores indoor public places (where masks disappeared previously).  Also, week seemed like people noticing rising totals probably altered behavior least somewhat. brainwash enough people get away anything, apparently. told mom ill sign first round cause I'm 28 okay dealing negative side effects cause time heal folks older get vaccine works top comment saying fingers crossed works gets public

Im good whole COULD THING also.  Colorado, including major cities, higher altitude 1000m. trust me, Denver dense. wait anticipation outcome. Well, long people meeting outdoors wearing masks, risk spreading covid. all, experts TV hardly singled BLM protests spreading covid, means outdoors plus mask without social distancing safe. know, that's asked person seems sure source think case Hahahahhahahhahahahaha epitome privilege. fishing trip cancelled. Fast food retail harder get jobs bit experience, pure volume applicants made competitive. think also good degree they'd probably expect leave job sooner wouldnt consider you.

I'd recommend user send message moderators (per link bot), usually reinstate posts. mom, retired nurse know better, said thing me. 

I assume Fox News.  Yeah tested took 10 days get back negative test result. another co-worker mine Exactly,its important find vaccine utmost importance safe effective nothing article, came google, implied kid hosted, attended, house party. still think fake news. get believe it. privilege think they'd take American refugees...
But recently moved deep south US/Canadian border, cold snow actually lot fun winter. poses like evil comic villain picture? eyes scream sleazy. 2019-2020 180 pneumonia influenza deaths Except long term impacts pretty unknown. still concern. Obesity studied correlational studies, longitudinal. 

As know ‘Correlation Mean Causation’

If look wording Obesity, always use ‘associated with’ ‘increased risk of”

The medical field never say, Obesity gives diabetes. would say Obesity increases risk developing diabetes. important distinction. 


More obesity:  That's brutal oversimplification, point distorts information, sharing interpretations incredibly harmful.

Death certificates list multiple causes death, because, they're written doctor, impossible determine exact cause caused person die. someone cancer Covid-19 gets hit bus, dies, would multiple causes death written certificate. that's know died: trauma bus, cancer got them, Covid-19? 

For reason, basic fact seems ""discovered"" bunch tin-foil hat people try misconstrue reality personal gain. That's downvoted that's others respect opinion. FL here, sister-in-law 5th grade teacher 3-month old twins. schools literally idea disaster go back person. county-wide mask mandate, yet heard parent went school office, none school employees wearing masks. parent chosen kid back person, quickly switched online. S-I-L's principal requiring everyone attend in-person staff meeting cafeteria ""masks required social distancing possible"" according e-mail, implying wearing masks cafeteria. Also, principal said teachers start online 50-60 kids 1 per grade essentially, whereas person teachers around 10, goes online adjust class rosters. none teachers want online, even really worried Covid want get stuck teaching 60 kids online, someone else teaching 10 online schools inevitably go online. told complain union policy basically extortion. unrelated news, average IQ planet increases 10 points. Yawns. Flu still kills covid per year. masks standard, people come get flu vaccine, vaccine applicable circulating virus, probably right. 

I'm going discount stupidity people though. went ‘flatten curve’ ‘1 infection many’ love cruise sure would cruise least years proven COVID vaccine developed tested. Feels like, ""hold bag meth."" Wow lot shitty ideas Gerald Ford tried Swine Flu 1960's. 

It go well. got loicence drink beer? go ahead schools. kind message CDC doing? still agency based science? Fauci proven liar. wouldn’t put stock behind says. Cough USA? like NE learned Spain Italy? recommend surgeons stop using masks surgery since they're useless. asked you?  discussion Trumpy co-worker insists crisis, worse flu, even crisis, handling fine nothing closed, masks needed. know type; live Oklahoma, type majority.

Anyway asked many dead takes make crisis. give number. 200k? 500k? line?

He doesn’t *have* number. Wouldn’t give one. Mumbles fake statistics moves on. huge chunk Americans absolute denial, think never control thing. grind deaths indefinitely. unfortunately, hear conundrum, think people heard Ebeneezer Scrooge talk reducing surplus population, think good idea (even satirical bit social commentary even time!) one making money sitting home working. don’t get you. Unemployment match someone’s original salary, less IMO. Still. year one travel in. Living Oslo go vacation outside house, I'll pick something without people around, travelling included. So, you’re suggesting race bottom would better approach? enough, still waaaayyyy many US plates driving around here. 2.5% testet corona airports NRW, Germany ""positive"". mandatory test 14 day quarantine visiting ""high risk"" countries like Israel, Turkey Egypt.  Something people realize lot times medical trials: due thoroughness scientific accuracy (and doubt legal concerns well) every single symptom reported participants *at point* study must recorded. Meaning one person went home stuffed face lunch choked death, death reported results. always wise take things grain salt, look breakdown (percentages) symptoms within given sample read study yourself. I'm educated child-care / child-raising can't really argue it. comment experience.

I went school 8am-1pm. parents went work 2pm -10pm. worktimes shifted week 1/3rd. basically, would see every 3rd week.

Once came home, already homemade food prepared. heat eat it. also expected clean me. 

I also knew homework, since parents *thought* me.

Personally, would call child abuse, since friends became high-educated working human beings contribute society. Maybe lucky? Though thought normal cannot think negative impact me. became somewhat self-sufficient responsible, guess.

Though like said, formal education child-care/raising. let get straight: something actively damages lungs makes prone get disease affects lungs (among things) severly someone lung damaging thing? Colour surprised! Reading comments new zealand life back normal. Ah crap, still need find buyer Bridge. think plays huge part. Ohio seem plateaued 21 day average, happening 3 weeks governor requiring masks ‘red zone’ counties, since last week entire state. living red county, we’ve seen numbers flatten fir sure. And, really pretty impressive levels mask compliance pretty sad start reopened May. may crazy, it’s *almost* wearing mask public *actually* works! But, yeah, think seeing nationals numbers start level due roll back mask ordinances, combined fact many people FL, TX, AZ etc taking Covid seriously begin with. think trend downward couple weeks, schools (k-12 college) might start cause issues. Poor kid, looses parents yet continued concern others. 

Heed advice, ""Wear mask"". ""If wear yourself, wear next person, could saving person's life."" I've using A, B, C, ,E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,M N,O P Q R ,T , X ,Y ,W ,Z bet it’s Church Highlands

Salk started nothing 1949 vaccinating million kids 1955 (6 years). COVID-19 vaccine 50 years medical advances plus groundwork done earlier SARs virus. Add fact multiple countries willing spend billions develop working vaccine? Yeah pull schedule lot. Id rather government address giant fucking mess going taking causes. barely help glue sniffers White House currently [Wealth indicator classic capitalist lie.

In fact, [luck wealth 

Lastly, remember [Einstein Officially, can't Québec. practice though, seldom bothered even legalization, long nuisance, fact smoke parks nobody cares. former history teacher, professional opinion don’t know you’re talking know, unfortunately live Birmingham AL. soon heard mega church, knew cult highlands going behind it. extremely strong grasp early adult demographics state, lot political sway that. also one original covid test sites state started testing, shut nearly immediately seeing huge volume people wanting tested interfered ability perform services weekdays. 

I used southern baptist mega church well, kinda know I'm looking comes weird people, Highlands exceptionally strange. continually talk like place be, spot feel safe, area meet people like them. like echo chamber full people education branch think something tithe. big selling point crowds/no wait. that. would money costs?

The 120 day federal moratorium expired end July extending help keep people homes city county. national state level policy Well, mean them, think. like forget person's name, might think existing years time. 6 deaths 2 people talked last 6 months.

Stop making fool yourself. lungs weak 2 layers quilter's cotton mouth nose enough ""literally"" smother you, need stay fuck home get groceries delivered, virus (or even cold, like many going around families stuck house together) *definitely* kill you.

Like, question. health poor, need quarantine. Weird flex yeah dumb shit that's coming someone voted several times. IFR people 50 much less 0.5%. think mean 0.005%. Nice generalization maybe less severed disease produces less spreading attenuates reproduction number

Since virus primarily spread via droplets, definitely. also shortens time ill average, also brings effective reproduction number since implicit time component. appropriate T-cell immunity response seen provide strong, neutralizing Notably, phenotype S-specific cTFH differentiated subjects potent neutralizing Trump’s first term referring food, after-effects consuming it? One negative will, initially, create false sense security people become even lax vaccine distributed executed mass level. surprise....not good one may add. thought nation 'Independence Day' like 'The Purge' I’m curious 45-supporters last month kept citing “Florida high infections low death rates!” say. Strangely silent! It’s likely case. Young deaths extremely rare US northeast. States like lowest obesity rates. doubt it’s coincidence. pick different statistic important one, happens low. say making great progress blank talk death. reporters ask deaths talk blank. 

The people voted idiots. Maybe shouldn’t solid opinions areas self admittedly strong suit? dont worry, ain't coming anywhere close woman worry someone claiming rape lol Hanity telling parrot tomorrow. agreed. what's even stranger unprepared US was. mean, DOD stated 2015 pandemic (natural biological weapon) #1 threat US. yet, literally nothing done protect it.

As Michigander disagree. feel done great job managing this. Specifically related concerns Executive Order **No. 2020-142.** 

Basically, Michigan starts see spikes slide phase 3, 2, 1. (From 4). enter phase 3 schools required go remote (for students -- districts requiring teachers teach rooms reason). Technically, districts Phase 4 remote well - districts opting for.

HOWEVER, republicans House recently passed bill contradicting this. ""Districts need order make schools safe kids,"" argued Rep. Pamela Hornberger, R-Chesterfield Township, chairwoman House Education Committee. Nevermind fact wife's school literally can't make schools safe. Like, physically, can't fit 30 kids 6 feet apart rooms hallways. I'm hoping Whitmer vetos bill that's comes to. might seeing class sizes 40-45 number teachers leaving profession. I'm sorry loss.

I'm even sorry every day see tweet's, blog posts, news articles filled people like ""Naaah, it'll fine"", love ones contract disease die.

America first world country damn it. One powerful wealthy world. This. Should. Not. Be. Happening. children adults lives teachers. Hey.. Wait.. follow discussion distribution vaccine. believe 300 million doses US/400 million doses EU. manufactured different places. US dated little earlier end year goes accordinly EU joins end year. 

I think approve safety mostly cleared. approach distribution country takes yet determined.

Edit: wonder efficacy high risk group fully determined. often old people respond well vaccinations. might case first vaccine health care workers, people high superspreader potential (many contacts throughout day) normal, young people increase immunity within country. BMI reliable 99% population. two you’re mentioning statistical outliers find funny one hand they’ll tell COVID disproportionately affects minorities take precautions slow spread, yet breath tell black lives matter go enormous protests, increasing infection rates rest us socially distancing like schmucks.

But guess I’m racist need shut right? smh believe total horseshit. Parents figure without government funded daycare since March. Essential workers dealing months white collar parents stayed home.

I also think schools could gotten creative offered day care option need. Use gyms, auditoriums, cafeterias yards maximum spacing 10-20 percent parents really needed full day option. crony got sweetheart contract never deliver on? be. real. outside already sanitize. Maybe wear masks inside (yeah know) best keep immune system strong. One weirdest things symptoms need present. live 4 people nobody caught home work work small store.

yep thats 21000 people. I'm pretty sure US tried fight fast food. problem easy. Americans dont long lunch breaks, getting fast food, making food start work really way get super filling lunch. We'll return almost normal vulnerable people essential workers vaccinated. great happens April. think lot different versions strict soft lockdowns across Europe. definitely large regions Spain Italy people go all. we’re still recommended wear medical grade masks. CDC recommending general public wear simple cloth face coverings. deplete supplies medical community all. Wait social distancing. masks ok go gyms wear mask got it. I'm shocked. Shocked! Well, shocked. miles miles bikes banners?

hope stopped flying confederate flag coworker terrified COVID keeps saying “as long underlying health conditions” “I hope numbers go down.” 

Like I’m Debbie downer gotta realistic. Birmingham hospitals still plenty capacity. Everyone needs care still getting it.

Stop exaggerating, OP. hitting second wave. 22 new cases July 3rd 431 new cases August 2nd. Almost twenty times much daily cases. scary development. Yeah, meant kook, sorry misunderstanding Mickey Mouse business... Interesting compared later trial subjects--you know sure got real deal. Obviously can't assume act though protected, feel better pretty good shot immune? saying what's sound like liquid injections cause bruising. false. know nationwide, feel sorry local restaurants close result. terrible precautions. care health community, bottom line. There's ways balance those, willing happy medium.

The Spanish flu came W-curve, people lived children also got infected often died often. 
Of course always outliers, young healthy people get seriously ill die.

Literally &amp; they’re gonna lie say throat hurting. Unethical it’s good cause. Yeah...this Louisiana. article posting daily deaths confirmed cases posted local news stations, immediate majority posts it’s fake. Look KATC WWLTV Facebook see comments post COVID. state’s attorney general fighting governor saying can’t close bars put mask mandate place.

Also, mayor New Orleans cancelled St Patrick’s day parades people went apeshit. Later swamped cases people blamed canceling Mardi Gras parades. cases soared she’s attack closing bars. can’t win.

Lol speaking saying hello. speak her. gave command really didnt authority do. still assaulted though Ah, approach defiant drunk drivers take licenses suspended. drive anyway! fun meaning it’s already 2 substitutes needed per school basing 2 week quarantine minimum. trying draw attention fact schools already use substitutes substitute shortage America substitutes 50. It’s good thing wouldnt trust opinion someone willing go theme park fucking pandemic. evolution debate largely root dealing pandemic- 40 years evangelical right teaching children mainstream science false.  (See also climate change debate) Trump gone bankrupt 4 maybe 5 times?  Let's real. futures stolen us long ago. 

We never chance. people wore masks time everywhere without fail wouldn‘t. bad people don‘t. act like it’s easy.  district analysis using available space rooms, could get k though 2 day, rest would hybrid.  

Perhaps read research try fit 20 kids room social distancing.  It’s easy means class sizes cut half fit.  school 2x space? sure hope tax purposes, though would useful people would probably still work income... probably different way... ""The United States health standards ""

He says let covid run rampant throughout country. church started 21 day fast today. watching home laptop. 33% show person, temp checks gave everyone washable masks weeks ago.

Is ""new normal"" present long longer new? vaccinated would need wear masks social distance? Sorry delay replying. check out. far tell, none. However, possible might missed something. anything sunny warm weather. Another tshirt idea outta here!👉👉 Sometimes feel simulations. 

Every pattern repeating. Like simulation coded someone know conversation Many die. that's sacrifice willing make.

Trump Reddit part-owned China, coming Reddit partly supporting CCP. government allowed tell someone can’t open business. livelihood line meanwhile every big corporate chain still open stupidity like going back 1918. anti-maskers ignored social distancing requirements too. several waves Spanish flu this. story excellent, everyone read Washington Post paywall. worth time, full text:

SCHOOL REOPENING ""I'm sorry fantasy.""VOICES PANDEMIC Arizona school administrator message America, Aug. 1 Washington Post Jeff Gregorich told Eli Saslow. (Full text - long)

This choice, I’m starting wish wasn’t. don’t feel qualified. I’ve superintendent 20 years, guess used making decisions, keep getting lost head. I’ll office looking blank computer screen, sudden realize whole hour’s gone by. I’m worried. I’m worried everything. possibility come bad one.

The governor told us open schools students August 17th, else miss five percent funding. run high-needs district middle-of-nowhere Arizona. We’re 90 percent Hispanic 90 percent free-and-reduced lunch. kids need every dollar get. covid spreading area hitting staff, feels like there’s gun head. already lost one teacher virus. risk opening back even it’s going cost us lives? run school remotely end depriving kids?

This classic one-horse town. Picture John Wayne riding cactus that. I’m superintendent, high school principal sometimes basketball referee recess. skeleton staff, pay average salary $40,000 year. I’ve got nothing cut. We’re buying new programs virtual learning trying get hotspots iPads kids. Five percent budget hundreds thousands dollars. Where’s going come from? might lose teaching positions basic curriculum unless somehow get running.

I’ve building every day, sanitizing doors measuring space classrooms. still haven’t received order Plexiglas barriers, we’re cutting shower curtains trying make that. It’s one obstacle next. last week found another staff member tested positive, went guidance OSHA CDC tried figure protocols.

I’m expert this, best contact tracing. called 10 people staff told they’d possible exposure. arranged separate cars got us testing site. staff members crying. They’ve seen happen, they’re coming questions can’t always answer. “Does whole family need get tested?” “How long quarantine?” “What virus hits like Mrs. Byrd?”

We got back two tests already — positive. We’re still waiting eight more. makes 11 percent staff that’s gotten covid, haven’t single student buildings since March. Part facility closed decontamination, don’t anyone left decontaminate unless want put hazmat suit go there.

We’ve seen impacts virus maintenance department, transportation, food service, faculty. It’s like district shutting case case. don’t understand anyone could expect us reopen building month way feels safe. It’s like they’re telling us: “Okay. Summer’s over. It’s long enough. Time get back normal.” since virus operated schedule?

I dream going back normal. I’d love open. kids hurting right now. don’t need politician tell that. 300 students district, they’re like family. wife teacher here, four kids go schools. know whose parents laid copper mine doesn’t enough eat. delivered breakfast lunches summer, gave meals day students.

I get phone calls families dealing poverty issues, depression, loneliness, boredom. kids wilderness right now, school best place them. agree that. every time start play looks like August 17th, get sick stomach. quarter students live grandparents. kids could easily catch virus, spread bring back home. It’s safe. There’s way safe.

If think anything else, I’m sorry, it’s fantasy. Kids get sick, worse. Family members die. Teachers die.

Mrs. Byrd everything right. followed protocols. there’s thing safe, controlled environment inside classroom pandemic, it. three teachers sharing room could teach virtual summer school. careful. back June, cases starting spike. kids home, teachers wanted together classroom could team new technology. thought good idea. It’s big room. could watch learn other.

Mrs. Byrd master teacher. She’d since 1982, always coming creative ideas. delivered care packages elementary students could sprout beans something hands-on home, teachers took turns front camera. three wore masks. checked temperatures. taught devices didn’t share anything, even pencil.

At first thought sinus infection. That’s doctor told her, kept getting worse. got call she’d rushed hospital. oxygen low, put ventilator pretty much right away. two teachers started feeling sick weekend, went get tested. bad next month. Mrs. Byrd’s husband got hospitalized. brother got passed away. Mrs. Byrd fought weeks couldn’t anymore.

I’ve gone head thousand times. precautions miss? could done? don’t answer. three responsible adults otherwise empty classroom, worked hard protect other. still couldn’t control it. That’s scares me.

We got whole staff together grief counseling. virtually, Zoom. There’s sadness, it’s also much fear. wife one teachers primary grade, asthma. explaining every kid sees automatically gives hug. arrive morning — hug. Leave recess — hug. Lunch — hug. Locker — hug. That’s day. Even everything perfectly, germs going spread inside school. share space. share air.

A bunch teachers told put retirement open month. They’re saying: “Please don’t make us go back. crazy. We’re putting whole community risk.”

They’re right. agree 100 percent. Teachers don’t feel safe. parents said survey they’re “very concerned” sending kids back school. getting bullied opening? district isn’t ready open. can’t people getting sick. threatening funding? keep waiting someone higher take decision hands come senses. I’m waiting real leadership, maybe it’s going happen.

It’s me. It’s biggest decision career, one part I’m certain it’s going hurt either way.

""The mask ordinance annulled effective November 21, 1918; however, cases flu began increase again, new ordinance mandating masks took effect January 17, 1919.""


So cases spiked requarantined mask ordinances Protesters outside wear masks. Sturgis rally people restaurants, bars, hotels, I'm guessing pro-mask crowd. That's difference. religious gatherings... want gather outside wear masks, go ahead. inside church, SINGING ffs. rocket science. Outdoors good. Indoors bad. Masks good. masks bad. Social distance much possible.  claiming death numbers fabricated.

That one misclassified motorcycle death proof 150k fake. Yes relationship low intelligence fundamentalist forms religion too. mega-church evangelical white, supply side Jesus churches fall category. Alabama Mississippi backwards make florida look like nice place live. unsurprising good emperical evidence this. Folks say 'people die anyway' still go hospitals sick.

Honestly, wish could turned away reply, 'Well, go die already.' gonna write something funny figured FB mom would mark ban mods arent super detailed.  plenty closed settings much 19% closed population infected, prisons, recent camp Georgia, ship outbreaks. 

As far badly hit places getting repeat outbreaks, immunity probably places role that, would bet could see virus make comeback almost anywhere people stopped wearing masks, working home, went huge concerts, etc. immunity population likely amplify effects control measures way immunity seasonal flu strains (but pandemic strains much) keeps spreading much less favorable conditions summer. Arizona legitimate decrease happening. Cases down, hospitalizations down. everything follows, deaths start go next couple weeks. I’d hazard guess it’s healthcare system detection.. much higher mortality rates is. Loll..their definition ethical treatment changes money. Totally corrupt organisation. That's one give sh!t thugs.. right Trump though. cops bad. black people bad. generalize. think New York excellent job containing virus. rest think they’ll never get virus Captain fucking obvious institutional piece shit. shit ???

There however, small delay settings ONS death figure puts number deaths per day around 25 day, last week:  I'd get covid vaccine every time flu strain mutates? really like rubella measles reason get vaccine. get risk people may want vaccine that's fine. rest us young healthy lot? sure makes sense long run.

Hell ample warning June

Russia, Mongolia, North Korea, VN, SG banned Chinese entry January (which pissed CCP, chose criticize USA) Get better mask. 15 cases gone April morphed half truth testing cases high. Privatized healthcare, ignorance incompetence half 4 million cases someone tell Trump? swear sub political agenda. kind agree things like, YouTube someone spout bunch false information without interruptions goes plenty websites. Yet people think YouTube Google research best outcome, lead results legitimate research done experts. That's best outcome. Crazy Kiwi's! 158 thousand dead guys telling people relax. idiot. teachers passed Covid tragic. teachers country undervalued appreciated. However, end 2019, 3.7 million public school teachers United States. don’t know many teachers lost Covid even number 10,000 that’s .0027% public school teachers US. That’s even including private schools around nation. 

Once I’m distance learning, say think that’s teachers likely going get sick die stupid. Hope it’s entering phase kills me. Fuck Fauci Birx ever heard polio?  think white people get benefit doubt? guy take responsibility anything. spokesperson, anything, head CDC. lack thereof also useful kicked back school total, uncontrollable random people start testing positive. WTH everybody thinking? parents really want try plan around kid school 10-50+% year, pre-set calendar? Get called take kid home randomly mid-day teachers? going better keeping kids home? necessarily social media - seems people genuinely can't think critically ""All happened before. happen again"" -Six. Battlestar Galactica they're sent white house ???? Whitehouse sends data CDC. CDC still gets Coronavirus data instead collecting processing data handed white house. get allergy shots month, confirm pain injection site exist non- COVID-19 shots. Idiots.

However, think 8 young. 10 maybe okay kids. biggest issue sheer amount time kids would left alone. fine leave 10 year old alone hour day school they're mature responsible, can't leave 10 year old along ten hours day expect school feed stay safe - that's neglect much time. Fake news. Don’t worry, August getting started. I’m sure worse last people wise Yeah, it’s fake alright. 150k dead something totally isn’t contagious disease. Dumbass. unnecessary traffic, without good cause, etc, closed (at least Danish side). also find strange, also think countries neighbours always good communication per say. 

As far know border really ""closed"" swedes working Denmark could still get work. People living Finland still crossing border work Sweden. Norway still hiring swedish medical staff work hospitals (and waiting coronatest starting also). lot policies sound coordinated sound countries. hope improve going forward region strongest survivor (economically, democratically even) Europe. Curious phrasing here: “if job found travel” ... Hmmm? 🤨 

Not asshole sociopath, you? 10x Ignorance bliss. Alot people mentality wont affect care Wait telling cops playing different set rules? Thank this! know allegory global warming.

Since seem understand process describes, think fair assumption read it.

The proposed system batch testing would improve efficiency areas positivity rates high; areas must continue individual small-batch testing. However, areas positivity rates fairly low, includes counties nation-wide, individual testing could massively reduced, freeing lab time samples individuals high-positivity areas. Based average household size U.S. (~2.5 people), number tests required stay informed virus spread low-positivity areas could reduced factor 38, freeing precious lab time individual testing hotspots. honestly slogan. Make America normal again. personal experience know tons people different backgrounds educations little hesitant take whatever vaccine comes right away.

**THERE REPORTS, AKA, EVIDENCE, PEOPLE MAY REINFECTED. CONCLUSIVE, LIKELY SITUATION, HOWEVER CLAIMING NEVER HUMAN EVER POTENTIALLY REINFECTED DISINGENUOUS, LIKE DISMISSING VACCINE RESEARCH SHOWING IMMUNITY POSSIBLE DISINGENUOUS!!!!!!!** 

For fucks sake, I've tried explain statement, obtuse possible, goddamn reason? wait half million bikers disperse South Dakota. Unofficially, deputy, generally in-charge PM away/sick.

Especially current regime, Amit Shah strong political figure. Controversial, strong. Touché Aaaaaarrrrgggghhhhhhh! really low iq right? question even morality towards animals morality potentially causing major virus outbreak health concern basically health standards animals kept close proximity. United States health standards. one doctor, one news channel, one person authority last 5 months told us naturally boost immune systems. 

We need boosting immune systems people wearing masks properly. Sole poor leadership states, never allowed happen, students belong classroom. bad news it’ll mostly Harleys. Shut down. MLB too. arrange things play bubble, OK -- seems working mostly NBA, providing ultimately entertainment worth risking people's lives, long term disability, spreading disease others. stop. rich enough already. afford wait next year. got football bro pandemic wrong. statement made July 1st, relayed father orthopedic surgeon rise infection state everyone panic stricken, good reason. Infection rates hospitalization. Worse, part knowledge condition, majority cases managed home. So, patients see hospital disease, lot home perhaps potential sources constantly pitched mantra masks, hand washing, social distancing avoiding groups. What’s evidence strategy teach lay public? First, experience Asian countries South Korea, Taiwan Vietnam high rates facemask use early pandemic. numbers excellent, economy hardly USA also enlightening. mid-May, news two hair stylists Great Clips location Springfield, Missouri positive, mildly symptomatic continued work wearing masks. 140 clients seven co-workers potentially exposed, 46 took tests came back negative. others quarantined duration coronavirus incubation period. quarantine, get tested got call twice day health officials asking whether symptoms related Covid-19. 14-day incubation period passed coronavirus cases linked salon beyond two stylists, county health officials current rise Covid positive patients states opening without enforcing guidelines. big proportion patients young people follow guidelines. also evidence infections occur people. factors contribute superspreading completely understood likely multiple including biological factors (features possibly related viral load), behavioral social factors (certain people high number contacts relative general population), high-risk facilities (e.g., closed spaces poor ventilation), called ""opportunistic"" situations (large events lots contacts, wedding), temporary increases transmissibility (as occurs loud talking singing). factors (masks, hand hygiene, social distancing, groups) important. Yet basic precautions taken seriously mitigate infection rates virus continue surge overburden hospitals.

edit: I'm posting name hospital anonymity links discuss transmission virus kids adults? I’ve seen lot reports known transmission way, including one discussed kids 100% virus adults. whatever saying wearing mask patriotic, fucking hell country infested morons. I'm really surprised first time I've seen Terri Schiavo brought debates like yet. lot things consider side effects. Vaccines necessarily 100% effective, could see substantial amount population getting vaccinated still vulnerable. could absolutely lead issue eroding public trust effectively dooming reliable vaccine program long time. lot public health officials voiced concerns it, Fauci said hoped would least 70% effective distributing it.

I'll bet money issue US rolls around. reason people really like say vaccine rollout going mess. already anti-vax movement huge spike conspiracy theories, government already fucked everything else. What's one mistake? town, nice radar side effect drinks go. far cops really seem mind shockingly people abusing little perk. 🕯️ rapid test higher false negative rate PCR test typically, I’m surprised. even legal? say though fact. also said last time. 

That means definitely underestimate American stupidity. Always Good scores masks hot distancing. Come 1918, get shit together. Normalcy different story, good job vaccinating people bring aspects old life feel like sheer fact went point 8 months pandemic it’s going kind hard get back normal routines

And ehhh yeah anti vax population lot smaller think anti vax people don’t fall high risk healthcare workers teachers almost like also gathering large events call want shut everything unAmerican well. said changing mind saying masks help.

Yeah, I'll wait year take fast-tracked vaccine matter ""experts"" say. I've lied basic science experts. Fast tracked still what, 6 months? that's someone get far far everyone getting it. church scam -- cultish pastor linked white supremacists. mean, terms harm society, limited. everyone else vaccinated, anti-vaxxers harming themselves, fine me. 

People freedom harm themselves. 

Not mention, they'd fight tooth nail prevent vaccinating anyway.

So whatever, let die really want to. 10 commandments actual content

People: Well wont stop dont know read Good hear someone who's serious they're being. Maybe hit dispensaries hand like kind Phish show little pieces paper nice pictures them?  know tidbit. Lol, ""dude juggling knives?!""

""OH worry, people die juggling axes knives. ok."" Way little testing going México. think died. breathe  unknown variable.. long term effects COVID. yes, I’d roll dice unknown vaccine versus unknown clearly aggressive virus. greatly underestimate important mere presence vaccine depression anxiety tormenting, disabling mental anguish presence disease caused. peace mind may biggest fastest effect it.  anyway actually knowing we've point? Antibodies drop 3 months neighbor said me. could think kids, family :( Someone interesting suggestion court order utilities cut water power places. make sure stay closed. places, like US, test positive symptoms.

That doesnt mean OP cant porch visit meet socially distanced backyard setting. Also [RadioLab Well thing overselling antibodies look like see herd immunity goal motivate people?
No country consistently, knowledge.

I hope masksb come fall nordiske lande. DK health ministry today recomended public transport. introducing slowly, nudge nudge. That's true, certain elected individuals government trying suggest idea vaccinated October. possible? know, maybe. extent CEO Moderna probably wants set expectations, beat possible, everything read says unlikely widely available vaccine end year. Unfortunately think lot people setting disappointment would rather believe elected officials, scientists, pharmaceutical execs, medical professionals. clever filtered cases/deaths white house instead directly CDC no-one ever know surges

it's almost like knew sat hands six months would best approach, ignorance I'm also Ontario. expecting Oxford vaccine widely available October? keep hearing different things.  Thanks advice! People might look like I'm crazy, think I'm going get one. worrying about, would use cloth mask. wife son's health important. constitution reason policy, reason LOCKDOWN state emergency can't announced similar countries. policy ""we can't lockdown"". policy ""we distance ourselves, keep clean, stay home feeling healthy, visit elder relatives, give chance healthcare cope infection levels go down"". see Corona way: looks like systematic failure. Why?

I live island absolute fatality rate 0.001%. Singapore reached even 50% this. such, call Corona harmless.

Still, nobody looking huge differences countries?

Are people countries simply robust Darwin job countries?

Why bottle neck created asking public wear masks leaving profession without supply? Grocery store workers since ones putting thousands people daily, many refuse wear masks even start fights workers. family friends work Walmart management yeah, would ok waiting longer meant got vaccine first. Good luck! Plenty people get fever told they're getting injected brand new, never tested humans vaccine. That's part reason run control arm: separate much effects placebo-based much due vaccine. Uh oh! conservative mention protests increased spread COVID?

Don't worry! remind anti-mask anti-lockdown protests happening less month ago!

(If keep arguing reminder made, means probably smart enough fully understand) get idiots actually take vaccine.

At least point, non-idiots hopefully able least protect said vaccine, anti-logic idiots mostly affect one another. I'm getting bad cold well. scary go week shop wear mask, SD, wash hands disinfect everything. could catch cold I'm everything catch Covid? 

Anyway, I'm glad better Covid. Stay safe. I’ve like 3 tetanus shots, arm useless week well. comments83820 back! Hurray! Yeah get sore arm two days.

Had actual flu once, never thanks. Stab away nurse That's basically bruise is. get fluid injected muscle regularly bruise. Imagine CCP cover-up data leaked, wonder many people actually infected killed CCP virus Mainland China We're saying super, crazy deadly children, we're saying kids spread immunocompromised grandparents relatives. 

Make Critical Thinking Great based hunger individual family survive would make sense. video producer make reference hygiene safety issues. reason except survival unacceptable abomination behavior. Either way, better ways. missed part article author says mask social distancing would need continue 'for years'

Regardless, interesting take. opinions life vaccines great. horse loose hospital know, Spanish Flu H1N1. still hanging about. people upset requirement wear pants public? whole science says masks work, 100%, work, yeah listen one idiot.

I hope Melbourne's lockdown, less strict, enough. Got extended family living work medical field. successful, could indicate need food delivery cut lockdown, also better safe sorry us. wear masks wait vaccine still live life normal. got party go sincerely interesting things like odd concerned still fortunate enough employed seemingly concern unemployed time record unemployment. makes sense time would focus aid unemployed. Why? I'm getting really confused. many people upset ""we lied to"" comes Dr. Fauci masks.
Am idiot, I'm ok lied real justifiable reason?
Like enough masks medical professionals, much likely interact virus, told people get masks, would buy medical grade ones instead clothes ones (for improved safety).
I know royally messed country, already adequate supply, wrong, justifiably best course action? getting things totally wrong? Imagine saying flu already exceed highest worldwide estimate many people die per year 291k-646k.. already exceeded higher end estimate we're even 2nd wave yet. mean, there’s something this. wouldn’t wild taking kids park bunch unemployed drunk dudes sitting around boozing flat surface.

Seriously, hope you’re troll you’re should’ve ashamed yourself. judge?  America isn’t able uniformly accomplish social distancing *months* let alone masks years.  potential long term effects though? Given vaccines generally take years make, covid ones fast tracked.

Should cause concern? masks helping, that's sure, seems park employees adamant people wearing properly, calling people publicly aren't, tossing park refuse. 

And yet, parks contain shit ton people, Magic Kingdom alone gets 100,000 people peak. ever seen busy, impossible social distance, though masks outdoor areas help. rides indoors masks required (water rides, roller coasters) risks get way high. 

Plus, protest people killed police using gestapo tactics thing frivolous mouse ride.  can't. That's part point Want hear something really nuts?!? paying $3k it. get covid, automatically another study get another $3k. money — work high risk industry (travel restaurants) need early vac. still nuts. Yup, get older stuff (novolin) Walmart. 

You correct novolin dangerous newer insulin (humalog), however newer insulins faster acting.

The danger difficulty using novolin arises requires much detailed planning scheduling. example, take couple hours mealtime (and plan portion sizes), vs newer insulin would take immediately prior eating (when portion already plate front you). 

In theory regulate blood sugar well novolin, practice, newer, faster-acting insulin much easier use leads better control. point masks absence context nothing picture says ""riot"" me. even two cops chilling middle crowd. maybe hurt cause got shot arm placebo.

Key word: Federal. locals authority so, could use reason. =/

Because White House currently filled idiots. Correct, talking October comment. They'll likely trials next year get threshold numbers trialed meet approval distribution public, millions, it'll tens thousands. I'm comfortable rushing that, want numbers bear safety efficacy. meaningful level vaccination next year.

ETA - feasible get enough trial vaccine administered follow ups confirm immune response side effects time frame, that's minimum 2-3 months. What??? dumb. zero need it.

Is solely make people can't drink it??? almost weird mirror anti-vax crowd. types like boil vaccine easy-to-chew list putting anything sold Karen's Krystalz akin boiling alive. Similar phenomenon, opposite direction. Easy-to-chew list vaccine going OMGMIRACLE cure Corona can't possibly go wrong vaccines beat smallpox upon time.

Even best case, going get something that's reasonably safe deploy public en masse. that's even considering fact vaccine is, intents purposes, fasttracked normal medicine development, testing, approval processes. I'd bet dollars donuts even (if) successful vaccine created, going take time really see whole list side effects occur. even longer get truly stable version level stuff pump kids regular.

So yeah, sometimes people threaten move Canada, actually go that. lmao. hope so, part thinks waves bubbles across US get vaccine Makes think China may bad all. mean, China actually wrong US also form fashion? Lol, Karen know Karen means ^^^ forgot cow urine. 30% ""unsure would take it"" kids infect teachers, parents, grandparents...and parents take work get others work sick, obvious disaster waiting happen. can’t stand many people listen fox news whatever dangerous misinformation spreading. Dick. anything else weaken immune system? Stand rain something? No, it’s new - feel cyclical, I’ve seen comparisons current response COVID-19 Nancy Ronnie’s response AIDS crisis. pattern proves out, I’m worried us really looking forward came after, particularly since Pottery Barn rule wound applying became inconvenient. That's good know. Seems like ridiculously high number me. long slows little that's good news. actually worry horrible spike end exact reason.

 vaccine *treatment*. may lower/eliminate chances getting this, *once vaccinated*, (probably) help recover catch it. existence effective vaccine world mean safe disregard public health measures pushing now. 

I worry euphoria ""we science going save us!"" going lead lot people dropping guards. thing spreads everyone SEEMS ok yet someone contagious, demonstrated absolutely dumb shit like celebratory ""we it"" parties nobody vaccinated spreads.

we may last spike deaths right alongside vaccination effort :( Stay safe fellow Australian redditors. Thought trying better? Reaching popcorn soda. Uhh, hate break already teachers died early pandemic virtual certainty schools open person teaching. vaccine going 100% effective, know. top people wanting take possibly rushed vaccine point, fucking go it. Japanese bonuses much different view bonus west. bonuses huge part total earnings year (probably around 1/3 people) guaranteed many consider bonus pay withheld. paying bonus less equal western companies raiding pension fund. getting bonus unthinkable Japanese workers. Every country big outbreak miss deaths, they're same.

There's big difference missing 10% 20% deaths missing 70% them. Especially missing deaths deliberately hiding data.  virus doesn’t care. it? really obvious? so, certain shitholes badly? Surely could accept something blatantly obvious take appropriate measures, no? good luck achieving utopia dude, nobody actual power listening us. like agree you, government certain things ISNT there’s almost INCENTIVE it’s IMPRACTICAL suggest people never leave houses reason. like reasons worse others? absolutely. damn need buy household essentials can’t afford shipped house lost job. Literally every illness **can** long term effects. sure people think everyone gets deformed breathless corpse rest lives. looks like right all. It’s re-engineered adenovirus like Oxford one. It’s basically lipid nanoparticle. studied nanoparticles school may little overexcited, also knowledge. I’m confident safe, though. Holy shit, real stat? matching number support executive country? Ah... fanatical religion - always making every single situation worse be. definitely privileged people saying that, everybody cut unnecessary trips out, wear mask necessary time public. People like ones spreading it; people care anyone else think everything kind game need win, even affects others' lives (like Herman Cain). time, government passed national shelter place mandate, along stimulus guaranteed take care everyone 5-6 weeks mask mandate following, one would really discussion four months later. yes, looks like one USA cares people dying covid. Build wall around church, church pay study covid spreads kills there's medical treatment.


This gonna good. yall gonna feel real dumb God comes saves em. &lt;-- /s portion. I've known couple people worked Disney. Yes, park guidelines high standards, end day, people work human. People scared, tired, resentful going take pride jobs may slack. I'm blaming park employees *at all,* mind you. that...a viral pandemic bad time try convince people go life normal go theme parks. whole thing could put bed US already done actual shutdown/quarantine back April May.

But are. Dubya's news distraction fallout patriot act BS lying WMDs Arizona seems dropping also, maybe people starting take action slow spread. Maybe worst over? Meanwhile God: ""I nothing that, shit humans."" gonna work reddit. get downvoted site, view protests time ""needed"" dont really care large groups. ""worth cause"". even though still large gathering, think cause outweighs risk. 

the people telling us ""stay fuck home! dont go church, gatherings eat out!!"" ONES cheering thousands upon thousands people ONE area, gathered protests riots O.o make sense ""...may mere seconds"" still assumption. doubt one single time. may know effective, that's point. That's must complete phase III. Ideally work Oxford also profit motive they’re least partially funded private enterprises (please correct wrong). church also ask listed beneficiary wills? think extrapolating? 1918 still folks wanting wear masks whilst going druggist general store! learned anything plights forefathers?  memes mockery Asians January February agree assessment. say put bottom list medical treatment. marketing swallowing smoke great article. California insurance companies mandated cover cost test go primary doctor feel need one. cases authorize test showing symptoms.

In addition feel like getting test book appointment testing site run county gives tests free anyone wants make appointment symptoms not. link above, president League, suffragist, attorney, labor rights activist Mrs. E.C. Harrington, fierce critic mayor, suggested anti-mask league protests politically motivated.\[6\] debate heated.\[2\] **Some objections ordinance based questions scientific data others considered requirement infringe civil liberties**.\[7\]

so even 1918 messaging even similar reason: politics. nothing changed 100 years. fascinates public health becomes fast issue attached govt control.  

tl;dr social media internet today's messengers politically motivated opposition 100 years earlier social media internet... double tl;dr: haters gonna hate. know Game Thrones culturally relevant anymore, channel Tywin Lannister here: Madness. Madness stupidity. thought already phase 3 human trial? I’ve always found idea megachurches appalling. Whenever see one think myself, “Isn’t better way spend money?”

And...

“If put rock concert every week get people maybe you’re saying wrong things.”

Now:

“If you’re interested want right, might harm least number people, church thing isn’t working.” Better yet. Don’t eat drink aren’t distanced. Honestly, even think  extrapolating 30-90 days 10-15+ years quite stretch. see Harleys Priuses eye - nuisances. drive latter(hand-me-down car, can’t complain) hazards. Social media gives everybody voice. harsh reality people really don’t need heard. hurting , others.

Lol


False. gets sick ( probably would outside immune system greatest)that's one less hospital bed somebody else have


Everybody responsible taking proper precautions. culprit that's wearing mask. victim would staying home.  high risk. Masks replace need social distancing  somebody like especially woman lashes like public camera, imagine acts home Noone see


She could live least outed social services get psych ward jail both.

He's selling country China nothing islands West Philippine Sea, yet wants pick fight Malaysians. He's line waiting Xi's orders, like lap dog. think sees people anymore. mask looks identical feel air getting sucked side without passing filter breath in...it’s particularly great design can’t n95 air doesn’t pass filter. Straight fuck vaccine happens, goes 90 Day Fiancé franchise. bothers $600 week lot people “essential” workers literally would making lost job. 

You make $10 hour working target that’s $400 week. would probably make $800 per week state federal unemployment. 

I feel like money sent people like too. Think like millions years lot humans planet, billions. humans equals space taken up, means chances us coming contact deadly virus Why? don’t get it. It’s praying fasting....No! It’s protest. coronavirus way!

Or could funeral partisan politician. Either way, they’re good. Got covered. 

Thanks Dr. Fauci. 


*because sarcasm lost many here, crowds spread coronavirus. pity tho? long whoever wants get get Kinda like heart stops every time see RBG headlines. work considering current virus shares 80% genome previous original Thank you. isn’t time relaxing spreading misinformation like others thread.

""[Florida’s hidden data skews COVID-19 test count positive test once,” Alina Alonso, head Palm Beach County Department Health, told Palm Beach County commissioners July 7.  count negative tests reasons people testing negative getting multiple test results. positives name captured once,” said.  means person multiple negative tests counted several times.

In state reports, include new individual positivity rates. rates state reports much lower due duplicates negative. example, according [Excel state positivity report 7-day average 11.18% today. new individual positivity rate 18.9% 7-day average. today positivity rate new individuals 17.1% instead 9.28% includes duplicates negative. calculated questioning testing numbers New People got subtracting total negatives ( 3,720,997 -3,199,415=34,450) adding New Cases+New Negative=Total New Tests (7,104 +34,450=41,554 ) excludes Inconclusive ""Awaiting testing"" day. Calculate 7,104 /41,554 =17.1% anyone doubts positivity rate testing numbers check Johns Hopkins.  type positivity rates due people think New Individual Positivity rate misinformation 17.1% since including duplicates negatives. Total Tested check County Report true testing number Negatives found County report stated **"" counts include number people department received PCR antigen laboratory results day. percent number people test positive first time divided people tested day, excluding people previously tested positive.""** add 7,160 + 69,977 =77,137 7,160 /77,137 =9.28% Calculation version similar different positive numbers 7,104 + 69,977 = 77,081 7,104 / 77,081=9.22%.

Both positivity rates make huge difference compare two. Yeah, anyone sane Alabama might wanna head nearest state line right now.... know lady whose granddaughter recently sent Miami work COVID-19 patients. granddaughter RN believe real. hire people work patients don’t believe illness? I'm surprised fired yet. Trump fired every single official who's even 10% competent completely kiss ass. know Dr.Fauci ridiculed sidelined WH every possible occasion, amazing still job. one opposes ruling. Got sources back statement spouting rhetorical drivel? find guy keep going west. previous article read said skin absorption worried since many people using multiple times hour. want add important note regarding hospital bed capacity Japan, highest world specific reason.

Edit: Link 

Aged Cared facilities Japan limited due cultural reason hospitals often get used form age care facility, go regional district hospital full old people often particularly serious illness countries.

I've directly known people (if qualify that) put mother hospital 'health checks' travel business go holiday hospitals seem quite happy oblige obviously essential treatment. I've also known people elderly parents practically live hospital ailments qualify anywhere else.

Given cost/size housing hospital bad, near enough free. Firstly, believe symptoms describing basically bodies normal immune response. Secondly, risk catching COVID-19 personally may small, highly infectious long incubation period chances passing members family public high.  
Do really want one gave Grandma C-19? Remember Dr. Fauci told Americans wear masks? would anyone ever listen again? Looking forward culling herd. Inbred lowlife scummy bikers. Good riddance bad rubbish. national treasure principal ""opening up"" go well, it?  dumb needs stopped market already said fuck everything fast reopening plans One spots ceo criminally liable instead fines, IMHO read linked article would see incorrect.

The agency says cases, methanol appear product label ""not acceptable ingredient drug, including hand sanitizer, even methanol listed ingredient product label."" reason everyone embrace wearing mask. Oh wait.... Oh, isn’t new me. rapid ones accurate tho vaccine work,this virus mutates fast, becoming deadlier deadlier, even quarantines wont work, virus airbone means virus could fly way house infect you. Guys accept it, virus doom. gonna get inevitably killed virus. vaccine work,this virus mutates fast, becoming deadlier deadlier, even quarantines wont work, virus airbone means virus could fly way house infect you.

A lot probably could avoided relaxing requirements US made products - least companies making would known would face consequences using proper ingredients.

And that's even getting clusterfuck disability setup is. mean would give justification go war China grim reaper likes idea. Florida 1 week cases entire region 5 months Abbott ones? changed acceptible specimen apparently helped. tested positive twice now, meaning he's likely actually infected, thus could spread people he's close contact with... presumably includes entire team coaching staff.

Finally intelligent comment. overwhelming optimistic announcements late obscenely unethical. it’s even bothering anyone. don’t get vaccine two months???  point time, say ""we've done educate people."" Let spread coronavirus among mother nature weed weak. ones tracker list appear using placebo people become paranoid, conspiracy-theory believing, undereducated, uncaring tools  Unfortunately lot people genuinely believe soon vaccine approved weeks.

it might be, done. thing covid 19 clearly infectious spanish flu was. spanish flu, deaths within 3 months. thats huge number infected people, way way way covid 19.

The problem least 3 million public school teachers US, counting school staff like principals, admins, nurses, janitors, etc. counting *students*. colleges universities universes people. 

In healthcare, something like 6 million workers hospitals alone. doctors' offices, clinics, nursing homes, on.

Five months pandemic, we're still struggling administer tests, far easier administering vaccines. Finalizing vaccine distributing tens millions people less four months (late Nov) seems wildly optimistic me. BLM: hey, cops stop acting like LARPers real weapons please?

Edit: vigilant careful may played role getting mild case. saying everyone screwed whatevers clever. Taking precautions could protect infection. prevent severe one. worthwhile sure.

Not trying sensational, mod let post today's articles, google see.  See gonzolegend post below. nightmare scenario vaccines fail (no vaccine ever made Coronavirus), natural immunity fades (as common Coronaviruses).

Eradication option - people get serious this, endemic areas need completely sealed off.

Perhaps next Coronavirus spillover (and when, if) transmissible, lethal one? shit Dems want environmental protections arent needed? supposed solve coronavirus? Key Points:

 ""A vaccine could, rare instances, create similar immune storm causes severe illness, particularly children, either vaccine subsequent exposure virus. particular reason believe Covid-19 vaccines cause type overreaction, risk must studied, approval.""

"" Polio vaccination provides cautionary tale. Soon vaccine invented, one manufacturer contaminated batch vaccine, many children became paralyzed. ""

&amp;#x200B;

""**can get people?** Even develop effective vaccine reassuring initial safety record, able get people? Vaccine manufacturing isn’t simple. Failures contamination happen, even experienced pharmaceutical companies—and companies making new vaccines experienced.

And even effective, apparently safe vaccine produced large quantities, difficult distribute quickly equitably, store ship right temperature, educate physicians inform communities monitor uptake possible harmful aftereffects""

&amp;#x200B;

To beat Covid19, need effective public policy buy-in, flexibility vaccine build trust means disperse safely. Even vaccine found, vulnerable still need shelter place others wait LOT time get it. approx 8 billion people world local pass holders, owning timeshares property “use loose it”.

...so now, every american making $100K year bad person? Anyone lives suburbs devil? smart , they'd look politicians forced schools open sheltering place enormous mansions sending brats secluded private schools ... point giving emergency powers executive executive act faster legislatures can, thus appropriate respond emergencies.

The point emergency powers *indeed* react faster. example, need something temporary 2-3 weeks legislators time craft law vote it. spirit emergency powers. going here. attempt codifying measures law. reason, suspect, insufficient widespread support among voters laws. actual vote, law regarding masks, example, may well fail. 

And problem. democracy, majority people decide legal isn't. could, technically remove women's right vote, amending constitution, perfectly legal democracy. democracy, majority people want mask wearing laws, irrelevant whether wearing masks beneficial public health, whether saves lives, anything.  

So important? Upholding principles democracy public health? Christian, infuriating. First all, Biblically inaccurate. Bible explicitly says test God Luke 4:12, says ""And Jesus answered him, “It said, ‘You shall put Lord God test.’ Secondly, following logic means anytime felt slightly sick never go doctor since ""it's time."" Change scenario sickness like cancer would zero second guessing going doctor everything doctor says. reddit love communism people non-sports subreddits think sports bad teachers get paid much Lebron makes sense Central Alabama. exactly recommend move here, good comparison housing costs. Would vaccine distributed freely would pay? Everyone trying boost overall immunity: alcohol, lowering bad cholesterol sugar, supplementing vitamins needed, getting fresh air sun least 30 mins day light cardio, sleeping solid 8 hours. Dont overdo it. Wear mask avoid people.

Those top head... Yep. crusty places last clean tf unless they're middle nowhere.

Gus's Good Times Deli Knoxville, TN almost got permanently shut unsanitary equipment - place campus staple walls covered decades football player country music signatures.

I loved steamed subs, stopped visiting getting sick third time row. couple days later saw TV they'd gotten **63** health score immediately fix stay open, imagine - I'm brave enough test that.

Oh ffs, dont tell land free beat someone park! ITT people understand every school afford go virtual, many (poor) parents rely school lunch, many children escape broken/abusive homes via school.

Not every household school iPads, Laptops, even bedroom child. Imagine single bedroom households 2-3 children trying attend virtual class.

It amazes people ""champion poor"" (more like virtue signal) idea actually like poor families school actually provides many beyond simply education. ....so whats real number? I'm Serbian, family moved America 9, brother turning 6 year came. Prior coming freedom world. ran around neighborhood day till knees week tummy rumbled. parents worked home grandmother provide meals, company discipline needed. played outside time school studying.

Upon moving everything changed also nothing changed. biggest change psychological. ""knew"" supposed alone, also ""knew"" they(government, people) found alone would get taken parents. parents barely keeping us water, money left after-school programs babysitters also knew need that. years learned cook(yes 9), mom would often times cook large portions coming home work. ran meal would pull ingredients(defrost meat) fix brother meal school. would hide mostly room school, never open door knock came, always pretending alert anyone two children cared for. 

It unusual nothing bad came it, 20 years younger brother laugh way raised ourselves(we given strong foundation early life). Im sure going this, think wanted give personal take something might come norm here. wait tries delay election due pandemic Man senate makes Palpatine look like good option Although ""person charge"" media front certainly trying mask blame shifting towards China. I'm Asian American think point it'll come creating false blame somewhere direct unchanneled anger. Let's stop thankful cool Canada becoming American-free. lifetime event. people never got see this, future may never. now. get this. get free Canada, pure Canada, clean Canada. Let polarized SJWs Trump-supporters kill off. That's wild. First World War Korean War combined

It's yet. US still chance reach million dead. whole year everybody? go fund page? lot people come post stuff well garbage like ""Oh yeah well deaths?!?"" literal pile corpses front yard somehow evidence we're getting ass kicked pandemic. won't. big majority deaths people 60+ diseases. Bulk deaths 60 obese people. Well trump wouldnt issue first place hypothetical situation.

I live america one thing i've learned pandemic people fucking terrible. hope kid smart enough realize parents forced him/her go school his/her will. VAST majority people die COVID die COVID. %500 increase pneumonia deaths COVID, means COVID caused deaths stupid. Key words ""official total""

With sudden unexplained uptick ""pneumonia"" ""other"" deaths 2020, likely happened awhile ago realistically That’s insane. don’t smoke, find insane. 

And really want try South African wine. recommend? (sadly) aware SA wine industry would like support can. nothing value lost. Maybe nice side effect shit people realizing kind materialistic bullshit matter Hopefully guilt become anger. rural areas outside city 15 mins. lived Chicago, average work day 11 hours, plus weekends, 24-28 hour calls. way hell going commute “less expensive area” didn’t even energy eat dinner shower days. 

Just you’re unaware constraints people may have, doesn’t mean don’t exist. WFH becoming reality, pattern may change. don’t luxury tho. reduce consumption addicts need ""here now""  made several false assumptions. First argue yes everyone eventually get it, nearly everyone. say mask effective preventing that. not. mask keep transmitting. Wearing mask order stop coronavirus akin putting chain link fence order stop mosquitoes. argument relapse due body forgetting antibodies needed order combat virus, there's really much hope vaccine. least one dose vaccine. would entirely different issue. argument elderly, immunocompromised, another person's underlying health issues risk valid. That's strongly suggest people isolate themselves, instead trying quarantine larger healthier population. there's economic impact virus well. what's government money finally runs out, we're going see bad is. need stay getting many people back work can. Sweden done fine job this. made hard call order keep economy social structures wrecked like were. say hard call knew would death , anyway greater good. need to.

Sadly, much information get virus politicized election year policies left. election year, Common Sense things could would already taken place. hope Trump come say absolutely loves puppies, wholesale Slaughter canine species left America would devastating sad. could early tests gave false positives ""reinfections"" actually initial infections. least slightly alleviates one concern twenty something; there’s going whole generation kids one school year dumber be. help stay relevant job market. dementy cool all, still looking exact lie Fauci told public. 

I remember people telling me, buy masks low supply. remember people telling me, wearing mask helps others helps me. remember Fauci (or scientist) telling me, masks work all. 

So please: provide actual quote actual lie Fauci told Februar/March. completely full seem like already drank kool-aid looking opinion changed

Fuck too, guess. think consumed one many schnapps. That’s **all** bills work. Always. 

What doesn’t work sitting three months refusing even discuss it. one side does. damn disgrace. probable cause? past four years example ""don't talk politics dinner table"" worst idea ever. understand difficult stay home. I’ve taken pretty seriously, haven’t even building that’s house since March feel like I’m starting go crazy.

Hell, lately part trying justify taking cross-country road trip purely fun it, even though I’ve never wanted one would probably never want outside quarantine. 

I’m trying keep spirits looking good news vaccines planning things post-covid see people worse situations (and haven’t known anyone personally affected yet) give staying home, unfortunately.

(But also shouldn’t ignore amount people flat-out refuse understand severity situation. That’s way fucking high.) Well may get 1200 uncle sugar that's 1520$ Thanks..  right way? I'm anxiously awaiting test results today even though think know unfortunate answer, never thought ask contact though, assume either email phone call? Upgrades people, upgrades Yep. right timing. 1,571 number would match early mid May, depending upon source looking at. Covid Tracking us 1,582 May 13. cases deaths still surging NYC, probably yet real handle many *actually* virus, still putting people ventilators way sooner doctors know else lot cases. *lots* people dying, comparison number known cases had.

So yeah, think right. know they're getting 11,000 number, doubt much chance correct. *certainly* pretty much inevitable, OP implies. 😅😅😅THEY KEEP FAKE AZZ ,PRE-PLANNED VACCINE, GOT PATENT VACCINE CORONAVIRUS YEARS AGO....IM GOOD.....HAVE EVER TOLD VACCINE CONSIST OF??? DOUBT IT!!

That's people said hundreds thousands dead, look Testing unless get results back 2-4 hours pointless.

Update later Yawn. Thought so. vaccine single important means control COVID, massively misunderstood. easy exits pandemic, even vaccine. 

Dr. Frieden (CDC Director 2009 2017) writes 3 huge hurdles overcome. well, around 30% popualtion addicted cut supply... Essential workers absolutely highest priority vaccine distrubution. Grocery workers, delivery drivers, healthcare. knocking elderly want target exposed ones front line this. Also [40% country story going become tragically common schools reopen. Already voting Biden. Let support there's chance hell I'm voting Jones either. think safe assume official figures underreported. Governments expectedly want save face also lot uncertainty people show visible symptoms go radar testing isolating. Worse, Texas

Atleast Arizona beautiful mom fight able work home. works public sector GBG. Basically middle management seemed either afraid take decisions unless CLEAR official recommendations decisions higher ups. several others got together put pressure boss got even thou tools necessarily keep working.

I many examples like think clear strong actions early could gotten ball rolling earlier saved people.

There many reasons needed order write another wall text large I'd say heavy generalisation strong urge stand even makes sense hard one say wear mask. Secondly firmly believe systemic issues within public sectors promote taking actions. get punished inaction failure act rather really want crisis situation. I’m noticing unless statistics really “scare” people, they’re willing either pay attention something it. Even right now, people downplaying situation using “low” death rate validate either reopening schools economy, least US we’re headed nasty direction. think time shaming. Exactly, Pelosi bill months ago. might agree can't say care. Republicans basically refuse look it. Remember viral doctor video last week seem ~20 million? Yup, basically one primary claims danger kids kids couldn’t spread  Auto fill got me.......aren't clever

That's hoping response pandemic? imagine may young remember time period properly.

It's surprising people getting families killed refusing wear masks refusing isolate. that's true, vaccine last two months well. guess we're dead. Might well live life then. That’s true. live close hospital. Constant sirens. went quick walk around block figured needed exercise. Spotted 3 different ambulances parked outside 3 different buildings. cried way home. Family Midwest completely floored told them. awful. Works me. 133% Americans die January died tha first hit US. Absolutely. anti-maskers wouldn’t happy went scratched sweaty balls made sandwich gloves claim it’s right wear gloves compare crisis states? Lots countries soft lock downs, including Sweden's Gällivare. see problem long count negatives antigen tests either skews numbers, long every positive antigen test followed reliable test counted. everything same. Everyone Sturgis wear mask social distance, like protests. totally feel you, bro. isn’t now, sure shit couple weeks. getting paid dependent passing something, rich people would Congress, poor afford job. Consistent Congressional salaries matter. scientists could reliably raise immune systems keep up, they'd already it.

You assuming lot here. greatly improved health immune strength, hardly scientists medical person would promote doing. stop tried would come regardless 30% population disordered. go around dealing time. Many times questioning wtf happened. need make seven billion ship every person planet make sure take them. Easy peasy. comment contains joke

Why can't dinosaurs talk?
Because they're dead! feel like comparing current events isn’t accurate thing do. Wasn’t flu way worse? way deadlier? means multiple small business friends set up...  people dying SA per day US I’m sure mean. You’re supposed put face tho Yeah, French kiss eat ass there. Let's see get beds double capacity! Many studies large proportion hospitalized patients. outcomes probably worse average. atrocious idea huge overreaction would ruin lives. literally hundreds ideas better this. no, they'll say they're ""doing something"" reason scream asking healthcare next election, guy raped children genocide candidate. what, allow people come without quarantine?

It suck, appreciate that, we're middle pandemic, anyone visiting hotspot need follow proper channels keep Canadians safe.

All recent cases Atlantic Canada people travelling USA. NS, student quarantine ended infecting others. Meanwhile NL, worker returned home, quarantined, infected one.

Quarantine works, makes sense bend rules anyone unless completely necessary (ex. truckers bringing food/supplies). Hospital withdrawn usual bonus. walk out.

Why would work riskier environment less pay say another 200,000 end Trump’s term. None close friends know anyone it, helped. article misinformation.

Sweden lockdown Gällivare.

They lock deem necessary. agree except late November bit ambitious. Optimistic estimates first vaccine proven effective place September, that's Oxford, I'd say middle road estimate 1-2 vaccines approved November, high-risk /exposure individuals vaccinated end January. point I'm glad government agency able make even short term extrapolations current data trends. low bar, know... favorite Brix quote:

Test positivity remains ~4% ~2%, reproductive number virus likely hovering 1. We’re still much lower test positivity March April like 15%. number real infections February–April surely much higher confirmed numbers.

There thankfully relatively deaths (about 10 past month, 61 overall); hope aren’t many more.

I’d say “surging” bit misleading description. “Holding steady moderately higher prevalence 2 months ago” closer fair description.

It would great could push numbers much lower though (please don’t throw house parties people). There’s still significant risk community, fewer cases, easier contact tracing isolation. would also great increased supply tests. Appointments city’s free testing sites long lead time.

Lol went like 2 days ago said another post hate people exaggerating spreading lies...it completely empty walk EVERY ride, cast members wearing masks face shields, temp checks throughout park rides spaced out, cast members yelling every 10-20 feet masks properly...it honestly pretty damn somber depressing...so idea article talking cause blatant lie...I live Florida gone past 3 weeks week cause Disney give refund pass wasn't, main income 1099 made enough income w2 gigs eligibility UI based can't mix match 1099 w2 earnings. w2 income 2k spread quarter majority income count towards benefit amount. reality probably making around 35-40k/year told. 

And saving everything rent/utilities/groceries paid CC debt still run fast nothing much coming in. choose one thing fast like chocolate television Fifth - CDC never, ever said masks perfectly effective catching/stopping virus. reducing spread distance impeding *airflow*. semi-permeable barrier directly outflow air vent, air going able travel nearly far. masks. aid social distancing, anyone thinks used lieu social distancing, they're going bad time. Neither masks 6' social distancing effective themselves, become effective used jointly. 

They're much inconsistent recommendations *evolving* recommendations learn virus. knew everything immediately, whole situation would look different. Keep mind nobody's really faced anything magnitude since 1918.

Sixth - Concerning readmission nursing homes, quick google search shows CDC advising screening every single resident restricted visitor access early April 2nd. may earlier ones, spend much time looking.

Seventh - HELL would reopen schools fall? Even virus super deadly kids, large majority kids immunocompromised family members transmit disease to. not, even small percentage, percentage childrens death become acceptable? teachers cases asked fill wills returning classrooms? thinks good idea??

Eighth - Concerning everybody likely getting virus... exactly think whole 'Flatten Curve' thing about? quarantines never intended make virus magically go away - purpose give hospitals breathing room least attempt keep ICUs overrun. overload ICUs, deaths go dramatically.

I'm saying Fauci flawless - saying he's done best dumpster fire he's handed, current administration large part American people done everything power limit effectiveness. exactly you, people got quit trusting opinions science. Never saw penny applied 6 times since start. last week received another letter saying eligible 0 dollars. Even PUA came out, everytime filed Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (meant independents) quoted eligible 0.00 benefits didnt business set last tax season. I've living savings ever since January client died pneumonia. work home care directly affected people want strangers coming house compromised loved one many moved home take care themselves. Indeed. ""level 4"" lockdown gave virus much less opportunities spread compared ""stage 4"" lockdown Melbourne doing. medical frontlines providing food supermarket/dairy, people home unless nipping groceries.

Even may strict NZ's lockdown (and curve flattened turned around quickly) hope enough Melbourne get grip situation. Right looks like runaway train. Petri dish. !remindme 30 days couple clarifications:

- posted Reddit before

- knowledgeable commenters said specific states North-east India. someone originally South India, never heard recently.

- agree India held standards China. wet market could source tomorrow's pandemic needs shut today.

- India especially needs figure wet markets conventional meat (fish, chicken, mutton (goats) pork make 90% meat find across country). Especially South India meat consumption really high 97% states), seen wet markets every street corner. kind unhygienic slaughter source risk, even sourced animals widely consumed? order answer question need know: 

* A. % population needs infected (or successfully vaccinated) order reach herd immunity (this varies disease disease, can't answer question) 
* B. effectiveness vaccine (which obvious reasons one answer). 

So...... hard question answer. under-estimate importance question B. support demands see achieving season starts. someone already pointed out, season starts likely going short. MLB case study without thousands on-campus students cramded campus three months. interesting one way other. Pffft, jokes libtards! They’re dead now! / flu vaccine same, takes weeks immunity. body goes process developing immunity course weeks. start leave pharmacy.

Your statement healthy people affected completely false. think someone tell totally possible pray fast HOME? club ""get rid wet markets, whether India, China, country."" Think average american stupid? Realize half average First off, shut state testing centers, east coast. Second, test results far delayed you’re seeing results today least week ago, one day testing centers closed. dismissive lacking empathy. capitalist boots taste? Yeah think people relaxing America epicentre Covid. better Americant. amazes progress masks hundred years. Since knew viruses would come around periodically, (several since 2000) shouldn’t masks improved shouldn’t everyone one replaceable filters, UV cleaning system? Referring baseball. spring training expanded rosters field two teams simultaneously everyone gets reps concur  countries reporting tests different. I’m insinuating South Africa Mexico aren’t telling truth countries like China instance definitely fudged numbers. Even US states have. It’s hard take numbers face value time, instead investing military, invest healthcare workers treat war injuries

No silly, vets also get really crappy healthcare, invest money channel towards killing enemies obtaining pull government controls commodity market for- fighting corona would save American lives administration made clear care whether affiliated military (bounties) (corona) expense. moeny time work take leave. Nevermind medical bills without insurance thought Texas issue rapid result kits throw results April  dad finally came around virus real Herman Cain died, still insists isn’t pandemic nobody knows personally knows anyone caught it. Don’t really know say get come around, point I’ll happy ever get pull mask nose. split squad? look data death rate actually good evidence mortality young people WAY lower people 40. getting sick hospitalized. evidence low youth mortality rate, [CDC shows 16 people 18 died 52,000. That's less 0.1 percent less 1 1,000. Yet US population made 22% percent 18 years old said, stupidity assuming get bring home likely get give another friend relative vulnerable. incubation period long show symptoms, might spreading 10 days show symptoms. would awful live w/ knowing might infected killed someone line. Certainly wound teacher cared respected trying get education shit salary. really dont understand responded comment this. complete non-sequitur. guess is, like live, sheriff's department refusing enforce coronavirus orders governor. makes wonder long first, like doctors, nurses, essential workers , poor people cant afford without job, etc hope deniers get penatly sorts (although would also cause spread) Nothing say matters never cite anything play ignorant everything else. hilarious. trained attack eagles, aya John, attack faceless men masks.  !remindme 30 days mean people 1918 didn’t destroy economy never thought would “new normal “ went straight roaring 20s thought still infecting people? vaccine from, Atari?

Just like said cases rise deaths couple weeks ago.

Can't catch goal posts move. Africa get stereotypes aint threat yet. Wait start develop news begin flow I'm sorry loss. Fuck everyone whose ignoring this.

Jesus, take wheel. Often quality luck though 🤷‍♀️ Prayers Dougie P. Seems like may fine hopefully stays way. Spend less time stalking time learning proper grammar &amp; spelling. FUCKING THIS.

This normie Americans miss. country built selfish greed. Fauci Co let slip masks priority item? Holy fuck we’d fucked were.

Even denying masks general public, still PLENTY scumbags bought mask supplies price gouge. It’s American way.

Same way every hurricane season florida people buy generators, bottled water, etc. Maybe fuckin sporting two seconds how's difference cult religion good marketing is. Christianity disease mind preventing country making progress. Maybe US meant Alabama. Trust bloody experts study stuff living. Trust scientists doctors make specialty! Bay area LA area reversed pandemic compared 1918. human sacrifice appease Sata(n)Rona. Fuck you. People like depend sports make living. posted article could make comment post.

I approve. 9/11 Wasnt many people died, way people died. outright attack Americans terrorists. ensuing months maybe years, fear palpable bc anything protect yourself. Nobody knew /when/ next attack would take place that's rememebered. bc number people. understand people keep comparing two. Let rephrase. Maybe China comparably worse. woman makes rappe claim cop also say investigate amount women caught lying seexuall abuse cop say hang cop, curious operate post history seem suggest honest people around drug dealing thugs. understand, WH gets hospital data, think includes tests.

The testing numbers likely flattened partly people took precautions mostly testing capacity capped results week+ places hard hit.  really better visibility tests taken, tests returned age tests returned. failed wear mask wore improperly charged disturbing peace, warned subsequent violations, fined jailed. city health officer mayor paid fines wearing masks boxing match.

I feel like there's lesson learned  major problem r/covid19 allow news articles great synthesizing facts together. Let alone space experts quoted whether news article expert's twitter reaction scientific articles. COVID19 makes assumption scientific articles combined anonymous reddit users playing armchair epidemiologists statisticians enough understand pandemic.

With regards pandemic, trust bloody experts study stuff living. Trust scientists doctors make specialty! They're using independent lab, impact rest testing system It’s factual. original post said teachers likely going get sick die. aren’t going likely get sick die. preface saying distance learning help keep teachers healthy even go back school, aren’t going likely get sick die. totally feel ya dude. grandparents quarantining right exposure person tested positive covid, yet went daily life mask delivering food everyone neighborhood.

It's tough day. Fucking hell yall think self righteous anger gonna save world keep warm night

And need push back election. VOTER FRAUD!  LatAm, Brazil, extremely poorly right now, international media covering much.

Seriously, gotta wonder Fauci even shows work point maintains composure whlle surrounded group White House. boiling internally. word word said:

My guess pandemic late November means anything research nose isn’t covered mask isn’t much. Doesn’t matter think know. Facts facts stupid say something factual? get it. Agreed.

Now imagine 1918, without internet 2020 comforts.

Any audacity complain, stop now. Thanks.  fact people personal biases eachother, due political affiliations, get decide fates us sickening sobering... two ideas aren’t mutually exclusive.

The sport antiquated leadership antiquated. It’s symptom - disease. likely healthcare, government personal, high officials... Every article great news, good news fades away nothing.  One large coffee. say cop? gonna spit it? And? think cases magically stopped rising point?

If look daily new cases, pretty much flat April May. end May, cases started going slowly, accelerated late June. Yes, states, like California, started reopening June protests ended add fuel fire, there's denying protests lit kindling.

I know woke people refuse believe protests partly blame COVID-19 deaths disproportionately killing black brown people today, that's honest truth.

If going call idiots partying Daytona Beach spring break, also need call people decided protesting (out public middle global pandemic) killing African Americans hands law enforcement important stopping disease end killing blacks one year cops killed past decade. Injustices responsible both, protesting one form injustice, manner done, greatly amplified point making first almost insignificant terms sheer numbers.

Before go thinking sympathetic cause, let say that's case all. am, public protests could waited another time still powerful, moreso. scumbag LEO eventually going tried. Whenever time comes whatever verdict would opportunity speak out, protest, riot, whatever else needed get anger out.

Instead look what's happened? COVID-19 disaster absolutely dominated media focus. name deceased (can't mention name without getting post flagged) hardly ever uttered news days. Sure, statues taken Washington football team finally got name change, cost things now? cost tens thousands lives African Americans. counting. cares, let die, tired hearing shit. Guess don’t remember cop tried investigate McDonald’s employee taking bite sandwich. Come find cop “forgot” took bite sandwich. That's game rich people play horses right? Apes Dude shit cracking literally said vaccine come November misinformation said American opinions wrong misinformation like sheesh person us almost month. lot issues. remember nurses freaking D/Cd, want pull IV site. get Doctorate qualify medical assertions? Good good Need type action everywhere religious leaders defy rules course I'd find wild posting shitty meme. Totally! Basically production ramp good results/effectiveness good too, could pretty nice winter... Looking forward results coming out! ""because he's sick trouble breathing"" Wow, football game? home. companies employees required test 2 times negative go work tested positive. Health care workers sport players test every couple days-every week counted negative. testing numbers much higher new individuals test due retesting. Wait... Cruises going right now?? First mess everything people government. 

If people government also find mask suppliers all/most people government would probably mask wear time (if they're within families medical workers). Yes may argue way sell give masks, least monetary prices reasonable enough. 

Yes many necessities shortage people hoarding things, problem exist among pro-government anti-government sides please solely blame people government this. among anti-government side, soon received message spread wider telling people hoard things instead (their also similar messages pop-govt side). tell you, matter hoarding things government, feel disgusted. 

The main fault government relying much self-discipline resellers, leading many crazily raising mask prices. want praise Macau much, see government allowing things happen? Stupid question: would FDA approve rushed COVID vaccine might otherwise fail clinical trials Europe? I’m anti-vaxxer 3-year-old date vaccines, around decades studied long time. I’m bit concerned given rushed vaccine. Given government pharmaceutical business tendency corrupt (the opioid crisis example) I’d apt trust Europe seems safe, makes sense. wondering hypothetically fails trials Europe allowed sale there, would FDA still release here? Try articulating not.

And yes, know definition *may* is. FFS. think I'm moron? originally Sweden moved 2 years ago. I've lived Europe family friends countries locked different ways. personal opinion anecdotal witness statement - outside media might say Sweden lockdown felt (and still feels) does. working home since mid-March almost friends. People formed small ""social bubbles"" lower feeling isolation, still kept distant. Everyone's behavior, even people know pre-pandemic quite irresponsible, altered dramatically. One friends, works job outdoors (and away people) told life mostly normal - still goes work, goes gym, watches movies, sees friends. asked parents (this back May) told - hear phone seen weeks. live city would visit every days prior, big family lunches weekends normally. said - work outdoors still go gym, cannot risk mom (in risk group) catching me, keep distance. late May went drop presents waved garden door. 

I friends work/live cities others families. Even infection rates going would still reluctant say would travel see them. Nobody wants infect close ones nobody sure unintentionally. people careful. People careful (and honestly, expect be) young people - teens 20s. friends 30s would alternate going bar club Saturday week self-isolation make sure still healthy. good enough imo, still shows changed behavior.

People/Friends/Colleagues I've discussed - swedish response, lack lockdown, delayed drop infections, closed borders countries - mixed responses. Everyone happy things improving now, everyone unhappy year crappy (in whole world) get normal holiday, visit family abroad, things planned. people think Sweden done differently made sure self-isolate even harder. 

On national level, say thanks official enquires surveys. support Public Health Authority still high -[i think report , I've listened briefing presentations; Hospitals Public Health authority still highest confidence country - 76 67%, Board Health Welfare (responsible elderly care) 42%. levels confidense stable little diminished start (I think first report shows 81% 77% respectively end May). support government general dropped (58% start 45% now) visible European countries think artifact strategy.

Anything else means impossible know deity wants do.

This inherently true. take solia scriptura approach might make argument.

But sect goes combination scripture, traditions practices handed directly days apostles centuries long discussions meanings certain revelations. 

It safe literalistic text recorded re-recorded humans. 

Other types religions relationships texts can’t make arguments don’t enough background make informed disagree. knowing something wrong prevent wrong thing responsible it.

I say prevents wrong responsible. fact said shield anyone else consequences. human world, ignorance law excuse someone fined jailed leaving campfire unchecked owe debt society causing peril destruction natural resources.

But within reason. child wouldn’t fined jailed setting fire, parents might fined could still affect child.

But perspective divine judgment, divine knows limited knowledge say child, mentally handicapped person human who’s never seen fire authority release human debt destroying habitat.

Likewise, murder law God, person acting extreme duress psychotic delusion leniently dealt God death someone killed cold blood, even though consequences murder still exist would humans contain someone threat society even means robbing cannot comprehend concept dichotomy without knowledge it. lived dark whole life could comprehend light matter one described could tell difference light dark. would reference.

This also inherently true. Humans capable abstract thought. never experienced physical torture physical abuse hands another human being. Never life, live pretty safe comfortable life. Yet comprehend abstract sense gravity severity experience. 

I never experienced anything close starvation chronic thirst rationally grasp horrible must be.

The point is, Adam Eve represent humans rational beings, capable abstract thought understanding moral concepts even earliest period human experience beginnings moral reasoning. believe evolution, christian, theory evolution goes deity says.

No doesn’t. literalist sect.

For someone wants away organized religion really invested upholding repressive ideas religious doctrine possible. 

If case clergy sect committing apostasy decades. Big Bang theory first proposed Catholic priest named Georges Lemaitre. Hubble based research groundwork Lemaitre laid. theory holds development earth life necessarily took astronomically long time. accept amount time took planets form are, accept concepts like geological time eons genetic changes earth organisms.

The Catholic Church require belief in, accepts possible development species evolutionary processes. 

I don’t understand literalists want deny God creative process ability set motion cosmic mechanisms little complicated simply speaking things existence.

Why would God want people take text recorded flawed people live according surface level understanding possible? ever actually read Bible? old New Testament riddled people who, despite covenants God constantly messing held examples even helped. 

You lot opinions religion says deity says. ever sat dialogue actual Christian theologians? even read work them? 

Or ideas Christian cosmology theology works come either worst examples find outsiders strong opinions narrow exposure Christian philosophy? moment proud state! Yay! Go Dr. Lee! Wonder kids take revenge school? live, nurses firemen can't strike.

Resources get tainted honestly can’t say much. slowly started get better. messed times trying exercise thought felt better would set back. 
I took vitamin Emergen-C. 

Currently I’m still feeling better I’m feelings things kicking back again. Like coughed bit today palpitations coming going, I’m getting weird breathy tightness chest eye feels weird, eyes infected whole time sick got better that’s felt much better, little redder gunky morning. 

I don’t sleep enough, start taking sleep aid would knock force sleep. helped. month ago Swedish health official said regretted herd immunity attempt, many people died compared Scandinavian countries. Kinda like opposite panspermia hypotheses Red Robin? would wonder less whole overall lung capacity due existing altitude extended period time. two months Colorado cardio best ever I've slowly lost since leaving need tattoos say refuse professional medical care get COVID. That's nice

Will pregnant forever? going see unemployment, we’re going see hunger crime. average person anything reckless one two drinks. People drink excess, that's another story, see people things listed. Drinking problem, drinking much *and* making poor decisions problem. Dont get vaccinated then. Im mother. chances getting sick cv19 exponentially worse vaccine. you. point discussion point risk harm receiving vaccine extremely low certainly less getting covid. Open container laws ridiculous anyway. It’s perfectly legal consume alcohol within legal limit walk park, walking park. It’s driving. glass wine dinner fine driving home, can’t drink beer driving home. whole “it would increase drunk driving” thing could easily addressed doubling tripling dui penalties open container involved. letting people buy drink meander around outside go back another one no-brainer. course, staying home would safer seems like fair compromise. latest example Americans infecting Canadians presence determines presence FDA’s list one hand santiizer methanol aka wood alcohol “can toxic absorbed skin,” agency states hand sanitizers methanol unsuitable marketplace.

TIL True.......  go wrong? I’m certainly getting US-made vaccine. heard there’s one Ohio built church. not. 

hospitalizations rising.

Deaths rising. Sorry condescending portion last sentences, read like done nothing sway people convince make sound like easy. Probably mean sound way.

&amp;#x200B;

I agree saying I'm giving still, merely framing easy get people back vote full force election definitely there. ....and wonder people aren’t taking seriously. like leadership favorite fox entertainment channel howling months it’s “nothing dem hoax” “Dr. Fauci doesn’t like Trump” or...oh, wait second. *monkey state opens bars, resturants, cinemas malls yes open schools. 

Schools way above. open hospital, don’t take valuable space away sick people didn’t inadvisable things? Source? like older people health conditions, expected get first,

I thought trail phase 3 study Fauchi talking different vaccine? anti-mask people idiots would found excuse. don’t give fuck think latest talking point parroting. Last week HCQ. week it’s Fauci. cult repeating cult leaders tell say. 

And I’m sorry, people hoarded toilet paper. alternative would far worse people didn’t trust still trusting you. take cult members whining doctors nurses dying every day week.

Plus dont forget hamster test That’s quite idealistic. I’m sure poor families would appreciate told can’t feed family 8 weeks “for greater good”.

One year ago, restaurant cited unsanitary unsafe restaurant conditions restaurant refused close comply health codes, almost one would saying, ""The restaurant allowed serve dirty food unsafe way authorities back off."" 

This different. really wish people would learn difference minor cytokine storm response vaccine actually sick. Long terms effects pretty rare, typical safety protocol three months, also rigorous phase IV/survalliance meaning catch anything quickly know fuck words mean, I'm going check out. Thanks. :) finding out? correct, based Theory people live space virus non existent. “lifes work” places around still getting enough to-go orders survive. Even tiny little daiquiri hole-in-the-wall spot still kicking. don’t need 1000 pizza/pho/burger joints. don’t need 1000 shitty “behind gas station” bars. Let fail. It’s waste. What’s GMA? human beings do. isn’t truly unique phenomenon America, it’s coming bad leadership allowed virus fester beyond initial “lockdown” period. 

It’s reason abstinence-only sex education doesn’t work 1,758 cases Harris County today (Houston) Swing miss. itch ache like crazy arm get flu shot day two. scratch keep trucking. Better sidelined flu week two, worse. feel vaccine. many unknowns sure are, especially since isn’t area expertise. don’t see clear reason propose it’s safe, beyond relativistic things like generally safe tested certain issues like imminent toxicity. don’t see that’s totally air tight, okay. Without long term studies, part left faith theoretical. sure, lots medicines market either potentially dangerous don’t sufficient long term studies. That’s great thing seems depend country's legislation. comment full simile metaphor could considered poem. also found decreased severity disease. Getting vaccines peoples body's take time, exactly right. soon news hits vaccine made, see first 'wave' positive results, like economic uptick hopefully state/national policy help people get vaccinated. people start getting vaccinated, second 'wave' millions millions people saving tons money, ready spend everything 2020. expect lot businesses healthy bounceback, especially hard hit ones restaurant hospitality.

Also, word ""severe"" interesting. whole point we're trying determine severe illness is. severe another severe infection still something concerned about. Don’t care. Still getting available. learned administer IV fluids Army Combat Lifesaver Course. Basically, battalion medics came spent two days teaching mechanics, clerks, refuelers bare minimum keep patient alive battlefield actual professionals could get there.

Mild climate locations likely recover dine outdoors time. Otherwise restaurants north far south supposed do? headline makes explicit, active statement cannot attributed quotes. ""warn against"" mentioned previously recommend countries lockdown statement fact - active measure time. also spoke new tools employed contain virus going forward. None speaks warning performing particular action, think fair summary. get injection every three months arm always hurts got it. NBD. Fake news. Covid death numbers faked. Individual anecdotes children struggling online learning prove kids can't succeed online learning period.  novel idea. way could get vote 3000 month including adjusting future inflation UBI. turning around literally everything. /r/thathappened think /u/Darthdonkey81 actually read peer-reviewed journal article he's touting.

For one thing, piece 2.5μm particulate matter *pollution.* smaller droplet nuclei, transmission risk Covid-19 comes respiratory droplets 5-10μm range. Respiratory droplets also likely particulate matter size get caught something like cotton cotton *really, really hydrophilic.*

More importantly, article discusses protection mask provides *to wearer.* We'll circle back second.

He's technically correct saying wash/dry cycles decrease filtering efficiency measured washing drying cycle four cycles shown Fig. 5. found gradual decrease filtering efficiency increase washing drying cycle. compared unwashed mask efficiency ∼63%, 4th washing drying cycle ∼20% drop filtering efficiency.

However, misses lot crucial context. First, machine-washing drying pretty hard textiles: there's reason lot delicate garments' instructions say hand wash hang dry. hand takes roughly two minutes, tenth time many us would happily devote taking shit. *worst*-case scenario, pretending moment 2.5μm pollution particulate data actually corresponds 5-10μm respiratory droplets, that's 20% reduction effectiveness *not* ""totally ineffective.""

So 20% reduction effectiveness mean us? Letting people walk around masks 100% effective sounds like recipe disaster, right? part *everyone* wearing masks, masks be, average, 40% effectively control community spread. everyone's wearing masks 60-90% effective, goes even farther toward controlling transmission *we ability safety loosen restrictions actually costing us economically socially*.


Remember talked article focusing *protecting wearer*? Yeah, ~~we've~~ actual big-boy big-girl scientists known wearing masks provide lot protection community whole, protect individual wearer little. brings mask-wearing needs remain mandatory: public benefit, means people care community own, get selfish people wear mandatory enforced fines.

tl;dr Wear fucking masks, people. makes sense though. Guardian always giant gray box talking Trump USA. Also spells words way lot time instead British way sometimes even notice British reading it. know hero. article good paywall saying thing? Yes, currently isnt vaccine corona virus. Prior 2012 wasnt really demand develop one. 8 years development drug reach phase 3 drug trials ""operation warp speed"" put doesnt really change process. drug phase III trials right now, they're measuring antibody levels people received vaccine. Early results indicate antibody levels 3-4x infected CV19. positive result. Ultimately trial post results idea efficacy. drug efficacious vaccine take. I’ve mindset months protect home unfortunately. sucks can’t convince ppl don’t care. Everyone else careful Good News Everyone. Bad news doomers. say there's enough people run trials cuz virus waning Don’t try use logic people talking UBI it’s printing money. us favor. anywhere...it's ok.

Been stuck head months. can’t? pro-literalism making uneducated assumptions simplify problem religion you?

When comes believing book contains orders deity live life literalism possible option. Anything else means impossible know deity wants example would culpable setting fire forest know harmful consequences. prehistoric human encountering fire first time would morally culpable didn’t know better, consequences remain. 

I disagree. knowing something wrong prevent wrong thing responsible theory Adam Eve comprehended evil good exist distinct. knew moral gravity choosing evil, hadn’t experienced hadnt introduced concept them. went ahead propagated it.

One cannot comprehend concept dichotomy without knowledge it. lived dark whole life could comprehend light matter one described could tell difference light dark. would believe evolution, much Christian sect does, see humans acquiring sophisticated sense morality modern brains becoming increasingly aware consequences actions still choosing participate even experiencing harm. meaning willful evil, sin culpable.

If believe evolution, christian, theory evolution goes deity says. government, *anything* telling do?


If I’m walking street see Tawmmy glorified intellectualism shaking toddler, say, “Hey man, it’s probably good shake baby...” I’m likely met with, “That’s none fucking business!” escalating there.

People like places diseases restrictions. want somewhere feels ""normal"" stop consider might infected/be part problem. U.S.: worst month life!

That first drag cigarette outside airport long transoceanic flight ....  Aaaahhhh!!!!! Heaven get better this. fresh JFK/LAX air deep long puff!!!! Sadly yes. 500k 800k. what’s really going happen two-income households is, one parents laid crisis, someone supervising kids’ remote learning. parents still job, focus preserving jobs costs. I’m able afford in-home care supervise remote learning, working parents cannot. means millions kids remote learning whenever schedule conflicts parents’ work schedules. parents work outside home, kids going left unattended. hear stories young children dying home mom trying earn living.

I’ve noticed people without kids seem think two-income households, one parent (usually mom) quit job depression put kids’ education first. real world won’t work way. Parents going risk starvation losing home become first-grader’s unpaid teachers aide.

The children middle-class poorer lose full year education. children upper-middle-class basically get education year. CDC also predicted early July we’d 135,000-150,000 total deaths August somewhere around 155,000. It’s pretty bad worst case scenario isn’t bad enough. obstructed views though. empty year resume? Also, want us whole year? Videos mass graves dug business usual guess. Yeah remote tribes see tourists po-dunk towns US... curiosity, know Germany special connection South African wine?

Trump reason we're fucked. exactly opposite needed, lied everything, attempted turntesting virus money grab. pushed fake cure stood profit it. assume everyone behave accordingly. That’s subject article however people asking black men aren’t complying murdered....errrr, arrested police. average nurse associates's degree probably prone stupid shit. America can’t even lock 4-6 hours, let alone 4-6 weeks. People know look title. 52-7 going school hurting FAR children virus. Cause fake?

Only one way find out! first points dead on. read detailed article once. resentment first figure something out, lack ability figure something own, latch conspiracy theories feeling first.

I mean, cares? medical scientific expertise, respect people learned/studied trust say. Cut three weeks now, 32,898 people died.

“The CDC full shit.” Spain Italy learned areas hit earlier?  Lol marry cool story bro, keep head sand single death tragedy; million deaths statistic.

This guy's policies loudly advocating would actually helped many individuals. reconcile this? think simply pockets big corporations paying lip service social democracy platform last several decades? remember thinking early on, pretty much China Italy starting see huge spikes cases US uniquely ill-equipped deal this. many people opposed government telling do. many corporations much influence politicians going need consumers coming doors order make money. many politicians anti-science take radical measures we'd need prevent disease spreading. honestly even considered (lack of) leadership president would bad/non-existent been. poor kid. feel terrible him. many milestones ahead get share parents. matter.

I'm kinda hoping New Zealand gets another outbreak stop fellating really interesting look back pandemic changed America over. bet huge changes taking place right can’t quite see yet. Yes, extra ordinary- in, far beyond ordinary. people talk America greatest country world can't beat Vietnam new Zealand battling contagious disease. Well, it’s true old never sacrificed young, definition means currently old exploited (sent fight Korea Vietnam, etc) profited elders. “The young” moving category, all.  
 
To continue logical conclusion, today’s young people likely seize onto whatever power accrue time they’re old turn around screw tomorrow’s young make injustices previously experienced themselves. It’s like cycle abuse gets worse generation Sold correct. Employers must post FFCRA applies them: could true. Smokers less likely get covid symptoms, risk do. Perhaps fight lower viral load easily average, higher viral load get hit hard. cannot strike taken report patients unless you’re willing destroy nursing license. Atlanta resident here. Saw report last night. It’s tragic unfortunately becoming common. Gov. Kemp refused take necessary action reduce spread disease protect vulnerable. 

I know brought sub before, mans parents certainly underlying health conditions despite article says. extremely obese. considered underlying issue beyond me.

I feel really bad young man hope gets difficult time. wait til finish Disney vacation send sick kids back school week two. 5 mortgages others Incompetence enemy!

Sadly, incompetent currently winning! Well yeah ideally Covid. teachers. certainly need educators. Non-essential, absolutely need get hair nail salons, gyms movie theaters open. Tinfoil hat time! Trump vaccinated he's constantly pumped drugs that's he's infecting others vaccine took flawed kill him, infecting others normally Well since unemployment run out, they've fucked one. number growing fast. 

All wear masks stay apart possible. That's it. can't even get right. Canada. bad depending province. Im east coast one pt second highest number cases per capita country. moment extremely low cases numbers community transmission months thanks mostly travel restrictions. areas country slow response long term care outbreaks quebec ontario awful. wish masks used widely. Yes did, 2019 low, claimed. average last 10 years 9.1, year seen jump 9.6, due 5,330 excess deaths COVID-19 turning American American. Well played Captain COVID, well played. meantime, saw bloomberg news president alma mater agreed “freeze” $4M compensation package. Morons defeated America. elected current administration, they’re hypocrites comes “freedom”. women choose abortion? answer NO. choose wear mask help people getting sick? answer: NO, Body, right! morons defeated America, actually defeated they’re stupid realize it. Good job morons! again, Americans themselves. foreign attack. Take dn responsibility. There’s big difference pointing risk children returning school, overwhelmed hospitals next 6 months etc 6 million deaths due virus persisting 5-10 years. think people don’t find extreme claims particularly plausible (with good reason) makes less likely listen accurate ones. actual situation bad enough without coming unlikely hypotheticals. Unless adapt like fireworks Boston. Okay, opinion issue **which holiday** moronic behavior occurred? considering CDC admittedly makes conservative estimates statements cases, could bad. Strap in, folks. No. think scientific method used correctly cases. Yeah whole pandemic thing supposed next week right? kid reason. NY surpassed total amount shootings 2019 weekend. 700 shootings we’ve got 5 long months go another potential shutdown looming evictions. 

Apparently COVID deaths creeping back NY, unsure that’s folks passing home long hospital stays. 

It’s also super hot. suspect folks getting outside first time heat getting them. saw 3 ambulances pick ups bike ride thru Prospect Park. Thanks laugh unimaginable child going breaks heart. prayers go family know they're watching you. news spreads death, relatives descend house and, despite risks, pandemic hasn’t altered way mourn. 

reminds Ebola crisis years back... lots death rites people getting really close together touching deceased. Shouldn’t hard 2017-2018-2019 fine all.
Americans themselves. act terror, Americans ignorant selfish. Wear damn mask, wash hands, quit holding mass events, learn social distance like rest damn world. way terrorist attack.

Yeah that’s sort competitive background want applying jobs recession  Yup, that's I'm curious about. Though 90%+ keeping on. Wonder certain percentage mask wearers sufficient keep spreading (though would worrying, many people would think OK wear one someone else does), got lucky ones wear one HAPPENED infected. Although ""many"" misleading referring wearing masks/properly, overwhelming majority are. even put much fight. Yeah it’s 1% people die. Basically nothing. /s helpful response.

Have considered living woods away others though? May suit better. must admit, feel like we're way outside scope original post. great day, I'm going stop venturing course. hope one people works operations nyc Bc really need job Stalin also really best role model follow one trying keep mortality down... live next highway (literally window view BQE). 

Peak covid sirens pretty much constant.  Masks mandated students either. 

It’s conservative, rural area apparently pandemic isn’t happening. /s think trying say - bars selling to-go drinks, police enforcing open container laws NYC looks like bought drink bar. said 2019, 2018. Thats called Christianity. cause tragedy falls squarely Trump's rounded shoulders. NYC pretty much open
Plenty areas go drink. good restaurants bars (that sell grocery items) set shop outside.
Trains running. Workers work home come office.
Beaches open many capacity.

The difference is, responsible population be. wear mask? self isolate? Etc

Ya something terrible like selling single ciggertte something. OSHA visit, lack required poster would least concerns.

You draw line somewhere. moment selling corporate interests sadly requirement candidate reach nationwide, be. ideal response country would entailed locking borders back January became crystal clear deadly global pandemic unfolding.  yet, there’s entire community people behind sport would say statement true they’re mourning need mental health. co-worker Crohn's disease cares elderly parents. recently bragged going bars restaurants (we live South area cases rising quickly). texted Savannah, GA asking restaurant recommendations one recent weekend.

Except, are. Thats problem pointing reason hear complaints often Obama cause chaos every single day. matter much fox wanted believe it, create constitutional crisis every waking moment president now.

I dont know Fox wants anyone believe watch it, Obamas created crysies first 4 years thna Trump did. isnt say like Trump, people act like hes brought armagedon country. didnt. live present. Care what's happening today.

Americans furious bad thing Americans stupid stupid + furious gets nowhere. look passes ""the left"" country anything productive. *decades.* ""fury"" amounts shouting ""vote out"" completely corrupted, totally broken ""representative"" republic. joke.

True, probably helps retention. mean would dare quit job now. anyone family, self insuring would likely double monthly expenses guess Trump cares US citizens amount cares people 5th Avenue.

Remember Obama actually gave damn. I'm shocked well liked yet stupid enough sign waiver go Rally. So, facts? presumably, PRO-drunk driving? 


Are member ""the party life""? depressing parts life always centered around losing family friends. many people know die, know able function. friend mines already lost uncle. Already seen family person long :-/ You: ""Voting Iraq War idiotic"".

Seriously, pull head fucking asshole, stop licking boot got big embossed it. Agreed, reason opted full remote upcoming school semester (we given option blended full remote school) also take account less severe infections? in, 50% people vaccine still get COVID (and 50% won’t all) (lower unvaccinated people) number get mild symptoms?

If it’s 50% don’t get all, hospitalization death rates drop, say, half well it’s pretty solid effect. ""out possibility."" said, always possible could significant surge occurs week. that's would take. Going 18% week-over-week increases 40% week-over-week increases one week, without increase known cases (positives either steadily barely decreasing positive rate steady weeks) hospitalizations (though, granted, data messy past couple weeks), would quite leap.

Possible? Sure. Statistically likely, based upon trends we're seeing? No. dramatic ""OMG PEOPLE DIE!"" fear way. recently quit serving job. live semi-communal housing.

Dr. Birx said yesterday U.S entering new phase virus widespread. anyone explain data basing on, new phase still first phase? confusing phase wave? America defeated all.

Yeah. America keeps winning. matter guys deemed [most prepared health last year seemingly take advantage preparation all.

You, average American, mind. We'll hear less white house filters information. Give us food stamps cable tv. bottle missile definition real world throwing bottle someone someone shooting gun. One hurts one doesn't.

??? Absolutely. Softer, selfish, expecting treated like god retail food workers. agree. worry everyday wide ranging impacts country. extremely large proportion people completely asymptomatic.

%50-%60, that's extremely large. people end hospital COVID, die COVID. Kinda like AIDS kill directly, weakens immune system. COVID works similar ways exacerbates pre-existing conditions. People die diseases co-morbidity exacerbate COVID co-morbidity; thus would die COVID. extraordinarily retarded say someone dies pneumonia COVID died otherwise - clearly already vulnerable disease kills vulnerable people.

Other countries problem know why? stupid ass argument used fudge numbers attempt hide COVID deaths. Hell countries even counting suspected COVID cases COVID deaths, we're that. It’s definitely possible China hid thousands deaths beginning outbreak, though sounds control now. remember article urns?   People willingly went debt chose live beyond means. government gets swoop save day using taxpayer money. Yeah, current administration declared media enemy people seeing anything video likely going bring “conspiracy” distrust. Couldn’t argue skewed make things look worse? dont send kids school? Riots tend take 10 years recover economically. shown over.

This political idea. It’s economic reality. good chunk US thinks hoax AZ/Oxford one heartbeat. Preliminary data looks good three daughters lead scientist took it. That's enough me. 

I really dislike current state affairs. People start get nervous. Germany relatively good response appear losing patience within society. people scrutinise wearing mask.

It's really confusing. ~17k people demonstration Berlin lot right-wing/left-wing, antifa, greens, pride people etc. 

REALLY confusing. Oh man can’t wait us make first vaccine america haters shit cry uncontrollably schools starting back country. biggie. That....that's opposite doing.

Indian Independence Movement gained huge boost it, colonial leaders basically left India burn revolutionaries seen actively *doing* things help. flipside, South Africa fears elites ""hygiene"" black laborers would contribute establishment Apartheid laws.

Louisiana been... good, sure that's right word- creative entrepreneurial ultimately bad...Louisiana exceeded bending outright ignoring guidelines. I'm transplant really strange see majority friends states seemingly taking COVID seriously: wearing masks, staying home unless necessary, even saying 'miss' certain places/things without attacking guidelines, demanding open and/or making loop hole. Friends way lax. Lots pictures vacations, large diners out, group shopping trips browse, maskless, house parties, calling hoax panic hoax, encouraging others buck guidelines, getting fussy allow come hang out, even ending friendships wearing mask. point motivation staying home asshole people even virus. alarming quickly hostile situations arising. heated people get someone wearing mask asked wear mask. general people seem closer snapping believe fueling businesses. little public temper tantrum way dealing emotions regarding chaos world rite now. start can't stop fear wrong- apparently worst thing be.

Is anything place kids like find immediate family dying? understand math God bless kid. Hes got long hard road ahead doesnt veer it, doubt it'll turn one strongest men ever lived I'm comparing flu though, are. understand worse flu elderly. 

I'm saying covid looked proportion causes. elderly deaths rarely single cause, lots contributing factors. needs considered claiming deaths. 

For example: 100 year old, ill grandpa gets it, he's likely die. simply got covid. He's likely die 100 year olds sickly likely die ANYTHING adds load already overworked immune systems.  Blaming covid *entirely* death would disengenuous *best* even work way Japan.... American whole life.

Guessing Florida blaming underlying reason cause death. We’d probably need see overall mortality rate Florida vs previous years get idea. learn lesson that's super obvious. well past learning time. Excess death compared average death rate certain data use compare different countries. amazing excess deaths spiking levels unprecedented since WW2 everywhere virus lot people dying testing positive, magically they're spiking anywhere that's containing it. Like 800 dying every day NYC completely unrelated reasons exactly weeks infected place world time 200 die day since 9/11. amazing coincidence.

Or maybe live outside US? US bad shape right expected get lot worse. need fix memory somehow, phrase. 

For me, reading quickly antibody immunity wanes SARS-CoV 1+2... Username checks virus could spread floating air, masks help much. virus easily pass mask.

 Losing one parent bad enough, quickly 
Hang there, hardly imagine going said United States, country badly. group people stereotype? fishing reason try offended this? objective fact, United States handling pandemic terribly. sort behavior, fairly common, part why. said ""perhaps"" US ""might"" countries.

If going complain someone's post, try reading beyond first word.

 anything, I'm nicer US. American excess deaths 30% higher official covid deaths. means covid deaths probably undercounted degree, deaths vary year year.

Some countries disparity excess official covid deaths literally ten times bigger. cases, there's little room doubt covid cases undercounted absolutely *massive* amount*.* government already buys concept. never comes needs. Don’t give up, you’ll kill rest us you.
And entire country suffer blow economy completely collapse. give up. sympathize living Portugal sees Competent far away. think lot ""it works"" moving goal post. Trump pushed something would clear COVID maybe even prevent it. get prescription take good go. 

My wife encountered patients recovered COVID HCQ part treatment. Usually steroids plus HCQ helping out. 

So people pointing fact used treatment cure. people seeing demanding treatment. see studies showing used effective proof science wrong. tool, probably pretty minor one, getting people better. It’s normalized here. Wild West never really ended. Lol anti mask step sister named Sharon, that's real $$$ sometimes couple adopt many possible tax refund. unheard find adopted children living cages boonies.

Unsure downvotes? condone child  I'm Iowan thinks Reynolds sucks... worst though? terms loss human life, right middle deaths per 100k. lot states done worse. Right? It’s like ‘oh shit I’d watching network didn’t leave 75” tv partial payment outstanding rent became homeless, good know’ like 2005 study chloroquine (not chemical hydroxychloroquine) used monkeys (not humans) even whole monkeys (cells monkey petri dish) even virus (sars-cov) definitely shown cure monkey sick virus. defend conservatives (cause lot dumb, I'm leftist), see extent sides. anti vax hippie types (which sides political aisle) also refusing wear masks tend believe lot conspiracy stuff.  Federal Res print money. Congress absolutely allocate it. Truly effective lockdown requires temporary sacrifice personal freedom

FTFY think US first began encouraging mask use, may figured “Perfect enemy good” — we’re better bandana tied nose like outlaw bare-faced ... course, given there’s zero chance Government would cover costs ensure supply 😣 Compare Oregon Florida, Portland protests every night 60 days, don’t like Florida, use Colorado Nevada Bezos could hoped better outcome course is.

Completely different scenerious can’t really compared.  country handle release -pre trial? disease terrible polio. vaccine, even 50% effective, would greatly reduce spread, quite quickly highly vaccinated population. people risk already quite low long-term ill-effects, reducing spread would get us lot closer normal. misdemeanor? That's BS.

These need felonies. Almost everyone commenting missing point.

Airborn mean ""transmitted breathing,"" referring small particles, aerosols, suspended air. aerosols get air, cloth mask *will almost completely ineffective stopping them*.

There argument masks still helpful stopping respiratory droplets become small enough aerosolize, certainly stop them.

All say virus airborn enough, masks work.

As aside, since masks work, known spread airborn.  Hence Fauci saying ""a degree of"" Apparently difference they're actually coming full term. Yea little truth little time   Something tells already criminal record.

I hear sound Trump openly admitting even pretend talk Putin findings American intelligence agencies Russian government placed bounty American soldiers. welcome continue sick bending medical echo chamber, which/who usually 40 years behind science. GM one mostly myth. complete myth, since corporate buyouts forced thousand German workers GM, including many Nazis.

GM survived economic collapse 1929 using Great Depression (which actually economic crisis, worse economic depression) kill buy rival car companies. bought German car companies, Weimar Republic began prompt build new factories would (unknown GM) strategic locations war could sequestered repurposed republic's military war started. plan continued Nazis took power became less effective Hitler bit loudmouth, also happy German car companies German, hence creation Volkswagen 1937.

You correct Eastern Front ultimate deciding factor defeat Germany. forget US resources power quickly easily defeat Germany 1943 1944, strategic watch Soviets Germans fight other. (Before WWII US expected war British Empire Japan, Japan Germany like played reality, US warplans overkill)

The Eastern Front ignored wars though. one gives Russians credit defeating Napoleon's empire. skip British defeating Napoleon escaped jail (and ignore Prussian army arriving middle battle). Historians never focus Central Powers winning Eastern Front WWI massive demoralization French British soldiers felt realized Germans Austrians would soon double numbers.

Also interesting use standard 2atm, 90 minute treatment well seems worked, without complications. wonder doctors puncture ear drums advance. league players given lot try make season happen crazy circumstances

This example sunk cost fallacy. Unrecoverable money effort put NFL season mean need season given current circumstances.

When started preparing, number daily new cases decreasing substantial. nearly two month explosion new cases likely continue see tens thousands daily new cases least next month two.

We also seen number outbreaks MLB infected dozens players may cause already short season cut even shorter. fact NFL much larger rosters full contact support compared MLB, make even concerning.

There also increasing concerns persistent symptoms COVID, even mild cases. concern young athlete. disease could potentially end entire career develop heart lung conditions result COVID-19.

The way could potentially work teams put bubble similar NHL. teams players seem willing this, honestly see safe way season go forward. paranoia... fever due covid ... ... Yes, 8 billion dying every day Debt already negative now. U.S survived economy outgrew egregious amount debt pumping every year; even debt projected outpace economy future. contracting economy + unholy amount deficit spending; we're better invest actual people grow economy along taxing rich much expect see crime everywhere along sweet mood despair. Countries like China/Russia already realizing starting buy GOLD now. countries going sit back let investments/debt become devalued likely getting back either. world look stable currency. guess folks knew government capable solving problems money usually give Wall Street, would really pose problem desire loot us give Wall Street.  better chance actually getting Covid.

Better hope, since guys don’t include health insurance benefits Think dumb average person is, remember half population dumber that.

I think george carlin quote, feels appropriate. Could left ""Covid-19"" headline Cancel check then. scrabble team?

Speaking person privilege myself, comments seem incredibly privileged. disagree.


I think led homeless shelter story ""outside box"" maybe makes better journalism. episode, evidence vitamin playing major role found British doctor compelling me. otherwise healthy physicians dying disproportionately covid. impoverished members society. note many cases athletics, fraternities, summer students, campus while.

Your worry entirely valid, however - population college towns still go 10x month USA =! USD

One global superpower, currency. 

Same different different.  OK, even Bolsonaro going change opinion; staff I'd start wearing mask. get that's data using analysis.  I'm wondering friend whether expertise, career, accreditation, education line offering professional opinion, layman's take?

If plane, question pilot, would rando insisted could fly plane, get me? exceptional article. hospitalization deaths cases reported cdc. Yea, 9 11 average 10. 11 10. hey, let's open schools allow kids drink open water fountains passing along germs one another parents home... makes sense. stupid suggestion ""abstinence only"" education, probably effective. really can't get Putin's dick mouth he? Good point talking smaller businesses . I’m brainstorming ideas point.  situation NY dire. suggestions?

As far larger businesses go potential large profits worker owned buses could work real. thought accidently sorted feed weirdly, seeing old post. Nope, really dumb people carrying on. gone on, agree players play they're overreacting?

Of course not. NCAA garbage organization, care players one way another, put TV contracts player safety possible, players stand themselves. this, also, games resume, things like getting paid contributions, able likenesses, etc.

I think bad-behavior ""gas-lighting"".  term specific definition used decades particular context, last year two, influential blogger something thought word sounded cool decided everything like ""gas-lighting"" now.  hear term day, every day, every context, kind all-purpose insult.  think think sounds cool, harder easily respond really mean anything anymore. Like start saying, ""damn, guy fear foxing me!"" insult kind stands can't opposed nobody knows means. Yeah, China 1300 death known March, death homes died results came back.

That's Worldometer there's 1300 jump April 17, tallied excess death reported official death.

I'm guessing US never same. I’m curious. get tested? go whenever want see.  I'm imagining bunch kids surrounding politician coughing them. I’m removed posting facts happen political? Cool. important information. Masks really designed prevent catching disease much preventing spreading disease. added benefit helping TINY bit, primary purpose keep germs yourself, since might a-symptomatic carrier. 

It's probably ideal, someone one things, might mock little, I'm going get irritated it, like nose-showers maskless. would go out, recently, middle aged people pretty much ones I'd see masks. couple people 30s, one younger elderly people. I'm also part covid study show survey responses people give broken age group. People age group, 18-35, less likely average American wear masks study. 

There's way none young people democrats. yelling freedoms, notice it. quietly unsafe. There’s depression / mental illnesses people “born with” — kinds run families.

AFAIK, Bipolar Disorder Schizophrenia two psychiatric disorder proven genetic link. Depression Anxiety ""run families"", lot strong evidence linking genetic inheritable state. daily new cases slowly going back past month campuses essentially empty. That's soul-crushing. much distancing? food shared? What's bathroom situation? don’t know you, listen *actual* experts stay consistent. makes part problem. That's ""free range kids"" movement. Kids mostly fine without supervision, rare instances harm probably outweighed psychological issues caused constant monitoring.

But *education* happen, probably need adult room. agree wholeheartedly. episode deeply irresponsible. I've certain idea much asymptomatic disease amongst chronically homeless Boston, but, say, buried lede negates whole theory.

I would add, speculatively, chronically homeless live Pine Street Inn physiologically even age/morbidity matched controls. Living street staying Pine Street *selects* hardier cohort.\*\*

\*\*You see folks survive hardship living street dead. (Homelessness morbid often fatal condition.) ones choose live Pine Street (which caters rough crowd) tough enough defend and/or banned gentler shelters. Many homeless folks Boston choose stay street rather run risk Pine Street. mean judgmentally. Pine Street huge amount good, need pretty tough dude hack there. like leave comments unanswered. Don’t neighborhoods still fund public schools property tax regardless kids enroll? Good them!! 

Are students next? hear students? 

**Kids? there?!** Seems like blame shifting recent deaths? 

Idk hate sound accusatory but.. Onus verify claim. Vietnam handled things remarkably well, nation seems know strain. Give words, since early June, Coronavirus causing less 10 percent deaths would expected.

This yet accurate statement make. link says may take 8 weeks report deaths, data recent early June considered incomplete time. I've Strugis couple times. outside, like bike shows. majority interaction bars, restaurants, hotels, concert venues, etc. 

Not lot people want spend day outside. South Dakota August unbearably hot covered leather. People find air conditioned buildings real fast. Ok, yet another story facemasks (yawn).

My question F guys SHIRT??? LOL would find long haired brunette compare another long haired brunette different crisis “prove” crisis actors. person obviously isn’t gonna listen argument, read supporting figures, links sources. regurgitated talking point probably busy perpetuating racist narrative conspiracy theory now. think I'm advocating masks can't read. wear one every day work. Oh! Oh yeah, he’ll fine... people susceptible bad symptoms ones get *first*, along people medical contact intensive fields people get vaccine? like teacher? That’s question asked several comments ago extra teachers would come from.

I already anticipate next reply saying “not teachers, supervisors” think *kinda* works older (high school) students definitely elementary. Elementary school kids aren’t going sit go courses’ syllabus self-study (lol, younger end spectrum can’t even read all). Swedish citizens suffer least second order effects, undebatable. Yay English people again. proud. Sigh. infections deaths anyone else world. Care wager guess why?

Because adjusting population size? wow thats super sad :/ ""I think I'm much humble would understand.""

- #45 Nobody telling athletes virus there. know know risks. student athlete concerned....don't participate. Seems pretty simple me. already happened universities state. lost star RB prospect sitting year out. available evidence pointing no, least within first 6-9 months (which data right now). Based know SARS, MERS coronaviruses, immunity likely granted measured years. 

You'll read articles antibodies vanishing certain amount months, that's true, lot articles leave cells work - cells retain memory virus create needed antibodies get exposed again. 

That said, seems possible isolated cases reinfection, likely isolated. reinfection within months possible meaningful way, we'd lot verified data now. fact good thing. 

IF immunity lasts least year, every reason believe does, would enough get us need go vaccine comes out. wonder boomer generation though. What's covered confusion seems stem simply lying.


It's lying continuing lie something everyone knows true fact keep lie going people start question themselves.

Like everyone keeps gaslighting kids immune example. Sorry long worlds advance

Like exists lot valid arguments America argument seems naive. Fermentation fermentation, baby. really isn’t one, given resources federal government has, I’m sure stopped insanity politics moment got heads asses could figure something out. Perhaps laptop loan program internet costs subsidized can’t afford it. Money pumped hiring program actually hire teachers allow smaller necessary class sizes. There’s million things could done single one are. Sweden never high mask compliance Sweden leadership described masks ""pointless"". Exactly. like said earlier, best new procedures come people working front lines lot bullshit too, VPs sift bullshit ideas would get bogged almost one would saying, ""The restaurant allowed serve dirty food unsafe way authorities back off."" 

You would surprised. bootlicking Holy Business pretty big deal South. Way than, e.g., common sense. There'd plenty morons arms it, complaining Big Bad Government preventing someone jobs. idea gonna get better? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, careless. huddle spaces staff, getting infected expected. need inform works, what's necessary. I'd like things actually open next year randomly deciding want start saving money, giving money people worth them. think continue give people $600, give encouragement go out, find job start working.

I see mean state low cost living. every state different. like act like $1200 huge deal, even pay monthly rent many places. No, that's terrible idea. fuck would want that? I'm making anyone sick. Best annoy anyways right? Wtf must attending dumb green Bay packers game person. Dallas. self respecting highschoo/l-pro subjecting player dumb field roof. think creating false equivalency. Germs come somewhere. get three families friends practicing good safety measures, put kids together learn schoolwork, likelihood covid (or other) breakout minimal. 

When alternatives breadwinner lose job vs sending kids classroom 20-30 kids may may practicing good hygiene, finding ways work together informally seems like good middle ground. 

We talk day ideal solutions, sun goes down, still living ideal world. work we've got, place start one's friends neighbors. Big Government give rat's ass us. Yes, pay taxes, ever made difference? taxpayer status important, would've come better solution ""business usual."" Ah ok. Thx reasonable. usual response I've seen around say better kids dead reply.

a.k.a Apocalyptic Bush Fire Season

(the last one generated enough smoke caused issues New Zealand - *1100 miles* away - parts Australia basically unlivable)  HSBC bigger problems days lol Depends numbers. 

1918 20'000 death population 5.6 mio.
Which leads 375 deaths per 33'000 deaths whole pandemic 1918/1919.

I think point still stands. 
The whole thing way close comfort know whats coming fall. called Spanish flu even though probably originated America! 

This seen absolute malarkey most.

Also, know studies done after, showing orders *didn't lead differences*, right? course know that, right? straight making shit up. evidence organ damage permanent yet. vaccine is, everything goes perfectly, still nearly year away, still know work. does, need enough people take it, might need boosters, need ability make sure everyone takes it. think imagining every single person Reddit monolith fight ... literally putting words people's mouths thoughts people's brains.

I never said 6ft anywhere. never agreed 6ft number think people hanging indoors with/without masks people. think virus airborne. I'm still sure many people getting via airborne transmission, know exposure small amount virions start infection people, airborne transmission technically viable. 

The jury still sorta one. complexity transmission infection virus, know, something gotten completely understood yet. Yes studies, gaining consensus airborne transmission possible. mask wearing social distancing shown effective [large scale studies behavior vs 

:shrug: Idk people would vigorously opposed axes. suppose quite frightening. address Yeah, mean studied mask usage, anything seen later political theater? CCR5 delta 32 mutation

Homozygous right course fucking obvious lol above. Stay safe everyone. say that? Florida decreasing confirmed cases, weeks now. They're 7,000 deaths, still less quarter New Yorks. compare population, Newyork 421k cases, 32k deaths. That's death rate 7.6%. Florida 487k cases, 7k deaths. death rate 1.4%.

But CNN, MSNBC, Oliver, NPR left media told Florida terribly...so guess must true. “Anyone failed wear mask wore improperly charged disturbing peace, warned subsequent violations, fined jailed. city health officer mayor paid fines wearing masks boxing match.” Exactly. keep saying ""They get get it."" someone close say? 1) would make feel better old people ones dying?

2) know virus dangerous even beyond death rate? nerd. Lol imaging writing comment That's really fucked way thinking. Nazis already tried failed.  What's quote? Something something learning history doomed repeat ? rookie numbers That's silly. math easy rate mutation low -- roughly single nucleotide per 2 transmissions.

I seen single reputable source either ""it come bats"" ""it's man made"". That’s said. Oh good, one thing add fact number people infected fucking way ever know terrifying able even close number it. Perhaps difference number hospital beds per 10,000 people? helps read article, explains process would work. Essentially, every member every household submits two samples, pooled two different pools batch tested. batches household's samples tested register positive, either assumed everybody double-positive batches active case, households batch-tested individual households, since considered likely coronavirus spread members household anyway.

Sorry, that's easy-to-follow explanation, please read article, visual aid, too. Yes, first only, agreed  aware masks certified reason? I’ve told, it’s doctors classifying deaths COVID get money, someone died heart attack cancer traffic accident COVID, must COVID killed them. course ask proof, get hearsay allegory. Also, two classifications COVID deaths, people died COVID people died directly COVID. 

What’s strange is, pushing aside incredibly large insult doctors, assume doctors cabal make money fuck ethics, makes sense. government give money hospitals Covid patients Medicare. course falls apart realize additional funds still well cost treatment, doesn’t pay dead people, currently taking bed. 

But numbers? Well, CDC breaks multiple ways; deaths reason, people died infected COVID, people died Pneumonia COVID flu, deaths Pneumonia may may COVID sure Flu, deaths Pneumonia without COVID Flu. never “here sure deaths COVID” makes people read say “those numbers can’t right, large! reality, year year 9% people died we’re supposed to. COVID accounts those. someone doesn’t like tables graphs doesn’t think actually happening, “why something bad happen beautiful day” feeling, columns meaningless, way hide “bad pneumonia year” even shall people wear mask Please come Britain... press pitbulls compared press! This. course they're going downvote it, right. predicted cases would surge Disney opened happen. sub really needs stop trying make predictions. They're pretty bad it. opinion? not.. actual/factual account happened life went...not research echo chambering...a real person sick getting family anyone work sick (because tested family tested, actually I've tested several times work twice negative temp checked idk twice day point) Along knowledge virus spreads, takes bit critical thinking recognize spread inevitably come protests, like packed beaches, concerts, outdoor activity many people close together. think case, would evident? seem understand everyone little happy circle brings entire exposure history live lives outside circle. 😷 problem looking political manner. sides handled completely wrong. instance, shut several small businesses, large businesses tons traffic inside stores, Lowe’s remained completely opened. right, idiotic congressman Stephen Johnson undermining self isolation, openly talking planned Easter Dinner entire family. We’ve also decent sized protests capital right, weeks later large protests BLM left, governor even participating one one point wearing mask. Phase 3, 2, 1 happen schools open up. It’s known fact children 18 younger biggest spreaders disease. Reopening schools fall could potentially one preventable disasters Michigan’s history. needs done schools improve remote learning process benefit children teachers. 

Also curious thoughts education cuts ($700 per student). second time 20 years education funding cut, last time governor Granholm. won’t argue Republicans better, seems past 2 Democrat governors backed Teachers’ unions promised improve education funding, completely done opposite. playing presidential election game saying cuts due lack federal funding, state find money state using fuel tax means subsidize it. Teachers school districts receiving end game. Meanwhile, spending millions tax dollars completely unnecessary covid racial disparities task force, far concluded doctors healthcare workers racist must take racial bias training year..... honestly time would better spent either taking specialized pandemic training healthcare workers work combat disease. one letting African Americans die covid skin color positive covid targeting African Americans intentionally. 

Both sides political spectrum royally screwing us different ways depending state, using virus means play political game leading presidential election. 

Yes Granholm done combat virus great, lifting almost restrictions help protests critical error. Lye, dissolved appropriate quantities, actually really strong base. Yeah remember getting tetanus booster flu shot last year doctor visit.

Sheesh arms hurt felt little shitty WTF, NBC?! say _Victoria, Austraila_ instead cryptic _Australian state_? True. Chuck ocean, pay bill hanging out. mathematically demonstrable virus man-made. simply characteristic something synthetic (based I've read).

However, man-made lab-originated thing. evidence points strongly away lab-originated, far tell *impossible*. Denying least possibility encourages conspiracy theories. consider new evidence lady might have. far, I've seen none. Jesus Christ, people... WHYYY??? ABSURD. link info? device big business opportunity countries opening **responsibly**. say want grandmother die. CCR5 delta 32 mutation

1) get better competition
2) eliminate competition
3) out-smart competition

Are applying everywhere relevant field? know knows somebody else help you? better competition parts continent / country?

For first “real” job, better competition opposite side country. took it, opened career. Sacrifices made, new knowledge connections gained. HSBC one thing confidently say zero cares about. science regarding virus spreads makes virtually guaranteed spread came protests. got headache, fever, chills, heart murmurs, body aches, symptoms COVID I’m fairly young (low 20s). 

Symptoms vaccine seems like dessert compared crap.

Guess won’t need vaccine anymore yeah, one playing threat! people know still living reluctant got hospital, like lot places.  probably millions (?) hundreds thousands least elderly people literally live hospitals nowhere else go.

At least cleanliness level care pretty good, unlike certain countries Even mask nose. /s smart people data. heard things? Yes, ""once-in-a-century"" health crisis, mankind cannot take care itself, ""sufficient"" money, medical facilities, wherewithals; despite them, hands cannot shared ""profit"" comes uncrossable hurdle! least happy hour legal BC. law ten years ago.

Yeah sure, people always lying nobody trusts anymore. people let Trump go promote Hydroxychloroquine, wanted early tests Africans.  can't let us take good news without spoiling good news? Cool yeah I've trouble finding pneumonia/flu data include covid unfortunately. Trial 6 days old. data yet, neither good bad. Thanks clarifying. Would also mind sharing get numbers from?

When look graph look like significant peak mortality spring 2020.

It also seems consensus excess mortality sweden. mind sharing explicitly come different conclusion? reason believe deaths would normally fall throughout year falling mainly within beginning swedish epidemic? Would possible interpretation due (mild) swedish social distancing (compared counries) flu epidemic year abnormally mild flu deaths virtually non existing year?

When look excess looks like swedish numbers lower expected beginning 2020 significantly increased introduction virus.

Compare denmark, excess numbers lower expected beginning 2020 never saw significant increase mortality sweden did.

Even number deaths sweden higher normal (which sure case) seem excess deaths attributed corona, deaths could avoided taking stance similar nordic countries. way happen “overnight”? anecdotal evidence like helpful? need loosen tin foil hat 😂 overly simple explanation, first time sick virus, body uses b killer cells. Well actually always use those. second time b cells remember virus activate cells much quicker. since took A&amp;P, think that's gist it. Facebook Given testing, reporting, tracking.
What go wrong? want healthcare congress gets. pay system get NOTHING! keep social distancing, working home, everything delivered, going walks outdoors.

You're right things. times share space people, wear Honestly attitude towards others convince anyone change behavior, either ignore opposite spite you.

Yeah, there's always going percentage people exact opposite ought to, spite. Fortunately, many countries discovered enforcing heavy fines effective increasing percentage people wearing masks. feel bad teachers contract can’t quit retire. Gdp already shrank full 30%+. enough jobs everyone wants work right now. anyone lazy wanting work. quite simple, enough jobs everyone wants work.

Unemployment already capped rediculously low level near people making employed. Then, sorts qualifications bar large number people getting first place.

Besides, think real issue current aid package people, average Joe get much help, super rich getting they've ever put in. Don’t head r/conservative, guys. They’re sure one rewarded unemployed, “oh, jobs coming back soon”  Let’s see works them. weed out. Strange username promoting points! Nonsense criticism.

Here recent stats:  guy using San Marino - micronation 33k population - reason US bad COVID

They 42 deaths total. essentially flu season year australia. I'd expect surge cases coincides typical flu season: people indoors together due weather, around end year. Fingers crossed Halloween cancelled. basically lets huckster pass along information unchecked. pass pamphlets take time slot public access. need get people retweet share dumb fucking video demon sperm idiots us confirm biases. yes Healthcare system bad tests free mean pay people administering it. Giving feels Someone's idiot seems. I'm sorry families loss Don’t bother responding snowflakes like this. pure fact use word rioters shows intelligence emotional capacity hot dog Trump University already got vaccine. called bleach injection. White House wanted cut leg, Democrats wanted keep leg, would let meet middle cut knee? Prelude stories hear starting next month Centrist liberal come power great hopes change people's life. shit they're mostly every politician.

In Obama's case ""didn't shit"" voters decided stick Republican majority congress would pretty much block every single attempt progress made.  % positive 13% though. Wasn’t 15% last couple weeks? rename coronavirus ""stupid people's disease"" even worst vaccine errors hundreds paralyzed. Covid killing thousand day usa alone. certainly want avoid problems, death rate Covid, alternative vaccine worse. Commuting sucks life force you. People protest match sorts things. people feel strongly convicted can't fault them. thought Mexico paying wall? Preventable tragedy 🙁 saw post earlier saying CDC predicts 11k deaths week month We'll see orphaned kids single parent households probably

...statistically... doctor America denies science. think masks assholes called diapers Swedish mortality statistics historical It’s really much “if” anymore it’s become “how many must die” smoke parsley? Lol ONE state didnt rise numbers 36 others Suuuuure lets believe protesters werent cause. Gotta keep urself politically correct! actually read article? Testing Case counts weren’t part information hospitals moved HHS. Stop spreading blatant false information. says right article pasted, it’s hospital specific data ICU beds, ventilator useage, PPE levels. 


“Since March, hospitals reported daily information availability hospital beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment established data collection network run CDC called National Healthcare Safety Network NHSN, operated years.

As Wednesday, July 15, hospitals instructed HHS shelve system, instead report new site set HHS using private contractor.” Give unbiased source. Furthermore, adding, extending current ones, according article. emissions standards. Furthermore, studies relating pollution severe cases covid actually makes air quality relevant, propping oil industry.

It's also cited response purchasing crude oil, another unnecessary provision bill, proper response provision. 100% believe Republicans letting happen purpose.

That's 814 people total. tested per day. That's ~5,600 tests per week (which continue shrink teams eliminated playoffs). Compared ~700,000 tests done *per day* throughout country, that's pretty fucking insignificant number. 

But wait, there's more! NBA announced today new community testing program providing thousands no-cost COVID-19 PCR tests Orlando, Fla. team markets nationwide.

Direct faux-outrage elsewhere, clearly talking ass. honestly think believe that, think thinking goes like this: virus hoax, they're ""it's hoax"" category, they're ""it really bad"" category. precautions ""overblown"" ""I'm scared."" 

They KNOW masks keep viruses such, guarantee every one would cow surgery doc came street clothes PPE. believe relates Coronavirus, numbers made up, there's reason scared, willing inconvenience slightest something ""99.9% people get recover fine."" Lol, yes, that's right, people problem president United States promoting batshit conspiracy theories oval office telling followers pandemic hoax ""insane."" really concerned retail landscape look like months. retail corridors NYC largely dominated name brands, smaller retailers rely foot traffic bigger guys bring shopping areas right now.

I agree sentiments around (big brand) brick mortar retail drag pre-pandemic, that's boutiques charming mix. Retail needs completely reinvented pandemic recovery- whenever is- interesting streets NYC look like 3-5 years. 2,000 people died testing positive. deaths 85+ age range. virus relatively harmless kill. deaths attributed Covid unrelated Covid. “Check (not) big brain Brad(ster)” Burp got weird definition word ""everyone"" want anything ever hope work backlog new infections tests created storm?  thinking texting driving. first became problem, media. Now? Everyone's texting, noone gives poop Nov. 4 they'll switch blaming Dems able get control US whole shut down. may roll back phases, vast majority (in south, anyway) either care tired restrictions. Personally think it’s phlegm cough up. cough virus get lungs fester long 1-2 days fine. expect people stay put long still contact trace. 

Fairly sure USA well past point able contact trace though. Idiots levels charge. fucked. one kids willing sacrifice greater good? they'll snapped people capital converted rental units, consolidating wealth. Wonderful system we've got here. Meh, hate cars anyway. 11,000 going die every week month, 11,000 would die *this* week. that's see happening. 

Now, they're saying ""An average 11,000 people die week August,"" that's entirely plausible. I'm saying see sort surge happening week. make valid point: Coronavirus Egypt probably hoaxes.

That’s I’m afraid see stats state control- people states come harbor bringing virus them. Isn’t CT Jersey got pummeled first place? This. flagship stores knowingly take losses locations Manhattan. It’s important brand whole established high end brand high end shopping districts city, makes impossible start retail even local historically established retail afford area. personally don’t think right wrong, based market demands. comment explanation rates, judgement. seem deranged. Get help. Seems like title would much better much accurate read “This woman stays late cataloging Health Care worker COVID deaths” sell air-bags? Test results deaths still sent CDC. Hospitalisation data not.

I thought supposed better administration actually stick facts? Link please? FL teacher here. Local testing sites completely shut down. testing done doctor. Ron Deathsentence actual worst. want people take seriously instead spouting gibberish maybe rational. Maybe grow up. all. see someone already explained though. 

Trust simple basis, tourist built economy NEEDS people come visit, going best paint Rosey picture possible. That’s simple human nature. way without really “lying”. data suppression US making angry AF. would think total number deaths would important point. Covid fraction causes death Georgia.  fear outrage? Maybe quarter mil 'gofundme'. I'm aware of. Businesses tend carry insurance seen either retailers insurers reporting lot losses.

Things like broken window terribly expensive replace. Inventory add up, really retailers carry ton inventory idle due pandemic. much damage think video? 0.001% value?

Edit: also, commercial property values? Outside real estate investors cares? Means active cases population upstream sampling point.

This, IMHO, easiest effective way identify virus trends are.  Zero mention Italy strain new one. assume Italy strain hear otherwise. quite welcome got news weekend assisted living facility mom living 2 residents test positive taken hospital. Turns played bingo several times last 2 weeks.

My mom 80's lived full life, worried afraid.

Thank making smart l, healthy responsible life choices. Protests large gatherings. didn’t contribute spread COVID-19 multitude reasons proven several studies mentioned article others.

Don’t get mad me. Get mad science fitting narrative, guess.  Considering teens spread most, looking middle school disaster middle schoolers full defiance mode, time  test results published may “hurricane tests” (that is, tests last 4 days), suppressed number tests certified published last days result hurricane. Either labs running reduced capacity office puts numbers running reduced capacity both. Buy local. Thank farmers. Oh opinion needs personal?

Edit: someone expresses disagreeable political opinion, tries get away something unethical.

You understand totally applicable situation? They're trying convince people take action dangerous lying (aka gaslighting situation) telling dangerous.  thing city living really spend time home (under normal conditions). place sleep, shower, get dressed. spend time restaurants, bars, clubs, museums, theaters, stadiums, office, traveling. experience anyway. understand maskless people gathering indoors close proximity lead surge cases? vs mask wearing people outside? Trumps sons school staying closed though! would interesting see behind decison taken official source. seems likely connected this:

[There Swedish tourists Finland - Turku one wonders lot Swedish city center Turku America’s unwillingness learn countries issue. essentially given game plan China, Taiwan, SK, Italy(later on) others decided ignore all. 

In countries, especially Asia, masks recommended enforced beginning think good idea til day debate effectiveness them. 

Not mention, cooperation Wuhan doctors, Jack put whole damn COVID prevention handbook dealing shit back March believe seemed ignored. America’s arrogance unwillingness temporarily sacrifice people problem, pandemic not. know could blame stupidity company supposed false sense security they're supposed bring.

The information there.  Thats problem, trump would love actual nation could attack. not. can't wartime president actuality there's incentive According article, appears not. seems like isolated strain small European countries dealing according genome testing. mean first time, plenty people still unironically believe russia behind everything bad world working outside new World Trade Center downtown mid-April height pandemic NYC world. full tyvek suit giant respirator looked like CDC... 3 tourist ladies come wearing bandanas face asking directions WTC memorial. believe it.

Holy shit, point cant even make bad jokes us covid anymore. It´s like usa writing manual spread disease even real time. think likely we'll hear schools closing quickly due teachers getting sick enough replacements available (or willing) fill in. They’re going pull bootstraps figure out.

I’m trying dick. sounds crass insensitive, solution. Maybe financial aid scrounged somewhere.

But ultimately, chose baby, chose raise kid—and responsible parents save money babysitters case something like happens. child responsibility. child go summer school out? Summer break?

We’re asking parents outfit children gold diamonds here. figure adult supervision fall semester (or longer needed). Hmm can't think examples governments leaders railed ""lying press"". Right? daughter's fault dad decided self-destruct -- but.. maybe said something *to him* instead telling rest us now?

I mean, pop-pops _still_ going hydroxychloroquine instead admitting maybe rainbows unicorns there. No. crime. wake call February. Understatement year.  get chose DJT second candidate row dems voted Iraq War refuse see fucking issue here.

You willfully choosing dumb shit, anti-mask simpletons.

Grow fuck up, pull head asshole. 2nd Amendment exactly situation government allowing thousands people die?

And causing global turmoil foreign policy since 40's pretend care now. that’s true aren’t panicked unknown illness that’s spiking death rate normal then? true state. guess I’ll take word it. [Coronavirus Vaccine method review findings trial date. Moderna Phase II trial demonstrated vaccine produced antibodies cell immune cells virus. Thanks letting know! fuck....?? one. looking system relied things remaining versus adaptable new situations. going part collapse current state affairs, possibly nation. OR... lot dead people people pushing past it. I'm sure referring to. Different thread scientific standpoint, ‘second wave’ can’t happen there’s sustained downward trend new cases. look graph daily new cases, you’d need see 3-4 weeks steady decline second wave could start. Flat, steady rates, plateaus wouldn’t really qualify. 

For instance, Italy peaked end March, rapidly declined low steady rates. If, god forbid, rate started climbing again, would qualify second wave. 

On hand, US reached plateau slight decline, around middle June, started escalating quickly. Since sustained decline, US still first wave. can’t believe American people desperate money willing settle second round measly $1200. That’s barely rent live people hurting first round checks. 3 months ago?!? yes, American need money, extended unemployment benefits snap benefits, health care!, rent/ mortgage assistance! 

And bet ass COUNTRY money give corporations better start digging deep giving money back people. 

Correct I’m wrong, it’s money?! paid MONEY LITERALLY SLAVING away minimal pay (at times) job ( 2 3) pandemic many people simply cannot find work, government can’t find money GIVE BACK PEOPLE?! 

I mean fuck government think people going money besides spend it?!? Put RIGHT back economy ultimately back government pockets corporations. get money give us RIGHT BACK. it’s like PEOPLE start hoarding money... lol mean cold imagine that... hey maybe THATS they’re worried about. k eep g oing. ou r  f irst p lace omeone w ill ay:""we id  g ood j ob.  f irst n ow. id b eautiful preading. id  g ood j ob."" find article, is: One stations writing new article every time new case school. session 2 days far.

Good luck job hunt. come amusement. sub cesspool hypochondriacs engaging doomsday fear-mongering.

Devoss inhuman. entire family scum earth. case France assume difference covid death excess deaths causes deaths drastically diminished? Road work accidents, drunk driving, stuff like probably US military announced recruit anyone who'd caught COVID. 

(They pull back say recruitment would subject medical tests, shocker announced.) strain already?

Article specifically mentions ""compared strain January"" think means happening different happening April May virus prevalent everywhere regional then. NYC epicenter COVID 19 US, although seems like Florida, Texas, states taken hot spot status away. 

There's tourism days (or little) well money fleeing NYC suburbs smaller places. suppose fear second wave.

These flagship stores always getting name rather anything else. can’t prioritize both?

Create incentives first time homeowners don’t need 20% payment. 

Allow American citizens purchase many properties damn well please.

Limit foreign investment properties, allow commercial purchases international corporations, deny private residential home sales foreign individuals don’t green card favor prioritizing Americans legal residents. 

See, wasn’t difficult, needed little bit nuance. mean covid sewage? r/noshitsherlock That’s exactly meant. Shit true. probably 50 years left get want spend world international tourism immigration extinct dodo.  Smart, since cruise ships never coronavirus problem Yeah people actually believe China, source outbreak, bottom 10 countries least infected per capita. 

Idiots.  I'm sorry exercising first amendment right protest fundamentally different saying fuck going Disney World. people protesting lockdowns, imo, real dumb still look better people crowding Disney right now. survey, figure runs half workers making $50,000 (according Nielsen data) 74% employees (per recent reports American Payroll Association National Endowment Financial Education.) almost three 10 adults emergency savings all, according Bankrate’s latest Financial Security Index.

You blame reason want. Bottom line large amount population lives paycheck paycheck. American society always one crisis away popping. evidence need social safety nets.

Also, gov't would've focused actual problem (COVID), tried rhetoric way health crisis worst would behind us, people would feel safer optimistic returning pre-pandemic behavior. Instead throwing money problem without fixing problem. That's insanity. Pay pay later. America keeps choosing later. lot testing centers closed hurricane Isaias weekend AT&amp;T dropped channels informing Pandemic progress criticizing Trump, notably CNN. Suddenly requites ""subscription"". information suppression? cannot find channels talking pandemic like CNN uverse. happened Tuesday last week.

It seems like seroprevalence around 20% enough substantially lower transmission, initially thought somewhere around 50-70%. high cases per 100k Lisbon area, spooked lot people guess.

Of course disaster tourism industry, tourism way highly developed wealthy society. Alright, think functionally mentally ill religious.

 heavy implications there.

Since want “help” someone ought autonomy discussion, qualifies religiosity mental illness view? mum lost parents seperate incidents year apart late teens. Purely anecdotal course, fucking sucks still mess many dates year/anniversaries. 33 years on. southern population going get decimated due high prevalence obesity there. Americans general fat place especially South. 2020 like never-ending "" Well least can't get worse! \*cue thunderstorm\*"" don’t see anything lethal. One million cases every thirteen days current metrics. Three million new cases August 29 alone. That's looking unless something changes drastically. schools starting, especially South, complicates lot things. read Tennessee's governor ordered schools give infection/death numbers public!  parent, I'd everything possible home school. truth might (in much complicated sense... There's sliver evidence may achieve semblence herd immunity populations around 20% infected), that's basing policy decisions on.

Same. ""Hold handle vodka. fucking drink James can't afford share anymore."" 

I recently listened current episode Radiolab podcast. started visiting homeless shelters see they're handling virus.

The consensus seemed unaffected. Nobody sick cities across nation. naturally expected vulnerable population ravaged.

Then testing became readily available, shocked learn many 40% homeless tested positive, yet never got sick.

They compared stories 1918 pandemic, basically lack options, put sick people outdoors health, worked. (If aware, body creates Vitamin D, exposed sunlight)

They went explain that, consistently, sickest covid cases vitamin deficiencies. Vitamin stop catching virus (and possibly passing others), might well protect worst consequences.

They recommended 15 minutes daylight time 10 2 PM, peak UV hours.

Go outdoors.

If science support this, still good idea general wellbeing. People need wisen want survive pandemic. chose utilize cerebral cortex hundreds thousands evolution provided us stand chance survival, don’t gambling odds immune system health care industry keep alive. 

Here’s thing though: It’s apparent long term health impacts disease even “survive” basically means may never truly *recover*. Wait big hurricane strikes coast go-to solution ""ship everyone schools gyms week"" remotely option... anyway. 

For two weeks hear everything fine, ""See, fake numbers."" month later though.... oof. Shit's gonna bad. I've come response ""IT'S CHINA'S FAULT""

No matter came from, deal mess suffering it. started China, deal issue US. way know things getting better hospitalizations finally trending down. case number hella unreliable. even talking deaths either.

The fact better change fact data reporting unusable. Well fair, US run corporations people.

That's one big reason social net nearly inexistent. Hate submissive viruses Everyone breathes dies eventually. Stop breathing. No, not. Sweden 5700 deaths state utterly failed protecting elderly. think swedish model working (seemingly) right due many people dying.

Look way radiation exposure cancer. entirely possible single X-ray give cancer. also possible hundreds upon hundreds X-rays give cancer. generally, benefits X-rays course life *far* outweigh risks one really worries.

Whether benefits 6.01 ft separation 14.99 minutes outweigh risks individual society decide. CDC probably found risk acceptably low number sake contact tracing. think study referring showed 99% people displayed symptoms CTE found evidence it. Still damning, important distinction Holy shit. brain dead? UK=/=US even U.K. isn’t “over reporting” 

Your source may...things changed since then. zero critical thinking it’s astonishing. ^ recent one clearly missed said way deaths counted got looked made significant impact data. also undercounting deaths.
 could tested positive February, symptoms, hit bus July you’d recorded Covid death.”

When Guardian put source PHE, said scenario would “technically” counted coronavirus death, **“though numbers situation would apply likely small”**. PHE says calculates deaths way because, circumstances, cannot dismiss possibility Covid-19 could played role mean PHE’s figures much higher actual virus death rate? quite**

Oh god there’s slight inaccuracy death count entire country? Shocker! **undercounting** early April would know even bothered read source. Sir David Spiegelhalter, chair Winton Centre Risk Evidence Communication University Cambridge, said: “**There would big impact recently, time people tested positive recover die something Loke said that, **at present, overall death toll unlikely affected since early outbreak PHE approach underestimated deaths Covid-19 due lack testing**. **“The true Covid death toll probably close PHE ONS reporting, time pattern PHE wrong**, said.

And appears general agreement that, time goes on, PHE approach could become problematic. Indeed, Dr Susan Hopkins, PHE’s incident director, quoted tweet Friday saying: “Now right time review deaths calculated”.

Which entire point date article, they’re going changing way it’s calculated future numbers accurate. isn’t “half covid deaths faked!” gotcha point you’re making. **I math it’s maximum 5% deaths weren’t listed main cause.**

And even read article? It’s even says deaths miscounted WAY obvious undercount deaths top Small fraction “over reported cases” due lack testing deaths Department Health Social Care releases daily updates briefings GOV.UK **the numbers deaths UK, reported day before, among cases positive test coronavirus** 

(We’ve addressed old source may getting broader definition **used 29 April 2020**

When U.K. figures England included deaths hospitals care homes community settings**. 

They undercounting deaths. READ. means deaths reported England consistent reported rest UK. **The Department Health Social Care data reports deaths people Covid-19 necessarily due Covid-19**.... , **and include deaths people Covid-19 suspected laboratory test done negative. negative tests may ‘false negatives’** if, example, virus present small amounts, specimen throat nose wasn’t taken correctly, tests always accurate.

Official PHE twitter: 

Of 40,528 #COVID19 deaths reported 15th July:

• Around 90% deaths occurred within 28 days positive test

• **Of died 28 days**, COVID-19 **stated main cause death death registration form 47%**


[2/2] 

• **Counting died within 28 days positive #COVID19 test** would include 35,664 deaths, **and exclude 4,149 deaths people laboratory confirmed infection**


Here’s math: 

40,528 total deaths 
~90% within 28 days (35,664)
~10% 28 days (4,149)

Actual percentages:
88% within 28 days 
12% 28 days

Of 4,149 28 days, **47% still listed deaths mainly contributed covid. ** 

47% 4,149 = 1,950

Leaving remaining 53% = 2,199 deaths

That’s margin error. Let’s pretend 2199 people didn’t die covid. That’s 2200 deaths 40,528...

**5.43% deaths covid. 

And that’s assuming people would died within time frame even without covid**. welcome! highly recommend them, previous masks little uncomfortable hard breath through. give great coverage feel like wearing [nothing I'm sorry happened fight hard taken seriously.

But I'm glad received diagnosis! Literally Karen hundred former XFL AAF players would happy appear NFL games. CFL players would likely know better. negate though? Homeless people cannot expected healthy immune systems first place. filed u/shitamericanssay.

Took 2 minutes find thread. 

A cloth mask may directly protect wearer effectively, MUCH less likely infect others spread disease, actually protecting less people infected means less people potentially infect later.

Yes, largely blame fact can't get control. Getting control requires cooperation, nation, it, largely leadership split science actually encouraging things make hard make progress. 

You know, national leadership wasted months taking stance going blow big deal, followers took stance. refused wear mask made excuses scientifically valid wear mask, followers took stance on.

The guy encouraged people protest stay-at-home orders states them.

Who acknowledges dangerous hold political convention demands children teachers staff return schools immediately?

The guy still spreading misinformation disease contain it, today attacking another doctor saying serious issue, week promoting doctor thought demons semen caused diseases said something contradictory doctor like actually correct?

Yeah, think blame CDC.

EDIT: guy spreading LOT misinformation appears political slant subreddit. He's still comparing covid flu, lying covid transmission among children push school reopenings urging people essentially ignore virus go live lives. Lmao right actually trying keep guys out. evidenced closed borders think life lost covid worth 5 times life lost heart disease? Ooo didn’t know comment attracted rolly trollys. Always pleasure see troll pop up.

Stay cheap hostels, use money shopping. bring masklessholes family, it’s “fake news” “they probably died something else”. point bubble burst, let reality. numbers flatlined like two days everyone assumed good enough. 10% district opted 100% virtual learning, even commit single semester time. compelling argument. Ok fun CANADA LOL. Aren’t guys farmers saving move Us anyways? wish someone would cut shit break everyone. ""This bad, bad. completely control there's nothing do. Nothing.

We've gotten affective treatments, yes. vitamin deficiency picks fall, colder weather starts weaken immune systems, bacterial viruses pick back up, things get ugly again. virus also currently attacking states like Arizona Florida hardest, refuse report deaths properly. lot deaths states attributed co comorbidities pneumonia. White House also charge releasing data week now, they're ones adjusting see fit. We're supposed ""the calm storm"" instead storm picking pace dramatically. can't even properly conduct contact tracing anymore. ramifications spread month going felt months said moving goalposts recall used small handful times,

And yet first instinct accuse lying? appologize even though remember using once?  No, reaction responding absolute numbers deaths comment mentioning per capita deaths. heart Donnys coattails worst slowly possible thinking thing. Glad know I'm already safe. Wow. know got bad there. can't even fathom feeling way another person. good avoided trap terrible thinking. really pin people mean ""getting back normal."" Often purposefully ambiguous way use language get think something actually saying. difference subtle - US never ""got back normal"" 9/11, sense airport functions differently - life basically resumed Americans way before. lives also could dramatically different way none us would recognize. scenarios fit ""getting back normal."" go running around like Chicken Little, I'd like little definition around think ""normal"" actually means. **Affiliation:** University Colorado, Physical Medicine Rehabilitation

Unless going doctor yearly basis checkup combined lab work (blood/urine) may never know. even checkups might catch everything. questions doctors ask seem ridiculous important. opt season though penalty? go office interview tomorrow I’m really nervous. sucks everything remote pandemic, hate I’m going go office in-person rest year risk health every day. 

I guess don’t really questions screwed think am. I’ll wearing KN95 know it’s foolproof.

/s Dumb question, understand republicans also live “Blue” states? know they’re morons assholes, you’d think they’d least thought float across tiny brains.

As atrocity isn’t messed enough is. Maybe month severely doubt it. Brazil/India/Mexico combined uncontrolled spreads, mass slums weaker health systems. Let alone rises rest Latin America elsewhere.

Catch up, people. say 'liberty security' costs... Really? threshold? I'm asking Minority Report/1984 sh*t, common sense precautions like wearing mask, washing hands, etc. Like yelling 'fire' crowded theater, point stop killing think 'we' 'me' :( Well, sure president know Constitution works, say moronic crap spews mouth Twitter.   heard people, health care personnel get quite provoced see mask wearers. Possibly case Stockholm, though. I, too, suffer intermittent tinnitus mild viral infection several years ago. sucks, hear folks permanent anosmia, realize lucky am. Wrong

And again, second compared covid flu stopped reading, clearly understand severity what’s play

Compare covid flu automatically lose sort moron would go trouble neither mask socially distance? I've telling people situation shows true depth country's math science illiteracy whole. biology whole thing makes want tear hair out.

I'm awful math even comprehend exponential growth... frustrating. Holy crap! So, bit shocked tht billboard still standing... Hello hello 👋  think get I'm saying.

The US terrible.

China much, much worse. Awesome Yeah Orange County bad think state won’t let open compared Florida. Nobody talking canada.....
Get program.

Genius.

Can less disingenuous please Given prior flu epidemics dwarf ultimate death toll COVID you’re clearly one doesn’t understand “what’s play” Perhaps targeted towards men? article even suggests ""the people sharing wild theories tend masculine persuasion"".

This article 2017 suggests anti-vaxxers way around - lot variables consider could possibly equate anything substantive regarding male stereotypes.

Stop jumping chance take potshot masculine stereotypes think critically people. I'll see new post beginning September title, July replaced August. School plays big factor. forget vaccine Oxford developed long shitstorm. Yes. pod friends similar aged kids unlikely one neighborhood. And, reduces class sizes school risk infection. attempted manslaughter Huh. wonder poor cousin denied medical care wound miscarriage. I’ll sure remind miscarriage greater good!

I've seen place is, matter is, deniers bring ""underlying conditions."" use lame excuse still deny all, happen them. maddening.

SO TF underlying conditions. Yeah, people diabetes, know what, LIVE LONG time diabetes. Even obese people live long time obese. killed COVID. They'd still alive get that. noooo, Covid kills underlying conditions. 

Well guess what, want underlying condition RAGING STUPIDITY get KILLED. absolutely comparable flu. it’s severe respects doesn’t make impossible compare. Doomers qualms comparing 1918, flu epidemic course. 

And compare relative risks? Kids simply risk covid flu. care much teachers getting slight increased risk don’t give shit kids’ risk flu year year out? OK, great. experience healthcare southern part (Småland) country. Stockholm much crisis mode, understanding need special measures probably better level there. 

I seen lot masks Södertälje, carried immigrants (which almost majority city's population). Seriously, british men seem hard time handling liquor. I’m sure already one won’t work together distribute it. I'm saying good idea, I'm saying we're inherently stuck rock hard place know way continue least damage is. I'm expert. I'm living shut three solid months even there's bit rise again.

If guess, I'm guessing going area dependent, apparently one wants hear that. think areas locked based certain criteria (ideally scaleable criteria).

I see lot people looking US one place, dozens.

What Trump gain killing old people? think that's insane suggesting liberal areas fully allowed BLM protests spread disease young, particularly minority groups. make argument, make bad choices, ultimately working towards benefit suspect there's another reason. (And record, favor ""The safe action protest. going protest anyway, measures must take protest safely possible."") getting now? It’s half year. I’d like compare positivity rates across board well right working anyone bone, economic policies destroyed economy. That's whole political discussion centered around unemployment jobs. 


You exactly talking first comment. Boooooootlicker West Chester U already stated online classes. Downingtown, online classes, Penn State kids campus, taking class dorm rooms. Public schools philly online classes.

I bet join August over.  always bothered whenever anyone quotes Joseph Stalin without attributing Joseph Stalin. mandate vaccines going schools. stretch see power extended adults well participate areas life, like going plane example go anyway shoot main street. lot parents even bare minimum. think taxpayers pay that. everything ""dear leader""

if people living democracies believe this, means democracies -- U.S. UK -- fairly weak compared to, say, Germany France. Quick skim suggests Democrats want money unemployed, money cash-strapped states/cities, money schools. Republicans want none things, also want give employers protection lawsuits infected employees. 

Not much agree on, except another round $1200 checks probably sort stimulus big companies. RIP. comment incorrect many levels. case means fewer would typically turn free charge, name, jazz gig dive bar rural... Ireland. dems tbqh

Yeah, actually put together stimulus package--eleven weeks ago! whatever, keep sucking Repub party arguing ""bUt SiDeS"" one side waiting negotiations can't even get shit together. thank comment. felt like speaking foreign language simultaneously called hateful.. But, internet, folks'll they'll credit, it’s hard extend energy private battle loved one refuses face trolls naysayers public too. like said, platform name voice.

I agree, saying something definitely better saying nothing all. almost fate. parents got sick mother survived. grandmother also didn’t make 92 year old grandfather somehow survived lung damage result. I’m afraid thing going see become fascist , lost battle America’s heart soul Trump got elected , even get office miracle next right wing fascist won’t borderline illiterate child . won’t make public mistakes Trump actually understand get shit done politically . bad Trump silver lining truly inept . next fascist won’t another one right wing isn’t changing fact becoming anti science , anti human rights , hateful , angry , armed . Ew gross  Trump actually done nothing we'd better off, instead he's hard work spread misinformation, starting conspiracy theories, casting doubts experts, weakening dismantling federal agencies regulations left right.  

I expect biden anything progressive move country forward, least actively working US. May summarize points?

You took current data ""45/100,000"" upscaled 30-50% (for reasons support. main reason use mortality precisely reasonably well-supported value. suggest counting methods 1957/1958 sufficiently different 2019/2020 methods believe 30-50% differential error?) ""60-ish/100,000"" extrapolated ""100/100,000"" 2019/2020 year (a year already ended, comparing 1957/1958).

(Note: appreciate discussion based science - thank that.) think three adult children... mean crackpot. According link less 5000 people went meeting, numbers saying many people part league.

We'd lucky small now.  RIP, seemed truly enjoy life. 

On GoFundMe family says Covid related, yet comments FB ""close friends"" say Covid (C-diff?). 

 Dat denial doe... mann. Companies run government one agenda, money.  sure does, actually whole state mask mandate problem is, qualifies ""gathering?"" Obviously weddings funerals such, eating restaurant count gathering? interact anyone outside small group server, wearing mask anyway.

Also, grocery stores would close gathering limits applied them. Dang hate Texas, best luck guys July worstbecause November yet fact current situation Frump’s fault. sowed unbelievable misinformation, removed anyone disagrees matter qualified were. fact done everything leader shouldn’t do. 

The fact Germany low number mix German people’s attitude fact leader isn’t complete idiot. 

I’m UK, really bad decisions made, fairly calm measured approach, led scientists. 

Trump considered worldwide complete joke comes attitude COVID-19. stop, start, stop, start better education routines? Hell no. Keep damn schools closed. feel long short time.
2020 nuts. yeah way people would compliant now.. people willing back spring \*bribe money paid* hope continues, nice. [By admission, it’s 100% fault. Shouldn’t 10 12 people effectively requires intent kill. Seems pretty unlikely thinking actions would kill woman, let alone proving beyond reasonable doubt. don’t think needs considered new news worth sharing. It’s shame slowly certainly places adopting becoming widely accepted PPE standard.

I live Canada read articles talking folks isolating, people coming across border shouldn’t be, tourism promotions encouraging people visit city. It’s terrifying.

No mask mandate live. 

Keep articles coming. Keep sharing data. need get. I... still pay social security. still think I'd handle y'alls morons better ones US... Sectioned treated released back society. last week issue apparently virus carried heavy air droplets masks protect. airborne ""to degree""? lol wtf

ANY degree airborne spread would mean masks wont help ever know we're environment ""a degree airborine"" covid not?

This honestly becoming ridiculous cause murdered skin tone **IS** important cause getting hammered bunch guys share hobby week. like 16 15 spun jet ski sister skipped far enough hit floating log require band aids. hospital visit required. still feel bad i'm mid 30s.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine young accidentally killing parents? fault own? can't even vote, can't even choose. going saddest thing we'll ever see. USA figure shit out. Really? I'm literally reading Reddit bed got tired playing video games hours reclined couch. ""I'm used much brainpower"" like ""I barely function hours time."" I've like months. No, shortsighted would someone sold spare tire first week didn’t need it.

8 years general dumbass Source re: hoax? bad memory still remember tetnas shot got 20 years back Rich white men need money!

Get disposable proles ball!!! play sport? Like isnt hard late another total shutdown unless want economy capitalism completely implode itself. didnt even total shutdown first time! maybe didnt half ass it, wouldnt position needing another shutdown.

the economy already took huge blow half assed shutdown is. actually got shit together imposed another shutdown right time, economy would truly implode cause even damage whats already done. Welp. Right cue.... biggest brain Navarro says, ""My view doctors' opinions dime dozen."" ""I take exception Giroir's analysis."" ""He look data last two weeks.""  


My god... Vermont wear masks Corona, go figure brother. never sounded stupid now. even little 

No. Karen's still full swing. assault assault. think that's honestly fair. Thanks dedication bio, always terrible it! I'm physics (astro weather), chem bio strong suit. yet, many people also turned subjects poor teaching school leadership. Lots things improve schooling all, progress slow. Keep encouraging young family members friends learn science! Every single person falls love STEM counts toward greater goal universal literacy. Russian propaganda machine go brrrr Medical knowledge practice improved dramatically past 100 years too. wonder COVID would like without respirators remdesivir... would someone that? count assault world. bunch people commenting clearly without bothering read understand found.

The virus may spread like mad protests. contact tracing mostly sucks US HIPAA laws making data like hard access, hard determine. Regardless, focus paper. NBER looked infection rates populations areas similar areas without protests whole.

What NBER found larger impact populations living protest areas stayed home way (determined via cellphone location data). effect, protests caused huge lockdown areas took place in. population living areas much much larger actual number people protesting, behavior important terms overall infection rates compared presumed spread protests.

As result, overall rates new cases viral spread change much areas average compared similar places without large protests, unlike expect see change behavior surrounding population.

This also explains still concerned things like political rallies schools opening sporting events--they're less likely basically scare huge population areas stay home, less likely see end effect. Beat ass. See thinks hands hoax.  He's right. kids variety learning styles kids different areas different income levels different needs. Public schools able flexible needed keep up. Hence, private charter schools spring fill gaps demand created. system pandemic work lot kids. remote learning spring also let lot kids down, public private. We're going keep trying variety new things future.  quarter million dumbest fucking people ever imagine....  #A small handful times habitual. 

You made false claim.  Feel free read comments thread comment. Lots people would fall classification moron apparently. degree BS
Everyone knows airborne. needs break away puppet masters lay line. people country give support anyone trying stop talking. Whatever. matter. Let's keep pushing masks. good pro-mask. Keep that. past past arguing believed pretty irrelevant now. 


Support government agree it, agreement, get team. know. particularly funny people say can't compare flu ones compare 1918 flu (even though nowhere nearly bad) Good point. many problems... hope takes money, uses great education, invests anything use. community fucked over.  Disponha sempre.  absolutely amazing US keep bombing sanctioning pandemic country really seems consent types genocides.

That majority people America, well Germany, Japan, Korea, etc., support American bombings sanctions. 

Just look many NGOs human rights organization condemned United States sanctions pandemic? much TV time spent discussing US sanctions pandemic? 
 
The reason discussion people support America. no, meant left insignificant western countries. like show bias Thats Belichek angling get #1 pick draft Trevor Lawrence replace Brady.

That Veterans know team isnt going good year waste year risk failure? Sit out, let team tank draft Lawrence Fields. people born Florida Man, people choose become Florida Man us handled corona fine it’s rest world lying numbers. never sprayed beaches bleach, waited herd immunity, welded people homes. shutdown, sent stimulus checks, masks mandatory stores. Massive numbers often families adopted kids.  Evans pretty lame. get people drive would never see top mountain otherwise, paved roads gift shop top really ruins experience hike it. Yeah, factor ADHD (diagnosed adult) possibly high functioning autism spectrum, tinnitus devil. really confuses people say things like this. world gone pandemics large gatherings always come back, would different? 

I see people apprehensive first come back, like flying 9/11, think March 2020 last time ever see packed stadiums/arenas crazy me. amount money/research/science focused this, I’m confident get place aren’t worrying Covid daily lives. 

My hope take things we’ve learned pandemic (masks you’re sick, higher standards cleaning public places etc) apply post-Covid lives. truly believe there’s bottom us. pathetic patchwork response going continue indefinitely. Even Biden wins, can’t make stupid states take things seriously. 

American Acceptionalism. Apparently article, one set raised $216k 

It link though might anymore Parents like would keep money keep kids home, pay schooling Also add people use website called FaceBook.com Well, estimate 5k 11k dead week. pretty big spread. Maybe we'll get lucky. (Source: 5,000 dead week awful too. isn't/wasn't much protesting taking place places may waiting see spike there. take school back session bad spreading Covid19 protests were.

So Oregon much worse Florida per capita cases deaths, since Portland protests last 60 days, yet it’s almost 5 times less fair, scientific consensus always able change new information becomes relevant. report: White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday thinks “there certainly degree aerosolization” causing coronavirus spread, although topic still studied.

“It’s something we’re learning about. We’ve got make sure we’re humble enough accumulate new knowledge use get it."" WH cut CDC data loop so, numbers suspect on. WTF talking about? 

If contact trace death you, hard prove positive result went anyways? mainstream opinion never shifted. always immensely skeptical.

Also article SARS entirely vitro. article 2017 suggests anti-vaxxers way around - lot variables consider could possibly equate anything substantive regarding male stereotypes right wing media. high school football practice started many smaller schools throughout state Monday morning, despite coronavirus cases still running rampant.
The University Interscholastic League pushed back start high school athletics Class 5A 6A schools – largest classifications state – rest state continuing scheduled.
Stafford High School, competes Class 4A, players go conditioning drills Monday. Coaches wearing masks, players also elected uses masks underneath helmets.



""while players also elected uses masks underneath helmets."" get astral sex demon, like avoid it? tell person stupid refuse wear mask. Thanks info! Might outlier potential flaws don’t think that’s fair disregard it. However, found it’s avoided potential heart complications (prolonged QTc), tho linking drug may, theory, difficult coronavirus affect heart functioning degree. think opinion stands risks outweighs potential positives. It’s use conjunction steroids might worth analyzing enough reports. Imagine actual people exist think Jesus white 😂 shouldn’t feel bad live Alabama! child molesters run office it’s close race?! Roy Moore vs Doug Jones. crappy football coach NCAA violator running Jones. Tuberville step Roy Moor much. Sure, like similar dear leader trump also left abusive father.  Colleges well. Ohio State big Ohio's pro sports mean I’m glad getting charged, abhorrent behavior.

But cancer patient really going furniture shopping pandemic hot spot? Meanwhile, Canada still sit busy restaurant without mask live.

Haven’t sat restaurant since March. take leave absence hospitality job, longer go inside grocery stores don’t (started pickup).

I wish more. virus larger quantities, lot people get needlessly sick improve PPE requirements.

Good job countries following up-to-date medical info. one week extension includes permanent addition worst Republican rider. equivalent Democrats offering give Republicans everything want coronavirus bill exchange MedicareForAll.

Clearly bullshit political move. think advantage meeting kid already formed personality. way know get along. people don't, even mean well, people click right away. advantage older child is, find someone likes offer. severe sickness country. brother's father law believe masks. examined difference prevention protection, think could actually see eyes glaze over.  Perhaps first be. learn live it. like flu season we’ll wash hands whatnot. think biggest thing would help became healthier whole. eggs could laced deadly virus... Go back /r/the_donald ... Oh wait. Yeah happened me. really bad bout flu years ago. fatigue joint pain never went away. doctors bullshit months finally saw female doc took seriously. I’m seeing rheumatologist treated autoimmune issues. pain inflammation bad I’m three immunosuppressants right now. really wouldn’t wish anyone. ✌ Schools help kids get degrees, going 98.6 100.4 biggest increase modern times. lamestream media tell that! They've recently seen massive drop new cases month ramped testing. done aggressive testing beginning, would good outcomes without lockdown, like Asian countries. South Korea's lockdown policy much different Sweden's tested way better wore masks. made difference. Truth pay pension instead. RiGhT wOrK Newsom done pretty good job, california plenty stupid well. one, worst data reporting. 7.5 YEARS pregnant. Ya know, assuming single births. Sure, continue playing dumb. irony people comment section criticizing people ignoring facts instance. Keep up, a\*\*hole. agree cancel it, without bubble inevitable fall 2nd wave mixed seasonal flu disaster . come on, see us humans, would say way biggish company views employees maybe. One difference payers get much bigger chunk revenue compared average employee makes. lot tech stocks actually showing increase profits makes sense go up, yeah, market whole premium. Tesla pure mania mode. Especially can't find anything wrong tests. fair number ailments even show tests.   forgetting Dr Stella Immanuel? agree totally. think click bait title meant interpreted way? Right! That’s Oxford/Moderna/Pfizer heroes world! Woooohoooo! Completely biased sad 😥 Canadian - knew feds would fuck everything up, thought May, americans would actually come together tackle head like happens movies like Independence Day.

Boy utterly wrong :( Thank you! doesn’t make much difference. Many facilities short staffed anticipating shortages policies require people X number days without symptoms even negative test. they’re unlikely start pulling staff they’re involved high risk activities. 

And opens worms. pull one went Disneyland probably pull ones going bars/parties/weddings etc, ones sending kids summer camp, taking vacations different states, on. Pretty quickly almost staff majority acting like idiots. know referring to, wasn’t sure still phase abandoned due complete disaster. Thank taking childish route arguing, good reminder Reddit 15. disagree, and, opinion, living reality. I'm sure young still living parents, much life experience etc., financial emergencies happen life. can't even afford mortgage/rent, utilities, car payment, student loans, groceries, gas, internet, phone, health insurance etc.....a financial emergency ruin you.

Yes, agree financial literacy discipline problem, compared problem whole think like putting band aid gaping wound.

Strong social safety nets help people afford basic necessities life, also bring peace mind. Peace mind increases quality life. live society. live independent other. interconnected. make life better people. can't hold hands them, make sure starting race 50 yards behind everyone else. 

I think warped vision society lower class people living beyond means government bailing out. believe reality. That's part. I'm sure anything talk about. good one. Anything dislike communist! Sea urchin communist! Oh I'm saying care. somebody wants throw ass extra fries them, power them. statement directly contradicts real world data.

Nobody gonna go hell 5-6 years reach fruits labour people contributed nothing struggle get 35% it. currently 21%.

You seriously underestimate effort required make profitable business.

Which exactly real investment business growth inversely proportional tax rates. Charts tables.

Where variable corporate tax rates high US (maximum bracket 15%), small businesses incentived grow marginal returns investments gonna fall. therefore, less people employed.

Consumption tax least worst tax tax rate directly based much spend therefore richer pay. that's gonna fly US new wave populism.  Imagine, actual people exist convince one another Jesus would support white pride radio. Tbh plenty problems (i.e. climate change among many things) definitely something thought prior even. said, interesting think world going look like future. article claims Sweden's economy may contracted much euro area countries. directly compare Sweden's economy Scandinavian countries. "" it’s unclear whether economy fare much better neighboring Denmark Norway, initially imposed strict lockdowns seen substantially lower fatalities.""  spread food. covid special? What’s worse- declaring bankruptcy medical emergency, assets seized brother organized protest president? public education set fail decades point. think much damage forced openings public school systems benefit pushing increased privatization. never let crisis go waste It’s one “doctors” white lab coats, right? that’s one talking didn’t really pay attention it. Anything like look government propaganda. 

I don’t know believe more. people say it’s safe kids go back school. I’m really questioning logic that. live closed mid March numbers ready low way cases suddenly it’s okay go back school? would work stable baseline compare, pandemic *only* major thing happened. E.g. guy dies afford cancer treatment lost savings stock market crash February, that's related coronavirus, far factor. okay pushing this. fear going cause people abandon pets kill them. Ah yes totalitarianism arresting people threaten murder others wanting stop killing others vs unmarked ""police"" disappearing people unmarked vans jurisdiction, warrant, legal authority walking street potentially exercisingtheir first amendment rights. see same. met anyone really opposed wearing masks, sure lot complaining everyone know complied masks. met anti-masker wild.

Oh, *this* difficult phase. So, rest cake walk. ~~Boots~~ Masks on! Paywall. Disgusting. Humans suck sometimes. could opt out. seems logical Mr. Rogers contracted coronavirus breakout Jackson Correctional Institution, transmitted disease wife. couple became sick sought medical treatment, daughter said given cough syrup sent home quarantine.

Isn’t malpractice? I’ve better care telemedicine visits call next day see I’m checking pulse O2 - even didn’t Covid. got prescriptions fill turns needed them. 

How give Covid patient cough syrup follow up. 

It sounds criminal. pretty damn annoyed Trump administration frivolous spending. “Don’t tread me, blast eardrums constant obnoxious noise.” isolating testing students, right answer.

A rapid-testing regime education involves finding outbreaks quickly. test entire classroom one kit, get positive hit, isolate follow-up rigorous tests see it. Follow contacts positive. people clean tests return.

I know that's school doing. lot smart ways handling risks involve closing week. Also front-runner vaccines developed attack receptors outside virus limited certain strain I'm also losing clumps hair due stress leave house, go work interact random people everyday. Stay put. can’t live without millions make, need check priorities. They’re living paycheck paycheck. afford work money already made. Whereas people forced teach f2f parents can’t afford work. society’s priorities screwed up. like reply one 😂😂 ""all things agree biased"" says reddit user definitely suffering confirmation bias Here's thing, quality concern apart, standard N95 KN95 differ key aspect. N95 (AND FFP2, european equivalent) need provide à tight seal mask face. KN95 required to. 

That KN95 earloop N95 headband create much tight seal. mask earloop would never pass user Fit-test matter filtration material used. Hence, cannot used health care worker.

[So many  still would amount less 1% total population dying

Why that's 3 million lives!  even bothering fight this? 

/s Husband talking wife online: honey got dildo sent you?
Wife working another state: yes hon got it. get fleshlight sent you?
Husband: sure did. So, shall we? Exactly. constant problem sub. Bogus headlines meant create fear doomscrolling. Reddit joke. 75 percent school picks distance learning. guess meant diabities overweight issues, like many elderly people seem to. Yeah idea two talking about. aren’t bitching getting hit. bitching COVID. Faxes? Really? People trying ignore it. going down, reports ground clearly contradicting WH trying say. numbers flatten decline eventually, course, we're nowhere near point yet. significant portion country never acted like California New York, never saw crisis unfold February least June, reaping sow.

Florida, Georgia, Texas, Arizona - they've already lost complete control pandemic. spent literal months loudly undermining CDC siding Trump politicize virus mask wearing, actively legally worked undermine (predominantly Democrat) mayors largest cities attempted put regulations place slow spread.

It's still going get worse gets better. going happen period, meaningful way.

First, state issue. lots states won't.

Even states want may impose lockdown, many exceptions, exemptions, non-compliant people.

When push comes shove, we're going gun violators street. that's would take effective lockdown here. got sick end September. think covid, early I've seen reports hypothesizing covid could around much earlier Dec, November. read article woman's symtoms testing positive tinnitus, hearing loss. know virus, even covid, fucked up. Still tinnitus, clogged ear feeling dizziness time. wish worst enemy. covid cases long term damage, looking nightmare scenario. Campbell may well reputable knowledgeable, swedish one not.

Sounds like fair assessment. back yard? Covid could leading cause death 3x still would amount less 0.5% total population dying. Certainly scary number lets act like odds pointing toward entire NFL roster getting wiped this... really weird all, common side effect major stessor body immune system, even change body diet - flues, pregnancy, colds, acute chronic stressors cause hair loss. temporary cases. A. couldn’t put list alphabetical order?

B. Hello Kitty betrayed us?! left emergency room University hospital Augusta work. spoke one nurses works ICU says beds available all, says every day they're treating 10 12 different patients emergency room room left ICU. says patients dropping like flies new ones coming quickly still room treat everyone. didn’t close everything WW2. People “kept calm carried on” Britain even threat bombed. PTSD alway reaction stressful event - one bring ever? would certainly helped point wore mask tv events demonstrated social distancing. Seeing people tv telling Americans basic information do, they're asking people guaranteed ineffective. 
 
Where coronavirus war bonds? multitiered national strategy? federal support states? Instead say ""the virus spreads metro areas. Infuriating. would argue, neither NFL fans. Fodder amusement. Okay hear buster - following protocol late May, early June. snuck spread like wildfire. know. Well I’m still wfh lol, can’t leave, even groceries, etc. football gets canceled players, school needs canceled teachers. IMO it’s much ofa Good Christian are. love Lord, stronger immune system bunch schools telling parents send kids in-person, class sizes 6-8.

As someone who's keeping close eye job openings seen commensurate surge teacher hiring...no ain't. definitely hiding true data, government corrupt China Russia. 
Keep wearing masks make due brutes office.
From looks everything that’s going on, seems like they’ll anything keep office (Hiding data, slowing mailing process voting, etc..) That's kind tangential evidence. businesses ordered close. designated cremation center open, course going busy. Even excluding covid-19 deaths, normal seasonal deaths could around 12000-15000 Wuhan. Deliverying 5000 urns sound crazy all. 50000, fishy.
I always refer South Korea's imported cases direct evidence, kind like sampling. SK never outright travel ban imported 18 cases, 40 times less imported USA.
There could undercounting, Wuhan told everyone stay home, asymptomatic cases never detected. based number look like underreporting.

http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/bdBoardList.do Or, prefer little scientific, ""Study Suggests Monkeys Might Fly Butt"".

More scientific: ""study suggests simian aeronautics possible anal portal."" News 11. .....I would want keep leg. matter getting 600 extra week (dems) 200 (repubs) dont come agreement 0 extra week, want jobs comprimise. Interesting, feeling may case good get supporting data.

So thus far yet see real second wave we're definiing wave truly calamtious outbreak like New Orleans, NYC, Stockhold, Madrid, Wuhan, etc. That's somewhat comforting 20% seroprevalence burn out/herd immunity actually accurate. Cause unfortunately point places like US looks like we're headed unless vaccine turns miracle that's promised underlying conditions?  So?

It's obvious parents part ""1%"". need people try shame parents looking children's best interest disgust me. willing make financial sacrifices cares.

Yet another mother brought fact many white parents pulled kids public schools 1954 Brown v. Board Education case, U.S. Supreme Court justices ruled unanimously racially segregating children public schools unconstitutional, Rich began think differently joining pod. 

So SJW tell woman she'll ""bad person"" joins pod. mother reconsiders expense child's education lose ""woke"" status?

 Unless given ""privilege"" name equality shaming anyone else. I’ll gladly take $80 million treated “human”. huge number Redditors prepping COVID thing quite time seems. Call cab line thinking needs stop. Say indoors shopping. Someone coughs without mask. leave cloud basically minutes. Someone else without mask walks cloud. person may infected.

Just wear mask times. many people think stay away people easily. know meant. need belabour obvious. One glass wine put legal bac level .08%. trust everything say. think social pods social bubbles good idea. tell people socialize all, going rebel. telling safe way socialize limiting risk widespread exposure covid much better way handle it. 

We social bubble like since May issues EU makes sure Sweden gives money EU countries hit harder economically due corona virus (supposedly). end, Sweden gets deaths.  appears sort genetic issue comes severity Covid, age. also (have told to) think moderate candidate dangerous Marxist. tax plan pres run literally Sim H., flat tax.

Except poor _maybe_ income tax.

So what, there's cliff 0% 9%? sales tax corporate tax basically tax poor people.

So broke make $109.89 per unit time, pay $9.89 income tax (or maybe not, knows [2]) get $100 take-home.

Then spend whole $100 necessities living. $18 also taxes, sale somewhere else corporation, corporation's income consumers, pass tax onto you. far understand corporate tax regressive tax wearing skin progressive tax.

You end something like **25.38% effective tax rate**, hidden behind ""taxing big corporations"" except corporations mostly make money poor people, can't print money cover taxes without raising prices people. (Or cutting salaries - poor people)

Now imagine rich make $109,890 per unit time. pay $9,890 income tax get $100,000 take-home.

You spend $1,000 necessities luxuries, incurring $180 sales / corporate taxes. invest $99,000 index fund emergency fund full. Leave index fund appendix.

If rich paid **9.16% effective tax rate** year. rest money stored somewhere. might pay 9% capital gains future, principal. Either way extremely favorable you, cost-of-living 1% income, 100%. Congratulations, Job Creator!

I'm economist, pulled leftie ass man hate flat taxes.

Appendix capital gains:

Herman's plan said neutral capital vs. labor income. Right long-term capital gains taxes 0% $77,000 per year married. [1] live nice lifestyle $77k per year spending. point, taxed 15%. must note, _way_ less pay _labor income_ middle-class chump. 15% bracket reaches $479,000, probably money I'll ever able save life, counting capital gains shitty little IRA.

[1] Tax cliffs benefit cliffs also stupid. Setting standard deduction higher helps some, kind doubt Herman plan that.  Ironically, lot players probably show reason many essential workers did; cant afford to. There's definitely reason top class talent play, come on. Padded stats possible second string players + one likely years make millions Lots us states can't.

Here TX, strike, state take licenses away (meaning we're job), also take away anything we've earned pension payouts. Lots districts social security contributions teachers--meaning lose pension, SOL.

And someone asks ""bUt cAn'T fIrE tEaChErS tHeY?"", 2020 real fuck around find vibe it. would surprise see Abbott, Patrick, Paxton pull Reagan fire every single teacher went strike, even mass strike. Dude, you’re joking, people actually used similar argument excuse Cops people running protestors cars vans. love it! Honeys want without bling, baby. Gotta get chedda!

But seriously, true. players short careers, usually less 4 seasons. players ""raining money"" type. Factor union dues taxes, players taking home 50% salaries. realize make money short amount time, expect money support rest lives.

Once retired, buckle control expenses, broke quickly. Leaving house anything days could considered ""risky behaviors"". point, stop afraid everything live life. someone house immunodeficiency, fine, lock down. Otherwise, use whatever help kids succeed. plenty research essentially says kids low risk anyway. Suddenly alienating everyone names Karen Chad smells exactly like vodka. I’m advocating billionaires we’re talking big business. Building stadium, cutting checks staff overhead involved... need billionaire cover costs, no? you’re making many many millionaires process! Firemen make quarter average football salary much higher risk. Canada lot idiots too, high percentage USA. USA around ~40% pathetic morons (Trump approval) Canada 20% Unexpected deathsentence would care date data... friend sent video safely say watching infuriating end. type blatant racist would fly Im Atl. turned Deb, huh? Spending money save money.

No, like spending money instead B. mention approval red tape local state governments. None easy, quick.

It's 5 MONTHS. plenty still daycare/discipline aspect it.

Teachers baby physically classroom ten times better child teacher alike comes providing education

10 times obviously bullshit statistic. person learning better degree given circumstances, remote seems like pro-life still solved issue school lunch providing ""safe space"" children escape abusive/broken homes.

Schools provide bagged lunches like doing. Sending kids covid infected building qualify ""safe endless distractions may face home (including siblings)

Parents need step up. parents need work

And federal government needs step too. Again, 5 MONTHS prepare this. thought said state country even question embarrassing world stage right now. see county. Oops. Yeah absolutely. know we’re talking businesses red here. guess splitting hairs ‘profit’ means context worker ownership. Breaking even goal. Wow, understand things market, like supplements vitamins regulated. surprised many hand sanitizers getting market. hope ""Think economy!"" becomes new sister meme ""Think children!"" watched news last night heart sank. really wish best rest life. really really sucks people still blame China hiding numbers, expected fuck excuse? Best case criminal incompetence/negligence, worst case they're shit purpose. Asian countries also mask using culture. Wonder it’ll work put peanut butter camera lens dog? incorrect malnourishment. However, also possible malnourished high caloric intake. 

My proposition diet features minimal caloric intake healthier one maximal intake. suggestion perhaps current idea minimal line drawn rather high. certainly argue maximizing nutrient intake worse minimizing it. Welcome capitalism realise comment pointing many places heavily underreporting? Belgium, Germany, Sweden example atre either higher Covid-deaths excess deaths least close other. bet people questioning report say fucking peep report came protesting cause rise cases. Anything fit y'all's agendas. gross. Someone needs get 150,000 mannequins crash test dummies keep adding pile numbers go up. think need stronger visuals. Apparently hospital ship [mass NYC effect people... stop demonizing mental illnesses label harmful. I'm afraid liberals=saviors

Well mean...

*looks askance executive branch.* 

*looks askance Senate.* 

Um, point? Exactly, like running pedestrians car screeching ""muh rights! right drive walking crosswalk! Crosswalks r librul hoax! Hurrr"" completely braindead aiming ""zero deaths"" simply unrealistic.

The way we're going zero deaths delorean thunderstorm. talking Vitamin while. started see benefits, started taking it. right unproven also pretty harmless people increase levels. Low risk, high reward! teen ? look least 30.  people seem approve gatherings, regardless mask use social distancing, meet certain criteria good cause. consumption media determines lot feel. constant supply headlines like, “_____ state hits new high daily cases”, “We surpassed _____ deaths”, “Hospitals _____ nearly capacity”, “New cases starting tick _____”, etc.

F/e, consider Arizona several weeks ago. media message pure doomsday cases would never slow hospitals would capacity forever. Cases hospitalizations come steadily past two weeks. Texas Florida hit peak cases moving since (I haven’t looked California). 

As cases gone people pointing change reporting bypassing CDC. don’t need look data HHS look state reporting resources.

Providers adapted using ventilators effectively treatments remdesivir helped. 

It’s we’re woods yet positives. Positive news doesn’t drive clicks it’s easier think worst case scenarios. 

If want way measure what’s happening look stock market forward looking - things getting worse and/or future bleak market would heading down. Yes fantasy - moved goalpost significantly. I'm sorry, student difficult... Especially joke majors kids D1 have. Beyond that, work something do, one said kids play sport college. 

Stop equating modern day student athlete ""plights"" struggles workers 19th early 20th century. forgetting third option stay open cases roll act like nothing could done. seem doing. disagree lot people seems. mean that’s really harsh. someone read situation said you? “Don’t go work month Stephen; need better lifestyle.” I’m small enough company happened us someone premie twins. Like, look insurance. you’re for?? bit pointless statistic, considering US Brazil always lower numbers Sundays Mondays weekend. missing cases get reported rest week.

India seem kind weekend dip. Well perhaps help Chinese population United States don’t think they’re harvesting organs China. shut beginning yet see states significantly higher cases (my state Ohio example) staying open, sending kids back school. It’s wild think  made Office Space comparison wife couple days ago. tragic.

All tragic easily preventable common sense.

And even tragic stupid seems ... , taunt ""come kill me, come kill me, dying""


Just suggestion, someone please write ""Doh!"" gravestone? can't even begin unpack idiocy. goats confused call Skype Red idiot. people idiots.  Ya exactly.

It's like he's public school teacher forced go work. guy sit 150k return next year unpenalized. athletes get perpetual victims, acting like theyre slaves owners even harmful label such. Covid-19 survivors don’t enough health issues worry dr: So, stfu please. 

This testing causes Coronavirus cases level thinking. It’s Reddit version Rule 34. imagine it, there’s subreddit it. say, bad weather, bad gear, something like that... think take day day. several promising vaccines ramping production. also least one phase 3 trial results September. truly don’t think fall bad people want (for reason) lot folks podding kids friends. So, families already exposed anyway. aren’t many families still haven’t contact families, even interact changed. decide gets pod excluding anyone loose contacts parents. Ain't truth. teachers/faculty? 

Mask stay distant. I'd support P100's teachers, even write check right won’t kids eventually spread amongst parents several months? 

We need *some* level surveillance testing. saliva tests swab kids' noses, group tests. 

Ideally we'd daily. Maybe settle weekly. often it, accept high error rates. Please tell it’s called TLM Oh stupidity contagious, gave Canada. Take look [US central bank assets ballooned since 2008. context, look [Canadian central less 5%. 

Instead government paying back debt well, propping economy since 2008. result, central bank owns 20% US economy. leaves little wiggle room; hard increase interest rates owe trillions. stimulus money stops flowing people forced face reality, going worse great depression, feels like government little interest helping little guy. going take long time recover impending mega depression. You’re lying. shared feelings reality. Sounds like visit bankruptcy counselor hear done health insurance luxury. can’t common sense kind money, pity. someone please explain ""people"" , sit room 20 people 3 hours, even wearing surgical mask, matter, enough stuff gets outs, it'll like sitting room full virus.


Wear mask, open essential oil put drop corner room, eventually smell despite mask. Fantasy indeed. 5 examples including academic research anecdote.

Cling hard narrative. squeeze hard enough .......it still bullshit. dad died April able funeral, memorial sort service him. part hurt especially massive outpouring people wish could there. know best mean hurt less, people gathering, live different time norms used never same. would owners players strike? live Georgia, full morons take seriously.

*Edit: Like day someone called sheep wearing mask working, told hoax. Perhaps call things actual physical disorders realising actually physical disorders. Mental health sounds like somebody forgetting go mental gym brainexercise. saying I'm right. We'll know August 30th. high estimated daily deaths shy 1600/day. stays low lower, estimates good. 

They wrong April believe (though need double check memory, could well wrong). predicted range 70-100k end June. 120k. 

In end though, time tell. hard predict future. Human behavior vagaries society really hard predict. 

We come back end every month next three see. I'm perfectly happy wrong! (and expect be) It’s America whole. Individuals speak popular vote wasn’t fool. bad actually? sun sea tempting. UVC safe, used night... less safe used around living possible eye skin damage. Swedish model based culture wanting ""that guy"". everyone else part social distancing, people want guy don't. makes people follow recommendations without need rules. Americans almost retarded. Dont worry it. Could also true swine flue? Ever since back 2009 chronic fatigue syndrome Hey, leave NM this! accounts great -- blip July due holidays, back control far! wonder long stay random.

lel Useless comment, potato. Try make argument least. comment like screaming: ""Sponsorship/influencer marketing work!"" empty room  Americans sent donations, thoughts prayers loved ones China Chinaflu. virus arrived here, became “just flu” bad things don’t happen blessed nation. ""they"" pushing reporting truth? says half people cough fatigue fully resolved 3 weeks. mean 3 weeks it'll resolve, mean it'll never resolve? There's huge difference public health perspective ""35% covid-19 patients may take 2 months fully recover"" ""35% covid-19 patients may never fully recover"". honestly probably jackasses heavy pushes reopen businesses. really mean ""open schools force lower wage workers can't afford daycare back work."" thought outdoor protests linked increase transmission? joke right?

In state (Washington), areas high levels mask usage seems things suffer like you’re talking about.

Plenty people using masks valves, uncovering noses, wiping eyes, etc.. still need make progress people’s understanding masks play role several precautions need made. Eh Men’s Wearhouse/Jos Banks (one company since merger) trending downward really long time. better options finding suit lower prices, sales teams lost sense expertise, push styles aren’t relevant anymore.

""convince American WORK TOGETHER greater good?"" ""stop"". please lump conservatives anti covid/pro trump crowd. voted GW really agreed obama did.

Summer holidays basically week, long go normal traffic returning. 

FHM said recommend keeping distance, working home (recommended end year least) , skipping Gyms etc, taking car/bike instead public transport instead widely enforcing masks, mean recommending personal use. 

Right debate upcoming autumn traffic busses trains distance kept hoping thinking going recommend masks trains/busses least. ""We pandemic preparedness team people China need lets get rid it"" - Disasters 2018 would teaching kids? online learning, would teaching students another teacher would teaching children. heart disease could spread cough, would locking lol wife need academic study prove I'm idiot. report kid going training without mask

EDIT: [Found even figure coming line death toll originally forecast White House towards start pandemic. April, Deborah Birx White House Coronavirus Task Force said models showing U.S. could expect 100,000 240,000 coronavirus deaths strict social distancing measures. time, figures questioned, experts saying little information calculated.

This estimate WH actually accurate Around week later, Dr. Anthony Fauci told NBC's TODAY Show White House death toll estimate probably high, saying would likely closer 60,000. line forecast IHME.

Oh look, beloved Dr. Fauci one made incorrect estimate! Nothing hate on? interest. That's works anything China-related Reddit. Dave speak less fair, football players caliber average career 2 3 years. Given you’re top tax bracket, pay big fees agent, dedicated life football, may walk away football age 25 $400,000 banked (if you’re rare one sensible long term planning age), directionless career income. first glance looks like making bank like cardiovascular surgeon it’s great position players self defeating argument? idea many died 1918?

If Biden elected, point term get vaccine and/or numbers drop enough COVID considered ""over"" proves hoax.

Maybe hitting people pocketbooks takes finally people mask up. Democratic platform healthcare 'status quo'. 

It is. ""more Obamacare changes, maybe, pass them"" 
Obamacare already watered get anything progressive past congress. We're still going Obamacare, still unaffordable, millions still without insurance coverage middle global pandemic. Timid half-measures need right now. Providing coverage illegal immigrants top ridiculous. medicare would cheaper would gotten support people need fastest. expansion would driven costs made easier negotiate lower drug prices too. TIL thanks! point relevant research? r/unexpectedhamilton district said it’s rare children pass adults. Rare doesn’t mean doesn’t happen. It’s good enough. ....dude...


My whole point schools NFL happen year. NFL going cancelled two weeks. Schools going closing two weeks. idea point trying make disagreeing said originally calling naiive.

Yup, I'm used CVS, JoAnn, etc. scanning loyalty card/coupons counter I've forgotten mine, I'm kind drifting really thinking anymore. 

That said, mad said deal, though! least plan listen people smarter advice. cared people dying. Doesn’t Missouri high case count? test everyone every day. limit tests situations think might exposed need go high-contact area. (school, visit someone, etc) symptoms, etc.

And cost $1. could given free.

It would massive game changer. Come Indiana ""free"" testing still billed insurance &amp; 10-14 day turnaround time. way get  result within 2 days - go doctor, meet certain criteria, &amp; agree pay testing (because insurance possibly pay type tests available 2 hospital networks).

I’m guessing we, like local colleges, probably recess Thanksgiving March. great thing boot anyone agree level isolation. get into, must quarantine test negative. partake risky activities permanently. can't control everything, small groups work okay. I'd never trust larger setting know people personally tho. would everyone could comprehend it. Part doesn’t human mind isn’t inherently capable grasping exponential growth. There’s reason, least US, February, virus seen “Wuhan” problem problem seemed pretty far away us, come March, everything everyone went lockdown. Oh fair. cities shut month, others tried 2 weeks even bold strategy restrictions all. gave banks trillions citizens bucks. even day Trump spoke fondly masks Lone Ranger!

As masks: know medical grade face masks, worn handled properly, effective. problem general public great access medical grade face masks, absolutely know handle properly. Touching mask, pulling mask down, wearing mask nose, re-using masks way longer should, things make wearing mask counter-productive. masks give people sense false security, start relaxing measures *actually* keeping safe, like keeping distance others.

Every remember story, wonder lady now... medicated hopefully. ahh simpler times, miss him. remember broadcasting saying Americans repelled capital US troops photobombed interview. Borrowing money actually great idea think hyperinflation.   Dam strategy claim voter fraud (election fraud actual problem many states) raise bar passes acceptable mail-in ballot. people sure difference mail-in ballot absentee voting. difference mostly demography.

You see, older people tend vote absentee. order vote absentee, many states require either military service prevents going polls elderly. groups vote right, balance pro-Trump.

If states allow voters vote-by-mail, would two distinct categories VBM: absentee no-excuse absentee. no-excuse absentee voters would voters forced vote-by-mail. absentees would demographically older military.

So see Republicans would want create framework challenging no-excuse absentee votes. friend whole family got family anti maskers literally CNA nursing home.... even critising all? Pretty sure lady ten kids cancer patient/victim above, I'm reading things right. 

I concede ten kids seems bit excessive me, really see anything suggest irresponsible understand contraception. Heck, maybe kids adopted!

Damn, get scarier dont know long term implications might be. someone try return dress asked receipt showed picture wearing dress. mean thanks showing proof dress worn can’t return still what’s thought process there? got point.  Well people could getting twice symptoms, think already tested positive once, probably cold something. don’t know long immunity lasts new virus don’t think dismiss overly scared something make \*me\* cowardly? matters government financing debt printing money, eventually lead inflation (and arguably already certain areas, like asset prices). See tell actually knowledge subject regurgitating talking points. 

You right drive. also license anything buy drive car, want drive car public roads. 

Your argument want carry permits. Great, let's make get carry permit effective nationwide like drivers license. responsible gun law. Better yet, seeing wording keep BEAR, guaranteed right carry gun without infringement government thusly requiring permit carry gun blatant violation everyone's rights. care peoples rights?

Did know globally gun ownership correlates lower violent crime?

Did know crime prevented use firearms America crime committed use firearms? Making guns net positive America's crime rates.

What responsible gun law? making expensive type firearm used less murder hammers responsible gun law?

Is passing unenforceable laws make firearms difficult access emergency responsible gun law?

Is passing laws make harder poor people second ammendment right responsible gun law? hate poor people?

Is making gun companies, unlike companies, responsible actions citizens take product responsible gun law? bring cars, Chevy responsible drunk drivers? course fucking not. overt attempt put gun companies business people can't buy guns. 

Is law requires firearms less reliable responsible gun law?

Are arbitrary limits rifles even though handguns make 98% gun crime responsible gun laws?

Is making can't order gun local gun store using internet responsible gun law?

Is requiring license constitutional rights responsible gun law?



Hey, know national firearms act pay $200 fully automatic machine gun? Write representatives today tell repeal national firearms act today!


But right, one going take guns. try, held accountable enemies nation, supporters. Americans stripped constitutionally protected rights convicted court law. Legislation cannot strip constitutionally protected rights thus law trying unjust law all.


All beside point anyway. hate science love fascism supporting gun control want. fact matter large portion country, fact democrats want attack peoples constitutional rights simply nonstarter win places it. Rusty axe? feel like we’ve seeing lot crazy people like recently. It’s internet, I’ve seen wacky stuff public too. can’t one thinks this.

I wonder it’s caused quarantine. Lock bunch people months they’re released back public act like animals. never discounted variables. say testing dropped 6%. combine Thirty-one states positivity test rates 5%, according analysis, including Alabama 22%, Mississippi 21%, Florida Kansas 19%. 

It makes go, ""Hmmmm.""  able find studies showing zinc doesnt work? Wow already bad before. Actually solution sit home nothing.

We (not us, people things I'm list) went bars, restaurants, met friends. Companies switched messaging from, ""Stay Home, Stay Safe, together"" ""Fuck lockdown worst, going stir crazy, come Ted's Meat Bucket Shack home $3 Meat Bucket all-you-can-eat nachos WORLD'S LARGEST NACHO TROUGH, ABLE FEED 50 HUNGRY PATRONS TIME!""

When asked sacrifice good everyone generations go war, build great works, plant victory gardens. time though lack leadership selfish people ever existed, task literally staying home nothing eluded us.

People missed getting pampered service workers demanded head back breach. People work service jobs saw help forthcoming government decided go back work face ruin. 

That try explain future generations, ask, ""Why US poorly? get sick? videos people going coughing people making fun wearing masks? wrong everyone?"" Luckily us, pandemic indicator America handle future catastrophes, simply say, ""Don't worry that, need keep walking north see find arable land potable water, Nestle finished draining aquifers Mexico Canada accepting anymore climate refugees."" may interest develop long term symptoms strategies somewhat effective CFIDS/ME may help suggesting completely crashing economy allow restart economy faster? Yep.. stated initial study anyone gander Totally fine hope nothing happens but... get sick, die home without cluttering health system. used attend school county work in. county bringing back students face-to-face, without mandatory masks, August 13th. Thankfully many students opted virtual instruction, still several hundred students schools. Reading stories like Justin’s close us blows mind much taking seriously. could happen ANYONE.  Truman reservoir much prettier quieter tbh..... Heart disease kills 5 times many. still think covid worse. Lol I'm D1 athlete also double majoring biology psychology. athletes choose ""easy"" majors. rough trying balance 20 hours practice week much, more, school work average college student. Further, many employers graduate schools look research experience internships completed undergraduate studies, adding yet another commitment. Many teammates also work part time jobs top sport class work.

To address statement ""kids [don't] play sport college"", many athletes use sport way go college.

Which, combined drop testing, suggests virus still spreading control.   judging rest posts timeline, seriously doubt supported blm. yup one knows wear mask updates Joey Vatto Matthew Stafford? Oh boy, playing 19 millions year 99.5% chance survival? Tough choice Yeah going happen. People ate tired restrictions going back normal. Unfortunately making virus spread even further.

Lol might want google N95 material works, well certain particle sizes filtered due different effects (brownian motion, mechanical filtering, well electrostatic charge meltblown material) rethink statement. problem person gets negative rapid test, feel like they're sick, take precautions.

But huge gatherings people spread virus matter someone goes Disney World? Covid backdraft. Perfect conditions burn beyond control.  Outdoor protests lots masks proven insignificant spread. obvious everyone now? Tons evidence supports that. Theaters dying slow death already. Coronavirus quickened death somewhat

Really, thing keeping theaters alive Disney. Disney fully transitions Disney+ VOD big budget movies, big theater chains die off, even without pandemic going Agreed, little reductive. certainly ways add housing, easy. suggest would require large investment, first simply buy property (assuming current owners even willing sell, given considering rent make) knock what's build it, especially considering building codes quake-prone area, etc. also reclaim land bay and/or ocean, that's cheap. Portuguese government was. we're getting slaughtered. Yup, keep wondering racism race. really, specific grouping whites. Christian conservative anti-science Fox News whites.

Master race, sure ain't, based morons. Yes ofc.

And seem heart attacks go doctor immediately.


It still answers question quite well:

How Coronavirus pandemic affect deathrate? One fucking person saying ""a lot [cases] severe"" mean virus lethal

And asked fucking headline, unrelated single quote, dumbass So... Ten days hotel quite pricey people necessarily available demand entire time frame, plus limited ability store/prep food unless there's kitchen (so money). RV might work one hookups available somewhere nearby, otherwise expensive rent even available. Tent probably technically cost efficient widely available, quite set make reasonably comfortable sick person, especially summer, and, again, food storage/prep issue. Plus, there's issues food delivery regularly checking several times every day make sure nothing escalated (sick people great sure time get help). who's say they're giving accurate picture health (it's common minimize issues worry people)? many calls try going over? goes answer call?

Also, people contagious days showing symptoms getting positive test result (since people rarely get tested prior symptoms unless absolutely know exposed). So, chances are, someone gets sick, sick unless normally spend much time together. 

Edit: actually, shed backyard would probably nicer tent. might least electricity using extension cord. Unless second bathroom outside access, also hygiene sanitary issues. even afford car New York salary? Like, get car costs gas slightly expensive, cost parking--not using even not. Maybe lease includes parking spot, still paying it. saw guy I-80 wyoming weekend wearing sleeveless jacket huge ""sons arthritis"" patch back...super funny current man shut USA. next leader well might.

To naysayers, first shut radical too. never expected shut first time due disease either. Period. Strange things happen strange times. 

The need still clearly there. economy might well benefit short-term lockdown helps restore national confidence. second (or first nationwide) lockdown seems strongly supported many accredited experts. America richest country world. light-years ahead shit little context.
In last 2 months serological screenings many areas italy.
Because screenings local virus hit differently different regions statistically ""accurate"" campaign supported ISTAT started.
Of originally planned 150k tests 64k performed.
The result least 6 times infected official numbers (that would make sense scale death rate). I'm still sure replied me. talking woman photo all. humans empathy can't speak Florida. Alabama numbers trending down. hospitalizations leveled considerably couple weeks, daily hospitalizations trending down. numbers reported locally mostly liberal mayors hospital admins. believe numbers fudged. deaths trending past week. 

Huge change Alabama significant increase wearers masks. started taking masks seriously numbers spiked 4th July. Completely different that. Maybe we'll deal less assholes ripping neighborhoods overly loud bikes. understand line reasoning. I'm commenting three-year-old laptop, people can't really live without technology. required jobs, communication, etc. industry around goods that's problem, culture buy-then-throw-away. Endless consumption unsustainable causes social, environmental economic issues.

It's saying ""Oh ho ho criticize capitalism require laptop it?"" like saying coal miner demanding better wages safety ""Oh, criticize coal company mine pickaxe capitalism made?"" oh boy... global warming, suits needed go anyway — linen wrinkles way easily, every gent carry seersucker 😎 Nothing added opinion justifies assume anyone covid/ covid synptoms dies, died result virus. fantasy misleading. Professionals government need transparent.

Is true, nothing said made true.

I fully aware excess deaths related COVID. know fact suicides whatsnot. fact though trend downward \*any\* non-COVID disease. say truth it, would see numbers COVID going down. People continued die causes exact rates before, simple right now. One wondering, statement fact. That's like 1% yet cases plummeted suburbs. going possible people city.

Call walk use park. Wear masks, stay apart. Pretty easy. Reservations only. numbers Florida feds? understanding nobody using CDC data since lagged, using data scraped state's websites. ""Countries women leaders appeared well. I'm sure coincidental.""

It's...coincidental. basic correlation =/= causation statistics 101. God people sure stupid, would happen American chance? think that's stronger correlation, anything. Mask mandates likely answer. downward trend hospitalizations started weeks mandates came effect % people wearing increased drastically. Also, Ducey closed gyms bars extended closures *ding*
BRING DEAD! last sentence mean then? Interesting. alerted study group? ods best perpetuate terrible decision. thinking? comment makes one single kid bring home parents, unnecessary.  

If damage anyway. Finally get put vast knowledge Aaron Burr trivia good use! lords work, one day time. 🙏🏼  actually meant students already enrolled. take gap year middle college delay graduation. International students, required military service, take gap years. go back college older much responsible. like someone said above. community service contact tracing instead? Would probably look much better resume... following testing days. happened Texas? everyone school online instead proposal hear that. I've plenty times never experienced horror reddit speaks of. fact, enjoyed times there. consumer alternative alternative sure.

But unless looking pull roof building doesnt really much theater right now, Johnson talking here.

Whats probably going happen lot independently owned theaters going go bust. AMC's world credit lines survive they'll pick carcasses whats left re-open ever corporate approved. thing going happen tons industries, restaurants, concert venues, retail whole hell lot more. M&amp;A huge post crisis. What's even closed? Bars 10pm? Finnish media fixing reports convenience Swedish Health agencies? Read again: article 4th April So, it’s always simple emotions involved.. parents flawed humans like anyone else would hope would best minimize conflict front child, also think flip side never seeing conflict unhealthy.. Children need also understand conflict part life isn’t necessarily bad thing, think need make sure conflicts handled civilly presence. 

As parent (and divorced one that) I’m sure I’ve done fair share mentally screw somehow despite best effforts good parent be.. gf 4 kids go homes it’s tough ever something could mentally detrimental someone whole situation (for example, I’m sure favor children favors hers, although try that, it’s necessarily bad thing, could see kids seeing different light).

Anyway, point don’t blame parents unless truly awful humans, normal flawed humans understand trying best failed specific things issues with.. holding blame forgiving generally unhealthy hold back healing. also work way around. Less people die car accidents work accidents full lockdown. also count lives virus 'saved'? ah yeah discredited research swedish institute pushing herd immunity, typical dishonesty Whilst troubling flare up, least state point view take comfort protective measures mandated. Admittedly might feel naught citizens obeying, understand penaltys getting stricter response this? luck, get back control :) America world heard? HOaX Fun fact: lot mushrooms create vitamin exposed sunlight (the fresher better, long cooked frozen still bit this), get some, slice leave couple hours sun, good way get extra vitamin D. Nothing like organizing football games kids pandemic... say nothing carelessness infections school thinking merely day two cleaning remedy problem. might release movies directly rental. Guessing home theater sales up. *late* exists mind... plane catch turn 18 something?

What one year going ends saving thousands lives? Where? Fuckin where? 50 states easy. Name 20 states they’re top name support federal level. wtf talking abusive spouse lol. realize death rate 47/100000. actual tested vs death rate bogus. point probably half US exposed it. Still dont want downplay risk guys fear mongering fucks. Yeah sure. SALT changes used itemize taxes without mortgage. 

Don't forget add car there, too. go test negative, get fired lose pension worked 20 years for. Somewhere George Zimmer laughing.

God damn... thought like employer takes x% wage Gucci (have insurance) pay medical treatment... Shit that's messed :/ Stick backyard, obviously.  can't be? way life far many U.S. :( Öre(sunds)bro bridge? :P  people work choice. Like someone would choose work minimum wage restaurant could engineer doctor.. Sure, deny acknowledged. denials, however, simply propaganda fit reality demonstrated past statements basically actions. I'm sure Ivanka Jared's spawn also staying safe remote. Spoken person actively trying ruin country. Depends blocks streets frequent. Mission Downtown Market/Turk common places see poop/urine. assured sub month ago virii **always** mutated become less lethal. Reddit PhDs wrong?? Well gee looking past 4 years especially last 6 months *it's almost they're pretty damn important.* fridge trucks Florida Texas ""over flow"" (absolutely horrifying). think might also California right now. order freezer trucks deal dead people need shut (and 50% shut 2 weeks). last shut US 9 states even lock down. know people worried economy seriously tax rich. 83 millionaires signed open letter asking government tax pay Covid-19 expenses. 

This open letter 83 millionaires say Covid-19 taxes: 

The letter says: ""No, ones caring sick intensive care wards. driving ambulances bring ill hospitals. restocking grocery store shelves delivering food door door.”

""But money, lots it. Money desperately needed continue needed years ahead, world recovers crisis.""

“So please. Tax us. Tax us. Tax us. right choice. choice.”

Our government needs make right choice stop saying theres money help people. There's plenty money people need find make available. importantly going want help people us beat covid. you, Donnie? maybe SIL? 😆🤣🤨 ... Nice try are, simple decision, I’m sorry, that’s feel dont think schools starting up? least big universities online? kind things see person say think ""well, case, carry on!"" makes think people things do! listen people saying ""we're gonna live years years"". can't wait know virus really is, people get barely symptom others coma 4 months! non 5 digit numbers, 11,000 per week, little 1,500 per day, little 65 per hour, approximately 1.1 per minute... better?

Does need /s remember need 60-70% population get herd immunity (""going back normal"").

We need maybe 45%, possibly less. 60-70% old “models” really napkin math. New models look things like super spreaders, consider likely viral loads, populations interact, etc. models say need significantly less people herd immunity. think Spanish flu ever got 50%, example. Sure problem. everyone forgot except reason lies - expired pandemic every post, Americans cannot see outside bubble.

Wishing guys best. Idiocy universal, reading whats happening melbourne concerning far familiar. they? deaths per capita well Germany, Denmark, France, Norway UK, Spain, Italy, Belgium. Feels like higher end also one best economic outcomes. YES!!!! **Say again, bring friends** Oxyoxymoron really, no?

Take situation:

My school starting virtual **MIGHT** go person late fall later year hard resign unknowns. Right reason delevoping baby may alive may due good insurance given employer allows get great Healthcare. Last week sent hospital labor delivery (in second trimester) get special treatment prevents chance preterm birth higher risk given condition have. Would received treatment complication without best insurance job resigned? Maybe not. 

Many us, especially us depend job insurance get necessary treatment weigh factors. always simple.

The death rate corona troubling. .2 percent pregnant women get corona die. chance losing baby preterm birth WITHOUT expensive treatment provided insurance 20%. dramatically higher rate dying corona. 

So.... right now.. best bet try keep job insurance manage pregnancy complications... hope school stays virtual go labor. I'm extremely skeptical change trend since data started reported directly White House. Florida Georgia manipulating numbers too, imagine what's happening now. 

Don't think little suspicious Florida 10k cases since CDC stopped getting data? change lockdowns mask rules, sudden virus got less contagious? Texas stopped reporting weekend.  CDC keeps changing guidelines dental practices. little oversight. check dental hygiene message boards see complaints staff swept rug. realize Q1 includes two months, right? might see functional vaccine. Oxford making good progress provided model, future prediction. wish people would understand Christians nihilistic well. going crash pandemic priced recession bound happen. Recession signs showing 2019 already. might recession without pandemic, would pretty close 0% growth. supply proper, high quality evidence main organ declaring strategy ""herd immunity"", theory easily debunked **high quality information** organ. suggesting definition conspiracy, which, said, sub rules. Try follow rules please.

The YouTube channel talking would also classified built conspiracy theory. story sounds like bull shit Arizona great ever since masks became mandatory close businesses, like bars gyms. Arizona proof control outbreak simple mandates without lock entire economy. parts United States take notice, like California, Still thick surge Sure problem. everyone forgot except reason lies - expired pandemic father one politicians politicizing it. He's passive victim. It’s rumored unemployment numbers bigger news. 'US entering 'increasingly worse almost completely control' phase Covid-19 outbreak' 


FTFthem teach school near Seattle one students lost parents Covid back March. Horrible. two first deaths US. Horrible. I’m sure average age riders 50+. biker events Harley riders general older generation never really made younger generation. mention we'd losing lives workforce already dwindling even happened, especially tragic lower income areas schools already understaffed is.

Real damned damned situation. politicians tried stop pandemic got here... Moneyyy makes life happyyyy~ USA continues climb number one !!! #USA Ha ha ha test tell active virus. 2 week lab culture. actually super important know, done large outside South Korea ""reinfections"". That's huge misstep. possible processes followed reporting determining reinfections, big reason cases considered suspicious.

Furthermore, claiming 3 months, actually already seeing NYC, big reason I'm suspicious report. still walk eggshells around niece nephew sister bought taught young age. really tough nephews love dinosaurs think died flood.

I can't even discuss different periods fossil record believe existed time world made seven days.

Having worked science center, enough make sick, know seeding understandings helped break free ignorance.

Oh yeah, dad called anybody gets checked Coronavirus stupid family dinner last night thinks everybody get back work, get herd immunity, stop making big deal everything sure overlap two. Exactly it’s like literally sticking many people rock hard place ZERO funding “bail outs”. 

Idk gofundme staring seem way go. Sad true...

And even worse, shouldn’t decide health children money... right?! 

What kind world live in?!

How broken system?

But also think unlikely would issue large scale vaccination effort something unsafe. Killing maiming significant portion population would ruin country/economy/defenses, etc... Oof. I'm virologist, me, coming close someone COVID appears dangerous immediately. CDC said 1,500 Americans day die month - 11,000 per week feel like numbers wrong, honest. way numbers going opening making masks distancing required everywhere. sorry hear this, u/Cantstandja24.

It's guy covering (hey - another fucking phrase TYPE lying. Huh, maybe one word phrase describe specifically?). He's actively attempting get something common obvious sense. That's makes gaslighting. (He = NCAA, school, whatever need here) Trump already blamed Obama covid. Tried reporting workplace health code violations? something illegal going there. Pretty sure Russia always stacked badass scientists. They're saying touches kids. get panicky sweat can’t catch breath. It’s truly miserable. anxiety related psychosomatic symptoms related pandemic.

These chronic fatigue pain, much less chronic fatigue pain experienced consistently *after* surviving bout virus. mean, they're already blaming Obama leaving test kits something exist presidency. using worldometers, always use 7 day running average due data reporting artifacts. might bit contradictory Stockholm crowded say (I mostly home outdoors parks live bit hard judge me), says something velocitiy spread taking off.

I think immunity young relevant groups keeping spread down. read region Stockholms latest report. maths arent completely hospitalized 5 persons last week less 50 hospital total 8 ICU. 

Something slowing spread significantly, sure aint crowds 4-5 people go shopping together beers outdoor seatings. Rick Dalton : right, that's hot. Anything heat?


Flamethrower Trainer : Rick, flamethrower. want provide study says something happen? actually provide study shows effectiveness?

I hope go digital learning. put quote Tegnell context. Tegnell FHM started back away openly admitting herd immunity strategy backlash UK. Previously, Tegnell particular effusively praised UK's herd immunity strategy said Sweden needs go: supervision first 5h day, parents would still there? would still leave 2pm. Vietnam originally ancestor strain China. globally dominant one European mutant, D614G, that's likely mean. two correlated mean they're same, disgusting worthless fear mongering tool

Why fuck feel need editorialize title provided ZERO articles title, provided ZERO quotes even supporting it? Either intelligence 3 standard deviations mean disgustingly dishonest; it? like heard less developed part town hit Cat 4 hurricane helicopters come rescue yet continue playing D&amp;D think people derseve lived better part town like you. never anyway hopeless poor.

I'm PA masks mandated public times. see countless people wearing every time go out. mandate needs enforcement. Yeah man it’s deadly pandemic, trying enlighten something don’t know already? sub full fear mongering doomsday scenarios, still. It’s nature social media really, engaging lots extreme anecdotes really scare SF rents definitely dropping city relatively cleared out, much enjoyment actually want live vs New Yorkers moved job hate city NYC reason refused leave now. Many Americans scratching heads thing. Rational discussion political issues try resolve differences seems exception rule “personally attack block opponent **win.**” terrible injustice. also way humans made many many terrible trying times past. parties put pork barrel riders pet projects bills try negotiate ones take instead real issues hand, making bills hundreds pages long one knows whats going on. Remember much smaller. illegals make jobs low paying. title edited labeled misleading. article highest drops rent were

The poster obviously trying spread political propaganda 'librul' cities warranted reality.

Why make headline Cleveland OH rents 16.0% Detroit MI rents 14.8%? Another Cleveland tourism video order.

The actual title article is

The submitter post banned least temporarily. wish could confident enough fellow US citizens say wrong. But, well... undiagnosed preexisting disorders Because, go back first point, testing cannot keep up. don’t infrastructure we’re exceeding supply reagent. Without fast, reliable testing can’t figure isolate time make difference.

Read here: don’t like Bill Gates trust me, people make argument. It’s terrifying amount people ignorant. facetious right? people actual modern day nazis though, exaggeration. honestly doubt testing capacity hit many cases. wash hands. Sanitize things touched hand touched outside home/comfort zone.
Don't fiddle mask outside. sanitize hands directly.

Sanitize first directly get home. exercise can. 

Eat drink free added sugar possible avoid starchy thing much possible. Lean red meat natural fats good you. Fruits berries good modération. like Trump even running president, though. American politics staunchly partisan insane since least Nixon. empirical evidence episode found doctor LSU British doctors compelling. might say environments lot controlled evidence homeless shelters. C19 study website ridiculous. count inconclusive studies negative. assumes RCTs observational studies. counts Boulware prophylactic study positive result, contradicting conclusions actual authors, b/c unpublished paper used sub-sample data ""prove"" HCQ works. site complete garbage designed solely consumption morons.

Dat ther intranets webs say 100% eeeeffctaeeve given eaerly! entertainment industry general completely fucked right now.

Each major studio sitting anywhere one several dozen completed films kicked road every week theaters back. Yeah, could sell VOD, movies cost +$200mil make--they're going make back VOD sales.

Not mention severely fucking future film production; slates scheduled *years* advance around specific dates (seriously--blocking film calendar math-heavy science days), meaning every time release dates get delayed basically everything gets pushed forward. worry big problem entertainment industry initial ""oh finally got see Tenet Mulan F9"" wears off; there's way audience tastes this, several years studios stick schedule every major movie feel ""off""--like time Wendy's incorporated long-dead memes advertising. think lot stuff might outright canceled, especially trend-riding films like lesser Marvel/DC movies (New Mutants never released standing that).

TV might *easier* go it, right networks fall slates production done midseason pickups spring half season. mentioned above, think audience tastes gonna complicate this, too; basically every show set ""real world"" address COVID going feel *off* audience, also see every show trying incorporate COVID storylines falling flat faces. Like, I'm already bored tropes COVID stories have. took miracle like hurricane make imperfect infection numbers go away. /s christian faith *always* idea world progressing towards end, things getting better. christians I’ve known always seem diametrically opposed towards unemployment, state outreach/safety net/benefits well, mainly know stop government helping folks, folks turn privately run charities, often Christian, thus, agony poverty masses people suddenly becomes opportunity brainwash folks gain converts fill coffers. 

The predicting end shit stuff though, fringe sect shit. tried explain someone like this: heart condition, get hit bus, cause death going ""hit bus."" fact heart condition may contributed death mean bus killed you.

If die hospital COVID positive, died COVID. Period. see stats Norway Denmark? can’t find them. 150,000 covid deaths America. 
Did know 647,000 Americans die heart disease year?

Where fear outrage heart disease?
And even brought cancer deaths year. Thank you! Good. would illegals didn’t undervalue them.

Even Cesar Chavez illegals. Yea, decided start using zoom notice. Yea, may oversight they’re dead now. Don’t think they’ll making mistake again. want agree I’m tired Twitter gif responses. speak diagnosed? listen now? public figure making public statement impacted personally I'm supposed reserve judgment?

If one-on-one conversation, would insensitive stance. not, plague people fail acknowledge problems impacts personally.  +1s Read completely. Roswell granted permit restaurant Canton St outdoor concert - read comments realize fucking stupid people be.  would fed regardless. time school, everyone brought food school. cafeteria. parents would always make food morning (mostly sandwiches) take school. 

Also, schools closed, parents would watched till 2:00pm go work, nothing would changed there. come studies long ago saying contact spreading actually really rare tough do?

From gather come think contact spreading possible much less common people think. think indoors people dangerous place that's major amounts airborne virus particles gather float around. think outdoors makes much safe wind air flows breaking concentration virus particles almost immediately, assume massive, nationwide BLM protests turn large hotspots (as far know). Also, months back city reopened beaches weeks supposedly traceable hotspots beaches, mostly indoor hotspots like gyms, restaurants, houses.

But China sending suited cleaners streets spraying every surface back February? Nothing makes sense. absolutely refuse believe China skyrocketed 80k cases got completely control back what, March April? believe that.

But again, know? OP, assume mean people refuse wear masks throw temper tantrums people call schools kids go fine dupe too. Much Russian people subject spewing info crap, much longer west. either believe bs, view see hear Russian media lies ignore it.

The thing propaganda affects everyone. Even intelligence services Russian leadership get mind-fucked spew disinformation, even knowing truth lies. part wallet shops, yes. part wallet depends sales taxes ad valorem taxes paid corporations reduce tax bill, much. yes, covid really accelerating existing trends. article:

Black Death 14th century, Jewish communities appeared dying fewer numbers Christian neighbours.

wait till hear rich people get sit home office outbreak expose like min wage workers. meet seen heard Democrat wear masks. Quit bullshit chilling sarcastic, people crowds even outside don’t appear. travel, eat, use restrooms, may even live other. Eventually big crowds people end indoors hot summer spread virus 🦠 simply getting slurpie. think doesn’t contribute masks always staying on, 100 percent naive 


You act like experts told wear mask April May well


I masks since February even got little dizzy store yesterday. worn gas masks Army , fit tested, whole 9 yards, almost passed out.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I've made huge mistake. Power BI typically slow shit like Underpowered BI think they'll mostly wearing masks, saying ok Sturgis rally they're mostly wearing masks? frustrating thing anyway people turned double standard saying protests spread Corona, large outdoor gatherings do. met seen someone mean exist... That's literally excuse many covid-conspiracy posters using. ""I know anyone corona virus. obviously fake news!""

Anyway, friend straight ticket dem refuses wear mask anywhere except work Popeyes. says makes hard breath, gets temperature checked work knows 😒. hand, negative would, perhaps,

low sensitivity tests fine... detect EARLY onset. false negatives likely high viral load... 

&amp;#x200B;

you get *infected* monday

it takes 24-48 hrs detectible 

Tue/Wed start feel it.

since getting tested every 48 hours (with results day).. 

you never 24 hours potential exposure others.

these good schools, office buildings, sports teams.. 

not people waiting lines testing centers sick days already.

.. add symptom screening extra safe.

&amp;#x200B;

in schools, etc - OK sending people home false positive - better safe sorry, right? need keep ***OUT***.. That’s thing US idea too. Like, Democratic Party managed convince whole world participate hoax, nominate moderate candidate wouldn’t use “hoax” really push Blue agenda?

Oh right, it’s hoax, stop posting fuckin memes fake Facebook sending them, mother. Hey random person. find got tetanus shot? older american. job interacting public daily basis, qualify. That's got disqualified. money. still paying taxes using public schools. dropped health precautions returned business, world would end.

The world ended Hermain Cain.

Notice, business owner, captain industry, guy investments connections ambition work ethic. responsible employment thousands people restaurants. going build businesses employ people? No, dead. 

Death disrupts business. ""The world would end"" really accurate. world know would fall apart people make work would die gone. stadium, indoor areas large openings outside. Smaller areas like bathrooms issue, saying short exposure cause it. bathroom visits short. Even busses commuter trains say major sources transmission. something simliar called ""whole-day-school"". went 5pm well. gave dinner homework you. Though almost parent send kid there. 

I assume kid time play kids outside value?  That’s crazy. disrespected teachers must feel. wouldn’t treat enemy way (I don’t think enemies?) close schools peak flu season? logic argument made.

Just COVID marginally lethal detract fact flu kills upwards 60-90k people year. Arrogance hubris.

The combination always leads human tragedy.

I wish ill-will upon attending, inevitable outcome flouting guidelines... sickness cases death. depends living situation. Coronavirus *not* necessarily spread every single corner living space. remember contact tracing studies, something like 50% chance infecting people house. That's bad, 100%. 


We really need using spare hotel capacity get sick people house. seem pretty angry someone care. Seems like one need hug.

*Hug* like everything, pros cons. definite advantages removing middle managers lot trade offs ready trouble what's rarest blood type, ab negative? Lol wonder lot Americans always like - giving fuck global tragedy/catastrophe? 

Imagine country comprised callous asshats WW2. Maybe .. knows much - point made thread. I've also said - - Florida past peak likely long way getting numbers 5 percent. Listen, said needs said. look like ass whether trolling not. aren't, shame you, sad little man hoping Karma real Reddit. Good luck. Eh, find Christianity infuriating. Bible interpretive document, yet everyone thinks interpretation correct. That's ended hundreds sects religion. Christian beliefs used justify wearing wearing mask, example. cannot correct, yet use ""The Bible"" ""explicit"" meaning foundation convictions. 

To me, bunch hogwash holds humanity back reaching full potential. Look thread topic, genius Well makes sense newest passion eating tubs ice cream crying 2:30 AM, thanks cows!! happened Jahovahs? Never see around anymore. Remember started dumping people next kin mass graves Staten Island? teach kids, natural consequences actions ""accident."". make bad choices end bad result, accident, mistake. bad judgment. parents hiring tutors aren’t directly taking money public schools. pay property tax still supporting school much before. schools lose funding declining ADA attendance numbers, essentially feds taking money them, feds could change rules school funding anytime momentum coming voting public.

The fact Redditors seem love acting like life ""all figured out"" everyone meanwhile practically life experience obligations outside college living home. many cases, parents choosing send kids school.

Where live, optional, remote learning. parents glad send kids school seem concerned. 

Many parents issuing death sentence they're clueless it. United States, people go names Karen Chad. *cough* Mexico *cough*. feeds other. people health literate they'd fuller picture type care they'd need entire lives, better knowledge things could suddenly pop up, etc. naturally leads higher interest ""how hell going pay this.""

Now, Shi broken silence details work. 15 July, emailed *Science* answers series written questions virus’ origin research institute. them, Shi hit back speculation virus leaked WIV. colleagues discovered virus late 2019, says, samples patients pneumonia unknown origin. “Before that, never contact studied virus, know existence,” Shi wrote.

“U.S. President Trump’s claim SARS-CoV-2 leaked institute totally contradicts facts,” added. “It jeopardizes affects academic work personal life. owes us apology.”

Shi stressed past 15 years, lab isolated grown culture three bat coronaviruses related one infected humans: agent causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), erupted 2003. 2000 bat coronaviruses lab detected, including one 96.2% identical SARS-CoV-2—which means shared common ancestor decades ago—are simply genetic sequences team extracted fecal samples oral anal swabs animals. also noted staff students lab recently tested SARS-CoV-2 everyone negative, challenging notion infected person group triggered pandemic.

Shi particularly chagrined 24 April decision U.S. National Institutes Health (NIH), made White House’s behest, [to ax grant EcoHealth Alliance New York included bat virus research WIV. “We don’t understand \[it\] feel absolutely absurd,” said.

Shi’s answers coordinated public information staffers Chinese Academy Sciences, WIV part, took 2 months prepare them. Evolutionary biologist Kristian Andersen Scripps Research says suspects Shi’s answers “carefully vetted” Chinese government. “But they’re logical, genuine, stick science one would expected world-class scientist one leading experts coronaviruses,” Andersen says. put robe wizard hat...

1. Protesters largely younger people often asymptomatic. infected person infects 1.3 people, would take couple months potentially cause outbreak. 
2. large crowds many people wearing masks close proximity *actually* caused infections, biggest breakthrough yet. reopen economy everything outside instead. Concerts, shows, sports could resume zero infections. 
3. illegal gathering 10 people reason **except** protest, thousands allowed congregate. sounds like political exemption, medical one. 
4. I’m protests, disagree gathering large groups global pandemic! Protest digitally social distancing least. 
5. infections beginning spiral control country. Instead united wearing masks social distancing, encouraged opposite behavior. 
6. protests (including reopening protests) immoral, sacrificing lives around preexisting conditions. consistent, either social distancing masks 100% essential everyone, *or aren’t*. neither? one other.

Aerosols *terrifying*. 

Honestly, understand took us long figure out, mean super-spreader events simply make sense droplets alone. Tell Trump people locked cannot mail ballots in.

He'll right away. also access academic tutors available general student population, outside problem scheduling class time, really dedicate hour two day studies probably squeeze lunch whatever.

The tutors can't homework *for* them, they'll get close get away with. think describing system outside America confused technology deliberately misleading public?

A lot back day called socker moms WASPs. ""total"" estimate. in, trying estimate number dead time said done, ie. there's vaccine people longer dying it. anywhere sight point. no, estimate higher reality. obvious then, even obvious now. 10 kids! chick needs get hobby. Provide source leave shitty jokes others. wonder he'll wear mask prison? Ehh, think Americans think Mexico Chile least far underdeveloped actually are. Certainly affluent US, I'd still say first world countries. average wages significantly global average, Chileans even earn Portuguese I've never seen anyone argue Portugal third world country.

Also Mexico Colombia countries listed densely populated US. consider continental US, Mexico densely populated. go visit eye doctor now.

After see psych probably one reasons virus hit hard south. grew NYC family gatherings like every 6 months special occasions. moved Virginia Beach VA 2012 seems many families gather like every single weekend. Southerners sure love gather family much. exchanged pack smokes. got car opened pack ate bugs. Went back showed clerk. exchnged opened pack front thing. three times tried diff brand. weeks since people warning outbreaks southern states would make NYC's outbreak look like cakewalk.

Well, today checked, even add Covid deaths Florida Texas, even get close. 

Hell, throw Louisiana deaths, still there. 

Toss Georgia juuuuust get equal New York City - even state. Oh lordy lord. U.S truly f*cked smells incredible, like cowboy lawyer! mom cancer compromised immune system. something like happened, guarantee lady getting ass knocked cold spot listen closely actually hear goalpost shifted reminds lady bought bunch pregnancy books return didnt need anymore. Didnt receipt, member could look card history. purchased 2 years ago. told couldnt return like ""oh ok"" walked out. decides co morbidity acceptable die? think one. Everyone wear mask please. come back this, California Germany seem roughly same.

I wonder grounds predictions happened. Covid magically go away mass vaccinations........it circulate less. Wait. Pier one still around?  He/she must thought - deposit check taking photo. cash :) article month old. spelled bullshit wrong. LOL wow... logic undeniable. 😒 Agreed, danger public safety. Anyone know anything happened woman coughed someone bagel shop Astoria, NY? googling follow wondering charged. Depends state city laws. morans. South Florida rich bitches assholes. much prediction. know damaging people's organs, know damaged organs tend fail, know organs fail people tend die. Herman Cain infected Tulsa Rally. Cases rising that.

Think it.

It's gonna get worse. stop line thinking children teens immune this.

Children teens working. 

They school, commute go store anything. whatever exposed parent likely careful.

*2 weeks later* Study shows children less likely people 20s 30s die. True, suppose seem cold hearted inconsiderate- however, would like know backstory, know isn’t available, went lives normally there’s pandemic thats i'm thinking. That’s good ringing decreased. hope goes away. research seems like Meniere's Disease matches description symptoms. wonder coronavirus causes it. Htf $800 bond biological attack terrorism? tell russia behind literally everything, lmao 

ah, remember called conspiracy theorists saying nefarious motives told us masks work, remember called conspiracy theorists said wet market story seemed implausible. gotta love ""conspiracy theorist"" become catch-all term people can't seriously debate. Wtf wrong people? Like it’s bad kinda behavior kinda people exist world go breeding producing offspring form similar habits behavior. scares more. Manager restaurant happens time. Usually say I’m sorry didn’t enjoy remade make something else try get pay something. looks better comp another item actually bought 0$ check.  happens teachers say tbey got covid think got exposed need sick leave quarantine? thinking outside box. would buy 2 weeks... I'd say better make sure good camera angle, get arrested punching woman face cough without ill-intent (that would story). Fauci said Coronavirus epidemics go ""waves"", that's influenza phenomenon. said scientists even understand influenza waves.

He said Coronavirus ""always on"" state, unlike flu. Wrong, statement transparently playing victim, actual justified victim completely normal families people right sad see reason Sounds like cheese tray  don’t believe charter schools held academic standard, though. It’s anecdotal, local high school closed, small town couldn’t stand send kids larger school county seat, got funding school become charter school. It’s around decade, dozens children pulled go larger school. Dozens may sound like lot, school fully open, classes around 30 students (I graduated class 28 1998). children started larger school, well behind children. sister’s niece one kids. switched schools eighth grade year, watched 46 movies (this say, may 46 times rather 46 movies - either way it’s excessive, especially math). Teachers don’t even need certified. Perhaps regulations state-to-state. can’t say.   mean even take covid-19 away, rude stretch imagination. fail see person felt justified coughing someone. year old  literally said think 10 million people covid NYC metro area. Yet scientist anytime saying anything like that. making shit up. Stop spreading misinformation Careful now, may cut edge.

And I'd hate declare bankruptcy due medical bills. everyone bloody hell go back “normal” accepting pre-COVID life over. Goddam vote next election make sure friends too. Players fine. They're investments.

The support staff? Expendable I've friends worked Target, K-Mart Walmart. shit deal returns absurd.  someone follow around store wearing mask two months ago. said anything them. mocking getting close saying, ""Oh, going aisle? go aisle? Oh going aisle now? Oh move?"" say word kept moving he'd get bored.

I crappy lungs thanks bad case pneumonia bronchitis kid bedridden like two months, chronic bronchitis adult. way knowing that, February literally go hospital bad episode bronchitis coughing hard kept throwing up. know could bad me.

People assholes reason all. harm someone either feel remorse/responsibility chalk to, ""How know cause *me*? sick anyway."" don’t realize many people arrested everyday profit criminal justice system. Lol thought funny. And???? level risk society able take order provide kids valuable education otherwise we'll sacrifice generation since virus us long time.
In areas virus important prevalent, combination precautionary measures (cohorting classes, reducing number kids per class, teaching outdoors much possible, isolating experiencing even mild symptoms, masking especially hallways, staggered schedules, etc.) high level testing + contact tracing acceptable resume class teaching. 98 you’ve earned right make big girl decisions own. woman may couple months life left anyway would want spend isolation? much freedom understanding people poor therefore unable pay bonds disproportionally impacted cash bonds. unable work for, let’s say week can’t pay bond, life thrown lot disarray. (Can’t pay rent, food family, get kicked out, kids one take care them, etc). someone money pay bond pay leave. 
And isn’t like bonds proportional based income, make HHI income level pay x% make fair. 
So that’s cash bond system seems unfair. disproportionally impacts poorer people more. 
My two cents! Ok, we’ve two teams thus far (Marlins Cardinals) half team tested positive. point throw towel?

As much I’ve missed baseball watch, much love watch again, think it’s time MLB admit season isn’t happening. long call ""time out!"" virus legally can't infect you. shortage guilt knowledge behavior killed Grandma. least heart disease cancer order magnitude. covid fraction killers America, quiet entire life.
But covid, think position assume moral high ground. 
You're hypocrite idiot. people waiting wings worse, everyone look back blame US letting happen. would not. solution changed. Shut down. Test trace. nothing effective. United States proof that. Member spouting ignorant comparisons flu using months old info? Yeah people credible worthy debate. simply contrarian troll running interference fat God. one cares say parrot. fun paying take care them.

Ha, US individual families left burden going medical bankruptcy. top don’t give fuck that. Looks like wrote code takes current trendline extends it. Bravo.

The huge swath boomers Gen-x would traditional style education.

Something else happened turn many across ages non-critical thinkers. Personally, think media consumption tied information overload. older people, raised news fair balanced required tell truth. brains never adapted modern infotainment wasteland.  could shout ""I feel threatened"" shoot her. Fast facts:

Deaths 50 since pandemic began - 2.

50-60 - 6.

60-70 - 18.

70-80 - 59.

80+ - 136.

Life expectancy Australia - 82.

Amount deaths stemming aged homes: 142/221. would hope come would back realizing we're armed fuck I'm playing around life death virus would almost inevitably also infect family live with. hope nobody gets shot think deserve anything good curbstomp matter time try cough someone carrying also immunocompromised get popped. Doctors dealing better disease first months. Low level demons extreme Karenness, lower level Karens they're still Karens. need restrict using word.

To virus thing. virus give sh\*\*\* intentions. Outdoor gatherings masks fine. Naah, doomers wanted see 100 000 new cases now. Kinda hard even know belonged you. thoughts well. coronavirus statistically concern types individuals, they’re immunized pandemic effectively over. Period.  simple. whole herd immunity means ones cannot take vaccine protected. someone health issues preventing able take vaccine means they’re left vulnerable. idiots won’t take vaccines put ones can’t take vaccine risk. late now. done across entire country (and seriously) March, we'd much better situation.

Plus fuckton people participating protests one day.

Protests go one day either.

Those going 2 months involve millions people.

What bunch fuckin hypocrites. Good need spam social media emails.. innocent people’s lives risk here. people going work grocery shopping living everyday life spreading attending gatherings MIL ER nurse states, state completely shut liquor sales, said hospital run people severe withdrawal first week two pandemic. It’s crazy. House is, Senate Republicans It’s fine. God protect them. make new offering every time many people get hired. affect test results released today, mess results week two come he’s Trump? Calm surely less people end it. reddit phds told deaths down? using fax machine, probably sending medical documentation. That’s one things people need fax, days.

And nobody else could her? Somebody surely started gofundme much friends something. 

She home anyway  wanted say thanks others brave dedicated enough volunteer testing -- means great deal, grateful. way December.. imagine. hope. 11862 lobbyists United States. 150 lb 35% muscle mass could expect about... 156,000 lobbyist burgers. enough got go deeper. Yeah messed Obama huh Learn live It. virus never go away. 99.5% survival rate. affects old immunocompromised. Take necessary precautions, account idiots. Let businesses open. We’re worst economic depression time. Let’s get back work Well 8-9 month places little immunity, far place proven useful immunity. (As far know highest measured far new York 20% good 20% anywhere near enough helpful 80). also comment section every link local news station posts, accusing posting liberal fake news. Haha Ok. Yeah point. Easy fix widespread tutorials.

For example, Finland, Yle published [ELI5 instructions wear Oh totally. fault own.

Edit: sarcasm. legitimately shitty situation.  Ahh PETA.... wonder. good Trump. Given comment I'm led believe know ""OSHA certified"" means. 

Nothing. OSHA certification workers. people usually mean say they're ""certified"" completed 10- 30-hour training course OSHA authorized trainer issued Department Labor card saying completed specific course industry. maintain card usually need compete one two courses year. know taught, taught necessary keep safe job site. 

Who think comes/came material occupational safety? figured dangerous scenarios best way prevent accidents? Engineers came machinery safety, sure, comes things like determining risk exposure different chemicals protect yourself? came Chemists Epidemiologists Doctors/Nurses scientists.

In contrast, every single listing I've seen entry-level Epidemiologist requires minimum Master's degree relevant area study (i.e., epidemiology, environmental health, environmental science, occupational safety health, etc.) one year research. doctorate preferred. medical degree combination either two degrees really makes strong applicant. Again, entry level research position. people recommending masks entry level, years education experience, recommendations determined single individual groups experts looked evidence related masking, spread COVID-19, possible benefits dangers, arrived consensus masking would help reduce community spread. 

Has person read studies masks? what's written answer resounding ""No"". Go National Library Medicine read research, larger studies, literature reviews, case reports, every single one arrives conclusion: community masking helps reduce community spread included package interventions pandemic response. Masking panacea, alone end pandemic, component overall response. 

All claims ""dangers"" masking unfounded. risk skin irritation (especially wear long periods time bought shady seller), wash mask using hours time close proximity people increase risk contracting virus; outer material full aerosol particles either going breathe touch mask transfer virus eyes point every resulting infection. keep spare spares change every hours. 

So, no, guy know he's talking took 30 hour course workplace safety. still YouTube channel, videos (based read) anti-mask talk virus hoax, still YT? Aren’t supposed take down? deplatformed. Maybe stack vents border finish Wall! antibody tests likely miss mild cases, antibodies go away while. I've seen seems quite common antibodies decrease enough test negative couple months. “fiscal responsibility” ass personally think internet. social media. Im probably gonna shoot someone next time hear ""..but youtube video saw..."" quote fauci scientist. Slowpoke fucking mascot. lowest GDP decline world

That sounds suspect. go bears! :) incorrect. headline fair summary comments, right wrong though may be. makes distinction among countries whether consider locking again, tell. lot Danes going Sweden go fitness centres instance. closed here.

I know several people went Sweden fun period Denmark blocked entrance Sweden. Fire Nation? 6 week old fetuses!! live rural county TN schools going re-open August 11 staggered schedule. Section go school Monday Tuesday, Section B go school Thursday Friday. Wednesday teacher in- service day. last week back school/prayer meeting 5k walk/run. Parent/teacher meetings early September regular schedule starts Sept. 9. schools offer distance learning 1/3 students accepted. main problem distance learning many students live far town limited internet.

I homeschooling son years due health. thankful already anxious everyone else's kids. Covid 19 rates going explode. bad already going get worse. winter going bad. Yeah definitely still mask up, sanitize maintain good practices (people around wouldn’t necessarily know circumstance want people around feel safe)— yeah sort weird knowing there’s good chance I’m immune. Let’s hope antibodies last! Man. Definitely heard similar stories. I'd say it. I'm glad hear guys made thick storm though. mental fog like hold head thoughts. can't think, focus wanna anything. feel tired mentally, wanna bothered either. Trying describe best Lets forget 10 billion dollar wall. He’s talking Oxford vaccine though. Quick everybody rush mountains I'm worried going gradually lead war involving China. far biggest responsible party go mess. enough unrest due unemployment, think could used catalyst war. least helping breaking moment information age itself.

That is, disconnect reason initial outbreak, sole reason outbreak spread far incompetent government is. instance childish notion perhaps supply respirators everyone enforce (through whatever means necessary) use. time considered silly. wonder would worked better. virus would already mostly stamped now. cares says anyway? can't trusted. They're China's back pocket. Indeed good sir. Indeed “Do want charred monkey hands go hot dogs?” U mean 1918 yes think possibility could've bad Spanish flu measures taken place good medical science techniques. no, totally different. They're rich. Definitely. hope works mostly ya know shits fucked.

But secondly country made joke past years. would nice prove we're has-been country. feel like work would lend us credibility nation give us something worth proud instead 'lol got fishin back'. Tool pretty excellent, posting lyrics discussion like nothing like r/im14andthisisdeep material. Bunch friends caught it. said felt like bad cold. recovered now. ages 30-40ish. singing, lip-syncing pre-recorded track. also get close enough guests spread anything. Combine fact guests MUST wear masks risk close nil possible. believe handlers (like cast members leading Merida's horse Gaston's horse) masked well. believe cast members stripes get tested going ""on-stage"". They’ll killing people too. whole exponential spread thing.  ""The internet making people fucking stupid.""

Ronny Chieng. Actually does... PA, deaths people people &lt;45. arent many people PA let alone US. told let open schools? Come Alabama..... absolutely immunity? sure one? full article case anyone Podcasts? Expert alert. didn’t. I’m saying Interesting thing thought I’d share you. went take COVID test last week, signed papers waited line. waiting 45 minutes decided leave come back another time. Oddly enough got call yesterday doctor saying tested positive COVID. Never took test tested positive? Wonder many “slip ups” virus caused many. Saw another guy exact thing happen him. Makes wonder accurate numbers are. understand testing every available sample point sewage every day everywhere world. absolute easiest way pool samples, assess prevalence, adjust local policy suppress minimal impact. follow science, effective vaccine coronaviruses, even common cold. makes think one Covid 19? Assuming vaccine cause harm, risk resume ""normal"" behavior realize vaccine work get sick. work pfizer team testing vaccine...we better antibody titers, smaller dose, better around results, cheaper...Moderna AZ suck pathetic attempt (also accepting government funding) parents live Tennessee heartbreaking.

They early 70s thankfully believe dangers virus stay home. in-laws also live unfortunately they're starting go more, without masks, father law caught ""the China hoax"". ""The discrepancy official figures number deaths records also matches difference official figure calculations excess mortality mid-June.""

Do know mean? means Iran government found deaths caused coronavirus, can't done developed countries big gap death toll excess mortality. 

If believe true, admit Iran competent government world. 

Do really think Iran government competent world? absolutely not. believe capabilities find deaths? Remember swine flu pandemic? got vaccinated January 2010 pandemic declared August 2010. mean best trained use masks often face covering depending enviroment Got fam What, ordering Amazon forgot check shipping date? Umm, actually read want get paid, playing. 

## Abstract

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak North, Central, South America become epicenter current pandemic. suggested previously infection rate virus might lower people living high altitude (over 2,500 m) compared lowlands. Based data official sources, performed new epidemiological analysis development pandemic 23 countries American continent May 23, 2020. results confirm previous finding, showing incidence COVID-19 American continent decreases significantly starting 1,000 sea level (masl). Moreover, epidemiological modeling indicates virus transmission rate capacity lower highlands masl) lowlands (&lt;1,000 masl). Finally, evaluating differences recovery percentage patients, death-to-case ratio, theoretical fraction undiagnosed cases, found severity COVID-19 also decreased 1,000 m. conclude impact COVID-19 decreases significantly altitude. Whats FHM?

Maybe vagueness resulted different reasons spread around. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  ...and there's going people screaming they're going get vaccinated *he* said plot saw internet/heard talk radio/Trump says so..

for rest us back reality, good news however. Soon. Soon. Last time visited, saw several people wearing pro-Mussolini t-shirts. Fascism didn’t work well guy. brightest people. Lmao still waiting meet doctor hospital said willing get vaccine novel virus. really know decade lot this. protect (and others) accepting fact, assuming worst, acting accordingly. worry keeping score. Worry keeping healthy. 1G causes spanish flu. Rockefeller wants control us vaccinations Damn, got Corona! didnt said govt. said that. Swedes told that, assumed reason Swedes saying like commonly accepted reason Sweden.

Swedes posting analyses credit carf use Sweden r/europe argue Swedish policy. We've reached counting bodies phase this. took Amtrak Austin San Antonio once. trumpy.  That's 1 way get Alabama map, 🤞 far people getting heart inflammation, lung damage, micro clots throughout organs, mini strokes associated cognitive decline.

But that's virus. ""If happens all."" Lol.  know. reason even done b/c getting surgery (on ankle) scott &amp; white required test beforehand. got one came back negative (which knew would literally come contact anyone several months prior virus...except going hospital consultation ankle first place) ...then surgery postponed days needed get another test day beforehand.  .... know type (i even realize 2) loss smell number #1 post Covid issue. None true.

What true FHM vague possible strategies, clearly vague corresponding agency Norway.  Governor DeFloridaMantis  drives nuts important step reopening right pushing hard for. can't people understand something common good makes us better off? ""Science stand way"" schools reopening -- White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany hole poked arm, fluid injected muscle. That's basically bruise I'll play devil's advocate here. pics article, looks like people wearing masks. back, article regarding CDC director stating America could virus control 8 weeks everyone wore mask. me, says even big crowded areas, spread could minimized everyone followed simple instructions - seems like people there.

This still absolutely good situation considering crowds, stands, everyone wearing mask, spread minimized. Fauci owns moderna stock social distanced hanging out? Back coronavirus yet, got pretty overworked decided I'd quit teaching June, did; I'm feeling regrets now. Although I'll probably keep streaming lectures youtube students left, even I'm getting paid anymore. would nice would wear ""do hospitalize"" bracelet fee like point game, vaccine would safer getting covid. still feel like ass 45 days first symptoms... could’ve prevented getting shot, would’ve first line. I'm sorry. Maybe impress need wear mask least? There's new evidence wearing mask protect you. debate quickly schools go back person classes start churning cases spread community. Instead planning predictable outcome, leadership going resort thoughts, prayers, hopes things work peachy.  Seriously. Maybe dude buying vacation home. reasons sell shares beyond market speculation. mean think expected since news vaccine started coming out, we’ve known awhile medical staff high risk people first get it, makes sense many quarantining houses aren’t really anything risks, you’re able vaccinate first, it’ll greatly lower number deaths Temps higher 90C damage fibers mask negatively affect filtering efficiency. Temp also depends material mask made of, check MSDS composition research temperatures affect materials. 100% safe, least gives idea temps. almost 100% Mitch’s doing. We're likely dispute ""high risk"" means, too. 10 year old congenital heart defect. pediatric cardiologist idea makes higher risk average kid age, insufficient data (it's rare condition). me, assume he's high risk, I'll problem categorical decision kids lower priority vaccinate. Maybe said Fauci counting federal government actually follow advice massive shitstains worse nothing death hundreds thousands Americans. raising Cain award? Considering married couples failed pass would say little worry about. Early discuss extent restrictions would legal. example, Finland closed region country discussed e.g. Tegnell would possible. possibility Sweden close area, legal people come agreement Sweden could legally used small area, particular school so. Everyone *should* living fear. else get this? mentality need everyone pandemic estimation. margin error breaking nonsense. 1300 kids died covid, dumb ass. California reported first child death. 

Show proof...other mathematical, nonsensical bug states 0 1300 children died..

I'm pretty sure cdc saying 20. 1300. start bragging decrease positives closing testing stations

Oh they’ll *definitely* Texas 0 cases! 




But reporting system down. I’m sure realize post completely useless considering could’ve gotten placebo. even sure typed it. Fuck leaders America. trash. sides complete utter trash. Remindme! ten years voters enough impeach yet? mean wtf. held accountable current future deaths. Oh wow, thanks sharing agreed casual weight lifters.  definitely appreciate wanting better shape there's crowd that's dad brave noble man selflessly giving need kidney. proud him.

I mean he’s dumb box rocks. Sounds like deal. take bitcoin? social circle big means, pretty decent number factor people work plus ""once removed"" connections - example, close friend close friend got it, would hear that. heard yet.  wats going covid today? good news? ""I tolllld would go away, right along, fixed this, where's medal?"" cdc inflating numbers doctors diagnosing deaths covid deaths get government funding that's given one (in hospitals) Anti fun I’d describe it. Drinking brings terrible behaviors, it’s totally inappropriate parks. night, leads fights, graffiti, vandalism, loud parties, neighborhood disturbances. Drinking limited bars good reasons.  Tell church house sick. None allowed taken hospitals.

Let God deal them. mask shortage HK except right beginning epidemic, everyone world scrambling get top first wave. government even provided reusable filter masks public free later on. It’s crazy, isn’t it? Herman Cain die from, Dems giving bad juju? Art steal /u/hawkeye_again010101 , previously posted /r/NoNewNormal 

I OSHA 10&amp;30 certified. know too. don’t really know OSHA hasn’t come forward stopped nonsense want cover 3 things

• N95 masks masks exhale ports

• surgical masks

• filter cloth masks

Okay, upon inspection, OSHA says masks okay okay certain situations.
If you’re working fumes aerosol chemicals give employees wrong masks get sick, sued.

• N95 masks: designed CONTAMINATED environments. means exhale N95 design exhaling contamination. exhale N95 masks vented breath straight without filtration. don’t filter air way out. don’t need to.

Conclusion: you’re Target guy Covid N95 mask, covid breath unfiltered exhaled Target (because designed already contaminated environments, it’s filtering air way out).

• Surgical Mask: masks designed approved STERILE environments. amount particles contaminants outside indoor environments people CLOGGING masks very, quickly. moisture breath combined clogged mask render “useless” come contact Covid mask traps it, become walking virus dispenser. Everytime put mask breathing germs EVERYWHERE went. changed thrown every “20-30 minutes non sterile environment.”

• Cloth masks: can’t even believe I’m explain this, goes. Today, three people pointed masks walked entering Lowe’s. said “ya gotta wear mask BRO” said clearly “those masks don’t work bro, fact MAKE sicker” “pshh’d” me. hopefully know CLOTH masks filter anything. mean American flag one aunt made? Yes. one sunflowers looks cute? Yes. bandanna, cut t-shirt, scarf offer FILTERING whatsoever. exhale, ridding lungs contaminants carbon dioxide. Cloth masks trap carbon dioxide best. actually risks health, rather protect it. moisture caught masks become mildew ridden night. Dry coughing, enhanced allergies, sore throat symptoms micro-mold mask.

-Ultimate Answer:

*N95 blows virus air contaminated person.

*The surgical mask designed outside world filter virus upon inhaling it. It’s filtration works exhale, (Like vacuum bag, works one way) likely stops 20 minutes, rendering useless outside STERILE ENVIRONMENT (correct Karen, don’t work bar, even little bit).

*Cloth masks WORSE none. It’s equivalent using chain link fence stop mosquitos.

The CDC wants us keep wearing masks. masks don’t work. They’re used provide false comfort push forward specific agenda. love God, research mask’s designed use purpose, bet find NONE used way “viral defense.”

Just like EVERY Flu season kids, wash hands. Sanitize hands. Don’t touch stuff. Sanitize phone. Don’t touch people. keep distance. Why? breath stinks, deodorant failing, shoes old stink, shirts clean, &amp; like space. Trust hear here. Lots reasons keep distance work body hygiene. trust me, masks work.

*Occupational Safety &amp; Hazard Association sited.

The top American organization safety.

They regulate educate asbestos workers, surgical rooms, name it.

I know, facts suck. throw wrench perfectly (seeming) packaged pill willingly swallowing. 

Facts make form OPINION, instead regurgitating someone else’s, know uncomfortable makes lot you. mask gives security, means wear it. know false sense security shouldn’t shame anyone partaking “conspiracies.”

If select politicians stopped enforcing it, one would continue nonsense. Don’t drink kool-aid. every local transit organization's responsibility put requirement freedom slowly remove deemed safe. 

Last time checked, Airlines part local transit. Neither Amtrack Greyhound. Local transit authority would power metro/state transit. fact none old motherfuckers dropped dead Covid one reasons makes suspicious virility. *sigh*  molten silver deluted aqua regia? i’m sorry wtf alabama doing? What?

Your concerns unfounded. order whatever wants. one would listen order, within authority.

How going enforce order anyway? Send federal troops every polling station country arrest people try vote masks on? Yes, importantly, modulates.

Oh yeah propagated outbreak compared thousands month+ protesting.

Its like democrats specialize failed arguments remember vaccine, remember one, arm hurting badly like 3 days. oof Care provide demonstrable proof claim made!? comment really brings back February Okay let's say vaccine researcher sample COVID virus. goal study use genetically engineer inactive version immune system recognize adapt to. 

Antibodies incredibly precise virus-seeking missiles, immune system program antibodies target virus, specifically, spiky proteins sticking I'm sure seen COVID graphics. developing vaccine, first step would extract genetic material, isolate part makes spiky protein, jam E. coli DNA trick bacteria mass producing spiky protein. inject vaccine live subject expose COVID see immune system make antibodies recognize live virus. takes design protocol works specifically one virus well studied past.

If vaccine fails point, presumably will, there's million one different minor major ways improve it. tweak genetic code spiky protein, maybe stick polyethylene glycol molecules whatever vaccine goes right part body, etc etc. part takes time development stage. 

Then make working vaccine get human trials, inject healthy people vaccine see happens. good, inject moderately healthy people, elderly otherwise unhealthy. good point, gets approved. wanted NZ style, non essential workers would stay home Religious Services cancelled. Maybe 6 weeks, sadly. Yeah, like flu, something kill make seriously ill, really major concern vaccine. 
The problem much illness fact new yet know treat absolutely immunity. I’m getting really tired goddamn organization. come like two weeks ago saying won’t return old normal bad is, they’re coming lockdowns.

What fuck then? Tell us keep straight message enough fear mongering one day, upbeat next bullshit. know right Yesterday today France Spain report anything... there's that. Germany 380 cases 400 1000 days before... maybe I'm paranoid fear end like spanish flu report something winter. legislation place handle outbreaks infectious people's quarantine (lack freedom movement). However, justification lock entire country (and large country area, huge variability population density regions) cases one region. little justification lock someone quarantine sick suspected sick either. grandmother wanted come stay months summer TN, can’t sit house day.

When tried explaining lockdown didn’t want risk it, said doesn’t wear mask hasn’t caught death’s falsely filed COVID.

She also called democrat virus, constantly says it’s Flu. Nobody going socially distance years Probably long last time actually practiced critical thinking lol. Explain exactly think Fauci currently incorrect expect to. Pandemics end day there's vaccine, process. disgusting headline Telegraph. Here's quotation doctor used article: ""we're hopeful countries need implement national lockdowns again"". 

She arguing lockdown necessary uncontrolled spread going forwards, places spread controlled, countries lock locally -- like Canada outbreak Toronto need shut country even entire province, even city region needs lockdown.

She warning lockdowns. even warning NATIONAL lockdowns. simply saying places able localize lockdowns impact affected areas. mail ballots tracking? know ever counted?

Some states do. California even lets opt-in receive text/email/phone updates ballot's progress.

But trust mail, always turn ballot county's election office. I'm pretty sure every state mail-in voting allows that. states also dropboxes. antibody thing, herd immunity on-off thing. think clearly true never plan reach full herd immunity, specifically since unclear even means disease. since got large spread clearly wanted promote resulting immunity (and know illness results immunity, know early on). indeed silly people otherwise always talk scientifically proven case consistently use weasel words turn things specific direction.

I saw masks recommended mass transit Denmark. Sweden Tegnell actually last week first time, knowledge, admitted might start recommend masks certain environments, spread starts increase again. thought positive.

Let's skip mask wearing streets countries have, pretty stupid. let's use shops mass transit. makes lot sense. really going studied US.  We're simply testing enough populations public health system poor, know vitamin levels either control group tested population.

Bro, wife actual frontline doctor who’s treating CoVID19 since March. We’ve living real reality since shutdown, back government telling docs wear bandana ran masks. 

You got 1,200 per person, spent far N95’s, faceshields, intubation fear, surgical gowns.

I spent hundreds hours pleading local elected officials community take whole thing seriously worked home kids nearby wife worked 80-100 hour weeks trying fix broken bodies didn’t need broken.

And people say? It’s hoax, affects frail, doctors lying money, masks don’t work. politicians don’t care hospitals running full speed four months can’t keep up, denial issue all.

I don’t want people die senseless illness, wish everyone would properly wear well made masks, act responsibly, keep distancing, that’s happening I’m ready velocity hit roof let unmasked idiots meet fate.


Someone warn treatment options much rationed though, options effective. Dr. Li Meng Yan (whistle blower HK) say safe dosage HCQ used prevention could cure early stage Covid19? Always wondered arm. delts always sore that. wish could ventroglute Back donated platelets regular, three nurses clinic could reliably stick (one tube arm). tried time visits around schedule.

Most nurses would either go vein trouble getting needle vein. (Resulting waste platelet kit.) $1200 per person regular people around $25000 person corporations. someone else put pumped $3 trillion taxpayer money billionaires made money disappear stock market.

The solution everything! 

/s Technically drown longer homosexual. There's FAR urgency end pandemic, though. see vaccination rollouts occurring much faster pandemic. That’s really awesome you’re one trials! Glad far side effects / soreness short lived. I’ve gotten flu test would imagine swab nose would as, more, uncomfortable vaccine. *screeches freedom* Coronavirus symptomless kill you, symptoms vary wildly person person. Even children teenagers die it.

A better reason get vaccine catch virus might transmit parents grandparents, would much harmful them. don’t know this. higher elevation Utah 10% positivity rate right now. none rest either😉 Peak 15th August based trends. two weeks increases. Even could longer high positive rate. Anyone know brand wi-fi extender is?  Republicans last! Rofl. Hard deal reality see amiright isolating completely necessary though, matter ""unrealistic"" think is.

Public health inconvenience. agree. know fauci keeps saying next year we're gonna seriously ramp timeline Thanksgiving united states going havs SERIOUS problems. hospital data... hear enough BS Q friends don’t need hear conspiracy crap too.. ""back work"" mostly means finding new job thats likely pays less worse conditions used do, too. easy people say ""go back work"" still job privilege working home ""in coming months""

I relieved yet.

Although like idea testing flu well. Thats smart. Going game, much. long vaccine last body? going yearly shot? Like flu shot? life! Praise God! went Orlando theme parks crowded lines mad short Going strip club casino infecting players/staff/the general public asked use brains also seems distasteful. long.

Get see world, go see Japan, Germany, China see far behind USA people attitudes like yours. good article repost trust Fauci? saying would unsafe take due lack safety measures. It’s blatant mockery point. Probably exact opposite I'm test trial one vaccine trials. structured know sure whether got vaccine placebo, report soreness gone within 48 hours injection. pretty significant first day after, faded quickly. side effects (well, yet, still one treatment). perfectly honest, test huge cotton swab impactful injection side effects. small world, all!  Yeah, bit worse others, people respond differently different vaccines, definitely couple got vacciness highschool, they'd administer us specifically non dominant hand, since knew us would feel rest day. Except positive Covid test. Asymptomatic people experiencing heart scarring well, really don’t understand thing. Let guess - another ""this hoax worse flu masks hurt freedoms"" guy, right? LEOPARDS!!

Your mom gets new shirt paint supposed slide right shirt get stained. wear shirt every day, waiting finger painting day test well shirt works.

Well, vaccine testing give kids really cool new shirts, give kids old shirts look same. Usually, wait finger painting day kindergarten, see new shirts cleaner old shirts.

Right now, finger painting day every day every class, wait it. see really quickly new shirts stay cleaner old shirts. restrictions relaxed allowing companies make it, products still violate regulations, FDA forcing recall products. pointless post. Ikr. Nearly every ""prediction"" since beginning complete joke. Hell, still remember telling us million people gonna die August. Paying attention arbitrary predictions pointless I'm church gatherings. everyone wishing ill upon churchgoers believing actions reckless also willing condemn protests going 50+ days? Wrong. thinking hospitalizations thats controlled HHS. also zero evidence doctoring data nationwide. students far likely die influenza. 150k covid deaths usa, 50 children 5 18. means they're idiots hesitate murder scores children families. Now, government agency power people could force safer option... 


Aw, shit. Pederson isnt athlete. He's coach. there's evidence sick symptomatic. 52, asymptomatic feeling fine, according source. I'm foreigner confused second thought something animal bats. say often. ""Sometimes forget average person bright fully half people even worse off."" feel like guys defiant mask order, simple, wonder corners cutting actual health standards North Carolina. This. People sub regurgitate garbage articles already posted multiple times act like groundbreaking.

Reminds ""we landed moon"" scene Dumb Dumber. Oh shit. Lol  Thank this. definitely learned something new! Nixon

Wait wut? republican president supported idea. cant get head around this. drinking good immune system anyway would even try stop how? federal government cheering people on, state governments shoulders like ""ehh, wear mask social distance guess?"" local communities desperate revenue. they'll go store, bars restaurants, they'll fill hospital hallways expose healthcare workers.

And can't fucking read ten commandments. almost like crony favoritism profiteers help public.  Idk yall understanding get vaccinated, that's safest ever (even 100%). I've barely even left house since March, literally average every weeks necessities, I'm taking super seriously. get vaccinated that's safest I'll ever be, I'll 100% done bs living life like normal. Idgaf herd immunity, others wanna get vaccinated like dont wanna social distance wear mask now, thats problem. fact hope demand vaccine low beginning manage get one.  Religion poisons everything say something blm protests anti lockdown protests, say stupid idea then. I've saying FL trending everyone gets mad pointed out. feel complaints school reopenings valid cause
1. least around Ontario masks mandated lot easier workers socially distance there.
2. They're allowing elementary schools reopen full time closed environment virus spread within time.
3. lot classrooms really small it'll hard schools prepare ways elementary students socially distance short amount space within short time since Doug leece even release plans recently.
4. We're talking kids here. They're known spreading viruses going less likely stay hygienic times. 8 year old nephew would consistently nasty things spread virus picking nose touching face etc.

I would say correct that. government's records appear show almost 42,000 people died Covid-19 symptoms 20 July, versus 14,405 reported health ministry.  number people known infected also almost double official figures: 451,024 opposed 278,827.

Deaths unreported 2.92x cases 1.62x.

Edit: data includes names people died survived, including names people known BBC. BBC believes verifies leaked data genuine.

The data includes.. details daily admissions hospitals across Iran, including names, age, gender, symptoms, date length periods spent hospital, underlying conditions patients might have. Although 45% seems staggering, kind good news attribute due needed sedation ventilator.

A different aspect (not article) recently learned COVID patients ability smell resurfaces. Weeks weeks everything smelling like ammonia cells regenerate fully able transmit signals properly. 

At least, progress (hopefully most) well again. *Cuomo quarantine policy*

American travels Florida New York: 14 days!

American travels Florida Cancun India (places high transmission), spends days beach visiting family Delhi, travels New York: quarantine!

What absurd policy! Damn never thought that. damn bone spurs again. Florida wants. 

Why?

Because Trump want look bad. Yet, infected dead come make look worse. also ones actually paying vaccine yeah...they first dibs that's case, something wrong article, article claims white house wanting make bill ""such decisions left states, local governments, transportation systems, public health leaders"". locals authority so, could use reason. =/ guess think might make sense some. Nothing Atlanta, try head least populated area can. Better room rates way. Many previously healthy people get Covid suffer serious long lasting debilitating side effects. It’s deaths. convenient. really cruise, regular line carries passengers goods year. said, lot people take several day trip ""Hurtigruten"" summer holiday, due wonderful sights along way. then! look crowed.

Covid-9/11 basically lot teachers get sick something. Fauci! Damn.... education system really educate anymore. 

'Increasing 1000 1001.
'Spiking': 7 days increasing number cases 1000 1007. 

See, cases spiking increasing, sound alarm world ending. 

Vague imprecise terms scare dimwitted plebs. I'm getting sick well along dumbasses wearing masks chin straps following guidelines coughing, I've become especially tuned hear

I really believe fits second bit us afford rental properties Florida. Great that's cool wishing death others. we're fighting first place smell kook cooking? Russia weeks actually irks smoke anywhere Ontario except Pearson. Even designated smoking areas cannot smoke cannabis. Blows mind. YVR one seen far allow both. Makes sense. also means 2 substitute teachers needed roughly 2 weeks Got blood taken days ago older lady must've mentally done everything day. Shit hurt brused like week. add crowd specifically large portion anti maskers ride motorcycles hundreds miles attend. disaster It’s one hour every morning 21 straight days. church 60,000 members statewide even small percentage take part catastrophic state Joseph Smith! majority people, yes. got chills flu vaccine decade ago. Muscle pain injection site dime dozen know helps? **GOLFING** It’s good cause. protests go fundamental issues social order US. protests reason constitutional rights free speech assembly.

This motorcycle rally allowed continue monetary reasons. aren’t equivalent. town Kentucky, symptoms, go convenient care pay $60 test. fever weeks ago doctor test/send test/whatever cough shortness breath. go airport today pickup someone saw many people inside either wearing masks wearing masks noses sticking out. see people full face shields tho.  exact demographic needs thinning course problem now, February shortage really cause so. toughest days searched half district still find mask, (yes all) masks time given friends parents' friends. would regard getting mask time pure luck. point time, now. Maybe among lucky ones (or doctors/nurses/their family members easier you)? Give baby !!! NBA bubble entirely Orlando, Florida, USA.

The team Toronto, even Canada letting baseball play there. He’s guilty that, don’t melodramatic edgy. sick tired hearing phrase ""new normal"". Fast food retail don’t want hire college grads.

They’re worried college grad “fancy” job, they’ll leave second they’ll find something better. need tell hospitals invention devil, relying secular medicine like spitting God’s eye. power prayer, isolated among like-minded people, need. die, obviously either God’s will, didn’t pray hard enough tithe enough. Stupidly time travel! Reminds old bit Daily Show mocked ""Now Casting"" aka TV hosts getting paid shit load money making segments predicting what's going happen, predicted going right now.

Example 

""I predict people able pay rent"" Right, like Unabomber. used deport Italian mobsters. costs lot house people 50 years so.  come oil pans collect leaking fluids? Hey, long *feel* like *protesting* without masks harmless. may sound insensitive hope anywhere near Wentz. man fragile, want see completely healthy. class '08. think class '20 way tougher. least still gigs could generate income, things shut down. Class '20 literally nothing.  fuck nudnicks even much free time? wear seatbelt? so, why? smoke grocery shopping, no? not??? you’re going idiot, least consistent idiot. Employers absolutely give bonuses,hazard pay, etc. companies now, like Lowes. government need involved. I've saying happen, thought would take longer.

I think trace today's managers (and ideas) factory foremen, make sure people work. people worked got promoted, looked job way. shit transmitted one generation other, even business changed.

That's still ton middle managers WFH, can't evaluate people's work otherwise. know look time people get work, equate early work good worker, look much time people spend working (or pretending work). 

And mentality dropped. plenty tools help evaluate people's productivity. Time spent front desk/workstation worst. 

And big companies need people watch people work. probably well fewer managers managing larger pools workers. mention hvac hvac important factor making indoors safe.

They need cycle full air room fresh air least 3 times hour. masks needs required times, even class.

A study effects hvac preventing causing spread published early last year. school opening without addressing hvac 100% unsafe. acceptable number deaths zero. Bomers Except small part that. Otherwise wouldn’t dumb people getting rhino’s horns. Cupping also bullshit, on. Using plants herbs base modern medicine, Chinese. rest world matter Cull trump voters top that, people issues sedentary people poor diets. They're super fit people eat well.

It's also less year. We're still sure long-term effects be. clear, idea viruses like SARS-CoV-1, I'm confident enough extrapolations willingly risk getting something may get blanket ""pre-existing condition"" Southern states plus California

The rise cases practically nationwide, Small brains short circuit ignore immediate threat. It’s hot handle. 

Cognitive Dissonance 

I wonder would happen people transported back Europe WW2. Would keep partying bombs dropping ? think it, shirts probably already there. It’s like slow motion Jonestown. Last rally went pretty well seniors fest. Bad age group large gathering ""don't give fuck""ers Fascist ??? know number cases still reported directly CDC right? Supposedly, provided free American cannot afford still required 

The rest world...well, many countries form subsidized healthcare. pharmaceutical companies likely still make profit (although might make available cost CSR purposes) cost borne mostly govts (well, taxpayers). get vaccine free token price.

Tricky bit would poorer countries, particularly African continent. wealthier countries pitch help out. survey residents conducted city, 60% said rally postponed. businesses pressured City Council proceed.


This South Dakota. sounds 60% residents don’t want rally. come far backwards. father law brother law, believe virus hoax, talking anti-vaxxers dumb are, look say ""well know believe this, people believe coronavirus hoax, what's difference?"" know respond that. Like deer caught headlights, quickly changed subject.  

Technically flattened past two weeks (now WH receives results), steady growth prior (when results went CDC)

Make whatever will, happened \_a lot states\_ day.

Did utmost say way partisan political. She'll go history Lysenko Covid pandemic. saw Twister 1996 coined term “Respect Wind”, well, Eddie Van Halen anyway......

Believed ever since BANANABAMA! Yeah didn’t Spanish flu far higher death rate. Oh fact targeted young healthy people. HPV vaccine also gets special mention. far worst I've ever - shit unable lift arm meaningful capacity weeks. I’m taking COVID seriously possible it’s Spanish flu. Deaths per 100,00 NYC Spanish flu significantly COVID (470 vs 280, respectively). Sources: (1) (2) “Well except people twice.” COVID taxi squad, like baseball? ones live... true Well, people start dying front hospital ICU full stop acting like sky falling.  Stop going boats, stop. Cespedes Mets opted today going awol. eat two three times day. concerning shopping Walmart. Well Rock Terry Crews juice, they're exactly pinnacle health either. We've seen several examples COVID wreaks havoc heavy juicers. shit ain't good heart. Fire Nation? r/covidgret Eating dogs sub-human. Basically yeah. guess announcement one approved would nice start
  
On another note, interesting see news media making articles like even starting believe vaccine coming opposed ""a vaccine could never ever come"" like seeing months ago. hope I’m eligible get soon becomes available several preexisting conditions many idiots refuse wear masks recall reading somewhere major manufacturing centers respective countries like 10 14 part. could goosestep around rifle park tho right? earliest. likely quite bit longer; looking ~ 2 average incubation periods (10ish days) first new cases tested showing clear symptoms. Another week two top severe symptom onset, hospitalization, respiratory failure. Tennessee's handling COVID-19 consequences disastrous Tennessee race. question — I’m healthy teenager, even get vaccine it’s going (serious) uncomfortable side effects? Fever, headaches, aches might worse actual coronavirus symptoms get disease. Oh, I’m sorry, agree, easy! Thanks trying. Glad there. Hope inspire them! ""oxford"" oh yeah

""moderna"" dumb fuck gtfo Jesus idiot we’re repeating history prohibition next dude w number one symptom, lot times only, symptom Covid 19 loss taste smell typically comes back 2-3 weeks. Yeah go many many times, risk yourselves.

Honestly - see people getting brave this, see protests news getting sick so.....screw “imma get mine”.

of course thats one angle agree. suicidal cultists putting others risk. quarantined. testing sties tents setup parks. dismantled anticipation hurricane. know several people applied back March haven’t heard thing back. Eh idk kind got isolationist get whole lot concessions world war I. Big thing got WW1 shit ton money booming economy Yeah, obese doesn’t mean morbidly obese, others said, threshold 30 BMI 203 lbs average male 5’9”. imagine average “fat” person imagine someone nearly 300 lbs massive stomach, lot people seen “slightly overweight” (a chunky arms, bit flab around stomach) medically considered obese. average American male weight 195 far that. There’s lot “BMI” isn’t accurate excuses accounting body composition, statistically BMI way likely *undershoot* overshoot. golden goose muscular person BMI suggests “obese” due muscle mass there’s far skinnyfat people “normal” BMI range yet unhealthily high body fat% that’s balanced unhealthily low muscle mass. even true water fast. people think coincidence. two cities exchanged lot pandemic. *"" children become vectors disease, spread vulnerable teachers support staff would swift.

Recent CDC analysis Georgia summer camp seems indicate case. 4 day period spread point 75% tested (260/344) positive. looks like he's transitioning. eyebrows keep getting manicured arched. breaks would suck, dying falling behind worse. don’t think really change public perception trump point. People’s dissatisfaction towards runs deeper response pandemic Yeah, absolutely way multiple years fan-attended sporting events, concerts, conventions, conferences, international travel, theatrical performances, bars, nightclubs, name it. That's ridiculous hot take, taken seriously anyone.

Granted, period time (4-5 months, perhaps?) first non-trial individuals vaccinated society whole fully revert back call normal wait new cases, mortality morbidity steeply decline. everything goes well, fully expect ""normal"" return around May 2021 gradual improvements quality life beginning early December January.

It's difficult imagine given time ever we'll 60-70 percent world's population immune COVID achieve full blown herd immunity. Vaccines treatments make disease lightyears easier manage, eliminate need crude generally unpalatable unsustainable interventions like mask wearing social distancing. We've managing influenza various diseases way many decades great success. COVID different. pretty crazy tho Honestly, show required viewing kids. re-learned lot it. DarWin! meannn I’m completely honest, usually refer mega churches like “Six Flags Jesus,” try judgemental like 😂 Manly strong, inject snot patient. dealt something like late November. Fever, respiratory issues, pneumonia, constant coughing lasting two weeks. Fatigue like never experienced before. wondering. regulation removed hand sanitizer products? ouch bro.....really ouch. know many people 4 year degree still idiots? 4 year degree means fuck all. keeping tuition even online classes. Even pay dorms even using them. 50% side effects moderna vaccine, ill take vaccine except moderna one, last resort russian one Yeah agreed. dont think get it. continue wear mask everywhere wash hands. MEET MIDDLE MORONS! Yeah, death records occur Sunday--even if, fact, do. mean, hear history repeating itself, we're _seeing_ it. seeing MLB, that’s required finish season don’t cancel.

Cowards. They’ll continue fast breathing tube throat TLDR: 7 new imported cases, 36 new domestic case, 3 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 8 new domestic asymptomatic carriers

Translation:

From National Health Commission China, yesterday 02/08/2020 00:00 - 24:00 , 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 43 new confirmed cases COVID-19, 7 imported (Jiangsu 3, Shandong 2, Liaoning 1, Guangdong 1), 36 domestic cases (Xinjiang 28, Liaoning 8) new deaths, 3 new suspected cases, imported (Shanghai).

For yesterday, 10 COVID-19 patients recovered, 560 close contacts longer medical observation, number cases serious critical condition decreased 1.

Currently 95 imported cases (2 serious condition), 4 imported suspected case. Accumulative imported cases 2,092, accumulative recovered imported cases 1997, accumulative deaths imported cases 0.

Up 02/08/2020 24:00, 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report current remaining cases 781 (35 serious critical condition). Accumulative recovery 79,013, accumulative deaths 4,634, accumulative confirmed cases 84,428, current suspected cases 4. Accumulative close contact confirmed cases identified via contract tracing 791,776, 21,585 currently remain medical observation.

31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 11 new asymptomatic carriers (3 imported). 6 new asymptomatic carriers became confirmed case yesterday (1 imported), 5 released isolation recovered (1 imported). Currently 257 asymptomatic carriers medical isolation (102 imported).

Accumulative confirmed cases Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR Taiwan region 4,031. Hong Kong SAR 3,511 (1,959 recovery, 35 death), Macau SAR 46 (46 recovery), Taiwan region 474 (441 recovery, 7 death). Goals...  way US dealing COVID19 confusing. 

If understand correctly, even though tested positive, measurement taken (forced quarantine, contact tracing quarantine, etc.)? 

So tells got try behave yourself, that's it? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* might be, might be. don’t know I’ve never there. corporate prayer pompous show. Usually people meet person things like these, everyone breaks groups 3-5 ish people. need get 40% vaccinated+infected least 10% officially infected+30% undetected ones. Good bot anti maskers believe masks conspiracy,

Some idiots dont want wear one think it’s uncomfortable wear

Just look r/calgary mask related posts, you’ll find plenty Even side effects people still aren’t gonna take Good. Probably thanks tricks.  South Africa tests 6 times many people (per capita) vs. Mexico.

That could theoretically explain part 2.5x difference deaths per capita. Lmao none shit save you. Yesterday, 4,418 died: day yesterday 5,601 died.

It's least 30,000 deaths per week ages now. That's we're approaching 700,000 official COVID-19 deaths. Sounds plausible, one scam work, try another. Yeah result still marginal lead pro science political party.

That means country probably doomed. 

If takes much failure break polarized tribal political lines get bunch morons believe science die destroy nation process .... still means America probably whole planet f*****.

The kind irrational behavior continue spread around world radicalism fueled destabilizing conditions planet well unregulated nature nearly free global digital media creation mass distribution.

it's profitable divide people, they're going keep dividing people ignorance tribalism regardless country. see country really safe it. Either state run propaganda private media propaganda unregulated internet propaganda.

For one direction media without integrity destroying world's societies. 

If really stop think might anything that's ever invented that's powerful mass distribution media. Humans love entertained effectively turn captive audience reason. Combine data mining targeted advertising dirt cheap content creation mass distribution content get scenario media basically winds controlling world also always sale billionaire wants buy in.

What means consolidate media, freedom speech work way helps common man express themselves. Instead becomes way consolidated wealth control democracies world dirt cheap propaganda. 

Once ridge consolidated enough media get tell public truth public can't anything time endless stream telling people want believe eventually work almost every scenario.

Simply repeating propaganda usually works that's need laws media integrity whether like one dangerous weapons world. like virus goes people's brains rewrites belief systems. be, definitely be. past beauty copy paste digital media creation internet distribution used actually cost money distribute media alone pretty big bottleneck allow every crazy a****** idea potentially garner millions fanboys.

We need go back least level media integrity created publishing standards fiscal limitations non-digital media need bring back anti-consolidation laws media ownership. 

Personally think legally allowed business model mass distribute lies like Walmart allowed mass distribute fraudulently advertised products.

The news service repeatedly tell public lies extremely misleading statements effectively committing fraud.

if think news terms product would actually go buy store becomes entirely clear news regulated least enough fraudulent reporting kind significant negative media pretending informative news also regulated.

We allow people make like fake documentaries distribute like they're real, even that's officially news. hand really want regulate comedy science fiction anything that's non-fiction.

In short nonfiction integrity limitations mass distributed public. want stand yard scream crazy theories That's freedom speech might prevent arrested though eventually probably charged disturbing piece, also reminder speech really unlimited. better reminders freedom speech really means government lock say. mean businesses individuals need allow fair balanced say get equal time anything like that.

An easy way think freedom speech limitations kick house political views can't charge violating freedom speech that's actually thing. actually freedom called freedom speech limitation federal state congress making regulations regarding freedom speech though reality still make regulations hold constitutional review judicial branch. Low end medium-term estimates 350K 2 months ago. seen newer estimates yet, half million would surprise anymore. mean D614G spike mutation, new, around since February, strain swept Italy circulating Europe North America since. proven infectious original type, either, scientists said may infectious studied spike change, actually infected lab animals tried see D614G mutation infected animals, results inconclusive. media trying hype things up. players run around things like ""equality"" jerseys. ""all hospitals report deaths covid-19 similar way"" - far know issue Sweden.

""health authorities make national guidelines best protect elderly municipal care"" - analyses many different things went wrong elderly care early on. clear guidelines, since basic guidelines needed normal flu epidemic. problem guidelines followed, temporary (and unskilled, untrained) staff hired regular workers going sick leave informed/educated treat sick. Doctors adviced lower number visits reduce risk spread hospital care nursing homes places interpreted 'don't visit send elderly hospitals', also investigation. 

1 - certain types businesses public gatherings restricted Sweden too. people ignore saying ""Sweden nothing"". Daycares primary schools kept working, secondary higher education remote public private sector (and autumn too) people working home based national recommendations. 

2 - government can't interfere authorities specific role task given authorities government. authorities give advice opinion, government implement policy. Thanks wishes! Think Harley motorcycles sale widows coming months...😨  words, Sweden's attempt feasible then. Agreed. Repubs tried play hard ball wait last second figured side would cave. administration screams giving bills wanting negotiate blame side. know sides bad like cmon, tried failed negotiation method. funny ride bikes town hang outside masks probably huge risk.

The problem they're going need hotel rooms, places eat, places get drunk, etc... That's infections going take place. sides bull... They're regard bill, bro. Republicans literally trying make legal Wal-Mart send work without PPE without fear family sue oopsie get killed. think unreasonable concerned receiving rushed vaccine. We've instances vaccines manufactured normal circumstances problematic. pro-vaccine person gets, I'm little skeptical. government 100% blame critical thinking free. friends fucking morons even attempting keep safe, going bars shit Touching face times day second isn’t death sentence. don’t pick nose touching high-traffic surfaces.  Well guys pretty good ww2, letdown since then. Thats used shitty test private companies it. 3rd world countries get rapid results ans US takes week. beer walk home. It’s extra refreshing way.

Congratulations, alcoholic. comment political way, stupid Yup. look [REDACTED] protests: people masked could go stand something believed in; spike.

That better? state governments want override governors check power, free so. fully allowed enforceable, there's even checks balances involved.

Laws passed voted upon peoples' democratically elected representatives. Mandates, hand, not. gives things like regulation seat belts, public drinking, etc., legitimacy. 

You could argue since governor mayor also democratically elected, difference? believe that, allow governor mayor pass sorts rules regulation, skipping legislative process entirely? efficient? 

Have asked states pass laws masks social distancing? rely ""mandates""? facing covid since February, plenty time pass whatever laws need. that? Wait til current numbers get managed kids get sent school everyday pass go home night vaccinate everyone? medical field convinced infants feel pain operated [without 1986.

Non-white Americans less likely pain taken seriously less likely receive adequate care.

I know definitely given either way Good suggestion general, thanks overtly condescending. Here's thing. I, like many others, respect actual logic good science. see much either subjects. Obviously I'd humbled debate expert field expertise, refuse believe human's craft outside capability understand. beginning onboard, months without healthy discussion, much. comments appear turning childish, migrate Denmark catholic country?

(Info Denmark know already: Denmark first country legalise porn prostitution legal Denmark. Danish newspapers offer personal ads, completely public ads prostitution.)

The comment section **Ekstra Bladet** hangout extreme right wing section Danish citizens irrelevant think something ""serious"" not. mean laws fowrwads. restriction alcohol better. Again. That’s lot. know large NYC is?  Starvation, really? think that's quite stretch honest. People insist living way always have. see people spending lot money things need. go bar, eat all.

The hand wall months time make adjustments long term thing ridden out. Fortnight = daycare, obviously point people systemic failure levels American government. situation begin with. Parents weigh risks putting food table staying home teaching children. like fucking industrial age coal miner children shit. Little Billy go school mines today else can't get bread.

WE SITUATION. EVEN THING. Wealthy people saying ""oh fine pay nanny extra money"" going list first people wall thirty million people evicted. Jesus fuck. Americans - hate politicize crap, but, y'all registered vote? Or, moved updated tucking registration?

Your mother fucking life may depend it. Stay safe mofos. think politics affect shit life many ducking ways,you paying attention.

Also, assuming schools universities open month next. make 100k cases per day, 200k, 300k? would super spreader events happening literally zip codes America. DC move apartments get ""cheaper"" rent rate. rental increase current apartment still 3%-8% people moving droves. has, CDC? would poor life choice part.... Yeah man, they're absolutely amazing.

Some back story: work office three story building. department 13 people. 4 open floor setting (about 6 feet apart can't confirm.) rest offices doors. got notification late last week sent whole building someone tested positive basically thing worries alarm. Well departments talk manager since disappeared day (door always opened would office talk us.) Employers cannot give information one tested positive someone exposed direct contact supposed notify you, yes? working covid lucky. 
So I'm sure do? People come office take mask forget. 15 minutes though shared areas say sanitize/clean. cleaning crew, alternates whose duty work week imagine, doubt high levels clean. 
Now, gotten tested people have. waiting now. worried? high blood pressure control meds, mom recovering couple heart attacks stroke brother cancer (low immune system). meds controlling BP live mom brother enough sound alarm stay home. That's like everyone else, hope get pandemic dodging like fly window trying escape.

I thought maybe we'd quarantine said we're offices need. know need send email request know department work home til get test results...
I'm nervous send email boss stern set letting people work home. reason (her couple people random days/time wete met ""10"" people per county code) 

So advice next? Thank ramble help! cloth paper masks aerosolized

You make claim cloth masks useless. news absolutely failing compare COVID deaths causes death.

OP, congrats free updoots, shame putting blast little info what's actually going happen. Disgusting. things fair balanced. ""weeks"" sounds lightning fast given socially isolating since FEBRUARY. 

two shots spaced weeks apart waiting month sounds fine me. relief getting vaccinated knowing EVENTUALLY take non-essential trip store (still mask social distancing case) sounds like luxury itself.

Right i'm going store every 3-4 weeks that's time go (apart walks middle night). long takes special kind exhausting/depressing. Well ought fix that. Well starters medicine improved vastly since then. would putting masks assholes.

Wait... stay home moms never paid sure that’s different argument. I’m tangent... 

But opinion, isn’t getting kids back school sake kids learning, it’s kids aren’t school parents stay home, mean people can’t show work (economy issues), mean bills pile up... creates disaster already in. don’t think anyone wants really think that. that’s truth.

Stop catastrophizing. benefit context, article make look like Boogeyman? responsible thing. making clear count 100 percent effective vaccine solves like magic. shouldn't. Citing statistics “panic porn”? fuck? OP changes title significantly, evidence whatsoever? arguing dying COVID dying COVID. Since seem arguing authoritatively, explain better method slice stats; sources? article protests though. Post source links cases protests. Let guess, comment protests every time see something increase cases, negates increase somehow. sorry family suffering like this.

It makes mad see people deny COVID real hear sad stories like post.

Stay safe. went urgent care get test I'd definitely expect get charged. urgent care, Dr Health Department testing site. Unless there's contamination.

False negatives common, need know steps took determine new, active viral infections. PCR can't tell difference live virus dead remnants I'm northshore see far people wearing mask not. people wearing right even people far between. Even social distancing problem far felt unsafe since big break months ago. you? exactly expert field surely youd need additional testing find long term effects? Never underestimate power stupid people large groups... Yup 100% this. Mitch McConnell eat old poo finest poo. Wrapped $100 bills slimiest lobbyists side crispy $50s salad backs workers give damn about. man eats poo style. ""...there wildly different estimates Allied D-Day fatalities ranging 5,000 12,000. German casualties D-Day, meanwhile, estimated be between 4,000 9,000 killed, wounded missing."" -- basically, equivalent D-Day invasion every week month. new spelling? Republicans want lower payout $600 week made people realize bad minimum wage is. funny nature works. stranger even strangest fiction. Stop vote shaming. theory immune systems kicked higher gear caloric restriction drug use. never said dangerous, least Canada.

Yes did, said actually dangerous wear mask. know fact fighting entire time censored posting scientific sources stating safe recommended government recommendations. convinced far many Canadians masks dangerous.  might problem. think America great something good all. Yeap it’s better coming Yeah. I'm voting Biden, either.

Or Dem passing sort immunity.

This ridiculous. ""Every time walls shake due near explosion; shot!""

""WHOOOOOO"" Yey us, please use cm-tv source :D Hopefully anti-maskers Well statement making lemonade lemons. Could worse guess. lot things I’m thankful for. don’t consider unlucky. 

Maybe that’s propaganda taken root somehow, genuinely still believe I’m extremely fortunate. Rapid covid tests pretty inaccurate tested positive one I'd immediately try get regular test. Still, counted different category. tested one university one hospital, 38 volunteers each, June 17th. now, people vaccinated, try get newer numbers. Nobody side effects negative reactions, except higher temperature first days, predictable normal. Spending money save money. things mention upfront costs take funding/grants, mention approval red tape local state governments. None easy, quick.

Simply getting devices internet connection students' hands part problem ""how"" study. still daycare/discipline aspect it.

Being physically classroom ten times better child teacher alike comes providing education.

You still solved issue school lunch providing ""safe space"" children escape abusive/broken homes. endless distractions may face home (including siblings), teacher basically control students.

And parents need work, especially (or single parent) jobs require physically present? know, eh? Rapid tests shitty results. two kids 3 6. could probably put 6 year old charge.

Personally academic locked are. going anywhere. This, along simply minimizing risk. husband teaches return tiny HS classroom weeks. can't help that...

I trust kids smart mask wearing social distancing, can't trust peers. Middle schoolers notorious bad behaviour even good day. well, half people dumber average person. Covid 19 control people started rioting. parents would alive rioters. guys enough tests pets? not. said offer nothing aerosol transmission. offer nothing general, given droplet primary transmission vector.  area higher population density probably much higher risk people choose follow safety guidelines. Around live, walk blocks unlikely pass maybe handful people, regardless mask usage. city would passing people constantly, there's plenty people anti-mask, know probably wear outside walking populated area.  likely vigilante witch hunts. brought school. Fuck kid. going tragic. need repeatedly test guy going around players. That's asshole brings work gives co-workers. Surprised Pikachu political pole spent last forty years constantly jumping shadows reworking government fear refuses see actual, massive danger right front faces.

How...ironic? don’t like general idea branding individuals  Roald Amundsen definitely cruiseship bad capital punishment repealed Illinois 2011. ProTip: Whenever headline poses question, answer time almost always ""No."" Instead banning political observations situation become 100 percent political, sub ban articles give false hope promote not-yet-real ""advances."" one called fascism dirty restaurants closed last year meeting health standards. suddenly different now? problem assuming American population right thing vote protocols listed generally here, include distancing mask Im going buy box qtips open rapid test clinic Texas. sounds like easy fucking covid money results accurate flipping coin slapping piece paper results. Damn. guy far right (in suit) knew proper posture was. Solid 10 waiting stance. dropped ball gag went around looking someone fit like perverted Cinderella. 1600 people? See people like need read headlines people tell Reddit. data White House receiving directly hospital data. nothing reported $7.25 hour, half possible get places, cities would need 3 4 times amount. Remember people's initial response buy every toilet paper roll ever basically zero prompting. Imagine hectic things would healthcare workers people bought PPE too. lot battle getting R_t 1. masks distancing get 2, vaccine 50% effective, we're 1. Happy hear. wish realized worth joined them. need die part political stunt. Look regionally. example, compare Florida deaths vs New York deaths. total US number merging different events. parents Huntsville one educated cities US

Not even top  coworkers say every death assigned covid hospitals get money. proceed tell anecdotes people know told loved one died heart attack whatever assigned covid. 

This narrative I’m pushed right must listen science. great positive experience! grew mildy neglected, experience - context really matters.

I'm elementary teacher, taught teaching grade 2. Kids develop evenly across age, definitely executive function skills left alone appreciable amount time. 

If shut schools year, working class would collapse. instead keep schools open SEVERELY shift gears usual academic expectations social-emotional life skills. hard would guess would cost states, tbh Unfortunately, think even worse that. People want raise kids hard. kid goes private school families one parent working quite well off. last meeting had, parents insisting school take kids even though public schools counties near us completely virtual. Sadly, succeeded. course, we're letting kid go petri dish, questionable parents excited free time. Actually snowflake, turns people protesting senseless murder excessive force, tend give shit others people safety take adequate precautions killed 1,500 10-49 year olds (most 39) far. 

Does mean we're halfway scary? college students young drink too... year get another Katrina? It’s likely, it’s possible. many people die lack action major disaster occurs area already hit hard pandemic? Could imagine Louisiana current state it’s Katrina happened year? many 1,000s would die?

The death easily top 20k. That's immediate aftermath storm. Within 1 month? 100000. Remember hurricane size cover 2 4 states take whole southeast coast.

People packed together area many evacuate nearby states bring virus them, exposed virus, possibly both. 2nd wave come!

Survivor here. leave never come back. think I'd live long enough see meme come fruition... It’s fine, people glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. Factory farming US fucked up, contributes public health issues, it’s easier blame wet markets side world make sacrifices lives.

We could actually something CAFOs wanted. interesting many stories identical wording. dont go train dont live America lmao. Maybe GOP members also lame ducks finally stand him. think that’s they’re going wait till 2021 2022 release it. way see long vaccine lasts needs booster shot every months. Well, I’m one those. indeed many secondary effects economic restrictions, take seriously. also can’t stand people everything power help businesses open back successfully (masks, parties, etc). world nuanced, covid situation nuanced, hence solutions nuanced. 

“The people risk infecting people chose take risks. want get it, free stay home.”

This accurate. participating high risk, unnecessary activities, likely get virus spread others. Many people you’ll come contact directly indirectly categorically taking risks. 
The grocery shoppers, doctor’s offices, buying essentials hardware store, people line post office, picking food go, etc. workers establishments, colleagues work you, kid’s friend’s family members contacts. 

Do see I’m getting at? contacts people riskier. basically increasing risk profile everyone interact with, sit by, stand next — many best avoid virus. high risk high risk spouses/roommates/parents/grandparents/children/etc. don’t get choose come contact with. way identify avoid people going dinner parties, regularly eating indoors restaurants, going movies. Staying hole option unless rich, even high risk.

My uncle recently heart attack complications put high risk category. works Walmart, getting exposed dozens shoppers day. can’t “stay home” magically get paid without showing up.

My friend work retail lives elderly grandmother, shops cares for. can’t “just stay home”. 

My RN friends don’t get “stay home”, COVID wards 12 hours day taking care people careless got infected someone careless. 

What would say them? Spot on.

There almost always separate juvenile geriatric studies perhaps touch cautious, reasons obvious. initial Phase IIIs healthy patients.

Lower-risk populations get vaccine first, adverse events closely monitored. even 30-50% population get immunized within couple months, thing way out.  soreness last week's. H1N1 vaccine leave arm nearly dead 4 weeks lasting damage. Pretty sure nurse pinched nerve something. vaccine going hurt, H1N1 vaccine hurt weeks. Better dead. almost shares, mere months away possible vaccine approval? important vaccine living memory?? incredibly bad sign.

They started administering vaccine 30,000 people start week. chief medical officer promptly dumps stock week's end. NJ relaxed laws, something legal NJ area, something wrong. even let people pump gas. March, days Bay Area shut down, panic attack work. coworker drive home. embarrassed whatever. took long weekend, came back Monday, day told us leave. back office since! Placebo huge. Let give chilling anecdote. Early march, corona virus finally hit mainstream media outlets. Still public opinion like everyone else's [BAR doctor passed away Wuhan trying release word POS virus] nothing serious. early adopter quarantine im idiot also complaining throat pain, like something stuck throat. never went away, coincided bunch variables life constant weird ass throat pain. Fast forward present day, ive asked casual work encounters many talked weird feeling throats. influx information spread television online general wave anxiety people seem nowadays really plays mysterious seemingly important role symptoms. Science hope. Thanks saying so. Yeah, surprised got it. 

One small correction (I edited original post well), it’s ballot *received* *counted*. 

This makes sense anonymize things “secrecy envelope”, take inner ballot won’t know whose whose. 

Same thing far I’m concerned — election officials confirm it, know mail it’s job :) Agreed. Farmers education contact modern society send young adult kids work factories suddenly kids enough money fly zero education/hygiene parents commercial airlines.

Well course would owns part wonder causality relationship higher UV levels thinner air. Every 1000m altitude means approx 10-12% UV. I'm 62 man hair. want fit I'm yet. want live wrong? people ""might"" let in. administration pardoned terrorists, bear mind. I'm surprised actual Coronoavirus cults actively trying spread virus punishment God something.

I guess educated enough believe virus belong cult.  *Deadlyland*. 🎵A whole new waaaaaaaaaaaave🎶 always doubles down. It’s thing knows, projection.  1. never said offended angry comment nice try guess. 
2. Don’t see harm generalizations? sub loves think high mighty throw around comments like one. person ignorantly classified athletes idiots based group individuals one team something stupid. 
3. someone intends use group words “qualify” generalization, it’s ok? Lol lol. protective effects likely occurs people acclimate living high altitude.

Seems ACE2 enzyme plays role Pulmonary Hypertension, symptom altitude sickness. However, HIF-1α decreases ACE2 expression protects altitude sickness. 

This also protects SARS-COV-2, gains entry cells via ACE2 cell receptor. Fewer ACE2 receptors means person likely experience mild symptoms none all, asymptomatic, lower viral load, less infectious.

Interestingly, doctors saw similarity COVID-19 altitude sickness, including happy hypoxics.

I'm curious what's rationale rejecting conclusions study outright, especially someone neither scientist doctor? It’s almost like sustainable, long term strategy needed. country treated like marathon sprint... leave Canada 14 day Agreed issue public stupid regard. public knows N95 better protection cloth, people buy effective masks royally screw everyone. That's say masks. Might also lack 5g towers spreading corona waves.  High-calorie dressings plus lots cheese, bacon, etc.

(edit: 2000 calories may exaggeration, salads lot chain restaurants much less ""healthy"" one would hope for.) long vaccine things, we’re way good results.

Greatly reduce pneumonia. Maybe bring mild case bronchitis. Reduce fever.

Those two main things killing people. Chills, body aches, head aches. things easily reduce treat. fever pneumonia causing damage. guess I'll stop wearing one. guys motivated to. noticed telling people motivation behind anti mask movement.

We act like greed selfishness inevitable. Unless pressure rather extra UV lack O2 elevation important. 

My guess added UV tends kill virus. people even going cruises covid-19 still raging ? Why? thought mega-churches took anybody, think members makes look better. believe business people don’t go “right” churches going hell, would expect want save many people possible.  Agreed.

The corrective mechanism investors interpreting probable signal vaccine failure is, racing cash out. comments based read sub.

Awesome. comments based scientific research. Unless valid scientific studies data counter we're talking about, I'm going argue you. Wait minute... Let's see plays out... 😁 Whatever happen ryopus?  got flu shot (three years ago?), felt like charley-horse arm literally three weeks.

Mississippi ranked them. can't process gems transmitted understand scientists come recommendations, follow basic  Give man break. can't expect actually film mobile home duct tape wall. truck studio afford.

I’ve owned business 18 years; it’s snap ‘find something new’ middle pandemic soaring unemployment like pal Ivanka suggested.

But thanks kind words, you’re gem. Wow, I'm impressed. got county election board completely together. I've never heard anything like it. I'll let Governor Cuomo know. Really. Thanks information.you're 😇! Cases skyrocketing protests, like California NY. going seriously argue protests effect cases? That's insane. 

If rules banning gatherings bullshit. 

Pleas explain picture, distancing? Masks mask each. Yep, always variant this, circulating around FB Evangelicals: God protect unless he's mysterious instead. Sure, honest, reason horrified Chinese markets mostly China. It’s makes make decision. That’s all. Everyone makes decisions 100 times day thought America third world country jobs, dictator...

But yeah international fishing trip cancelled. dont understand get downvoted. Maybe alot swedes here. Nothing ease fears. live state constant terror. Appreciate advice. kidding. Also every time moderna reports success associated rna vaccine, stock price goes up, moderna insiders sell sell sell. Moderna’s pump &amp; dump game strong. arm gets sore good reason. 

Your immune system rushes fight thinks something bad, causes inflammation = tenderness. 

It’s actually positive thing dumb sounds, it’s indication positive immune response that’s making antibodies response dead virus shot. recommendation son-in-law Senior Advisor, Jared Kushner. know points toward immunity lot longer 2 months. Definitely not. Harley's blood falling ears loud. I'll take screaming 4 banger fucking nuke Harley use engines. never left dark part heart. “Everyone worst flu life seroconvert.” That’s actually true. number people Covid support group I’m multiple positive PCR tests negative antibody tests.

“The antibody tests find antibodies antibodies found.” Yeah, that’s point. everyone humoral/antibody response thing. people cellular/t-cell response ultimately immune system complicated still figuring out. variations immune response depending severity illness, body, etc.

It sounds like don’t keep studies coming out. find interesting opinionated something aren’t completely informed about, guess that’s America days. Technically, writing response, didn’t definition “bother with” OP? 

Also weird thing get offended by. good day I’d recommend online anger management class instead going days getting angry generalizations clearly qualified generalizations words “as group”. everyone u actually lool Sigh. Follow context. responding someone said maskers get 2050 care though

Regardless whether want it, want want it. greater good. So, that, would argue in-person option parents need send kids school?

And schools could absolutely mandate masks. State governments (who control schools) make laws stick them, it’d pain ass. I’m sure it’s daycares. got typhoid shot October, could barely move arms days. Hands worst I’ve gotten far. Yeah, wealthy elite fish primate. justifiable reason. people hoarded masks like toilet paper, deaths would skyrocketed....all people “got theirs” scalp price make profit......That actually good decision time - especially since virus really around much US time.... concern anyone CDC others wrong many things said Covid?

What wrong about? Wait till hear open-carry defiant BBQ restaurants Texas isnt 'area"" expertise, fact DNP anesthesia. However feel free look anything I'm saying propose counter argument instead snickering ""oh clearly expert"" rationale statement vaccines general safe. I'm open mind changed, far know largest risk getting CV19 vaccine would 1. producing significant enough antibody response providing immunity (this risk every vaccine, rarely vaccines 100% efficacious). 2. small risk guillian barre virtually vaccines, well understood cause is. However disease also seen people get vaccinated well exposed viruses. did. apologies, edited comment correct username tagged. could still close 8 weeks, time choose get control. work toward common good instead individual goals.

Well yeah would expect immune reaction symptoms means working Come on. 100% fault UK. went course sweden started something way late. Italy, France Spain hit without much warning. Everyone else enough time react simply didn't. Boris proud shake hands wearing mask Germany already mandatory masks. Lol think media going stop reporting ‘Trump Bad’ 90-days election?

What idiotic statement. even ignores exponential growth. read somewhere last bill plan passing election. Maybe that’s why, don’t want “work” again. Sweden universal healthcare, sure hell problem there. enough resources healthcare system corona, wait 21 days see GP!! Anyone wanna CYBER?

A/S/L first times. know. rhetorical question. see 30 minutes eating talking without masks kinda invalidates attempt making ""safe"" gathering?  Okay cannot person thinks sound crazy, right?

I've read elsewhere newer strain spike proteins makes easier bind binds human body, would conceivably make contagious, seen evidence even theoretical mechanisms would become lethal.

Besides:

- Overall mortality obviously compared initial outbreaks (improving treatments playing big role)
- generally common viruses increase contagiousness *decrease* mortality due trade-offs natural selection (more infectious strains kill people spread easily, almost always biological trade-offs)

Anything could happen specific virus, there's lot data science keep eye on, nothing suggesting increased mortality time. that. ones training next generation, seems less good? That's lockdowns stay home orders harmful.
Go take sun... Polio big outbreaks several years vaccine fully eliminated decades. without anti vaxxers without medical expert distrust.

We'll still dealing while, especially vaccine effective short periods time many scientists worried about. Oh great, whole new group people told anxious/faking it/just want attention. course post-virus stuff isn’t real people love going doctor reason (who wouldn’t?) Parabéns! We've really turned corner last weeks Lisbon area (where vast majority recent cases been). Targeted lockdowns, TTI, masks seemed trick.

&amp;#x200B;

A weeks ago coast week, since larger area lot tourists masks much common I'd guess still less 10% people used it.

&amp;#x200B;

Social distancing thing kinda. saw family first time since everything started recently day came met outside hiked national park. Similarly saw grandma bit visited coast met garden try minimise contact.

My mother working home quite long time overall lot workplaces taken measures reduce close contact. Ie web meetings instead going visiting lot sort things.

&amp;#x200B;

My pov government agency charge Folkhälsomyndigheten (FHM) politicians weak early respons completely moronic. way lot elderly care done I'm sure even could avoided lot deaths come strongly earlier rather weak recommendations think society would taken measures much much earlier could potentially saved lot lives.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean say gone lockdown necessarily done put forward someone could strongly say X, ,Z bunch people saying nooo think maybe can. Basically constantly put responsibility every individual citizen. want need stronger guidelines otherwise people keep everyone else stand out. wait see family keep safe, many people living Canada crossed border US returned Canada? get quarantined 14 days afterwards, seems like case trusting others actions intentions. 

When articles posted US/CAN border always, ""I still see American plates!"" someone mentions Canadian US see, ""come home then!"" jobs, homes vehicles (with American plates) here.

I return Canada border opened, hope threat completely gone (meaning vaccination numbers dwindle completely safe level). want family friends safe. really fantastic breakdown exactly Harvey guy got wrong this, stop endangering children faded orange god well turn food.

Yea issue health department systems many states running archaic setups weren’t designed modern times even pandemic upgrades necessary. It’s one day Sunday they’ll back normal reporting tomorrow. Everything isn’t conspiracy people However, proven giving money directly people spend generates excess $1 economic activity dollar stimulus. Giving money corporations produced less economic activity. Businesses would get money either way, one way means would actually earn it. I'm almost willing bet there's hefty price tag vaccine. government propping failing industries along response virus it.

UK government paying furlough months, try stop job people losing jobs long possible. Good riddance. know it’s good start doubt guy ""secret testing plan"" begin with. OK, maybe testing plan, sure covid cases. Seriously. reasoning back March since NYC Europe general dense spread easily subway hallways stairways brownstones. since south super spread out, people use cars people live detached houses. harder spread.  pandemic, pays discourage visitors I'm done cause actually listening saying, focused attacking. Said another thread:

It pretty much would. vaccinate high risk individuals health care workers teachers actual pandemic over. honestly don’t know long takes that, know people sub want pandemic last forever urgency world right don’t know could 2-3 months get vaccine people mentioned

My guess pandemic late November means anything veins similar condition have. 28 tries get IV placed one time. got port put chest afterwards. doesn’t draw blood (most people’s can) blood draws still suck, get stuck week, permanent line next 7 days, collapsed veins, IV blows leaks. 

If happens often, I’d consider asking doctor general surgeon one might appropriate you. exactly happened AZ. lost track amount times flipped yelled Ducey (from couch) press conferences past two months call bullshit. made reason going give us can’t breathe mask?! Yeah 200k happen sooner later global joke... He’s biased. anything, accuracy numbers called question even now. No. corona. least thats article read claims. reduce amount people coming hospitals drunk accidents (fights, car crashes). regulations, making lax bad. 

TLDR: read first paragraph regret every egg eaten last three months been, understanding targeted ads based location enough people using abandoned  Yeah. state dependent. since states can't print money going pretty big issue... Yup, done whole 12 hour shift bit day Thanksgiving getting cussed types likely wearing mask hooked ventilator. Welcome club, young ones. little town packed tourists weeks. 

It's infuriating Others pointed study show long term organ damage. say said irrational, would stoke irrational fear others. statement one could get idea even mild bout disease good chance leaving permanent damage, idea backed know. Relax Sturgis officials discussed canceling rally determined wouldn’t matter, people would show anyway. Locals aren’t necessarily thrilled need economic boost, many rely rally yearly income. South Dakota low population density thusly dodged ill outcomes pandemic yet. Kristi Noem enjoys high popularity conservative state. source says shared data BBC ""shed light truth"" end ""political games"" epidemic. 

Political games fu\*king virus killing citizens, got low life pos total pos follow orders. favor bringing back catapulting punishment? beginning treated COVID-19 control prevention based knew SARS MERS; community spread prevented isolation normal infectious disease prevention like hand washing disinfecting. greatest threat two diseases healthcare personnel, want public go buy surgical masks PPE knew would needed caring patients. 

What changed? Two things: asymptomatic carriers upper respiratory tract infections. 

SARS MERS great setting residence lungs upper respiratory tract, that's makes easier control spread either virus compared common cold easily infects upper respiratory tract lungs. COVID-19 infect both. significant number infected people never show symptoms mild symptoms overlooked, infect people. 

Either one situations scary enough own, combined? Nope. soon confirmed recommendations began include masking; experts studying issue prior that, doubt timing updated recommendations coincidence. privy discussions, though, speculation. SARS-CoV-2 similar HIV ways could complicate vaccine research? corporation falls, lot small businesses lose money. Like personally lot local welding shops fucked...as well fiber glass shops. holy fuck automod actually got LOL short version major problems get swept rug japan.

No testing? problem. government told ok travel japanese flock disneyland. maybe open industries get people back work think later study said need evidence determine whether causation. evidence correlation. clinical trials cash university. give blood times day weeks, quickly learn good getting bloods.  Article dated July 16, 2020 nothing new view.  sounded scary 🤷‍♀️  I'm starting get cabin fever.

I've essentially locked since March, time go groceries. even got rid tinder vaccine.


Dr. Fauci, I'm legendary dry spell. Plz help  get chills body aches, obviously tenderness, every vaccine get. It’s fun. remember kid got polio vaccine arm totally curled &amp; swelled go get second shot relax muscle, apparently claimed I’d rather polio. Many antimaskers figure covid dem. hoax hurt Chump's re-election.  Personally huge majority think ignoring virus, downplaying letting Fauci speak hurts much chance getting reelected Depends. Boom/Bust cycles rampant trades brutal body. licensed masters/journeymen, apprenticeship process involves Herculean efforts gatekeeping. happens winter? -Trying limit spread death rates continue fall. 
-Recomending masks cdc admitted solely make people feel better. 
-Speaking hydroxycloroquine citing appallingly flawed studies.
Pushing patented remdesivir failed ebola due nasty side effects like liver heart failure 40% patients.
-Inconsistent reccomendations.
-Failure publicly condemn China.
-Funding research China banned congress US.
-Pushing ""second wave narrative"" already beat once.
-Implying need lock again.
-Pushing ventilators. 
-Failure condemn putting covid positive patients back nursing homes.
-Supporting opening schools fully. 
-Failure acknowledge likely eventually get virus. 
And list goes on. large bump, level off, large bump, eventually though exponential growth teach everyone works.  light fuckery coming around numbers, really thing gauge situation. Takeaway: corrupt administration scrapped national response plan time virus primarily crippling states voted them. It’s astonishing. People fine making athletes playing without masks wear safety lol stayed home interact anyone, would know worked? Past simple vs past participle fucker.

VBPS? changed since then? think need define ""anti-mask."" I'm using mean, ""people vocally assert 'right' wear masks."" people simply chosen various situations, *unless* situation one masks required law policy. I'd put anti-mask category well. see suspected liberals wearing masks? think getting parents work.

Basically shutdown two weeks, pretty easy say essential/non-essential pay people two weeks (not saying everyone did, plausible) people could make due two weeks (again, saying everyone, people).

Now we're talking *months* restrictions. really good system set deal that. Companies basically forced reopen parents forced return work limited child care options. can't drop grandparents, might cashflow get daycare, daycares even open. fall, they're going classes too.

There's good solution.

And buy idea Trump wants get bunch people sick, simple stupidity explains it. voter base *old*. think deliberately wants kill old people tend vote republican?

Yes, parents brought us to, better massive fight far home. Nah, Lombardy pretty cold winter/early spring– similar NY. same! interesting point. need new strategy US. places masks distancing work, people choose follow rules. obviously working many areas, need take new approach. point anti-maskers lost freedom subjected high levels testing since can't wear piece cloth.

Face mask face mask. issue covering piece cloth perhaps debated pandemic far.

In 130 countries, citizens one way another required wear face masks various contexts. World Health Organization turned issue early June agreed mouth guards used difficult maintain physical distance. Yesterday, Mike Catchpole, chief researcher EU agency ECDC, spoke spirit.

Sweden becoming increasingly lonely demanding form face mask public context.

Something likely change first place.

- Sweden, make political decisions comes infection control, leave experts. see situation, sharp decrease spread infection, would appropriate require oral protection public environments. follow science knowledge put Swedish context, says Minister Social Affairs Lena Hallengren (S) press conference.

She refers Swedish Public Health Agency, recently yesterday stated requirement oral protection relevant. 

- comes public environments, Public Health Agency continues follow state knowledge. 

#""Has nightmare""

During press conference, Hallengren praised Swedes' responsibility pandemic, believes crucial improved situation.

- many ways, time nightmare. New rules guidelines involved major trials. Jobs lost many experienced months loneliness, says Hallengren continues:

- important remain toes limit spread. need millions wise everyday decisions. Care determine Sweden copes coronavirus. Wow, fun teachers. Let's prepare next week's lessons... oh snap! redo online now. absolute rubbish. relevant section, translated head health network Higher School Health Quchan city informed re-infection 30% patients coronary artery city emphasized: total 31 people re-tested coronary heart disease witnesses, unfortunately 9 people tested. positive figure 30% number participants, indicates disease permanently immune.

It's obviously nowhere near perfect translation, worst interpretation currently infected people, 30% re-infections. absolutely thing 30% previous infections re-infected. even seems limited people coronary heart disease, maybe people whose COVID-19 infections caused coronary problems.

Gonna try bring corona way  Shit today word \[gaslighting\] used describe attempt destroy another's perception reality.""\[9\]

Exactly, that's pretty heavy shit.  ""Attempting destroy another's perception reality"".  intense, deep-rooted, emotional, relationship-based manipulation.

If ever relationship like that, know somebody has, know exactly means. insidious it. takes entire life sense being.

An organization downplaying COVID sucks, something different that. company might lie something. might even fall it.  that's pretty limited part life, contained something.  ""destroy perception reality"". girlfriend, maybe mother one time, could that.  (Fortunately neither gas-lighters). would kind access me, power, shake entire perception reality, abusive dynamic present. Hey, post new subreddit, r/conservativecocks! people think going gathering (where eating) 15 people social distancing everyone wearing masks? I’m southern US way. ""So sitting cubicle today, realized, ever since started working, every single day life worse day it. means every single day see me, that's worst day life.""

Peter Gibbons, Office Space Dunning-Kruger? Cross contamination extremely important. see people wearing n95s supermarket. They'll leave, go car touch handles contaminated gloved hands, touch steering wheel, purse name it. take n95.... great. Good you. Good coated belongings potential virus.

Your hands clean last thing touched. Ideally sanitize LITERALLY every time touch something, unless mind spreading potential virus it... Brilliantly put. IIRC, SARS caused fair amount long term complications (but much severe virus) responded me, oh pinnacle rational thought. too. I'd love go back work industry last go back. testing?? point, probably 82.75, single point less. There's basic expectation first world countries go hospital need medical procedure. COVID. Literally lowest bar think everyone agree with. don’t want cause argument. Please understand I’m asking sincerity criticizing I’m trying understand.

Why would effect mask usage different one country another?

I’m United States, country room criticize anyone. It’s academic question.

I understand need 80% usage significant impact don’t think convince 80% Americans wear next presidential tweet rate, entire patriots football team going opt sit season out. blame all. wearing work public businesses appropriately. Great , vitamin stock. also, noted relationship. See Odell's statement NFL owners seeing human. Literally even remotely apply said. Every politician lies. say live here... shut foreign mouth cunt I. Still. Do. Not. Accept. The. New. Normal. With. More. Individuals. Dying. Year. After. Year. can’t hear you’re saying. Deaths usually lag indicators weeks. hospitalizations infections starting drop deaths follow week two Yeah considering many students parents struggle pay tuition consider comps BS. think ironically proved point. 

per article:

11,000 per week = 11,000/ 7 days week= 1571 ppl per day 

YOU:

11,000 / 31 day August = 354 ppl /day


But somehow still managed get math wrong unsurprisingly, came 370 


Back original point. actual faith sub actually “mostly” sharp (the 1/25 4% reference only) simple minded outliers. come full hate think giddy misery.    
Most stance ridiculous anger pitied. MD seen spikes Flordia Airzona saw things well.

MD's largest county ok. 17% states population 10% cases. meet criteria banned NY, though barely.

The Baltimore region driving cases now, April DC region. Monkeys  think case generally healthy person greater chances specific relating vitamin deficiency.

Telling somebody vitamin helps fight covid seems dangerously misleading. Telling people take care keep healthy fight covid seems good advice.

Also, advice get 20 minutes sun somewhat misleading too. actually means, actually outside, suncream actual skin exposure.

There also better sources vitamin supplements certain foods. Telling people take supplements lead people overdosing vitamin like frequently vitamin c. YES LOOK CLOSER PEOPLE WEARING MASK PROPERLY, EITHER CHIN AROUND NECK MOUTH THATS WORKS FED PEOPLE GOING WEAR MASK MAKE SURE WEAR CORRECTLY Ofcourse can. that's entirely fair. I'm mainly talking strikes feasable. well known increasing viral load makes COVID worse. lot exposure much dangerous bit exposure.

People isolate possible. Upvoted 'one' middle exclamation mark puke. Please tell I'm wrong. give ""iTs fLu"" nonsense, that's implied. Rather 'it's yet another contagious disease', likely ""burn out"" weeks/months. gonna nonsense indefinitely?

I'm simply saying prior COVID similar seasonal contagious disease killed many at-risk people year.

COVID much lethal flu, statistically speaking. Yes, novel scare du'jour change fact far contagious disease kills. brutal. Hopefully someone reads realize serious take steps minimize risk. saying good bad? we're solidly Republican Dear Leader said hoax. Since we're allowed challenge anything power structure we're going . . this. Apparently. Wear mask minimize risk. Change daily routine happy. Well going way everywhere. spreads chances gets adopt new mutations develop new monster. yes, usa mega fucked near future, economically health wise. waiting game now.  media awash doomsday reports effective COVID-19 vaccine hopeless due seemingly despairing rate people’s immune response virus dissipates time, two recent peer-reviewed papers provide increasingly strong support notion effective vaccine is, indeed, possible.

There hope. Try panic. Imagine thinking actually quite good born poverty creates lifelong obstacles. entire family went wedding weekend. mom doesn’t believe masks. everyone hugging dancing together. 75 people. begged mom days please socially distance wear mask. Stories like scare much. could literally lose several family members one event. People don’t believe till happens them. sad. Agreed. resources sure. relative ones hoarding sake power masses. People make fun conspiracy theorists would lot fewer constantly lied first place. I’m absolutely disagreeing US government people handled fantastically poor fashion, you’re disregarding fact schools opening worldwide isn’t good solution education childcare elements brought otherwise. Why? society?

Well, one, country huge culture anti-intellectualism decades. also, I'd wager guess many conservative politicians currently trying make coronavirus outbreaks bad possible try justify martial law delaying election. Well, extrapolate other, similar viruses. science well. set hypothesis based experience viruses: ""COVID-19 lead long-term damage certain % patients"" ... time tell whether hypothesis correct not. exclude it, ""no evidence"" - responsible well. think would irresponsible mention long-term damage possibility.

Fact virus infections lead chronic diseases people. different COVID-19? problem - far patients COVID-19 virus infections. means, society level, problem chronic diseases might much serious due absolute numbers. deaths important others? see insane is? mean, went away Easter, one big charade everyone playing get Trump office. ""stay home"" mean isolate drink death. means avoid certain social activities basically guaranteed contract virus point. that's pandemic  see riots idiot Obviously anecdotal, I've seen among coworkers younger folks renting moving back mom dad duration save money get away one roommate take whole thing seriously.

Yup, two best friends moved back parents place, they're 26. One married, wife moving back parents six months try raise max offer house - shit - $750k $850k. went golfing yesterday told him, ""Even income pay house expensive, think could it. I'd move state get house Portland half cost. Everything currently Bay Area, Portland."" That’s leaders supposed crisis. Lead people right thing. unfortunate people place go besides home. technology politics may change time, people largely not. No, ""Money dictates lives"" is. Yes word changing ever since coined 

From good ol term ""gaslighting"" used colloquially since 1960s[7] describe efforts manipulate someone's perception reality. term used describe behaviour psychoanalytic literature since 1970s.[8] 1980 book child sexual abuse, Florence Rush summarized George Cukor's Gaslight (1944) based play wrote, ""even today word [gaslighting] used describe attempt destroy another's perception reality.""[9] OPEN SCHOOLS DURR!!!! worst part seems vaccine close people put masks stopped complaining many people would survived. Nobody stupid enough buy unprofitable business.

EDIT: Robinhood traders.  Returning life normal solution. Things horrifically shitty right restrictions safety measures have; things would incomprehensibly apocalyptic nothing.
The (very vocal) minority people fighting return normal part shit bad; people stay home, think. probable going get groceries every weeks, catching virus store idiots, seems like nothing. nothing would truly disastrous. would closures even grocery stores pharmacies employees sick (like actually happening meat plants such), would mean [more] people would go hungry, go without meds. Supply chains would totally collapse instead delays.

 Hospitals already overwhelmed/close small percentage (+/- 20%) people hospitalized virus ( 6 8% testing positive every day). already affecting people struggling life threatening issues like heart attacks strokes. imagine 60 80% people testing positive every day. Holy fuck. 20% would vary hundred smaller towns/counties tens thousands bigger cities. That's day, people severely sick need ventilated hospital WEEKS. Millions millions people would dead right now. Perhaps millions millions children would orphaned. Truly incomprehensible. Damage would irreversible. Apocalyptic would probably understatement. 

Not mention economy. economy shit right now. would MUCH WORSE. can't even really say anything else. MUCH WORSE. 


In Sweden, method waiting hard immunity turned disastrous; highest mortality rate. 

Also, coronaviruses herd immunity possible. People get viruses people get immunity virus. presumptuous assumes covid-19 same, good possibility. would lose millions people right away, would never stop. would wave wave wave. could pretend life normal long society would fall apart huge gap population quickly, affecting businesses, supply chains, government medical field, basic way life. 


No. Going life normal happen even possibility.


This article kind trying answer question personally think depth. I'll post find Ah, whole 'more one person evil, therefore let *everyone* evil without repercussion' argument.  


Just curiousity, how's working you, US? Ah. Sorry bout that. There’s stupid people actually believe said never know what’s real what’s Maybe learning hard way change public position - though doubt it. Assuming succumb illness together like many people age have. hope die, want anyone die it, would certainly push forward message ""wear damn mask"". city employees work home. Non-essential infrastructure wait weeks. places, already waited decades. That's gave list above. covers everything named off. Sam's Club many others running ""humanless"" card gas stations time, 90% population home, demand gas stations would go way down. side risk aisle 4 days recent news accurate last month's, reopening going infect many people, kids effective carriers often asymptomatic. parents teachers, much. “We made nothing mistakes” walk got strike.

And keep ignoring:
* chronic underfunding public health neutered ability prevent spread
* bloated, inefficient health-care system left hospitals ill-prepared ensuing wave sickness.
* decades-long process shredding nation’s social safety net forced millions essential workers low-paying jobs risk life livelihood
* racist policies endured since days colonization slavery left indigenous black Americans especially vulnerable COVID‑19
* social-media platforms sowed partisanship misinformation 2014 Ebola outbreak Africa 2016 U.S. election became vectors conspiracy theories 2020 pandemic

IQ knowledge related high IQ result higher academic results (therefore potential knowledge). One high IQ low knowledge. call ""Street smart"". One also low IQ high knowledge. call Sociologist.  Fear keeps alive. guys making America great Well they’re certainly trying stop it... Edited ""calling around"" tie back previous sentence. Thanks! US unofficially “given up”.  We’re letting people die mass sacrifice insane attempt revive corpse economy. 

Ironically economy would recovered faster taken seriously.  country next deaths per day low numbers ages take incredibly seriously. 

No handshakes funerals, hugs, hospital visits, leaving table public spaces, limited numbers buildings. 

If approach wrong person, get aggro asked to, ""Respect social distancing."" love it. 

Finally personal space, room lines breathe nobody know nobody know even taken it. 

Yes died. usually idiotic story attatched it. Like camping group house party so. Thats natural selection. 

Usa government messed peoples brains. goes Brazil.... government fine jail fuck social distancing again. LOVE IT. unless black. Cops HATE black people Montreal. essentially burned way vulnerable population. vaccine. People decided live slow disappeared extent. became flu enough people infected point 1/3 US population overwhelm hospitals. would call herd immunity less people suspectible flu. also mutated less deadly virus. 🤯 deserve this? family might issues (like alcoholism) meet drinking. MAGA news source Facebook read lol oh COME Itd minor miracle took loved one ventilator. fucks dense one 3 weeks 50/50 change mind. College merely gives tools educate yourself. That’s becuase entire Bay Area moved Tahoe....permanently fucked locals already. beaches trashed, traffic Town PACKED. I’ve never seen anything like it. great parents parenting. someone needs pay food, clothes house household income goes 50%-100%. bring kids work?

Or ""their problem""?

US care children, parents teachers died afford medical treatment. ""their"" responsibility money. 20 parents died cancer 2 months apart, 47. really hope able get grief counseling, something desperately needed never got. also hope extended family him, mine pretty much abandoned me. 20 tough age, people think adult, really grown kid needs guidance alot bad things. pray self destruct. Geocentrism thing though (and John Stewart joked; spelled wrong). rioting hasn’t helped either. already phase 4 reopening: denial. tall. Fewer Trump voters They’re won’t forks least first 21 days... Yes especially LA wealthy flaunt cities IMHO Geez 

I reading comments joke 

Doctors USA fighting war, virus stupidity joke, dont think read well lol. send kids /teachers/ faculty back school? quarantining their? going home? breaking errands supplies? serviced? get deliveries? strict fast? 200k still acceptable? far yet............ kicked yet willfully violating mask rules? Omfg teachers town local news call teachers concerned covid pussies daily. Murderers gotta murder meant \*eaten headass Totally okay me. way still protects others it’s one less person can’t spread Weaponized stupidity 
than Looks like reported symptoms hasn’t gotten test sure replacement Führer furor intentional not, like it. ""Its flu babe swear!"" completely nonessential. 

I agree. 

This $$$$ said irrational? study provided backed said. remember article next time wonder happens government regulations removed exactly correct. mix science politics don;t end new blend, ""science-politics"".......you end politics. 

The White House screwed bad hard believe. problem is, Trump always thinks smartest person room. second-guesses experts. birds get it? What's next...Orioles??? /s really? bad according numbers eaten restaurant since started. see time soon. place survive takeout, landlords unlikely give break heard. Sure hope ready meet Jesus That’s thinking, amount doses supposed getting end year, I’d imagine herd immunity wouldn’t take long achieve approval. They’re trying. Couldn’t live long enough tell it.

If anyone honestly thinks virus came bats, Saturn sell you. It’s figure mean planet.

The frustration comes Trump Administration. chill 6 months, implement mandates masks social distancing, setup Medicare all, freeze markets, government backstops everything. 

Time would bought, curves lowered, problem solved. know case numbers reported states CDC White House, right? silly question, tell wear mask go hope get it? mean oxymoron, unless forgot /s 53$ month 92% loss means making 8k year prior.

Doctors nurses shouldn’t put BS. US, federal government taking advantage nothing hospitals hit 100% capacity. Doctors nurses obligation work ridiculous hours days save people seem everything possible die COVID.

If tons doctors nurses quit, maybe federal government would forced actually try resolve crisis. Nobody gave shit ton kids already daycare last five months providers working entire time, apparently totally expendable get paid fraction teacher salary. post removed because:

""Anicom said still premature determine whether two dogs truly infected virus owners' virus might temporarily entered mouths trigger positive results PCR tests."" time disheartening knowing whole world actually afflicted dumbasses pandemic coughing someone, one most, most, common mode transmission absolutely different spitting. Especially considering context. society?

You're seeing results death cult given reins power stop progress 40 years.

This Evangelical Christianity. 40 years breaking norms, systems institutions GOP. would say none us truly knows lots people getting virus second time either reporting it, dying. Can't go based statistics available us. way real numbers...

Viruses continually evolve mutate different strains. Going tough tame beast. YES. another great example. cloth mask stop truly negligible number aerosolized particles. 

You correct people wear masks considerate (to stop many respiratory droplets), lower chances getting sick (to stop people's respiratory droplets), reduce amount virus breathe (see above).

None means cloth masks stop aerosols. don't, least significant numbers.

Fortunately, seems aerosols dominant mechanism spread disease. Neither we. hey, thought riots bad before.... Herpes-covid anyone? devil went GA, lookin’ soul steal... intubated sedated days/weeks need rehab get back normal. They'll need build muscles back up, get help swallowing talking, generally get support would difficult get home. probably also order fine isolate. that’s it’s control stay way create coaching programs doctors.

I think ego part problem, sure. also lack time training.

Endocrinologists disproportionately see cases like diabetes. really great identifying treating diabetes.

They spend far less time obscure endocrine complications may experience one personally. knowledge stems textbook read decade ago, sometimes difficult recall symptoms assess it.

And doctors really time constrained. like TV broad spectrum experts devoting time solving single case.

Just LMAO. That's all. *Go Team!*

Is gist insult? Impossible. 

I've told someone tells biggest amazing truths one day we'll wake gone like miracle. (He’s right, know...) Come man, America. We're going that. Well, she'll surely get COVID jail. whatever floats boat. 

Government tells people masks work: yeah, masks work! FREEREDOOMM!!!

Government tells people masks work: CAN'T STEP MUH FREREDOM!!!! Unfortunately really position feel comfortable asking. many run-ins ""conservative"" coworkers chilling effect me.

Last week report work despite slight (100F) fever weekend prior, feel comfortable contacting supervisor. They’re blocking sidewalk they’re setting tables street would normally parking spaces. There’s still open sidewalk restaurant outdoor tables. don’t count long term health facilities hospitals....

So “society whole” less... 

But seriously doubt protesters rioters/looters affect them...

So guess pertains microcosm looking Contact tracers banned asking went protests. Junk data, irrelevant study. take nationalism push somebody else's face could kill everyone city three times still match amount people died country we, country, handling right, I'm going sit pretend everything's great USA NUMBER ONE WOOOOOO! 

Refusing recognize there's problem large part problem. refusing acknowledge there's widespread pattern behavior literally killing people country going benefit anybody. Oh damn, fell fake news again. guess assumed CBS news agencies run completely distorted disingenuous headline get clicks. Neither companies sell expensive suits. 50% phase 3 drug trials fail. thing too, I'm sure we'll ever find whether insider trading reducing firm-specific exposure. normal drug execs dump stocks want increase public confidence forthcoming product, though. really wished implements quarenttine people handful states, like NY Hi did. can't fully recover tourists come punishment wearing mask. Idiots cant seem understand stay home 15 days could kill surge. Thank you. wish anyone.  Eat rich Jus tell survibality like 98% make change mind/feel better buy pharma hospital group stocks. parent 3 kids caught something new every time go pediatricians office, even well checks vaccines, sure fucking hope so. 

Our doctor also giving car-side vaccines rad. Depending situation healthy one might tent. camp time vacation - like camping sort torture. everyone lives Arizona, summer temperatures quite comfortable. stomach virus went around office June (right forced come back office, even though us WFH fine). Thankfully covid, real eye opener quickly virus spread confined area. kids go back school, we'll get flu too. Sounds like something massively inflated defense budget could help with. even redirect defense R&amp;D streamline medical technologies make treatment cheaper. subreddit this? remember /r/NUMTOT looks inactive land own... employees? Current students? Endowments? heck would know they're married whether spouse insurance? dumb assumption.  Thats kinda anecdotal it?

I spent 20 min trying Google study comparing family size vs rate adoption. many adoption studies hard sift through

I necessarily saying wrong much evidence prove saying. Man, go back school shit? I'm not. can't make fuck em. I'd rather uneducated give parents Covid. use word please asking stop... Thanks explaining instead downvoting. weird keep comparing rallies ""Democrat Rallies"" rallies exist. F say poorly, said highest. Please try stay topic.

The US neither cases per million deaths per million. again, second compared covid flu stopped reading, clearly understand severity what’s play.

Are fun writing comments I’m even reading? Cause you’re wrong never convince otherwise

Views like pandemic isn’t going anywhere positive anytime soon it’s like flu!

just monthly. Except diseases exhibit behaviour usually identifiable sub-types (which COVID doesn’t have, least far). get _exactly_ form Dengue first time round, fine. goes pear shaped catch one _other_ three subtypes. Like said - maybe healthy people tent. Winter camping also thing totally doable. actually prefer sleep cold hot. priorities groups ridiculous. Yes, thought disease caused Miasma- bad foul air. could sometimes true- eating foul smelling food, drinking foul smelling water would likely make sick. diseases didn’t fall category couldn’t explain came from. though? Anti-intellectualism rise USA time, I'd say he's symptom problem cause. Forgive ignorance, Covid blood thinners made hair fall out? bother? penny, pounding. backfired time. should. Yes! police proper job once! opened summer camp Georgia. That's 1 death minute. Clearly amazing ""understanding"" skills even need read competing ideas formulate pre-determined view

Let guess, worried enough ventilators? worried FL, AZ, TX overwhelmed even though none numbers declining again? scared shadow. Stay indoors let everyone else carry on. need education reform pretty badly. master’s mechanical engineering. Thousands people gathering across entire US shouting also spreads it? thought covid would give break cause. get that, insulting society whole say parents want daycare. Public education backbone social structure. Anyone educated publicly parents able work day feed house ashamed say that. Education one biggest government budget items, need daycare. backbone free society parents able prosper raise children time. vote like schools essential backwards hear people champion saying matter. Public education write bills fill pockets sweet sweet cash. wrong. 100% wrong. create people? failed spectacularly turned normal person total garbage? Spoken soon? get COVID one particle virus. need exposed certain amount virus particles order infected. called infectious dose. may find amount considered airborne enough infectious dose, amount water droplets breathing/coughing/sneezing is. yes, mask may still effective containing virus.

As far know now, wearing mask works everybody cooperates. We've already dozens epidemiological studies showing work, specifically virus.  Fly Covid conspiracy losers Kansas leave month.

&amp;#x200B;

They giant stupidity orgy sneeze whatever idiots do. Horseshit. one wears mask 100% protected. wear consideration lower chances, does. recent evidence points lowering viral load severity disease significantly lessened. It’s unpopular opinion, might modern travel, including planes, cars, public transit, even bicycles, detrimental least pregnancies. get commute go job, baby wants vessel sleep more. nothing else offer attacks? Funny two mentioned oat milk. thing use milk “overnight oats” ... guess try replacing milk water? Overnight become oat milk? That’s different topic sir judgemental prejudice one people haha ok again, second compared covid flu stopped reading, clearly understand severity what’s play continual attempt get people believe science stops working ""noble"" cause comes around self-defeating.

So, what... they're lying? Nah. know idiots, four them, told mom. read prospective bill? can't remember country (it Europe) found even though traffic dropped impact number deaths saw less traffic led higher speeds higher speeds led fatal accidents (not accidents, speed higher likelihood would fatal) sǝʎ Yeah, that's true summer necessarily bad. Getting sent tent winter due Covid live might worse. 

Camping torture, course. Ten days nonstop living yard pretty sick, isolated, likely without safe bathroom access, plus pests possibly bad weather... That's camping trip. getting cold camping pretty miserable. still stereotyping entire group people one dude. seem cool seems like warm lovely person. Sorry think I’m going trust article written Nobel prize winning scientists one bit anecdotal evidence. 3-5 years hit full vaccination/normalcy Inited States. Get right? said Fed calling for. Fed never calls one party another anything explicitly allowed thing. call Congress collective body stuff. get shit right. 79 Yeah true.

Luzerne county 48 new cases yesterday (ON SUNDAY) since May 10th. I’m nervous next weeks.

""Bu-bu-but everyone keeps saying there'll vaccine Christmas!"" No. Majority die. gonna change entire world though true. Good people afford it. Crazy that's low end - 4 hours/day 3 days/week. plenty fake internet points. Don’t mind losing some. pointing it’s handled work. don’t disclose tested positive, someone has. It’s hard figure person though. Test it, prescribing patients Covid. proven screwed access people need treatment. feel like kids' education jobs program. school begging parents make kids go music PE emotional learning online. Nope, core subjects, teach things. putting kids computer 7 hours day save someone's job.

I sent kids school socialize peers around people diverse backgrounds experiences. teach stuff.

20 percent district already pulled kids homeschool. Mostly ones afford stay home least year. get lot representatives senators go sit classrooms 8 hours day prove safe. DeVos play role teacher. even bring cat pictures. Sure thing. four, plus bag gold. I'm generous Redditor.

💵💵💵💵💰 wife take round chemo every month whole year. don’t let go store creeps like this. hope gets book tossed her. thought fine improve employment seems like odd metric use. done India great success actually. Poor families less poor stable, better medical outcomes less hunger. Yes never said ""no transmission"", sorry. corrected statement instead quote directly, added links support comments. wished nobody die this, matter stupid malicious. said, much sympathy others. I'm obviously referring nfl, need try get little zinger make  point.

Schools tho, also remain open. like nfl, ufc sports businesses across country, covid thing deal with. Also anecdotal, generally kid sick stay school, elderly parent needs full time care, women family caretaking.
Not anecdotal - men much, much likely leave relationship partner seriously sick injured.

I think used playing role caretaker, easy downplay seriousness illness dealing personally (yet). Working retail I’ve encountered many people. One time customer came return bbq grill apparently broke. said problem asked could get product, said broken threw out. call manager gentleman could understand couldn’t give money back. people would wear beach they’d work She’s handling relatively well, cannot help feel anger thinking ifs. medical care? Would things different? baby wanted, whole family looking forward arrival. know angry lockdowns her, cannot like her. didn’t say reflected study said reflects people. asked type idiots wrote articles answer type idiots win Nobel prizes. try say saying something else didn’t say. sure use lot fallacious arguments arguing others using fallacious arguments.  issue generally 100,000 protesters exist vacuum. go home families go shopping. We've seen superspreader events happened gatherings 100 people went infect thousands others. Sports pandemic enriched elite (or kept same)

It pulverized poor many countries, leading starvation. 

And middle class huge chunk simply wiped out. 

All restaurants, cafes, small businesses. Gone. wonder Americans realize bizarre sound rest world talking cash bonds like this. mentioned dozen audio report that's playable first paragraph. would kinda difficult count exact numbers kind unnecessary splitting hairs anyway. People come go, leave 10 minutes, get half hour late, leave come back...pretty standard give rough estimate crowd size even small numbers this. Support government agree it, agreement, get team.

You backwards, government finally got team. Brazilian friend who's studying Lisbon crisis began left Brazil cos thought would better family home, regrets decision :P went football practice without mask. words would carry weight followed damn advice. A. comparing city country.

B. 2nd wave Melbourne Victoria soooo close control dropped ball.

C. puts rest States hold higher alert fact ready increased economic activity wait.

D. goes New Zealand hopeful opening Trans-Tasman bubble would realistic possibly September anymore. Touché Evolution action. really think underestimate fatigue feels like. think anyone complaining fatigue hard time readjusting work. Dr. Immanuel gift keeps giving. one vet background? I'll best that. I've people tell God white. Masks alone. Closures restrictions things like indoor dining large events still necessary regardless masks masks. Here, colorful Monopoly bucks💶💶💶💶💶 Ok, fair. thinking about. mind recommend against, sure, way phrasing it. positive masks answers. Birx’s statements pandemic pissed Man Cool bad many others zero cohesive plan whatsoever, countries opening we're still here. Stupid anti mask, perhaps.

But incident coast cruiseliner / expedition cruiseliner still isolated incident far able conduct contact tracing isolation with.

Masks might become mandatory I've heard public, got understand, cities Scandinavia plagued deadly smog dust like alot Asian cities. Masks normal part day day life.

Because actually effective lockdown march, government able conduct contact tracing isolation effectively, virus spread control. far anyway.

I think reopening gone quickly, especially regards catering peoples luxury needs like traveling abroad, tourists come country. 
The tourism industry cities rely tourism places spring/summer season like other, completely blowing away predictions Norwegian tourists (I'm going local rather describing entire Scandinavia) would buy stuff locally spend much money foreigners...

They kept borders semi closed important goods work related travels year. would problem all. “First, trajectory moderate initial infection followed severe reinfection suggests novel coronavirus might share tendencies viruses dengue fever, suffer severe illness time contract disease.

Second, despite scientific hopes either antibody-mediated cellular immunity, severity patient’s second bout Covid-19 suggests responses may robust hope.”

The possibility second subsequent infection worse might line timing severe cases amount deaths currently seeing. circulating longer originally thought seems like would line current severity. pessimistic article. western countries distributing vaccine big deal. Like 50% already flu vaccine. would suggest lobotomy skull seems empty. make it, Harley never updated styling, image, performance, relied legacy brand status, sold (now outdated impractical overpriced) shit old people brand loyalists since 70s. Motorcycle ridership overall, addition young people know spend money smarter different brands caught nostalgia Sturgis, Harley, similar events communities surviving on.

I'm somewhat new rider, rift riding culture old classic touring/cruiser crowd young people sportbikes night day. “Republicans”, Congress. Get right please  NHK aired documentary late Feb early March showing experimental computer simulated evidence airborne spread. actually showed micro droplets suspended air. experts lot 2 months behind what's publicly known Asia. Thats hippa works. Enjoy downvotes. Honestly I'd rather live onion world, sounds lot pleasant. SNL South Park parodies past years normal normal too. would curious toll would actually double time. Influenza virus going around kills people. Sometimes even common cold it. I’m curious see herd immunity diseases affected time fabric? thread? needles? china somewhere logistical chain, friend. infectious disease inevitable tiny percentage technically capable reinfection.

This new. People whose immune systems shot one way another initial infection almost certainly get infected again.

But various harbingers doom keep missing something critical:

There 10s millions infections worldwide point. documented cases reinfection near zero.

10s millions people worldwide changed ways got infected first time. They're living like before, cases acting even freer. not, broadly, getting reinfected. Yea Texas pretty boring.. went Colorado like last month holy shit like fairytale land much better places too. can't excuse countries taking virus seriously lol hence *some* I'll check ""Field Schemes"" India four times population far higher density less daily cases, overall cases, deaths do. Try again. CDC looks various models came RANGE 5,000 11,000 deaths week ending August 22. 

You're right money! Darn that's sad. going grow hella fast now. Sucks virus taking away people's families childhood Woooowwww. real piece shit. beginning sound like MAGA person pointing BLM protests ignoring gun toting anti-maskers Trump encouraged multiple tweets. mention sending federal troops Portland increased folks protesting. there's fact Trump recently endorsed wearing masks. Yeah, school teach midwest thing. But, like, class 90 minutes together. Yes, unlikely would get side classroom, still could come contact them. Plus, us teachers talk students time walk around room. 

I'm sorry school irresponsible too. heard this. source? this! 

if truly lost ""freedom"" wouldnt able stay comfort homes whatever want pandemic rolls on. ive mainly staying put since march besides able hang friends much, im still everything else normally do.

 want talk loss freedom? go part jewish population WWII, slaves America pre-civil war, really, black people american 1960s. THATs loss freedom. 

did travel plans summer? course im bummed cant year worth risking cause want go town times. like, im sorry (not directly using ""you"" general sense) cant go beach, take vacation, hang local bar every week, braod scheme things, really isnt bad. part spring, wouldnt mess now. get emoji moneys? Texas actually better average overall, least death rate. They're ranked #28 US terms per capita deaths, 26.10 deaths per 100k US average 46.72.

But recent curves indeed horrendous. Here's case/death state's running 7-day average deaths moonshot. Sounds like country good response pandemic. would able keep hospitals open. I'm sorry relative's child. news? ""To help students get back shape, middle school eastern Jiangsu province started requiring students run least 100 minutes per day."" Agreed. People still fighting mask mandates. Kemp GA still fighting prevent local cities mandating masks. still national leaders pushing “HCQ” refusing wear masks Many people Florida old Fox News addled conspiracy partisan hacks thought arizona cardinals, got relieved lol Georgia anti-union. Mathematically, US second wave. Cases counts, hospitalizations deaths clear peak, clear trough, second clear peak. trough go zero wave, mathematically.

yes understand first wave Northeast centric second wave could arguably first wave south west. country, inflection points pretty clear. North. want specific privacy reasons. central bank assets GDP increased 16% since 2008, happen stops? think economy grow?

If fed prints money needs sets value so-called free market, world lose trust USD.

The country also flooded cash right now. Nobody wants borrow money future looking. real risk hyperinflation everyone essentially ignoring saying ""it work like used to.""

Federal debt necessary growth sustainable. know I'm talking one guy. There's millions people like guy country.

We nearing 160k dead remotely control, people like guy big part that. literally don’t know literally means.

What, specifically, say unsupported? confounder countries rely cars muted excess deaths stat far less car accidents vs ones rely public transport. want see many people dying covid necessarily indirect effects well. whole point looking excess deaths find deaths related Covid19 undetected testing. read reply? 

The countries massive issues countries ‘Dear leader’ mentality, like USA/Russia/Brazil. 

The current UK situation relatively control since early bad decisions late February early March .Daily infections daily deaths reducing since peak April. Remind USA doing? 

The USA federal government led start instead leader didn’t know want know it. Instead blamed everyone else. Remember said ‘I take personal responsibility’. Yup. We’re gonna see 2000 dead day. Enjoy series finale America find sympathy waining types *this* one expects pro-science left governed Nordic country behave: recommend masks (ok tbf gone far enough yet, well way) also try make accessible may represent unexpected financial burden. misunderstanding comment, point downplay severity. They're pointing stories far bewteen easily looked past. CEO thinks same. Mad scramble new job. company even following state mandated mask order. like idea. problem lies central AC. would honestly give finger. awful administration. sense leadership. always best upfront. “You’re going tired winning” Let's focus getting folks first home start thinking second one. $66000 per month still fucking crazy. State skews numbers make things look better are. Others pointed states deal new individuals positive %.

In Florida test positive every day week count one positive, test negative every day week count seven negatives. ""hoax Democrats"" Joe Biden president, suddenly entire GOP become concerned Covid group history pandemics. I’ve teachers clearly like children made days miserable. couldn’t good conscience students.

It’s also won’t children lol. Babies children deserve parents 100% PSYCHED them. I’m fence means probably shouldn’t lol don’t want risk building resentment giving shit upbringing it.

I wish people line thinking. theguardian New Zealand newspaper. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* spinning I'm saying. I'm downplaying severity high risk. However, fairly young healthy, almost chance becoming significantly ill. Significant instead large meant say.

And clarify forget ambiguous cases minute. way works moment could wacked head cricket bat. icu die brain haemorrhage testing positive covid still added 'covid' death count. really thinks that's right?

It sounds ridiculous is.

This whole point. even need evidence pneumonia. Testing positive alone dying enough get added overall toll. Proof? tell random Dutch person calls fucking dumbass. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* think Americans would love track visitors country regardless reason.  people know personally couple CT directly linked index lawyer case New Rochelle. Apparently, kid function friend caught it, died it, funeral, whole CT circle got infected.

(Edit: well, medical friends, meant terms community spread) thinking half mil too, trying little positive. way 250k though. Yep. nation, we’re becoming numb tragic deaths. becomes personal people really start care. I’ll ask you: families parents work (or single-parent families adult works) young, elementary-school-aged children supposed do?

How keep children’s education also still making money family?

Not asking snarky; I’m genuinely asking don’t know solution. Maybe meant Trump win election there's hope us then? needed contact tracing jump street. can’t introduce successfully COVID spread large sections cities population. Christ, poor kid. survivorship benefits something? exactly fair (though surprising least) family required take on. anyway I'm sure they're good people, ***something*** place putting burden extended family. must missed did. I’ll go back check out. Thanks heads up. give one country problem....Brazil (bunch too)

If want read whole study here's gist....(this prior Persistent regional social inequalities resource allocation left poor, lower education populations living northern regions greater unmet healthcare Shortages doctors persist rural areas PHC level, specialists concentrated private sector unequally distributed around country, leading large disparities 

 

I find mind boggling people think universal healthcare solves problems. Doctors, facilities, etc infinite. larger countries population, worse gets. 

If get seriously ill (cancer, etc) scans surgeries delayed still see private sector even countries universal health care. People money able get treatment timely manner.

Free healthcare nothing can't see doctor equipment run life saving test. bit hard say things actually improving due testing sites closed down. Different parts state hit worse others. test reporting dips higher hit parts state, could make look like things getting better really are.

That said, test percentage seem improving little bit last week. look % positive reported Miami-Dale, 19% today whereas around 25% last week high 30% couple weeks ago. certainly promising. could still hurricane related data throwing numbers off. think we'll really wait see stuff changes rest week really say stuff getting better. #Transportation:

The proposal based Danish Health Medicines Authority's recommendation face masks event congestion public transport.
It expensive groups society take public transport wear face mask.

This opinion Unity List, make face masks free charge citizens least money.

- believe face masks made available low-income groups. must case also afford take public transport, says Unity List's health spokesman, Peder Hvelplund.

More specifically, Unity List wishes grant face masks to, among others, pensioners, early retirees , students persons integration benefits. 

- imagine get one-time grant, makes possible pick masks free pharmacy, says Peder Hvelplund.

The Unity List previously proposed requirement wear face mask public transport , therefore opposed new recommendation.

- must wear masks want include vulnerable public transport. context, must exclude another group letting pay expensive bandages, says Unity List's rapporteur.

#SF pressuring Minister Health


It Unity List believes financial problem groups society engage public transport following recommendation bandage.

SF also sees problem.

- use lot public transport, cost masks become great financial burden, says party's health spokesman, Kirsten Normann Andersen.

According Kirsten Normann Andersen, first time SF tried raise issue Minister Health Magnus Heunicke.

- already told Minister Health find solution citizens enough money buy bandages, says.

SF yet decided whether face mask free, whether subsidy.

- solution must found, whether grants grant, must find out. important thing find solution, says SF's health spokesperson, Kirsten Normann Andersen.

#S: Right problem

However, Social Democrats see problem SF Unity List drawing.

- see hit people hard terms spending, says Rasmus Horn Langhoff, S’ health spokesman.

At time, however, emphasizes something government aware cases citizens could afford buy face masks.

Especially rising demand face masks results higher prices.

- keep eye price development stock development follow closely. must become situation experienced hand alcohol, sold supermarkets sold overpriced prices.

In situation, government prepared intervene, Langhoff cannot put amount trigger intervention.

- must something everyone afford use, throw amount says cost, says. You’re looking right perspective. old days land key prosperity. Yes, days over. one invading anyone part foreseeable future. point dominant military ensure status quo system rigged America (and allies). America easily wealthy nation disproportionate share wealth economy equivalent land years past. worlds important currency dollars. worlds profitable resources (oil) traded dollars reason that’s way America wants get rich it. important path wealth worldwide commerce important way trade way overseas. Guess owns worlds dominant navy (by far it’s even remotely close) keep trade happening America wants happening with? America gotten involved countless places keep becoming threats juggernaut system prosperity. 

Now isn’t means patriotic post. Often path top amoral one. US also fortunate geographically way nation able dominate oceans. Perhaps USSR chance see happened there: America decisively modern war. war territory economic war USSR contained constrained withered. also think America slipping badly. dominant military machine still cancerously eaten within. Perhaps it’s bit “good time create weak men, weak men create hard times” portion cycle? patchwork medical billing one reason we’re starting something new today: soliciting medical bills. We’re asking send us copies bills coronavirus testing treatment, understand costs look like across country. want know patients managing medical bills midst pandemic. part larger effort understand pandemic reshaping American health care. 1% number good curve flattened hospitals aren’t overrun. US get bit younger average. read articles address explain US's high obesity rate concern. guess understand exactly mean overlooked. want addressed? whom? combative. know lot people making changes better. wondering exactly kind coverage think would help.

What suggest obese people do? losing weight overnight.

I could link 100 articles talk problem. Personally think another example cognitive dissonance getting best us. even articles highlighting impacts obese people would even people willing say ""this fat person problem"" give life back.

1. fat person problem. person know severe long term effects runner 30s.

2. fat people contribute economy. parents children need supported. people would otherwise least seen kids school. Martinez, man ventilators! really overly dramatic reply... me, four years intense focus beer, weed, vagina. Suggest people like me? interpret title like that. I'm sure looking us lesser beings assuming interpret titles wrong, please, fuck off.
Also comparing CDC predictions fortune tellers? fucking stupid you? troll? nobody even half brain would compare CDC statistical predictions fucking fortune tellers. doubt number high, far high, let’s pretend even single predictive model thing remotely correct point pandemic. Noice hear that. Good luck family, internet hugs! correct model know describe neighbors norway finland.

Don’t think people state, end crisis sight, likely start physically join protests causes happen agree with? actually saw one protester small ICBM. good week mask salesperson Sturgis. flip side, great week owner walk health clinic.

From entrepreneurial standpoint, smart money owner walk clinic sells masks patients. Oh wow- that’s great! Hopefully continue. maybe we’ll eventually get another stimulus check. would make world difference many people. don’t think do, least way. think one person pointed out, drive movie theaters get real popular again. hometown reopened theirs! 

I also wonder massively effects major movie franchises. Think MCU, Star Wars, Etc. heard Belgium thorough? South Korea. Vietnam. probably more. Oh thank god, thought lost second said ""gaslighting another word form lying"".

YES, needs relationship. IMO, personal relationship type psychological manipulation possible.  someone expresses disagreeable political opinion, tries get away something unethical. Right?

Yeah, least we’ll never hear reporting. fact I’ll probably never get “real” reliable number infuriating. warm-up phase. distance learning, barely able correct share tasks. 180 pupils tend to.

A lot poor families likely at-risk people living home well, sending kids school additional impacts them.

The point - complicated sucky everyone. think fair assume everyone childless 20 year old. failed really address core issues nation sending kids back schools likely cure poor families believe be. sound like American. Argumentative perceived personal offense hojacking thread focus you.

Everyone except knew person meant. go on. can’t believe you’re American. Holy crap, saw commented figured coming say right.

I mean, yeah, maybe argue ""significant increase"" means, Florida peak reported per capita number deaths week New York reporting day. And, despite others claiming growth cases would exponential, happened. fact, cases numbers are, expected, already going (following curve everywhere else significant community spread followed) expect deaths follow trend.

The fact sit use death numbers fraction New York's somehow claim victory exponential growth predicted hospital overflow predicted come pass (despite Florida issuing neither another lockdown even statewide mask mandate) really astonishing. Hey, since anyways, dog super clingy. love her, can’t play right now. take back toss stick around bit There’s reason said “most cities listed”, rather “all”. get drunk enjoy beer lives Johns Creek, one richest suburbs Atlanta. plenty donors around. I'm sure going better many others lost parents this. Ya goodbye someone still thinks Obama anything significant. hope enjoy throwing money away frivolous government spending. Pandemic would exact results. Can’t legislate spend disease away. mom said it’s like sending beehive hoping don’t come stung... seems shock awe thing convince people going start showing people mountains bodies virus creating. People illiterate.

Ugh. 

I words anymore Please let happen LA work five days week followed eight days time off. time leave get groceries stay hell home. caught heat relatives meeting dinner yesterday evening special occasion. saw someone mention day bring *all* students back campuses, bring athletes back football, going tough NCAA/schools continue walk line paying athletes calling ""students"" first.

So keep money flowing football, schools going bring *all* students back, create petri dishes towns colleges exist in. course they'll send students home around Thanksgiving kids infect parents/grandparents.

never life would imagined decision makers football would wield much deadly power entire nation. Luckily relatives stay with. Otherwise would ended foster home I’ve getting milk local diary town. Shit goes fuckin hard. Minors copy adults
We need better, instead suggesting open schools, maskless. Besides, bear load life. reason want schools open, big psychological burden carry. Thankfully people like sure remind kids wherever go apparently ONE FUCKING CARES!! 

WHAT FUCKING HYPOCRITICAL COUNTRY LIVE IN!!! 

HOW MANY HYPOCRITES? 

Raise hand. 

I never wanna hear word 9/11 allowed continuing allow. 

And condolences LIVES LOST THROUGHOUT TRAGEDIES CRISIS.  Football training isn’t exactly house party, agree that’s poor decision part family. see twitter feed working football scholarship, *might* seen acceptable risk. Blame shared football coach scheduled workouts (and didn’t enforce social distancing) well state officials said okay pandemic. June 16th: Covid-19 deaths: 29,514 reported excess deaths: 26,791  July 18th: Covid-19 deaths 143000, excess deaths 190000.  comment literally you. Looks like France under-counting massively. keep thinking please.  Adapt.

It's honestly kind jarring many people saying ""things might go back were"" like kind shock.

The world changes, need adapt.

Anyone thinks things always going consistent always able things enjoy naive. Yeah, pretty much. Clinton campaign, we'd beaten thing Clinton would've impeached allowing handful die. obscene. know getting voted. used care homeless people found. soon able find housing reliable food, gained 20+ lbs, go outside - exercise diminished too. Follow-up labs much worse. 

My take observation homeless: 

1. Eat less - one meal day common, intermittent fasting.  
2. Walk - many walked 10 miles per day (or more). 
3. Sunshine comes naturally. 

BTW, want homeless problem solved, think something teach us. Makes sick know people honestly believe hoax election disappear. flu. can’t anymore people. MIL FIL people, infuriating! Covid. FIL thought whole time must allergies. wish guys would but...i belive, sorry *Some people. heard going get Houston too. depressing. would even able contact trace was? election coming on, ts going continue news.

The number people would need die people ignore horrifying thing think about. less 1% Maybe. possible recognize point, accept correct, going look possible reason ignore it, tone?

Have considered possibility that, voting democrats, given political authority, granted whatever vestige democracy exists, hideous butchers, makes complicit barbarism?

Or much handle, going keep head asshole? Well said Try imagine coordinated bipartisan effort would underway @ 1,500 Americans killed terrorists day. effort would spared stop threat. say ""never forget"" something forgettable event. 

I think anyone generation ever forgets COVID-19 even actively try to. Help! send common sense hand sanitizer please. guys keep Vegemite though. Actually Title: _Daily death person due corona Quchan week_

The title fake. small number people retested positive. 30 percent previously positive covid 19 patients.

In CT we're issues state idiots flouting rules flood in. lady Alabama two week quarantine travel second day shopping ""It's vacation she'll damned spends inside"".

The idiots coming things get better elsewhere. Let kids run wild, fuck it, would still better option sending back school lol wearing one. kids want can, they’re mandatory Grade 4 (I grade 2 year). 

Not sure air purification would be? We’ll probably hand sanitizer wipes spare tho. could've donated tests communities color.

Oh, millionaires billionaires. 

Yes, NBA people care much.

China? China good, wrong says NBA. Hmmm. That's far point.

I've mostly heard complications lasting effects hospitalized, much people lasting effects hospitalized? still got people anti-mask protests... honestly baffling stupid incompetent people be. I'm going intentionally rude this, frankly comment completely unnecessary. obviously I'm still Reddit. implicitly referring IG, FB, Snap, etc. rude. Granted protesting pandemic certainly isn’t ideal, compare protesting police violence taking wholly unnecessary trip Disney World, located one worst hit states, laughable. dig deeper hole it? nothing. single person going ""good"" president corruption heart it, fuck, dude, would rather almost anyone else president right Donald Trump? vape. Around time frame, developed walking pneumonia. bad continue work, doctor gave Z-Pack. resolved weeks. 

Nobody else work got sick. 

I still little bit pain lungs that, nothing terrible. Oh yeah, real. fatigue light considering, I’m collapsing anything way tired normal often don’t much energy anything. exact point trying make. It’s misleading ignores fact United States rampant obesity public health issues drastically overlooked pandemic. 90% agree. Masks help prevent spread can't social distance, social distancing really need right now. Stay inside! think crazy. may place norm hazardous, feeling different means cautious, appropriately - feedback makes feel different keep strong safe! Also, can't responsible peoples' risk tolerance (or ignorance) levels, right yours. Remember people gathering streets every day night 2 months straight coincidentally coincided massive spike covid19?

Pepperidge farms remembers. 

Its pretty interesting people thought cause worth potentially millions lives claiming mad few. Meanwhile US taking challenge... ew! ugly yellow things? suppose opioid meth crisis dissipated since stopped talking news? Kind like national emergency Mexican caravan coming besiege border stopped well, lol. 

Yeah social fallout pandemic going awful, going get worse. Day election - day ""democratic hoax"" global pandemic over. Fucking bradster That's ten fold increase.

No biggie. Expected premiums rise nearly 40%... Wanna bet kid careful brought home parents? One caveat.

If like hyperparathyroidism, make sure Calcium levels normal. could raise Calcium unsafe levels could cause problems like strokes heart attacks. Serious question, sort stories routinely ignored European parade stupid newer phenomena? I’ve seen much it, would pockets ignorance, sure, generally seemed people across pond apt trust health officials mostly right thing (not always, mostly). hand, we’ve still getting right. America low-hanging fruit point. happen? thought virus low death rate yet kills both? problem is, even if/when show videos patients dying lined vents hospital...... fear mongering!!! can't fucking win subject chosen side mattering. Aside loved one dying close them, sure anything convince otherwise. fucking INSANE. noted mask wearing recommended Sweden, people lazy wearing masks, follow advice wear masks. old father go hospital wore mask berated health personnel. wear mask berated doctors nurses Sweden. least case recently.

Now exist accepted evidence efficiency masks tone recently shifted. seems like even get mask recommendation certain environments. title read ""How America defeated America"". try testing instead re-trying shit like masking lockdowns goes human nature fails? I’m six months everybody’s acting like really mean time, it’ll work. required 100% compliance even effective, ain’t gonna work. It’s widespread lockdown work unless people quarantine. won’t know “a weeks” turn months can’t leave loved ones unattended long. Masks aren’t going stop requires everyone wear perfectly. please test people isolate positives trace cases? doesn’t eliminate spread either, least we’re perpetual Hell masked uncertainty. Yeah, live Florida I’m sure you’re actually getting better deal one Projecting run MAGA hats Sturgis. lolz sorry guys wanted see would happen theory nicotine binds ace2 receptors, means there's fewer free virus bind to. Nicotine also increases ace2 expression ex smokers higher risk ace2 receptors nicotine stop virus binding. sounds like lying.

Is lying ""gas-lighting"" trying get someone believe something that's true?

By textbook definition, know lied to, gaslit.  ""We gaslit"" makes sense. Ah tests 50% inaccurate result. see started stopped? Largely due feds escalating - shoving people unmarked rentals help, either. 

Also non-zero amount footage used Fox News Portland. (Un?)fitting username. This. followed vaping disease time personal reasons final verdict. thing too, ""Stores"" Whether Apple Android/Google, stringent requirements Target SDK, minimum SDK build against. Thats another nail coffin older devices.

The thing bet relies heavily Bluetooth 4+ technology around long minimum requirements. From. would much higher ""with"", everyone damned thing.

Google ""Excess Deaths"". 6x deaths blamed pneumonia previous years. end year 10x victims pneumonia USA 2019. That's weird, it? pulmonary diseases could pneumonia be?

As ""with"": find non-COVID cause deaths went year? erroneously count ""with"" cause death significantly, every misrepresented causes death significantly going down. not.

We seeing sharp raise COVID like diseases, non-COVID cause deaths went down. tells us ""with"" never cause high numbers COVID ""from"" likely reported. Missiles flying back forth 

Ok bro must help colleague here....although amazing news Portugal, please please please, can't stress enough, ever circumstance reason whatsoever ever life, regardless event people involved, absolutely never million years go source news cm tv!

Thank understanding. respect upbringing appreciate viewpoint, glad relate.

I really wish make partisan matter. What's excuse education failing Dem-controlled cities urban areas? Truth is, politicians sides inept care donors people represent (for part). Rural areas nearly affected inner-city poor, ain't exactly ""MAGA country"".

You could argue one side care ""those people"" would argue side feigns care insomuch get votes. Right? think little concerned immediately makes anti vax facebook mom like 95% reddit would like make as. someone fun. allowed fun theReddit hive mind isn't. allowed angry people wearing mask attend protests say otherwise downvoted oblivion. It’s much like 9/11 level attack every 2-3 days people pulling stops get kids airplanes. Florida.

We good.

We dropped 250 dead day days 75 day.

Nothing suspicious going here. That's good start. Could unpack that? Especially thinking patient show evidence pneumonia counted? much ambiguity think would eliminated data? Also, want know credibility training area, like statistics epidemiology? personally, lot armchair wing nuts love spout half-baked opinion. fair amount people work home. Well that’s much lower number, rate roads claim more. That's great point. saw 11,000 thought nothing much it. 

But that's like four 9/11s every week month. *august: ""hold beer"" kid literally lives 15 minutes away me, breaks heart enough people taking pandemic seriously. work retail days ago watched full grown adult meltdown refused put mask store required. sucks people like parents everything right try avoid getting sick suffering many people careless selfish. Poor kid; cannot even imagine deeply hurts unexpectedly lose parents age 17. seriously applaud mature keeping wonderful positive attitude happened. going get worse. summer heating up. People go more. People take masks more. No, antibody tests. unlike 27 states, excludes results increasingly popular, rapid COVID-19 tests numbers reports publicly — obscuring scope pandemic, records interviews show. antigen tests used doctor’s offices, hospitals stand-alone clinics deliver results less 30 minutes.

You tell way use word 'antigen'. saw Onion article June? ""City Enters Phase 4 Pretending Coronavirus Over""? put perspective you, 4,000 people 0.001% people 44 living country. So, no, get scary. number things younger people come contact daily basis pose higher statistical risk death. That's minimizing risk poses elderly people (especially preexisting conditions) but, far, virus minimally affected younger, healthy people (the majority population) likely fearful/cautious.

Remember new virus research changing daily. Back April told wear masks unless sick wearing gloves, stockpiling hand sanitizer, wiping groceries disinfecting wipes. Today, neither CDC believe spread surface contact believe masks reduce transmission 95%. 

Point go we've seen willing recognize wrong something learn new things. far, virus poses fatal threat *almost* exclusively old sick. I’ve getting advertisements Canadian government immigrating there. Canada seems really appealing right now. data sent admin instead CDC now, I'll curious numbers skew it. wont able hide refrigerator trucks though. Asymptomatic spread wasn’t known back then. 

What you’re seeing real time science experiment things change things learned about. I'm observing behavior around makes wonder even would enough. matter grim information, there's steady ""de-amplification"" response. ""Here's cherry picked piece data, context, seems like good, minor importance, post response."" ""Oh, pile onto response profusely thank person digging something positive up, think day, instead tidal wave bad news"" ""Whinging decrying POST BAD NEWS DAY"" ""Some quack thinks illness response demonic interaction said something liked, I'm going her"" ""DON'T SHEEP"" personal favorite ""everything one-sided Trump I'm sick it"". 

I think carts dead neighbors wheeling would photographed strategic angles show old obese people, perhaps one wearing mask would circled red caption ""THEY WORK"".  Others would claim carts CGI ""only one neighborhood"" seen one passed house earlier day.

Yeah one thing put rich shit heads. hand hovered upvote downvote full minute. USL testing fan attendance. I've seen quite social distancing violations, team (Indy Eleven) done great job.  can’t prevent everyone sick.

Kids far likely die flu coronavirus teacher gives one hot shit every fall. Teachers care increases (by trivial amount) *their* risk getting sick, kids’ needs socialization education damned.  big part trouble percentages go, marked uptick usual annual death numbers.

In recent users, approximately 2,800,000 people die annually US.

If COVID-19 deaths US hit 300,000, that's \_at most\_ approximately 10% bump annual deaths. reality significant portion 300,000 deaths expected occurred causes within 12 month period, real elevation deaths likely less 10%.

So individual, average, looks impacts them, small enough number many people (most, fact) experienced additional deaths people close them. pretty good solution parents apply person verification parents working status low risk teachers person classes rest online. they're get around certain classes person (like classes require labs), reduced student body able bring athletes campus. students allowed campus, allowed athletes stay train either.

Everyone keeps telling football every sport lose funding everything. understand football money maker... safety athletes? I'm worried long term health, senior basketball player, seem worth risk future health play one season basketball. Everyone around (coaches, etc) telling play, training like going to. one seems understand still know little virus complications come it.

Why wait spring, potentially vaccine could approved distributed? play football NOW? Can't little patient? Weird. school, opportunity stay home taken. chatted AIM. great culling bikers. type idiots? Apparently type idiots receive Nobel prizes straight fear mongering WHO. Tedros technically right, keep mind vaccines regular influenza, multiple thousands people die every year.

I'm bragging know everything far, I'm trying find info experts try keep family alive, I'm seeing smug laziness, ignorance selfishness around. I'm disgusted, old former hoodrat bad education like it, I'm sure college grad could same. OK. read articles, pictures. seen now, reporter obviously could put count article, even needed hands. see happening either, however either way economy fucked, we're fucked people ignore covid go around spending money, we're fucked people afraid covid stops spending money.

From business perspective, sure, ""the NFL biz like biz"".

But course happens football field like pretty much anything else. COVID-19 gets loose league, going spread like wildfire. getting OBJ? Bring back Caper! Wow! nice virus take break protests! moderate predictions March included would decrease weather got warmer, remember.

Watching Victoria interest right now, seems much harder contain warmer Australia first time around. ""we"" means USA control. countries already opening back up.

I understand fuck wrong people can't stay home month goes away. dems tbqh, act like parties arent giant shitbuckets. 

The fact sides want politicize use vehicle riders disgusting ""Trump comorbidity COVID‑19 pandemic. isn’t solely responsible America’s fiasco, central it.""

Devastatingly accurate. Especially joke majors kids D1 have.

That's problem. can't major something would actually benefit college athletes go pro, demands time ridiculous. Seems like excuse used convince idiots get everyone around infected. percentages mind boggling terrifying. Let's hope get good sample, otherwise... 😬 people don’t virus doesn’t matter. 99%+ socially distant/mask warn interactions couldnt resulted infection, precautions Running clinical trials treatment inherently mean merit efficacy. Many well-controlled studies coming showing meaningful effect recovery COVID-19 patients. clinical trials finished yet piling onto evidence. 

Two three studies enough make conclusion something - need many. article: 

Live people concerns masks talk doctors nearly cases -- even autism, PTSD chronic lung disease -- wearing face covering makes medical sense cause harm.

Jesus we're hell. Lazy-ass reporting. American Academy Pediatrics **clarified one school epidemiologists say so.** Stop repeating Trump lies, NPR. Motorcycles risky form transportation would expect motorcycle riders average take unnecessary risk. metric they're using confirmed cases that's silly. deaths April/may driven NYC, confirmed case count driven largely testing. put another way, even entire country going shit combined couldnt match NYC. mean they're immediate reaction go protest open schools without even wearing masks themselves, really see distinction. probably end better financial position lot NFL burnouts time you’re 30.

By standard? Bc save money? Bc someone life tell em need accountant someone properly managing money?

I make ~30k annually, full-time employee makes ~15$/hr (I'm exactly wage personally, put perspective). That's 1/10 player makes, meaning it'll take 10yrs make makes 1. he'll make 2-3 years what'll take 20-30 current situation. So, ignore taxes &amp; living expenses, assume make entire time &amp; look raw dollars, I'll 60 (I'm 30 btw) time earned money mid-20s.

TBH wages gross every way. perpetuates dream teenagers focus physical abilities skill longer lasting benefits obtain rockstar position. top that, thought good idea give kid kinda money w/o kind mechanism handle.it. great bit heard back Mike Tyson talking heavyweight boxer youth gave kid money &amp; acted surprised stupid stuff. White men I've seen karens male douchebags social media though. 1 place sketchy info widely shared? areas existing Teacher shortage, laying really bad idea, lose many good. Yikes, pretty shit take. Let's assume audience that, people know risks enter ""sport"" hardly see moral argument is. culpable person dying? one chose forgo risk. culpable car crash kills someone? road pavers, tire makers, door installer, car salesman? choose drive, die, everyone involved car making process feel morally responsible?

Also pose stupid example commonly asked philosophical question. agree mental health education every bit important medical education dont know grade school academia gain offering knowledge need life. words, think scam. course, fully agree colleges business fuck ass blind. parts California, ok maybe. Minnesota Wisconsin, think so. Absolutely agree this. Look Asian countries, it’s commonplace generations. you’re sick can’t stay home, courteous. Based reply indication wasn't.  Pools Cinemas shut every Summer years due Polio.  Spanish Flu shutdowns maskwearing even widespread two year period. read saying US worst governed developed nation France second worst (ie. clearly better Congo South Sudan). mention everyone brother hands looking money, guys young learned say friends family. think 65 basically counts pre-existing condition. you’re boat, you’re severe risk act accordingly wait October, 2 - 4 weeks schools across country start opening people really start returning work; compound start flu season recipe disaster. July people starting letting guard down, got complacent chose believe beat virus. States avoided worst initial wave continued go lives, states got hit hard got COVID fatigue let guard down; cases resulted increase infections deaths particularly states avoided worst initial outbreak pushed opening back limited cases protections mask mandates. understand people stay home... hosts funeral... counterintuitive least.

A lifetime cultural standards &amp; training difficult override. That’s went. masks sitting apart. 

It normal-ish, definitely normal. hugs, touching. That's almost four 9/11's every day (2,977 died day). heard ideas definately good. Good thing caught cases school started. much safer start now.. entirely depends live. county, state, laying anyone offering early outs already big Teacher shortage. avoiding furloughs. afraid Teachers return. anyone else straight confused burned this? idea whether things getting better, worse plateaued.

Regardless, alienating actual experts worse us. leader cares people agreeing him. 86 entirely. certainly BIG STICKLERS either. good time son social life important moment. 

Because told parents front wearing masks limo outside would wear went inside store restaurant fine that. 

But people 8 9 different families  true. IMHO need testing need testing RANDOM samples population. Currently people symptoms seeking tests, skews numbers. People symptoms don't' get tested unless work high risk environment. movers shakers decided dont need pretend anymore. anybody else surprised still dont know relatively young healthy athletic people struggle much covid, even die, seniour cancer patients 100 years young veterans get anything sniffle? like thing really scary covid, I, young healthy person hasnt seriously sick 10 years (I never taken sick day work), completely shot covid, possibly even die? hints like blood group, sex, ethnicity, nothing even close telling could get really sick it. Surely infection behaves like this, killing people somewhat random manner (yes old sick people die more, covid much random kill spread like flu, TB even SARS-COV-1 2003). happenings Cobb County Tragic crazy once.  apologize, thought went Denmark high school far away. friends went there. normal graduation ceremony Hmm, sure. want cause argument. wanted point doctor time, former co-workers reported him, post patients journal without consent facebook said would ""microwave phone"" police start investigation misconduct.

Agreed! walking pup cooler night husband could see breath first time covid. husband walking ahead chatting, breath like globulous clouds floating face. mini test ten feet dissipated, 6 feet still walking breath. walking ahead. So, someone walking ahead without mask on, slow pace get path. one pres. kids would school optics bad. Getting pummeled fine, catching deadly virus passing loved ones fine. That's awful. wish could help him. healthcare worker. play video games day. Stfu got nothing worry about. hope you’re right! fear spike deaths resulting new infections happened past 2-3 weeks get us back April numbers period. look like cases decreasing, though, probably deaths trend back quickly even spike coming weeks.  Trump August: ""Birx pathetic."" think Covid spread lot longer countries measures taken, Sweden dragged longer time instead Trump anything provide facade america well, great, give credit. throwing everyone chaos, strongly believes win.  Importantly article claims fatality rates healthy individuals. paper seems mostly based random sampling population, future work section comorbidities, think that's right. Noice. Never stay safe! 🤙💪  look hard unforgiving subsistence agriculture developing nations. Question eat mask? sentence ""American"" ""come thin air"". Every dollar printed dilution dollars already circulation. 

Inflation going ugly - USD already tanking hard.

You cannot print money without consequences (and yes, know done thru bond purchases, actual printing).  coworker thinks it’s hoax Right, millions people gone months without jobs definitely already owe landlord another bill collector $1200. Youth experiences horrible life altering tragedy.

Reporters: better tell everyone world gory details!!!!! moved Johns Creek last year (left state finally) I’m even glad reading wrote COVID-19 virus seems unprecedented spectrum severity, innocuous lethal, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institutes Allergy Infectious virus good enough kill would make almost everybody least little bit sick,"" said, month's first global COVID-19 nature pathogen seem explain person-to-person variability. Among families household, infected virus, people may get profoundly ill—or escape seem matter much virus circulating emerging evidence suggests person's immune response, largely influenced genetics, helps determine severity illness, say infectious disease experts.  know Trump administration's takeover COVID data CDC shady. 

Is indication relative drop daily cases Trump administrations takeover COVID data couple weeks ago related? Correct lose job someone else risk category go lose job parent probably work too.............. Well, America huge whole Europe. manage Germany ~83m people relative dense spread. Compare whole america becomes much dificult. will, stay safe too. Hopefully November good us (November 3rd presidental election.. may already known thought would rude assume do). really hope change future Trump made America great. also wanted say thank you. noticed lot people America really hating Americans since covid. know scared venting I'm person scared too. Thank keeping us thoughts nothing else appreciate it. Agolf Twittler main reason - ever example needed wrong person wrong place time, one. Nashville like great value version Vegas south plus there's chicken places seems slight misunderstanding. good There's money made bringing people false consciousness intentionally. Right?! It’s like random drug test something.  yeah. he's talking ""well-off"" ny people. salary 400-500k basically. reference, 250k considered little average. BA psychology, BA philosophy, electronics technology, graduate school.  theory obviously kids even know much kids see going work well practice. kids small going need someone keep task day. teacher cannot screen. parent going step keep task help get confused, lost etc. 

For older kids, may able handle bit better, still need help parents step in. even teens unmotivated get distracted parent going keep task too. Quite possibly. fairness she/he claimed much. refrained using since made aware it.

Making wonder: big defense Dr Tallinger outed maybe less reputable source. need artificial hearts lungs advance quickly

Not rip people concentration camps China don't! teachers strike? directly - Fauci giving dire predictions Birx giving optimistic ones, indirectly led Fauci getting pushed out.

Birx WAY head smart enough see that. seems fall Trump bullshit quite easily, otherwise come kiddie flowchart non existent testing? Tell press Trump analyzing data - like really? Tell labs make sure enough pipettes?

IMHO history show made bad and/or deceitful decisions part power trip. rest country, Hogan pocket real estate tourism. elected, platform was: force schools open Labor Day tourism season longer. newly compressed school year, winter storms become charlie foxtrot.

He one big project Governor, transportation line north DC. say mismanaged understatement.

Some schools continued program. others Ferguson budget issues can't haul much revenue bogus traffic tickets. That's bad? 

Enjoy fantasy land, kiddo.

Edit: clarity, assertion need prove takes 10 years recover, 'some vague cost' exists. Turns out, right. interview regarding outdoor schooling different climates:

""Definitely. think possible every climate work we're suggesting. great examples Canada northern Scandinavia go outside winter. actually Chicago pandemic 1918, tuberculosis Spanish flu pandemic, go outside even winter schools.""

Ok, I'm new ideas, creativity..whatever...

But where...no, really, outdoors hold school Chicago january? state live in? :X Jesus, 75% positive test rate insane population scale; tell local governments shoot 10% Assuming get paid like UK footballers, I'm sure would fine financially situation. We're doomed... Spanish bulls need practice cause volunteer passengers.

""Imagine lung, bull Covid-19 wall mask decided use."" cases spiking western south dakota, state one lowest rates testing nation. Yet owners take Lion's share money. Guys liked Tom Brady players rich. guys sign paychecks wealthy.

The wealthy letting workers risk lives wealthy get wealthier. That's why. market forces mean salary function much kickers get paid, little many wins provide team. treat kickers disposable, idea why. winningest coach NFL history also coach spends kickers (on average). accident.

Look list highest paid kickers. high correlation teams go - highest paid - Wild Card Runner up
Packers - 2nd highest paid - NFC runner up
Ravens - 3rd - Divisional round runner up
Steelers - 4th - 8-8 missed playoffs
Broncos - 5th - 7-9 missed playoffs
49ers - 5th - Super bowl runner up
Colts - 6th - 7-9 - missed playoffs

Cowboys - 32nd - 8-8 missed playoffs
Bears - 31st - 8-8 missed playoffs
Jets - 30th - 7-9 missed playoffs
Browns - 29th - 6-10 missed playoffs
Radiers - 28th - 7-9 missed playoffs
Chargers - 27th - 5-11 missed playoffs

Eventually NFL whole pick guys salaries skyrocket. winning coaches spend kickers.  *Bill Clinton enters chat* Everyone entitled work life balance.

Stop insisting people overworked. mean bourgeoisie like Marxists mean it, agree you. mean like French define it, I’d say unremitting consumers works better, maybe. Truth half nation growth 1980 2020, least income standard living didn’t improve, maybe even deteriorated (life expectancy went down, exception among rich developed world).

In 2008, even evident government bailout Wall Street Main Street money. bragging amazing recovery financial collapse 2019, exactly decade “ended” 2009, fake recovery many. took worst jobs greater debt. Sure unemployment rate low, filled substandard Uber driver, Amazon warehouse worker type jobs.

With 2020 collapse, bottom 50% stagnates, bottom 75-85%.

The governments recovery policy pump stock market. Good news 1% owns 50% stock market, top 10% owns 92%. 

The rest peasants happy $1200 one time payment alternative, could keep rent cut waaayyy back building maintenance, etc. still get depreciation, etc. Depreciate zero, sell loss, claim capital loss, move on. Happens time tenement building business. Unfortunately. tax code worked. Oh gotcha. Yeah it’s total disaster. ignorance. uncommon multi-generational family homes US (about 20% population it), lot countries that's norm. turns 26% asymptomatic, none died, read entire CDC report lol. 56% got within 10 days. curve ages 7 19 years old. honestly far YMCA camp goes. parents aboard Mexican cruise Gastro-intestinal virus outbreak - maybe norovirus something. basically banned ports spent 2 weeks floating sea breathing air touching surfaces.

How fuck anyone would want go cruise right unbelievable. Oh snap, always amazing see Trumpanzees returning wild, sounding mating call baseless assumptions stomping feet anyone calls out. Nature incredible. Thank you, too. told me, comes waves. trouble breathing, thank god. Yup.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Especially consideration right wing parties/groups heavily present demonstrations. Good luck that. Run along choir practice. right, stats actually crazy athletes finances. 2009 Sports Illustrated article, 35% National Football League (NFL) players either bankrupt financial stress within two years retirement estimated 60% National Basketball Association (NBA) players, 78% NFL players, large percentage Major League Baseball (MLB) players (4x average U.S. citizen) go bankrupt within five years leaving sport.

The 30 30 called ""Broke"" really interesting. Players get paid game, time new season comes around really running money. Can't pass cheap deals. :(   guy openly wondered caught Covid WEARING mask. may gotten stuck somehow that’s exposed me. home qualitative fit test determine efficacy KN95's N95's matter. purchased many batch.

  - Fit mask (use rubber band hair tie connect ear loops KN95's)
  - Attempt blow lighter 4-5 inches front face.
  - smell test saccharin (sweet low).
  - Ensure waterproof, function cup. 
  - Depending mask work ways cup.
  - Tear apart mask layers
  - Ensure melt blown fabric layer get wet.
  - Measure piece melt blown fabric ensure correct GSM mask I'm purchasing.
  - Attempt light melt blown fabric fire, melt burn.

Then depending exact mask confirm layers material expected, non woven polypropylene, hot air cotton etc. mind spending $50 replace sweet low irritant smoke take subjectivity test. 

This 100% flip coin hope best. WTF wrong people? people running boat, willing stuff inside one almost 200 people pandemic. SMH. would imagined illuminati level test everyone works take every morning. kind research waiting for, please!

*rolls eyes rushed vaccines* FDA way understaffed. resources. issue decades. People wanting divided food administration drug administration. litterally read online, amazing people like allowed vote. bible study meet while, started back weeks ago state opened up. really wish even started again, late dwell though. (worldmeters) cite source  fairness stuff recovered started eating properly, managing stress work, sleeping correctly running every morning, dropping coffees dropping sugar.

It's said lot value.

Covid might made people focused bodies feel all. Damn.. future schools open prematurely. 

I wish government people cared public, like fucking hired do. consequences if, warned deadly virus is, governor ignores leads many deaths. Lock dude agree cruise best idea, needs said amount infected Norway low long time, week two ago 3 people hospitals due virus, whole country. police also started investigation seems required pandemic protocols followed crew cruise ship. Awww poor dude🙁🙁🙁 I’m sorry loss article isn’t CTE....... also noted door always closed table outside door pass food/dishes/whatever done them. camp opened June 21st. 100 days Italy shut down, 100 days NBA stopped playing whole world knew terrible deathly pandemic governor Georgia decided roll dice fuckin YMCA sleepover camp? Terrible terrible, terrible. 

Source: I've cut people I'm Canada. Lol HELL taking cruise right now? disease ridden cesspools best times. What's order magnitude friends? think point isn’t much “indoor vs outdoor” much “don’t let appearance things returning normal make forget virus still exists.” Sure, outside definitely better indoors, certian point doesn’t really matter you’re still close proximity lot people. I’m saying *your* opinion, certainly lot people think way. outside isn’t cure-all know. live test unless showing symptoms (usually temperature). person tested positive lost sense smell temperature fatigue able tested. self-isolated case symptoms occur would spread further. contact family members house none exhibited symptoms either. 

Since person exposed pre-symptomatic viral shed rate high. person tested positive sister, contracted exhibited symptoms within 2-5 days. 

Maybe 2 friends caught asymptomatic viral load low would make difficult others catch. seems according statistics one us developed symptoms, none us super mild strain. Well clearly forgetting part contracts clearly states play pandemics. KNEW SIGNED FOR! Holy shit. published March. resp tech knew exactly coming. No, need money, need better way life it? schools lake county indiana planning it. said theyworked hvac company adjust everything ensure room would get fresh air 3 6 times per hour. opening anymore many stupid parents keep saying delay 4 weeks valid reason. school decided go online only.

These delays nothing. open 4 weeks, nothing changes. Either procedures school good enough not. not, still close 3 weeks people start getting sick. good, stay open, making previously 4 week delay complete joke. argument cheap, rapid, less accurate tests catch cases difficult get test all, time get results back probably infectious phase anyway. honestly lot typical pandemic level viruses people realize. Think Asian flu. Hell swine flu? combination t-cell immunity and/or risk-factors. Yeah, would. get underlying sentiment can't lock down, shut various businesses, etc. economic damage event catastrophic. said, wearing masks opening equally terrible, probably so.

 Let people going do, require masks. seems simple. this, could likely keep hospitals filling. Couple online education year vaccine developed (hopefully), OK.

That may others feel, acknowledge many want complete shutdown, understand.  also socialist. Like bailing corporations banks instead paying people short-term UBI (saw reason given support argument US becoming communist and/or socialist nation.) really interesting basically rules British Columbia- though shut much Sweden ever (closed schools, closed indoor dining ~2 months, among things)- quite well even reopening majority things (though school still largely online fall). Masks aren’t mandatory, large Asian population problem masks plenty people wear well. really think biggest factors keeping people congregating indoors, limiting size groups (it’s recommended 6 people “bubble” outside family/people house), social distancing. compare metrics- population province 5 million, we’ve 3,641 confirmed cases 195 deaths. worked ER Brooklyn hospital. refrigerator semi truck. one filled up, get second one. got hit pretty hard Urhurhurhur mean list dangerous jobs goes on... I’m talking covid19 I’m strictly referring CTE comment. mean boxing ufc sports rely people losing consciousness nfl health risk boogeyman? far covid players can’t stay safe reduce risk spreading around cancel plan better. NBA bubble seems working! NFL much much larger staff though bubble may work. think I've seen video someone using filled balloon pass one these. sure made up, memory reason LOL Many large retailers Manhattan pay $1M month rent. I'm pretty sure job close that. insane. Texas' revenue $200 million/year primarily football pays almost sports.  donations asking alumni donate right purchase football tickets - think college equivalent personal seat license. huge endowment (second Harvard) ton tied oil &amp; gas, likely illiquid right anyway. Aww. sad. hadn’t made billions billions past years. Heartbroken, truly. hand sanitizers end market begin with? Brilliant. Thank sharing me. I'm saving this. new theology all. Everything you’ve said tied Calvinism well almost always influence American Christianity  Ironically, coronavirus ended fixing really serious issue that's plaguing commercial spaces (and started moving residential rentals) years.

Basically, lot owners would post absurdly high rent, literally sit retail space, refusing take lower offers, make modifications, etc

Literally sitting empty spaces waiting ""the right customer"". Sometimes years even!

There's YouTuber named Louis Rossman experienced first hand scouting new space Apple laptop repair business New York City. 

This common widespread ended inflating cost commercial rental spaces, despite fact (especially California) WAY commercial space zoned residential. Hell, cities like Huntington Beach EXCLUSIVELY zoned commercial decade! Zero residential zoned, commercial! 

And yet, despite glut commercial space, prices kept going up.

Looks like trend finally corrected. already learned walk twice, third time lol possible showing positive dead virus that's they're asking get retested yeah sick 103.5 fever almost two weeks can't exactly get get retested moment. every single ""model"" never comes anywhere close predicting future.

Right? keep thinking tomorrow (August 4) supposed day US reached 60k dead. Even back saying longest time, beyond obvious (to anyone without blinders on) estimate waaaaayyyy low. decision White House everything needed open, get economy going again. Nobody questioned it. Well say that, true respects, recall covid began crashing market, fed pumping 75 billion dollars per day market promising ""unlimited quantitative easing."" money basically come thin air, tune 75 billion coming thin air per day.

With number, could instead given every American adult 2500 bucks *per week*, instead 1200 one time 6-7 months. I'm saying everyone getting 10,000 per month, 1500 could easily done. Instead ""thin air"" money went propping market keep rich (people large stock holdings) rich wash hands. Oh Lord. Yeah definitely culture shift need have. work floor definitely see pattern ED chooses drug screen, know mean. We're even halftime yet baby. countries flat lines right US going up, up, up.  right tweeting TV network ratings 

Not show event particular, TV ratings NBC, Fox CNN 

Because millions brink eviction poverty, thousands dying everyday pandemic, everyone kinda losing sight thats TV ratings really important It’s eight days now, still positives Everything I've ever read says specific, severe, manipulation tactic utilized abusive relationships.  Like husband manipulates wife believing everything fault, worthy treated better, needs distanced family friends, misdeeds actually misdeeds products failures, etc.

In last year two, definition expanded relationship component required more. lying lot thing, like said.  Though I've heard used even broadly that, term used describe lie. also contrary political opinions generally (which may feel like ""lies"" hold opinion).

The interesting thing ""why"" word embraced last year two.  Surely lies, even repeat lies, long that. think something kind vague term people share consistent definition of, way hanging insult longer.  call liar, kind know means, special power term. call - maybe I'm right, maybe I'm venting, maybe I'm liar.  call oil swimmer, steam floater, kind win debate get sound hip modern 100% clear everyone I'm accusing of, quick response. Interesting thanks, could need patients. seen mentioned though. ridiculous. fuck paying then? August school normal States? Canada, first day school always Tuesday Labour Day. even though kids school since March, that's they'll try starting year, too. Even so, there's lot trepidation, even though province 15 million getting 150 new infections per day; lot parents keeping kids home regardless. would like point initial post, said US country telling truth numbers, deleted.

Again, analysis borne out, fact completely contradicted, facts mentioned. facts are, unsurprisingly, little nuanced bizarre Speed Racer cartoon vision reality - much hard understand obviously cartoonishly wrong. seem missed every single one them, go again:


US undercounting, relative excess deaths, similar degree UK, Spain Italy. 

Whereas Sweden Ireland Belgium, covid count excess death count almost identical, course places like NZ Australia much East Asia measurable excess deaths even compare.

The worst undercounting appears happening developing nations like Brazil, Mexico, Iran, South Africa, Ecuador, Peru, etc, excess deaths appear well twice three times official Covid counts.

How US official Covid counts relate excess deaths particularly special, spite protests. I’ve stopped washing hands stuff, wash things want clean hands like picking nose. Huge decrease frequency required that. way kids school safely right now. Period. amount money change that. major league baseball can't operate safely, schools zero chance 
 
Save money keep kids home. kind thing. working medium sized non-profit three women babies. Next thing know. new health insurance $8,000 deductible. offered HSA could save ahead pay medical care never reached deductible amount. Well politicized pushing Fauci out, questioning CDC public, touting presidents attention detail, actually anything besides provide color commentary virus. goes around comes around nba players value bodies invest themselves, behooves trust science biology trust doctors see often. could distribute money government systems place figure needs money ability distribute it. Collecting redistributing funds government actually does. would take millionaires long time get information put process place get funds proper outlets. Plus would lose substantial amount money talking time make happen. hard government sort willing so. likely patches gum. problem, IMO, linguistic one: ""immune"" entered social lexicon *functionally mean* ""safe from"" contexts disease. problem gets used talk disease. guess what’s interesting though 250,000 dead fraction population, nothing would make seem scary really is. That’s it’s important look fact it’s death it’s long-term health complications appear affecting large percent covid patients. supposed profit hydroxychloroquine stockpiles now? condoms 100% effective, right?  sub reddits seeing stuff on? Seems pretty much opposite here. got close NY/NJ. One nursing home NJ like 15 bodies stored shed. 



*before someone notes confirmed, found bodies empty room Sheriff's office got there, I've worked industry frequently delt place. 100% sure bodies shed. would residents laying floor walk around ... ""hey uh theres old guy ground miss"" ""oh yeah know always fall lat stay dont fall"". luck shit life hard time caring this. Isn’t “miracle” new daily cases trended downwards ever since HHS got involved? Man, beginning. wouldn’t pandemic now. mean Woodrow Wilson bit prick put mildly. simply Trump. Responding another comment. christian nationalism. entitled people think whatever want without regard people. Yep. Anyway, thanks conversation, nice day! I'm going go take walk sun :) Agree it’s serious, point complaints don’t really make sense. don’t want play, don’t play, right? What’s point complaining option Odell precisely thinks happen (and player same) testing finally improved? Birx finally found soul, miss sunny optimism months. course president criticizing speaking truth. Yeah but... know nuances either. I've listened evolutionary biologists virologists talk viruses adapt applied situation hand. Anyone able that. Well yes, one day May everyone decided pandemic over?  bought £25 one Amazon pretty good. question is, hell blood? Well specialist viruses, anything like that. active within social science field. understanding people social distancing. start using masks worry stop keeping distance least 2m start moving closer other. combination touching faces removing mask public might increase virus spread. 
So sort of.... think working want jinx it. swedes might disagree interpretation though. lot primary care doctors I’ve met would get annoyed ask questions. like look stuff Mayo Clinic website possible diagnoses health visit general idea could questions ask. one particular lady call “dramatic” asked seeing gastroenterologist said better skinny (I lost 20 pounds two months) fat like last patient. 

Point being... it’s always patient’s fault. Sometimes doctors assholes don’t take time actually listen patients. you’ve doctors like entire life... yeah you’re gonna bad health literacy. believe this, live teeny tiny lump rock holds 1/6th worlds wealth given day. many, many anonymous benefactors stepping forward offering resources fund bring ventilators, PPE, everything needed. I’ve also heard offered ‘Covid’ payments local government proviso that’s used purely benefit residents. Don’t want pay actual tax hey, better nothing....

I value every comment see countries surprised insane healthcare, education, lack maternity leave, etc. know things are, good reminded, also many realize things.

Part getting things change realizing could fact better, better places. One, they’re reconsidering recommendation. cause haven’t mandated it, certainly recommending social distancing.  fact, workers airports train stations mandated wear them. make clear, defending plan Sweden has. I’m saying is, plan implementing it. totally different US (or say, capable current leadership).

I care anyone else says. Pelosi got started talking bout wear/don't wear mask, take/don't take HCQ, whatever.. think rational people going give shit? No, aren't. They're going ask doctors follow think.

If someone elderly, at-risk, wants cautious wear mask. want to, won't. tell someone lives urban area... people everywhere walks life wearing it.

It’s super socially distant, least be.  aren’t facts lmfao don’t proof, it’s assumption. fair I’m making assumptions mine based logic, news us wants trump appear handled Covid poorly won’t re-elected. 

You don’t even mention US hospitals offered money Covid related deaths CARES act. Even incentive US report. countries want save face admit it! us overreporting things like media CARES act Singapore, Israel, South Korea - name few.  good ones do, bad bartending? hoping compare backalley unaccredited doctors? entry level software engineer?

Yeah democrats elected wrong candidate that. We’re gonna waste this.  write *hastily written complaint*.  Except MLB anything special keep safe. boggles mind. Ok, looks like remembering reddit comment week know make it. comments mention higher normal stillbirths, anecdotal. Anyway would helpful know reported stats control that. Hello! Thank you!!!! wear pants work also sounds pretty badass lol Retail stores need zero tolerance crazy behavior (as schools). 

No shirt, manners, service. haven’t ever call fire department 30 years. Where’s tax refund? 

See stupid ""Ah, yes, 'ath-oh-letes.' ;)"" friend managed busy Starbucks Chicago, rent $30k month. can’t believe locations go much. interpret .1% death rate incredibly low. small number. Well, reframe number say 60m people die worldwide, rings different.

Case point everyone bad math: .1% death rate equals 7 million people, 60 million (there 7 billion people planet, decimal). yet... I’m doctor. Always careful, probably safe. breaks heart. link go fund me? Yes, airborne AIDS. New cases fell 5%, testing fell 6%. Testing COVID-19 fell 6% United States last week, first decline since late May, according data COVID Tracking Project, volunteer-run effort track outbreak. 

Just things make go, Cases rose week-over-week 20 states, including Oklahoma cases risen nine weeks row, Montana cases eight straight weeks, Missouri infections risen seven weeks. 

It really seem like decline new cases result strain testing facilities materials. opt out. choosing play decides Lock  10s millions infections worldwide point.

Please keep mind, so-called Spanish Flu 1918 ""mother"" yearly seasonal influenza viruses ever since. likely needing yearly vaccinations Covid related viruses well, years come re-infections. probably restraining order two issued her. WoULd kEeP It?! BrOkEn!!! xD oook say face? think so, came people dark complected, olive skinned dark hair. bet looks nothing like think. Mother 10! Good lord. messengers virus gods, spreading Covid gospel would otherwise deny it. really, Testing COVID-19 fell 6% United States last week, first decline since late May, according data COVID Tracking Project, volunteer-run effort track outbreak. 

Possible decline cases due drop testing got argument anti-masker thinks masks effective would actually spread disease faster. claim people always touching manipulating mask. wearing mask COVID positive, infected droplets would quickly drop ground due heavier surrounding air molecules. wear mask, infected droplets end onto mask. person touches mask gets onto hand touch surfaces. virus spread areas infect others instead sinking ground. think completely misunderstanding situation really know enough science give strong coherent explanation. Right? wear masks don’t distance it’s pointless. like protests. Someone’s gonna duck mask eventually see time chin nose fact surgical mask screaming yelling five inches someone else’s mouth nose. Ridiculous. Yeah. pragmatic. would selling land back state? professors admin would immediately welcomed state union? students would broken sent public schools respective areas? teachers built salaries years teaching institutions would looking new jobs? talking schools here... talking almost 35,000 schools. 

You make sound like retrofitting pizza hut Chinese Food restaurant. almost middle aged used extremely idealistic. Everything simple moral solution hard see anything possible. might call cynicism, others pragmatism, see things way anymore. recognize cause effect small changes have. Big changes like one speaking pretty far reality. Seven states refused lock down. heard lot exponential case spread death count. 

I presume that's happening?

Right?

Someone? told know based work handles it. Instead smart ass don’t enlighten us correct information seem possess, know, add discussion instead merely acting better all.

Also it’s HIPAA, “HIPPA” call it. kids Georgia camp definitely didnt catch anything. Yep. I’m telling anything.

People way smarter telling us.  They're misinformed. see sports testing players say, ""oh *they* get tests 
ordinary people dont"" reality sports leagues spending millions private tests keeping bubble. nope, sports bad. cases cut half where? guess full evaluation labs chest x ray. time, things looked okay. give medications symptom control. make clear return feel like worsening. Yeah, great knock-on effects, one key element increasing number people housing market first place; describe happen frequency. 

If policy focused creating first time home owners, rest follow, policy attempts improve housing market without focus might open market way leaves homeownership reach many. first one even week multiple teachers out. hell think teaching classes right now? case ""everyone this"". data manipulation. Take Florida example. excess pneumonia related deaths probably higher COVID-19 deaths include probable cause death. That's undercount, problem official cause death vs probable cause death. Something get rectified CDC later year long estimate. Iran facing issue. listed cause death straight changed official reported number half value. Agree. also think picture honest way would difficult words. shows people avoided hot sunlight seating area opted instead couple shade trees behind benches. photographer wanted dishonest, could chosen angle showed stage 5 people actually sitting benches. psychiatric consequences COVID-19 caused immune response virus

Despite stories make news, statistical odds young healthy athletic person getting hospitalized/dying covid incredibly low, odds 100 year old cancer survivor totally unaffected. NY pretty good data this, people 30 account 0.4% total deaths (110 25,000+ confirmed deaths). That's basically rounding error, especially considering much people 30 outnumber 90, account 14% deaths (over 3,500).

Any data set millions outliers, took look diseases similar chance killing young healthy person list would long scared forever coincidence shape New Jersey looks like giant arm pit, Florida looks like flaccid dick. fed's putting money stock market, quite accurate indicator. stock market also reactionary news, too. quick figures:

This would legitimate concern virus primarily spread via surfaces. But, since March lot research two general things I've seen almost spread person-to-person contact, masks work even medical grade. believe due virus particles lasting long outside human body. look mask studies Covid-19 find bunch. revenue Billion dollars. 

Luckily, pay players. Kohl’s credit card ask cashier coupon give random one scratch off. 15-30% usually. looks don’t think Donald liked answer. Sounds like keep wearing much facial covering can, keep washing hands, crack harder large amounts people gathering indoors. I'm confused I've reading aerosols, etc. months thought already knew airborne, hence 100 percent guarantees. Every time Trump speaks, meme pops head guy like ""Some may die that's sacrifice I'm willing one! even kind looks like Trump... BORTLES! noticed morning, yesterday sliced cases 47,000; evening, world-o-meters reporting 33,000?

This probably one two things, either backlog testing, people finally listening, starting see signs things slowing BIT. time keep wearing masks, distancing, hand washing sanitizing, cut 33,000 half. Good. Unpopular opinion: Professional sports colossal waste human time, energy, space, carbon budget never justifiable. setback welcome, overdue. 

Amateur sports fine personal exercise course immensely valuable. Rural areas retail apocalypse, there's little options going department store still beats online delivery time far enough out. ""another"" lockdown? ""a"" lockdown. We’ve cautiously opening phases two months now. Look NY covid numbers, graph flat since beginning June. polar opposite Florida. Congratulations sanctimonious jerk! Ah yes, old argument people responsible actions, Trump made infect tens thousands people protesting. Trump made kill 30 people counting rioting. 

Take responsibility least. Google micron size cv micron size n95 material. taxes paid ~20 years ago doctors nurses treat today. What's funny actually read article would find says virus may spread protests. say thing protesting about.

It says overall infection rate cities protests go cases slightly declined. 

They believe result everyone else taking holiday due protests. protest 20,000 people caused 100,000 stay home would normally out. virus spread protest, side effect protests keeping people home. pay taxes Trumpster? NPR hire write articles. u elaborate? Well too, won't. Try telling macho man randy savage go doctor. Mr ""if get corona, get corona"".

The kids going back school enough ignite reinfection wave. Absolutely true!

You don’t see anyone Satanic Temple getting COVID-19 you? Guys, can't anymore. can't. one calmest patient people, I'm reaching breaking point. decision-makers terrible trying sensible?  wouldn’t nice. Doomers They’re counting thanks antimaskers yourself. This. 

Look, whenever administration basically, well, anything, question motives assume something shady going on, this. 

That said, thing consistently gotten lost hysteria switch states reported numbers CDC, way around. still true, except fact hospitalization numbers going DHS. 

As far know, every state still maintains numbers reporting dashboard. changing. 

So, yeah, maybe take DHS reported hospitalization numbers grain salt, nothing's stopping going state(s) interest directly looking numbers, come federal government. Oh yeah I'm always best, guy needed mask could read lips probably grossest dirtiest lake state. Geared towards younger people partying. live Kansas City lived Tablerock years much nicer choice anyone actually wants swim fish. Nah. Duggars. That's messed up. trying return item didn’t her..? I’d seriously love see stupid she’d look court explaining side things see either/or proposition. Safety, general, work place priority. isn't, swift action taken via robust worker protection laws. right... teachers parents think prioritizing in-person schooling.

In cases, REAL reason ""work"" obsessed culture U.S. case NFL, profit owners people saying players babies deadly virus could cut short ability provide and/or others get cause decided play. teachers, BIG reason obsession reopening in-classroom learning cause ""parents need go work"".

Yeah... could first make sure make choice, set system prioritizes health safety profits. could least entertain ideas never good ole USA.

But we're really talking ""work"" obsessed all. we're really talking about, PROFIT obsession. worst thing world happen, apparently, ask benefitted America's corporate tax largesse/autonomy, give back time like make sure get together ALIVE much possible. There's small percentage benefit rest country ""work"" obsessed. ""family"" obsessed even saying here. tell someone ""I'm obsessed spending time kids/wife/husband/parents, whatever"", look like nuts probably also believe lazy. person take paid vacation days sick days looked like kind working class hero, go-getter - direct odds pretty much everywhere else world seemed realize even MOUNTAINS evidence says rest recharging time spent loved ones actually INCREASES beloved productivity.

The problem is, things eroded much possible last 40-50 years. Instead like many first world countries, society FIRST place live provides certain services/infrastructure well-being/protection citizens, SECOND, place businesses granted right business country's citizens, U.S. backwards. Here, FIRST place corporations thrive whatever need order profit SECOND, place citizens given precious right work corporations (or public entities) risk. dumb enough pandemic summer camp = dumb enough wear masks Man know I've said thing past couple weeks, I'd love feed plants gatorade Terry Crews president. rich high places gives lot sway people.

Tennessee|2,241|6.628m|338.111 hope. beat this. It’s question long. Noticing myself. optimist wants say recent mask requirements many previously non masked states actually stopping spread virus. However pessimistic part saying it’s reporting issue. 47,000 new cases yesterday, it’s month since low. Deaths also quite low well. Uuuuhhhh... messed up.

From another article, cause I'm location restricted one:

Conveniently leads sick individuals spreading virus realize sick. think seeing really bad ground glass opacities claim asymptomatic. pneumonia. feel pain. dig virus brains sinister gets.

The analgesia study released last week. Done University Arizona remember correctly. Fed responsible fiscal stimulus, that’s Congress. Fed calling fiscal stimulus Congress since Covid tacitly endorsed Democrat’s $3T bill. problem Fed’s instruments well suited getting money working class people. aren’t allowed give grants, Congress Treasury that. aware fact Congress doesn’t pass big stimulus plan, force Fed fill void another huge relief bill aimed businesses. exacerbate wealth inequality, something Fed saying since Covid.

That happened private clinic Ah. Well answer yet, suspect that’s is. 

Side note: love username! got 2 corgis. looking excess deaths, Belgium worst Europe afaik Interesting, conclude:

- Protests little effect spread COVID- 19.

- Reduced social distancing protesters outweighed increased social distancing people avoiding protests. people BLM protests UK wearing masks. Perhaps.

But conversely, lot countries *officially* behind US might higher deaths per capita account shitty reporting government lies. Brazil probably does. bet Mexico Iran higher death rates (Iran caught lying numbers yesterday). there's way hell Ecuador 325 per million. reality probably three times higher case. habitual.

But already given two links obviously false claims.

Of course scientifically accurate statement might something something indeed exist, pretty doomsday sounding go way has. think amount cases explained this. lot people sub report ""spacing out"" ""struggling focus"" sick 1-2 weeks coronavirus...but see particularly alarming. away studying/working weeks try jumping right back immediately, going easy going struggle.

Sounds like made out. literature study coordinated Karolinska Institutet McMaster University Canada shows mouth protection made fabric provides filtering clinical level, reduce spread viruses sars-cov-2. results, published Mayo Clinic Proceedings, support use mouth guards reduce spread new coronavirus, according researchers.

\- direct evidence oral protection reduces transmission sars-cov-2 would require randomized clinical trial would unethical perform. literature found clearly shows face masks reduce spread viruses protect carriers, effectively. evidence sufficient recommend use face masks, especially given difficulty controlling ongoing pandemic, says [Juan Jesus , professor epidemiology [Department Medical Epidemiology , Karolinska Institutet. 

The research group found 25 published articles compared filtering properties fabric face masks different designs different materials. tests behind different articles done different ways different methods, made difficult compare. studies followed medical standards exist certify protective equipment care. Despite this, results show certain face masks fabric significantly reduce spread particles environment reduce amount particles inhaled, researchers say. 

## Multiple layers work better

\- may seem illogical woven fabric, space threads visible naked eye, block particles small aerosols, data clearly show case. Even single layers block certain particles several layers work better. assessment use face masks key component reducing spread covid-19, line current recommendations US CDC, says Juan Jesus Carrero.

The research group published commentary *Annals Internal Medicine* late May recommending use face masks general public. time, researchers emphasize importance continued good hand hygiene, social distancing disinfection public areas.

That's convenient... declaration NFL schools gonna shut weeks naiive.

The irony calling something naive... Maybe said lol. suppose mask emoji changed interpretation. time another flu-like virus serious issue. viruses become less lethal time. ""The what?"" important parts entire article are:

""But strategy also resulted **Sweden one highest death rates world**, [56.4 per **and it’s unclear whether economy fare much better neighboring Denmark Norway**, initially imposed strict lockdowns seen substantially lower fatalities.""

So, strategy resulted highest death rate Europe (and one highest world) unclear benefits economy. Great strategy... talking about? Stop throwing strawmen admit fact idea fiscal conservatism powered taking house 2014 later coopted Trump 2016 largely abandoned. reduced taxes increasing military budget nearly $800b. Punitive action China necessary, way Trump went resulted close $30b handed farmers Trump's executive agencies, circumventing congress' control taxpayer money outlined constitution. direct increase executive power republican held House fell reach. conservative, plenty find wrong administration without Trump hater. hate false equivalence. protested several times BLM San Jose almost everyone wore masks people passed hand sanitizer. pretty much stay quarantined otherwise. face face unmasked conversation anyone wife since March. 

Shit, seen people blame protests LA shitty California made dipshits go out.

If dipshits going places, hanging inside, wearing masks, getting corona, people responsibly protested white supremacy, fault lies dipshits.

I think people really wanted blame protests statistics showed otherwise, shifted narrative. Also, two doctors family (both 'överläkare') think masks ridiculous, 'because everyone get anyway'. believe wrong, indeed common professional view within health care. think Jesus *WAS* white. one disagrees far see comments right would able pay college education without athletic scholarship. Growing up, knew perform athletically wanted college paid for.

These athletes work hard, deserve right keep scholarships receive backlash wanting protect deadly virus unknown long term complications. Sure, quit, deserve lose hard-earned scholarship concerned safety. professional athletes. treated like lives matter, need entertain universities make millions. joke know way many people 110% believe either leave alone die - spend last moments risk fuck wrong people What’s point? Chinese virus offensive right Probably pandemic poor preparation country.

Your claim businesses closed keep hospitals intact results hospitals closing hold water. happened country businesses closed, beurocratic incompetence. Game changing therapies far short mid term change math approach activities virus vaccine (which mid/long term).

Lots good news lately expected approval applications within month (this, REGN-COV2, nebulized interferon B, etc.). therapies could lower Tha fatality rate, downright squash it. even severe cases covid resulting 3-5 day stay hospital few, any, deaths, completely changes math think things like schooling etc.

Will take combination things, vaccine, social distancing, masks, hygiene finally eliminate disease, hopeful several really promising therapies end loss life take stress medical community. good boy🤪 generally thought less accurate, though reports disagree exact figures are. Overall she’s handling pretty well, feel her. part always wonder able get care needed things would different. People
Are
So
Dumb does, outright deny constantly downplay problems. terrible person. Go Pirelli Dang people pretty downvote happy last couple days Source? That's factor think bigger reasons drop weekend closure public testing sites due Isaias.

Edit: regard drop positive tests. already huge community transmission late February Stockholm. late March, probably already starting go since measures put place mid-March pretty immediate effect seen hospitalizations death peaking mid April. yeah, stories people increasingly visiting care homes ban even sneaking in/climbing windows ban wild me. state well, model rest states came testing. happened?! Outside transmissions masks negligible none data supports statement Good luck mom, I'm sorry hear Nah hurricane. Alot testing sites close alot state run labs closed well. thats another way saying general population US extremely stupid, thats well known fact anyways go cruise. Cheap, already covid. Perfect vacation. think like here? dead bodies stacked streets? Yes places hit hard, exactly managed correctly, we're sick dying here. all. see copers. need people working kids school want chance reelection. Two months school make big difference. :(  end year anticipate approval least one vaccine. also expect people vaccinated end year.

Keep mind people vaccinated Phase 3 trial right now. inside house ?? You’re assuming public transportation primary driver spread NYC, don’t think know that. NYC hit early, guidance masks, distancing, indoor spread still figured out. Restaurants bars probably shut earlier. lot nursing home spread. Etc. people cities wearing masks, gathering large groups, mixing households indoors (at restaurants, bars, offices, whatever) it’s surprising cases increasing. you’re hanging bunch people restaurant, that’s potential problem whether drove took bus! bus certainly increase number people come contact with, especially people talking and/or it’s jam-packed, understanding restaurant likely source infection. hindsight swine flu actually serious. 200 000 500 000 people died. Among many children! 

This virus worse least children dying it.
Let's hope covid19 mutate like Spanish flue becomes lethal children well...

I think China repeatedly pointing countries possible new viruses counter accusations lately China source epidemics. truth viruses thrive anywhere lots people China, trough fault own, quite lot. seriousness registered certainly reacted draconian enough. Preach it. democracy unlike russia china, yet still consider heroes invading third world countries oil conclusion pretty dramatically overstated. idea income families is, babysitters available them, work home, kids even need supervision. words, comment obviously invalid require statistics refute. Guys, guys, fine. vote R, fuck 'em, amiright?

I'm patriot views! really scary consider massive wave homeschooling thats incoming too. things going get worse get better world already feeling turmoil Conservative ""revolution"" guys implemented. Also suggested response scenario current president refuses leave. course action could take scenario?

Your country began revolution tyranny. need fix it.. yes agree voting step #1, goes beyond that, hope collectively fatalistically resign fate make bunch memes. Yes. Recent German study showed 80% infected, including mild asymptomatic heart inflammation remained viral clearance. reference, seasonal flu max 10% patients get inflammation.

Edit. [""Look dat boy mind -Joby Loonie @ beach"" teenager die. Checkmate anti-back schoolers. virus known cause coagulation problems people. People milling outside way indoor attractions. think they’ll spending time Disney standing concrete baking sun? original concept “letting place residence you’re gone spare room aren’t using.” pretty nice AirBnB. took five seconds big investors gobble property pretty much function unlicensed hotels. 
We ballot item tax short-term rentals differently city (Jersey City) AirBnB constantly ran attack ads featuring “some poor soccer mom needed rent property make ends meet.” 
The people promoting ballot measure needed post single graph showing “fraction short-term rental units” vs “unique owners” increasing number units owned. forget exact numbers, vast majority AirBnB units owned entities also owned something like *ten* units (some entities owning dozens). 
Soccer moms indeed... math. apartment 1,200 sqft. store size would cost $800,000 month rent? flagship stores Nike? Jesus christ People downvoting you, world masks preventative measure, social distancing actually works halting spread virus, insane think U.S. multiple massive protests many states **at time** keep virus control. worry, White House directly controls reporting data numbers improve dramatically pandemic disappear time! I've reading books parenting modern age. suggests kids days lot anxious depressed (in America least) less independent/ capable taking care themselves/ less control lives. really think parents best thing you. silly, learn dishes 18 years old. think generational cultural shift. watched show compared typical New Zealand family Japanese one. Japanese child navigated train system school themselves, New Zealand children driven. think is, child young America would police called tried get train themselves. norms protect child strangers. That's crazy, might work! Vanity Fair article correct. exactly trying do.

Edit: Vanity Fair article. anyone wondering numbers low...

The weekend plus tropical storm/hurricane caused alot testing sites close...plus alot labs shut down, death certificates signed weekend..

The weekends already slow kind stuff add hurricane mix gets even slower even inaccurate results. 

More likely huge back log posted cases deaths shock anyone. nothing value lost people wanna run around protesting ignoring social distancing guidelines It’s almost like protesters wore masks.

That's probably part it, also remember protests weeks earlier virus restrictions major sources spread either people wearing masks far less (though virus probably less prevalent community point things opening more). bigger factor think protests outdoor areas. That’s making whiskey wastewater analysis ideally publicly available responsible way publish analysis first complete it. Publishing phase II results lead major healthcare fallouts — 25-30% phase III trials actually succeed phase II. Remember goals phase II vs III different: II ideal conditions III real life conditions. spot needle went slightly sore days that’s it, maybe slightly less energetic well nothing crazy Number tests last 7 days: 5.7M

Number tests 7 days that: 5.8M

It also 5.8M week that, too. hell testing going time like this? hate jump America sucks bandwagon, JFC.

On bright side, positive test percentage slowly going down. Here's tend last 4 weeks: 8.6%, 8.2%, 8.0% 7.7%. Retail clothes. Even every garment made poor country means people abused there. died unrelated causes testing positive. stonks go $27.99 hat??? That's works. people never complained people gathering ""protest"" opening things up. hear vitriol voices mention BLM protests. Yes, gaslighting another word form lying. ""we"", assume means college football players collectively mind regards safety playing pandemic.

Edit: ""being gaslit"" context means someone attempting gaslight them. Right, people looking horror city ~500 positives day?

if 500 horror, wtf x100 USA records daily? thats 'good' day. Yes, time Biden’s public option take high risk, sick people affected pandemic thrown insurance $$ Maybe professionals delivered information via angry redneck pickup truck Wal Mart parking lot mouth breathers would finally listen. It's...not? guys crazy thinking that's crazy. Realistically good idea let mail sit days, there's downside it, safety issue. Fomite spread real, even seems relatively small portion total spread events. Anything beyond waste time, unlikely CV19 survive longer days surfaces like potentially infective concentration... also difficult, obtrusive, costly harmful wait longer. sits? downside think bill might late he's getting paper bills. overly unnecessarily cautious, barely approaches ""crazy"". 

People unnecessarily cautious things life time blend easily what's acceptable culture, example, coworkers urban, trust raspberries right bush. limited knowledge, that's ""outside"" potentially dirty. happen know foods available store touched hands potentially infective surfaces berries bush clean, think coworkers ""crazy"" background limits knowledge one specific area and, without ability certain something safe, choose abundance caution. That's rational decision, information given. lack balance annoying. get titers every year make sure still immunity get dose needed. always get influenza vaccine yet I'm monster I'm worried covid vaccine rushed Hopefully COVID gets America stop glorifying cult leader start addressing problem. Yeah there’ll new outbreak. Dorms last place wanna spend quarantine in. could easily allergies happens times year (makes sound seasonal). pretty much constantly one going garbage sinuses. 


Practice usual precautions always act like could infect people. begin showing symptoms contact doctor. Yeah, want badly US fail.

I'm boat. personally know 1 individual virus. hardly call something ""crippling"" America. 

This tragic situation, we're still here, honestly want live anywhere else. 

It's tragic situation, politics pretty messed up, think country ""defeated"" this. Cool another effective test Americans won’t ever get Yes. That's exponential growth works. Every day worse previous day. like office space. Every day get go live worst day life. see white house good job cleaning numbers. work health statistics company, US.  lot work ongoing look overall trends causes deaths. # Deaths top 10 causes actually surprisingly similar almost predictable year year - sudden spike dip category telling. 

In countries processes centralized reporting health care outcomes. 

From within industry, heard governments institutions adjusting cause death, (funnelling Covid cases top 10 ‘underlying conditions, counting non COVID deaths COVID) depending funded, delaying reporting central authorities counting, delaying reports public, limiting test availability avoid surpassing threshold would result public measure setback. institution business wants report source outbreak. 

They awhile eventually data causes collected evaluated look like last years year before. 

It take years months fully see impacts. COVID outcomes causes death increased loads health care due complications delays service.  It’s true, OP bullshitter. read thread. OP publicly flogged sharing CM TV (like Sun). congrats piece land live atm achieving simple goal first time forever. I'm guessing working retail get decent sampling community me, 50% customers wear masks 10-20% hostile idea it. Idiocy common widespread, although I'm thankful there's amount decent people left wonder enough. What’s point comments besides karma farming? offers nothing. You’re changing anyone’s mind subreddit, generally page comes virus. defeated Good, let happen thrived Italy clearly bullshit. school system grew spent end last school year delivering food kids. Instead picking kids used resources take kids food. They're track go back school month. see happens.

As far education goes, I'd say test kids go back need repeat grade person. ideal actually think graduating year later sort death knell. outside circumstances.

As far kids unsafe environments, can't much that. However, that's true every night kid home, every weekend, every holiday, every summer break. almost like sort safety net schools. lucky enough get shingles years ago 30s. fun. errbody generators. know they'd hook keep truckin. I've taking vitamin supplement years, due mostly indoors taking medication makes susceptible sunburn (and terrible allergies), good hear something else good! It’s inaccurate, nothing see here. do, next year you’ll compete plus newcomers admission. 

It’ll difficult get in. Japan it, well.

Enjoy fear mongering. Kind weird marches big cities yet increase virus. 

The south exploded covid, NYC didn't. partied Florida without masks, protestors wore them. Yeah SF fucking shithole. Never want visit again. pay truly obscene amount money move there. Bring dead! 'ring' bring dead! 'ring' Astonishing. knew allowed bars restaurants remain open people would go them? well. Giving teachers wary would disaster. would encourage opening schools kids able get vaccinated, teachers maybe wouldn’t get sick, kids would spread one another bring home. 

They need keep schools closed vaccinate everyone, less. sucks, I’m parent, get it’s way. Maybe economy based selling shit people really need boss made children poor Asian countries great edifice building economy? Ok Bernie wouldn’t like talk like fucking shit Someone needs set website stream ICU multiple hospitals various high case count states. people get real sense like. Unfortunately, that's probably possible due HIPAA. young fairly healthy, there's little chance get anything mild symptoms. occasionally see ""young mother three dies COVID"", far between. Even then, stories leave significant medical history headline. Plot twist: they’re driving Colorado. don’t want though, please spread word awful here. make shit up, don’t even mind. constant volcanic ash clouds disgusting, lack modern infrastructure problematic, etc. Man, know you, love you. heart hurts you.

What love? Love selfless, even self-sacrificial dedication another person's well-being. means actions shaped concern people love, even give things precious what's best. driving force soldier fighting protect homeland. binds tie two people together marriage. I'm Christian, believe death Jesus cross redemption well. Things like romance, family ties, friendships, forgiveness born love.

And hate? believe hate intense dislike defined dictionary. Rather, hate true antithesis love. self-interest takes priority other's well-being, intentionally desire see someone suffer. heart turns become greatest priority. 

So say love you, heart breaks you, set apart. Yet often see striking cases, especially choose lead represent us, self-interest reigns. could approach world way, might able put aside awful fighting, put mask, live love other, might save lives neighbors.

Put mask. Stay home. I’m state that’s hard hit this. I’d take vaccine leaves Phase 3 trials, I’d prefer AstroZeneca/Oxford vaccine would least likely rushed pressure US government. Sadly lot research covid-19 going way. Everyone wants latest theory people protect bury contradictory evidence small footnote. clickbait title. see defense as, ""If god wants whomever infect, time."" stop testing stop getting COVID-19. mean pretty simple!

Thank this. words hear fairly regularly, rarely see spelled. Wane one words. news seems getting better last week.

The daily fatality rate up, daily new case numbers up.... even talking about?

I'm good news, but... huh?

The vaccine news good. That's it. eliminate wide swath possible effects implementing short term animal testing. It’s concept often referred microbiology “span speed species”. 

For instance mouse life span 2 years ideal conditions. Meaning 2 year old mouse “elderly mouse”. Now, mice humans course quite different, cellular mechanism enzyme action/protein synthesis perspective mice humans share awful lot common. 

One learn lot possible long term effects mammalian cellular systems giving young mouse something watching progression “old age” - essentially speeding span testing genetic analogues (albeit imperfect).

This animal testing mandated... except reason everyone scared willing skip agencies put place protect us considered unethical immoral rapid development (the FDA) even sanctioning such!!

We talking subverting decades medical science protocols knee jerk reaction irrational fear. life don’t see that’s “good idea.” But... apparently I’m minority one. first time since March less 10 patient ICU stockholm. (8 today) case essentially caught high school activity... football. still understand articles never report cause death. basic journalism 101. 

Underlying causes? Pnuemonia?

They continue report deaths fail actually report detail ever. That’s little dramatic. It’s aerosolized. speaking thinking wear mask second step outside.

Hate break 4 5 people mean amazing immune system.  not. median NYC income like 50k. TV really fall lineups already filmed? IIRC several shows cut episodes supposed air spring hadn’t filmed yet.  don’t think many shows ready fall, especially since networks completely pushed fall lineups mid season. could see animation “new” content get fall, unless filming resumes relatively soon.

The side TV is, ad revenues. way down, last heard, due many businesses closed restricted (and ones open lost business too). 100% true. Biden sucks. He’s less bad Trump. Vote him. won’t change anything structurally ready even worse person Trump run.

That's fact I'm reminded constantly people move visit explain we're abnormal ones they're ""average."" lockdowns. nearly tight enough.

I think fair assume g-mutation strain little dash journalistic spice get clicks. say it’s likely older people heart conditions likely develop worse heart conditions. It’s accurate say young people develop “long term debilitating” complications. isn’t. 

I know 9 people around age (19-23) it. 4 didn’t actually know it, rest said like mild cold fever, none said it’s affected much afterwards. Simple statistics would tell least *one* would experiencing debilitating side effects. Italy Spain got hit extraordinary hard start pandemic.

They're trying use respirators more, found patients lie stomachs sometimes beneficial respirator, nonetheless still good news! think part problem US lax enforcement quarantine, anything all. lot people ignoring it, like lot governments enforcing it.

For example, friend fine quarantine. Wore mask went followed everything close legally could. absolutely denying COVID masks anything. early June, restaurants started opening restrictions got bit looser. Literally day legally allowed, texted us asking wanted go get Buffalo Wild Wings... he's going eat carrying normally well within rules current restrictions day.

I'm sure there's ton people like - people spouting anti-intellectual Trump bullshit, also careless enough blindly follow whatever legally allowed. need serious enforcement strict regulations keep people line, even means alt-righters pissing pants crying freedoms. can't rely average person right thing without told to. - ""Bible Belt Conspiracy Theorists firm beliefs hoax pandemic experience tragic loss kids"" “If can’t win, change rules. can’t change rules, ignore them.” (cough!)

He assumed he's Gen X must irresponsible party animal caused parents' death. Reddit spoils faith humanity sometimes. ""consipiracy"". Tegnell outright said controlled burn towards herd immunity Sweden needed go. fits nicely reality Sweden long time far highest burden infection Europe, high degree put Sweden developed nation Europe list ""risk countries"". fits Sweden devoting overwhelming proportion testing budget towards antibody tests, PCR. fits officials *constantly* talking Sweden going better due higher rate immunity. fits saying herd immunity coming April, May, June, end summer. fits Sweden one highest death tolls per capita world. 

So actions words fit, clear what's going they're running herd immunity strategy denying polite call that. Buy plant milk, save cow forcibly impregnated over. College high school 30 years ago. 90% boring, required, standardized, sad classes taught washed professors untrained graduate students 10% vital learning experiences taught passionate teachers. like high school, make without graduating, want fruitful job fields recommended/required get degree. 100% correct, remember hearing everything ""if healthcare professional trained enough use/remove mask increase risk transmission"" ""Seasonal flu serious threat Covid 19"" despite evidence nothing saying true.

They also tried suggest washing hands enough despite mountains evidence Asia/Europe virus droplet airborne respiratory spread.

This telling everyone virus threat risk Canadians low (even Italian hospitals overwhelmed, Chinese cities ran crematoriums 24/7) 

Possibly largest source fake news misinformation virus far official government medical sources Canada. later lies government became obvious rapid 180 see outpouring wild popular conspiracies ranging crazy (5G causes covid! plan make immune system weak requiring masks!) pretty plausible though unproven (Virus gain function research strain, Chinese government deliberately allowed citizens leave knowing would infect countries level playing field.)

Its actually genius move part government try target ""conspiracies"" draws attention total incompetence outright lies early pandemic. Keep em scared devided Yeah said dangerous wearing (fallacy) people would touch faces take wrong infect needed goggles also. terrible misinformation I'm shocked worked many people. work me. I'm conservative see danger. follow guidelines, wear mask, social distance, wife kids left property months. see people Conn., NY, NJ, MASS name come small state every weekend. masks, quarantines, respect locals rural healthcare system. get it, Reddit, conservatives=bad liberals=saviors saw someone explain virus deadly fatality rate 0.6% overall. chart cited 5% 65 supposedly that's big deal them? can't see .064 death rate big deal? everyone gets that's likt 1.7 million deaths America alone. There's estimates like 40-70% Americans going get virus next year million Americans dying one single illness year totally plausible.  Yeah, there's varying degrees right left. generalizing. right wing premier excellent job far, right wing middle left wing U.S.. Well that’s part HIPAA. Sane thing work. learn someone gotten covid, who. Florida stopped testing... Mine too. lies made money. Pretty much, aggravating bees prior entering well someone woke up, walked dog, saw first thing flat tire means replacing/pumping back ( spare jack)... hits close home :( Like anti lockdown protest? Still can’t afford lol new mutation mutation discovered couple months ago seen Vietnam? stupid people everywhere Can’t scapegoat virus multi billion dollar war many people opposed government telling do.

You might many people begging government tell significant portion population listening politicians TV hosts medical advise. don’t put shoes days, would need suit? Heck times I’ve physically gone work dress code jeans polos. strain widely circulating time. one got G part switched in.  Similar situation me. People think mortality scary, really not. Mordbidity, terrifying. :/ Cases going down, deaths trail cases since usually takes weeks hospital people die. Peak deaths likely come middle August. Mate. Cut out.

I live here, Melbourne, YES we’re worried 500 person days. first wave, kind figures whole country combined throwing up. one city match worst first wave own. We’ve got problem Melbourne, put right.

Sometimes it’s America. Wane guy knew died weekend, family confirmed corona, strongly suspect was. would first person directly know died this. 

It shock, last time talked healthy good. Get rekt defined plateau. fact trending down. Deaths peak soon follow. Every major model pessimistic off. sure one would accurate. dangerous. Stop saying everything disagree dangerous. Christ know need do? Hand flame throwers shut everything people running around flamethrowers. ever someone try’s come outside said people fire flame thrower yell “back fucking house!!!”. Amazing. Every word said wrong. understanding need keep rent high keep mortgage lenders happy. value property often dependent rental price. Phase 1+2 usually involves healthy volunteers, phase 3 expands age groups, people different ailments, etc.

If suddenly turns vaccine incompatible with, say, gout, better catch vaccinated 10 people gout vaccinated 10,000. Absolutely. someone already chronic health conditions, afraid mortality. afraid morbidity.

Most people afraid mortality. sky diver / adrenaline junkie afraid die love. ""We gotta go day."" people much afraid morbidity risk calculations, people don't. Lol. man speaks facts. get local news (luckily?). I'm surprised distraction tactics though. Trying distract people save lives. beyond upsetting. That's grim. money, health. Compare timing ""dip"" White House made reports bypass CDC. according argument, herd immunity strategy real climate change real?

I really don’t follow logic.

One scientific fact guarantee accuracy completely unrelated speculative nonsense.

Summer break pre-planned, even without COVID. Many jobs also temporarily moved WFH, starting expect people back offices. There’s also expectation continuing education structured manner summer (life-learning, sure. Trigonometry history probably much.)

You’re comparing vastly different things Currently us 1100 deaths per day, shy 8k per week. slowly rising, unlikely hit 11k first week August. Second, cases peaked week ago, deaths likely peak couple weeks. Peak may reach 11k one week, we'll likely end month started 8k. Honestly, think effective early treatment likely largely get us back normal vaccine fully distributed Even make Harley Davidson branded masks Dutch friends think it’s hoax (the Bill Gates variant). Dumb asses exist everywhere... Covid Georgia insane right now, every store/restaurant near covid positive staff forcing staff work positive.

S. Korea's methods solid legal base, also firmly based Constitution Republic Korea legislated democratic protocols.

The methods pragmatic, dogmatic, purpose saving lives.

The law activated public health emergency contagion, coronavirus pandemic, zombie-virus pandemic, invasion body-snatching aliens. close friend working ASU. opening back soon. students teachers option attend classes remotely, 70% students polled plan attend person. Plus dorms going full. big school too. Something like 100k students. hope safe. certainly going learn works doesn’t next months. Unfortunately pay cost though They're using tech Ebola vaccine.

Same tech oxford aswell. Heart disease loading hospitals brim sick patients, dumbass thought fatigue bad enough, try [significant cognitive deficit](http://wherearemypillows.com/?p=1236), too. lung scarring, kidney issues, neurological disturbances, host long-term complications. pretty picture.

Stay safe, folks still drive property prices way making properties affordable normal locals. Wait till cold weather sets in. Thank sharing perspective! I’d like hear students ages feeling going back school, 

I mean ASKED STUDENTS?? 

Students, ages, feeling returning school? Feel free share voice here, like student did.

Going rough month everyone trying go back work, school, sports. chance gets better spring. 200k already happened... Haha bread maybe circus watch days cSPAN. That's whole city week drunk driver analogy also good. wear seatbelt protect catastrophic injury. drive sober protect yourself, protect around you. Wearing mask simply protecting you; protecting people around you. issue needs really driven home anti-mask crowd.   fucking making joke said choose socialism barbarism 2016. bad fucking insisted barbarism pushed HRC Donald Trump. Hurricane numbers...I'd expect backlog cases deaths added point. stonks award just...no. no. entities already created. you’re one needs provide evidence. simply stated plans already existed confirmed. Good day sir. feel like gas-lighting me.  seen anyone claiming daily deaths relative finally locked things down. around 2,600 daily worst late april 30k daily cases. 1,100-ish daily deaths 60k daily cases. Canada different us nobody visits Canada. measures Canada taken covid us hasn’t? Sadly been. view 60000 good day It’s actually 18.2%. 

There’s breakdown right numbers skewed look better. Yeah shit hard trust many are. 

We're bad way going get worst. hope wake country needs done. read article? talk data obvious spike memorial day harder see one 4th July. quotes least one hospital stated saw surge hospitalization following 4th July. primary explanation paper lot spread coming family gatherings based see peaks contract tracing, meaning family gatherings around 4th July would caused additional transmission. headline oversimplifies entire article about, article interesting. They'll call stream fake. mean there's people think earth flat even streams flat. Health-illiterate much different insurance-illiterate. Maybe teach health insurance class grade school Americans exist adults pay-to-live culture. Tragic totally predictable. thing try educate nature thing. Divide 12. number based annual rate. I'd argue that, least therapeutic side, legal (but probably decriminalized - illegal sell, have). There's lot evidence hallucinogenics potential treating mental illness used clinical setting, trained mental health expert's oversight. need research safely, definitely worth looking into, especially rates depression seem rising.

A little different form marijuana's potential painkiller, anti-emetic, appetite stimulant properties (plus number ""off label"" uses). mostly agree harmful alcohol, like keep arguments medical recreational separate. I’m curious know read statistic. discover vaccine, run proper trials, submit vaccine FDA approval usually takes 10 years more. US even make dishsoap anymore, said anything retail clothes? Disease run rampant cruise ships is. Bunch idiots thinking it’s ok run cruises pandemic idiots think need follow laws DHMs, shocked pickachu face get shutdown ticketed.

Where live, public mask mandate. local bar owner running pool tournament (so important right now) refused enforce mask use. health department gave chance comply face shutdown. know, got shutdown complaining it.

Like dude, caused following simple rule. still need grade limit much one grade. say, ""very little chance"" means nothing. friends family want one becomes seriously ill dies? dumb take I've seen occasionally crisis. economy shambles compared was. strong social safety net work without strong economy. 

Also, without stimulus bills, composition deserves scrutinized, society would collapse. 

Basically post long assertion without evidence. know, never really thought way move next headline gets attention.

""What wacky thing president say certain brand chunky peanut butter? offended? BREAKING 6pm"" people get Covid19 never even know it. unfortunately means no, morons make through. reminds traffic accident comics person causes accident safely makes out. Looking rear view mirror ""what terrible drivers!"" Get house unless want dunked boiling acid hour. outsiders sterilized least America didnt spray beaches bleach, wait herd immunity, weld citizens homes hurricane testing numbers yet. coming soon. testing numbers going testing shortage happening right someone posted last month. 

 Medical Laboratory Scientist major hospital Florida. currently run covid virus PCR tests (not antibody test). wanted put last week number test performing dropped dramatically, good way.  run cobas 6800 machines ordered roche (the manufacturer) currently slowed supply test kits. Previously running 1700 tests daily limited 940 daily due supply limits. resulted backlog specimens (which another matter entirely).  told nationwide shortage limiting everyone using platform (cobas) make will. want people know working hard get tests out. also want note started seeing 2-4 positives 94 patient run seeing 8-16. (Not official number observed) Stay safe masks please! They’re reporting almost 1000 per day. goes up, likely rate transmission increase. 350k probably fair prediction half million wouldn’t outlandish. Even kept 250k seem okay?! That's whole city three months... saying months. completely necessary understandable privacy laws, could way footage really like Covid wards. 

Some people need visual, visceral experience it'll really absorb. 

With 9/11 looping footage MONTHS planes hitting, buildings falling, people running debris clouds choking, people falling/jumping towers, etc. made massive impact.

With get exhausted doctors bruised faces, that's enough. people need shocked caring. answer federal government steal tax dollars create larger federal entities add layers bureaucracy. don’t know would make difference pandemic happened Obama admin. That’s poor straw man position took. Also, name single country handled better? right now, spikes happening France, Spain, Japan, etc. find country size dense states like CA show better? case don’t know you’re talking about, maybe you’re racist parts Asia Africa think it’s fault. think people haven’t realized real terrible Covid is, won’t realize way either. said, need pull head asshole. used eating shit can't tell difference reality large intestines anymore.

But seriously, grow fucking spine, simpering coward. thought problems sub always full panicky nonsense, it’s complete trash now. Mods leave misinformation like fucking day. two reasons wear mask year. Covid bushfire smoke. Wrong. Even Trump everything could, Trump haters would side refusing wear masks calling virus fake. True story. People dumb. simple. People influenced political party. serious threat does? played lot DD.
Nice see someone use connotation denotation. maybe people finally able see breath winter cold recognize far really carries someone else’s face. Yes are, you’ll stone dead moment... wouldn’t say doomed - like really really fucked, especially economically, good decade. Im trying point common. That's good thing. nice rational view leads optimistic outcome even overall everything shit unfortunately help single parent households obviously sad. shit black people* 

if protesting something related whites people would it. Keep mind one claiming vitamins prevent infection. speculating make likely survive. logic caught Covid-19 would dead anyway leave stats. already going die day yes single factor. Maybe prone heart attack, number health issues could ultimately lead death, without Covid equation underlying conditions may killed years. *gasp* damn..got almost 300k go fund me...  crazy... wonder much white guy would get samething happen.  OK cool hopefully mass produced. not, things take forever get back normal. Maybe ‘bad’ person, one speaks language hateful ignorance. 
Better silent thought fool... knows term gaining popularity guess due bold faced unashamed lying current administration. particular bit lying NCAA etc. happens fall line gaslighting admin done pandemic writ large. I'm NYC. want 'affordable' enjoy 3 hour one way commute.  overweight parents? smoke? drink? exercise? Im willing bet answer questions follows pattern people dying covid. Still tragedy? Absolutely I've listening Week Virology (high quality, real science, long covid) they've saying paradigm change episode 640 - rapid tests 'inaccurate' less 'sensitive', means higher threshold detect accurate tests, give false negatives people lower levels virus.

BUT people infectious lower thresholds, higher levels completely accurate. rapidly test people repeatedly, catch people infectious, care really low levels sensitive tests catch.

Much better rapid testing infectious levels super slow testing level. RN here.

We best. patients, colleagues, ourselves.

There come time forced choose families professions.

God help us fall. It’s coming. Reddit introduce gif responses words dozen gif responses come mind. Florida still reporting obfuscating nonsense alternative metrics. ""New individuals positive rate"" metric states bother with. Isn’t like 1/3 US population overweight? would terrified child living parents overweight/obese since big chance accidentally killing (and won’t fault). Masks don’t protect protect others, takes one idiot wear mask around carrier taking home vulnerable parents. Seriously this, live relatively expensive/higher-tax suburb, sure could save money moving conservative suburb, can't put price piece mind able go store seeing everyone wear mask, general local governments take pandemic seriously. amount tax savings Lower Cost Living would worth live state state government take seriously (FL, TX, AZ, etc.) esp face federal inaction. house second round relief passed 11 weeks now.

Yeah, NBA community work one city, yeah!!!!!!!!! OMG, good. 

I'm going enjoy seeing start realize money dried up. like you, others. 6 months woke help-me-big-government. Well, ignoring facts.


We've entered new period called ""un- enlightenment"" guess. pretty vindicating proof beyond doubt every US soldier past 20 years bloodthirsty racists never cared America American lives.

This part that's getting downvotes. bullshit statement that's probably indicative actually knowing anybody military. one thing say military done anything useful last 20 years (I know people military would agree that), another thing altogether say soldiers bloodthirsty racists.

A lot people military really believe need defend country, provides career opportunity. lot signed clueless young adults recruited high school.

Great part experts many choose from. ones exactly?

The ones said, wear mask help. ""COVID airborne"" (I many comments deleted suggested such). can't wear properly anyways? healthcare workers need instead? maybe should? need googles?

What's next, UV buttplugs? guess Agent Orange right along. Maybe Fauci recommend inject bleach soon. may go prison didn’t want wear mask. really worth it? Probably far better chance getting virus prison outside enjoying freedumbs Everyone. In. New. York. City. Got. immunity kicked black brown communities going protests, affluent white contact tracers specifically asked question whether individual went protest not. Get nonsense. 

Fauci said avoid crowds. mind think protests crowds. I’ve said thousand times last 4 months!!! friends irl! started 2018, I'm sure covid nail coffin many, thousands retailers shut covid buddy mine got car broken Home Depot West Loop. Somebody filmed phone got license number. access look up, went address car there.

He called cops video, address everything. officer told nothing could - everyone patrol basically writing tickets higher priority. 8% population understood it. appreciate someone’s guess  Thank sharing! That's world think we're splitting hairs.

Right. Nothing worry here. He's fine it. Keep mind, father tickets since 197-something, died, husband got them, husband already son gets them, like tickets going anywhere. ones went to, everyone wearing masks except people stage.

I'll admit consider fact NY actually shut properly unlike us Los Angeles. 

It's sad felt like really right track. held like 4-6 weeks, definitely now. 

Enjoy now! I'm truly terrified what's going come 2 months tbh.  barely getting enough people enlist now. Trump pick Fauci though

He picked participate press briefings, that’s reason anyone talks him. couple dozen people task force four anyone ever talks given role spokespersons. work contributed humanity's greater understandings HIV/AIDs

Perhaps researcher. director NIAID accused carrying water Reagan administration ignored AIDS. Specifically Fauci accused acting urgency generally held part White House’s failure care. Given benefit hindsight think it’s fair say administration response, part of, avoidable failure. 

Fauci bureaucrat, statements often align administrations he’s serving better worse. It’s personality contrasts Trumps anyone really praising him. It’s cult personality side Trump. Neither done anything specifically, I’m aware of, crisis deserves much praise. Saving face politically big part it, also suspect countries don’t want enemies know vulnerable right disease’s impact military, supply chains, etc. wouldnt assume unintelligent, lack good education, mental health problems- whole spectrum. 
I mean whole spectrum asshole actually mental health problem.

We've already seen quite I'm sure come. :( They're IQ, though, constructed way. believe want essentially. also say death numbers inflated anyone dies labeled COVID-19. Why? never explain part. Apparently there's big shadowy conspiracy everywhere. sure. idea hospitals area even like, giving anecdotal story. We're medium sized hospital definitely areas premier trauma center, giving corroborating perspective article every fucking Monday weekend dip. I'd agree teacher/student relationship could involve gas-lighting, depending relationship.

An organization trying downplay COVID risk organization unethically concerned bottom line safety.  using relationship dynamics emotionally manipulate someone. company covers safety issues products ""gaslighting""  company fudges numbers influence stock price ""gaslighting"".  political party group runs ads intending inflame people ""gaslighting"".

Don't find evidence overuse all, word existed, used types contexts 2-3 years ago, suddenly, used almost generic insult anything? like 5-year old learns new word uses constantly months, even really fit. shut testing? mystery pneumonia instead covid like Texas   Yeah matter time long stick it.

Yes, matter fact, want hear opinion father's toxic politics foolish self-endangering behavior. want hear kid politician thinks parent's politics whack. Sadly, deaths significantly higher April. higher, well way catching up, given deaths lag cases continued increase, think we’re track surpass April’s death numbers next month two. Here’s Worldometer’s graph US daily deaths:  Hey now, surely successful businessmen need collect TV paycheck playing businessman reality TV show. /s

People like Bill Gates Warren Buffet criticize Trump, successful businessmen history, oh would know. sucks sorry man hope get new job. I’m enemy ;) moved here.

It's literally old Washington meme video. ""He'll save children, British children"" shown over.

You've cited one riot - large damaging one that. no, source agree you. 

How long take Charlottesville recover Unite Right rally? ""Nationwide, 190,600 people died usual March 15 July 18, according C.D.C. estimates, adjust current death records account typical reporting lags. number 50,000 higher official count coronavirus deaths period. Higher-than-normal death rates widespread across country; Alaska, Hawaii Maine show numbers look similar recent Maybe think big deal before. hope did. ultimately matter, though; still terrible loss anyone, let alone young man might still need parental guidance. Hotel, food? Sure there's free shuttle humans need sleep eat... Yes! made lot assumptions post. assume person teaching happen years. still purely speculative part. 

Furthermore flu vaccine helps us SIGNIFICANTLY.  isnt 100% prevents many deaths allows us continue function ways probably able without it. One trial Coronavirus vaccine showed 90% people took able immune response (if recall correctly). even 50% population took vaccine huge chunk people would stop spread reduce dramatically could contain better appear. Yes concede point guarantee get vaccine also plausible possibility within next year. 

 hustle get applaud you. Seriously! Good you!!!.

As hustle, itwas struggle taught good lessons perseverance put health 1st that's necessary. flew another country volunteer contracted tuberculosis 2008. right pretty career ending back injury. lost job insurance right got tuberculosis. Awkward timing. diagnosis insurance tuberculosis surfaced weird ways. took years nurse back health. worked part time untill felt healthy enough more. I'm glad work full time may increased chance TB became activated contagious. Finally body got better learned strategies overcome another physical disability able go back school get degree working multiple part time jobs. need pat back somebody online know personally I'm really proud done get here. also know trust instincts importance health. 

I also know quit job protect health do. continually weigh cost benefit ratio specifics life. 

Again.... really stresses profession teaching disappear due response virus, would go ahead get online start studying new profession. life hands lemons, make lemonade always say. 

 already started consider would reason resign. sister even thought helping connect husband's employer. know would survive even crisis. already lived one pandemic (TB) know **** hits fan bounce back long I'm smart. dad works nursing home. wasn’t working yesterday found COVID case facilities. dad working today area case. I’m worried might catch something. also worry even place cares health residents get COVID, schools. 2 brothers, one goes daycare one goes high school. feel like journalists note this, post articles like general. Texas adds numbers yesterday, numbers probably going heavily increase, doubt they’ll update news say “lol nvm” know spoke diagnosed? seems like another assumption part.

A “public figure”? She’s recording artist, politician. seems like stretch well. lack social media posts topic mean covid denier anything. Again, think you’re assuming much.

This pointless conversation. You’re looking someone hate you’ve chosen random seemingly innocent person. really don’t like people judge others baseless assumptions. Bye. He's also leading worsening them. stop 200K either.

ETA: HCWs saying practice active euthanasia happen facilities way, shape form disproves happened some. love new data suppression conspiracy narrative. Hospital info moved HHS, arguments there. I’m sure WH/HHS departments botched reporting info well. specific subset information regarding ICU capacity, ventilator use, etc...

How suddenly drastically get notion entire healthcare industry states actively lying case numbers? guess it’s totally possible increased mask mandates (by local officials private companies) opening phase rollbacks nothing it. 

People want reason angry. SF, rent drop spotty. mostly places live close work downtown lot nightlife (SOMA example), greatest place live otherwise. Cheaper, neighborhoods actually gone price (ie Inner Richmond). want learn like crash one too? not, don’t ride one. really weird depressing see seedy underbelly medicine. 😂 used go ride bike weekends sunset

How girlfriend losing apartment? amusing enough you? 20 million might evicted, fucking hilarious Ugh, autocorrect worst another language. Sometimes makes feel like I'm going crazy-- really mean word trying type, mean got autocorrected to? sure remember definitions correctly? misspell first place?

Health insurance awful. top expensive, nightmare paperwork organization. keep spreadsheet check insurance cheaper overall year. buy employer marketplace, expensive general since one subsidizing it, variety. insurance employer offers crap, since chronic illness would end costing even buying unsubsidized plan. go figure Insurance covers 20% physical therapy, B covers $20 copay costs month, C covers 50% expensive medications, would pay doctor rely on, etc.

It sucks especially sick, can't concentrate getting better, need spend good portion energy handling bills insurance. feeling worst, need call insurance company ask they're covering X, call doctor ask ask insurance cover X, repeat several times either insurance caves suck pay bill full. Need see new doctor? call first check covered, full, support staff covered, covered location see at, purpose need (because, example, Dr. Medicine might covered Boston office, Lexington office, might covered neuroopthamology (brain-eye) plain old ophthalmology (eye) visit). penalty checking things easily thousands dollars.

If wondering ""how people afford it?"", many don't. federal minimum wage salary $15k/yr. Even earn double that, that's $30k/yr-- hardly enough afford $10k deductible. ton preventable deaths people can't afford see doctor, even insurance. Even good job, deductibles surprise bills covered all, could easily wipe savings one health crisis.  annoying bit lot talking points factual, confused contradictory messaging early allows sow doubt. unlike this; http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations Stop trying make in-person school happen. It’s going happen.

It happen long enough get hundreds thousands people around country sick... schools closed end September, like beginning.

This absolute madness. get people rely young kids school go work, really feel them. solution, though, send kids teachers school employees harms way; *the solution government step look health, safety, welfare citizens.*

Isn't justification huge Department Defense budget US, spending ensure health, safety, welfare US citizenry? Well little 100 nanometer virus exposed much certain factions US government *actually* care safety country's citizens.

Louie Gormless, dumbest man Congress Excess deaths also much lower reported COVID deaths. moderate, maybe right leaning here.

Western countries get vaccine, fast. 

They'll vaccinate they'll run economy like always population.


Things going soooo rough third world countries though. like past epidemics. 

China india already make 3 billion people 7 billion people earth. vaccines secured. 

The USA europe make 1 billion. also vaccines secured. 28 patients (14 men 14 women; age range, 21–92 years) positive findings lung US chest CT. US, B-lines present 100% patients, 19 (67.9%) patients pulmonary consolidation. Thickened pleural lines observed 17 patients (60.7%), one patient (3.6%) showed small amount pleural effusion.

B lines really interstitial boundary. sort sack lungs reside in. really permeable barrier.

With COVID often see inflammation set making difficult people breathe.

Inflammation reversed subside eventually may leave lingering disease pockets dead lung. 

Pulmonary consolidation refers much lung currently functional. People consolidation use less lungs fluid build up. also reversed although may leave lingering damage.

Thickened pleural lines pretty scary. basically scar tissue harder reverse. enough scaring, folks become eligible oxygen therapy, lung transplant, etc.

Pleural effusion really prone secondary infections. fluid fills space outside lungs making difficult breathe. require draining fluid. sad un-necessary.

Yes, pain associated shutdown economy huge. false dichotomy.

It's clear point universal, ubiquitous mask use makes fairly safe economy *mostly* functional. doesn’t answer question. Even that, release people pre-trial? Jesus. WTF people?

And many parents' ego can't handle it. Drain swamp! yup, white lab coat ones front supreme court.

anyone says confusing paying attention opinion, ha. 

Frankly think super complicated point many ""sides"" oversimplifying situation fit narrative policy behavior wants. There's much know, many serious consequences every policy, many conflicting agendas needs forget Nov 2019-Feb 2020. outdoors typically large openings outdoors giving lots air changes per hour compared normal indoor spaces. probably tested hospital... turnarounds results medical institutions next day, he'd know immediately infected. Also probably tested weekly basis he's frontline care. must torpedos hand /s I’m saying crowds people don’t spread virus. Fauci testified, certainly potential cause outbreak. However, trip Disney World exponentially dangerous crowds, you’d stopping gas stations, eating restaurants, staying hotels several days time. one 100% secure precautions, evidenced medical staff becoming infected, expose many ways trip dangerous, mention fact could spread virus along entire route infect numerous communities. get crazy rents charge crazy prices. [$18 yogurt, $23 $6 want add toast. plus tax tip. [Not really, according talking anti-mask protests

Those ones definitely account whole mask thing. 40% SARS survivors diagnosed psychiatric disorders ~3.5 years fact. No, don’t want give companies anything. Defund schools give parents money choose form education want kids. use money enroll online learning program (there dozens around 20+ years I’m sure soon popping up) otherwise personal tutoring always available maybe won’t something looked wealthy.

I think future “system” actually provides resources students learn lot like khanacadamy. Grading, monitoring tests taking, curriculum provided students, grading everything else done automatically. 

There many resources right student needs extra help extra examples/practice tests online subject school. Hoosier hell ...that $365 year testing absolutely nothing towards reason behind $1200. 

Jobs going magically return. Millions still unemployed. Bills still go unpaid people living streets much sooner, tested not. Sweden plan, includes high compliance wearing masks, hand washing, social distancing without lock down. Even that, still debate whether approach better/worse full shut down.

To suggest similarity Sweden plan clusterfuck non-plan US is, best, disingenuous. CDC statistic called ""Percent Expected Deaths."" compares number deaths given week year average number deaths previous five years. PED number 100, number people died week died week previous years.

You see here. Keep mind reporting delayed recent weeks complete yet. early June, PED 110. words, since early June, Coronavirus causing less 10 percent deaths would expected. statistic paints far less alarming picture pandemic major media outlets portray. Thoughts? hike google earth... Look swine flu vaccine 1976...... Rushed vaccines bad news Lost parents 23, fucking sucked. Remind 72 hours. Yes, really. Lol fuck cant quit jobs good conscience, tens thousands us riding home done that. never signed sacrificed reason. Honestly, I'm yet convinced yet. still significant amount population like Trump also like masks vote. Considering entire US falling apart seams, pretty ridiculous think ""***People much choice. Money usually deciding factor they're going do***"" regarding health safety something extremely American, know tell you.

I think environment shapes behaviour. Merry Christmas. brother believes 

He’s trump follower thinks Fauci, used like, suspect.

There's lot questionable here. Well, mean comparing uk Spain. European countries. Obviously death infection bad outcome. residents

Unless we're quarantining people go like New Zealand we'll still fucked trust analysis public health officials wrong again. set reminder come back end week. we're 11k deaths, I'll gladly admit CDC better me.  California mask mandate (since middle June) bars gyms closed here. outdoor seating restaurant. OFFS. You’re weeds this. Like you’ve become obsessed strawmen scenarios keep concocting. 

I’m sure ways create policies could mitigate things little imagination. Rules percentage shares would go X number employees worked X amount time. Like companies fucking NOW. 

Every labor income policy since 40 hour work week END BUSINESS KNOW market fetishists.

I think that's newsworthy part ""This year, female unemployment reached double digits first time since 1948, Bureau Labor Statistics started tracking women’s joblessness.

It would *very* effective (my comment) would need full face protection (think pressurized hazmat suit like see movies) keep eyes

Likewise, virus stable enough truly airbone, much thorough sanitizing would need done post exposure.

So, said, n95 would effective. unless prison system gets radical change soon

I already said that. 


Edit: case know, understand would rather prison current system, Prisons right for-profit companies, need inmates stay open business, I'm glad idiots getting prison would fewer raids poor communities get inmates. endless debate validity IQ studies, interesting note men women average IQ, much variance males. geniuses idiots.

Laughs teacher. They're also setting on-campus testing surveillance, try catch cases turn widespread outbreaks.

Can't test everyone every day, test handful students, staff, faculty variety different departments, handle what's happening. brother worked Costco told people returned half eaten roast chicken, half tray fruits vege many times. manager approved returns. well may accurate time vaccine comes fall/winter.

Assuming 1k deaths per day stays (which actually less average), puts us 90 days lines timing 240k. Seems like tail end estimate looking accurate made early.

And know small potatoes considering much risk schools open up. know people die get sick virus spread. know going back person classes putting thousands people risk death sickness. know teachers amazing people deserve live full lives deserve afraid go school afraid dying.

I also know know much longer live like this. mean feel guilty much want things normal. mean, feels really selfish me, people working getting paid shit, people homeless, people dying I'm wondering last year high school gonna go. want go back march freaking taking SAT biggest problem. 

I hope schools reopen. hope much schools reopen go school bring home COVID infects family. dad already high risk pre-existing conditions dies INSISTED mom register person school becomes option. teacher dies? There's way know me. mean... matter happens next months I'd feel guilty possibility (and HIGH likelihood) bad outcomes.

I know. There's also everything going America. feel freaking angry time anti-maskers COVID deniers think right idiot put people risk. completely agreed points; upvote/downvote ratio two comments however makes wonder many people read past first sentence lol. Well said - agree 100%.  Daycares - formal home based - definitely open year. YMCA open schools closed there. 40k kids nationwide. city NY operated daycare 10k kids March/April. 0 cases spread within daycares. 

Closing schools, least things open meaning people work (you don’t qualify UI refuse work) loony. kids mostly interacting kids daycare workers aunties anyway. doesn’t reduce spread, switches could happen less formal controlled environments, really harms younger kids special needs/ESL/low income kids. Where’d get “many” “debilitating” from? Going bar party = 1 event hours. saying covid can't spread there, surely would, look school bunch people 8 hours day 5 days week inside small room hardly ventilation we're looking far rapid spread *A woman holds dog wearing protective mask well ...* *(Getty/Kyodo)*   That's fine clean hands properly. don’t think improvement people Arizona realizing virus real something take serious? well protests crowds IMO see way see crowd reaction public health crisis move goal lines time. feel like everyone forgets “Sars killed librul Osama” “the flu kills 70k year, nbd” “the numbers fake despite year year growth overall” Except son Barron distance learning, course. Wonder people always said every countries numbers fake purposely lying numbers 

Their voice loud US rather obviously it... football parents. Parents going stores mask gloves, ok kid going training without protection? Ah, cooking half-assed plans throw two days, ensuring normalcy: Economy ^^tm SARS-COV-2 particular.

Before became ill healthy active 20 something. intelligence analyst military. Now? full-time work 2 years; part time work 1. use travel, socialize, look forward things etc. hardest thing I've ever dealt life......by far.

I say scare anybody else. understanding long term illness COVID looks like well understood. Maybe rare worth worrying about. say healthy last thing worried long term illness. active healthy. think something like could happen me. Boy wrong. That’s actually ridiculously small number actually. chances young healthy person dying incredibly small. Average age 54 last year. Thanks trumplers right country worse affected world misinformation say climate change human caused despite denials world leaders. ample evidence claim, provided spades. Therefore legitimate claim. D3, Zinc Picolate, Melatonin, Curcumin (although think last one probably over-hyped wouldn’t buy again). . Cases peaked Florida 2.5 weeks ago 20% peak. Deaths likely peak soon. Here's want open up. revenues budgets getting wrecked. two states increased revenue versus time last year, North Dakota Nevada.  put disclaimer, I'm denying people dieing this, search treatment/cure come ridiculous levels that's comment meaning plus Simpson reference People taking masks on, washing hands... virus passed around via touch mainly. Virus hands, transfers mask face removal application day. Also contaminates surface put mask contact with. Virus lives various durations depending surface type.

There reason first thing entire planet clean things test life span virus surfaces.

As say, masks fine, it’s solution problem. Wearing mask going cast magic spell put life back normal, like many people acting right now.

Wear mask, keep distance, wash hands surfaces regularly. them. LOT states didn’t report. watch numbers religiously NEVER seen happen. 

Not mention Texas’s fiasco. understand every news broadcast open close number dead, U. S. global. want broadcast instead channel identifier every damn channel. want cars loudspeakers blaring streets 9 9 PM.

I never ever able comprehend many fellow Americans simply care pandemic. weep daily. Netflix 80"" 4k TV. SF particularly tough literally nowhere expand. peninsula land connection south right entire Bay Area cities. simple supply demand: way add supply demand keeps going up, turn prices go up. Exactly. large number NASCAR crowd (and even larger number going this) types ranting Facebook they're going cooperate contact tracers love freedom.

Maybe cluster event, maybe isn't. We'll probably never know. people went probably going plenty places without masks spending time around lots people...probably also wearing masks.

Contact tracing much US point waste time. spread much many people refuse help. expected wealthy techies move modesto LOL. mAH FReEdUmB!!! make far many assumptions doling level judgment. chances young person dying Sars-Cov2 incredibly small. one saying can’t. don’t know you’re arguing made narrative. Maybe small handful people legitimately think this. I’m sorry, overwhelming amount evidence young people low risk dying. literally made distinction two. essential worker, feel sense despair misfortune? 

As many feel, feel completely swept rug, make barely anything week. ever happened pandemic pay? job seasonal lose next month, left made less unemployment. 

What do? becoming depressed jaded Pretty sure people idiots begin with, viruses static objects. survived summer. survive this.

If can’t, it’s tome learn online skill work home

Like, people going really really bad disaster happens like meteor Yellowstone? Keep sending kids school despite fires chaos burning around world? They’re gonna figure way work around said disaster. It’s going far ideal that’s disaster is.

School isn’t option. They’re gonna shut second one sick person walks inside you’re STILL gonna deal able send kids school. It’d better prepare inevitable start studying coding something mean...yeah. known? Oh Donald said would gone summer, possible he’s misinforming public literally attempting downplay occasionally outright ignore international pandemic political gain? Hmmm. example saying dangerous? perhaps source even? florida closed centers lol live 30 min San Fran hundreds times. Never seen human feces, I'm sure always regurgitated reddit. parts city, understand. way hell would move reasons.

It's bizarre things reddit clings ridiculous wrong... Hotel? Tent backyard? RV? Anything better trying keep distance 1500 square foot house Dude can't imagine small business owner.. investments stuff like theaters venues. What's happening awful..

But still change fact world changes people need change it.

If indoor theaters work, adapt. Make drive theaters..

There's things do.. sitting around complaining things might never go back were.. actually solve anything. somehow fault lower house Democrat-controlled.

At point seems like way hyperpartisanship change names political parties. Democrat Republican Progressives Republican Democratic Conservatives. we'll see stupid-vote ends voting. ""Its going away like said. Tremendous!"" Bootstraps hundreds thousands dollars US lot harder find economy nose diving... public health crisis way effectively fight compensate people can't work due COVID related causes. 

It's ridiculously expensive keep trying make pre-COIVD lifestyle reappear, keep spreading virus, keeping prolonging this, take care thousands upon thousands die seriously hospitalized. *“The advice medical experts shouldn’t politicized,” wrote. “My father ignored medical expertise COVID.”* 

Translation, ""I told so!"" That's almost 40% drop cases Monday last week 30% drop since yesterday....data seems off.  Also 50% drop positive case rate last Monday according report. I'm guessing they're missing huge amount tests. 3/4 mortgage towns... Democrats sure go great lengths hoaxes! According cdc, it’s 6 feet indoors 15 minutes constitutes “close contact”. 

I shocked read myself. got called Democrat commented post party somebody said best time party. white house cut CDC numbers fake anyway. kickstarter something kid? Fuck rona

Edit: Found article nvm knows happening training.  worth following president remorse leading followers early grave,”

good speaking up. Perhaps people listen even father drenched Trump BS. evidence? too. It’s 8 days since finished traveling Feel great. lock gates everyone in. Single mama here. two school aged kids virtual come September thank God. district work still deciding whether go work. youngest severe asthma want send daycare. I'm limbo land trying figure going need nanny. hell going pay teachers salary? Yes, want protect employers liability. Including knowingly exposing virus. went strict lockdown spring managed contain spread while, sustained. “Fake news, lol. Sheeple” think spa ones may go 1.2 atm pressure studies use 1 5-2 atm. positive though. understanding lying. lying yes also making person feel bad questioning you. feel example would help:

Why conflating them? sad, really feel her. Losing parents!

These tragedies getting attention deserve. virus widespread testing contact tracing feasible. 2.3 million **known** active cases US. true number multiple times that. Let’s say 5 million argument’s sake. 

First, testing already can’t keep up. hotspots people waiting weeks results. takes long testing useless one asymptomatic going isolate reason. jobs aren’t going give people time work without positive test, infected people waiting results world spreading virus. 

Second, think contact tracing 5 million people going work? don’t manpower that. even did, many people would exposed? Let’s say 10 per person average. That’s another 50 million people. going ask 50 million people self isolate? That’s 1/6 entire population! think jobs going give time work? better Stay Home order?

A shut way mess. Shut give symptomatic asymptomatic infected people time get illness. virus still spreading little bit can’t halt human activity, we’re side shutdown **that when** testing contact tracing become viable method control spread. OMG, idea sub existed! Thanks. feel another rabbit hole future. Six strains coronavirus? SARS-COV-2 particular? Anyone feel like year long decade? used HCQ, Zinc, AZ Officially, recommended recommended against. idea hospital staff event super surprised this. think research backing view. fact, asymptomatic carriers reason mask wearing important. look entire country, went 2200 deaths day 500, I'd say current trend counts 2nd wave. look individual states, either lot death early (the NE) lot better, lot cases/deaths (the South mostly) really waves yet (mostly low population states). year supermajority, mostly spent cleaning financial crisis Clinton Bush left behind. We've many pandemics centuries people always came back theaters. zero reason think would different. government want kids go back school! difference countries far better situations handle US. virus even peaked yet US, yet they're pretending done already someone lives county across him, county one counties area going back person school. Going back 13th. God knows what's going happen. Remember like 2,000 ish people died single day, everyone mourned put flags, put specials TV, felt fuzzy went war like 2 decades? fuck happened? Yeah must elaborate this. four countries mentioned cut UK, Spain Italy. hit really bad virus got control federal containment measures effect. Italy fuckup hospital example. also football matches still going Spain, Italy UK. One could say governments know better least need now. 

Sweden kept deliberately open whole time. every death could've possibly preventable individual level. can't simply know person A's favourite grandmother would've gotten virus died proper measures taken. Sure, would've died like countries, preventable deaths that's sure. 

I always thought Sweden wise country even bitched neighbouring countries allowing travel. one terrible thing impose questionable strategy populace (that alone bad). express desire join tourism without similar strategy bold.

I would've expected economical contraction much smaller. difference 1-2% compared countries easily leveled make much difference world currently crisis mode. Eh, know fair number well-off people like mega millions well-off, sort people would go shopping Fifth.

They're still motivated things like getting good deal room Four Seasons. Swedish triaged people got hospital. 

Basically told people stay home absolute last minute thinking reading another comment wanted see there’s way minimize chances infection. Here’s stuff thought of. 

1) Isolation. Keep sick bedroom bathroom rooms go to. Food delivered rooms. It’ll extremely difficult boredom may set fast though. 

2) Ventilation possible. need get airflow room opening window that’s option. way viral particles don’t circulate bedroom long? fan next window well blows air out. Almost like creating negative pressure bedroom. 

3) Mask wearing. I’d recommend high quality filtering masks. Maybe N95 whenever enter room sick. also possible sick wear cloth/ surgical mask whenever contact them? 
Slow shallow breaths help too. 

4) Sanitation. figure you’ll need cautious one. wear gloves, go sick’s room phone anything plan take room. wear gloves make door knob sick’s room first last item contact room. closing door room, take gloves wash hands. remove something room, (eating utensils etc) I’d personally carry straight sink wash them. 

5) Cross contamination. ties point 4 guess. think difficult part. mess every single day. recommendation would gloves masks. order important though. Put N95 anything else. lessen chance touching face airways it’s on. put fresh gloves on. Enter room keep hands away face person. Upon exiting room, gloves got go first. touching things inside rest house. they’re contaminated. Resist urge use phones anything gloves on. Leave non-contaminated items outside sick rooms never touch gloves on. Essentially, door knob exit sick room last thing touch gloves still on. remove mask gloves off. Wash hands maybe take shower leaving room. think fomite transition may important route spread virus never safe. 

Put reminder doors saying touch face body cross contaminate that’s first thing mind enter room. 

Anyway mayne, I’m trying see safe way. I’m sorry living situation necessitates first place understand. know you’d something completely different perfect world life less perfect right now. Ok wishing family best luck. I’m wishing find positivity mental well-being. family, keep pushing. 

Sorry typos I’m phone Yessss takeout drinks stick around logarithmic plots. Day day cases fluctuate, see exponential growth best 'total cases' graph, albeit different form. Check top post Friday Saturday think. There’s huge Totally Conspiracy Theory TM Feds somehow fudging case numbers (even though appropriated hospitalization data CDC) case numbers happened start trending around time feds took data away CDC (again, hospital data; case data still published states themselves)

Edit: lol actually went link post removed editing Relax, since even Russia mass availability expected next year, unlikely offered :-) Well keep masks on. bet people wearing masks. Oh Wal Mart can't catch virus. DC listed one ""lead[ing] [the] collapse"" chart shows DC 1BRs 2.7% 2BRs 4% last year.... get that, NYC 5k month get space 1k month gets Midwest. That's already $48k year eaten housing. pay double food NYC. gallon milk costs $1.50 dozen eggs 60 cents here, still live city million people.  I'll bet even worse 2x eat out. 

And New York State God awful income taxes. mean, bet lose 10k plus state. places would 1/10th that. Seems like pretty easy hit 70k me, despite many fixed costs. No, isn’t absurd much data proving protests insignificant spread. 🤦‍♀️

Not gatherings spread equally. Outdoor masks spreads magnitudes less bars family gatherings indoors, isn’t rocket science. Tons evidence exists protests insignificant spread areas protests spike north east example. 🖖😷 said sun trying kill us Florida JOKING! Almost one area social distancing. masks people walking around town couple weeks ago, still 10-15% people. People pass sidewalk shoulder shoulder room move aside without standing traffic. 

Inside stores people crowd get want shelf without waiting keep distance standing check line spacing stickers floor store employee pointing asking people back up. stores tresspassing customers without masks like supposed want lose sales, employees offer disposable mask people without one enforce use.

Our state local governments poor job early educating masks social distancing set, either/or, early really changed. confused replying wrong person? worlds biggest little dick gathering Well, neither certainly know, it’s inappropriate say either way.

This great reason contact tracing important. also area government largely failed us. Yah, sign public school relinquishing control kid school hours. said parent I'd trying send kid somewhere safer country FWIW county closed shelter today one person actually went there. ""We nothing things got worse!""

Anyone brain saw coming.. opened country solution problem.. problem grew. desperately want something work, want feel something make whole thing stop (but somehow masks much ask). Sad businesses fall probably richest buy spots things settle down. even more. Stop trying make in-person school happen. It’s going happen.  We're talking underlying health issues relate covid Numbers hard. whole point cost production lower. Salaries lower many reasons nothing ""abuse."" Maybe ask people communities whether want woke /u/ninjajoshy remove factories exploitative. sure provide families countries. way outdoor dining usual.

I find reddit shows age discussing sort financial/economic issues. I’m native Texan. Compared Colorado, California, Washington Alaska, Texas pretty. broad majority flat uninteresting. Don’t get started comparing places like Switzerland Italy Lucky! live apartment hotels near us open ""business travel only"" lol. 

No seriously great plan ahead. really need start thinking wife gets sick... tone deaf comment make.  kid’s school remote only, except case kids nowhere go, ones allowed campus. private learning pods set seen teacher assistant join remote learning class via school computer. It’s perfect, it’s better nothing, provides option parents, exposes people possible. That's sad. awfully hard thing go kid. Easy. virus wait idiot, careless, populist dumb ass become president. Thats Covid got Mexico too. Nah that’s fucking awful I’m graduating year late Kinda shows whats always mind thats best insult. grew pretty rough neighborhood parents comply public school police would typically pick kids take school.

I would assume parents let school know homeschooling? Government support USA, Simple Yeah don’t doubt will, doubt easy certain homemade masks made way. Sweden, people wear masks normally, they're hard get hold of. 

I actually flew plane couple weeks back, one making fuzz wear mask one American guy plane lol. almost scientifically impossible herd immunity reached 2.5% population infected. Now, yes, number probably much higher asymptomatic patients never got tested, still think would enough reach threshold. decrease increased preventative measures mask mandates restrictions, herd immunity. gonna argue that. Automation stands take lot medical jobs. don’t really see anyone shielded. Either find something super specialized something hands computer algorithm can’t mimic. I’m republican I’m ready vote someone trump office, people don’t wear mask idiots. It’s “rights” it’s what’s right staying safe keeping others safe. (1) statewide, Florida testing way down, *and* (2) USA made decision bypass CDC review statewide data. 

It seems like linked FUBAR decision. Literally soon CDC stopped reviewing data, COVID growth Sun Belt became linear rather exponential. Sun Belt exactly made major reforms lately top stop spread. 

The decision bypass CDC made teeth resistence also makes real sense. it? 


Knowing moral character certain people, hard shake feeling corrupt move. problem many parents single parents don’t help families especially pandemic. kids home, can’t go work. can’t go work, can’t pay rent, can’t buy food, etc. Thats town 10 days get results, that's crazy youtube channel belongs doctor one many blew whistle Sweden's active euthanasia elderly.

For example let's say Muslim bio-terrorist released COVID-19 Chinese wet-market revenge Uyghur re-education camps. would human enemy, hated one (Muslim) modern times due modern Islamic terrorism, response would much different, especially America. Holy shit. whole new unprecedented level Karen. punkd guy know read? consensus experts work. did, would know now, it’d widely used standard course treatment.

It’s doubtful parents convinced subsequent argument provide. swollen brain. Wow (the victim) 10 kids? Honestly spoke volumes type person is. worst worst. Sorry late reply thought might find interesting!

Looks like spanish flu infection rate never reached levels would needed herd immunity factors caused die down.  Jesus Christ probably watching this, probably dissapointed. think Man gave life us, look give return. I'm absolutely going restaurant bar there's vaccine. Especially industry (live entertainment/events) last get back normal I'm saving every penny can. making joke time zones cause like 11 read saying almost 5 true iteration Christianity I’m acquainted with. There’s Commandment prohibiting making “graven images” interpreted forbidding creation depiction God, *hasn’t* interpreted way Christianity centuries, ever. general consensus means “No idolatry,” say “Don’t make something human hands worship *it* though God.”

I think might thinking Islam? Images God Prophet forbidden Islam that’s never see icons statues etc. That’s also it’s always news event whenever artist depicts Muhammad (think political cartoon situation years back, South Park, etc).

Christianity chock-full depictions God Jesus Mary everyone else. Sistine Chapel, Last Supper, basically 90% art Middle Ages Renaissance. Catholic crosses actually depict figure Christ hanging crucified, hence name “crucifix.”

I think you’re mixed here, I’m wrong I’m happy hear flavor Christianity bans images God Jesus.

Also, Jesus Jew Nazareth, place still exists. Whatever looked like, think safely say *not* look like Kenny Loggins, pictures American churches would us believe. there's risk increase TB kill people covid. know, that's rich countries, so....

It amusing see 3 6 managers get fired cheating credit card apps (not time, top 4 managers store aka ones actually power). kohls really cared cheating would 6/6.

I mostly blame corporate... much manager metrics based credit card apps. suspect became get X else fired results pushing people eventually fails actually getting many corporate wants near impossible start cheating (giving discounts shouldn't, family/friends apply present, lying credit card application, even flat identity theft). can't understand people saying there's proof outdoor protests cause significant spread virus also think events like allowed. kids leases. terrible investment, really. airborne means tiny, aerosolized droplets. like said, micro-droplets.

But yes, that's likely issue. New Jersey training area Florida. know many crazy people know move Florida eventually? New Jersians sorry Florida twat cocoon. ""protests large gatherings people!""

is reality? get grip meant school you’re still jackass. Instead politely stating know. shot straight elitist asshole, deleting comments, still throwing personal attacks people, countries whole.

It’s HIPAA says employers can’t disclose tested positive, it’s Americans Disabilities act. apologies wrong information.

I've heard years, think first encountered kid one version ""jingle bells, batman smells"" songs. US really providing accurate date since WH took collecting data? art, fun! Hahahahahah lol, I’m Northern Ireland, didn’t vote Corbyn 😂! Also, America REALLY let pandemic, leader shown useless actually like making data up? Worked Chelsea Corona nearly ten years. feel gotten worse even since 2018. Nearly every single bodega used frequent work within 3 block radius closed down. Even pharmacies. either go CVS 7/11 7th 21st 22nd. Yes course subtract loss excess deaths. Covid kills someone indirect reason (like hospital full heart attack) also save someone (because drive work otherwise would accident).

In end virtually certain Covid increases total death rate way lowers reasons, count factors that's science, pushing agenda. Science objective. love vast majorities posts trying return item rather attempted murder woman committed. hearing came back, hear less ringing result? doctor tell something (other physical therapy)? RICO? Also sounds like something they'd sell IKEA. Fucking airtight logic right there, friend. Thanks that, people seem forget electrostatic interactions focus sheer size.

I've since John's Creek John's Creek shop stores mainly Jones bridge Rd Peachtree pkway (not John's Creek) ppl wearing masks (most stopped back late may/June, resumed masks).

Despite living one top neighborhoods here, everyone affected financially conservative based neighbors know talked to. grew Johns Creek, it’s surprise it’s hardest hit city Fulton County.


The virus even bad here. Zero clue saying talking about. literally Emory John's Creek last week saying packed overcrowded like ATL hospitals covid patients. 

Not sure talk think know single person n traveling anytime past 3-4 months. includes middle high school kids grew here. like parents area, financials order bit easier life regard

We post irony midst lethal anti-intellectual movement studied years sense bewilderment despair. folks make mc carthy red scare phenomenon pale comparison depth ignorance lack compassion large swath American polity. I’m Langeland right now. There’s copious amounts Germans Langeland Ærø, arriving pleasure boats cars. far I’ve seen Swedes. way saw one Swedish car took towards Rødby probably heading Germany. don’t think need worry much Swedes. think six night stay rule defers them. Soon, rich able afford stay home high questioned also office, isolated everyone else business anyway matter. 

All people current government cares fine they've already isolated years hospitals plenty time get ready

But businesses, anarcho-capitalism, zero financial incentive get ready.

The thing hurting hospitals right cancel boob jobs due annoying coronavirus pandemic. Also; preferred parking plastic surgeons blocked damn refrigerated trucks. can't even pass another stimulus plan, push open schools federal reserve pushing another lockdown? Lots talk Well I'm sorry hear that. time market shift. Sadly Democrats left leaning peoples wear masks either. 

Combination conspiracy prone personalities low intelligence. Ha! true. went office first time weeks dress culture gone traditional business casual golf polo, nice shorts loafers flip-flops. US undercounting, relative excess deaths, similar degree UK, Spain Italy. 

Whereas Sweden Ireland Belgium, covid count excess death count almost identical, course places like NZ Australia much East Asia measurable excess deaths even compare.

The worst undercounting appears happening developing nations like Brazil, Mexico, Iran, South Africa, Ecuador, Peru, etc, excess deaths appear well twice three times official Covid counts. People suffer CFS autoimmune/chronic issues constantly told heads, tiredness, lazy, etc. trouble taken seriously. That's case. Yes, internet hypochondria thing, assume everyone claiming illness imagining it. Heck, people died turned away hospitals COVID told ""just anxiety"". Yes, morons I’m gonna say wouldn’t upset COVID took them. It’s August. I’m assuming people getting less colds/flus/viruses Covid, people aren’t getting symptoms would compel get tested. people aren’t gonna go get tested funsies. 

If figure there’s 8% positive rate, means 92% people cough sore throat whatever something else. Well, August, makes sense would less people. Plus, it’s inconceivable believe Covid rates could dropping. Canada? think, Texas point overwhelmed places decided send home people lowest chance survival.

Instead quarantining like would could, due lack resources sending people home die horrible, suffocating deaths risking infecting anyone might take care them.

Fuck that. ""We're sending home die. options die isolated alone, risk health lives loved ones die anyways."" Yeah don’t know honestly. makes sense numbers start flatten decline eventually. It’s actually works. It’s impossible increase forever you’re talking virus. 

Is really surprising though? Donald trump started wearing mask, stores making masks mandated. point numbers won’t keep increasing. It’s works. find strange people subreddit trying ignore it. 8 1 pm

Drive ins fine niche market older movies, would pretty much impossible new releases. Theaters' primary source revenue concessions, since give much tickets studios, people bring much junk food want cars. Plus, showtimes would drastically reduced (forget matinees summer), theaters would charge exorbitant amound per car Thats recently, brainwashed right wing news. Right wing news literally makes dumber. think end game Democrats? point, kinda accept, kids suffer, education-wise. 

Either schools equipped remote-schooling parents able home-school. America-only problem. E.G. Germany problems. put lot money education.


IMO whole generation kids suffer worldwide. something accept, since worldwide epidemic one-of-a-kind thing. Maybe goverments learn somehow. Yeah, don’t get decided. arbitrary. This. Honestly tech companies last 5 years used platforms explore cities existing infrastructure, city councils governments paid for. would international students required military service? country? problem many facilities ancillary services outdoors.

Maybe area traffic around picked back May seemed less average since then. wish streets empty see online.  Averages work like that. understand totally applicable situation? They're trying convince people take action dangerous lying (aka gaslighting situation) telling dangerous.

That's regular lie.  Telling someone something that's true obtain desired outcome.

Okay buddy. I'm British. want know thoughts us politics candidates corrupt freaks show serious signs dementia. like said can't blamed that. 

It's quite interesting immediately try tie political party I've made statements statistics. considered part problem. fall trap politicising health issue. elites might want stoop low. misinformation, ship question left single port returned back port expedition over.. recent YMCA summer camp Georgia turning covid-19 cluster colony scare everyone opening schools would like: results available 344 people 260 — three-quarters — positive.

Legit question: can't schools skip year school start back fall 2021? 

I mean sort time table deadline kids need graduate by? Instead graduating 18 teens would graduating 19 like big deal? May 2020 graduated 10th grade fall 2021 begin 11th...I really see problems drawbacks - see positives many lives parents,teachers,kids,and school faculty would saved likely catch covid-19 otherwise. Also, “Drink barrel forgettin’.” 😜 would argue extreme minority, spread far. substantial portion US still going restaurants, hanging friends, letting kids play others playground. glass wine dinner fine driving home

No, not. Still lie. would said that, bet number anti-maskers would halved. first week maybe? everyone sitting home baking banana bread, puzzles Nintendo Switches sold out, EVERYTHING closed?

I thought might work. Maybe everyone get it. couple times go roads empty. thought working first.

Then saw cracks system. fix them. started reopening stuff second numbers started lower. give us idea might be? right, course, there's lot basic functions human body understand. point matter. Even there's possibility transmission may drop without intervention, vanishingly small probability according know enter equation we're trying craft policy. Uh yeah shit lot predictions incorrect, stay safe reduce spread don’t get consumed craziness reported news, truth rarely scary interesting try portray Emoji allowed titles.

Yep... exactly, guy. know masks protect people, infectious disease expert, he’s IDIOT. agree saying chime in, lot daycares open (I know it’s state dependent lot states view us essential therefore it’s choice close not). work one open don’t plan closing. way would close Covid going around even that’s big considering bunch different factors involving parents actually taking sick children get tested testing even available timely manner.

So parents daycares fall back (again state dependent) assuming there’s availability local daycares, that’s still big money lot households aren’t used spending year round can’t afford. mention obviously level education going school. Anyway end rant totally get saying. I’ve worried exact thing. It’s mess, feels though there’s good solution times 😕 believe clear one part relevant here. governor's authority case comes law passed state legislatures expressly gives power governor (though cases may stem state constitution). 

As reason make law keep mandate, temporary makes sense go channel emergency measure regular law. point giving emergency powers executive executive act faster legislatures can, thus appropriate respond emergencies. checks place legislatures remove governors' mandates fact felt gone far power. get app quickly, also many people possible, need make platforms OS versions largest user base. That's they've done here. 

Otherwise holding back majority order include minority. look [shape looks like cases started spiking June 15, deaths July 7. 3 week lag, seem peak recently 3x (75k/ day peek July 24). outbreak rate grows 6w. means 3w deaths peek 3k/day. We’re currently 1500/day. 30 x 2250 = 67,500. 🤷🏼‍♂️ said finished high school year.

Either way, nice answers?

It feels like really hardest battle. \~3,000 died 9/11, plenty scary.

I making point based said number deaths much higher 9/11, still ""scary""

You said that's because, even though lots people dying, people dying old.

But we've ""young"" people die, young people continuing die died 9/11.

I agree fact change anyone's kneejerk opinion disaster. explaining made point ""4,000"" number did. killing black people race America....
Lets massive protest designed get blacks streets packed closely together possible. 
We call black lives matter sit back watch virus spread. Drunk driving better analogy endangers people addition driver. guess accept, generation kids kinda ""fucked"". disadvantage. world-wide pandemic unique case. 

American alone this. Kids worldwide suffer.  like shitty U.S. MBAs sent jobs overseas, politicians 2nd place shit list though, U.S. citizens 3rd Exactly

**and let’s even get started COST child care**. Temporarily banned /r/Portugal track #3 cause death US year.

So saying two things deserve attention virus. Ok, care Well, since reporting rerouted HHS instead CDC, numbers verifiable. Trump control narrative. Let hospitals report internation websites see happens I'm sympathetic parents need child care, open schools child care. Use something else. half churches empty week took 10 kids would give us lot room spread out.

The worry kids' education on-point. huge risks sending kids school. 

Especially kids 10, looks like less likely adults *infect* people even get sick.

Links read care: Grew Cumming, live Johns Creek. It’s incredible number people see don’t wear masks. 

I’m disappointed fellow Georgians refuse act kindness empathy. feel ashamed deeply saddened people taking pandemic seriously. 

My heart goes young man lost parents. seems like parents raised well, breaks heart lost parents within days other. Thank much comment. ""..more half 402 patients monitored treated virus experienced least one disorders proportion severity inflammation disease. ""

The link inflammation depression studied lot. Hopefully new treatments inflammation pandemic turns something helps mental health disorders.  Wow, I'm amazed managed read entire article write comment less two minutes. impressive indeed. Plague doctors ""bring dead"" guy Monty Python Holy Grail going huge costumes Halloween :-( No. don't.

""11,000 people die every week"" *not* ""An average 11,000 people die every week."" 11K die every week month, anticipate actual average *far* higher 11K, assuming plateau roughly number Week 1. us finish month average weekly count 11K, there's reason week 9K 10K whatever number 11K. 

Now, *mean* latter rather former? Possibly. People use imprecise language time. I'm responding *said*, assume they, instead, actually meant. did, fact, mean ""average weekly death count,"" 11,000 entirely possible. Might even little low, based upon pace we're right now. saying deserved smoked, drank exercise? commenter means big cities generally pay apartments convenience community  located....with said, fuck corporate property management companies ridiculous rent prices Lots poon free entry parties, free food, etc. Benefits local celebrity status. start large, keep finding other.

Awesome video. ""Those numbers seem low. countries could beat make us look bad. need better show winning. Wait, talking about?"" -government probably would ease laws regulating one dangerouns harmful drugs around? think wearing mask required indoors nationwide, honesty masks aren’t worn everywhere world.

If we’re incredibly honest big big big difference America countries Americans gathered world record numbers several weeks straight pandemic.

I know media tends say protests didn’t massive effect numbers that’s just.... hard believe. see ton masks protests. what, close inevitably spikes again? That’s 6x mortgage. little mind blown rent gotten high areas. Two years paying rent would house outright. There’s lot folks come sub bring protests, guise public health, make weird point protesting bad. 

We get it. hate protesters. 

It’s also clear folks hate science, considering there’s lot evidence indicating BLM protests didn’t spread COVID. It’s almost like protesters wore masks. least listen podcast start fighting it. People love jump pre-conceived opinions. Come OP, know better. stories *Americans* stupid get upvotes Except one side waited last week negotiate months it. Same. Parents/teachers asked case count updates school. district said providing it. said disruptive &amp; reporting obligation health dept. 

So...nothing see here. safe. Send kids school.  Where's spike NYC then? Remember 

Infected mean symptoms appear
Infected mean sick
Sick imply hospitalised 
Hospitalised imply dead know downvoted. literally said admitted lying. tough job. I'm glad someone keeping track. Wish general public cared much.

- Man lunch break 4 weeks, RN Yep... student college, I'm struggling also, idea going look like 3 weeks, many unknowns, cant get job idea schedule going like, dont even know living campus. course tuition staying same. people down-play hundreds thousands Corona virus deaths per day, train crash killed 20 people would investigation demands new safety laws people would fired. Multiple states caught New York's total case counts, yet hit brakes. like testing much consolation NY super overloaded probably 80% people covid never got tested.

It's absolutely terrifying deaths lag behind infections 3-4 weeks. going get lot worse gets better. support propaganda? Admitting reinfection real make situation grime. Unless country riots goes general strike, going happen. see way around it. Hundreds thousands die starvation third world countries due economic shutdown one cares guess... flu argument based flu death rate, near widespread COVID is. People use comparison explain feel safe personally article health care workers losing lives. awful. People need compassion health care workers. That’s 9/11s per week ...and Dr. visit costs $150 (not free) so?

The health code laws bind restaurants exist mitigate food contamination protect patrons illness death.

The mask policies exist mitigate air contamination protect patrons illness death. I'm point I'm gonna say fuck people care it, lost someone came back whine it. Just, fuck people Definitely cannot afford option. even did, would take money desperately need us trip. Also nowhere else go upon return, might end staging tent woods somewhere I’m NJ. awful March-May. feel sooo much safer now. I’m basically watching rest country horror. 

I’m worried 2nd wave though schools opening expect anxiety go back September. Help! looking ""statistics"" political way fit political agenda, disgusting reason US throughout world's laughingstock. discourse likes you. She'll fine! worry, Republicans allow benefit Estate tax! first 11.5 million dollars inheritance touched! feel defeated looking numbers. Toronto, 4th populous city North America, reported 9 cases yesterday. things open now. US, here, looks like raging dumpster fire sea shining sea. there's reason lack political right thing. 

I understand Americans absolutely furious. prominent politicians seem going business usual. Nobody's feet held fire would say strong case negligent homicide national scale. Yeah Canada relying fucking China vaccines. worry, execs fine!

queue health insurance bailout... truly disgusting. Well, maybe eye-opener anyone industry. Maybe good people realize waiter server full-time employment adult. giant loop thing qualified waiter server waiter server. Please confirm castrated. EXACT thoughts except last one. 

Typical political differences aside, horrified realized early March we'd either need another impeachment removal 25th Amendment order avoid catastrophe. crazy thing is, actually thought leaders might come realization act. course feel stupid even thinking might. Theres point, reddit stops counting -15 so. Pay wall. state economy never fully recover (it feels like anyway) since 2008 recession. I’m 30 finally getting livable wage. People little compassion right now.  People want go bars gyms get taken care Yeah US don’t insurance basically go bankrupt medical condition Yeah type stuff zero affect property value./

[local NY news data shows kids spread virus.

But I’m fine teachers working, long don’t get paid. complain that. joyfully get repeat mantra tards: “you care economy lives!?” Boy doozy fall! Judging state things today, jobs well though they? course rich kids face consequences. That's *works!* I'm literally even kidding. There's much depravity crime rich neighborhoods poor ones, gets handled ""quietly"" upset property values. need context specific lie Fauci told public.

I mean could google seem like already drank kool-aid looking opinion changed, anyway. really pathetic people run guys defense. Lots that. Oh no. live Arizona ??? Considering 2020 forced cancel/postpone planned beach holiday sunshine cocktails instead substitute getting drunk couch soft glow television... one family. many lost enough enough? Go ahead point article title mentions higher lethality

What absolute useless fear mongering douchebag Yes, also PPE frontline healthcare workers, 50 million stockpile expired. government trying cover ass desperation lied Canadians could buy retail masks since failed hard prepared pandemic. 

They initially masks spreading misinformation dissuade people using purchasing them. took months reverse idiotic messaging then, many people already convinced. like spread lie online, spreads faster better correction lie. could keep going fund schools federal instead state level. Equally per student.

Please no... exception rule rather rule itself. someone long term relationship primary teacher worked several years k-12 education, kids first several years education still need consistent guidance flourish. Even large numbers kids still fall behind. 

You mention went school first portion day came home parents leave work. imagine supervision guidance first 5 hours day coming home empty house. best kids working parents did. Half day adult supervision. Kids parents work odd hours like did, without school. potentially 14 hours alone day. Meme. even send home going quarantine full 2 weeks?  Foreshadowing... think bound crash $1 trillion Covid-19 stimulus relief that's held right going somewhere know going citizens. would think long government pouring trillions corporations stock market safe least November 3. Wouldn’t government/school system parents. schools reopened parents refuse send kid school I’m pretty sure get trouble that. Hey sound identical typical marketing campaign. Almost like they're brainwashing effect people. We're fucked dishonest tool, see headlines anywhere new strain lethal  Welp. remember Election Day. think he's saying people flu covid twice likely sneezing/ runny nose symptoms thereby increasing transmission risk. USA count even used. 10-14 day waits (in urban areas) count them? Counting would lower case fatality rates true. Seems something governor would want considering that's measurement keeping economy rolling not. ""U.S. deaths nearly 180,000 higher usual three-month period spanning the coronavirus outbreak, according report Wednesday.

## Abstract

An essential mechanism SARS-CoV-1 -2 infection begins viral spike protein binding human receptor protein angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). describe stepwise engineering approach generate set affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection cells. optimized receptor traps tightly bind receptor binding domain (RBD) viral spike protein prevent entry host cells. first computationally designed ACE2-RBD interface using two-stage flexible protein backbone design process improved affinity RBD 12-fold. designed receptor variants affinity matured additional 14-fold random mutagenesis selection using yeast surface display. highest affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes bound RBD 170-fold tightly wild-type ACE2. addition natural ACE2 collectrin domain fusion human Fc domain increased stabilization avidity, optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentivirus authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) tens ng/ml range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer promising route fighting infections SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-utilizing coronaviruses, key advantage viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry. Moreover, traps pre- designed viruses known entry receptors faster therapeutic response without need neutralizing antibodies isolated generated convalescent patients. expect use unlimited conspiracy powers like, win elections something. condolences go him. it’s tough lose even one parent Source 1: three models, one shows majority cases result presymptomatic asymptomatic carriers possible. actually favour position.

Source 2: highest estimate proportion infections caused asymptomatic carriers 30 percent. supports argument too! Given 2 categories (asymptomatic presymptomatic symptomatic) simple maths equation (100-30) find majority infections caused symptomatic carriers.

Source 3: doesn’t talk much asymptomatic presymptomatic people 


Source 4: data given presymptomatic asymptomatic spread 44 percent. Since asymptomatic, presymptomatic symptomatic subtract 44 100 find 56 percent must symptomatic. That’s majority. supports point.

Source 5: great! shame doesn’t cite form study!

Source 6: says actually fucking clue proportion spread caused asymptomatic carriers. Doesn’t say it’s common.

So one sources supported argument, interview. actual studies supported arguments. Might suggest work reading comprehension? Please? Another point cities mine that’s impossible majority year. I’m cold area Canada, winter like 6 months long here. -20 Celsius every day I’m tryna go Like, vaporizers? made it? wonder bad.. good know live name I’m sure would players don’t ask full pay. What’s likelihood happening Success predetermined zip code. Agreed. I'm sure every organization level managerial bloat think lot people understand exists first place - lot easier ask 1 person 10 people ask 10 people they're doing. I'm sure around area (and I've seen online) public schools (elementary - high) going back least partially. area particular 3-4 days/week classroom, 1-2 virtual.. help. think lot schools offered completely virtual options people work stuck making horrible decision. Well testing, test negative today catch virus tomorrow. kinda mute.. mean defended Russia arming Taliban citing support local Afgans Cold War. good thing never visit cesspool then. 

Make permanent. realize difficult people Autism? I'm one them. world never even different normal. us homosapiens. let Pinky &amp; Brain finally get want! Yes, course, *that*... think that! absolutely stop paying attention global pandemic focus resources heart disease!

But seriously, refuse believe stupid. I’m Canada booked round trip flight Phoenix November see family - worth risks. survey way off, peers (around 30) willing travel soon, already it... especially re: interprovincial travel - yeah right. Depends subnet in... Oh, starting up. many still going face face matter days. nobody said xenophobic Chinese boogeyman. look vancouver. huge issue overseas buyers driving housing market CA. Re-read post. literally refuted comment already. That's said.

It's another communicable disease, close schools entire economy various ones (bird/swine flus, seasonal influenza, etc). one much lethality, what's justification?

You 99.74% chance surviving COVID, according CDC. let's let half economy shit bed go straight 40+ million people unemployed, not.   Okay. add ""another person on-site make sure kids work.""

If determined fail, can't stop you. Lol. Hospitals are, large, handling cases fine. anger, pointing dishonest asshole are

You send fucking shit 'more lethal' article title

You give one fucking quote single scientist saying virus lethal

Go ahead, I'm still waiting evidence besides ""tHaT's wAy fEeL""

Worthless disgusting fearmongering piece shit, idiot posting stupid shit describes tee Seeing much infected (and probably times more) seems every news sub hand selected people outliers.

If bothered look study, available data indicates 40% cases develop ARDS 20% severe. That's far ""few outliers"" claim. 18 million total cases worldwide, still looking 3.6 million-7.2 million people form lung damage. Statistically people survive heal again.

That statement mean much. Covid-19 happened 49% death rate would still extremely bad. Let's see happens winter. agree financial literacy needs focused traditional education, again, change stats. I'm expert fields, also look culture consumerism psychology. People marketed 24/7. think expose people culture consistently make good financial decisions? going happen. 

32K get living wage populated areas. Populated areas jobs are. That's people live debt. That's people one crisis away losing everything. Many people would living paycheck paycheck even practiced perfect financial discipline. People, general, disciplined. response pandemic good example that. also sort beside point. Even universal healthcare systems, care paid magic fairy dust. significant percentage population develop chronic illness would still devastating strain system. sort crowdfunding him. Id love donate. explained yet doctors fell windows? do, I'd take information coming Russia gigantic grain salt. 40k/month 12 months almost 1 million 2 years stop it. Aztecs died? Tallinger published patients medical journal online without consent.... Also working doctor, back published first video either. leave job. says 12th may """"Mina kollegor anmäler mig för sekretessbrott trots att jag inte arbetade som läkare utan privatperson när jag publicerade videon."" english ""My colleagues report breach confidentiality even though work doctor private person published video.""

Thought might want know

EDIT: newspaper article leaking patients journal swedish friends easily able find information flashback him. whole thread there. eating masks on..? Hope recovers. Dehumanizing gaslighting. Articles like cause familiar feeling: disappointment, surprise. not. Atleast reality. Wth going sub? many times going said again? Sweden even top 20 weird seeing many redditors eating shady goverments numbers withouth questioning 5,334 registered covid deaths 15/7 5,322 excess US 114,038 registered covid deaths 130,546 excess deaths reference, 15/7 Spain 28,180 registered covid deaths 43,900 excess deaths meaning might missed registering 40% covid Moscow registered covid deaths: 3,796, excess deaths registered covid deaths: 9,647, excess deaths City registered covid deaths: 6,341, excess deaths saying purpose btw, stating fact things Man, taking measures something bad happens. Really sucks, least something guess. Image true death toll America. New York I'd consider bare minimum sane guidelines, namely clear set conditions grounds re-closing (school happens [only ""infection rate remains 3 percent seven-day rolling average""). I'm worried states' leaders kind discipline, close becomes obvious needed close two weeks ago. feel fine high fever? Crime Pays Botany fantastic youtube channel always keep saying this. really critical schools remain open, government everything help schools instead stomping feet yelling schools it? Makes sense me.

If money lost kids going school far exceeds cost properly set schools safe return, make happen. want kids school feel get better education way, plus actually look job. way sending kids way things going. # FAKE DATA HHS long financial transactions continue conducted USD case. opinion count fact. Covid flu sound foolish.

If proper lockdown initially could like nations point. Again, going say party ""hates poor"" could equally argue party cares poor people's vote actual well-being success.

If true, places like Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago, others way are. shithole cities despite ""champions poor"" running it? GOP also fucked Flint's water supply let stay like many years?

And trying reduce one party saying ""virus fake"" accurate saying party bunch Marxists. thought America reporting control narrative masses? article make think decades everyone confined country? know accepted scientific fact yet, definitely news, people talking since April. None focuses education (“if we’re lucky, paying attention assignments” doesn’t inspire lot courage). I've heard guy before. He's part charismatic/new apostolic/Benny Hinn type movement. He'll slay spirit free viruses!

We've got local church live goes events convinced prayed church, virus (which believe hoax begin with) touch them. I'm waiting one catch it. Taiwan, straight stopped publishing death figures people noticed 20% YoY increase. proceeded run global ad campaign promoting successful were, one DW reporter went ask how, answer give ""we asked people wear masks indoors"", backdrop half people wearing lol Gonna disagree US test capacity. atrocious. Turnaround times two weeks many people. ""The psychiatric consequences COVID-19 caused immune response virus psychological stress factors stigma, social isolation worries infecting others, said.""

Perhaps requiring people socially isolated, stigmatizing get sick saying direct cause another's death transmitting virus harm good. 

How shocking/s Need better source. Hopefully someone investigate print English paper, auto translation pretty bad. large bill attached. There's difference here. issue hand opinion issue. efficacy HCQ opinion issue. MIL nurse high risk posts stuff regarding virus. saw one posted morning someone put ""It'll Nov. 4."" dumb still thinking point? assholes saying stuff like beginning. It’s soothe terror calling others doomers you’re gonna debunk fact gdp?  doesn’t start DeSantis. mandatory vaccines country entire life. would gotten anyways even mandatory, look things idiot. teach kids medicine? Like, for?

As kid knew bad-tasting stuff forced take sick. association thought pills/liquids taste really really bad.

Also I'm pretty sure place hard reach places. dying truckload

There’s depression / mental illnesses people “born with” — kinds run families.

Then “mental illnesses” like ones here, mind 100% understandable expected responses recent traumatic experience. 

People especially ventilators get PTSD. read experience, you’ll see why.

And people, especially previously healthy, find shattering sick. sick quite long time (so far). may never experienced invalid before. It’s shock.

Also “depression” commonly accompanies viruses. plays function similar to, say, fever, serves biological need: keeps wanting isolate, get bed, want sleep lot. good virus.

And OCD: totally understand temporary coping mechanism. Insomnia: understandable; shocking experience process. Anxiety — absolutely understandable.

I see different class — likely, temporary ways human use process Covid-19 experience. “pathological” all.

* study masks fabrics goes low 10 nanometers. coronavirus average size around 125nm. looking less 300nm filtration shows efficacy there. best evidence/data says spreads attaching water droplets increases size significantly (to total size around 1000 nanometers). 

In addition data shows efficacy masks coronavirus also question exposure concentration. far I've seen scientific literature suggests exposure / concentration get, lethal infection/response.

So all, even virus airborne even efficacy masks 125 nanometers low, still better wearing mask... according data suggests right now. too. joke cope.  got mine DXL. Amazingly comfy super high quality. liked larger size move around talk, lot work.

Reality doesn’t matter. got narrative guess.

Take care. data back up? truth, community spread much rampant Sweden late February/early March rest Scandinavia, much similar Belgium Denmark Norway. Deaths Sweden Denmark peaked roughly time (Sweden little bit behind Denmark), around 3,5 weeks first batch measures imposed. people died point infected measures instated. Sweden peaked ~115 dead/day, Denmark ~20. suggests much spread Sweden early March Denmark. 

Why spread much greater Sweden (mostly driven Stockholm) don’t really know. Perhaps fact Stockholm school break week 9, maybe something else. 

I also want point Swedish interventions seems pretty successful bending rate infection, rate decline hospitalizations deaths slower countries, affected death statistics lot. level infection, voluntary measures weren’t enough quickly bend curve, unfortunately. NCL Norwegian Cruise Line need many doses initially skepticism around vaccine side effects. standard of: whose position would take, theirs. lot end bankrupt directionless left basically career squandered moderate windfall least half decade behind you. I’m saying feel sorry them; don’t think average NFL player anything jealous over. that’s even risks decade impacts CTE might get later life. specific football btw: risk, turn less guarantee contracts anyone major sport. think kind sucks large portion league (besides glory pro year two... many year might half career. That’s original point: kids indeed need money) CTE comes getting hit saying owners dont think people human CTE problem, completely ignoring fact play want risk getting CTE. hwy see human play. give 50+ mil contract Agreed! considering we're explicitly told Jesus came served, serve; Christians considering best serve fellow humans themselves. includes simple thing wearing mask!

Hoping get pandemic together safely, friend! I’ve said before, imagine powerful democrats must be, president whitehouse, majority one house, yet create world wide hoax everyone believes. 

Then look republicans. ton power complaining everything unfair them. bad bunch fuckups they? That’s actually low end recreational vehicles. Campers boats easily run hundred grand oftentimes come loans 15 years. used much less often “the weekends”. 

ATVs UTVs average 15-20k can’t even driven road (in vast majority places). 

There entire industries built around parts accessories services specific vehicles supplemental industries those. hurting quite while, think it’s specifically felt supporting industries v-twin market (harleys). 

Honestly feel bad lot folks HD.

maybe it’s time change it? actually anything substantive say counter arguments going keep repeating sentence over?   I'd bet rise influence due rise funding, funding coming outside America. Also large swaths country regularly 90 summer several months school year. Obviously, parents home school perfect scenario ""only public education"" people fit in?

First foremost, public education virtual outstanding quality, we'd less homeschooling pandemic.

Second, see homeschooling incompatible statements. I'm talking one well funded flexible public education program. parents want instructors remote learning, think access stipends funding help ensure this.

But charter school private school need make sure understand distinctions Also, private institutions existed 100+ years?

Literally whatever want. Community centers, free tutoring space, converting housing first initiatives.

I care little self improvement private institutions feel. See kids, devil comes middle night makes go pee, forgot wash hands sinning ways devil gave china AIDS. Worse dementia addled Parsons? Nah. Anyone spends time sub reads misinformation daily basis that's poor translation.

Well, also compare measures governments extent. 

...and still possible make educated calculations reduced car accident.

E.g. 

take average care deaths period - actual car deaths period

You basically everything.

Statistics quite powerful regard.


Do perfect numbers? No. get quite good estimation? Yes people like children paid taxes 40+ years. I'd like refund, then. fucked. I'm tired damn anti-maskers ruining everything. need impose laws deal this. I'm tired ""muh freedom"" shit. PEOPLE DYING one town seems care. feel like people fuck stay home month two no, ""Gotta exercise rights American"". feel like literally thousands people dying sometimes temporary enforcement law crucial. source studies still underway? quick google search, found sources Canada saying pretty much thing below—none citing ongoing studies point. 

From article: Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary health human services, said NBC News' ""Meet Press"" ""from public health standpoint, first, hydroxychloroquine looked promising"" ""this point time, there's five randomized control, placebo-controlled trials show benefit hydroxychloroquine."" 

Edit add—this using Covid, purposes.

Like said, I’m fine lots studies wherever scientific interest. But, I’m going start cherry picking studies sources suit narrative, that’s Trump’s thing. Theyre gonna walk away paid vacations. counting days kick back forget hungry, homeless American citizens left dead school district never said would let families know case greater 6 feet away 15 minutes. would alert ask ones within 6 feet quarantine. teacher isn’t allowed come within 6 feet anyone, let alone 15 minutes don’t ever quarantined! genius! worries! Yeah, PPE would mandatory minimise disruption... Americans entitled can’t give little freedom greater cause. It’s fucking motorcycle rally Nah fam people went cruise killed themselves. fucking stupid go cruise middle pandemic good riddance. feel sorry staff probably work support families guests? Hell nah. parts Texas, high school football practically religion. people stop going church stop going high school football games. Even kills everyone care about. Gov.

Im huge NFL fan, cant see lasting another 2 decades without major changes exactly kind arguments Holocaust deniers have. Oh believe Holohoax? brainwashed globalists jewry. know Zyklob B actually delousing agent? I'm failed jealous somebody, ad hom fallacies, since concrete arguments.

It's fallacious critique relies ad hominem attacks. comments character icing go back suck elon's dick, dude.

This hand, argument constantly make without addressing substance many arguments. dismiss arguments due alleged motivations one making case ad hominem fallacy.

You ignored every single argument made got completely wrong.

Why doesnt board fire isnt best guy job? Founders CEOs constantly let go. no, doesnt enough shares prevent happening.

Why engineers done him?

If money, rich companies people either?

If real argument belt, resort posting comments Nazism101?

Why think recommending someone reads fucking book brainwashed?

Can right anything promote defend deadliest regime history?

And no, question end dont invalidate criticism ad hominem sole argument, ignore good arguments pretend dont exist thinking composed entirely fallacies. ""arguments"" provided thread LITERALLY asks people paint negative light.

All I’ve done work grocery shop, got it. Masked entire time. Hand sanitizer day. hardly decent country left hasn’t universal healthcare. ""where someone forces vaccine early,""

Yes, either financial political reasons. would devastating health care years come forced vaccine early either work bad side effects (the swine flu vaccine 1976 comes mind). 

I'm surprised too, sure tweeted it. He's touting unwarrantedly optimistic treatments developments months. hope he's learned lesson. knows. again, second compared covid flu stopped reading, clearly understand severity what’s play 30 Nobel Laureates.

-biblical inaccuracies- many bible scholars believe earth made 8-10.000 years ago? Even though plethora evidence stating earth BILLIONS years old. 

-gods character: ever wonder stereotype “pissed, fire brimstone”? Old Testament , god written vastly different OT New Testament written centuries apart.

Sure shot went way high drill actual study article referring shows ineffective... study, large, contradict study.. larger study waited people admitted hospital.. earlier study said given early diagnosis benefits dropped RECOVERY Trial large, randomised controlled trial possible treatments patients admitted hospital COVID-19.

 article reference positive study.. said disregard study month Henry Ford Hospital System southeast Michigan found death rates 50% lower among patients treated hydroxychloroquine. study's authors noted drug posed safety problems. research criticized observational study – much less rigorous randomized trial – patients received hydroxychloroquine also got steroids shown clinically beneficial treating conclude Henry Ford study outlier, there’s kind confounder skewing data representing truth.”

 So, said used 2 drugs.. must ""some"" issue study... i.e. agree disregard it. Pier 1's still exist? “WRONG!! IT’S TEST MORE.” moron Penn Ave. you?  Apologies England. bit issue violent morons. Inaccurate, never said 'No transmission', said time enough evidence prove human human transmission *preliminary report*

And China confirmed human human transmission 1/20, given US 2 months prepare. US pretend never happened republicans made political issue homie say get deserve. 

The unfortunate ones poor health care workers endanger keep idiot alive, people tried stay safe got infected he's ASS. TBF called 'owners' 
(sarcasm) Hundreds schools thousands daycares were/are open saw outbreak. confident?

Thousands operate problem: nothing see here!!!! see dishing truth immediately full. People would ending lives (or maybe I’m projecting...) prematurely, ie NOW. I’m projecting I’m sure I’m one. It’s popular thing say here.  Hmm guess thats one way look it. interesting year see strategies worked best. malicious. Intent terrify victim too. county mediocre. Honestly based see people community numbers pretty great. think school every Indiana school holidays, announced yet. We're planning letting kids go, see friends, we're going stress need wearing masks almost 100% time. It’s testing /s Random plausible deniability asked they're testing why.

""We're testing two interaction one cabinet members, certainly it, totally *random*..."" Snitches get stitches Seems like anti-vaxxer ""logic"". Quote North Dallas Forty (Fictional movie Football, 1979): “We employees team, equipment.” lol okay buddy, good luck trying get people die. Americana Healthcare copay. Basically everything saves 20% whatever discount cost copay shitty insurance 2 week hospital stay source one site speak of? Vast majority homes rapid widespread transmission house unless patient isolated totally. Sheltering hurricane/tropical storm global pandemic fun. true^^^ sad honestly don’t know “correct” answer is, I’m happy let doctors duke labs clinical trials across world abandon see fit professional opinions.

All comment getting that, Giroir, Trump administration, saying something contradicts Trump saying. last week, Trump re-tweeted demon seed doctor (which watch video re-tweeted, she’s talking hydroxicloroquine cured 90% patients). 

The Trump Administration suffering lack cohesive plan lack cohesive messaging, one, many, examples. find dual sports incredibly loud obnoxious. live city motorbikes, they're among worst, worst drivers. 2 Harleys/similar young (mostly teens) wear helmets, mufflers, probably license. Loudest worst drivers 3. Ok I’ll bite. What’s point? look article, numbers actually pretty significant. There's big gap women men. percentage men believed conspiracies actually pretty worrisome - many near 50% men. lol broken.. GL life.. UK US far testing symptoms coronavirus wide varied standard practice tests conducted particularly wards.

The symptoms COVID wide, every single person comes hospital gets test. kind idiot actually writes kind article. logical paradigm perplexing...

To say thousands people gathered crowds social distancing wearing improperly wearing masks, many cases, help spread virus, quite ludicrous. It’s along lines “if don’t test less cases”. simply put, “if ignore evidence, evidence”

“The absence evidence evidence absence.”

There’s downside though, soon bubble “penetrated”, disease likely spread quickly within bubble. It’s horrific come we? Yes. we? No. Yup. Thinking guys hoping knock head soon. prepared extended. Boulware prophylactic study

You might well quote actual numbers: ""The incidence new illness compatible Covid-19 differ significantly participants receiving hydroxychloroquine (49 414 [11.8%]) receiving placebo (58 407 [14.3%])"" Also ""Two hospitalizations reported (one group). arrhythmias deaths occurred."" ultimately matter die directly indirectly virus? Either way, virus caused death  Mexico's idea btw. could lot reinfections. 

CDC theorizes actual cases 10 times reported numbers ( bases blood samples taken healthy patients ). So, good democrat beat years? June 2020: evidence re-infection

August 2020: seem anectodal evidence re-infection

September 2020: low percentage people get disease twice.

December 2020: Everybody careful, catch multiple times. daughter works retail shocked hear gets customers sometimes. Like would never EVER think store would refund item didn’t me. opened new package chicken bought grocery store rancid. never even crossed mind ask refund without hand show them. fuck wrong people... either working much least family watch them. can't take care kid without paying someone else every single day, kid?! like kid fix relationship; leaves everyone even messed up. I’d get tested sure. Lots people don’t develop fever Fucking hypocrites. testing masks allowed White House. telling nation it? ***created award winning #metoo activist BethAnn McLaughlin***

Is winning looks like now? fit whole station mouth way YOU. part, too. Please feel like alone this. You’re riding along state highway outside Bend, Oregon, pine trees zipping past. amounts backpacking gear luggage strapped behind side luggage. GPS tracking every position. 

You see random forest road cuts forest toward buttes miles away. 

You turn highway speed head road wild. idea encounter road throw way. 

You cut across streams, climb tops peaks, cut across last remains snow, camp random spot amazing view.

And took 20 minutes.

You don’t head back way came, that’s easy. look map appears might road take different highway. take it, end getting totally different highway think “Oh, road connects two highways crazy maze forest service roads!”

You flag intersection future exploring.

It’s funnest hobby I’ve ever had. want start saying field work claim opinions viable, I'm putting thoughts see others think. 

For theory make sense start assumption discover indeed reinfected virus based recent studies question.

My theory reason seeing varying levels illness recent studies proven sewage tests dating way back 2019 virus us longer initially thought. knowing people saying well pandemic start sooner? Perhaps happening assuming reinfection possible depending number times infected dictates ill based infection slowly damaging body. Say ppl first infection generally asymptomatic mildly ill, clears confusion ppl get sick don't. reach third even possibly four time infected people ending hospital serious complications due prior damage last boughts fighting off. 

Again expert way claiming facts theory true would fill lot blanks including different countries seeing varying degrees illness death. Places like Italy others Europe perhaps tourists hot spots already population go first second infections ppl third fourth hence seeing hospitalization death.

Thank taking time read this, put thoughts hopes people knowledge viruses could explain theory even possible.

Stories sewage Reviewed Study possibility hating people cannot avoided. white leftists hate wtf  According article, looks like broadly focused providing guaranteed income people currently struggling, also including larger swath people different economic situations - since goals help needy, well provide research data people's behavior changes given guaranteed income... ""steal"" kinda weird word use, since point guaranteed income give people money zero expectations... hope people largely still productive, use safety net - also people want work spend time however want, need resort crime order survive. next level stupid. fuck. think we've talking people refuse mask far this. exactly poor people get better schools: tax money follows better school. free, like public school majority African Americans support charter schools vouchers. way escape. say schools closing permanently?

When teachers sick, think teaching classes? even let use giftcards online, find store closed yet (40 minutes away) try find crap spend $50 went drain. hate giftcard gifts, give cash. humble 5 CAD bill... That's super expensive stadium even use first unsafe. think like $1 million fix it.  Anyway, house shopping, avoided district - high taxes (wonder why?) football first priority. adopted. tiny blue line ? stage find difficult get worried write manager tell that. mouth weapon. Sure. Whatever. stop undermining message, I'm saying. going convince people government STILL lying can't trusted. landed right place, support message. Please take virus seriously. Hard times make men hard

Hard men make good times

Good times make men soft 

Soft men make hard times.

Rinse repeat disagreed statement “People need fun life they’ll protest every little thing”. new comment blunt, don’t think able social main reason saw sooo many people marching. totally contributed amount people saw, along factors.

More people able show protest cause jobless due covid. People without jobs tend look government them—after watch news seeing George Floyd’s Breonna Taylor’s death, well rise cases America (all trump said it’s going “go away” summer, obviously national plan deal it) answer essentially going let people die. think that’s biggest contributor people angry. miserable bored what’s amplifying anger, it’s motivation like suggested first comment. Stupidity discounts Yeah working class isn’t getting paid millions millions dollars play fucking sport. shit don’t care Odell, nobody cares anybody. Certainly multi billion dollar companies.  Belgium Sweden micronations? That’s idea Good lord many Americans stupid. Grammar? That's big deal? Hahahaha alright then. Thank excusing yourself, appreciate it. Take care, stay safe reinfection wave coming near future.

You remember happens. tried signing COVID vaccine trial city. said eligible they're testing anybody autoimmune diseases, mild one (just causes mild skin irritation one spot). 

That's good well phase 1 2, end phase 3, tested people certain autoimmune diseases see safe receive. 

Some vaccines aren't.

I'm fine testing me, everyone else want that? supposed get vaccinated?

EDIT: I'm looking trying see maybe there's another location test people autoimmune diseases. That's concerning not. Idk wtf Lake Ozarks gaining lot notoriety pandemic Probably BLM rally.

So yes.. indeed taxed more. heck lot more. held accountable shit put us through. Good news, cancer patients shouldn’t walking middle nonsense cancer patient, less. chemo recently, common cold could end them... [More like element Deaths vary *lot* year year. can't use precise measurements.

If country several times many excess deaths official covid deaths (eg Ecuador, Peru), say reasonable certainty they're undercounting covid deaths lot. gap 10 20% either direction, might random variation. That's great positive experience. mom also single parent too, also graduated three degrees turned fine without exceptional amount difficulty pain CPS paid several visits home. experience map onto others.

You teach kids real life without neglecting them... also neglected watched whole lot Disney movies, mostly main characters also absent dead parents made feel better neglected. seem closing large number drive testing centers, thus drop testing, thus drop cases. Toughest? Yeah...right.

Sturgis interesting. 1918 pandemic called?.... Spanish flu.. come from?... Kansas. Chinese hegemony guaranteed outcome USA's continued (and accelerating) decline, especially given tensions China many neighbours (Japan India probably notably) increased anti-Chinese sentiment throughout western world. ignoring EU's potential gains power vacuum left USA. 

Also think understand I'm saying big chunk world Chinese hegemony would inherently worse, would lateral move. basically said?

Also another virus becomes par seasonal flu yearly seems like substantial issue. Yep! Way back March started “shutting down” figured US would choose ineffectual path half measures resulting economic strife high body count. Regretfully seem right. either/or chose both.

In July, friends went USA Taiwan. spent first two weeks quarantine (their local family’s spare bedroom). given mobile phone use quarantine someone would call least per day make sure everyone healthy everything needed. wouldn’t surprised tracking phone’s location. also interviewed family members ensure allowing quarantined family members leave house.

To encourage compliance, given temporary video streaming membership, food, beverages, masks thermometers. even given stipend help expenses came result quarantine.

Lastly, significant fine break quarantine: 1 million Taiwanese dollars (about $33,000 USD). think family also gets trouble allowing it.

Is this...

A) explaining bubbles 5 year old 

B)Trump explains plan Coronavirus like 5 year old Portraying hydroxychloroquine forbidden cure allows pro-Trump media blame anyone Trump coronavirus disaster.

How Forsythia? considered that? US third world country. Read post responded again. Childcare $10 hour matter rich poor are. paying less that. That's true. Someday die.... now, let's read respond posts. like incompetence government. lot countries managed get scientific information people without resorting sacrifice freedom speech. South Korea, New Zealand, Germany, name few.  Yeah couple KY, IN. Fun kids summer day year. would definitely rather watch stuff home. I'm sorry family's loss people transmit catch COVID19 protests? Undoubtedly. 

Did fact protests outside sizable portion participants wearing masks keep transmissions minimum? 

The evidence far seems suggest so. Spread like wildfire warm areas Spain too. knew spread fine warm temps long Trump said that. sure might make somewhat difference, knew going die summer like flu, experts saying early on.  think nightclubs, sport crowds crowds general soon become thing past family previously paying private daycare couple kids, lockdown longer pay daycare, $1500/MTH actually sounds reasonable. They'd use money previously spent daycare. People also realize collapse US gov net positive anyone, even close. 

Fascism military overreach going get worse. People want french-revolution style revolt, know shit actual impacts one. 👆  Truly effective lockdown requires sacrifice personal freedom,

Like groups ""parents"" protesting without masks, social distancing. Simple easy things help fight spread deadly virus. Normal/ sane people usually care tragic situations like this.. too. reflection you. total? good Many teachers pursuing type teaching insured spouse's insurance. wonder wore mask?

Man, want kids able go back school. I'm so.... disheartened I've given hope ever get rid thing. Good lord people insane shorts shirt. people know die could care less wore funeral long came. plants get electrolytes?!? 
We combination Idiocracy + Wall-E + kind movie like Contagion. Sad, true. still New York, like premium product. 

You actually sell best goods services, people believe they're worth price. We're even close NY level mortality despite cases states. way know many people really NY since antibody tests garbage. guess 50% city exposed given cases now. Sweden reckless approach seeing 10 deaths days. We're missing something virus immunity works IMO don’t think lmao people supposed believe Covid took break went church weekend certainly hope I'm mad nothing, told, screeners told specifically exclude accepting participants autoimmune disease. citation needed inability detect obvious sarcasm Reddit is, use antiquated phrase, fucking retarded half time. happens group that's large enough decent representation population large, eventually there's enough people there's almost always enough subset idiots completely miss point something. People make something like RICO act addressing type criminal behaviour. Btw., still astonished article, choice language mentally disturbed. That’s million dollar question ask hundred folks industry you’ll get hundred unique answers, opinion (though rider HD wishes bring fold) Keeping mind makes Harleys sell:

-make affordable entry level bike. sportster good start shave thousand price tag make bare bones. sportster power plant aesthetically pleasing miniature revo used Street 500 &amp; 750 models. revo better? Sure, need HD heartbeat. Looks better, sounds better, feels like Harley roll throttle. Revo feels like metric it’s part V-Rod never succeeded.

-reintroduce kind sport bike. Want put revolution use? Put bike made it. Buell (their last attempt) failed Erik Buell shitty business partner, bc market doesn’t exist. People want sport bike need American choice. could wholesale replace v-rod.

-make affordable less designer apparel. Ever seen price tags motor clothes? You’re paying almost three digits tacky items look like Ed Hardy wear cool (and that’s low bar cool start with).

-this one may controversial amongst HDer’s introduce practical marketing. Lots folks buy metrics bc don’t want cultural baggage comes Harley. Back HAWMC became household name Harleys sold fun practicality - costs almost nothing burn tank, overall price (or be) less car, someone kids practical owning 150cc scooter. Instead embraced outlaw-look-and-feel selling yuppie prices, cosplay jokes come from. Harley, you’re listening, *everything* doesn’t need skull. 

Anyway that’s would do. Maybe also replace CEO came PUMA someone from, don’t know, Polaris Yamaha. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article stone cutting board, turns horrible decoration lol Tough rocks. demand public schools. could created pods time. depraved indifference, defendant's conduct must 'so wanton, deficient moral sense concern, lacking regard life lives others, money. judge whether someone flee not, and/or threat anyone. moment bring money mix, poor people suffer, rich people get hook. chance, get antibiotic?

Not saying fact possibility.  ""Yea, dont need goddam testing, let die"" ;;; Trump tiny balls made salty gooey marshmellows. crazies NJ, that’s next level shit. deserves book thrown her. Um, asked doesn't. Read better Yeah, constantly read shit shocks much suck, pay less attention good parts. get wrong, shit still important hell. good - let's see employer, one exists, say well Shocking news 🤦🏼‍♀️ Washington team won’t need make changes all! $10 tickets last year stadium still well capacity. Obama running president again? Last time checked, Biden. 

Please keep mind Biden Obama's VP? 

In town hall, Obama even made reference fact Biden working problem together. Sure, let's get guns hands criminals, like repetitive drunk drivers allowed drive anymore.

Seat belts speed limits save lives. I'm old enough remember seat belts became law, speed limits lowered. Wow ""it's body, choice"" uprising, like Corona Virus no-mask idiots today get started airbags, put kids back seat belong. 

Responsible gun laws same, getting guns hands criminals, oh no, America can't that. 

The Democrats intention taking guns away. Many responsible gun owners. Awful Critical thinking would encourage people question system, course system encourage it. understand. stating cash impersonal gifter receiver.

Cutting boards nice tho... used league test subjects vaccine trials. Yeah see it. Part hyper masculine bullshit “I’m free individual nobody gonna make wear mask.” friend mine nurse medium health care center New Jersey, Catholic profit. lost sense taste smell height pandemic April. refused test her. take PTO. delivered probably 40 babies. wonder many deaths resulted this. NJ testing limited symptoms. Great news baseball! Pretty sure strain already dominant USA. actual report kind wild. 51 percent men believe Bill Gates creating tracking device injected caronavirus vaccine. make president day I'm sure. could. 

We won’t


But could. Shifting standard like it’s okay use scarf kn95 instead n95 specific quality assurance criteria shortage takes blame liabilities employers don’t provide them. get sick pass away employer say time standard. see spoiled brats making millions. see owners spoiled billionaires. I’d say cancel. think survive case makes perfect sense though. still funding run big trials. basically doctors going clinic every day writing paper analyzing data evening. Without grad students, etc. protesting, genuine question Golfing saved untold lives. telling would happened spent time giving deadly self defeating commands. Fair enough. one silent second amendment crowds. face disdain ""Man"" tyranny evil government. Crickets tyrannical government shows test face. Predict large die shortly cos-play convention sturgis.

Yeah every doctor engineer gets 300k base suppose.  thought meant ""just say no"" part - ignore problem aspect. Victimless crime, like punching someone dark. [""You've got help us, one really knows.

the problem US pre-COVID house cards. past single parent could work decent job provide family (it candy canes rainbows back hear out)

people era tell us could pay college summer job maybe side gig spending money semester

now every member house works cases even children soon able go work support family. mom worked 2 3 jobs almost entire life.

safety nets eroded eliminated, college getting expensive least seemed reach joined Army GI BILL, k-12 seems like falling behind I've arena while.

Childcare expensive school often double duty day care

it seems house cards might get blown airborne virus. somewhat poetic. untill next month... Almost four 9/11's every single week. assume cancel season players opt pay checks?   know. people die causes get timely help

those people died COVID19. coronavirus need infect kill you.

whatever term want use describe deaths caused COVID19, numbers include people would otherwise alive pandemic. matter tested positive not. K? fyi strain always particular virus, otherwise different virus. several coronaviruses true, different viruses altogether strands. strand means usually small difference like molecule change different virus family like sars sars-covid2, completely different structures similar heritage / evolution origin  discreet it, rarely would anything happen Delco definitely has, MontCo's last 7 days 20% less cases previous 7 days. EU unified could counter Chinese imperialism. next century gunna suck hope they're collecting objective data publishing get politicized. Finland tried program like much overall population. Surely people already voting Biden (which seems large majority *fingers toes crossed*) would swayed attempt take credit vaccine idiot sons tweeting nonsense Covid, masks, scientists, doctors, etc. months. supporters might try give credit, fuck them. It’s clear stands anyone functioning brain. fair, entirely athletes whether want education. football players go something clearly meant easy pass like media studies communications, plenty take advantage scholarship major engineering, history, arts, business, etc. paint one brush. Trump GOP traitors. Actual, literal traitors country. makes supporters traitors extension, concerned ""disenfranchising"" them.

If choice letting traitors vote, letting vote 100k people die result votes (you know: what's happening right fucking now), would clearly choose latter, makes wonder good person actually are.  right way. hopefully germany soon Luckily bad yet. healthcare workers. believe so! part first wave UK. 2005 think. 0/10 would recommend You’re full shit really pisses plenty people directly impacted Republicans' inaction continue blaming Democrats somehow keep voting people them. necessarily infected it. Many also experienced hair loss stress lockdown, etc. don't. dont make 300k (base)/year doctors know they’re doing. president attacking doctors midst pandemic. fuck. get wrong gym owners (and goers pictures) black POC, would still breaking law undermining public health initiatives pandemic. support BLM single protest can't certain causing harm. still struggle ongoing choice. deeply feel people feel like choice, centuries long oppression terrorism forced abandon shelter place take physical stance state sanctioned violence murder. 

To co-opt sentiment language want gym open? That's extra gross. could never teacher. barely handle kids yet alone bunch peoples. lol. applaud decision- Good choice!! Yeah ficking mother, high risk ""someone car crash tested positive covid counted numbers overblown"" 

Then high number infections 
""Oh hospitals get money report overblown"" 

So number cases deaths massively overblown experts lying ? 

""Sounds right me"" 

Fuuuuuuuck Joe Biden vote for?  Wow. That's messed up. told dumbasses didn’t need wear masks even set example himself. circles back him. I’m sure anyone ecstatic Biden. Look mister fancy wanting bathtub. leaky, low pressure shower head good enough you? reminds talking coworkers much make. not? you’d see badly you’re getting screwed create working class solidarity. GoFundMe $255K 3 days! That's awesome. one aspect like state (NRW, Germany). try hire new teachers instead firing them. still shortage least keep funding. spelled trump Trump reason we're fucked.

Trump symptom, cause. Dumbasses reason Trump. 

Do think getting rid November means we're done stupidity country? so, bad news... health minister stopped counting 28k. Huh, that's still quite lot. way Canadians reddit talking thousand Americans (a tiny fraction total) trying get in, I'd thought would unanimous. CT NJ got infected NY travelers coming state catching NY trying escape carrier/having someone sick them.

They came Fairfield county spread hitting schools/hospitals first family met sick members coming state brought work.

Our saving grace City nearly big NY hospitals every single city along Coast along one every single major town. still beds/supplies we've getting sick.

Our biggest worry we're still getting State travel Vacation goers took less week jump Hospitals schools. Reopening either going kill lot kids lot Adults both. god, did'nt read word wrote you? weigh risks. Without knowing results phase 3 trials starting, possible talk specifics. would currently rather take risk vaccine short track record safety versus virus short track record killing causing chronic problems. ""they"" trying pump death numbers?

1. Why?

2. think test nursing homes people mortality risk others maybe trying prevent premature death?

3. percentage deaths ""car accident"" ones opinion?

4. excess annual deaths compared last 5 years data explained counted COVID deaths? Seems like nonsequetir, but: **YES** prevailing idea seems kids either die kidnapped watching times

America huge problem human trafficking kidnapping, there's that. town used live in, fact, always reports grubby dudes beat old cars trying snatch kids (part reason live anymore).  actually think Trump aberration, mistake, fucking obvious consequence 60+ years neoliberal political hegemony. think somehow dems make everything better, despite fact they've major components US failing state. Dems pushed disastrous US foreign policy (Veitnam War, Iraq War, continuation Afghanistan War, NAFTA, name few), pushed gutting social welfare net starting Carter, ramping Clinton thoroughly destroyed it. Dems hell bent destroying public education (dems pushing anti-union charter schools hard reps). Dems love privatization austerity. easy would dems win fall pushed anti-austerity measures house forced reps block senate. dems could push COVID-19 UBI bill extends unemployment insurance house, won't. that, think?
For fucks sake, Obama refused fucking fix Flint's water.

The fact can't realize dude pushed Iraq War 100% vile, disgusting, evil Donald Trump telling moral character. Football training SJW shit, saving lives. agree education sacrificed unless absolutely necessary, infective is, there's way safely reopen schools, let alone country. Words tough huh buddy reminder many lab processing centers closed weekend, less test results reported Monday. Tuesday Saturday typically higher numbers. That’s 1 person dead every 59 seconds Hi Karen,

only idiots march death others tbh. nazis example. live Nuremberg so, know I‘m talking about. Ok, people nazis disguise though. would heartbeat. Probably it’s time take present shitty move future. Adapt, change etc. university system sustainable anyways... issues started way covid, immagine many loans gonna delayed never paid back? financial institutions rich afford loss? (Are investors happy?) It’s chain reaction take years really experience damage fullness... year half supermajority right? gained nothing. course didn’t know conversation going go started it. think you’re living fantasy world. think I’m slave-prisoner overlord. Nothing going come realized stopped it. I’m quite happy. too, it! Drive ins. pop drive setup area it’s way people going see movies outside homes. Everyone outside US calls riots, ones calling protestors Americans. cannot disembarked along coast ship, act ferry like ships fleet, hence misleading claim (at least regarding title).

Edit: Either way bad situation ship owner trying hide contagion media used local (unknowingly) taxi drivers instead ambulances offered hospital fact strong suspicion COVID-19 among sick crew. ""up to"", huh? confident scary thing say understanding already delays tests Florida storm. Even days 50% testing throughput would devastating. Let's cut testing half. Duh. 5000 people week die coronavirus.
This obviously US beautiful amazing tests.
We test anyone whole galaxy!!!
Now watch sweet, sweet healthcare system takes great care sick people.
I can't wait pay fortune lose home medical services may receive. Better die right? That’s logic use arguing return school say that? must skimmed it. Ten percent Americans average \~74 drinks week. insane. 

 2001, 2002, 2003..... 3,000.... 4,000. say ban. tax hell. cities listed surrounded suburbs actually affordable, trade commute.

But Bay Area. Notice Oakland listed here. Oakland!?! I'm old enough remember basically west coast Baltimore. nice place. restrictions building new housing imperiled entire Bay Area. Yes, video games become TVs generations, phones.., virus kill? hundreds thousands deaths covid related? Really? dropped 18% until.. yesterday. go suddenly, cost lot poor people lives, make rich people even richer, start going back again. Titilating “news” travel blazingly fast Facebook circles people told trust experts. dear leader says basically trust he’s moron pushes conspiracy. Remember birtherism? urging wear mask, none football trainings Maybe sub covid sure does. Remindme! 11/3/2020 regions zero cases dinner restaurant mandated reduced capacity risky risky might initially appear. lot kids get parents medicine cabinet start experiment ng drugs, stealing sharing kids. really went ritalin xanax amd would sell high school.

I would say 90s 2000s half friends this. Quite still taking opioids day... 1-2 days still good enough, people idiots still go out. Even symptoms know exposed.  lose parents week, please dont post picture me, alone smiling. moms like say get haft million houses bet set die sounds pretty damn shit me.. Rather mom dad long houses. That's second time happened Indiana.  assume we're going trifecta? Democrats Republicans come together easily renew Patriot Act continue unconstitutional spying Americans, refuse work together help citizens worst crisis since World War 2. love country!!! teaching license suspended year, probably take least long it’s safe anyways, much less worse able ever teach you’re dead. knowing contributed deaths others, may include children families, well friends/family.

It’s really brainer, despite argument anyone might make, return school year Yeah, sure hell loves mix two high energy breeds!! lol. I've lost 14 lbs since whole thing started guess there's positive well. Sure many can't say According capitalist industrialist personally know, reopened soon. !remindme 11/3/2020 Yeah us gonna gonna everything power keep virus going unless administration replaced. vaccine unlikely free already happened NYC. dieing refrigeratored truck full. live across hospital saw bodies count wheeled them. Connotation vs Denotation 

You know damn well word ""missile"" convey dictionary definition vernacular use. Excusing China hardly doing. I’m way saying US response fault anybody else, I’m exclusively talking China fabricating covid data didn’t admit cases pneumonia could new disease besides tons data available showed it. offed several doctors blew whistle this. don’t second say took seriously start, didn’t. videos footage China absolutely shocking, straight abducting people suspected infected putting makeshift hospitals. 

Yes China initiated probably strictest lockdown world seen, no, doesn’t validate number 80k. Wuhan city 15M people, virus already spread provinces well, there’s absolutely zero possibility numbers low reported many healthcare experts argue 20-30 times higher reported. good handle now? Absolutely. mean didn’t lie knew start? Fuck doesn’t. say right thing contain end, early response abysmal period. know. let FEMA barricade in. Yes. Registered applied mail ballot! wondering same. Florida relying quick test turnarounds contact tracing (which know are), kinds storms could cause serious issues. least states, spread become widespread contact tracing becoming irrelevant. one weird doctor Covid hates! Dirty... I'm gonna guess dirty far less inhabited. r shelters soooo.... Let know “Liberal Controlled States” coordinate foreign countries (I.e. early warning systems), develop nation-wide pandemic plan, control interstate commerce. Last checked Federal Government responsibilities mostly dismantled Trump administration. Testing sights among things closed since thursday. Currently 3,800 people died covid Georgia. 
20,000 people die every year Georgia heart disease.  
What's wrong picture? I’m Florida - mind blowing happening here. think Swedish example shows achieve lot relatively mild voluntary measures cooperative public make possible people financially stay home sick laid off. suggested immediate reduction infection measures implemented. 

But think already widespread burden infection, you’re going bend curve slowly full lockdown, suggesting might effective strategy levels infection already high. you’re looking second wave, rising number still small aggregate, might effectively halt development Sweden-style intervention instead full lockdowns. Yeah we’re kind now... we’re already 1,000 deaths/day fuck we’re getting started. going get really bad. Hopefully change leadership real soon even US clearly already lost control this.

I wish they'd focus frustration current administration cares bailing big businesses rather helping individual Americans financial difficulties. Dr. President Trump doesn’t care mostly tolerate milk (and love it). people around can't tolerate aftermath!  Canadian government takes blame initially lied masks, saying dangerous use them. Im sure helped ensure public health crisis.

I'd personally (using nursing judgment, opinion) trust smoking vaping.

No, prefer equitable system. backwards. ability normalize horrible conditions continue function one reasons we've successful species. *Weak* people, care others.

Target goers mostly wear masks, Walmart? Lol, sike. I’ve going Asian &amp; Mexican markets, since they’re close.

They’ll find something else focus though. doesn’t make hard find headline report since can’t resist urge fuck every opportunity. entirely unreasonable want work provide kids, dismiss silly selfish. think condone poor financial behavior simply people living outside means according statistics.

Don't misunderstand me. individuals lack financial discipline. government along corporations can't control themselves, absurd individuals expect government bail out.

 Same. nothing could done it. Yeah many unknowns sure. starting wander territory someone forces vaccine early, could impact November (you'd hope so). I'm surprised seen Trump start tweeting Astra Zeneca CEO needs release vaccines produced far. know tweet would effective manner, I'm still surprised seen it. learning live it, said, big additional costs society.

Yup. Seems normal parents choosing do. It’s tough spot. want everyone physically safe, mental health important too. mention social skills jazz. parents picking choosing enforce distancing. You’ve probably enough conversations determine indoor friends, outdoor friends, no, don’t see families. It’s hard leap go indoor friends banding together schooling. way family also gets uninterrupted weeks working lowers cost per family. Fwiw, information outside probably safer inside since George murdered May 22 shortly killed 25th.

So know going turn out, reason think might okay you, protests part near universal mask compliance.

I realized potentially dangerous masked maintained quarantine otherwise.

The protesters know treated way.

So, agree know hand, reason suspect think mostly protested responsible way.

At minimum, 25,000 people leave sick visiting places along way home.
