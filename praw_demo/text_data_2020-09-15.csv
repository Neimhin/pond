0,2020-09-15,"  Keep praying guys wrong, flu kill hundreds thousands problem right strain comes along. 675,000 died US 1918 50 million died worldwide far far worse. Keep mind population way less back too. Making morality rare much higher even death number deaths occur. Thug ass Batista supporters.. guy bad news.. brutal LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ü•Çüçæü•≥
HERES 200,000 like caravan 2018. Projection way down. prime example everyone calls us Wississipi, North Alabama, Florida Midwest.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   Sweden heavily fortifies foods Vitamin D, people Africa obviously exposed sunlight. circumstantial evidence pointing towards efficacy. NUMBER ONE NUMBER ONE USA USA USA Second part author trying fill required word count. man..... means we're talking a..... g......gh....ghost! vote christ sakes. Protest, unionize organize organized left US going continue way. ....illegally. restricted government.  would prefer freedom. Ya mostly people going die something relatively soon anyway  USA economy second China Corona virus?‚Äî say yes. Bro we're winning race. Big W bossman. We're really showing world fucking retarded are. seeing massive fraud put people behind bars quick buck? :/

As pointed out, amounts low would leave gap explaining many excessive deaths year. forget Trump calls ""China virus"". Strange. second half says virus likely came bats southern China contradicts claim man-made. travelled sick person wet market. wet market close main train station. remember 15 almost 0 prediction  two 9/11s per week  USA NUMBER 1 BABYYYYYY!!!!! Remember president United States said would go away like magic we'd soon zero cases?

Conservatism dissociative disorder lose grip reality took words mouth. Anyone trusts MSM trusting bunch liars least sensationalists spinning actual news fit political bias. pneumonia. Look total deaths without cause  Looking overlays cases deaths staggering deaths longer follow case curve, even remotely close. 

Deaths metric. evidence even recover may suffer longer term health effects. goes stop NOBODY KNOWS! 

Seriously though fuck. 107 days left end year. 
Even 1k deaths/day, we'll around 300,000 end year. sure voted agree ! really get - talking like US still strict lockdown, really look like case long time. respect cost-benefit analysis, government worried huge extent, probably much, economic damage, see almost everything already reopened. biggest restrictions still around wear masks inside possibly limits mass gatherings, seem pretty reasonable given fact there's high levels community spread going on. would want reopen still been? sure downvoted you‚Äôre 100% correct. US constitution limits federal government, state government... Sad say that‚Äôs it‚Äôs September we‚Äôre number. Vote. Please, love whatever want love you, vote. New Years Resolution: DONT DIE What's recommended medication murder symptoms? know. hate seeing rest world thinking we're bunch morons. us, swear. that's fault virus, fault human reaction virus. makes point even ridiculous. Republicans, human deaths nothing number. Also, flu deaths counted via mortality. Covid must test. Yeah think major factor. Similar areas Brazil. Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan Thailand Malaysia went hard restrictions quarantines they've gone song dance before. Australian federal government better part two months advised soft touch, seen incremental restrictions foreign access. Recommendations public level maintain distancing wear masks flat ignored became enforceable policy (that facebook fuckwits still protest day). Victorians less culpable mess we've put in. excludes died home don‚Äôt get tested, actually upper bound. probably look excess deaths since sides argue recorded Covid deaths either high low. Excess deaths don‚Äôt lie. attempt minimize significance COVID-19 impact population, always find interesting war death tolls (from decades ago) used relevant points comparison. 

Why show comparisons current diseases illnesses? 

The flu estimated claimed roughly 35k lives U.S. past flu season 2019, cancer estimated caused 600k deaths U.S. disease causes 650k deaths per year U.S. AMERICA #1 really flu exercise would last thing mind. You‚Äôve cold. cross state line. hoax conspiracy sure lot collaboraters... Liven't It'll get colder  **""... hate fact think way ...""**

Tears came eyes read comment especially line.  

This changed everyone better us.

WOOHOO!! NEW RECORD HELL YEAH. SUCK EU AMERICA EVERYTHING BIGGER BETTER 0.6% Americans, 200,000 people died 200,000 families lost someone. percentage. Google appears working odd use quotation marks actually quoting. Nobody actually goods promises release later. release Someone wanted get rid free award thought it'd funny put looking average death age left behind contributing problem. me, 42 year old healthy colleague died leaving behind husband three young children. That‚Äôs picture ‚Äúpainted‚Äù moment pandemic became real spreadsheet. seems bad form hide medical advice behind paywall. Gosh, thank you. Promise fishing compliment, makes feel less insane.

Having moved Oklahoma Washington state 7 yes ago moments wish lived closer. found growing there, however, culture ones surroundings real impact person's sense safety health (mental physical.) understand money necessary tool, bottom line somehow becomes top priority health community baffles me. 

Especially year.
This year extra trying watching folks back home deal pandemic half measures all. mother nurse repeatedly asked fly visit newborn. repeatedly joylessly say take risk. feel her. second year make home holidays I'm bummed - want anyone get sick. Even believe Covid threat.

Sorry ramble on, thought recently mother saying ""this world messed up."" lived America. Seems unfair make blanket statement. Winning! told could beat staying home, people stayed home, didnt happen

**Did** stay home? 

There enough countries demonstrated staying home possible, wear mask social distance go out, get covid control. Canada, China, New Zealand, Korea, Vietnam, Germany, etc.. 

The reason beat covid Americans stay home. bodies fittest people earth respond excercise recovery, compared average person, hugely different. 

Fit people way way less likely get sick, symptoms bad, recovery better, time recover better. athletes eat well balanced diets train daily years day job. built stay strong. every protective factor illness risk factors. 

Compare overweight person cardiovascular strength, never physically pushes body, body never goes periods strenuous activity recovery, dont eat well.... people easily get unlucky, get flu one year, suffer permanent damage..

Now imagine person gets covid, body working overtime fight used sitting couch watching Netflix. feel better one day immediately decide time get fit bust ass exercising... body isnt good recovering need time. system weak cant take stress. excercise could put ass. 9th worst world (San Marino Andorra count) terms deaths per 1 million live that's notice area.. maybe different you. Yeah people idea things work feel entitled demand magic change to. wear shorts walk outside underwear. asshole even wear mask *MID JULY*  ""We Champions Worlddddd..."" - Donald Trump

/s judge ruling appointed 2019. Depends many BLM riots are. Every one creates Trump voters.  Right may case Covid taken vulnerable would died flu winter flu deaths may bad compared years. I'd guess closer 400k myself. hope I'm right. üôÑ sarcasm dude. hell 22-year old get nearly $2m loans hair salon? terrible remember predictions called one million without protective measures? seems much better though..I think hospitalizations overwhelmed anywhere can't mourn nation around half filled braindead morons incapable empathy. Similar story - Aunt recently passed away. stage 4 lung cancer doctors gave months live. got COVID towards end months, according parents, put COVID cause death death certificate. uncle one read death certificate. 

I personally see certificate myself. I've seen rolling process people. I'm close someone took seriously beginning but, think, honest time table nihilistic, going hockey practice. He's turned health nut past 6 months using justify decisions, I've heard similar things others.

Radical acceptance something learned therapy, skill something comes naturally people, think. Np. away Easter Vienna sausages here. one weirdo. know Cast system also problem time, especially pandemic. really think bottom ones get treatment, spreading rich too. Also, heard hospitals incentives show recovered cases, discharge someone die later unrelated cause death certificate. 

For country big, many poor many people living side official numbers population, simply trust data low mortality India, sorry.  Yes, countries expect handle pandemic well. India Brazil surprising. anti-mask anti-shutdown idiots countries including Canada. However, expect governments wealthy countries protect citizens. world saw US explode cases surprised expected government something keep numbers lower.

They expected US full idiots. expect government fail protect them. Start charging science deniers manslaughter. 

Science denial disease bad Covid *that* caused untold devastation America. 

Every science denying citizen cancer country. wonder happens vaccines partial efficacy. places like new zealand outbreaks things open up. Lmao predictable society collapses yes milk sour. say called it. continue live life like worst case scenario come true 100% time. 

It makes difference right wrong. base input likelihood something occurring, right idea society collapsing going collapse pandemic even going year wild me. pandemic several companies throughout several countries promising trials potential vaccinations. time goes on, trials end inconsistent negative data none get approved. worry comes next, still think society collapse, restructure cope deal world covid always present. latest trustable figures IMO 0.5 1%. still lot unknowns undocumented a/paucisymptomatic individuals high amount excess deaths year. Also, improvements treatments severe cases knocked number dramatically since March. You‚Äôve convinced me. See 2022 everyone! soon, world's deaths get **a million** ... know feel anymore, crazy winter coming. honestly thought America going war Iran January. Yeah. original version said employee attended wedding. But, article since updated. relative says nurse goes church ""forced claim people died covid get money hospital."" relative gone pretty far deep end last 15 years, absolutely believe nurse told crap. I've many conversations anti-vax, science-denying medical professionals think really unlikely among would lie support worldview. worry, go away gets warmer 2021 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll disappear Easter‚Äù flu usually kill 200k 9 months? forget /s gone already lol USA USA USA!!!

So much winning. Sorry loss. Crickets... Uneducated idiots support guy cause saw tv think he‚Äôs racist browns.   ""his"" voting base care, independents want 2009 2017. problem midset 8 years hell sight better now. want either ""Oh man, digging graves sooo cool, guess I'll stop wearing masks :/""   risk life life Mexico largely dogshit compared remotely successful country. expected decent quality roads least, got concrete roads bad road design. think we'd better made less likely would even need group maintain order. military police may bit oversimplification exist people lots find necessary attack hurt others, believe driving force behind large percentage incidents due issues surviving getting one form another. think people generally want hurt attack anyone, granted exceptions exist always will. much crime back 50's compared now? Back possible someone working regular basic job perhaps cooking food something similar home, car pay whatever bills came them. absolutely necessary someone charge job required special training education. Additionally class people held financial ruling majority least level seeing right now. also look lot European countries gotten along lot better US that's based traveling there. stuck see near many gigantic houses specifically houses exponentially larger average home there. See, dumb use anecdotal evidence.

It bad you, good you. someone else, worse flu. another, flu.

That's look larger picture, would dumb draw conclusion something based limited data. larger picture shows worse flu. personal experience simply change larger picture tells us COVID vs flu. diabetes. hike woods bear attacks you. ER doctors trouble stabilizing complications diabetes die. bear kill diabetes kill you? terminal degree in-demand field? lots money? real sad part power sacrificing future stock market. Glad you‚Äôre recovering well. Please stay safe healthy doubt people care go hospitals. can't imagine a. multi night covid19 stay would cost. seems comment parroted every time there's statement - remember talking enough vaccines entire world here. Places like US, EU, China, Australia probably going vaccinated enough return normal mid-2021 they've already ordered requisite amount doses.  That‚Äôs really true. Spanish flu lethal acted quickly. plenty documented cases medical professionals died within hours showing first symptoms. Even though treatments improved (though think you‚Äôd surprised little we‚Äôve improved regards treating viral infections pneumonia sometimes cause), it‚Äôs impossible effectively administer treatment people die quickly. still want Blue Pepsi back :( I‚Äôm depressed it.

Yup 2020 still hot disaster Yes, even accounted COVID deaths caused pneumonia, standalone pneumonia deaths still huge excess.

""It's nothing, 100 deaths tops""

""It's nothing, 1000 deaths tops""

etc etc

""It's nothing, 1 million deaths tops""

*Final death count, 500k*

""See? tell you?""

they'll actually come thinking right along. New york jersey responsible almost 50k deaths 200k. 25% deaths. 

How governors raked coals? 

There mishandling virus needs talked instead pushing blame fed. stayed open longer needed said virus bad early on. Mine turned newt!! Fattening curve  Brutal. Close million dead summer. problem virus isn‚Äôt bad enough. killed 10-40% people got made bleed ass die made go blind give horrible skin lesions. honestly it‚Äôs pretty mild people death rate low. one takes seriously doesn‚Äôt really affect much. Plus deaths really old folks. Yes others nearly many. It‚Äôs hard really scared me. Show zombies. I‚Äôll scared. Karens Chads expect? mean there's reason people risk lives get illegally. I‚Äôm bragging Canada 9,188 deaths, one good friends 27 yr old perfectly healthy nieceüòî. death d/t Covid tragic death caused lack caring social distance wearing mask heartbreaking, tragic reprehensible! long waiting crack gem? gave $50 per month muh paycheck! No, CDC estimates IFR 0.65 %. remember everything flipping shit Italy got 10,000 deaths. control, people responsible continue feign ignorance guys! want thank everyone little make special moment happen! could achieved without gullibility apathy! Really great job guys. true, would much worse Covid actual darkest timeline would probably never come back from. Wtf wrong people?   Weren‚Äôt hospitals getting paid covid deaths person died unrelated reasons, Covid. labeled Covid ? flu mild disease. People often misuse ‚Äòflu‚Äô mean general bug, including stomach ailments. You‚Äôre right isn‚Äôt akin common usage ‚Äòflu‚Äô, much severe. 

However, influenza minor illness. Several pandemics 50s 60s similar death rates Covid, Spanish flu 1918 much higher. quite comparable bad pandemic flu years ain‚Äôt said diminish severity. Rather, said ground Covid reality show isn‚Äôt alien super virus, one similar 50 year pandemic flu. flus also side effects death, bad viral infections. Maybe shit ton capital change entire service model possible. restaurants instead close forever. remember someone comments like ""this going disappear April. watch."" Biiiiitch bet fucking embarrassed now. Yep. back bragging 60 victory. Well wrong again, surprise me. 

I'd surprised pandemic lasted 6 months stopped... 

The global daily records still set. 300k new cases one day last week. hope right think so.  Even death rate, approaching 9% spanish flu, happened knew viruses were. think rural areas see numbers go up. Way next month-ish. know rural school Kingsley article case Day 4 majority kids opting online learning. Well he's saying tremendously big leadership, he's saved millions. üôÑ

Meanwhile, south Korea like...5 people less die months. like candy trail walkway? Space put candy advance little ones. :( difficult trust process executive branch falsified politicized health crisis. facts. lot stupid baked headline. 50k, 100k, 150k, nothing change keep dying. NEED new leadership NOW.  Longer necessary, something like, next April? certain tangerine-lookin feller real number likely 250ish, then? Yes please Nothing enforced here. Ppe's fake. Everything see pr done government Actually restarting numerical epidemiological reasons *the* important Phase 3 precondition such. US trial sites critical scenario incredibly quick effective vaccine. makes sense situation information withheld regulators trials. 

Reading lines, USA regulators buying coincidence explanation transverse myelitis AZ vaccine group due rarity condition. 

If strong proof caused vaccine (e.g. timeline), shared? Bro gave post wholesome award?? Oh no, not, paints clearer picture mortality risk. 

If people dying healthcare fear deportation, can't afford hospital bills, still huge failure. Part Chinese people flying Europe New York order circumvent travel ban. estimate 2020 600k back March. I'm getting unsettling impression I'm going far off. official number either way Right. wish would say ""1 person died last 24 hours"" . Telling us number reported, saying ""the last 24 hours"" disingenuous know _exactly_ sounds. Gotta keep us scared!! Cause death: ~~COVID~~ Heart Stopped Beating  link leads Reuters, trusted source information. title objectively true statement, based verifiable, trusted information. Please elaborate reasoning removing post. sister people seeing 7 days? Post wedding family visits common already 'traveled far'. dont like thorns turds, put daisies. I‚Äôm US - even cancer diagnosis, getting care hard. partner ER visit end February imaging showed probable tumor. time (we 45 min outside NYC) locked yet, writing wall. got right doctor follow tests 3 days lockdown told certainly cancer, need biopsy confirm get info. biopsy didn‚Äôt happen another 3 weeks hospitals overwhelmed. Pathology results took nearly month shutdowns overwhelm. Every test, treatment surgery taken Herculean efforts make happen. 

And diagnosed shutdown - existing patient doctor treating didn‚Äôt find right doc follow make appointment new patient - weren‚Äôt worried second opinion doc whose practice already complete trust GP checking via telemedicine help us figure ask weigh partner‚Äôs care. different, bet would even harder time. lockdown happened diagnosis, may toughed instead going ER. excellent prognosis delays aren‚Äôt going kill - lucky hell that. worried am, heart throat people whose lives risk treatment delayed. before-times, partner would already resection chemo, still waiting ... it‚Äôs breaking head, least it‚Äôs killing him.

Not mention caregivers spread thin. friend nurse well-known hospital cancer center. caring cancer patients also loaned Covid ward help needed. temporarily moved house, afraid would give family. hurts soul people downplay seriousness pandemic - I‚Äôm glad don‚Äôt experience things partner, friend many others wouldn‚Äôt wish enemy, people suffering sometimes dying pandemic, even don‚Äôt get virus. investigation concluded premise wrong, nursing home directive didn‚Äôt cause deaths claim

So nothing take responsibility for. New York bad % nursing home deaths one lowest 

Joke mate, didn‚Äôt even read article Maybe time move? anyone graze balls hand squats? I‚Äôm sure lot people don‚Äôt know they‚Äôve asymptotic mild case. needs long term plan lasting Covid healthcare needs country feeling doubtful there‚Äôs anything long-term planned don‚Äôt concrete short term plan country tackle virus uniformly. India cities dwarf Chinese cities future. time Trump already briefed deadly disease is. relay information governors help decision making since Trump decided take leadership himself? ""I alone fix it."" Yes Zika. Bushes striking back. Keep dying Free world. Basically vaccine thing save us make us return sense normalcy. Due amount stupid people following rules spreading virus, incompetent governments. add complexity, unified commitment stay apart. That's probably NYC's first wave killed large portion elderly population . Yeah... pretty sure lie had, would reporting first place. likely another data transfer hiccup. Depends define ""waste"". accomplish anything? Usually no, discussing things sharing laugh/cry/smile value extremely cold winter.

wait Yup.. happen. Neither state came close multiple weeks daily deaths 600 Funny thing many, many people said knew Donald Trump well advance political aspirations. people choose remain dark even evidence right front them. Insinuating died didn‚Äôt healthcare isn‚Äôt exactly improvement situation.  look reliable me. filed ""journal article"" publication info listed. 

Here's random article looks like published: conduct expensive research upload papers onto sharing sites. Big red flag. Thank you! sorry, pledge continue wearing mask throughout coming years, without Cure. Since problem Cuomo taking responsibility. feel president taking responsibility? VA‚Äôs stats always weird think people completely desensitized point. Others really believe handled well. Hence maybe, also doctor's test could either. Considering still want get covid, I'm gonna optimistic quite over... still denial actions. 

Also lack acknowledgement disrespectful dead. really mind tbh. concerning they'd acting different. right, existence democracy enough. [India ""flawed getting less democratic every year.

You also need money implement needed, India much democracies. hold MS certainly 20s, best discredit know much could conceive anecdotes conspiracies. even assigning gender. Fascinating. Yeah, understandable stage things like let American citizens without requiring quarantine anything, people really realize extent things. still fully shut flights. honestly think lot buffets won‚Äôt reopen. They‚Äôre business model that‚Äôs dying unsanitary reputation drive away lot customers. Flu infections also associated massive spike heart attack risk weeks. I'm getting ready hunker next six months üò´  Plus... 6-9 months (depending start counting). 

So... ""mere"" 3x worse flu (if count long term side affects normally ""just flu"".

Sigh... think depends lot location. I'm harsh winters common, people trying go January anyway. doubt there'll huge push end restrictions spring. weather gets nice again, bets off. Every single thread sub least one garbage comments. worthless existence. Quote article:

Bill Cosby‚Äôs Dates dont remember Set bar lower Going post history understand lot things. social business restrictions, still Covid present (after previously declaring Covid-free) thus still risk deaths, worse drop GDP than, say, us morons UK locked late yet drop GDP greater 2008 crash. ""perfect"" strategy successful?

Edit: let's forget, incredible restrictions international travel, clear way lift them. Italian ask tell colleague please find way hell forget way back?
Much obligated, 
A. comment initially responding saying hybrid going hunker winter spring comes done following guidelines absolutely inappropriate unsafe. 

I‚Äôm following guidelines given we‚Äôre good. That‚Äôs literally ask. known fact immunology comment...Canada roughly twice population Netherlands, yet run 3 times many tests. Granted, testing population types tests etc make difference. However, positive cases rising much slower Canada compared Netherlands (more 3x per capita compared Canada), Canada relatively strict mask rules. 

I‚Äôm getting data worldmeters.info  There's lot concern politics influencing CDC decisions. [HHS spokesman accused CDC crazy rant scientists Trump. He's taking medical leave. Perhaps CDC politicians met middle ground announce optimistic/possible ending. got completely wrong. followed January, clear super early could spread asymptomatic carriers. knew that, knew that, government knew lied keep inventory available healthcare system. 
I actually support lying keep healthcare system protected cause people would 100% hoarded masks didn‚Äôt. 
But really think didn‚Äôt knew didn‚Äôt lie, clearly weren‚Äôt following international news. US early January. report coming Asia Europa way that. Lol, percent tests positive. Everyone say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs sad‚Äù nothing happen. muh freedom! ""I'm appealing stupid idiots vote Democrat 2020. basic education enough read ballot, anyway. understand majority racist rednecks can't even read post, though. can, please pass message rest inbred family.

We Democrats morally, culturally intellectually superior every way. qualify noting Liberal Arts degree college, obviously never to, even know one is. also black friend. told several professors everything hold dear terrible. Therefore you, personally, also terrible.

I know you, know racist. also know hate gay people still get scared lightning storms.

The religion hold closely, greatly believe in, brings comfort--you wrong I'm smarter I'm telling so. one many reasons stupid I'm better you.

You see, us Democrats want system helps everyone world. system designed around love kindness everyone. agree, hate you.

It's late change. knew history, course don't, remember time America Indians dragged away homes forced assimilate white society. Well, want change kind behaviour (sorry spelling, I'm country) making sure go college small apartment big, busy coastal city, belong. help rid backward, incorrect culture way thinking. We'll everything make sure agree us say right things brainwashed thinking way do.

All stupid, backward, redneck, racist, homophobic, uneducated yokels need realize we're trying build classless society get live harmony other, we're equal. understood much worse person am.

So please vote Democrat. Help help you, worthless motherfuckers""

This people sound. single minded think calling comment extremely smug tone somehow pro-trump comment anti-trump beyond me.


Oh wait, nevermind. post history strongly suggests teenager forgiven. generally expect computing power greater digital watch demographic's brains. entire world shut indefinitely? 40 million people USA could evicted moratorium up. ""temporary"" unemployed permanently unemployed. take account many people underemployed took pay cut start working Wal Mart.

If year, family still go know tell you. need make decision stay home point let everyone else get life.

The entire world can't go indefinite pause. sustainable much want be. unreasonable think instead sabotaging things (trying keep governors locking down, discouraging mass use, stealing state's shipments PPE, closing borders late giant loopholes etc) right thing even nothing, we'd much better situation. US going make 12 months. People done. going sweep through. lock downs precautions hospitals overwhelmed and/or heard immunity. like it, I'm blind see happening. I'm denying leaders made colossal mistake here, come plausible, reasonable explanation poorly understood virus.

If guessing cloth masks small benefit airborne contamination, adjusting mask significant risk (touch virus touch eyes, etc.), might guess professionals trained touch PPE would small net benefit, general public wouldn't, possibly even increase risk.

Now turns out, even cloth masks large benefit, surface transmission virus seems much lower first thought, bad guesses.

P.S. I'm certain *only* reason cloth masks promoted. Politics, concerns people listening PPE hoarding, etc. people even wash hands going bathroom, good luck masks getting normalized. Oh look, wild Qcumber. quaint ""Yes, lied before, telling truth! Believe us!"" give shit doctors profession, suppose. Though number friends work hospitals laid everyone afraid seek medical care days. 

The curve flattened temporarily, sure. far greater cost social health, mental health, economic health; far beyond benefits locking down. Failure comply two steps.

1. business provides services customer without mask there's mandate, immediate $10,000 fine warning second violation result revocation business license.

2. Failure comply second time permanent revocation business license. 

Literally overnight businesses would actually force people doing. 
For individuals 3 step process:

1: written warning appears record future citation purposes 

2: $5,000 fine 1 year probation.
3. 6 months house arrest. 

Too extreme? [3,278 people serving life sentences nonviolent life death situation many people treated such. doea protect others you. wear mask others protected like 70% protected range 50%, data varies study. that's talk broadly catching it. seperate droplets vs aerosol protected range 80% droplets aerosol drops down. new information come viral load aerosol low enough people asymtomatic might give person level protection like vaccine using dead virus.

on phone percents memory i'm armchair scientist formal training. Definitely surprised this. ton local restaurants bars near closed last month two. stuck mostly shitty chain places ughh. liked analogy! Can‚Äôt argue logic fellow earthling :) consider would reported media. two individuals died, chances media wouldn‚Äôt mention bum leg focus number individuals dying, making lava seem odious reading. hey, that‚Äôs me, cares think.

Edit: typo don't. idiots influenced another idiot. believe something concentration virus (viral load??) person triggers immune system. Basically, mask allow less virus system means body better odds overcoming attack. someone verify this? predictable. Spain getting around 10,000 new cases day. expanded testing average age Covid cases falling, death rate developed world settled around 2% (comapred 10% Western European countries before). 10,000 new cases every day eventually mean around 200 deaths. Yet, people still arguing increasing caseload without eventually seeing deaths. weirdo Wait, saying people mad 200,000 deaths caused government neglect, instead mad many people dying future government neglect?  


How enough travesty olympics, let people pissed 200,000 people dead be.  get people lost trust. consider thought experiment alternative. Like toilet paper, everyone starts panic buying N95 respirators find them. People travel far wide search them, potentially exposing others virus. Meanwhile, limited supply available medical workers completely gone. March April, rationing N95s re-using days, previously considered single use disposed of. virus gets foothold, medical workers can't protect themselves. worried hospital capacity overwhelmed April May. protection, medical professionals also would get sick much higher rate, unable come work, exacerbating hospital capacity issue.

So although lied, would caused harm? Loss trust &amp; long term issues mask compliance now, collapse medical system everyone hoarding N95s? wait see, NZ's Covid story over. found case school, clearly indicates community transmission. Lol yep. Great attitude have. 

OR 

Everyone follow guidelines keep everyone safe possible! Yes, giving someone huge loan 0 near 0% interest exactly that: bailout. turn around invest money make profit entirely taxpayer money. Nevermind companies taking PPP loans revenue hundreds millions... much ""Small Business...""


Why private citizens offered huge loan 0% interest? 
What's good goose good gander, bail ass please. Anti-lockdowners: ""Those old people going die year anyway.""

Pro-lockdowners: ""Those businesses going die year anyway."" lives saved greater deaths caused lockdowns, physical harm caused them, mental harm, economic damage I‚Äôll convinced 60% business industry state?  violates OSHA regulations btw. industry, would cause shut work company would fined oblivion providing PPE. Absolutely disgraceful. America 3rd world country. Lol, imagine making idiot claiming sarcasm... Would mind sharing listed potential side effects were, experienced them?

Valid reason, terrible outcome. risk it, try luck wants get back normal. Along Vitamin articles, seems get posted time. social restrictions

Yeah, group sizes 10 Auckland 100 everywhere else. Big announced biggest ever fall GPD

Which countries still festering there

Yes, clearly &lt;5 cases day festering there. basically less handful countries actually better ""perfect policy"" well.

They've minimized COVID cases/deaths, mitigated losses economy allowing citizens enjoy freedoms countries. well? that's well, country fulfills criteria? 

Heck, would even call America's UK's situation NZ's count well. Abysmal unmitigated failures? Yeah many things maybe. much change next millisecond wonder image mask face triggers misplaced feelings ones ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù literally violated. 

Political cartoons often depict mouths covered various flags symbols (depending [political artist.) Protestors often tape mouths shut send message won‚Äôt silenced, etc. 

I think it‚Äôs overly emotional reaction something appears gag really protection. Every BSOD I've seen due shoddy drivers, unstable overclock failing hardware. Can't blame Microsoft that.  We‚Äôre number one. We‚Äôre number one! worried pandemic riots ever else making depressed. Come Texas we‚Äôre enjoying life normal Pelosi: come chinatown ! It‚Äôs good like think made sense mind. youtuber says masks don‚Äôt work don‚Äôt wear got epidemiologist degree?  little prevent spread flu infringes people's lives ability socialize.

Right. Covid flu. course. Things like encouraging basic handwashing social distancing restricting large gatherings uncontroversial measures.

Right - think mask mandate appropriate? 

Don't get wrong, like stay home orders think anyone does. question conditions measure would appropriate risks society large. 

I hope necessary sure. complain, realize nothing going change. theory: liberal state rural population. don‚Äôt places that‚Äôs likely. It‚Äôs New Yorkers lived spread apart other. Yep keep following guidelines. I‚Äôll keep following ones laid wife. 

Saying you‚Äôre done virus you‚Äôre going back normal spring 100% selfish dangerous. called sarcasm.  lighten gawd sake. excuse States rdealing surging cases deaths today?

The US sufficiently large geographically-diverse various regions curves. See top right graph [from shows various daily death rates (per 1M people) US Northeast, South, Midwest, West.

Also, appears virus' seasonality manifests differently depending region's climate. temperate climates (like European countries US Northeast) seem earlier much sharper, shorter curves whereas tropical climates (US South, Mexico, etc.) seem longer flatter curves much later peak. See, e.g., two clusters daily death rate graph various selected countries: (which phenomenal worth watching entirety) talks phenomenon around 19-minute mark. Read original comment. There‚Äôs least 4 them. Here‚Äôs one even created artificial leakage test masks imitate poor and/or cheap masks, still protected wearer drastically better mask all. study published 2011: claiming didn‚Äôt know either incredibly ignorant intentionally lying, think Fauci like ignorant, I‚Äôve got bridge sell Brooklyn. discernible effect? curve flattened hospitals overwhelmed. dont think that's big deal there's clearly reasoning you. dont give shit doctors. Wtf going Florida? 7 day average stopped declining heading **up** Right, sorry clear: ~~24~~ 79 *active* cases, total, right now.

edit: number google gave wildly incorrect. 79 active cases right now.  Don‚Äôt get hopes up, won‚Äôt be. biggest ever fall GDP. 

But that's true many/most countries fully lockdown. tell us anything itself. 

Let posit scenario completely made-up numbers:

If NZ saved lives lost 8% GDP, US killed ton people also lost 8% GDP, would say NZ's lockdown failed?  convince enough Americans ""lockdown"" operation target Hilary Clinton's operated pedo ring DC pizza parlour there's good chance get lockdown pretty much every person world thinks. Me, guy talking to, pretty much everyone thread. point, Gates use reverse psychology tell people **NOT** wear masks interfere implanted microchips. He‚Äôs actually shitposting troll lol idea. see long 4th july spike show actual numbers. ~2-3 weeks agree completely. I've pretty much stopped trying explain people. I've come realize want see reality. want *feel* right. I'm actually, hate guy, way supporter, definitely counter productive fight COVID.

All I'm saying is, easy say hindsight done 3 week nationwide lockdown I'm February, actually look mood time, would never happened. 

Trump got lot shit closing border. Pelosi saying go crowded Chinese New Year demonstrations. people convinced large outbreak happen here, would another SARS/Ebola thing did, bad, like swine flu.

There way vast majority country would gone mandatory nationwide 3 week lockdown something that, time killed many Americans die vending machines. following guidelines. gyms opening limited capacity 2 weeks live going medically allowed state california county. eat indoors also allowed. hang limited amount friends also recommended ok state. wife stay home others deemed safe them.

And soon restrictions lifted (cases continue drop live) continue personally cannot wait whenever go concert  I'm hoping become little less literally blind stop getting upset smears debunked ‚úåÔ∏è Long term plans? Nah... Short term strategies again, that‚Äôs way it.   Show bat virus! agree points. I've read exact phrasing matters lot. quarantining suggested her, hook. ordered, might face consequences.

Like, moral level guilty me. know enough law sure legally guilty, too. selected Sweden's neighboring countries... wow, cherrypicking.

Guess could add others baltic 

Estonia 48

Germany 113

Latvia 19

Lithuania 32

Poland 59

Russia 130

Hell, even Europe comparison: 286 per million hope stupid douchey 18 are. joke I've said beginning. Keeping entire population quarantine *might* sick something *might* asymptomatic absurd never considered beyond initial 3-4 weeks procuring PPE preparing hospitals. LOL got rolling I'm fan big pharma either, let's prevent us giving credit due... Almost infections happen peoples' homes one wears masks anyway. cases world. Football somehow still important mask wearing proper social distancing protocols, much... country priorities still wack.

We never get this.

And think Covid US ranked #1 best handle pandemic. Give break.. Honest question. low positivity rate soon? NY's numbers already margin error regards false positivity false negativity. disagree criticisms think mask situation would different health experts forthcoming importance masks early think wrong.

It's like anti-mask crowd's main argument early recommendations include masks. stuff freedom rights whatnot. Bringing early recommendations bad faith gotcha argument. mean, that's estimated 6 million Texans it, new. believe single thing chinese government puts out, would like know market bridge. happen lovely one San Francisco thats ready sale. guys pay hospitals death ""linked"" covid, you? Easy say now. wife buy class supplies. expected; teachers get shaft. Nothing new here. There's literally 50/50 chance smoke regularly show piss test doctor said me. Dang economy long gone. hope improve education work ingorance sorts people would snitch neighbors parties stuff like far common Nazis me, someone wants left alone make choices, good dude. Also, stay home orders legally sound constitutional defects, nothing worry someone challenges federal court enforcement enjoined. Sure, would still sting bit grandpa died likely came no?

My mother really get take many risks, really able assess risk. I'd still feel bad got me. Yeah argument would valid transmission wasn‚Äôt important part topic. We‚Äôre getting sick eating soggy pizza. it‚Äôs personal matter. It‚Äôs social matter. wanna heroin keel that‚Äôs business. unnecessarily go feel better start potentially endangering others even linear matter exponential selfishness.  Bruh, like fifth time I‚Äôve seen take days worth information try extrapolate trend. usually agree comes misinformation you‚Äôre right that. Would hoarders resellers bought though? Would people become hoarders resellers? worse prioritizing front line healthcare workers? 

We know answers questions, process getting information related answers trivial. feel like Eastern Europe similar culture East Asia many ways ...which comment talking about. Wearing mask sick even not/post covid. talking wearing mask time period. Strangely lot chinese overseas asia believe this. Yes, deaths zero months anyway. obviously unnessecary. mean, it‚Äôs kind true. best defense actually contract virus cases vaccine doesn‚Äôt produce antibodies individual, given stated vaccine less 100% effective certainly truth headline.....but people absolutely both. issue would recommend getting local CVS, Walgreens pharmacy. Minute Clinic CVS offers $40 US. still affordable many people, half country, stand point. always people cannot afford basic healthcare that's really people I'm criticising. people like coworkers insurance me, live area, yet make excuses. large events going cancelled back-to-back? fear that... Bruh time vacation consider long-term? would consider 6 months long-term. time lift restrictions.  Lead Paragraph:

 world's attention riveted upon growing COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers written brief reports supporting hypothesis vitamin deficiency related incidence severity COVID-19. clear common thread among top risk groups‚Äîvitamin deficiency‚Äîmay overlooked previous overstated claims vitamin benefits. However, need decrease COVID-19 fatalities among high-risk populations urgent. Early researchers reported three striking patterns. Firstly, innate immune system impaired vitamin deficiency, would predispose sufferers viral infections COVID-19. Vitamin deficiency also increases activity X-chromosome-linked ‚ÄúRenin-Angiotensin‚Äù System, making vitamin deficient individuals (especially men) susceptible COVID-19's deadly ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù (dramatic immune system overreaction). Secondly, groups highest risk severe COVID-19 match highest risk severe vitamin deficiency. includes elderly, men, ethnic groups whose skin naturally rich melanin (if living outside tropics), avoid sun exposure cultural health reasons, live institutions, obese, and/or suffer hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes. thirdly, pattern geographical spread COVID-19 reflects higher population vitamin deficiency. within USA throughout world, COVID-19 fatality rates parallel vitamin deficiency rates. literature search performed PubMed, Google Scholar, RSMLDS, targeted Google searches providing additional sources. Although randomized controlled trial results may available eventually, correlational causal study evidence supporting link vitamin deficiency COVID-19 risks already strong supports action. 141 author groups writing primarily biological plausibility detailed vitamin deficiency explain every risk factor every complication COVID-19, agreed factors undoubtedly work. COVID-19 compared dengue fever, oral vitamin supplements 4,000 IU 10 days significantly effective 1,000 IU reducing virus replication controlling ‚Äúcytokine storm‚Äù (dramatic immune system over-reaction) responsible fatalities. Among 47 original research studies summarized here, chart reviews found serum vitamin levels predicted COVID-19 mortality rates (16 studies) linearly predicted COVID-19 illness severity (8 studies). Two causal modeling studies several analyses variance strongly supported hypothesis vitamin deficiency causal, rather bystander, factor COVID-19 outcomes. Three four studies whose findings opposed hypothesis relied upon disproven assumptions. literature review also found prophylactically correcting possible vitamin deficiency COVID-19 pandemic extremely safe. Widely recommending 2,000 IU vitamin daily populations limited ability manufacture vitamin sun virtually potential harm reasonably likely save many lives. China/Vietnam/NZ done it. That's like, 1.5B people? course need guard (not least rest world seems rolled given up) - essentially live normal lives now.  Flatten curve stop hospitals overrun, triage strategy crisis. stopped measures then, obviously curve would return upwards.

Hospitals absolutely going overrun northeast measures taken... saying fact get overrun sense fraction capacity (which mostly ad hoc emergeny space) used nonsense. keep wondering someone flip chuck molotov middle idiots throwing massive parties front NYU Washington Square Park like.

And feel hugely sorry college students trying sensible getting chances completely obliterated dumb ones. risk getting high viral load case disproportionately likely put hospital (or worse) want, I‚Äôm going I‚Äôm confident I‚Äôll better it.  refuse throw away another Spring/Summer season this.

I figure sacrifice another 1 2 warm seasons order another 30, worth it. 


As opposed potentially ended respirator shoved throat next Memorial Day. stock market see yet.  fucking kidding me? could probably start clicking links first comment replied. I'm first class engineering one best schools country, honey bunny. :)  reddit education may value know Covid19 anything fuck around with, people underestimate virus....ALL TIME. THAT'S FUCKING please continue self-important rant continue warn people wear masks CONTINUE take seriously. Wow, law. Like law made holocaust legal.

You mean law staying doors? tbh really aware people dying flu. Anyway, covid much, much dangerous flu.

COVID dangerous flu. ""Much, much dangerous"" pretty think dodging questin. talking while, answered ""how would feel highly possible givenc covid person died.""

I'm 25 years old. life 1-2 million Americans died pneumonia influenza. can't speak numbers country, they're probably comparable terms overall death rate. You, me, everyone else planet can't say sure never asymptomatically spread disease eventually killed another pretty sure feel vert bad it, want admit reason. 

No honestly 100% okay that. grandma died pneumonia. blame anyone giving pneumonia. 97 years old, dying transmittable illness age completely normal. mena, tacked headlong explain even pretty sure given somebody died, still feel fine even case.

I feel fine way feel fine. Transmittable illnesses thing live with. unreasonable expect entirety society put hold nobody dies transmittable illnesses. Australia constitution charter rights ? sounds like preventing travel within ones country Canadian Charter Rights Freedoms Yeah rate nonsensical, it‚Äôs highly likely point vaccine approved gets anywhere near that. Lol. need get 4chan, champ. Maybe college  Correlation, causation. Nice! That's awesome thought include countries better Sweden, instead 12 countries worse them, including Spain, UK, Italy. matter appointed judge, still law. need think people need stay home whats problem people saying they're going next spring? got temporary ban weeks ago making comment. Yeah logic empathy  still actively quite mad this. walked around like idiot solid month more. 

It shoots straight credibility. Social Dilemma. watched Netflix last night. Basically reddit nutshell. Social media shown bad mental health, believe. problem specific facebook, although case right well. family also fine risk feel same. ü•∞ Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Quite likely honest. Everybody thinks vaccine end year. possible Phase III results good, people realize neither companies politicians emphasize that.

It already unbelievably good news safe effective vaccine time next year, let alone widely available. reason are. entire website infected COVID-denying trolls. Kinda stupid even assume made lab. Anyone even passed high school biology class knows bats (which essentially make backbone COVID-19) fucking disease magnets one weakest immune systems animal could have, reason drop dead built immunity diseases.  don‚Äôt see wash hands immediately. Funny thing lockdowns making child hunger starvation astronomically worse several orders people around world expected die hunger result disruptions food supplies economic harms caused lockdowns would died COVID even worst case models. Yeah, rulings Trump judges definitely smartest thing 22k cases California.

The highest spikes 12.8k day 9.5k rolling 14 day average didn‚Äôt exactly seem like small numbers even managed. Big ten football back!! I‚Äôm excited. Hopefully college‚Äôs league follow! 

Plus gym opened. worked yesterday great back gym. missed much. Plus loved machines spread far apart!

I feel like life finally almost put back together! Hopefully college person classes spring semester instead hybrid. life complete ;) yes get swabbed.

but labs process swabs behind. every week it‚Äôs still lonely. I‚Äôm huge extrovert like talking people whole thing super difficult. 95% week I‚Äôm inside even going store people around feels like fun field trip. supposed meet new people first semester student first place litterally events, clubs, sports, etc.?

You look people boat. there's going lot them!

You contact couple people classes say, ""Hey, would like get together person study session next Tuesday?"" discussing homework problems, find might interesting enough hang social context.

You send email president last year's Local Sports Team Fan Club / Random Hobby Club / Co-Rec Soccer Team say ""Hey, guys planning online info session meeting? I'd interested checking out."" (And even existing members planned one, might result interest.)

You see there's anybody college advertising small get-together Meetup. post one Meetup mention group split several groups gets big.

You see there's Facebook group students college ask people seem like might interesting they'd like hang out.

If residential college, there's probably Office Student Life (or something similarly-named) traditionally plans student events. (If living dorm, maybe contact Resident Advisor Resident Director first.) Ask plans assisting student social activities current conditions. They're probably going scrambling around frantically point, might still get useful info able spark productive conversation.

Note: ways, lot like common older-adult problem ""I graduated college moved new city, make friends now?"" (I feel like sort thing [Captain would good advice about, see anybody's asked sort situation no, zoom cocktail parties actually thing lol. Nobody apparently does... although TBF guess actual cocktail party would slightly older age bracket college students. family Mother's Day via Zoom social club I'm online tea party. (Not making up! drink tea!)

A large musical group I'm social sessions spent half hour chatting via Microsoft Teams 15-20 minutes playing trivia Kahoot. (We're going try ""concert"" person records parts couple pieces director audio-edits together.) nature clubs area (e.g. Audubon Society) holding monthly program meetings online. friends playing D&amp;D together online via Skype. I've heard friends watching e-sports home time shooting shit via Discord. 132 upvotes. vast majority people believe that. fucking mind blowing absolutely stupid people are. sweden sparsely populated

Lol keep hearing this, think live alone spread little cottages? large areas uninhabited land drives average, cities (where nerely people live) densely populated european cities. 

We barely anything, noone ever wore mask, deaths almost zero months. facts.  virus gonna yeet us yeet eh? bad deal Lmao ‚Äúcouple bucks‚Äù constitutes massive part economy underpins schooling, healthcare, public services standards living Spain. Spanish people probably Karens want haircuts anyway right? No, mean get it, disease likely severe someone got grocery store, based intent go bars, etc you‚Äôd exposed much virus particles. appears right exposed virus particles makes symptoms worse. Get ready North Florida. Doctors hate me! I‚Äôll never forget mask lie, especially know president knew first week February virus airborne deadly flu. 

Now see ‚ÄúCDC says‚Äù don‚Äôt read helpful statement facts. read behavior shaping. ‚ÄúMasks don‚Äôt work‚Äù make us stop buying self-protective masks. 

What giving time line here? Maybe encourages people businesses plan around time? sure. asthma plan get vaccine ***and*** continue protocols (masks, social distance, frequent hand hygiene, avoid crowds esp indoors, etc.) 

I won‚Äôt going movies (üò≠) local community spread, however long takes, probably indoor restaurants either üò£. Also value education. would gone work pays bills jobs falling skies right someone education degree experience anything teaching. la queenCharlotte....instrumental getting public approval small pox inoculations. actually good way get support vaccines. This. 12 weeks ‚Äùhard lockdown‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt clear virus. Hell, 52 weeks lockdown vaccine wouldn‚Äôt eradicate it. People need realize virus going stay around, maybe permanently low levels, probably seasonal infection. end day, authorities responsable nuancing reassure 60 cases/day reported state 10 million people isn‚Äôt cause barricade world. 

I‚Äôm saying everyone open totally point, I‚Äôm saying long benchmark people feeling safe go life 0 cases past year, never getting this. Wow, eat today too?

That must mean world hunger solved. Certainly, disagree all, cases people dying completely unrelated causes (car accidents, whatever else) COVID plays part it.

The information framed details, know. Obviously 6% even 50% 70%, lets act like 99%-100%. clear unambiguous goalpost shifting finally made ""peak"" become staunchly anti-lockdown. curve flat months now, states fully open since early mid summer fine. one trouble finding hospital bed Georgia. clear we've slowed eventually reach herd immunity. expect illusive ""second wave"" happen all. might see occasional spikes certain areas peaked yet, overall virus clearly waning. Fellow asthmatic. heard / read nearly bad feared, people pre-existing breathing issues asthma? we'll sue enjoin federal court win, like happening across country. Well plan take care meet family, also risking family?

What give family? feel bad that? obviously paying attention, [because already gram would open days early, swears they're better way. dont agree lol. walking sidewalk ""catch car"" though. Specifically regarding mask issue, racism angle kind reach imo. 

I plenty friends receiving end 'anti-asian sentiment' result COVID, seems mask drama predominantly rooted ignorance, fear, machismo, since issue politicized there's element wanting 'signal' 100% behind Repub party line. nice. another cheap 'Made China' product.   think right. Many restaurants close every year. Many retail stores probably struggling. Amazon competition many stores pandemic. shock close maybe closed really needed things reopen new opportunities. common HVAC heating systems vs radiators? remember argue people masks would work based common sense couple studies looked pubmed. would say shit like ‚Äúso you‚Äôre saying know World Health Organization?‚Äù 

Officials really fucked initial response masks.  Lol, 6 feet ain't gonna help enclosed space. really serious pre-existing condition, let 6 feet thing lull false sense safety. Yeah lack empathy common sense profound. definitely trolling definitely disgusting human being. I‚Äôm sorry anyone dealing this. üòû Agreed 100%

I'd rather living ""reckless"" state like Georgia, South Dakota, Florida trapped current state. there's universe I'd want live state like New York California.

This virus become extremely political, fear things looking November beyond, regardless wins. Yes, know. saying singularly ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù deaths? I‚Äôve asked fail respond simple question.

I would say surely recognize viral pandemic genocide different things, honestly might hoping much you. People get upset someone actually attacks actively tries kill them. awful family member die. tragedy someone family die car wreck. would whole level someone going different family member's houses murdering them. would completely different. would also scared person going come murder next. targeting family. People sad situation, also scared. attacked right soil. worried another attack happening them. kind feeling school shootings. People scared.

People saddened covid deaths. noone actively trying kill them. feeling different. known group people sneaking around infecting people covid purpose, would different. aren't. People best keep going wishing best.

The guy responded right though. majority peolle country affected directly. majority people know someone personally died. Even know someone, odds close them. commenter trying say ""right"". stating reality. I've noticed lot redditors hard time understanding concept. Everything site revolves around emotion. trying say people feeling. guy's thoughts based reality. telling people feeling. absolutely right. living like me. I'm around people day gotten good idea average person dealing it. exposed deaths first hand. low percentage people died made majority people affected. reality. is. matter think happening, happening. one classes school. reality I'm glad people actually telling like is. Without basing everything emotion. People need hear truth too. even go like though

South Korea (albeit much smaller nation) 367 deaths. responded time frame USA did.

A *lot* people die way did. third world countries, point still valid Unfortunately, can't even count governments information make decisions. lost lot faith government leaders lied air quality 9/11. asthma got worse breathing air downtown months.  


I saw Sandy handled. hard hit neighborhood, lost power week. own. help government, etc. harder hit areas needed more, understandably. prior experiences power outages less 24 hours. would see ice trucks news areas though that's would happen. didn't. 


Now, I'm saying go super prepper, least 2 weeks non-perishables, flashlights, matches, wipes, prescriptions, etc. part prep kit. buy food would eat normally non perishables. coffee addict like me, include French press small drip funnel. get shelf stable milk, take milk coffee.  


Fortunately, work company flexible work home policy. job done remotely. first case hit NYC area, talked boss let know might need work home. 2nd week, asked received permission work home.  started stocking essentials late January.  


The problem everyone work home. understanding supervisor. people can't afford buy extra supplies. governments better protect people. STOP GIVING TERRORISTS IDEAS GUYS! lol saying they‚Äôre not?   Sad thing administration could issued executive order prevent selling N95 masks consumers, save medical personnel tell people try wear face coverings possible. think CDC lie fear public buying panic. mean CDC correct, distrust created public still affecting us.  Unfortunately scrutinized showed lot bullshit. yes part process.. 

I'm sorry whole idea scientific method consensus repeatability. it‚Äôs you‚Äôre inability accept criticism country dismissing large amount deaths ‚Äúbig whoop we‚Äôre still best‚Äù lets people know don‚Äôt empathy. it‚Äôs hard draw conclusions people like nobody said ‚Äúglad‚Äù don‚Äôt care hasn‚Äôt hit home yet bet loved one died you‚Äôd singing far different tune That's point. I'm Lombardy vacation various areas country summer.

Yes people careful rules, similar ones Spain France (masks closed spaces, public transportations, reduced capacity stores, etc). People super social too, restaurants bars get packed times people careless masks. gym, example, like pre pandemics except disinfect use. Also, exercising always wear mask almost nobody even try enforce it.

When went south beach, felt like Covid never terms little care people put it. Aside laying mask mouth every while.

I mean aside stadiums nightclubs closed, life pretty much back normal.

And yet cases deaths France Spain slowly ""skyrocketed"" (relatively speaking ofc) post lockdown situation stayed pretty calm. Further, 3 countries processing roughly 100K tests day positivity rate ranged 1/2%, hovering around 5/7% France 10%+ Spain. asked one time deleted comment said wasn‚Äôt helpful. bizarre. literally admitted lied misstep. confidence that? anything, US lot rural areas low density population complaining covid city problem there's virus near them, rates go vertical late.

 US land area urban. Europe lot large cities - look Asia really large cities. Even large cities US small compared -- NYC 9million people v Shanghai 26 million

&amp;#x200B;

The failure US comes national leadership done worse nothing. confused undermined staff every opportunity. continues week without stop. still don‚Äôt understand perspective blaming host...like people shaming restaurant bar owners reopening businesses allowed ‚Äúgiving people place go‚Äù

Just like before-times, individual needs assess risk level decide they‚Äôre ready leave house day. also includes risk levels live care (ailing spouse, aging parents, work nursing home, etc). Happy cake day? fair. saw people hoarded toilet paper paper towels. I‚Äôm saying lied us way, stop idiots hoarding essential items health workers desperately need? People absolutely stand way closer masks. I'd say get false sense security. Seriously... fucked lied instead saying ‚Äúwe know scary please limit purchase one pack per person stores‚Äù  Okay me, want anyone belong NY NY right now. Lmfao forgetting countless political comments? Oh, ones go narrative, nice feel like type winning parallels quite sadly record high temps Death Valley, CA. agree premise comment, there's way reach 1M deaths. Pretty sure students ‚Äúfreaking out‚Äù fit one categories:

1) asthma condition would put risk bad outcome catch it;

2) really, really want stay campus worried partying ruin them.

As someone categories school, don‚Äôt blame them. Gates pointed though, COVID-19 also spread ‚Äútalking singing‚Äù normal every day non-symptomatic behavior, new gotcha. Everyone already knows cover mouth cough sneeze spreads germs. COVID doesn‚Äôt require anything drastic sneeze though. Feb left trying impeach President Trump anything could discredit him. called xenophobic Nancy Pelosi stopping travel China, least dozen high ranking democrats mocked said everything perfectly safe. agree, theres way people would gotten board close 3 weeks. Thanks non-answer That's fine vaccines body mounts immune response vaccine causing symptoms. get sort thing flu shot. 200,000 people dead USA terrible response virus. Take bullshit somewhere else. Also, seprate comment probably get removed - perfect Covid response failed, China fine? made comparison earlier, got removed.   full truth come eventually China pay, big time. happened Arkansas today? Backlog dump?? Unpopular opinon, give shit Bill Gates thinks Covid. Unless pulled safe vaccine outta ass new version Windows ready released, care ""again"" Yep. gun? yes ebola bad example.. Thats ebola gets sick.. makes bed ridden there's little chance spread others unless taking care close proximity areas ebola outbreaks are. could modified slightly less onset symptoms longer incubation period would increase R number dramatically. Gates come announce wearing mask keeps 5G out. mean, crazy folks make 40% US population eager believe crackpot conspiracy theories, give ones HELP society. Serious question - think states locking creating measures pertains outbreak relevant sub? so, different national organization thousands thousands people involved making covid related measures?

This much impact Massachusetts closing restaurants bars, potentially even more, *directly* related Covid19. Glad someone countering claim. mods keep allowing stupid fucking claims daily chat thread ignoring reports misinformation. There's one right taken down. straight racism conspiracy theory. at? South America? Tell it. NZ perfect developed country policy, basically failed. strict border management also clearly unmaintainable, intend participate international trade travel. Ding ding ding. Virologists rely heavily gain function research, despite probably dangerous kind research done earth. reckless practice matter time lapse security would cause major damage life world economy. Thankfully, extinction level time, next time may lucky. End practice NOW. quarantine wasn‚Äôt taken seriously first place people caused drive meant, people demanding things started opening yes, went business normal

I‚Äôm gonna say didn‚Äôt say did. It‚Äôs true stand behind it. problem yes, bunch selfish people caused effective first place. wrong? kind universal healthcare coverage help fund preventative healthcare reduce underlying issues.

I hand Americans though, pretty ballsy play chicken virus many underlying issues expensive healthcare system. maybe Americans really big Darwinian selection?  still make infected bat pangolin kiss lab, generating genetic results natural mutation.

It's possible happened, since Wuhan Institute Virology responsible lot research coronaviruses bats located in... Wuhan. unlikely, difficult disprove, since difficult prove something exist. 

And happened, China would motivated cover up. conspiracy theorists belief government

Maybe 200IQ move he's made, makes believe government become super buddies know corona skeptics believe anything RIVM tell them, time things believe like ""masks valuable!"" agree. huge chunk people refusing comply authoritarian, dear leader come start saying strong response needed would fallen line. Americans love project individualist personality quickly adapt however group tells think would great think Canada wants us (especially year). guy Louisianas 

I grew left college. 

Question - national championship year, LSU still national champion 2021? getting downvoted agree 100%

This highly contagious respiratory virus, going anywhere reach herd immunity (either naturally via vaccination). People absolutely delusional think locked super hard month we'd side thing restrictions. always knew soon restrictions lifted would see cases come back up. beginning flatting curve, slowing spread keep hospitals getting overwhelmed, acknowledged accepted people going die *and deaths could prevented*. goalpost shifting gaslighting people insist eradication always goal crazy. 

I know subreddit absolutely hates Sweden, proof lockdowns necessary. know, economy significantly better shape European neighbors. truth is, know handled ""the best way"" done with. highest deaths per capita meaningless. two years highest deaths per capita? front-load deaths power through, spread slowly painfully, either way virus gonna virus.  also happened February, well Northern hemisphere countries. Flu went almost nothing.

It's good news. may even kill one flu strains. COVID cause heart attacks

Yes one example used. heart attacks covid related, even covid. could heart disease years without knowing it.

While link proves doctors required disclose covid patient dies, document say doctors *required* schedule autopsy every single suspected known covid victim make sure actually covid killed them.

So can't see document really proves points wrong

And since covid's symptoms actually common lot diseases symptoms, think would easy doctor assume patient covid really didn't.


Do sources saying every covid victim autopsied? Yet it‚Äôs hard deny reasoning Fauci fact repeat anti-mask rhetoric. believe Fauci‚Äôs heart good place, point regard. think people would fine arresting someone responsible hundreds thousands deaths even break laws.

I wonder limit is. 100 000 few. Hitler's 11 million enough? far know break American laws.

Do think something lawful organ harvest Uighurs? mean remember first started talking people questioning masks always touching face, possibly putting risk.

What overestimate intelligence general population. Absolutely. mostly kids early 20s absolutely can't afford things right now, age? I'd like come read comments 10 years steady job, family mortgage. understand still grasped fact i'm talking quality life anymore. downvoted them, people think silly. someone living Vermont, think maybe 60% folks wear masks. Wife works retail stories crazy nutters refuse wear masks (muh freedumbs) wear mask chins nothing. store taken stance ""we force people wear masks we're afraid someone shoot place."" keep mouth shut people interact ""covid hoax"" crazies. governors mask mandate basically ""lead example engage crazies.""

The sad part apparently better lot places country.

**Edit: came back town recycle center earlier today two town employees interacted wearing masks either. think state right things could reasonably done, people dumb places USA.** baseball bat slid middle. Oops, how'd get there? Given field years expertise, feel information start regarding properties coronavirus. They've announced 1 month increments time. There's benefit announcing closed longer. Instead view situation (which great) keep extending it. gives flexibility anyways. No. 15,000 deaths 15,000 deaths. horrible, preventable loss life. Period.  that‚Äôs island. It‚Äôs enormous leap say stayed locked two weeks would over. soon someone brought covid back another country someone travelled US it, we‚Äôd right back started. K

Edit: apparently saying ""K"" incoherent jumble words ad hominem lol. ha, freaking kidding? youtube video tucker carlson's show? what, feel like linking appearance Bannon's podcast? Freedom important thing. dont freedom, arent alive. want able scrutinize government without imprisoned. yet furin cleave site shows clear insertion, mutation, technique used frequently gain function research. time discussion gain function research FAR dangerous conducted, may drag virologists kicking screaming point. muh Eric weinstein fake whistleblower Hong Kong paid CIA never worked virus lab That's right, masks effective, put go outside keep on, whole time, eating outside, taking ""for little"". effect mask becomes 0, take start eating unsafe environment i.e. outside home. know exactly virus go outside house, can't take mask presume restaurant bar ""safe environment"" safe everybody goes inside somehow checked door COVID 19, method, places considered full COVID 19. message mishandled day 1, wonder got muddled... old guys what‚Äôs highest education? sure use CRS points calculator see husband enough points apply Express Entry sooner later (cut point 472?) 

If not, guys probably Working Holiday visa RO (must 35 years old), get NOC 0,A,B job land Canada, apply PNP (BC PNP Tech Pilot could good husband software engineer)

Start getting education (ECA) assessed company like WES, get highest points get IELTS General Training test English, apply Express Entry Permanent Residency wait working holiday visa. China already news propaganda vaccination within china necessary. means there's absolutely negative impacts way fight thing containment. Remember 15 people? R NUMBER 1! ""They r gonna die anyway, sooner later"" 2 million. Hey that's another interesting link. sure methodology that, think credible. I'm going peruse site more.

I pick Infections high-impacted states began slow reaching 10-35% population prevalence.

Not sure exactly, estimates places like Texas Florida cumulative infection rate (based serological surveys) 6 10% IIRC *after* infection rate already started decline. could call ""training masks"" Please clap win? think you‚Äôre getting Little Bighorn Battlefield Wounded Knee Massacre site confused.

Wounded Knee Pine Ridge Indian Reservation South Dakota, belongs Oglala Lakota. tour take find mass grave surrounded active graveyard. Wounded Knee battle. massacre 300+ unarmed women, men, children murdered US Calvary cold blood. Calvary awarded medals honor efforts.

Little Bighorn (aka Greasy Grass) Crow Agency Montana. site Custer‚Äôs grave, sits atop hill surrounded Crow. last great battle Indian Wars took place Custer defeated. sounds like place actually visited. get Greasy Grass Black Hills, drive parts Wyoming Montana. Again, located Montana, South Dakota. Yes would inconvenient shareholders. Scary thing numbers even official counts, we're really slowing virus much. hit 100K 200K roughly amount time (4 months). 300K year end looking outlandish anymore, sad &amp; scary. remember fiance thinking bit overcautious openly says 100% correct means 1 1650 people alive start pandemic killed Covid. Remember 2 million prediction I've ordering groceries takeout. decided stop wiping everything clorox wipes weeks ago. guys? got tested, place sprung **$50** copay me! said insurance covered test, still needed pay copay since technically ""urgent care"" visit!

I live poverty line. people like can't afford get tested, could end accidental silent spreaders. knew. Wait second. Keep us people it. correct regular viral load. Note typical load defined whether wearing mask (which decrease load) not. That's another nuance.

The reality can't even get regular people put piece cloth mouth. portion population does, half properly. 

Without intelligent guidance universal enforcement mandates, stuck mish mash rules made really understand basic transmission modes let alone nuances. 

Stay safe help can. Eventually get this. Many people say hospitals listing everything COVID, personally think might higher. High profile people like Elon Musk were/are saying things like get hit bus COVID say died COVID. Medical bills expensive. Yea probably move mothers day monday Thursday right? best gift give mother absence, absence work make her. Clearly, people dying CO2 poisoning masks. remember first cases popping washington state? good times viruses worry, gone Easter.... Next year. Woohoo!!!! 

But seriously FML. Battling COVID right husband two teens. exhausting, scary. We're #1! Oh wait... bad now?  really need healing crystals magnets people say mockingly even sure bathroom use. find idea armed insurrection laughable group. Wear mask. probably 240,000 election day.  Agreed. Yea sorry gift totally sent never got you, must got lost mail...ya know post office days! Remember 200,000 lot people, could count many. also 0.06 unsubstantial amount. one fake  Muh freedoms! RIP dude Vote! Hardly. average age death 79.

These prime age adults children beginning lives.

They're old people, vast majority comorbidities significantly higher risk younger cohorts population. Praying wont anything govt keeps weird shit. testing symptomatic folks true numbers much much higher this. govt absolutely counterproductive things like holding political rallies nation wide exams lakhs students.

I appreciate sympathy criticism much warranted right USA

 -Trump It‚Äôll 500k winter I‚Äôll bet.  least year end

No way lol, anything winter exacerbate covid since people stay inside respiratory diseases worse winter.

It's around mid September, there's 3.5 months left 105 days. I'm gonna guess another 100K deaths _at least_, likely well 140/150K deaths. I‚Äôm glad got better. first COVID death happen someone know. sad one pushed death toll 200k. That's cause lazy. 

I cited sources...

So good 'Sir Billy Conley' ya. brats Let‚Äôs shoot quarter milly! Woo! America great let‚Äôs keep way! lol would affect Seems like got summer bump quite hot people wearing masks. Means people mostly indoors avoid heat maskless. Phoenix ideal location type spread.

In winter spread effectively indoors outdoors north viruses typically like cold. got preview March tail end cold season. GOP‚Äôs attempts downplay pandemic stupidly thought could save economy BSing, fact save economy instead created cult misinformed citizens refusing social distance wear masks. Smh. Exactly. I've practically screaming this, Covid-19, it? Something killing awful lot people Covid darn better figure is. Stupid frustrating, eh?  excess deaths Aug. 22 talked guy grocery store yesterday (wearing mask nose) told 10,000 people died COVID-19. much Trump Virus *going away like magic.* numbers pretty fucking high. 21 per 1,000 one 50.  want absolute numbers? quick back envelope, 28.09 million pop Nepal ~20 births per 1000 population per year, would mean increase ~7,850 ~11,800 still births years time, 329 stillbirths per month. 

Maybe ton country 28.09 million, insignificant. I‚Äôd like thank academy.... Unfortunately large portion America longer believes science despite things science done us. remember 3M projections US people, we're greatest powerful nation, comes people getting sick suddenly get fatalistic helpless

Because birth Americans force fed patriotic military superiority bullshit somehow better lesser people gross communist countries fact bunch fat, ignorant, hateful, cowardly, lazy fuck faces actually less clean world despite inventions innovations industries US cultivated since inception still refuse use ever efficient hygenic bidet heaven forbid might like warm stream cleanliness shot directly never maintained jungle asshole. hate country everyone refuses give shit anyone themselves. Fucking traitors. Fuck face taxes jobs giant turd dipped tang call president destroyed everything votes. Damn, population Salt Lake City. Imagine devastation SLC razed. nah, people still think made up. We'll lucky keep 500k rate. excess deaths Aug. 22 think sick, excluding alcohol related, since 2012. woulda gotten gf Friday got fever it. 

Ah well, yeah flu sucks understanding. People usually talk colds flu they're brutal. 

And yeah...probably ideal time uptick sick people hospital visits. remember early February ‚Äúdid math‚Äù /r/Coronavirus post arrived conservative estimate 300,000 dead US, laughed downvoted. It‚Äôs 7 months, I‚Äôm sad right. Fun times! thing cheese  think work  People need understand rest country either eliminated get 10 cases day... Victoria going alone different strategy simply wouldn‚Äôt smart.. mention neighbours China, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand going heavy suppression tactic well. Following strategy much important Europe example No, means 78% people confirmed infected recovered.

So total infected - currently infected - dead = recovered. Getting downvoted quoting trumps words earlier year. Shit even recording.  worries jokes needed help get us difficult times. wanted clear common misconception pneumonia. Science literally backs up. Sure small exceptions, many fine, even issues afterwards heal website garbage, entire screen filled 4 different ads clicked Haha take award enjoy 


The thing gets me. ok. know maybe marked covid isn't. But, always opposite. many marked covid fit idiots narrative ""its bad"" üéâüéä think science knows, actually. less /s Well...at least we‚Äôre winning again, say Merry Christmas again, we‚Äôre great again, we‚Äôre respected again, think? That's laugh hard insults John Oliver throws way. One favorites called Tucker Carlson human boat shoe. please dont link yes men political ideology like come excess deaths Aug. 22 Could share sources demonstrate mean? send link. neighbor left kids trick r treat, doesnt want kids anymore poisons pixie sticks. Ya know...the one time happened.  ? scientist fled Hong Kong

hm cant think political motivations accusing China Oh 0.06% Americans üò¢ sub echo chamber CCP propaganda. already CCP created article Bannons involvement. 

And bots work, general consensus most, China lying. mean even President acknowledged worse flu. 'War pathogens!'?? horribly tragic.

For perspective...

9-11: 2,977 

Vietnam: 58,220

ww2: 291,557 US dead

Civil war: 498,332 pretty bad I'm reading many states pretty much rolling back social distancing restrictions. going loooong winter. know hospitals receive $38,000 every reported Covid death?????????? 

/s case needed man! woman! don‚Äôt know. [r/justiceserved  I‚Äôm disappointed. going post article state-run media, least post state-run media [the country article try want, long huge chunk population everything opposition, efforts almost useless. WOOOO

USA! USA! USA!

NUMBER 1 BABY!

GREATEST COUNTRY EARTH, MURICA FUCK YEAH I'M GONNA GO GET AR-15 CALL ICE MEXICAN CELEBRATE wait right source output CCP easily bury evidence even disappear. claim protest get away it. Good point. catch pneumonia, brought cold, flu, etc winning foretold? every state cabins wilderness outhouses. becomes trope though Arkansas seems. beaver lake area, east lake buffalo river areas would perfect mostly away people. still want road access would assume.  country good. America worst.
 
Why scenario you? unable acknowledge failures America compared countries? even mean? That's hard fail. Wow.

You can't compare confirmed deaths ""oh might it, btw, where's $13k check?""

We shutdowns like reporting deaths now.

Again, H1N1 deadly first reported, 10-fold Butt stump wiggling intensifies! It‚Äôs hoax. One day, like miracle disappear. UK government announced 100 billion dollar testing program test something like 10 million people day? program going take effect?  It‚Äôs weak sarcasm.  It‚Äôs good enough published Zenodo. else want know? long Democrats trying impeach trump again?

Rather admitting Donald 1 brain cell incapable multitasking, not? made bet friend start covid he'd owe bottle whiskey every thousand US deaths. often wonder I'll storing 50,000 bottles.. Number 1!

Specially since guy left testing kits virus wouldn‚Äôt exist 3 years left office. douche nozzle guy? Amirite? complete nonsense. big portion population infected outset lost tens thousands lives process, far outpacing state deaths. think California close double population still less half deaths. CA locked infection hit hard experienced second peak people went outside summer. New York, hand, already many people infected recovered never saw second bump. Gives hope fear reinfection largely unfounded.  Remember said gonna like Spanish flu? close 20 million... want analyse case lockdown fails control virus, look Argentina intelligent one-liner. must one smart ones. People know better comparing flu, made people expect behave like flu.  remember 5 prediction?  Way money made long term care Spot on...

My area STILL red bleeds. I'm definitely voting but, vote count one less 45.

Get rid two team tennis game would help make possible someone millionaire run.... 

I see millions billions dollars spent campaigning can't wrap head around it. Plus, fact candidates people clue middle class lives let alone poverty believe hard work anybody become millionaire like them. 

Both sides problem quit party lines never end. haha got em It‚Äôs global cooling it‚Äôs like 6 months Sorry, supposed sort weak sarcasm idiot? Typical americans trying blame everyone else. 

Nop, (the americans) fault. ones making fun covid since started, refusing wear masks, respecting social distancing claiming whole thing ''propaganda'' ''the governments way controlling us''. I've saying average american brain dead years everyone know irl agrees reason people reddit (mostly americans) refuse admit keep acting like superior every country pandemic proved right. üèÖ Right. That's fucking said.

The 100,000-240,000 number referenced white house. lockdown fully enforced instead half assing feds going ways kill many people possible ""weaken opponents"" situation would control. countries properly followed advice experts recovering. Americans wanted party, young older generations instead following it. constant lying leadership help, I'm 100% sure number safe much higher 200k.

Even behind, bring normalcy requested wear masks sand maintain social distancing quarantine Covid, people dead set ""muh freedom"". people got went way attend parties pubs instead staying homes quarantine effing two weeks. even that.

China may may started death responsible American leadership ""law order"" (LOL) legal citizens.

Don't use Facebook &amp; Twitter *only* source news. They're employees come said promote bold faced lies. Woo! We‚Äôre number one! USA USA USA üá∫üá∏ average age COVID deaths life expectancy ordinary American.  Yup. Congrats Meh. Call hit 1,000,000. Making America great one death time compare Europe? US much worse Europe? need comparison determine bad mismanaged US.  Fair enough, even bay area probably dozen microclimates, Labor Day weekend brutally hot dry much state. dont think work masks. trying push blame Democrats trying investigate President crimes.

Imagine trying say trump made covid priority February democrats screaming bloody murder impeachment. embarrassed party threw law, order, judicial process allowing witnesses speak.

I party democrats selling tickets circus ultimately bombed. remember this: Anyone said Trump guilty willing testify oath. Anyone said innocent willing testify oath.

Anyone paraphrases usually full crap. believe covid real deadly however don‚Äôt trust numbers due 4 separate people know know went get tests done see it. 4 people said line ridiculous went home instead taking test (which yes probably good thing like randomly selected take tests real symptoms shown) however week later leaving facility supposed test taking test received letter mail saying positive. believe people still documentation prove also. one coworkers dads died literally natural causes stuck house last 2ish years due health tried calling death covid death. think covid bad causing problems world think numbers even close accurate though. Meh, reasoning. spoke one people three months ago. shocked Florida death rate entire state 200-ish day (can‚Äôt remember exact number). thought 1000-s. Damn, live? live NJ right NYC pretty much everyone knows someone died point even small parking lot sized town memorial up. one would joke around like that. Dude it‚Äôll Easter cool off. Easter? sure yet. Give time. I'm still convinced official number Infected. say least twice big Well said!  50,000 say, ‚ÄúQuarter Million Deaths.‚Äù 

It rolls tomb better. Welcome majority. Remember sun warm weather would kill virus ?  Regardless believe?? fucking ideological issue, SCIENCE REAL LIFE. thought democrat hoax, incredible new information today folks. believe majority deaths rural India occur home without doctor certifying cause death. doctor certify cause death, naturally, dying covid counted. swing way user name suggestion vaccine administered. False. count car accident COVID death even positive. 

They count, example, pneumonia death COVID COVID death, COVID leads pneumonia. Well, shitty thing cases cause death falsely labeled COVID. People take run it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs small percentage. facility I‚Äôm COVID RN at, sure enough every COVID death I‚Äôve seen COVID. People take obscure instances facilities misrepresented cause death think, oh, bet 200,000 fatalities falsely labeled. nit picky nuchal cord (cord around neck) uncommon birth vast majority time present complications mom baby. finding would caught prenatal appointment, even ones ultrasound. People don‚Äôt usually know delivery.

Complications would caught would things like placental abruption, reduced fetal movements, low fluid excess fluid. No, China bad /s

In seriousness though, friends Shanghai going without masks, clubbing weekends generally good time China took strong measures lock soon figured going on. America paying price ignorance life going back normal many parts world. Wow, though December pass milestone. Maybe 250,000? Sigh. wear pants? Road 250k! So? Still quite preventable. 3%? come contact strep, staph, e. coli, salmonella every day, compared report... Yea I'm sure Viacom happy stock 25% since pandemic hit e-mails
















































/s Locked like Italy. tired bullshit one cares fuck trying hard. Haha humor way get life rn. 

In seriousness, predictions are:

Camping gear due everyone nowhere travel instead heading outside fall. 

And pending election results...baseball bats melee weapons üòÖ That's one shocking discoveries year: fact medical professionals ""believe"" medicine science. holding hope far between, hear crazy ones precisely crazy norm. least say personally met medical professionals far believe stuff. Yeah. Kinda. caused lightning strikes. One caused gender reveal explosive, fucking idiot.  many americans considered obese?  There's disgusting people buying canned Hormel Tamales like. ""Achievement unlocked!""

*Screamed Donald Trump* Coffins feel efforts limit spread, good, lessen catastrophe.

Like Fauci saying, need cases much lower fall/winter. There's enough cases spread totally control optimal conditions virus.  mask fit, use rubber band tie ends together!! Well, Trump say, ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù.  Um... congrats? Wow, thanks answer Man, karma whores really milking huh discrepancy would like 3 days date Totally! literally watching show taped PVR Feb! news clips feels like life time ago.. ‚Äú6 new cases Canada‚Äù, ‚Äúwill Covid affect travel plans?‚Äù ‚ÄúStocking toilet paper food items, beginning Italy overwhelmed. new episode watch news clips March/April. It‚Äôs crazy now. Like knew. Yet despite knowing this, went ahead purchase it. could chosen buy custom made ultra expensive device 'ethical sources' (although would argue company offering best option worker. better offer someone else, workers would taken it). didn't, price matters. 

You can't high paying labor low product/service cost. economics work make sense. Business need make money. Without ability generate profit, incentive compete innovate results best products new technology emerging improves societal quality life? 

Where jobs come without capitalism consumerism? even buy enjoy without it? Err, know took dramatic steps mitigate spread, right? completely sleep quarantine? Yes course batshit crazy. never would imagined people could believe things. are. mad lmao Ah damn good one, supply appears ran March :( Keep get gold play button! I'd make jungle hut came point what‚Äôs done done This. many family members suburban Ohio straight don‚Äôt believe numbers don‚Äôt know anyone affected. It‚Äôs hard watch put lives risk lives others risk stupid crap like bonfires crab broils. Basically limiting non contact traceable gatherings 10 wear mask public transport. Everything open running. Remember want unload cruise ship would double numbers fair. gives exactly zero shits numbers are. seems want people die. Common sense Aliens, duh community spreading case appears again.

VN case, entire industry dying man.  Seen spray wipes around (Milwaukee) however lots empty spots shelves, unlike I‚Äôve ever seen pre-covid üéâüéâüéâ # #1 BAYBEE!!! /s We're isolationist predicted back late May that'd surpass 350,000 deaths end year. 

I felt like bleak pessimistic remember charge almost changed 500,000. tourism Tucker Carlson Trust Anyone predictions stuff run stock fall/winter? par major economies significantly better lot others. per test ? compared nations
As far worlds tests even india !! 2 million? Pretty sure started April :( lysol spray clorox wipes . everything otherwise back normal like 3 months live land Canada. Something like 80% population lives within couple hundred kilometers border. population density using wrong point.

Our wilderness VAST. Canada largely unpopulated settled land, congregate CITIES live top like you.

Go bed. You're. Making. Shit. Up. Well, think become political got lot people looking reasons can't true. go find alternative stats conflicting information, stats existing cause. much so, wearing mask social distancing already proven significantly slow spread. 200k deaths counting, likely millions left crippling conditions even recovering, much could‚Äôve avoided people would wear god damn mask mindful people‚Äôs space. no, many us Americans can‚Äôt even bothered bare fucking minimum sake fellow countrymen‚Äôs health safety; we‚Äôre scum Earth proud it. U.S. given fuck people long time. mean set state fire fix this?? It‚Äôs lit Germany nation comparing US Germany currently 38k deaths adjust US population size.

That ridiculous difference. call Concast Well... Kansas flu might sound something Wizard Oz Exactly I've dealing ""my friends cousin even cousin died said Covid"". BS I'd asshole called it.  Capitalism idology divorces compassion towards anything, engrained society every last birth death.

Remember that... Wow. quoting this. recommend guy better science fiction mean Germany equivalent 38k deaths normalized population. 

And Germany comparing since 2nd largest Western superpower nation.  Stop Republican better yet, move normal country. Someone tried make analogy Facebook work page got eaten alive. 

Because ""fake"" $1200 buys poor addicts lot dope. (Happened distant relative mine. Straight bank dealer seedy motel dead nightfall.) Whi actually dying? Kids? Rioters? counting flu deaths point? Disney want kids like Bamby, would least keep restaurants closed. way know making orphans simply care profit. Article written form reassure new people well. people local doctors. gov hasn‚Äôt done much help lots hurt. Actually, does, good following measures. southern hemisphere, winter, flu respiratory diseases time low, people social distancing, washing hands using masks first time ever. Next up: higher prices Doesn‚Äôt help many sites / testing policies still require symptoms confirmed exposure. you‚Äôre waiting coworker confirm it, go business. education worth money period

Dude use imperial units, expect. ya'll make 250k Christmas? Probably honestly. want death monger ""official"" numbers. Real death toll higher that.  Remember 2 million prediction?

Choo-choo Happy get testing showed 32 cases? cost $2mm usd case? Get real. Mass graves? really it. gov didn‚Äôt allow quarantine exemptions wouldn‚Äôt 3rd wave. gov wouldn‚Äôt bs excuse cancel elections. America great again? hah, gunna say

 Cause death: Patient died

but like test first hospital make $2.3 million time ? Amazon prime 5+ days now. Viets probably superhuman then! virus itself? worse sci fi.

Human behaviour pandemic though? Utterly horrifying. insane? Getting bad fomo here

COVID killed 121 young people USA. 6,700,000 cases that's 0.002%.

Do Risk-Benefit analysis (like friends already did) decide yourself. really drank Kool-Aid, you? listen you. Wow Yes exactly people fucking furious Trump pointing cold indifference deaths.

Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) great too. alarmist, you, family, friends could next victim disease. Wear mask, practice safe distancing, vote conscience November. wonder unofficial death count then. Yea lockdowns stupid af. best overall strategy would‚Äôve protect elderly lockdown. Hindsight 20/20 though

Sweden got right except poor job protecting elderly. 90% fatalities people 70 50% nursing homes.


‚ÄúThe rationale given architect Swedish strategy, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, consider overall public health Covid-19, introduce measures long-term sustainable. Face masks never recommended almost never I'm person asked, New Yorker: locked hard, opened slowly region region basis, mask law early on. live upstate mask compliance distancing stores still high. cookout isn‚Äôt much risk long outside wear masks I've known 3 people exhibited worst symptoms short going ER said flu way, way worse. cousin's wife 2 months ago still day spells breathe nostrils can't smell anything taste. coworker hospital well time said taste profiles certain foods changed her.

So meet someone first time, must assume they're bit, prove otherwise. &amp; team foraging patrol, someone leaves sight even moment -- gotta prove bit, rejoin group. Guaran-fuckin-teed Dick shits like really good whining reddit spending plenty time themselves. fuck off? currently 800 per day: 1,000 new deaths Tuesday Friday, slightly 1,000 Saturday, 400 Sunday Monday. curves daily new cases deaths still falling (albeit fast) per Worldometer. Therefore current assumption number deaths coming weeks less previous weeks. Right now, find following Machine Learning-based model give reasonable projections: filed government allowing events take place. Thanks answer :-)

I always find sad hear people cannot talked politics, sensitive topics, inevitably leads squabbling.

Let's hope see reason day. Entering Highscore

TR__ less testing, shit load going on. many reasons need negative result for.

""people literally thinking/treating like flu, tested""

You understand mind set Chinese, shit scared thing, taken extremely serious, anyone thinks symptoms assure get tested. that, try buy flu medicine store must take details guess happens, required take test.

If trying hide would bother report details cases new cases. live city cases ago, details released contact tracing function. would bother? details released officials, also local social media.

Like said, everything see around everything people parts country tell makes feel accurate. Sorry, actual knowledge trumps guesses everytime. know know Wet Market smoke screen? initial outbreak local government sanitized market sent local Wuhan Daily reporters cover claim wet market safe shop in. two Wuhan hospitals close Wet Market know hit them. Wuhan PPE shortages. Communists take control PPE production within China least mid January (and met great resistance business owners.) 

If knew released crazy crap November, they'd stockpiled PPE December. waited turn total shitshow, Xi cancel CNY basically turn media around contagiousness virus. 1% making much money this. way holding anyone accountable. Ok cHiNa BAD!  Omg, like people come lie anonymous accounts. Crazy, right? Remember 2 million? mean, feel free prove wrong. I‚Äôm it. sure certain amount deaths misdiagnosed. Especially elderly. Oh, Aunt Petunia 98. time. 

Yeah. Brought COVID. Hate say here, predicting 1 mil positive change hemophilia get car accident bleed death ambulance shows up, fucking accident killed hemophilia. predicted virus airborne recommended mask wearing June? it‚Äôs not. didn‚Äôt die ‚Äúgoing outside thunderstorm‚Äù Um, saw Facebook page called ""The Patriot Times News"" said died car accident also tested positive Covid really died Covid. So, yeah, wrong. /s kinda was, no? lab ¬´¬†in field¬†¬ª... knew risks there... China, India, Brazil comparative US geographically population-wise, 'Nam NZ really comparable way.  pneumonia COVID reported together causes death? statistics talk include group COVID addition pneumonia?

COVID induced pneumonia thing. ""research"" seem peer-reviewed confirmed scientists. However, research virus natural confirmed groups researchers: know age group makes reddit. Stop lying. Fr, hey mods üëã I'm you. zero way prove one event caused deaths. worst part we're approaching busy time year.

Halloween, Election day, Thanksgiving, BLACK FUCKING FRIDAY, Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, New Years.

Each going boost travel exposure. Texas. Yeah, although I'll probably vote 3rd party anyway though. Get numbers bit least!  i‚Äôm Chicago learned positive case took subway home rush hour, that‚Äôs knew would screwed. flu kills [12,000-61,000 pneumonia kills maybe around 50,000 annually (I couldn‚Äôt find succinct average pneumonia, used [CDC total 2017 mortality 49,157). So, WORST case scenario, would 111,000 influenza pneumonia deaths end 2020. made sure say ‚Äúannually‚Äù time ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®we haven‚Äôt even hit flu season‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è we‚Äôre already 200,000. Death America, course  Living  estimate 50 million Americans infected now.

50/330 million ~15%. Need 75% reach herd immunity endemic viruses found CDC studies.

So need multiply times five.

So 200K x 5 = 1 million.

Your math results this. escaping without vaccine. caring total deaths today rather deaths per capita? ""but hoax"" Americans already died Covid people died whole world entire 2009-10 flu pandemic picked projections suited agenda best. care science then, care science now. cares himself.

But projections IHME fairy widely used days, complete trainwreck. see victory trump, dominates thoughts 2 million number wasn‚Äôt based us nothing ‚ÄúYou disagree therefore must CCP‚Äù

We even policy handle things. best, initial plan.

FDA totally screwed pooch early testing... months.

CDC, purpose designed go deal exact scenario, dead silent months upon months.

Trump likely exacerbated problems, screwed long before. America severely broken many ways. Covid 19 actually forced us finally confront things consistently ignored years, course, found wanting exactly left ignored. Yay ? We‚Äôre #1 USa South Korea, smaller hospitals doctors offices getting murdered this. one wants go unless something really serious, even though daily cases fairly low (\~100 51 million people). past 7 months surpassed number US soldiers died Afghanistan World War 1 combined Also 4 billion? What? Because...their measures far stricter? Pathetic rhetoric? Like harping ""tyranny""? Nobody clicking links. Articulate yourself, capable. already proven forced labor acceptable you. sane world, forced labor still called slavery vile accept it. But, hey, live Ivory tower, course think forcing others toil okay. everyone shorten Global Tarding? six months since outbreak.

Any system government learned way deal this, even he's bureaucratic

Unless..... Maybe lack respirators could play part too, dosn't Covid-19.

But sure lot misdiagnoses beginning. ‚ÄúIt is‚Äù feel frustration much. work fast food, I‚Äôm still getting people coming saying it‚Äôs hoax.

It‚Äôs misinformation there. laws keep telling us tests unreliable and/or don‚Äôt even test, hand positive results, dead comorbidities anyway didn‚Äôt die COVID, asthma/etc. reality that's true  Things virus suddenly mutating got ebola zaire. think people love idea punishment possible rehabilitative effect. exactly risk personally? difference two know one water right hall monitor you‚Äôre done? kind fucking depressing leadership, fucked country worst ways possible led deaths hundreds thousands citizens, still good chance staying power another 4 years. Wtf happened America Healthy every size! That's patriarchy trying control you. [What's seem hell bent digging down. want help look stupid. got covered. lag reporting new deaths meant curves falsely appeared like permanent downward trajectory since april. issue new cases per day.

Hm, permanent downward trajectory since April though? Respectfully, science's job know, science's job continually less wrong. 

May suggest Issac Asimov's excellent essay, [the relativity What? Maybe I'm confused. 

I thought point say 200k deaths ""libtards"" California? saying could possibly believe that? irony? Also remember said go away summer heat. right.. means gone testing completely pointless promoting it; articles give false hope, dangerous idiots false impression go back acting want 'a treatment right around corner' Um President need military police. president needs set example? Trump seen wearing mask every where, think would example enough? talking President here. Presidents set examples.I get military/police suggestion. Lame excuse. sense, also advantage: Chinese officials think elections.... ""I'm stupid moron ugly face big butt and...I like kiss butt."" confidence... Wish though u tried injecting disinfectant? Might work Good know refers blacks science way Scroll tableau dashboard: 

excess death estimation 192k 252k.  Last time checked spain 5% positivity rate. thats alot. Thats...a great idea

Lets hope learn something Yes!! Finally, people take seriously hope adapt *my* country asap!
S/ (Dis)honorable mention: ""I care, you?"" CHINA!!! Stop shilling china every random post. Best thing china right people think esprcially relation virus remember US around 4,000 deaths thought holy shit, it‚Äôs sad people don‚Äôt care. Empathy compassion rare people nowadays, it‚Äôs sad. turning ‚Äúme me‚Äù society it‚Äôs toxic nothing genuine anymore. Everyone seems fake. Congrats US, that's tremendous milestone! send copy via pm? wanna read well laugh ass haha time stop sanctions Cuba?

What point more. send soldiers kill, send doctors heal. less fidelity deliveries. full three week shutdown, followed mask mandates, contact tracing. could done much faster tenth money congress fed spent Covid-19 truly revealed shitty government, including mine. country debt. Worst thing is, many countries gave country lots money help pandemic, still ran nobody except gov knows went. country debt bangladesh workers still treated like crap. former president sent jail, believe political reasons only. like get involved politics seriously, fuck country's government. Surely incorrect. 15 cases soon zero months ago. Help!!! attend funeral weekend college. around maybe 8-10 people past week. None showing symptoms testing positive theres still chance could develop. 5 days since ive around people symptoms think would safe attend? Sadly, people still think way Coming campus near soon. #WE'RE WINNING NUMBERS drink least 1/3 alcohols since start Yeah? Sweden lowest infection rate That's 200,000 people died horrible death careless, doctors nurses, families. crazy long taking vaccine. Much better cannot see anyway anything could go wrong plan. redditors keen make close 100%! Narrator: 

*It fine* live? Note article talking enough vaccines world. situation may different countries subsidizing vaccine development. wife also physician tell medical field full barely competent midwits minimal continued study new developments defer standard care devised physicians mostly bureaucrats working protocols hospital profitability liability actually best patients. many physicians know much left medical school 10-15 years ago never stay abreast current research step outside umbrella liability protection staying herd. defer authority heavily political many personal vested interests. saw pandemic dangerously obtuse medical field slowly open obvious observations. Midwits. That's term types smart enough go education program understand they've told, smart enough see trends data real world synthesize conclusions. 

Masks fucking obvious start midwits resisted them. knew possibly airborne dangerous enough certainty begin acting back February. Chinese studies coming early February telling us midwit health workers looked CDC...mindlessly deferring authority rather using noodle ears. per article 21. make stat literally report ? That's 8 per 100k reference.

Your math wrong. 0.08% 8 per 10,000. 8 per 100,000. 8 per 10,000 far closer 1 1000 (it's 2 deaths per 10,000) 8 per 100,000 (which 90,000 survivals per 8 deaths). Racist much? last 4 years trump decently good job max 4 years. people Europe think way.

Also, would countries like Germany, Spain, Finland, Austria, whoever else even random country nukes US? nukes there's way would ship troops somewhere US beef, ""you guys handle yourself"" would everyone's reaction. Even US pressures leaders, would max sanctions regarding aggressor country.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, like things regarding US, US election really doesnt matter much anyone outside US much think would. We're number 1! America! Winning! talking about? entire article opinion piece end cdc called b.s. was. 

Just like science based results mean true. [The wages offer another strong incentive Dayli, originally small Cuban city Camag√ºey, join up. Going doctor's salary island $15 month 2011, says paid $125 monthly first six months Venezuela, figure rose $250 six months $325 third year. family Cuba also received bonus $50 put comorbidities death certificates? Hint: uncle idiot drank kool aid. That‚Äôs...basically exactly said yes leadership tells like is, facts without fear-mongering. suggestions appropriate actions. 

Germany New Zealand great examples this. Instead UK floppy haired Boris who's idea safety fine gather long money changing hands. know happened 1.7% patients went hospital? cocktail give better chance surviving emergency room stay? likely keep out? people barely even listened 2 weeks. beginning family members would operate strict cycle every 2 weeks, without fail, would try go somewhere something didn‚Äôt need do. Lying. r/savedyouaclick fun work, keep saying ""yea maybe 2023 things back normal"" watch faces melt. think I'm joking. People thought would month. Sadly, we're healthcare. Pretty sure going throw caution wind winter normal holidays despite means exposure risk know relatives anything close safe practices. We're going boned come back work holidays too. want time holidays get freaking COVID them. think either caught case stupid, tinfoil hat tight. might even mix ngl Bro he's talking code..poor code.

And PRICE 15 MILLION DEAD. still fail understand it. going back normal life next year matter what. availability vaccines decides many people die process. needing recommendation set actions possible long term. enough lab technicians process tests present. They're trying recruit more. plenty tests. system working well schools reopened. Let‚Äôs NEVER forget this. 

The afraid people would selfish buy N95 respirators desperately needed hospitals‚Ä¶ created narrative masks worthless UNLESS you‚Äôre one sick.

They kept revising narrative later (and countries like Czech Republic broken groupthink making grassroots projects make distribute cloth masks nationwide) damage done.

This never lie public. People sniffed contradiction statement mile away ‚Äì something allegedly works doctors nurses somehow doesn‚Äôt work you, confidence crisis brewing. look polarizing mask usage now.

--

Edit: get ton responses healthcare workers needing N95 surgical masks average Joe. Yes! MAKE CLOTH MASKS! Asian countries knew it. European countries later adopted it. CDC changed stance. honestly can‚Äôt reply comment like ‚Äì dozens folks ""original"" ideas. ;) Well... Ask Italians... Again, 2 weeks slow spread, took seriously 8 weeks, 8 months, people really dont give shit. Every stupid motherfucker work cites ""Hur dur cdc said masks work"" cause they're bunch headline skimming idiots. ignore anything go confirmation bias, *the fucking worst*. LOL, good luck that. graphs great visual state done managing spikes. know nationwide regional, really nasty flu went area (Albany NY) back February. knocked wife 4 days (i've never seen wife call sick three consecutive days, let alone four) killed one wife's co-workers. flu definitely started year bang anecdotal experience.

of course, neither wife sick since pretty sweet. looking forward winter without cold &amp; flu (while couped inside going crazy). umbilical cord quite long, one loose loop around neck common. Multiple tight loops issue. actually contained virus first place businesses would better position rn like big BOOST Covid Good thing Trump downplayed this, could really bad! broke crying twice first week March. fewer 10 deaths time. realized Americans would not:
- believe virus real
- believe virus deadly described
- trust media
- socially distance
- wear masks
- responsive meaningful way
- care others

It broken outlook humanity (once again).

The next pandemic even worse. literally even understand Wtf he's talking lockdowns strict, even 15 days enough lead collapse active cases. Especially time rapid home tests finally get approval. Meanwhile, introvert thrilled this. I'm enjoying time away toxic family (and using time work enforcing solid boundaries, that's another story). said that, understand struggle this, think important socialize safe manner possible. time pick new hobbies enjoy outdoors more! meet friend inside mask? People gonna like good news... might removed even... Looks like fake news Let‚Äôs fucking goooooooo Sounds like B1G mistake Pog Pretty sure it‚Äôs Trump‚Äôs fault failing protect citizens started way earlier face masks everything could seriously shorten turbulent times lot fewer people got sick died needlessly.

Good leadership tells like is, facts without fear-mongering. suggestions appropriate actions. 

We need hang stay safe vaccination round one ends. contagious respiratory disease. course masks help. Yep, virtually measures relaxed summer due public press eager put back. government sends mixed news, sounds like nobody actually knows guy huge portion people see masks tool oppression.

Masks mandatory enclosed spaces kinda sorta works maybe shopping centers. pubs clubs, nobody cares nobody gonna contaminate well calling cops onto pub. dad told insulin became first available Greece, aunt self sterilize syringes needles. aunt could ~40 years ago well. reality think availability syringes needles issue end. Primarily caused reaction pandemic. Let explain is: 

Walking mask bar, getting inside taking hugging friends spending hours talking close range. 

Wearing mask university taking lunch dining hall. 

Having heavily airconditioned public transport

Etc. etc. strawman nonsense.

These people (the couple, pastor, Big Moose Inn, attendees) could followed restrictions better. could tried mask more, distance more. could outside. weather incredible time; know first hand. 

And reactions people after, well stances of, say, pastor beforehand pretty clearly underline lack care. 7 dead linked spreading event, none dead actually gone wedding. living fear, taking basic precautions disease low risk for, much others.

Get fucking empathy.  mean people?! Honestly, idea. Probably discourage people going beach, even though outright ban beach going time (probably cuz outrage last time, since beach one easier places social distance contact tracing showed infections happen while.other places higher infection rates stayed open). Still no.idea close beaches. vote literally carrot dt favorite ‚Äúoh election year propaganda...‚Äù

How someone dense think 200k dead, many across globe based around American election? 2-3 many people die worst flu season ever, that's lockdowns masks social distancing shit.

""No haven't. media lies make POTUS look bad."" 

That's people get past that. invoke name specifically, say kind dogwhistle phrase like, ""If believe *their* numbers..."" means thing. Imagine 5yo child right now. next 2 years public interactions characterized pandemic safety. 

I'm curious what, any, effect resultant adults. 2 years leave deep pathways developing minds? Like... 20 years bunch extremely sanitary 25 year olds? generation whole hug less? 

Or maybe effect? OMG economic impact worse Sweden compared Scandinavian countries went harder lock downs? give effectiveness percentage percent people gain complete immunity suppressed effects virus added weighted fashion?  America First! dude, stop fucking me. stressful day 20 wholesome awards seriously people doing? go enjoy life. numerous things less risk. level isolation likely worse virus modern age. That‚Äôs pretty edgy bro That‚Äôs good question. making comment, realize don‚Äôt know much outside personal experiences. know son government sponsored insurance couple brain surgeries hospitalizations bills totaled well 6 figures. covered, mean looked cost surgery entire hospital stay, covid 19 pennies comparison. 

I don‚Äôt believe US doctors keep people hospitalized longer need to. kids born usually kick us hospitals quickly even wanted stay. 

So it‚Äôs hard put 2 2 together doesn‚Äôt really add world. again, doesn‚Äôt mean doesn‚Äôt happen. going called American virus? one contests masks effective,

Well that's whole point, it. concerted effort convince us otherwise.  right, people see positive example Donny set bar low.

Blanket Ban = lack experience organization skill plan actual scientific/reasonable response manage spread break infection chain.

This happened Xinjiang weeks ago well, chaotic planning, blanket ban everywhere forcing people repeat 14 day quarantine twice (). much stupidity. worried? pay everything. Go look UN funding numbers, everyone wants hand out.  Yeah buy lot tests too! explains part it! /s I‚Äôm AR well. keep fighting good fight. fear it‚Äôs gonna take EVERY family US losing someone someone get REALLY sick public sentiment shifts. It‚Äôs going long fall/winter. america people make something simple wearing mask virus outbreak, even prevent disease....a ""freedom"" issue. us, obvs. But, 6% deaths COVID! /s Sure, quote installed Trump lackey disputing integrity article's reporting audit. Michael Caputo remains reliable truth teller wet piece toilet paper. Point remains. Stop trying link everything muh racism. Racism fatigue getting pretty high. Anti-maskers stupid, nothing racism. anything, falling CCP propaganda pushing anti-mask message make sure US damaged this. DING Think Dr.Fauci said schools opening mentions ‚Äúopening windows‚Äù ventilation. Well happens it‚Äôs extremely cold? People shut windows closes air ventilation trapping virus. 



People stay indoors often outside less. Plus viruses like Covid tend spread quicker winter it‚Äôs ideal weather virus naturally. Less UV light lives better cold. That's likely, although catastrophe economy.
I see lot people bought houses countryside summer moved cities, Lockdown land around seems favorable. Normalcy bias clarify, babies 6 months absolutely get injections. possible cannot get specific injection flu shot. many cases now? Okay I‚Äôd rather die exist like Learned mistake? realize they'd implementing lockdowns anytime soon. Please enlighten regards correction mistake speak of. Lockdown fatigue already leading many new cases. Premier Ontario, Doug Ford going crazy trying get people stop gathering large groups. Apparently we‚Äôre going seeing new fines absolutely colossal. need job I‚Äôm hiring Mid 2022 bet. Civil unrest big local outbreaks. Agreed. Nothing left Amazon Netflix us. Covid cases falling, death rate developed world settled around 2%

Where getting 2% CFR number from? stable outbreaks, I'm seeing 1% (e.g Sweden, NY, NJ, Germany).

For quickly growing outbreaks need delay cases deaths (deaths today relative cases 3-4 weeks ago).. seems less 1% (e.g Spain).. Exactly. Look Figure 2 report see numbers explode week 23 on. That‚Äôs started testing kids need hospital care.  


In week 24 Swedens find around 400 kids corona. Finland less 20.  


It‚Äôs bizarre Swedish authorities conclude difference data clearly shows is. I'm one making conspiratorial claims future. That's you, gullible fool. I'm primarily talking developing world. Maybe care brown people. Oof. Bad experience? places lot people? Sure. cases trending general reason, reason people get it, harder spread virus. Vaccines gonna increase effect, (two months) far away lots people getting said vaccines. wish would report 7-day averages. bit data smoothing solves fluctuation stops stupid headlines. goal eradicate virus get manageable levels like we‚Äôve done viruses? make mask wearing thing rest lives things like flu, never cared about, eradicated too? What‚Äôs thoughts?  they‚Äôll take market share left 60% businesses gone under.  know that's reactionaries like imagine ""other"", truth. life remarkably good compared most. But, yes, get upset corruption, incompetence, dishonesty, can't stand Trump administration. wait couple years accurate analysis pandemic Pakistan. hope numbers turn good reported, time tell truth. 

They certainly done vastly better United States adjust economic differences. getting 2ish months 

That's insanely optimistic. Cases still trending upward, especially Midwest. California redirected 5% existing government employees contact tracing. Also heard program shitshow disorganized. ridiculous goal eliminate traffic deaths completely, traffic accidents somehow contagious, yes I'd say seatbelts suffice comparison total abstinence.

How say straight face we're middle pandemic warrants national mask mandate, going casino, nail salon, bar, even fucking vacation Las Vegas okay long wear mask? would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty Safety. ~ Ben Franklin.  lay surgical mask top n95. heard helps extend usage time point remains, though. Lockdowns utility comes avoiding hospitals getting overrun, beyond that...you're kicking road. Now, vaccine maybe two months away (at least US), make argument there's light end tunnel worth kicking road. that's ***now***. May June? sure was.   optimist. We'll correct error. ; ) Wow argument better ways make virus.

That's kinda sus lmao wrote two replies post three hours ago. One Russia &amp; China worse one asking source. edit anything. replied two hours ago. (You also posted two times right now). see problem that. 


If link source Sweden worse lag countries, I'm interested. manipulate data violates public trust

Do know ironic sentence ? Especially light Trump entire GOP manipulated data started biggest crisis US history lies fake news.

Democracy gold standard. Democracies around world known fucking manipulate data violate public trust.

Also India close failed democracy. called ""democracy"" nothing sham, religiously charged mob rule benefits loud majority oppresses else. Like [Indian government tried shift blame Covid onto Muslims resulted violent ""race war"" maybe thinking sarcastic. Sweden's low numbers cases per tests Norway, Finland, Denmark, Germany. Inconvenient who? They've learned mistake, shooting feet like Spain France. I'm 5 months recovered improvement since last follow 2 weeks ago. Maybe technically can't say long term yet, like outlook right now.  let's stay inside another 4 months wait Winter, yeah? lol - hope wounds heal someday. Layering defenses increases overall efficiency. 
0.5 vs 0.5 x 0.5 Damn vaccines suck sounds like still allow face shields though, right. get everything know COVID fear mongering politicians news aggregators probably would feel differently.

I personally know probably dozen people COVID. Know felt recovering? Like shut fucking country nothing. know bartender COVID, worst part shut bar two weeks recovering. One coworkers described he, ""Had pallet bricks sitting [his] chest."" Last week talking much hates mask mandates. know obese nurse hospitalized COVID. Released 2 days later. know anyone died COVID, that's due sheer luck. That's due fact 99.96% state's population died COVID.

Here's food thought. Simply existing Australia comes 0.7% per year chance dying. Sweden's 6000 COVID deaths represents 0.06% population.

We be. federal government clearly want to... hyperbolic. condoning poor treatment Muslims India, comparison inaccurate. countries worse US right terms COVID? 

Serious question. ""We reduce hospital usage"" ""Hospital usage go back again"" contradictory. latter logically follows former.

It's shame fallen propaganda. Pressure drop measurement much pressure lose air flows filter. AKA, high pressure drops make harder breathe.  moreover Vietnamese socialism means government mobilize country way prioritizes lives profits. possible America. Italien tested quite twice less growth death toll. Good luck America brilliant. close feel probably happened Wow. took like 5 attempts. think ever post actual link.

But ""debunk"" anything said. never brought 6% / 9,000 figure CDC. Even problem number I've watching [CDC since pandemic began number **""Deaths involving Covid19 pneumonia, excluding influenza""** 81k. know 6% comes meaning (haven't looked yet). 

It funny unknown anonymous source claim something 25+ people refute considered irrefutable evidence President said considered conspiracy theory. find selective terminology usage... odd? imagine it, happened ... Though herpes probably best comparison make, point still stands. Quite lot people US think years basically forever, much personal sacrifice make health others much less themselves. There's much one convince otherwise. obese type immune issue risk minimal. Metaphor. native speaker? Firstly, deaths among old people ways judge society, secondly they're clearly falling last pretty quickly. Thirdly know whether pandemic nearly them. seems come Cells people still try &amp; say 70% population needs antibodies. possible 100s cases there's human human transmission? Isnt impossible?

As pretty much everything relating pandemic is, course measured number cases. number cases.

Whether Sweden handled pandemic well nothing validity relevance report. projecting. Anyone likes peeps candy corn really hates themselves. really. Trump 5 kids likely would dozens abortion illegal. Seems like generation getting quite bit dumber. see bunches high risk people public refusing wear masks. go little possible.

They want locked sweet work home jobs see anyone, even without pandemic! Noones telling lockdown, care everyone else does?

As president calling hoax, people died New York. hardly surprising Gates would shocked. He's smart person believes things smart way. case would bring every possible resource country bear protecting people stopping spread, encouraging people trust, sacrifice, take care one another.

This paragraph really stood me. First all, proper distribution doubtful? evidence support that? developed nations proper infrastructure functioning bureaucracy, like USA, it‚Äôs certainly possible likely. Second all, says many people take vaccine. That‚Äôs true, many? need provide sort number, can‚Äôt pull shit thin air. third point, yes, healthcare poorly prioritized decades there‚Äôs financial incentive so. financial incentive get vaccine quickly efficiently possible you‚Äôre ignorant think otherwise.

This astonishingly terrible article. Another pile shit cesspool NYT opinion page  depends still money eat out. number people likely get vaccine surprising recommending this.

no doesnt. even biden wins wont able anything national lockdown (again) deemed unconstitutional, [as per pennsylvania's recent court decision sets supposed preventing hospitals overloaded. 

except true. lockdown always intended multiple things. also supposed give time ramp production PPE (still widely available/affordable), give time researches better understand new virus, does, spreads (good progress there, still lot unanswered questions), give time doctors develop protocols treatments (which already helped lower deaths shorten time ICUs considerably), allow time keep infections low enough establish contact tracing (half-assed late US), allow time roll establish widespread testing (which also botched), etc. 

Never point prevent hospitals overrun. Protecting lives limiting spread virus always part plan.

This quote comes mind however.

America came together *against brown people Muslims*, I'm getting sick subreddit pretending America big happy family 9/11. Trump's defence, Trump still president, worst case scenario. knew *anything* China, knew exporting political model (""socialism *Chinese* characteristics"") last thing want. care.

Unlike, know, democracies sometimes export ""values"" force, invasion bombs, disastrous results. Try project idiocies China.

This could stayed 150K. actually not, dont eat. less work. dont shop cook agree, many xyz making 10 million doses type news, news title says vaccine distribution begins xyz take months seems life like undeveloping country. mean, 2/8000 still means million people affected giving vaccine 4 billion people (or 2 billion twice etc). sir, far human good done times immediate family. sit outside feet away other, wear KN95 masks eating. use utensils serve touching silverware. same, fine. 

We even played boardgame way day. 

I say works us also extremely careful exposure ways. Get involved local politics. much there. want better environmental policies fight city bike friendly better public transit. change lot way. Remember Elon Musk said close zero new cases end April? Ooo another classic, NOVEL virus therefore must throw existing knowledge. damage reported things like myocarditis NOVEL, well known complication viral infections. also know majority cases induced viral infection typically resolves without additional medical intervention.

Similar things like shortness breath getting tired easily well known complications pneumonia COVID cause. know generally resolves time.

Or best people cite complications ICU patients ignore side effects ventilator; shocking many people seem understand made ICU long road recovery, basically deaths door.

So COVID novel, effects conditions understand. Yet people like hear word novel lose minds act like first ever encounter virus. Hey go bad mouthing wall.

Just wait see. wall going stop even corona getting we'll glad wall wall goodness.

Yeah well restrictions place, remember lockdown forbade even resting park benches minutes earlier year? school closures? total closing non-essential shops almost everything else? lucky hit later Italy Spain, able prepare worst following initial lockdown.  get functioning vaccine first tell us many going make? even know many make vaccine might need manufactured differently?

No. That‚Äôs point. Philly resident happy we‚Äôre holding steady city recreating 1918 right now, blow. they‚Äôre going continue move chain, hopefully someone sense uphold it.  No, covid. cases

I'm lucky anyone immediate circle spouts conspiracy theories, know would manage remain civil. sympathy. Ok bother looking precise population China. fucking big, point. Even though case rising again, seriously reduced lockdown. wear mask outside supposed see given number friends/relative. restaurant/bar/sport club open again. restriction (Like changing clother gym keep distance) back 80 percent normal life. 

Even though contact person, start miss real physical contact stranger got lockdown. odds likely virus transferred animals humans way MERS SARS 1 did? think adding extra step likely? 50/50 chance local Walmart Florida. gonna everywhere though.

&amp;#x200B;

And often even shelves half empty couple options brands. No, anti-maskers rated something else. probably depends type face mask, whether worn fitted correctly, effectiveness vaccine. 

Some initial vaccines might 50% effective -- meaning reduce probability getting infected 50%. 

Some better quality masks, 95% effective, higher.  

So, probably right -- good masks may effective vaccines. trying argumentative, understanding.

Why sure rise due testing? Nah, I‚Äôm good. fine WA. Yeah guess context important here. Obviously taking mask sitting next someone biggest bs ever.

However feel like masks mandatory/expected outside (like countries), inside, talking someone directly outside, *really* crowded Proper social distancing hygiene dropped cases almost 0 plenty countries. even almost 100% mask adherence achieves that, yet somehow effective measure now? I'm talking pivot Gates. Grasping straws. u want shop place 100% mask adherence, visit chinatown able trust medical authorities tell us worldwide pandemic

you be, problem scientists discovered wield lot social power quite happy use it. 

it would trivial scientist lay science, ""data"" make clear transition normative statement opinion based data. would carry lot intrinsic credibility since opinion formed synthesis expert's total knowledge along particular data set. 

but lot easier make authoritarian power grab conflate two get feeling disagree measures, yet Canada wishing Gov this. 

They're not, result cases spiking economy imploding. 

What would give 12 weeks hard measures real enforcement finally feel safe enough go god damn restaurant visit 2 friends time. one believes true. look study, pretty significant limitations. Patient baseline characteristics quite different, didnt include BMI risk factor, even baseline Vit level. glaring thing missing safety data, kind side effects patients possibly have?

I say deserve studied further, small, flawed study enough say treatment widely adopted. Definitely needs larger study better designed that's ""cough"" ask ""are sure?"" I'll probably wearing mask still, mentally getting March/April left hunkering down.

The mask wearing probably (hopefully) thing EVERYONE time get cold/flu. nuts ever before. put correction doubled importance actually wearing one initial blunder. can't read entire article, many figures hand. - headline undeniable. NZ biggest ever fall GDP. can't wave away. thought ""lock hard early"" would better results that, good idea. far tell, GDP UK yet fallen 2008 crash, idiots supposedly locked late. One reason would odds, anyone find bat carrying virus yet? risk youre distanced others whole time. Wash hands afterward. know would get us back normal? Everyone properly wearing fucking masks. alone would huge change. Many people already gone back normal least semi-normal. 2 ways pandemic ends. One medical ending kills everyone like [Justinian develop vaccine protect people. medical ending mean gone forever. second way social ending accept go lives. say social ending start medical ending. that's many countries already doing.

The Infographics Show great video [How Pandemics he's either liar incompetent. Hey, look- propaganda circlejerk. much. hand there's significant proof SARS-nCov-2 indeed GoF virus. 262 currently hospitalized... 0.0003% population. I'm forcing dichotomy? Alright man, good one. I'm hoping become little less blinded mistakes made positions power, especially mistakes kill people. world (and particular, comparable US) seen country stop widespread locking down? wrong. Masks work. way really think we're worse France Spain? mandated masks, fuck still close cities. You, are, wrong. think 1% infection rate he‚Äôs referring % tests positive. 

I don‚Äôt know that‚Äôs statistic you‚Äôre using, looks like might using % total population, would apples oranges. 

Edit: Andrew M. Cuomo today announced New York State's COVID-19 infection rate 1 percent 38 straight days. Yesterday, 0.92 test results reported New York State 195,545 people tested GGD test lanes past week, compared 180,182 people week before. national level, percentage positive tests increased week, rising 2.8% previous week 3.9% week. reproduction number risen 1.38. means 100 people infected novel coronavirus collectively infect another 138 people. Americans. Chinese rest Asia wore masks January. Coincidentally many countries problem WhatsApp owned Facebook Inc. 

At least WhatsApp know company control propagation lie, Facebook sure. lockdown pretty much over. companies coming back?

EDIT: oh, wait, you. nevermind then. personally think moral culpability associated spreading virus (short belligerent intention, like coughing directly someone's face). Viral spread part nature. 

Obviously wash hands go bathroom, lose sleep running daily interactions wondering personally passed endemic disease someone life. open link, you?

Then CDC [definition correct. Early pandemic (Around Feb), subsequently CDC put narrative masks worn people sick (with symptoms) health care professionals.

Furthermore, (and Dr. Fauci included) stated civilians possess sufficient mask don/doff discipline expertise use mask effectively. said masks would ineffective general population people going touch masks, inconsistent remove masks. idea general population using masks widely discouraged discounted ineffectual step preventing spread virus. Oof. brutal. I‚Äôve Definitely seen video folks saying gov wants us like Muslims cover faces Stop spreading misinformation! sound like one people who'd ditch masks second take vaccine. Every decent professional, Fauci NYT Redfield, agreed even vaccine out, still need require social distancing mask-wearing *least* one year!

It‚Äôs good take Vit even better get sunshine (morale boost too!) need remember hospital given IV. top - problem HUGELY uneducated group 'manufacturers' type manufacturing actually need (Biotech one example) - specialized/educated people. They're slowly culling older people years experience - problem people know 'how way' understand 'why' they're it. think US per capita death toll higher Sweden Whenever would look number total cases compare number total deaths, 4-5%. It‚Äôs dropped though.

ATM see 6.6 Million cases, 196k deaths.
So it‚Äôs 3%

Considering lot don‚Äôt know (can contract once? increase decrease survival chance?) Im using what‚Äôs available.

We also know deaths attributed things. people also asymptomatic. Others still catch don‚Äôt get tested ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want inflate numbers.‚Äù many variables.

We‚Äôll never actually know true rate year now. It‚Äôs unknown.

So removing unknown factor, Im left know. current number total cases deaths. assumption largest variance going people catch without symptoms (mainly kids).

I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs 3%. Hopefully I‚Äôm wrong drops 1% time. 

But even 0.5% 1.5 million deaths.... always told masks extremely vital protecting virus.

We not. Early messaging masks necessary general public, may even harmful worn incorrectly wearing mask all. remember distinctly disagreed strongly time. still see anything article Bill Gates quotes.

Where science justifying masks? studies? data? could people imbecile? Well logic, yes, see say barely anyone wearing mask time. I'm careful, still hang homes 2-3 people without masks. long fucking time ago. published detailing wrong redaction.  Yep. 

I think happened...  

Virus exists, gets US.

Trump Republicans knew gonna bad would hurt economy, Trump's entire selling point. 

So made gamble... Downplay virus, push reopening appear tough, strong like covid big deal. Maybe economy hit bad many people die? What's worst happen?

This attitude filters right wing population. 

6 months later, 100k+ lives could've saved. 

They lost bet. help national leaders call hoax discourage masks well. thought CDC lied americans masks. real conspiracy maybe virus originate China. There's Economist article SE Asia possibility, especially Vietnam. weren‚Äôt NDAs involved. Easy handle? beg differ, think share sentiment alone.

btw, answer main question:

I'm asking need see convince [how many lives saved lockdowns]. give links scientific estimates it. mean accept likely true? exactly need see studies convince you? claim $250 worth taxes! (usually that's drop bucket). Many teachers complain love job students. mentioned German Nazi party Hitler specific individual. paying attention all? Never said that. need follow medical scientific professionals guidelines. decide you‚Äôre done you‚Äôre going back normal. Okay Fauci said secure masks health professionals first due decimated supply refusal acquire PPE current administration? logic checkout? makes sense considering immediate hoarding saw supplies.

Not government (US) went us favors way allowed organizations middle man distribution sake profit random handouts shady people.   Poorly written propaganda, full speculation ‚Äúmay‚Äù ‚Äúmight‚Äù.

That 3.9 billion people. Let's divide number months May 2021 November 2020, would roughly 6 months, including November excluding may.

That means pharma's would produce distribute 650M units per month hit mark.

Obviously, production going immediately number grow production becomes efficient, point is, vaccine ready, made. making many going easy challenge. Pharma's committing to, effectively, end 2021 meet current orders, roughly 2.0B doses. (http://nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02450-x).

Yeah! could 170,000 dead instead 200,000.

Sorry man, need get new talking points. maybe learn math? Except see corresponding rise deaths attributed pneumonia diseases make sense unless COVID reported right. Medical experts believe actual death toll higher is. leftist actual medical professionals.

Little evidence exists effectively wearing mask well individuals prevent becoming mask use well individuals, combination protective measures, might beneficial certain situations (e.g., high-risk individuals must crowded settings well parents caring ill children home).

For masks effective, individuals must wear consistently correctly; actions challenging. Masks must worn once, never shared always changed soiled wet. used properly, masks may lead greater risk pandemic influenza transmission contamination, may make user overconfident hence neglectful personal protective measures, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette self-isolation measures deemed important complementary actions use masks reduction disease given masks cannot used eating drinking may make communication difficult, wearing prolonged periods may impractical ineffective. important present limitations mask use proper disposal used masks accompany recommendations use community setting.

The blame largely kids, know virus do, break school rules anyway. virus exists that's fact need respect. get behave irresponsibly blame others. still shit show. suggest healthcare workers wear cloth masks √±ast resort ran PPE? thought cloth mask better mask except general public case cloth masks magically became useless dangerous. going Kennedy School case study years come.

Worst public health policy blunder modern times. Trump, Fauci, Adams, CDC actors case. Yes 100%

Even hardcore, pro-restrictions people don‚Äôt expect last literally forever, I‚Äôm sure mean entitled attitude. supposed pay partying spree? parents? student loans?

New York got hit hard early know much virus worked. 

What excuse States rdealing surging cases deaths today? Fucking thank you, swear god people fast turn basic critical thinking see headline think supports preconceived notions CDC guideline: **Don‚Äôt** put mask around neck thumbnail, Fauci demonstrates safely wear mask.

It's proper talk ""right"" something choose do. general matter, viral propagation part human condition social contract. moral failing. countries still caught deaths, vindication? epidemic Sweden yet, either. still disagree vs endorsing makeshift masks modest protection, understand it.

so, claim 90% discharged COVID patients suffer new chronic health problems ""well documented."" fact, article even mention chronic health problems, instead ""persistent symptoms."" wildly editorialized whole thing reason. ebola would scare fuck Americans. virus see effects versus one flu like symptoms 1-2% people die from.

That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs GOP boils days. pisses libs cares thousands even hundreds thousands die. Take libs.  Confirmed deaths, cases, no.

COVID-19 deaths significantly higher well, way people die expected average CDC confirmed. underreported. reason H1N1 didn‚Äôt require massive shutdowns, killed tiny fraction people compared COVID-19. course competent administration back actually listened science.

Hint: viruses don‚Äôt ‚Äúmagically go away like miracle‚Äù. He's /mostly/ dead guy know saying hospitals paid Covid deaths types deaths. Apparently government (Dems?) . dude literally jumping fucking hoops defend point Covid worse Influenza. stated friend nurse tell insider information. stopped arguing blankly stared wall while. Yes, completely possible IgM antibodies 4 months. SARS 1 third patients still elevated IgM 90 days. Whether lack IgG means body still fighting virus somewhere deep inside known. IgG typically provides long term immune response enough time know means disease yet. kill everyone now. death rate next year astronomically low People dumb republican. Democrats exist, everything would perfect time? know. like half population gone insane, mean literally insane. think implication everything COVID-19 Democratic hoax, therefore Democrats lose election, bother maintaining hoax anymore point. scientist fled Hong Kong currently living undisclosed secret location, said proof back theory report published soon. 

In video clip, says ""the genome sequence like human fingerprint based recognise identify thing."" ""So used evidence based genome sequence tell people come lab China, ones made it."" 

The scientist said sure discovered anyone else ""verify"" themselves. ""And also anyone even biology knowledge read check verify it."" scientist claims origins Corona virus outbreak researchers saying. 

Meanwhile, Cambridge University researchers, examining breadcrumb trail genetic material, said seems like coronavirus originated southern China Wuhan.

People village areas southern China habitually come contact bats researchers found 3% people antibodies indicates infected would swore bet $500 sort spinal tap parody...wth yet right wing billionaires continue use billions stunt humanity's progress every turn, enrichment. 

So what's excuse awful?  Translation:

We squeeze fewer employees realized. First dibs gone businesses closed governors states. hoax gone 15 days. also Trump personally saved us 10 million dead. can't even. you‚Äôre embarrassed don‚Äôt leave?

Behavior driven lots complicated factors. unified plan pandemic US lots people charge large institutions make life death decisions students pawns failed throw arms say fuck let‚Äôs go bowling Yeah, figured that. Though believe recent estimates closer 5 typical viral load.

My point simply that, eventually, nuance added policies. Can't go way indefinitely, covid going anywhere fast. example, wife travelling direct Massachusetts (by car). place which, per capita, fewer daily cases Ontario. less chance catching here. filled travel form enter state tested ways. jazz. itinerary verifiable - policy allow sort nuance.

Another question would take achieve 50% population immunity, given currently know long naturally acquired immunity SARS-CoV-2 lasts (immunity seasonal coronaviruses usually relatively short lived), particularly among mild forms disease, whether might take several rounds re-infection robust immunity attained. Re-infection conclusively documented limited number cases far unclear whether rare phenomenon may prove become common occurrence. Likewise, previous infection would affect course disease re-infection, whether level pre-existing immunity would affect viral shedding transmissibility, unknown.

Am one tinks article insane?

Except herd immunity folks zero interest science. merely opportunity racism trunp doesn‚Äôt anything massive pile bodies he‚Äôs created.  Ah well, sound that's why. bad. See yall next year fam United stand; divided fall. Ahhh... therein lies problem friend. 

Common sense uncommon days critical thinking left building well.  napkin math said 2 mil dead minimum US we're still line based percentage dead vs infected. That's effective vaccine treatment, get spread control. 10 million entirely, tragically, reasonable number dead Americans persists.  feel like Italy bit 100 thousand coronavirus tests per day, could also 100 thousand vaccines per day, imagine Germans efficient are. love partner. battled cancer. tough.

""They scary children"", adults dont dress up, anyone older like 8 going trickrtreating *at night*, *before 7pm* seen like hooligan like somehow taking away night kids. Despite one pranks all.

Like took kids night, would plenty time dress school...or wear costumes school. also wouldnt feel like trashy adults ""taking"" halloween kids adults adult Halloween weekend before. costumes branded approved list movies. 

Anyways point is, one treats Halloween respect fear deserves. Parents dont face fears children, dont let children face fears, results masks scary masks common decline. Denial religion, real things fear come instead embracing wearing mask ""to pass demon spirit"" plague, curse, passes by, reject deny. traditions place.  

(I epiphany cultural traditions. Theres mask human wears blend yokai spirit festival, masks pagans/Christian's wear Halloween disguise demons spirits night dead/spirits closer, theres similar dynamic Moses putting blood lamb doorway smite spirit passes by, indicating follower christian God. dont really see lot people discussing masks protect group people, individual) it. moisture spray eliminate electrostatic qualities. good live hope people swing states show vote.

But 1918, estimated 650,000 us folks died spanish flu. yes, Covid bad, no, thus far *not* bad worst flu season ever, much less 3-4 times bad. Better cautious one. Nice job snow bro‚Äôs Also hasn‚Äôt full year run. starting point 1. flu season starts thousands tens thousands. It‚Äôs comparison next year. India currently reporting 1,200 deaths per day.

Oh, I've got it, Spanish Cold! got nice ring it! Unless people test positive, go anyways, put behind people. friend mine Fake News &amp; Conspiracy Bullshit train since start this.

During one last big arguments this, kind blew shit off; tough recognize much respected sense logic past, he's demonstrated countless times arrive conclusion sound reasoning. I've accept well-reasoned argument break delusions.

I remember relented let topic go one final comment: ""You wait September. see. wait September.""

I'm Texan, born raised. Every conversation like fucking heartbreaking. many people respect care utterly failing think shit through. hard grow realize vast majority community know fuck talking about. good article would also made historical research large airlift campaigns, like Berlin Airlift. whole reason half country acting like morons virus refusing wear mask even acknowledge severity. gone way multiple occasions call hoax, overblown, fault democrats, whatever.  screams science wrong need re-open 'liberate' democrat-run states, fueling flames anyone disagrees automatically wrong.

Where say mandate mask law? simply said wear one making public appearances. legislation would form paying people stay home suspending rent/mortgage/credit card payments people spreading disease.

Empathy would go long way giving people hope letting people know someone actually cares trying get us this, rather completely ignored favor focusing far less important issues cancel culture.

Keep making reddit great edgelord comment history though.  One horrifying things 2020 still offer Americans election less 2 months. glad I'm Canadian given shitshow United States I'm probably going safe even Trump gets re-elected. Half lost fighting world war...

We men sent beaches D-DAY little boys can't wear mask. Absurd. nothing else maybe could compassion children, since can't put anyone else's shoes. wild look timeline see Trump‚Äôs mention transcript. literally forgotten was. cannot believe impeachment year too! Fuck 2020 sucks! No, 1/10th like 1.2k deaths day. mean wrong sense Canada major trading partner US wall necessarily affect that. fuck putting bodies?!?! Pretty much. Yes, are. something happens country take us bit, think we'll see many sad faces imagine. care about? right? 

Empirical evidence knowing objective truth thing holding society together. trying destroy that. rate growth last 50k slow declining quickly. rate change real news story, since it‚Äôs predictive insightful rather reactionary nature. Anyone could‚Äôve looked models told we‚Äôd hit 200k around time weeks ago. I'm Indonesia people(usually lower income people) help dig graves families neighbors even middle class people considered cruel unusual feel like manual labor Unofficially, many excess deaths? holding Pillow guy, get medical information him!

Smother MyPillow It‚Äôs , updated since hit 200,000 American lives . called 250k around may think, wrong. think going 500k done second reply. News station. No. Idk went college, college, workers campus students.

The majority workers aware of, maybe, bet truly majority -- they're professors. Janitors, security guards, physical plant maintenance (plumbers, electricians, HVAC techs), librarians, cafeteria cooks, doctors nurses student health center, people handle parking, core staff, core business staff (the registrar bursar, program managers, accountants), people manage student employees generally students. people keep place running invisible students. also way people professors.

Larger schools may things like non-teaching research faculty, actual police department, intercollegiate sports coaches, ""development"" staff (people fundraising marketing), people run museums campus. also going mostly non-students.

(Source: used support staff university know people work community colleges. colleagues ages late 20s early 70s. (and still do) major health issues (including ones would put higher risk COVID), turns college *usually* pretty good place work health problem disability.) trying find numbers height AIDS crisis (to make comparison age group) , bad, didn‚Äôt seem reach year. That's college town Back February estimate 1 million dead. shocked.  Wooo yeah team! I'm failing see insulted you.

I take next time flu, going go business mere link infection chain kills someone, well... guess that's brakes, huh? 

That's appears I'm standing. 

I pointed flu kills people still go flu spread around think nothing it. told false equivalence (paraphrasing that) proceeded list reasons (which means guess risk worth it?). know better, I'd say selfish. thought one death many? Probably secret teams democratic assassins make president look bad /s doubt access article, Neil Fergusson, Imperial College predicted:

136,000 deaths mad cow disease
200 million dead bird flu

No doubt 'do nothing' predictions, extensive actions took prevented this? recap""

Mad cow deaths: 178
Bird Flu deaths: 455

I'm suggesting Sar-cov-2 serious, asinine suggest model accurate Sweden done nothing. Yet public keep morons power... Smh head. sadness tonight overwhelming. thing surpassing sadness utter frustration knowing number potential double months now, there's little (at late point) stop it. I'm unutterably weary stating truth last seven months dismissed pessimist. RIP, fellow Americans. feedback duped Trump Woodward tapes? No, citizen now. 

So part incorrect? tell.  We're number 1! We're number 1!

Downplaying word. either know risks life ruined know lobby direction. I‚Äôll tell didn‚Äôt sleep quarantine. BLM rioters haha Deleted mods 3, 2 ... ""American Council Science Health"" sounds like know they're talking about. technical aspects go beyond scope article

and whole article handwaving. Later. least 2022. article garbage. study control group.  Yes. hospitals overwhelmed, 100% support living life normal. original goal prevent excess deaths exceeding hospital capacity. We've succeeded that, states like Georgia South Dakota succeeded goal without lockdowns. 

It may hard remember gaslighting goes subreddit, point pandemic accepted deaths gonna happen prevented. That's going it. Trust me... Pretty sure attempted murder

It sure feels like it. purposely hid sister, super cautious COVID exposure son autoimmune disorder. aunt chemotherapeutics, dad respiratory disease. mean, attempted murder, admire ability kill 3 birds one stone...  like dream come true. Americans allowed country. Thank God! actually happening. awesome. seriously happening. Germany extremely tracing program? That's definitely something America have. Trumps advisor said two million deaths. Pretty soon Bezos entire country. small businesses go way dodo. blame 90% deaths WHO? Guess Trump right idea ditch them.    prophecy true scheduled trip knowing cousin COVID+, I've told. whatever wants expose herself, father, sister, aunt deserve exposed selfish.  Yeah help old billy boy saying start this. need save save mask front line workers. didnt say copy japan, hong kong, doing? would become like pre-vaccine chicken pox years. illness adults would dangerous rare, people would contracted young. Another person unable read understand, mean like Australia, UK, France? I've heard restaurants Melbourne booming right now. 200,000 high death rates beginning. seems unreasonable expect additional 300,000 deaths next 12 months.

Edit: wish knew downvoting could RemindMe! 365 days sadly lot people know better, complying want to, whatever reason. shit? Covid 10k Yeah, countries aren‚Äôt stupid shutdown hard fast businesses open again. Freedumb country everything fucked lack reaction pandemic. conspiracy theory particularly tempting several reasons. First, China secretive, authoritarian country, really much surprise government bioweapons program. Second, China suppressed research origins coronavirus. Third, SARS-CoV-2 really weird respiratory virus, since ability spread throughout body damage organs. Combined, many people see circumstantial evidence make true. Either coronavirus naturally worked way human population or, Chinese laboratory really involved, virus probably studied researchers accidentally infected one them. (This would explain China wants cover origin virus; escaped lab, Chinese scientists would look incompetent.) simply insufficient reason believe malicious forces play. extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence, ""man-made virus"" theory fails test. Yea personally wouldn‚Äôt. Plus n95 *fabric* polypropylene think fabric like it‚Äôs even fickle finicky say cloth mask especially chemicals used. think **** hydrogen peroxide vapor?) might best way it‚Äôs something private citizens aware of. Imagine killing entire industry telling yourself, ""It's dumb industry anyway,"" wash hands guilt people lose livelihoods. talk average 1,000 deaths per day, take another 800 days 2 years reach 1MM dead U.S. 

Let‚Äôs hope vaccines anti-viral treatments kick don‚Äôt get 1MM.  maybe herd immunity idea might start seen well. 

Not sure make another two years current environment.   psychological principle financially invested something prevent seeing reality. Scientology lot scams successful.

I ran business basically rented space small parties (legal open right now) didn‚Äôt see could buy use industrial fogger groups also ventilating room enough expose people chemicals. could disinfect every NIGHT need one group per day weekends, won‚Äôt work Saturday.. especially it‚Äôs air needs cleaned most.. looking air purifiers? good ones make TON noise. things cost money.

So there‚Äôs tremendous psychological incentive think clean ‚Äúhigh tough surfaces‚Äù fine. know that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôd feel real bad someone got infected bathroom. I‚Äôd clean bathroom several times day? don‚Äôt want that...

So yeah took L. actually business training sunk cost fallacy drilled head professors - sunk money doesn‚Äôt exist anymore shouldn‚Äôt factored decisions. know, pointing ridiculous comment was. talking about? That's quite literally ARDS works regardless pathogen... hell go medical school? school needs decertified *immediately*. Shhh... need another scapegoat. Remember guy called ""DEMOCRAT HOAX"" *months* tweet history proves statement fact. Yeah normal circumstances. global pandemic. situation own. completely new disease still know everything about. also know great treatments vaccine against. know people contagious asymptomatic. 

Listen try convince harming anybody want. like people wedding did. going put life hold etc etc. Yet are, five people dead later. normal times. **r/Conservative disliked that** I‚Äôm sorry, aren‚Äôt numbers true indication severity COVID? deaths contributing underlying factors. 

What‚Äôs # deaths people totally healthy one day - COVID - they‚Äôre dead? Didn‚Äôt see like 9% ‚ÄúCOVID deaths‚Äù actually attributable COVID only? studies linking diabetes covid? Tankies, yes, usually writing iphones sipping latte.

It understood ""doctors"" also Trojan horses import communist ideology anything, although medical care important component service provide, means ideological end.

From local government/population point view, mediocre medical care better status quo: medical care whatsoever. usual narrative/context, whether medical care provide modern standards whether ""doctors"" modern-day slaves, everybody's minds. conspiracy never end, mark word, lol Youre absolutely right, looking certain studies support position. problem is, surgical masks N95 masks designed two different purposes. expert field well aware differences. course surgical masks prevent infections wearer, never designed it. medical protocal protective gear infectious disease situations involve surgical masks primary kit - medical advisors know this.

But used studies support idea masks general arent helpful feared running protective gear first responders. 

I understand did, still disagree best tactic use. theyve lost trust. Yes? Fauci walked pass trail mask nose. told cover dick nose. country make masks compulsory together without form lockdown?

I really see point argument. see situation better stay, see weird improvement caused virus loosing power. Everything else simply know, read stuff also practically difference attitudes towards unknown danger. Oh, bad. Mildly uncomfortable sneezed bit, matter since car drive thru test. Could looked Asia things managed much pandemic experience exceptionalism got way. bad masks can't made simple household supplies.....oh wait ü§ê 'bout CDC statistics everyone ignoring? Treasure deep breaths. Sure. 1987-1997. programs another 30 years fraud detection methods awareness along with, said comment below, one watched scrutinized events history. top that, Scott wasn‚Äôt pre-emptively accused fraud 40% voting population start operation probably wasn‚Äôt expecting feds come knocking like every single hospital country today. Comments section: ‚ÄúCovid Trump‚Äôs fault‚Äù Sorry burst ya'lls bubble state gone back normal awhile now. Everywhere two big cities state worn masks 2 months well. urban populations ones care anymore. think bars restaurants lose business dystopian mask mandates social distancing guidelines?

My state indoor dining since June. I've gone like 3 times same. I'm person feels way. go bar allowed leave seat throw barbecue house stupid rules?  Ah, numbers faked, see /s  well, claim 90% accuracy. lets say +/-10% pcr test trials. Dont know much human condition, eh? Sadly longer term tell. countries really locked far greater economic destructio, worth 5 years down-the-line?

 6 months pandemic death rate per capita Italy basically United States right now. Sure buddy, done overthrowing evil governements waking sheeple guy fawkes mask, we'll finger painting play doh. 

No need answer nothing say, gave real example victimless crime cringy speech It‚Äôll take kill NYC.

Local stores areas around seeing massive bump now. huge drive eat shop locally. 

Since started dump corner cleaned park bbq area. 

The local restaurants (in fairness ones survived shutdown) thriving people don‚Äôt travel areas.

The bakery nearby putting planning permission convert bar night. Bake downstairs day, remain cafe afternoon, turn around place open bar evening also sells pastry.  Lotta car crashes happening then, considering thats 6 times number people dying normal years. would eliminate jobs ...  would opening quickly haphazardly. end shutting again, why. ‚Äú...cancellation tons medical procedures make way surge coronavirus hospitalizations never came...‚Äù

You lost credibility may right there. work healthcare surge hospitalizations, many parts county. Dismissing facts doesn‚Äôt make less true. [Daily reminder subreddit supported ""two weeks flatten curve"" back plan never eliminate virus. plan always avoid overwhelming hospitals, clearly without locking down. Powerful-hungry governments fabricated goal elimination, seeing ""success"" Australia, New Zealand, Europe, people latched onto idea. 6 months later Melbourne police state, New Zealand second lockdown, cases rise across Europe. Elimination **not** sustainable strategy. Learn live virus quit fear mongering bullshit. know, least could done situation notifying authority 2 people coming back Da Nang. telling people notify know coming back months.

The procedure public hospitals medical centers testing people symptoms alone without travel history active July beginning September. sell people see online went private hospitals clinics FV hospitals Vinmec system HCMC. highly suspect expats didnt go certified testing facilities. Ditto fronts COVID. Care elaborate? Academic makes provocative statement completely odds reality. News 11. small business owners done rate. Good lord pearl clutching freaks insufferable. Look NFL past weekend. single positive test entire league 1,000 players coaches. many Americans 70 % obesity rate? Oh God, embarrassing comment read. Honestly, guys really think this? I'm actually living real world everyday. see people acting actually talk people. see gotten information reddit considering wrong are. NC people basically back normal life. I've killing last months. Never making money entire life. People sitting around scared like are. also sitting around trying criticize everyone around like this. weird. kind insecurities making this. see people around succeeding like crazy now. worrying family really working them. Things actually really good.

I bought 2nd house week tell housing market booming right now. People buying houses cars like crazy NC (I got new truck talked dealership). good sign. know half unemployment entire country California? crazy. means rest country 8s good, especially live. Take New York things look even better. Thank god live one super liberal places. People killing here. know kid tell hard time figuring lot people actually experiencing. US alone something like 330,000,000 people. think get idea people feeling 4,000 comments reddit lol. Sorry, seem naive sheltered.

Let ask this, experiencing right now? I'm guessing things pretty good you. realize ton people situation. see around me. Even freaking pandemic, jobs open around (well long live shut place like California). Everyone living daily lives. accepted virus going away tomorrow time get on. 

They sit around cry like best make bad situation good possible. Thankfully people decide sit around cry like you. people like critize past pout like small child. offer solutions nothing help situation NOW. absolutely good anyone. Look comments. nothing help sad watch. 6 year old better understanding needs done help. people cannot look forward, look backwards. honestly pathetic way live life. Luckily people real world worried moving forward. things actually getting better. People like nothing better things actually even make things worse. Good thing contained sites like this. 

Maybe one day able change mindset start understand focusing make things better tomorrow. least try. know people need jobs. trying get another crew road business. need hire 3 people. 3 people income something day. hey, I'm sure sitting around crying yelling people helped way more. I'm sure done way help things out. bought another house new truck. realtor car salesman made additional commission. crying reddit probably better deed. 

I really feel sorry people like you. understand want put effort actually better things. get it. Noone forced this. least sit get way people actually trying make difference. Things tough lot people busting ass change things better. last thing need whiney kid telling stupid actually nothing themselves. gets old people get tired hearing idiots like you. us favor.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* right, bad.  Real question anyone sees this. I'm hearing people, trust, many deaths *primarily* caused covid, listed causing numbers artificially inflated. truth much 200k falls category? virus disappear 6 9 months. still duped ‚Äúlockdown 2 weeks‚Äù lie. Idiocracy, it‚Äôs plants crave. Tell two kids learning read Zoom can't find work fucking job single parent two young kids schooling home sell home, car, valuable belongings get relief soon. suffered major depression (severe according psych, wants see twice week now) I‚Äôm average employed dollars spare small social circ‚Äôe, leisure activities enjoy etc. depended simple things like walking around streets stores without anxiety, occasionally meeting friends coffee, sometimes going gym distract killing myself.... well can‚Äôt that. 

My building won‚Äôt even allow visitors, delivery past front entrance. congregating. socializing. Masks mandatory indoors EVERYWHERE except apartment. beautiful lobby couches tables? Looks like show room, hasn‚Äôt used aren‚Äôt allowed looks pristine new clean AF time. Kudos buildikg management setting rules following cleaning every surface NON-STOP always repainting fixing maintaining something somewhere. 

But cannot live apartment alone years. Though slowly accepting fate. think it‚Äôs there‚Äôs 200k confirmed Covid deaths, period there‚Äôs 240k excess deaths total, 40k ‚Äòextra‚Äô deaths unaccounted look predictive models. Likelihood Covid deaths too. car crash victims dying covid..... percentage would actually due worsened covid? doubt percentage would large all. someone put Trump r/nextfuckinglevel. Maybe aspires beat Stalin killing people. would bad Economy Sweden dealing spread corona long term way see problem border open.  common chronic conditions associated COVID¬†death¬†were¬†chronic lung disease¬†(28%), obesity (27%), neurological developmental disorders (21.5%), cardiovascular disease (18%), cancer (14%) diabetes (9%)

Developmental disorders obesity strike pretty glaring issues unlikely noticed. Similar story chronic lung disease. 

Diabetes cancer maybe undiagnosed early onset.  Except Victoria worst performing state Australia yet harshest lockdown rules states. logic absolutely hold context thread.

What works great leadership. almost it. alternative ask everyone else claim can‚Äôt ask vulnerable do. see cracks said someone drove Horner haircut get burger reasons lockdown breached. like ...what duck doing..

He trying reduce deaths keep people safe.. Yep, said happy. That's exactly said... bravo. Nice, though Cordoba calcifediol study already highly promising. Hopefully. must either tiny friends enormous microwave. Certainly. long tolerate children learning socialize zoom? critical point past degradation human life cannot justified. cannot live like worker bots right enjoy culture fun forever. Nope.  Viruses replicate body expelled billions. transmission direct almost direct. got flu shot today, sneezed, microchip came nose. masks outside effective? thought indoors thing, air circulation outdoors good. Never said completely avoid contagion, functional society, Mask comes social distancing. Many studies stated everyone wears mask, keep living pseudo normal life without spikes infections. ""underlying condition""... many people 21, hell 30 actually know ""underlying condition""? Young bodies resilient less likely get screened conditions typically minor symptoms.   excess covid deaths probably somewhere around 40 thousand? I'm happy enjoy shut house nothing novel do, must friends anything interesting look forward anyways, I'm happy gotten used it. rest us however would prefer go live actual human lives enjoy time planet reasonable effort contain virus instead crawling beds pretending like real word exist. We're #1! much winning! That‚Äôs actually true you‚Äôre still worst take account population differences. know enough people develop myocarditis stage period in, during, recovery? often need test. 

Who gonna pay MRIs Players, coaches, staff? 

If athlete gets Covid season blame? gets sued lasting health impacts end pro career starts? 

But there‚Äôs path play... get downvoted point going take years implement. understand people want hope situation, suppose that's stems from

Edit: people living bad comparison, feature bloat doesn‚Äôt apply here. üé∂Thats we're best! Arooooound! üé∂ Shut dribble Sounds like know virus work. 100% people US isolate Biden 'set example‚ÄôÔºü think so. No, that‚Äôs estimation increase expected number deaths. sub: great news! Finally kill remnant social life culture fully embrace live work policy. Tell neighbor's nephew who's learning read Zoom mom working two minimum wage jobs hours got cut social distancing. cannot sacrifice much human life indefinitely. Science solve pandemic cannot, coexisted diseases history learn move past coronavirus science cannot consign dustbin history Exactly. it‚Äôs fucking boring too.  instead locking elderly immunocompromised lock EVERYONE? 6 months ago said I'd grab popcorn watching US handle pandemic. keep running popcorns eat point guys dragging long. Well hold pants, we're going ride  science fiction cure magically stop spread disease, symptoms, without side effects, happy ending.

In case, cure. Effective vaccine may impossible. Remember, developed vaccine common cold virus coronavirus(not COVID-19) one one cause common cold.

Also, science fiction foresee rise anti-maskers, 5G conspiracy theorists, conspiracy random billionaires culprit.  called patriots think caring fellow countrymen pussies. point still stands, new Zealand got control 

Not really. New Zealand, literally best circumstances (very small population, 100% sea borders) political willpower, potential outbreak school. China apparently zero cases month. saying - something add up. That‚Äôs did. us lives work now. Wall Street laughing us, Bezos made couple billion small, local businesses destroyed government intervention. Yeah ohio decline progress since Amy Acton left. Ironically ohio done well combating covid friends/coworkers believe real thing. part ""about year"" = forever? lol Sees Trump person. 'slow claps' black white though. Masks completely stop spread need paired measures well. masks *that* effective need social distancing anything. guess what, do. There's research mentioned virus spreads Italy due industrial area north. smoke pretty much helping spreads. Yeah that's fine every time wake leave house accept risk yourself. one ever free harm. like feel safe time wrap bubble wrap roll bed monsters can't get you. Science eventually figure thing billions people especially youngsters social development damaged irreparably one done anything fun months. can't forever won't. true all. Adverse effects guaranteed. flu shot last year even redness.  disability due major mental health issues (guess ones ha) worked IT. Let tell you... deadline history modern world ever met time... it‚Äôs worse think... saying... know works, worked sides coin, let tell you, estimate ever accurate, even fixed. 

I hear ya... Stripped coping mechanisms... number still reported \~20% actually closer quarter million Everyone making like 2020 dumpster fire year, is. there's chance 12 months time we'll wishing 2020 again. ""Oh God remember dumpster fire year last year? Jeez I'd love simple dumpster fire right now"" plus side 4 million recovered  Potentially YOY excess deaths hit that.   tired winning yet? Yeah that's fine I'm gonna give next 60 years life vaccine 49.99% effective gave Granny sniffles. 1 year collective human enjoyment lost enough. show must go on. Inflated number strain evolved different region strain dna. country pretty much track strain comes country now. Nobody jack shit year. Halloween cancelled, Thanksgiving Christmas sure follow. yet resorted strawman attacks masks. mask wearing. realistic trade offs mitigation strategies.

Lockdowns panacea delaying tactic. Even New Zealand seen cases reappear despite one harshest lockdown approaches. Similarly, places like Spain, France UK seeing resurgences cases despite locking months earlier year. always expected happen. lockdowns delaying tactic, eradicate virus.

In addition cost them, UK instance alarm rung several times oncologists thousands missed cancer screenings lockdown, may inadvertently created timebomb even cancer deaths. also seen peoples mental health go toilet seen thousands put work. None things good long term health population.

When factor effected also lowest risk groups COVID, effectively harmed young healthy save elderly sick. longer lockdowns enforced diminishing returns becomes issue. 

It's idea applying lockdowns restrictions next year non starter. Best case vaccine vaccinate risk ease restrictions defer individuals weigh risks. enforce lockdown vulnerable; smaller population, already retired anyway minimal impact. done zero research, yet strong opinion it. happened order make ignorant? hope blas√© attitude towards spread older generation. would shame responsible contracting disease taking enough care.

There's plenty resources actually want learn. Heard immunity would somewhere around 60 80% population somewhere ballpark 198,601,590 264,802,120 american people catching covid. point I'm sure many would die would imagine lot hospitals would overwhelmed point many died 9/11? Never forget.  could 200,002.5, he's saved 2 half people, greatful! Trump underestimated numbers, true worst case yet come. Seriously. Every time wake leave house, accept risk death. vaccine widely available months, need accept exists stop delaying living lives. 5 year old kids learning read Zoom, parents living dole job can't legally open like travel tourism, young people unable make friends physical 3rd dimension. cannot live like forever earth can't headlines use 'and'. Let introduce Argentina I‚Äôd welcome 300 cases day 14.6 million. Missouri 5.5 million. 1/3 province‚Äôs population 6x cases. 18x infection spread. #4 total number cases yesterday whole US keep crawling top. states beating us daily cases California, Texas, Florida 39 million, 28 million, 21 million people respectively. 

We‚Äôve training son mask wearing fat chance stays day.  touches 5 minutes let alone 6 hours. OH waaaah, can't go bar concert restaurant year... That's lockdown, lol. Waiting FULL YEAR Christmas every year must hard you. I‚Äôm similar situation, except engaged it‚Äôs since last September me. supposed go April knows it‚Äôll possible. countries properly followed advice experts recovering

[The US 11th deaths per better countries enforced lockdown ""followed advice."" Unofficially like 400k Masks good supermarkets public transport - much bars, restaurants, offices family gatherings.  Inshallah. Corona halal? üò≥üò≥üò≥ [They were. wrong. Impressively wrong. Embarrassingly wrong. 

And missing point. Again, hearings within house absolutely 0 bearing trumps ability anything. Golfing hand. [He took 10 golfing trips jan 1 March 7. gets way actually leading country. Despite promising hed busy play golf. 


Again, trump actually balls testify congress maybe I'd agreeable. know, like hilary testified days Benghazi, actually managed job investigation totally dropped. 

Objectively, empirically, incorrect *clearly* absolutely comprehension government works all. I've provided data refuting point. actually proving Republicans hardly spoke covid mid March. I've shown trump spent thousands thousands dollars dozens hours golfing/traveling golf instead job. 

You're wrong. many levels. actually almost embarrassing. Culture socialization 2019, live work buy things Amazon. Read article published Nature yesterday. Less 10% hospitalized permanent lung damage, another also less 10% heart, another kidney, another liver on. point article falsely states 10k deaths attributed COVID claims part study Hong Kong University says wasn't. provides proof claims vague theories. 

Like Newsweek article said, probably impossible know engineered highly unlikely release intentional. 

Considering SARS 2003 came similar origin, chances natural well. legit still saying that.... lol k baffling US kind president yet he's still power.

What FUCK America see Americans know saying lock down? Death rates high. I‚Äôm honestly low key neurotic point. I‚Äôll keep maybe forever feels like one things protect even it‚Äôs going motions. percent come retirement homes? Might get better Easter Sunday 2021.  Also, flu still going happen well. Covid make flu go away. TBH banning travels China right thing Trump although highly unlikely due science/medical reasons knowing is.

Yet meanwhile, whatever fked reason, NYC, one geologically adjacent hub Italy, also heavy Italian presence connections, decided keep wide open 2nd worse affected region time. Airports literally took 0 actions. briefing ain't gonna make beautiful. Best country world ICMR (Kinda indian equivalent CDC) said missing 80cases every one detected. contact tracing point doctors recommending covid tests showing symptoms. one walking test centre inviting sample collecting people home justified fear catching infection them.

So yeah India testing mainly symptomatic people only. Lots product can‚Äôt find lately, example, sodas: Mr. pib/pib extra soda diet squirt. unable find anymore? Congratulations next india join [80% cases India may explain deaths high. Remember 15 soon 0? Big jump. worry, recently announced herd mentality save now. got much better left biggest issue conspiracy theories fucking entitlement. whole world dealing covid. Murica universe. countries gonna ruin economy kill population you. theories fall apart aware countries actually exist props movies. lot Americans seem capable that. hit 10,000 deaths, posted local forum (they talking herd immunity approach) herd immunity would reached somewhere around 1.35 million deaths.

They laughed suggestion. still bring absurd math I'm still million deaths. speak things almost over, even though nowhere near number infections (and future hopefully vaccinations) able declare thong passed. even full year. Also, covid magically make flu disappear. That's still going happen top everything else. Progressive sheep much worse? Please go vote anyway. least right side history. Literally commenting post 200 thousand dead Americans.

""Lol great here"" I'm glad panic. Lol! Yeah shame we're worth much Sure, always risk that. far they've kept new infection clusters control, cost course. guarantee keep way.

You good day too. Damn. considered finding new doctor?  Feb. 28, 2020, campaign rally South Carolina, President Donald Trump likened Democrats' criticism administration's response new coronavirus outbreak efforts impeach him, saying ""this new hoax."" speech also seemed downplay severity outbreak, comparing common flu.   
    What's False    
    Despite creating confusion remarks, Trump call coronavirus hoax.    
     
So, basically true, confirm 100% certainty Trump shitty speaking actual meaning gets lost. power sentence fragments broken thoughts.   
   
Further, regardless interpretation, entire context generally horrible. Lol, told Chinese bot bot. give whole dollar this.  Yeah people going stay home 2022. vulnerable vaccinated less worry they‚Äôll first line. Let‚Äôs fuckin gooooo! Try testing per confirmed case, math &amp; see sloppy US rating is. skip math you: catch VN's aggressiveness testing, US needs test nearly 5 BILLIONS people now.

For every patient found, VN track travel history &amp; tested 700 people, happened since case 1st fyi

Testing per million stupid, let's say 1 case whole country, happened New York, patient never set foot Alaska, everyone contact with, people tested negative, would logical testing Alaska then? context, total number Americans killed WWII... 291,000 (and took 4 years - Covid achieved two thirds less 7 months). way 500,000 apple.news may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Agree everything say except buddy. [80% cases see charts US last means theyvare first. 'Maybe that's life. ' don‚Äôt. Get enjoy life safe manner mask social distancing. one expected keep this. ÊÉä‰∫ÜÔºåÂêéÊéíÂêà‰∏™ÂΩ± It‚Äôs confirmed numbers underreported numbers purposely altered make look better, dangerous unscientific.

Yeah basically used virus commit genocide doesn‚Äôt like, many followers dying result.

I can‚Äôt fathom takes continue support psychopath. doesn‚Äôt care you. cares money wealthy supporters. That‚Äôs all. Fake news amiright fellas? winning son?  Holidays + postponed Spring Weddings happening Fall going hurt us much

Just look one Maine wedding wait November/December weddings + two biggest holidays. COVID target protests political causes believe kill anyone protests political causes oppose. absolutely unacceptable. 200k dying one thing, peeps. Lies. year :( Yes, people lost lives, livelihood land this. official head government response ‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù think know side spectrum keeps spreading misinformation doesn‚Äôt care this. could lose whole family still wouldn‚Äôt wear mask lot Americans *simply horrible, awful, ghastly people*. no, don‚Äôt feel bad one single fucking bit. hope hurt way lights went like got someone sick paying attention.  Hello Steve Bannon confirm, I‚Äôm doctor Sure, all-in-all amazing americans make out. batshit crazy. way entire world, mostly interested US, rightfully so, letting millions people die tanking economies make Trump look bad. Anyone thinks that, words. bounced back anywhere near normal levels pandemic keeps going like we'll hit number year 2 Back wave 3 bursted, many residents put noticing paper front door literally saying: ""we came back Da Nang self quarantining, pls visit us least next 14 days"".

By time knew wave 3 last long. countries bad too, shutting economy help need Karens Kens everywhere! Definitely it. Aches Wednesday Couldn‚Äôt breath Thursday chest pain could barely walk kitchen without getting winded. Slept much past 4 days. Today worst migraine. Seem tail end I‚Äôm feeling lot better breath again! lung heart damage thankfully work paid full sick. Shit real sucks!  Seriously. One bite one that‚Äôs enough year. think isolationist existence benefit NZ long term?  Epic deaths Highly unlikely, given mortality dropping vaccines looking promising. hey people getting bored reopen stuff.  upvote non-communist country sending far white coats pandemic? communist propaganda always get upvoted? Really sorry, throwing insensitive reddit joke there. 

My hope testing vaccines, least start see loved ones get back life. may going stadium packed concerts next year think we'll coming back normal spring. Stay strong, still young buck.  knew someone worked buffet said conditions food sanitation wise horrible  Impressively bad vast majority medical papers considered peer reviewed two authors ( one three). AKA - Two peers reviewed this.

According one top experts issue, way definitively tell one way scientists saying otherwise effectively guessing.

Pay attention Rutgers professor quoted   disappear summer, beautiful, less dangerous regular flu......... also inside money going Australia countries. It'll go away apocalypse. Also literal brainwashing right Exactly, unfortunately they‚Äôre open January they‚Äôre going open spring semester even miracle cure discovered, it‚Äôs unreasonable expect students move moments notice middle semester. /u/cav2010 already jumped immaturity train upvotes. Reddit fucking sucks. Get married January 2022. wedding first time see face! believe anything said, especially part sounds like burner accounts past months trying use story. Oof irony Source?
Genuinely Lol. Talk first world problem. I've read paper. provides evidence, peer review claims already rejected scientific community. 

I'd surprised funded Bannon. really happened you? Maybe wear fucking masks stay away other? Oh please. articles debunked (checks notes) May. Hospital billing highly regulated watched. People paid paid well find fraud within Medicare system. 

Covid actually diagnosis can‚Äôt presumed treated paid way. regs specifically say test positive get paid it. US country didn‚Äôt adopt ICD-10 code presumed case. directions applying code case CDC, governs codes used US REQUIRES positive lab test. Source: medical coder.

Edit: words typing reply 1 mad stupidity, leads spelling errors.  good live

Okay, really hope still going go vote anyway. lot extra deaths people avoiding normal medical treatment. deaths technically covid, still result covid. hanging kind low days. feeling backed numbers somewhere Honestly, don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd living them, always stuck listening long non stop conversations all. moved two months ago. don‚Äôt talk politics, since know don‚Äôt agree. 

Honestly, they‚Äôre predictable. Whatever Fox News talking points are, that‚Äôs believe. mom goes deeper right wing conspiracy stuff. Believes 5G deep state crap. Anything that‚Äôs crazy supports Trump, that‚Äôs it‚Äôll be. people absolutely care immediate family, I'm boat you. hope decent people going lives jobs force get medical care, can't really care people going bars parties, families spread to. see failure. People follow lockdowns year, think leader history could dealt large nation like US kept low death count. 

The rapidly rising numbers European countries despite stringent controls show best delaying inevitable shit going sweep population entirely. Lol damage already done. It‚Äôs going away matter wins. Let's see many murder charges rack up, file against. America better.

Can though? seems like fundamental problem national psyche. nation entitled, overconfident, anti-intellectual idiots. -'While understand money necessary tool, bottom line somehow becomes top priority health community baffles me. 

It baffle you, everyone! singularly telling national values.

I glad people pushing back. hope.

Yes, keep mom baby safe. sheltering still other's short list acceptable people. immediate family. cousins. kids/families time. Maybe next year.

Its ok ramble. think able talk bit forums help social isolation. 

Sleep well.  people actually start wearing masks, social distance shelter place. Unless massive change, area above.  Bleach. That's 3%. bad COVID19. expect mortality rate since COVID19 novel corona-virus?  America numero uno!!! üá±üá∑üá±üá∑üá±üá∑üá±üá∑ Also Elon Musk Even strictest tlockdown news station broadcasting infeon government building course landscapers working it. least going pretty healthy, right die third time. Everything said true Trump comparison unfounded. Gates went upper middle class become riches guy planet building company ground new field compared Trump basically took dad's business. lot motorcycle fatalities Cv-19 listed CoD

You liar ashamed yourself. Yeah sure, bet Jinping calls week live update every province country. 

You deluded think government would tell truth, literally arresting doctors, nurses reporters outbreak started, telling truth really happening. 

So, assume pro CCP? remember, regardless believe, death person, family, loved ones.

Millions grieving Americans. Millions. really isn‚Äôt though. There‚Äôs mostly uniform information exception far right media, likes say whatever they‚Äôd like. People die constantly though. tragic life tragic. looks like ~3 million people US die every year, also lot, let get me.

Granted, close mortality side say have, trying see side. Awful Wisconsin. serious shit  I'm sorry, no. Health care fraud one highest priorities FBI ones looking it.

The average hospital brings $334 million annually. 1.1 million covid patients serious greater symptom classification (but die). Let's say HALF falsely put ventilator billed (incredibly unlikely). That's 220 bonus patients per hospital 6,140 hospitals US. medicaid paid one extra money coming 0.5% increase hospital's average take home.

* one highly focused scrutinized pandemics history.

* Using one paper trail heavy systems (medicaid).

* one paper trail heavy industries (medical care)

* people consistently accusing fraud since lockdowns began, doubt increasing odds regulators pushed find fraud.

You're mind. talk hospitals hurting money due lack elective surgeries, going fuck 0.5% re-gain revenue. Committing business ending fraud conditions amount money make difference financial situation? honestly think that's happening rampant scale?

TL;DR People genuinely believe actually put thought it

Edit: put thought it. could probably actual investigation besides looking existing CDC statistics patient numbers ventilator use, cross reference international statistics run statistical analysis accounting comorbities would increase likelihood vent easily detect whether ventilator fraud likely happening US hospitals. point would one investigative journalist junior FBI agent find smoking gun evidence good enough conviction. allow get away this.

*Narrator: will.* 10k deaths though. CDC reported that.

I wonder people blamed Obama H1N1.
Oh wait downvoting degen. get reported hate speech People want treated seriously. Mistakes made, mistakes still made, think people willing accept done correct intention.
 
Similarly, Queensland people bashing premier wanting open border, greater number seem fine border staying closed longer means keeping things control. according Jane Janine local neighborhood page say sending kids deaths. Shows IFR 1% like places. everyone knows, undercount. Include unusual amounts heart attacks, pneumonia, etc. higher. think 200,000 number inflated hospitals scamming money government.

So heard hospitals paid government. saw reports deaths things like pneumonia influenza counted covid tests. conspiracy theory goes hospitals paid extra report covid caused death death certificate says something else.

In reality, hospitals paid extra, fact they're likely paid less since negotiating insurance companies accept government terms payment. Also, due extreme similarity symptoms, general unavailability rapid teating, unclear guidance initially hospitals certifying death caused things covid coding deaths covid deaths. 

Like conspiracies big misunderstanding general lack motivation research truth. comforting think threat accept hilariously poorly we've done containing responding it. Plus there's weird idea doctors general Scrooge McDuck vaults money they're paid keep secrets shit. weird. Damn dude. absolutely get it. can‚Äôt die gunshot. die untreated bleeding. either serum plasma. isn‚Äôt urine. wildfires dry standpoint fire. #Winning
#Letting200kPeopleDieToOwnTheLibs Sadly enough care stage 4 lockdwon, example people mowing lawns banned. Automatic car washes well.

Uh, could mow lawn wash car driveway, pay business mow lawn wash car (or travel so) deemed essential... 

...Because really end day.  Bannon. That‚Äôs blood looks like without cells particulate matter. It‚Äôs either serum plasma. Honest question - saying now? know got virus wedding? go grocery store places every day. went wedding got sick two weeks later would even know wedding?

Honest question. trying ass. Everyone can‚Äôt agree I‚Äôm thankful said this. I‚Äôm done everything. feel like don‚Äôt give shit anything point. Empty perfect word. I‚Äôm fucks give. don‚Äôt care lose job, don‚Äôt care lose house, don‚Äôt care. strive anything many people would rather bury heads sand instead trying solve problems. post even see many upvotes... NZ's opposition leader thinks NZ government done poorly.

It must right leaning thing believe good. Voting, apparently. Conservatives like claim wave dead people voting every election. WOOOO WE'RE NUMBER ONE!!!! Guys COVID army going 200,000 strong! Best community youtube! specify year? Neither, happen live know what's going on. What? it‚Äôs not. Diabetes causes heart disease someone heart attack didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdie diabetes‚Äù Good see made full recovery twice Mazeltov! Saying make wrong. understand country's policies this, reflects back Nah, means gonna sick, tired winning ""as worst"" not? vote him. good run office, vote. need straight talker. looked up. ICL produce Swedish model. Uppsala University did. really matter built ICL.

A big part model's deaths predictions wrong role ICUs capacity. know people less serious cases, also overreact overtreat symptoms. There's also likely effect seasonality. impacts ICU usage. Sweden also tests underreports deaths (that is, cases people dying never entering ICU). ways model could off, without necessarily changing basic reasons disease concern. could argue maybe lockdown policies unecessary, things return normal.

Ferguson called ""professor lockdown"" sort political football. AIER, National Review, clear biase.  knew going happen back march... yet still know people think hoax *smash bros* ""New record!"" Nooooo! can‚Äôt stand them. Lol. like see around. Remember opening Easter? ‚Äú10-fold‚Äù, 12,000 well year, significantly less deadly flu, didn‚Äôt even shut things people wear masks. COVID-19 200,000+ people die, least, states shutting (mostly T‚Äôs wishes), considerable people wearing masks (T supporters proudly don‚Äôt wear masks, killing countless).

You can‚Äôt compare two it‚Äôs silly even try. That's happens giant Wotsit leader. agree, that's important make distinction least genuinely tried, vs maliciously negligent Holy shit. fucking guy acting like it‚Äôs okay 200,000 people died. fuck wrong you?  wears hazmat suits. somehow shut world Swine Flu... Look India‚Äôs covid graph No, don‚Äôt. money comes elective surgery. like everyone want pass, want people get elective surgeries. 
As losing money since haven‚Äôt figured ends paying expenses hospital incurred times. 

To knowledge hospitals danger shutting like restaurants.  one died terrorism world trade centers, fire buildings falling forcing sanitary measures public places

Like what? feds authority, purpose. Blame states. strong federal government design liberty depends that. lol responds twice Ok stand corrected. right make choice *other people, maybe many them*, care everything get (like ""fucking mask shit"").

In countries, proposing criminal. book, least deeply immoral. choosing act awful, stay away people. choose get COVID you. Remember 2.2 million prediction? Yeah, they're pushing hard way:

1. Here's proof

(bunch links)

When point fact they're talking pre-prints even support they're suggesting word word revert to...

2. going discuss papers?

Has coming one conspiracy-type subreddits filled wingnuts. illegal die twice. 50 Lakh = 5 Million

90,123 new cases previous day! love awkward man can't help respond multiple times post, stranger wronger time before. Fox news wake right up. feels like half country living 1984 version society half brave new world. LOL! We've gone like 6 months without tourism point, still yet implode. Auckland lock down(level 2.5) rest country level 2 really means large crowds gatherings.Pretty tame really.  easier outraged reddit comment actually read article. change said though? matter people heard that, anyone half brain could see already hot areas magically disappearing. whole thing strange personally live small town, county 54 total deaths long time ago never increased since.

I always relate existence living snow globe, due little everything around world seems affect area.

EDIT: actively try just, avoid news thinking this. lot easier avoid poor mental health. Feeling hopeless, you. Yep chronic depression here. trying take day time, it‚Äôs crazy seeming first time ever there‚Äôs actually reason depressed. Thanks kind words. felt like came people dying might able come together. amount local state lvl corruption seen. right disguising less did. time (late March), Italy past peak. two countries two-sided curve available China South Korea. looked curves, saw ramp took 6 weeks, ramp also took similar time, thought US would end around 60,000 deaths. know unlike China, Korea, even European countries whose curves took longer fall, pandemic would keep going US. Even now, six months later, we've settled norm 1,000 weekdays 400 deaths weekends. think every vote matter, state, least help push mandate makes harder Trump dispute. Censorship suppression opinion disgusts me. Oh, hi mods üëã  wouldn‚Äôt wrong. Sure, asthma won‚Äôt kill you, matched something makes harder breath, it‚Äôs covid killed you, it‚Äôs combination. list covid death isn‚Äôt true. 


The CDC, almost every person who‚Äôs vouching covid terrible uses, even found 90% ‚Äúcovid deaths‚Äù underlying conditions. can‚Äôt write say, ‚Äúnope, doesn‚Äôt count we‚Äôre pandemic.‚Äù That‚Äôs ignorant. That's also bullshit workers turned away testing sites lack tests. tested weekly due working highly public nature. trouble since June.

There plenty people want need tests still. Maybe town, town struggling again. remember March randomly calling mother

She said lucky wonderful president office.

I held tongue said uh-huh know mom...

If knew knew docile ‚ÄùYou 15 people, 15 within couple days going close zero, ‚Äù. many days Easter? couple? Nah reported same. clearly don‚Äôt understand data saying. really look total death certificates times. additional 220,000+ deaths expected average. Back considerable jump deaths average could almost considered statistical noise. We're #1! We're #1! We're #1! Apgar score used assess overall health infant looking things like whether breathing/crying/moving, good color, etc. 

A low score often means baby deprived oxygen health issues.

It's somewhat predictive health outcomes even academic performance.  Name death count disease hasn‚Äôt gone up? That‚Äôs kind things do. March 6th makes blood boil. 

You smart, Mr. Trump. Stop trying act like are. Ohh god, remember press conference clearly. pieces shit. bad case swine flu turn blood thickened slurry way SARS2 does. think so, punishment cruel, punishment unusual, punishment can't both. I'd say unusual, cruel. Almost. Article says hospital employee lives someone attended wedding. Connection likely sure prove came wedding not... know... hospital. 2.5 million people U.S. die every year. care them. care 89 year olds passing fits agenda. Stop fear mongering. nuke it, problem solved. Can't stop, stop. much thing beginning pandemic. yes excess deaths lie create huge changes short period time (I.e lockdowns.) it‚Äôs definitely starting head way. Well Whitehouse took reporting too. Lol you‚Äôre wasting time right now. WE‚ÄôRE NUMBER ONE! WE‚ÄôRE NUMBER ONE! BAHAHAHAHAHA 400,000 deaths prediction IMHE model. Many people questioned assumptions cases/deaths rise exponentially head Fall Winter. I'm skeptical conclusions, new cases/deaths heading downwards direction now, irrespective badly federal state governments botched response. rate spread Coronavirus seem depend temperature/humidity directly; instead, spreads easier people congregate indoors without precautions. everything comes human behavior. impossible predict people behave coming months. One simply cannot draw conclusions IHME model based currently available data case numbers R0. Even Vietnam's news reported Chinese state-owned media Xinhuanet. believe word China! /s excuse thread agreeing trump personally killed 200,000 people otherwise nobody would died, please leave! alone, one feels way.

If first experience depression, encourage seek professional help able access. already established coping mechanisms depression know weather storm, batten hatches know sun shine day. giant load horse crap. know least four college kids stoked Covid (Indiana, Clemson). means don‚Äôt get tested 90 days. One lives frat house Indiana partying like dumbasses it. get 300k? Well thanks memories probably lot unhealthy country. Obesity, diabetes, complete addiction sugar leads things. Lack exercise etc. healthy country whole begin with... Ask extra deaths coming since every cause death, possible exceptions car accidents workplace accidents, also up. 

Pneumonia particular something like 4x be.

These ""fake covid deaths"" come somewhere right? form death **inexplicably** reduced compared previous years stats. 2-2.5

That's low side table 1.

2.5 3 pretty estimated R0 the
pooled distribution median 2.9 (95% CI: 2.1‚Äì4.5). point estimate R0
is similar reported values date range, confidence intervals wider
than one study. result imply assumptions based pooled
estimate weak; believe confidence interval accurately reflects the
level uncertainties present information available models matters 50 percent uses 2 that's almost certainly low. maybe 50-70 percent better range. fucking 5,000 poisoning look CDC website. heard safety issues! Noice! Honestly I‚Äôd start building wall Canada. remember Chicago 2 cases monitored got it. 

8000 dead now. Compared normal year literally none done level whatsoever, even slightest effort curtail flu bit. Even areas lax rules people still going concerts/ballgames importantly **work** numbers typically do. right, silly compare two one includes deaths causes one doesn't. They'll include motorcycle death one counts. Let's ""downplay"" count covid deaths covid deaths say 7 people properly social distance point themselves... one morons given post ""Faith Humanity restored"" ""Feeling recharged"" award?  It‚Äôs crazy normal absurd death rates now. used least pause think every 9/11 many people killed. year didn‚Äôt even realize 9/11 end workday put date piece paper thought ‚ÄúOh yeah it‚Äôs 9/11.‚Äù left work without second thought. death toll nearly 3,000 significant seems like almost nothing now. feel like U.S. bit skewed NY/NJ. Although TBF could say Italy Lombardy. Congrats! flu likely closest disease general population familiar COVID. basically 10 seasons flu packed 1. I‚Äôve three cases food poisoning made sick days. three happened eating buffets.  Medical malpractice would around 250000 next going position 3 annually killer.

You fever, yet difficult swallow water let alone food. feel either hot cold regardless temperature outside inside body. 

For least part illness weak anything outside bed except go toilet.  

I doubt able run blocked nose actually flu instead bad cold. think that‚Äôs median cautious people survive. Survival fittest guess. population, general, cautious? I've heard varies region, Kaiser area fussy it. Day 2 3.

You never stop crying personally lost. flu doesn‚Äôt take cardiovascular system eternally fuck it‚Äôs vegetable. knows lol...
Tens millions recovered past 9 months, let remind you. apocalypse want be.
If one death many, one miss cancer screening due lockdown? millions fallen food insecurity? increase suicides? could implemented measures protect nursing home/aged care residents, yet basically nothing effective.

Actually did... state level. vast majority nursing homes impacted private profit homes use federal guidelines, last time checked ratio around 200 cases private nursing homes every one state system (private homes outnumber public, something like 4 1). Also people think ruined lives never counted :

- People debt medical bills

- People ruined health doesnt kill leave lot damage Perhaps let us finish digging graves telling us throw roses them. Get new doctor, one murders less. [non-paywall talk, based data last week

No, mourning comes later. We‚Äôre still fighting war ideologies here. Science denialism. Accountability political fear mongering. Selfishness stupidity society hope.

I refuse mourn enemy enemy also victim crime. constitution limits federal government, state government. *One single black balloon descends rafters* 

We it! CDC numbers lag couple months. pastor's name [Todd he's news already holding services [encouraging congregants wear article, six seven deaths caused Todd Bell visiting rehab center holding church services. means ***one*** death caused wedding, ***six*** deaths caused bad pastor. 400,000+ projection comes IHME model. predicts deaths soar head November December. Frankly, believe model making big assumptions little evidence right now. Irrespective badly US botched it, new cases deaths gradually coming down, people wearing masks several months ago. possible could big surge starting late Fall, nothing current data suggest outcome. previously thought Coronavirus could disappear summer surge winter. Instead, got large summer surge across southern western states. spread virus obviously depend lot human behavior temperature/humidity outside.

\* Also, would like point back April, IHME model predicted US end 60,000 deaths: seein link, model predicted 160,000 March. whatever reason, IHME model produced predictions varied wildly one direction other. Unfortunately, model seems White House using. following different model lately uses Machine Learning principles make projections: model fluctuates much less, predicting around 220,000 deaths November 1 (although baseline 5,000 deaths behind Worldometers, 220,000 really 225,000). It‚Äôs okay, narrow minds rarely think capacity. Already have, doesn‚Äôt work them. They‚Äôre immune reality. large majority deaths likely preventable. So, good math, empathy. past keeps going up. That's works. #number 1 guys would Trump apologists. Covid's gonna fall cliff.  positive covid test (and test everyone goes hospital) states count covid death regardless die. (counting covid death mean covid listed cause death necessarily). guidelines vary.  Even January Wuhan people wearing goggles. took contacts late Jan haven‚Äôt worn since. 

I‚Äôm super blind though really miss peripheral vision. googled fake address post like fifth thing show up. janitors. hope economic recovery full employment public works program emphasis restoring infrastructure green energy. reusable N95 Italian engineers designed one, two months this.... sure excuse this. Sweden [ban gatherings 50 including religious services. assume support that? Maybe would accept 300,000 dead year everything reopen.

WTF? serious? re-open things without killing 300k people year, things actually already open many places. Cars mandated seatbelts airbags, let's try mandating masks mitigation efforts?

I know think 300k dead people would buy us: getting go movies bars? thanks. cannot compare ""every benefit automotive transport"" ""some non-essential services re-opening."" Worst trade-off ever. American, absolute worst part American culture putting anything else. power individual. benefit me? sucks. know it‚Äôs estimated antibodies last least 4 months, know long minimum T-cells last? think peoples thoughts got bearing actually got it, endemic. misread comment even understand peer reviewed. obviously read it.

It 2 researchers names right document confirmed work. facepalm. uk currently banning groups 6 people meeting

People live allowed socialise households well Czech restrictions released way early on. government changes mind everyday, give us mandate wear mask shared spaces. Makes sense. live San Diego. surf, run spend several hours outside every single day. sick since 2010. even sniffles. think make good points there. contradictory politicians' part. one point, de Blasio saying restaurants probably reopen indoor dining 2021. Cuomo saying could someone would enforce safety measures.

I've dined outdoors times. feel measures enforced sufficiently outdoor dining (customers walking tables without masks on). I'm wary higher risk indoor dining. I'm trying support local restaurants ordering hot take delivery.

I also miss socializing. We've got group friends live NJ, Long Island various outer boroughs. Every year, get together Christmas dinner. likely going first time 20 years, probably closer 30 years, done it.

We're going figure video gathering. Unless things dramatically improve. We're 50s 60s lot elderly relatives consider, we're going err side caution. same, feel responsible thing do. silver lining friend New England probably able join us. Normally put Face Time pass phone around.  Remember start everyone touting 5-10 years? ‚ÄúSlow‚Äù describe it. scientists remarkable one throw bone stop discrediting they‚Äôre trying save literal millions lives? People almost 0 chance dying COVID separated loved ones hundreds miles concerned catching COVID. surprise anyone? think there‚Äôs simple explanation. It‚Äôs admin. whatever extra step takes push stats national level may priority local admin staff. And, going admin experience I‚Äôve done Sweden, either super streamlined annoying process ever. guess would latter. someone decided wait batch reporting. Say goodbye money. Almost exactly Sweden, except required wear masks ANYWHERE ALL. want believe it, won't. lie say believe abc would believed xyz happened. Lockdowns work long ever planning lifting lockdown.  We'll let know FDA says pesky AZ case. Covid size estimates 200nm 50nm.

Also, expect lay person able understand determine truth stated evidence expert biomedicine even framework understand truth. understand statistical concepts like p values, standard deviation variance, expect understand strength research they're reading?

This *why* experts giving public advice. supposed tell us salient points current research, accepted understanding even tells us actually really known. can't experts everything. expect leading astronomer able give good advice socioeconomics, even though expert particular field. They'd still listen leading authorities subject opinions.

People absolutely get involved science scientifically literate, everything broken bite size sentence two anyone understand. Like Texas Florida(undercounted). deaths California. 11 million people California Texas. Twice many Florida. It‚Äôs politics vs science. point, overall cons mask mandates outweigh overall pros mask mandates. point lies judgement call, absolute scientific fact. Covid-prevention value hold society. misunderstand me, blame Corona. blame lockdown policies response it, I'm glad see enlightened governments across world abandoning shortsighted strategy. 

See, agree completely last statement. Thr government fucked us all. Far actually saved; fact I'd argue cause global death, lost years life, prevent. 

It's actually interesting much common ground us. blame government controlling virus administrators terrible plans.

In many places local government opened bars university insists students can't go them. convincing message!

Unfortunately small local interests want keep bars/restaurants costs throw fit. correct, slopes totally different... yeah, Murica bad... US mass producing least two speak lol I‚Äôm introvert hell me. want least see friends hours.. Yes, vaccines make *body* things triggering immune response. totally normal. Yeah I‚Äôm thinking 2 months second dose start wind wearing masks. I‚Äôll probably stop wearing one around neck pull running past people first, gradually go if....the covid MADE die it. DIDNT get covid, would still alive , able manage diabetes

FAKE DEATHS!!

-_- Fine. say inserted PRRA sequence furin cleavage site? I've aligned 2003 SARS-CoV, bat pangolin coronaviruses neither PRR insertion sequence TQTNS. There's extra 4 aminoacid 12 nucleotide human SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein's furin cleavage site.

edit: typo closed cases 4% resulted death. Agreed, hard know right it. Sure guy whatever ya say. Unbelievable. absolutely pessimistic whole situation gonna make fun opinion. Yeah dog shit I'm used there's much us individuals alter situation. Things going changing next 10 months, like going entirety it. like least give little bit hope, own. Fauci lie, along rest medical establishment, Gupta Dr. Wen CNN. liars - doesn‚Äôt matter well intentioned. cost many lives. Feb March, ppl asking masks buy daily discussion subject abuse snark (‚Äúdonate hospital selfish oaf‚Äù). 

If start worshipping Fauci sort benevolent superhuman, lost Trumpsters, dumbass Early messaging masks necessary general public, may even harmful worn incorrectly wearing mask all.

Exactly. Also remember TTC drivers wanted wear masks told no, ""wearing medical masks mandated may 'create false sense security lead neglecting essential measures hand hygiene practices."" official position. Masks treated single category (lumping cloth medical masks), wearing useless worse general population (treating proper mask use something far complex *hoi poloi* master, despite whole handwashing education campaign premised public's ability learn proper technique).

Toronto started recommend masks April, following federal lead. De Villa (chief medical officer) issuing different guidance that. Exactly. title says ""side effects"" ""mild side effects"" cause ""mild side effects"" rather mundane expected. would make assumptions personal life based opinions partying college? rude contributes nothing discussion. typical certain mindset, though. ""If agree means something wrong you"". No, case. nothing particular wrong me. opinion justified based upon facts present discussion. People engage deplorable behavior get privilege higher education. privilege reserved deserving people. know think reflects *my* life circumstances. one engaging irresponsible behavior, one want subsidize people. US 5 million deaths get there. i.e thats people know maybe even dead. Yeah, locking really gonna change amount tourists coming in. one going drop $$$$$ overpriced Trump merch right election go around kinds things already. Same. still could reccomeneded cloth masks instead saying masks inneffective ITT: Hindsight Bias LETSSS GOOOOO BOYS!!! want see bad reporting look China April 17. (And ot talking reporting wrong numbers.) 


Or Russia missing completely: 


There real mess. Sweden. India‚Äôs neighbor, Pakistan, done far better job managing pandemic. begs question, feel need place personal blame COVID deaths people, apply standard every disease March?

Have ever coughed public? know end asymptomatically spreading transmittable illness killed someone line?

I honestly can't wrap head around people like you. university students staff volunteered on-campus want participate distance learning. threat known accepted. There's evidence came wet market, lot evidence contrary:
[LiveScience - coronavirus really start Wuhan 'wet caves bats live 1000 miles form Wuhan:

[Wuhan lab ‚Äòexperimented bats cave coronavirus may ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs tour ICU!‚Äù Unfortunately, pretty expensive way get sick. really dangerous older obese pre-existing condition. frying pan fire, then? 150 deaths Spain reported today single area. high number probably delayed reporting effect. Look averages want understand what's happening, single day exceptions mean nothing make catchy headlines. Spain issue, 250 people dying per day Spain. questioning degree shouldnt even question, masks help therefore everyone obviously fucking wear them, make basic masks even better? 1.4 million healthcare workers laid off. Rural hospitals filing bankruptcy left right. patrick! saved hospitals! 

So rona's fault demonstrably shittest healthcare developed world prioritizes quarterly profits citizens wellbeing? 1.4 million healthcare workers getting laid greedy CEO's rona. got figured apparently sweetheart?

Why Sweden's overrun? sacrificed elderly let die mass die offs nursing homes. 

Oh comparing Scandi country - culture already social distancing without rona - fucking anglo country arguing bad faith pure simple lol. US sucks. Tell government done last, let‚Äôs say century, managed approve start within matter hours? Spoiler, nothing 300k+ excess death far year, man that's wild summer pneumonia outbreak.

6% number people even pneumonia listed, actually means 6% US COVID death healthy people dropped dead. well said female scientist fled china claimed virus made lab mistake, I'll edit say /r/coronavirus  director CDC kindly shut fuck instead see weak flu season Sweden 2019 spared many fragile people. 

The average last two years actually better average four before.

Yes. Muuuuuch soon üéâü¶†üéâ we‚Äôre number 1! show gets approved, US moving immediately get vaccination drive started. won‚Äôt one things gets approved it‚Äôs another month anything gets done.

Once vaccine gets approved, it‚Äôll matter days 1st responders hospital workers get vaccinated.

This important even totally incompetent administration, plan get distributed fast Driving choice catching covid not. reading glasses? buy Walmart. cheap think. could get really weak pair wear store w/e. Lol. right listened science? left ignores biology whenever claim believe people born wrong body. 

The left anti-science right suits values. problem isn't. 50% OBESE people. knows number fat people, cant find number anywhere seriously expect reasonable discussion r/maskfetish? ""surgeons wear them"" argument ad nauseum amount sources change it. See, sub ""fololwing science"" special exception science contradicts circlejerk.  Us introverts well quarantine. Business usual. Especially gamer. waiting someone counter Italy. might best example lockdown proponents thus far. bravo. Germany rigid lockdown I'm really counting it. live Spain probably won't. Though much worse first time, can't handle second lockdown economy already going lot country's economy lives tourism, hotels bars.  seriousness though, things sold amazon supplied brand companies. go business, longer supply amazon Covid generation special. positives negatives culture change necessarily. There‚Äôs going back.... good percentage people know (and theres lot grown NYC) kind good idea got it.  boss called office 1 hour meeting, family work for, sadly friend clue without knowing gave grandparents got symptoms died within 12 days showing first symptoms (one day 10 one day 12). wife complain. genuine desire improve classroom students (teaching blended classroom, PreK, K, 1, 2), even means spending (our) pocket. donate time fixing classroom's broken chromebooks small rural school department.

If complaining made difference all, things would different. public schools US ever received appropriate funding? think so, least lifetime. Ok thanks I'll edit, thought Moderns Yep. wear mask daily longer trust anything CDC, WHO, Fauci, Surgeon General tells me. They've proven they'll knowingly lie - detriment health - support agenda. understand thought needed lie I'll never believe anything say. clear, think they're always wrong think trusted. bunch dudes playing dudes disguised dudes. literally 12 instances exact joke thread lmao Bullies. fervently hope real time prison. That's main issue Peru, lot people stay home informal jobs needed work daily survive, lot lives crammed single bed rooms, much 10-15 people single 10x10ft room capital city.

 one going different place work almost health precautions going back rooms rented per day definitely made virus infect lot people almost non existent resources.

Luckily, steady decline number new infections daily deaths last weeks deaths Asian flu pandemic ‚Äò50‚Äôs, third deaths (so far) Spanish flu pandemic...and still, country whole isn‚Äôt understanding much numbers directly federal govt inactions times even obstructionist actions. Suppose number needs hit 1 million people US wake up?!?!??! Honestly flu. 50,000 people die every year yet half America get basic shot free insurance. People gross. Glad proven wrong? Interesting, that's good hear. say they're following guidelines, people supposed stay table mingle tables, said often sees tables full indoors. nothing suggest infected large scale. working theory infection rare. 

The ones reported relapses medical anomalies body produce store anti body formula cells induce immunity. would terrific visual normalized number tests performed; anyone seen anything like that? Still, there‚Äôs plausible explanation Eco fucking R1 found genome. article defames paper. refute it.

Edit: EcoR1 ask. one widely used DNA scissors there. extra devices networked, least internet, can't get infected except direct sabotage. study done breaks co-morbidities COVID-19 patients? example, X 100 COVID-19 patients CKD, X great. stupid argument, live Netherlands btw. love decades proof masks make difference certain Asian countries thrown windows many, especially NL.

Here nuances many people seem understand:

- NL make difference definitely mean masks useless.

- masks proven make difference countries

- different effects depending location?

- maybe ONE factor play influencing contamination/spread virus?

It fair say masks MAY anything Dutch, UNFAIR say masks useless per se.

Why DIFFICULT understand? nuanced critical thought process happens. people fit Vermont Big Ten, there‚Äôs phone call coach LSU line 2, think take it, says it‚Äôs important! is. Maybe...doctors without borders come native reservations. Sad cus government didn‚Äôt help. Yall act like Americans running around coughing other's faces. true. problem natural recombination hypothesis host would possible. argument original article making page 9. Since science based ""because said so!"" ???

For quite now. Certainly expelled. say *WHICH* Easter though.

/s  tested June. bill gates?  bill gates?  renown virologist?    need listen knows subject.  products get infected fatal virus's time' Go White! Well agree that. also agree mass protests either crowds=covid without masks  moved goalposts point? could've watched china copied step step. 

For idiots asking economy, look economy right now. Look China's economy right now. Japan might well hold Olympics China right now. Keeping cases likely easier states without big urban centers. Like Vermont. Go White! Oh man. buy that. lot issues relationship first months. Thankfully met middle well toughest period far. Small back yard hangouts life saver. Fall winter interesting though can‚Äôt hang outside. No, goal get people pending weddings cancel kill people. Really? remember Dr Fauci clearly saying ‚Äòmasks don‚Äôt work‚Äô anyone half braincell trusted doctors Go Green! right though, anyone go grocery store April? People hoarding water entire grid going shut down. Still barely find freezer chest there's still paper product shortages. 

So right people would absolutely hoarding triage situation make decisions. What's alternative? Hey masks great please buy any? know people way selfish that, I'll point March/April pandemonium that. Well sending doctors one way make lot money. get paid Cuban govt pennies Cuban govt charges. I'm also really disappointed this. (For context I'm Canada recommendation individuals wearing masks stood [April Masks became mandatory city mid-July remain mandatory 2021.)

I'm professional engineer. read stuff understand it, covid lockdown like people caught reading latest research papers online discussions, little ""doom scrolling"" come known. remember feeling really silly wearing mask Walmart March literally nobody else was. sat car good 10 minutes going garbage homemade cotton mask.

I desperately wanted ranting Facebook blasting Twitter mask usage, general rule want making health related statements social media directly contradict public health officials. I'm health professional, are. know best trusted provide best information public.

In hindsight, clear correct, wrong, get us? Next time there's public health crisis emergency supposed research hoping get right again?

No.

That's job. always get right. want get sucked conspiracy theories. want government elected appointed officials job better, start trying re-gain trust public. this, they?

I want yet another person social media ranting government wrong, way outside actual expertise. mishandling masks pandemic struck major blow ability handle future problems. necessarily. could spread weeks becoming symptomatic? half stay asymptomatic still overall high fatality rate. we're way it. sad.  Thank typing out, I'm tired attempting explain people can't ""bring manufacturing jobs back"" made threshold entrance high. company develop (morals aside) product another country fractions cost avoid strict labor safety laws incentive come back. They'd invest billions build factories train people order create product. Alright. I‚Äôm tired winning.

They weren't. estimated 160 million Americans either obese overweight. Nearly three-quarters American men 60% women obese overweight. also major challenges America‚Äôs children ‚Äì nearly 30% boys girls age 20 either obese overweight, 19% 1980.

And that‚Äôs considering respiratory disease (like asthma nearly 10% adults suffer from), immunodeficiency (which also side effect chemotherapy), cardiovascular disease, age. granted, there‚Äôs going major overlap populations comorbidities think it‚Äôs easy see 75% relatively conservative estimate proportion US population underlying condition. Again? guys never proper lockdown start with. One population millions.

Oh ever do. countries like Czech Republic broken groupthink making grassroots projects make distribute cloth masks nationwide)

Oh, worry. country stopped giving fuck months ago. y'all know situation Czech right now? baaaad getting wooooorse. need wear masks whole summer, cause ""too hot"". course, think country super prepared start would keep wearing masks social distancing voluntarily right? Lol nope! Even now, new restrictions place since start September (due exponential growth late July August), half people masks pulled noses, see least one person without mask like 75% time. Look comments, raging coronavirus lockdowns. Move along. China Uighur re-education camps, commits numerous human rights violations, safe say lie COVID cases. India relatively poor country, doubt anyone tested. doubt India would intentionally lie cases, resources accurate count like US. western countries obviously US worst, definitely worst world. He's hold another in-door rally without masks week. hell fault. Hes suppose lead example protect American people, act like reckless lying deranged idiot. knew dangerous was, lied numerous people died. notice say WHO, forget Saint (and perennial fellatio target) Fauci too...

I get downvoted time mention that. Check septic tank! critically lied Fauci, god sub, fucking reason. Dogma, science, post.

Edit: Bonus points instantly going ad hominem banner scientific rigor lol Gullible morons. Denouncing isnt enough point. calling violence 2a people rise up? breaking rules - I'm sure tell respect arbitrary authority.

You think businesses able set rules store/website? think individuals able homes, lockdown measures quantify two things: first, many deaths/long-term effects prevent, second, short- long-term costs measures are. demonstrate former greater latter.

You using vague statements. 

What, exactly, would convince you. post studies, saying, sounds like dismiss them. 

So what, exactly (like, methodology) would accept? possible, even theory, ever convince you? GO BUCKS Haha, obvious raging behind computer screen hiding ""lol"" vain attempt get skin.

So pathetic laughable honestly.

You literally provided extra sources proved wrong. even look results LMGTFY. Haha

Man would embarrassed you. Self owns pretty rare treat watch person. Also said original post millions students don‚Äôt exist, thus acknowledging sarcasm parenthesis Look happened toilet paper Orangitis hell sickness. Unfortunately, think Americans would actually wear masks/stay home/work together covid Ebola-like symptoms. Admittedly, covid smart virus cause right kind havoc. think created lab, scares someone want make something lab, covid great example.  really. 15'000 deaths mere 2%. Sars-Cov back 2003 death ratio 14/15%. flu I‚Äôm tired articles like this. state-by-state thing, one-size-fits-all. NJ NY, well places like VT, flattened curves need close again. Fauci underestimate masks - lied cover gov's lack proper preparation.

I'll never understand idolization Fauci. nerve say he's ""his man"" bend specific administrations.  Excellent point. 1918 ‚ÄúSpanish‚Äù Flu epidemic started Kansas. We‚Äôve got nothing brag about. 

China‚Äôs source virus undisputed reputable scientists. However, conspiracy theory created lab pernicious falsehood ***must*** combated every thinking American dangerous, especially hands espousing it. Well would credibility right actually listened science leg stand on. anti science party really like science. amount red flags entire thing numerous plenty.

Also fox stated many time news organization entertainment organization. It‚Äôs fucking halfway September medical field still doesn‚Äôt PPE, stance doesn‚Äôt hold lot weight. worst worlds. Sanders state..... duh! Well federal government stepped gave safety net didn‚Äôt businesses fight pandemic loss profits own. another symptom massive failure leadership national level. doesnt take highly educated person

Lots stupid well-off people here. seem direct connection smarts money. value masks... I'm still puzzled fauci. know even Trump knew. wanted believe he's lost trust. They're morons, they're attached idea chosen God therefore impervious plague Social media? No, CDC, WHO, Fauci, straight lied us early on. them, (e.g. Fauci) even admitted openly preserve medical mask supply. What's going social media partly due that, also less important initial screw up. actually important figure real origin virus, though, China exactly transparent.

I think there's credible evidence ""weaponized virus"" anything sort mean ""come lab"". Accidents happen labs, even BSL4 labs, time. Pathogens get out. much common people probably think.

Unfortunately discussion topic anathema places gets roasted ""conspiracy theory"" ""racist propaganda"" even nothing sort. Kristian Anderson article *Nature Medicine* taken general ""proof"" natural zoonotic origin via lots speculation pangolins, even though seems [discarded pangolin theory discussion topic: Yea except right worry people panic buying none healthcare professionals valid concern... mean look people toilet paper ffs. masses behave like morons. 

The problem wasn‚Äôt WHO‚Äôs flip flop here, leaders (like trump) downplayed whole time, refused use defense production act, still downplay use masks date.

Your outrage misplaced here. correct. Trump try shut borders one point got attacked that? shutting borders WOULD correct way stop pandemic. good point. Trump rightfully getting share blame this, April face coverings became mandatory New York.

I'm medical expert, started keeping scarf face bus February/March told work home. already asked work home due asthma granted permission, told everyone work home.  


I figured nothing else, scarf would protect common cold help bolster immunity flu shot.

DeBlasio telling people worry public transit early March That‚Äôs exactly reason believe yelling terrible flu season going absolutely false majority people wearing masks believe one mildest flu seasons record one else western democratic world able to

Except Germany, New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, Norway ... Right western nations like US saber rattling China decade fueling idea war inevitable. People totally covering protect China! ""China pay"" pandemic backwards shortsighted logic imaginable.

If **you** know anybody made afraid emotional reasons, kindly point there's absolutely nothing afraid of, **as long they're ignoring facts presented them**.

Hopefully **doing same, conduct choices.**  seem every ""WHO Expert"" alarmist? Also, messaging god awful every step way told you, death percentage. zero excuse US many deaths high death percentage.

Then question effective first approved vaccines be. FDA said accept 50% effectiveness. Unless scientific miracle happens something around 90% effectiveness even elders happens people still need masks etc.

some argued likely spread vaccinated first medical workers tendancy older people less response vaccination. wonder country go route especially 50-60s weak response vaccine. funny thing is, would shut NOTHING, would better. I‚Äôve learned *conservatives fucking stupid fuck*.

Since least stores businesses already taking precautions Coronavirus masks, gloves, windows registers, one less worrisome flu seasons awhile theory.

Technically would really great less intrusive precautions like windowed registers stayed place year round mask mandate came back every flu season, probably save number lives. think underguesstimated, overguesstimate. Real world data still extremely scarce. E.g. recent article NYC data seemed try separate effects distancing mask mandate, using time series alone (without natural control).

No one contests masks effective, every variable kept same. question is: big effect actually small compared measures (such physical distancing) could even risk net negative people stand 1m apart wearing masks instead 2m apart without? situations distancing hard impossible (such public transport), question remains - people would walked taken car, figure probably risk taking train wear mask? person would better without mask walking, instead train mask. Yes course mask better mask train, that's meaningless comparison. precious little data risk shifting, worse, probably dependent population studied. I'm sorry hear that.

Then Swedes general always pretty good social distancing even pandemic saying fine 200k people died mostly old people. Okay, well that's one stand point guess.  guess chance mask use least partially responsible shorter times hospital fewer hospitalizations.

People need accept island helps, government listens scientists rather corporations unselfish culture matters wayyyyy quality mask make big difference, surgical masks effective filtration fabric ones, make sure wear properly (nose wire fitted well, etc) try estimate risk different variables. Probably saw people snatching toilet paper like lives depended it. Imagine Americans would done case masks literally understood lives depended them. visited sub much since then. Sadly looks like filled tons anti-maskers taking advantage poor journalism shake people's trust actual experts. feel like trust experts anymore conspiracies seem less crazy.

‚ÄúCDC testing guidelines

If well, don‚Äôt get tested.

If sick, don‚Äôt get tested.‚Äù I‚Äôve seen NYC. seen credible sources say 40%, seen many say 40%-60% range likely achieve herd immunity. degree herd ""resistance"" first becomes visible around low 20s.

I think know experts drifting away 70%-80% range, simple math done achieve numbers assumes everyone equally susceptible contracting C19, something know true. cross protection coronaviruses, blood type, vitamin deficiency, behavioral patterns, etc... found many variables would change someone's susceptibility. 

You're correct expert thinks full blown herd immunity occurs 40%. Many people mistake resistance shown places like NYC Stockholm. they're actually full immunity, maybe seeing first effects. 

This good news though. 40-60% much easier hit infections partially effective vaccine 70-80% would be. heres crazy idea encourage WFH actual sick pay people flu stay fuck home infect half office *second age depends are.

In Wyoming social ending hasbeen fully embraced.  Source? Aka people aren‚Äôt listening ‚Äúlockdown forever‚Äù crowd anymore blame Sweden Nah, need tests good throwing ball. get one every day. remember reading Miami around 20%. probably expect threshold lower lower population density anyways. progress truthful reporting? Yes interventions (NPIs) social distancing positive effects economy, limiting spikes infections avoiding mass study economic impact 1918 Spanish Flu US found cities implemented early extensive NPIs suffered adverse economic effects medium intervened earlier aggressively actually experienced relative increase real economic activity pandemic I‚Äôm sorry, what? asked question average age death...? would elicit emotional response like that? curious average age death? can‚Äôt even curious ask scientific question specific statistic? sneaky shit brother one people. tried tell me, straight mailed couple boxes surgical masks, didn‚Äôt quite get beginning.

Champ. Ignorance indeed bliss. Taiwan Sweden's actions virus like total opposite. Again? locked like 6 days first time!   Welcome back. Took L first time since March week.

No, research doesn‚Äôt demonstrate that. *unproven theory* put forward researchers, intensity illness affected amount you‚Äôre exposed virus. three months ago, bought 2 boxes (50 total) surgical masks family use. Surgical masks far effective cloth masks, studies show.
 virus lives surfaces 3 days. easy rotate out, keep ones I've already used car. Texas heat sun adds another layer safety killing viruses. That, I'm throwing away vital masks one use each. live North Texas virus rampant, toddler protect, two therefore cannot feasibly wear mask. Nobody household immediate family gotten sick. feel much protected cloth masks. wore cloth masks first 3-4 months virus outbreak. definitely better nothing. Unfortunately, hard breathe Texas summer minutes. tried using workshop disposable towels added layer protection made harder breathe. family, best solution yet. 
Of course, masks social distancing. Getting creative spending time inside house taking lots walks.

I see clerk, see woman adjust mask entered aisle. able see clerk was, would air fived way store. Guys, found stalker. narrative makes sense surface, we're really talking massive lack intelligence. us remember news 2003, respect Asian approach mask-wearing general.

I get saying, need stop nice work ahead admit problem: democracy full ignorant majority Lol, media politicians acting like virus I'm sarcastic. I'm using Melbourne example place ""did right"" subreddit's standards, businesses still ended suffering.

You might agree government now, IMO Australians completely submitted state's authority. There's turning back that. I'd rather live ""disaster zone"" like Sweden Florida country government decide whim arrest people making Facebook posts, going outside 5km radius home, going outside longer 60 minutes, peacefully protesting. mean, people?! appreciate taking time reply going reptile brain mode like commenters honestly I'm really virtual stuff, think anyone really honest, especially. even play video games refuse actually think massive waste time money. 

The technology virtual meetups though. even close viable substitute person human interaction imo. tech surely evolving quickly think like 20 years. I'm sure people industry would better analysis tech clearly there, honestly really want live world that's reality that'd like shit straight matrix live VR boxes something. 

Anyway, obvious solution go party's anyway, 80% people doing, included. avoid posting online however lot nazi cdc shills living among us unfortunately. Keep mind I'm NY. We've extremely strict lockdowns since like march. Also around 500 new cases per day past weeks daily death counts never exceeded 10. clearly spike colleges opening people partying. We'll see happens winter ig * Americans mental fortitude it.

* Americans money saved able ... large part right first time thus never got chance bounce back economically. Well zombie apocalypse expecting, I'll take it! Yeah even South Korea imposing lockdowns. virus joke nobody solved 100%. countries far better others though. actually really upsetting me. consolation well-developed pharmaceutical manufacture infrastructure vaccine treatment made public, ought able crank pretty rapidly. 

It really testament well they've done taken long hit numbers like this. Even back January, India biggest covid fear, what's actually panned anywhere near scenario made mind. Massive means 11%?

Considering country runs blood money, see possible scheme keep products selling, artificially increasing price time.

Not saying want people safe, wear masks, seek vaccine available...

I'm saying wary seek profit everything. shown lives health come second making money.  agree US needs work I‚Äôm going return normal vaccine President said wrong I'm inclined believe CDC diretor. Short article, entire (Reuters) - China United Arab Emirates seen positive results Phase III COVID-19 vaccine trials, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told news briefing Beijing United Arab Emirates Monday granted emergency approval use coronavirus vaccine, six weeks human trials Gulf Arab state started. talking about? what‚Äôs point? Say something meaningful. obese, 70+ year old president? Hard say done with. can. It‚Äôs decided aren‚Äôt. public hasn‚Äôt asked. Spot Yeah right...moving Many well underway results may expected cases next month. 11. Thank sharing, pressure drop? Well, really get complacent either. Especially right winter spike. rich nation Greece best score Europe till mid June, doors opened tourism. 2nd wave started late July August, government thought devastated economy could worse disaster people dying covid19, score taking dive Greece climbed 110th position 85th (total cases covid19). Public transport, airports, schools, commercial activity on, except night life/entertainment Athens area suspended two weeks, masks mandated public areas.

But mask use used religiously, people/employees grocery stores hang around chin avoid ticket many really using them. 
The rates 1300/mil infected, 30/mil died, 67 currently ICU, total capacity 190 units. Athens capacity 85% utilized, probably exceeded early next week given rates continue 2 week trends. 

Rate wise Greece may something brag still, 2.5% daily increase new cases current level ICU capacity Greece verge disaster government nothing stop it.

Greece recovered 10% economic crisis started 11 years ago. beggining year two ago, faced 30% deficit due lockdown Spring devastating tourist season ever. Go it, understand risks all. Could end long term heart damage like did. Sweden go herd immunity. 

Using word pogrom hyperbolic. gotten tested? Wait it, Trump going get COVID stroke early October I'll wearing mask public work long time. 

And I'll probably always wear one flu season now. Asia right idea. Maybe whenever I've seen read vaccines one challenges always producing enough everyone. That's fiction idea accurate real life trope even reading manufacturing process vaccines yesterday makes certain amount sense. sure. *some* people buy corporate system work. think people would understand duality system. Maybe I‚Äôm overestimating people think knows? lol Sure, nearly pervasive elsewhere cases still fell like rock numbers (estimated actual, concrete confirmed) got around 20%. keeps happening best route take, all, good news going forward. 

Especially vaccine 8ish weeks away, there's reason keep wearing masks keep gatherings limited. change people playing loosey-goosey distancing months ago made harder virus passed today, numbers indicate effect. fact they're rounding muslims placing camps

That's bit much lie. like modi RSS India crazy western media potrays.

Two crazy states crazy leaders exist India that's Bihar. Everywhere else pretty mild. clearly don't. understand population India lot larger US, right?  problem sounds good!

And anyone else reading - ladies gentlemen, hope paying attention. present 2020 strain bots. election cycle comes ""I actually one skeptical"" effectively voluntary completely unenforceable... packed gym London. don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre well. USA #1 again! air pollution literally toxic asians. 

They also wear filtered masks exactly nothing virus. course, continue like. think majority people actually going follow restrictions another year, think you‚Äôre bit touch.

It‚Äôs nice you‚Äôre enjoying yourself, nope, sure mental health hold another year restrictions. That‚Äôs kind trying get at‚Äî restrictions also negative public health effects. makes ‚Äúwimp‚Äù, sure, absolutely ‚Äúwimp‚Äù hahaha. deny reality negative mental health effects restrictions, actually interested promoting public health whole can‚Äôt take seriously.  American propaganda machine (big business) fucking effective get away touting Sweden country aimed herd immunity legitimize inaction American government. Big business god damn focused cash ran propaganda caused 100k+ people die save dozen people collectively worth trillion dollars couple billion.  super fair, fines usually capped much per incident can‚Äôt fine someone isn‚Äôt law consequence fine under. Usually fines aren‚Äôt dependent value business either, jacking fines puts little guys business.

If want business (and employees) suffer, boycott them. end you‚Äôll hurt little guy though probably even makes dent. mean like Spain, Italy, Belgium? saying debate. point saying ""noone claimed Sweden things perfectly"" say one side debate nuanced.

The other... well regurgitating constant falsehoods Sweden tried [herd immunity]

And ""position"" talk deaths per capita every Spring every sentence cannot explain oh chaotic strategy low rates moment increasing (at least compared rest Europe moment). Perhaps cause yoyo-ing daily lives maintained steady social distanced strategy entire time relatively sustainable us continue do. none seems matter ""Sweden bad"" crowd. constantly say is: ""Sweden bad.""

But otherwise, basically ignored every point made kept hammering classic points ""Sweden bad"" crowd. fellow Aussie expat living Sweden, please label us like that. one I'm glad got opportunity weather storm Sweden, opposed Australia. vaccine thing what‚Äôs point mask? [insert shameless COYG!] I'm physician. I'm going continue use mask long time vaccination, well continue physically distance. may consider lower risk activities like outside dining restaurant, little grocery shopping person rather internet, eating inside restaurant going movie long time. Surprise surprise...It pointed early reporting method obviously going make numbers look better. Fucking disgraceful standard.  point need strong unified national leadership general feeling things like distancing masking patriotic duty every american

No. [See thoughts masks Whether masks work, know they're 100% effective. inexcusable allow non-essential businesses stay open masks, since they're still *non-essential* opportunities COVID spread. Either virus severe must shut everything down, willing allow spread long hospitals overwhelmed. Masks completely made-up middle ground never considered.

And even national mask mandate, tell right people currently wear masks gonna change time soon. Public opinion masks improving. national mandate either means mass non-compliance monumental enforcement effort. okay arresting fining people wearing masks, right complain selective enforcement excessive police authority. agree everything said. vaccine thing what‚Äôs point mask? No, definitely is. proper Spanish slang Spanish. like proper English Slang English. That's part social ending. accept precautions move on. constantly hunker homes avoid interaction. Masks, sanitizer, social distancing, limiting public exposure, etc becomes part live every day. get point stopping precautions pandemic fatigue and/or see others caring much more. genuine question: everyone need vaccinated order us go back normal go back normal much sooner? vulnerable healthcare workers get vaccinated early next year, substantial amount people already immunity, can‚Äôt go back normal since hospitalizations ICU beds down? normal, mean gatherings friends family, necessarily concerts sporting events. Wouldn‚Äôt risk contagion reduced enough safe? Till Death (from Covid) us part.  ...Unless created accident. probably masks thing Scandinavia last month so, argument really work city secretly gyms open much earlier city officials, rest gym-goers employees told pound sand People still saying this?

Dude, question whether vaccine anymore. several likely candidates. question distribution now. someone cancer may likely die something like car accident. might able get way time. No, news said hospitals overwhelmed ball game. Turns wasn‚Äôt. See movies. Ent√£o e Avante em Portugal, n√£o conta?
What Avante Portugal? count? Save speculation vaccine actually available public Eh?

We're phase 3 bunch vaccines, that. figured get people afraid leaving house think they‚Äôll think way get back outside. ‚ÄúNobody wants guinea pig, we‚Äôre going see that, morons France announced new high average age Covid deaths higher age death general population, generally throws age calculation oldest. Generally speaking special, complication disease deadly group. Stated another way, group also top dying walking stairs, minor car accidents, etc...(Not helpful stat)

If want extremely strict believe morbid obesity actually highest (vs obese), unless reference otherwise? That's perspective. Maybe, commenter said, princess-y one.

Not all; sounds like keeping eye trying reckon burdens might place you. Thank sharing, hope resolved soon (somehow) things improve everyone.

I'm curious keep saying soon *have* give masks keeping modest distance people else they'll just... *something*. want know something is, they've reached conclusion, think going maskless heedless personal space solve it. Yes, even basic understanding economics you‚Äôd realise halting 11% economy would catastrophic effects parts economy rely too, banks restaurants. 

Stop running away potential consequences lockdowns travel restrictions. it. biggest issues schools opening ridiculous. Kids going infect infect parents infect even people, make effort 1 year online classes? Yes sucked improve way better destroying progress we've made far potential kill thousands people kids ''normal'' school days/months (until eventually realize fucked big time forced close them)

I can't understand would ever open schools...... we're going back lock that's sure. 

Probably something discussing reddit since americans still struggling understand masks good virus propaganda conspiracy control us I'll able discuss group friday wanted type get chest. absolute shit-ton pro-lockdowners say exactly that. schadenfreude sub every time supposed skeptic dies comes COVID news charts. even people saying ""serves right"" anti-masker's wife died COVID - even dude.

I try maintain balanced perspective honestly seen many people saying going mental illness lost jobs businesses deserve supported restrictions. vaccines prevent infection. small trial monkeys Oxford vaccine not, however. Oh, sorry. science degree computer science. read article need ELI5 myself. guy First Class looks like Jon Stewart It‚Äôs ‚Äúcaring‚Äù exactly. It‚Äôs failing define objective clearly. one knows exactly trying whatever. Still leadership failure, different kind. 6 many, apprentice xmas. We'll nice roast, drink eggnog, open presents front fire (I hope get new robe, Kyber crystals). Meanwhile America's president blaming Biden mandating masks Biden's presidency. 

....    guy lot political pressure open state let run rampant. valued life money trying keep health system collapsing. Missing cases increases spread still arent testing/contact tracing enough catch it.  Small business got killed virus lockdowns. let everyone wanted, whole world would Florida right now. really weird point everything open totally unsustainable almost nobody profiting.

I owned business corona closed industry won‚Äôt recover several years vaccine exists. losing money open, that‚Äôs good. doesn‚Äôt matter made profit last year spent years building business red foreseeable future.  POS still around? earth appeal? haaland autopsys: that's exactly herd immunity works. 

Herd immunity supposed involve vaccine. 

There's lot miscommunication exactly herd immunity is. equation ^ reflecting it. Huh? point mainstream religions often require suppression logical thought, thereby affecting decision making process. Even new President elected - impossible new guy much trend. damage already done....
I recall press conference Trump said: keep deaths 190.000 done great job.... looking Germany's numbers - 9000+ that's already failure.... finally dies Jr. sworn totally legitimate election.  u/undeleteparent chicken tastes like chicken. remember thinking ‚Äúhe‚Äôs saying absurd number look good it‚Äôs lower that‚Äù time thought unlikely higher.  know set loose. know Chinese people would competent enough prevent spread virus forced silence CCP. looking Taiwan's response hints world would looked like governed democratic transparent government.

I know set loose, know intentionally let spread ones economically hit it, totalitarian regime would resort this. ""I change mind. to, I'm American. change mind anything, regardless facts set me. I'm dug in, I'll never change.""
 
Always Sunny, always relevant Actually, COVID cause heart attacks. trust doctors medical examiners truthful death certificate licenses line. CDC recommendations supposed follow COVID pretty simple excess deaths follow positive COVID infection tests couple weeks, exactly would expect. basically one third world's population

No, quite. crap you‚Äôre spewing religious people acting irrelevant. Non-religious people also live bubble don‚Äôt act empathy well. Brazil: hold beer people distance using masks people wear correctly. Also seems people get infected home work. That's guess Sad downvoted post covid 19 sub. shows exactly America fetid swamp covid death rest world moves on. almost entirely 18 year old men, people would care lot more. It‚Äôs largely overweight people elderly, folks lot people don‚Äôt care about. That‚Äôs reality situation. [And much steeper slope :( That's empathy, religion need suppress logical thought required. makes worse GOP right whingers blame Biden moment office (if gets obviously) number accurate, proven tests faulty people went hospital ailments died claimed covid. That's works. That's works. New York twice population New Jersey. states hit pretty hard. I‚Äôve always thought least crazy shit happening right covid rage zombies.  Ever since pandemic started, keep announcing 1 month closure extending it. think know border open least next summer.  People stupid sometimes. I‚Äôm left 200k largely elderly overweight people older 18 year old kids getting blown trenches fighting war, Jesus guys.

Edit: Blast downvotes, would love type coherent argument could put two page. like leftist version something see Fox News; makes personally embarrassed side. Could really simple? Spanish super social, making social distance would hard guess.

As well France Spain lot people comply much regulations. 

Lived France, people park block entrance hospital middle street, blocking traffic, like ""RELAX CRAZY IDIOTS!"" come back move car everybody yelling get way.  USA! USA! tantalizing finding, medicine also appeared reduce patients‚Äô odds ending hospital. 1.7% patients received drug, called LY-CoV555, eventually went emergency room hospitalized, compared 6% took placebo. amounts 72% relative reduction risk.

If check local expat groups, find scores people denied tests despite showing symptoms.

If it: breathing exercises. Three different kinds exercises. 

One kind activating parasympathetic nervous system little normal breathing exercises. 
You breathe roughly 4-5 seconds preferably nose hover slightly. breathe mouth least 6-7 second - longer better. 50 breaths 2-4 times day roughly 10-20 minutes. 

The kind breathing exercise breathing much air possible. Hover slightly exhaling air keep pressure keep exhaling breath feel like going cough cough. would suggest 10 times morning evening. 

The third deep even breaths couple minutes. Inhale deep exhale deep. 

The breathing exercises help clear phlegm lower blood pressure loosen blood vessels, help circulation clear nitrous oxide body 

You could try find supplement made herb perilla frutenceses, herb like mint. also locally called shiso dual use food medicine.

I've seen, nearly impossible find pharmaceutical oxycodone, means nearly pills presses fent anologues. God bless America Nordic countries managed without masks, seem simple. Social distancing key. Well, one thing say Trump, always keeps promises. definitely tired winning.

The reporter insisted speaking louder end trump managed answer question anyway.

[Here's 2 million people died US pandemic.

2 million Coronavirus? Check facts bub. like 200k. Every one tragedy.

I'm glad callously look life calculation. know 99% world population could perish humans could still rebound. 99% lives matter, according ""calculations"". true. care lot richest citizens. Ok. 300x population New Zealand, 20 cities larger entire population NZ. what? Mine refuse believe even 50,000 Covid currently. ""people die every year anyways"". building won‚Äôt allow visitors, indefinite. set first provincial government government mandated, re-inforced building management. Then, independant city within large Canadian city bylaws regulations things large posters. Masks mandatory everywhere building except personal apartment. moved July haven‚Äôt met anyone yet due anti-soc√Æal rules. Also, tenants allowed visit other. One person elevator once. Food delivery curb side.... exceptions made humanitarian reasons (you‚Äôre dying) emergency (heart attack, fire...).

The rules listed indefinite. second wave first one never stops. Uncle sugar giving much money going tons fraud. hope catch majority them. Uk next overtaken. Eventually even overtake Spain. Take fishing. Left alone nature! number? ""responsible dictator"" lmao. dictator bad. USA even overtake Spain point. It‚Äôs catching month now. think latest end October. Unless number dead Spain increases way beyond now. old medic abuse news.

want old news works; learn earlier year NYC acute covid management protocols like low pressure passive O2, posturing, reflexes chiropractic conservative strategies.  arrogant (and grotesquely unchristian) dick. hope everyone sues shit him. 1.4 billion virus serious shit, headlines pure fear mongering. 
I'm thankful could much worse, imagine death rate 10% instead 1%. image child affected. Yes, that's huge different dying Covid. 6% died US died Covid, 94% major pre-existing conditions. Basically lot could gave little push edge (it's unfortunate that's life works).  Imagine America wasn‚Äôt great. Well duh, USA tests. There's gonna deaths /s Even vaccine still think going see tons people social distancing wearing mask long time. Germany one US compared to? need ""willing"", need enforcement. yeet simplified terms, particles get past filtration ""sneaking"" ""holes"" web charged fibers, draw particles closer in. particles (mainly dust) get caught fibers, ""holes"" become plugged up. result, fewer ""holes"" particles sneak through. course, next hit next biggest challenge - pressure drop associated this. 

This true *all* filtration media, general trend. We've replicated trend labs. Unfortunately specific data release. 11.8% last time untrue. US 11th deaths per capita calculation quite basic. worth rob 300 million people 1+ years lives order extend couple hundred thousand lives years? Around 2 million people died US pandemic. last 6 months robbed well. Shut dribble That's apparently irrelevant people. Pre-existing conditions..aka lot shit going kill sooner later anyway. Covid sped process up. Social distancing eats masks breakfast. 

(But combination, together washing hands frequently properly even better) Wife playing EQ2 bit more. good time level alts burn free time. don‚Äôt want Covid, stay home. Dude, there's pandemic. Stop whining. hard everyone. That's logical. know belong reddit. go outside run take dogs walking. hiking trails pretty sparse go peak times. I'm disagreeing general argument, #'s.

34% American homeowners mortgage debt (paid bought cash).

Same report said 150m homes mortgages. clear meant 150m homes analyzed 150m (76%) mortgages. 

Either way, definitely 5% unless include kids.

Non-paywall WP article: Believing something believing possible two different things.

I believe possible. Absolutely.

But think know enough believe came lab, that's becomes conspiracy theory. kidding me? entire thing based headline? 

The headline said NZ's biggest GDP fall. Well, that's also true countries fully lock down. taht tells us nothing. countries 200k deaths, better. 

Hell, headline, NZ could still done even better economically countries contained virus. 

You citing mere headline, give numbers comparison countries, evidence tells trying real, honest conversation this. Trump responsible Bezos?

Perhaps Germany (or cant) enforce quarantine US military personnel come spread Thanks idea! Might work. 100%. wasn‚Äôt WHO. US Surgeon General even Fauci culpable well. Remember gems?:

‚ÄúIf look masks buy drug store, leakage around really much protect you. People start saying, 'Should start wearing mask?' Now, United States, absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask."" - Dr. Anthony Fauci, February 2020

‚ÄúYou increase risk getting wearing mask health care provider‚Äù - US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, March 2020

If people still confused mask effectiveness distrusting anything government health officials say right now, why.

People try excuse behavior say didn‚Äôt know masks effective back February March. categorically false. Multiple studies done demonstrating efficacy masks, even simple surgical cloth masks, preventing spread viruses. showed masks effective protecting others wearer, increased protection wearer well. research clear far find, exactly zero studies ever shown masks increase risk getting virus (or virus). show opposite. coordinated campaign flagrant conscious lying nearly every public health official - people we‚Äôre supposed able trust. Don‚Äôt let hook let rewrite history. Pulling following link, college students seem listed ‚Äúcritical population‚Äù:

 People increased risk acquiring transmitting COVID-19:

 People racial ethnic minority People tribal People incarcerated/detained correctional facilities People experiencing homelessness/living People attending People work educational settings (e.g., early learning centers, schools, and
colleges/universities)

EDIT: Formatting. backlog dumps got stop. Yesterday Virginia dumped 96 Ohio dumped 82. redistributed dates occurred, create false trend Yeah, see sure. It‚Äôs annoying disingenuous people say CDC misleading purpose. 

They always clear reasons. First, said save medical personnel symptomatic folks could self-isolate. 

Then, CDC explained changed back April, following study asymptomatic spreading, public mask policy increased importance relative need save medical pros. US topped 100k end May. ~3 months makes feel better done things since February, even though can. Would still rather play safe. Sorry follow science. tell quickly vaccine distributed approved covid vaccine going solve covid, yes, covid vaccine going solve climate change. I‚Äôm aware evidence climate change increase number pandemics. give source one, it‚Äôs interesting thought. Still unclear climate change = never getting back normal relates covid restrictions. Maybe mean never getting back climate ‚Äúnormal‚Äù? Yeah I‚Äôd agree framing ""good"" vs ""bad"" college kids completely mark. College social experience much educational experience-- perhaps even so! many lifelong friends met college, memorable experiences. blame one iota social fun.

The blame lies squarely administrations colleges welcomed students created unwieldy, unrealistic policies standards order acquire tuition money. Single-handedly funding projects wipe malaria* ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care long get exactly want want it! Meeeeee!‚Äù  yet using mask since day 1, dumb think otherwise. long for? 2 years? 3?  started wearing shit popular! hospital workers wearing something face, I'm wearing something face too. can't tell hospital workers scared particulate be. note, buy N95s beginning, understood hospital works would need enough. Ended making 1000 cloth masks family distributing free anyone wanted them. pandemic still going finish renovations, I'll get back making masks, though seem like demand finally filled better great! really matter neighbors take it. get it, intents purposes, life back normal. Vaccine skeptics get fucked. Check covid1984film.net (it‚Äôs satire) Exactly. west acting like SARS thing. There's tons real world evidence available laymen SARS combatted, say nothing available government experts. 

Add fact coronaviruses well studied. ""Not knowing airborne transmission"" sheer lunacy vaccine comes go back normal life. impose everybody? top that, efficacy claims early strictly aimed preventing contracting virus, mitigating transmission others. 

We also wanted people horde masks early (remember toilet paper idiots)so medical personnel run ppe. 

Lastly, even now, despite clinical evidence, world governments apprehensive recognize virus airborne. That's closer lie anything masks. I'm blaming partiers partying... make numbers time then?  Damn 8th last week, keep falling ~~I support herd immunity, fair force dichotomy ""flatten curve herd immunity"". One want both, achievable.~~

replied wrong comment. track trace unworkable practice. outbreak going long they're worried now?

It's almost large number people would act reckless ignore warnings infection spread regardless informing them. That's true Belgium, country.

Also none us leave homes one person know can‚Äôt leave home? Honestly, sound fair you?  33 years

Yeah, no. don‚Äôt think author‚Äôs intentionally disingenuous, analysis he‚Äôs making ignores ton factors, including batshit governors law enforcement giving two shits things like lockdown/mask compliance. Sweden, ifs blunders, ran things general poorly here, it‚Äôs Mad Max, ‚Äòoops, guess didn‚Äôt work.‚Äô It‚Äôs also funny Reason brings social democratic state that‚Äôs anathema beliefs point comparison. thank much. pointing missed instead condescending Philippines made masks gloves mandatory early on. there. they've made face shields plus mask plus gloves mandatory.

I came back Canada like hell BS. keep 6 feet distance wash hands? Really?

Then months later made masks mandatory.

It still going Philippines far higher population density. I've listening Osterholm since started podcast Youtube. He's favorite go perspective pandemic. advocate complete shutdown. Obviously, rural Montana need shutdown. 

To clear, I'm advocating shutdown, Osterholm's recommendations misconstrued here.  social restrictions, announced biggest ever fall GPD, Covid still festering there. Tell ""perfect policy"" well. TLDR: lot people saying 100% certainty naturally mutated virus, yet provide proof. Again, again, again. proof proven???

I'm making claims... ZERO, I'm saying still debate burden proof yet met either side click-baity headlines twitter posts. I'm operating default assumption skepticism proven true. Thanks! That‚Äôs interesting know got result 12 hours. don‚Äôt know places taking long,  maybe Russia far ahead testing compared ""more developed nations""?

Unfortunately rather large number nutjobs wearing them. Speak Bill, never underestimated value masks. 149 deaths reported Basque Country alone, looks like come backlog. However, daily deaths Spain increasing could possibly see 100 per day soon. I‚Äôm high risker unpopular post weekend feels high risk knowing antivaxxers probably going ruin everyone drag us take precautions. It‚Äôs getting really depressing think about, assholes likely going force us issues continue hide another 1-2 years til things come combined people willing get vaccine. don‚Äôt see way normal next year, say means lot us health issues. Yea social distancing matter, don‚Äôt wash hands wear mask 

We didn‚Äôt get herd immunity let everyone wear mask spread virus, natural nice. Thank volunteering. important part making sure thing works intended. legally allowed discuss potential side effects?

South Korea also pretty aggressive contact tracing? think might risky associate strict lock-downs contact-tracing authoritarianism (same way idiots USA associate wearing mask freedom) infections happen places close together longer amount time. Wearing mask fuck case. saying it, internal policy every hospital Netherlands wearing mask required virtually nothing. 

Cases going people get fed wasting lives. parties things. Masks use case. Ouch. know shut borders China, little late (we tons travel China even outbreak there. shut sorts loopholes.

So pretty much thing even got partially correct, still royally screwed up. combat kinds problems highlighting here, robust well established peer review system scientists work vetted large, diverse array scientists world, hitting general public misinformation could grave often irreparable harm.

Understanding decision mean agreeing it.

They framed A) health care workers PPE B) civilians PPE. thought strategy minimize civilian demand lower competition limited supply. 

They either think disregarded C) asking people use PPE endorsing makeshift masks thought people would still go PPE. 

Given choice A) B), understandable civilians could use many measures avoid covid health care workers luxury avoiding infected people, require fewer masks outfitting civilians backbone health care system. Dear Bill, 

Stay lives. 

Sincerely, 

America lockdown way stop it‚Äôs widespread. early, outbreak could contained testing teaching isolating requires testing capability many places don‚Äôt have. Literally first article page: ""premium"" story, headline says all. ""NZ's biggest fall GDP"". thought entire point ""lockdown hard fast, strict track trace"" avoid kind thing. keep beating evil government that. Apologies. every state treating pandemic like Vermont, things would practically normal would lot less deaths. guy everything right still admits he's wrong, damn G. guess schools avoid Federal fines this, like meat plants did. I'm married 3 daughters. toilet paper usage INSANE. stay home 100% time.

That ethics talking about.  DeathSantis also forced county reopen schools threatening pull millions funding didn't. Yeah gave months ago personally. evidence transmission delivery items seems pretty slim. Still bad idea order groceries take out! We‚Äôll rocking Remember dumb motherfuckers said 'heat' summer would kill virus? Yeah fuckers even admit wrong make excuses ignorance. Damn, we‚Äôre killin it. America hit 325k year even assume winter affect spread.

107 days left year rolling 7 day average 800/day (that's also including fact there's already 265k excess deaths year surprised see 350k christmas) Winter hasn‚Äôt even begun. School starting up. Dumb family get togethers.... gon gr8 Wasn‚Äôt 160,000 last month? according excess death data around start pandemic, nationally death count undercounted 50%. means real death count believe current excess death count also currently manipulated therefore can't presumed reliable 2020 1/2 flu season. thus far. 1918 pandemic US started around April 1918 went summer 1919; year three waves. Much less season prolonged engagement. first year covid yet. count start US covid engagement mid Feb-March, we're 6-7 months it. There's still time catch up. likely catch up? Hopefully not. count chickens quite yet. Wow....i think lost r politics. Wisconsin literally one thing: cheese. seeing average death age appears average American's life expectency. Still tragic, exactly picture trying paint. Race yet. Brazil India going try top spot. okay family says they're homeless people old folks. Coming people upper 60s... We‚Äôre #1! Suicides increasing, well people losing access meds heart conditions, well malnutrition diseases people smaller cities unable travel larger cities specialized treatment on.

So 200k dead covid extra deaths occuring too, pandemic killed many fold usual. Ooh ooh add comorbidity numbers! bad news: beds meds many people. Better dust hospital ships sail to... St. Louis Dayton think brain. 2nd wave hit, Vietnam thier 14 consecutive days without new community cases. Total deaths went 0 26. Tell stop testing stop deaths?

Edit: said 19 days, fact check actually 14 days comment this. thinking there's way bad Spanish flu. scary parent days. Unless kid 30s, guess. Including brown people south. Karma sucks, huh? Enjoy stalkers ;)  Or... need test much many cases. Look positivity rates, test numbers. Official - public isn‚Äôt allowed know what‚Äôs going on-all numbers must go trump approval. trump doesn‚Äôt approve numbers fake. Trump love. Trump light. 

Believe shit administration campaigning took data won‚Äôt let anyone else confirm it? got fucking bridge Arizona could kid. take next time flu, going go business mere link infection chain kills someone, well... guess that's brakes, huh?

This literally opposite saying. hard tell trolling genuinely unable understand position. pointed flu kills people still go flu spread around think nothing it. 

And pointing something categorically wrong faulty argument. People intentionally spread flu, people ""think nothing"" flu. 

As already stated ignored, vaccines flu. vaccine means people less likely infected likely fight are. People understand deadly flu is, know stay isolated rest sick. Fly symptoms start show within 1 - 4 days, meaning infected likelihood spreading others significantly lower told false equivalence

Because is. means guess risk worth it?)

Again, literally opposite said. know better, I'd say selfish.

Explaining wrong thought one death many?

It is. Intentionally exposing others know infected flu indescribably stupid horrible. 

Leaving home flu Coronavirus leaving home sick cold, stomach bug, liver cancer, UTI, sore throat, HIV, Zika virus. said ""sick all"" please lie pretend mean sick anything. 

*Knowingly* exposing others flu unacceptable. *Knowingly* exposing others Coronavirus unacceptable. say, *knowingly* exposing others easily communicable, highly deadly illness unacceptable. mean Canadian takes place? (Fam 4) ok agree blame equally people ones spreading it. really thing coronavirus. COVID attacks respiratory system, nervous system. believe referring [opportunistic something generally specific AIDS. doubt catching COVID puts greater risk infections, mostly way around. 

For example, [those high blood pressure, obesity diabetes 300% higher death rate definitely [see reflected comorbidity Sad part supporting human welfare many supporting human welfare humans cant that.

Absolutely horrifying level new cases there. Deaths skyrocket couple weeks. died *with* lack oxygen *from* lack oxygen? Yah, didn't. Guess again. Killing em winning? Fergusson plenty credibility problems, say least.

However, ""doing nothing"" interesting concept. might say one ever ""does nothing"". make model profoundly useless.

Diseases robustly airborned like measels anthrax could never spread widely. Behavior would change. 

These models also assume point collapsed medical care, unlikely happen except extremely under-resourced medical systems profoundly poorly educated populations. 

But still make argument Swedish population changed behavior halted spread infections there. honest idea would want award post like this, matter sit political spectrum. I‚Äôm calling it, America hit 325,000 covid deaths March 1st next year. Plus it‚Äôll officially year since normal life looks DEPRESSING. Remember trump said would gone easter? scarecrow-with-candy bowl much solution. thought particular Halloween memory long time. US relevant call Virus Covid responsible racism? talking about? Even without covid pumps gas comes home doesnt wash hands? Must kind security protects election process. Reading article says they're paid. Sources differ they're paid well. Dunno reading can't say deployment. Really? Everyone knows lying 2045 Same. active case weeks. glad isolation once. others said, problem doctors hospitals. problem political institutions documented intentionally fudging data get kids back school. told boss hearing 250,000 deaths within year projected (this March, shutdown). well way that. beating US like 50 years ago. flu x3. Nothing worry 

/s article correct reflect rehab center worker attend wedding, housemate did. adds another layer. fair huge vector originally allowed dock, thus turning small outbreak ship wide one. Oops! heard spread France Chinese woman violated quarantine, wanting eat escargot. would expected that?  /s Good points. I've come realise people take Facebook gospel almost. remember arguing one friend kept bringing people Facebook thought prove im wrong seatbelts!

No smoke detectors!

The second US cut funding ensured self-fulfilling prophecy regards WHO. boys Wisconsin everything guys added benefit personal freedoms. Lots issues testing. negativr test mean it. Hopefully better Vancouver, huskey play corgi puppy! People also don‚Äôt realize ‚Äúcasualties‚Äù war include injuries sort well. So, COVID-19 honestly kicking shit literal World Wars.    Europe poorly also amount lot places. global pandemic. Literally, next fucking day ""finally"" decided take things seriously. Point excess deaths running 200,000 expected deaths, COVID killing people unknown disease killing people. it

God damnit country fucking stupid. We're literally looking details leaving everything we've built immigrating. Testing progress although capacity still ramped up. think far 2,000 risk people tested, negative far.

Usually city goes movement restriction everything shutdown allowed leave home reason unless pass. pass get issued things like week groceries.

That said deliveries considered essential services China pretty much buy everything online get delivered despite lockdown. article actually says staff member sick person live attended. staff member attend wedding, housemate. win? well.that it. going run office get vocal this.

this never become this.

the gov care noting money. it. think would. People careful, take seriously, exposed, likely infected much higher rate general population. people likely also responsible spreading. But, infected, probably also immune (to extent), slow spread future.

Add somewhat better treatment options now, somewhat better widespread testing, seems reasonable assume spread slow. 600k 2020? 400k three months? ain‚Äôt even lunch yet. people say US greatest country earth. proof are. much winning  left saying numbers intentionally depressed, pointing limits well doctors count using actual research study evidence. ""both sides"" bullshit tired. problem. us willing fix. Herd immunity also isn‚Äôt zero sum game. people become infected immunized, Rt decreases rate spread decrease. 

For Covid-19 R0 approximately 2-2.5, translates 50-60% required ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù. Taking NYC antibody study face value, 22% antibody positive May. seroprevalence would bring reproductive value ~1.5. However, lieu lockdown likely herd immunity would overshot, higher percentage population theoretically required achieve herd immunity could become infected.

With NYC seeing Rt near 1.0 measures (masks, distancing, lockdowns, awareness, hand hygiene, etc.) attribute another significant decrease spread virus.  Sure, I'm doomsdayer. think things eventually get better. 

If look numbers today, write down. we're better position 5 years... I'll blown away. 

Maybe right (I hope anyway)  call European virus Chinese virus How's smoke there? I'm choked death COVID-laced smoke made Murika Vancouver area. That‚Äôs good. thought germ bowl less optimal. quote article posted....lol. like post It?

So no. Even day able accomplish shutdown. way, real important reason advocated shut first place. Perhaps right thinking could never enforced work first place, thus always going stupid try. speaking mother briefly mentioned understand upset. Sounds like idea ""quarantining"" ""socially distancing"" meant different Well except deaths started rise around month cases started rising US fits whole lag lag cases deaths.

Deaths began rise around early July 5th/6th July US around 3-4 week lag cases deaths. deaths accelerated quite alot going 519 5th July 737 11th July reaching 1,000 mark 7 day moving average. 

If look Spain whole different story. Cases started rise around mid june end June. rise quite sharply. We're mid September around 2-2.5 months cases rising month would expected deaths accelerate. Yet deaths risen 2 deaths back July around 59 deaths day yesterday. yes rise deaths nothing significant like saw US back March/April.

Sure. think  apologies. take back. know vermont well years Sanders love it.  provided spray bottle rubbing alcohol. too, friends wearing masks March got flak conservative friends family, president others downplayed risks briefings every day. Even cautioned people buy masks, Fauci [clear pandemic could get serious. Folks saying 'we lied doctors' fault' paying attention, probably team 'You're crazy wear mask' back spring.

edit: added link March 15 transcript. Recall, point, folks said Dr. Fauci overreacting serious. never locked first time, working normal year. months ago redditor saying TX contact tracing program definitely going work others laughed assertion got huffy puffy lol Fauci: ""There's reason walking around mask"". 

[Youtube interview messed up, *hard*. need admit that. Republicans Facebook feed constantly use say trust anything said now. That's important lie public, even short-term benefit might provide. lied masks, lied masks would help, politicians lied polarize issue (saying one set protests unsafe would cause spike cases, saying another magically perfectly safe fine)

Lets forget ""fact checkers"" marking TRUTHS said topic ""fake news"" official narrative masks help.

I know reddit cool hate people believe anything anymore, authorities WONDERS undermine authority expertise. Problem many people slow spread.  Really pissed *fucking months* argue morons internet bought line somehow masks magical one way filter material somehow help breathing in, somehow could help breathing mask *pushed fucking face*. fucking morons god damn hostile certainty. fucking idiots use basic god damn common sense, cost lives.  ...that wasnt meant insult. commenting different office holders Vermont are. sure throwing shade? really rude uncalled for.

Once learned that, masks became necessary slow spread people unknowingly virus. It‚Äôs top Maybe you‚Äôre right, Biden sure said it.

That‚Äôs even close confirmed started Kansas thought discouraged masks use didn‚Äôt realize extent asymptomatic spread? individual consumers even potential disrupt hospital supply lines, huge problem. can't believe claim protect hospital supplies, can't possibly buying pool masks hardware stores. 


Not mention, even pool, governments could taken emergency action ensure masks ended hospitals, rather people's basement. Using CFR instead IFR project death totals wrong, misleading, dangerous. sent via 7 million Americans dead....STFU. tired misinformation coming sides.

So know actual estimate deaths happen continue living life there's pandemic? know. Thanks. Every thread entire subreddit lame 5 6 comments recycled Depends state lived great question. found article: ""But mean would good take aspirin daily preventative measure case contract COVID-19?

"" ‚ÄúIt would absolutely good idea people start taking aspirin based research,‚Äù Nissen said. ‚ÄúI strongly discourage it.‚Äù""  source really mean anything ""maybe 4600 cases New York COVID, we're pretty sure is""

You can't apply rest states well, play assumption game I'll indulge you.

So let's say 0% ""probably COVID cases"" actually COVID apply rest deaths US.

The death toll actually 80% listed number then. That's still least 160k deaths.

That still puts USA one worst Western countries world. mention cases reported cause death ""pneumonia"" like. stats yet since 2020 over, bet there's gonna huge spike respiratory related deaths.

It's also hard say 200k number coming 100% COVID positive cases - they're including ""most likely COVID"" cases well.

Besides, gain doctors reporting deaths? Wow, insight nobody help film uncommercial experimental film. hated it.  Trump, obviously? He's done many things directly worsened spread. simply anything would ""saved"" people. 

Obviously things different. used gauge limit using pitchforks speak. Seems like Nazi holocaust enough ignore law. Good one. really really hate people say much love Fauci. Trump biggest hypocrite America Fauci May #2  really good news me. I‚Äôm thinking Q3 100% normal, restrictions begin slowly surely lift around March-April. Victoria giving ""best"" go whole western world, like 6+ weeks virus gone. started place lower propagation US right now. Yup. outbreak unit went get tested, told can‚Äôt drive thru became adamant work covid patients super high risk dealing airways. 
We shortage masks April 2 day supply luckily got whole bunch reusable masks properly fit tested everyone. run Republican progressive lieutenant. they're really throwing darts huh also lie people don‚Äôt trust stuff. effect mask doesn‚Äôt become 0, becomes less effective. Stop hyperbole, entire thread lies like got us mess. 

N95 cloth cloth remove sometimes mask Trump anti mask even Fauci whoever else want shift blame changed guidelines. Ahh okay. Yes. page agree. Literally Reports indicated Fauci [pressured risks along. also recall folks advocating masks March, people telling crazy radical.

In meantime continue advocate authoritarianism, history shows always vindicated end. Yup. 1st year I'm ok snow tho. actually love snow, hate driving it. Working home actually nice. quarantined. Trump‚Äôs failed half-assed attempt show face absolutely nothing spread virus.

And rest retorts nothing debunked conspiracy theories outright lies led United States 20% deaths 5% population.

I can‚Äôt wait science deniers genocidal maniacs lose power again. mention families lost multiple members, grief must unbearable. yet could crank new fighter bomber every 20 minutes WWII üôÑ disagreement dude/dudette

I'm really unsure genie put back bottle; seems larger passionate push anti-mask crowd/people believe Covid hoax

My fear world done Covid sooner us we're going drag things domestically. read source? 

It literally says right abstract ""it's unclear true infection occurs"" girl üòÇüòÇ

And pandemic ever ended vaccine actually. think Spanish flu plague would like word u.

Also worried eradication point. ending pandemic. sort co-morbidities, ex: obesity, hypertension, history PEs, I‚Äôd call doctor ASAP. white house take action improve covid response. spreading fake analogy always bad one though. 

For one, traffic accidents contagious. get accident next people meet also get accident. 

Also, take precautions always updating rules infrastructure prevent traffic accidents. Localities always modifying intersection lights, signage etc avoid these. 

It's definitely lock entirely nothing COVID either, number deaths, nature cause determines mitigate it. No, lied multiple times private said stupid shit throughout spring happened March now, even would effective, late. People 0 confidence corona response, going get people buy even stricter lockdown 6 months later. Florida mostly open except Bars/Clubs several months peaked July 15. 

CLI hospitalizations lowest levels since march.

The data speaks itself. fearmongering *must* end. since asked hit beer. Reddit: ‚ÄúBelieve science‚Äù

Also Reddit: ‚Äúanyone half brain would known CDC/WHO lying. I‚Äôve always pro mask!!‚Äù Death never primary problem contracting COVID young age... want save economy, get virus control

It's obvious strange even issue.

I mean. ""Will people go cinema less, includes risk getting really disease"". Well d'oh lol.

The fear virus kills consumption, people want consume get sick process. longer time virus around, businesses involves contact people (cinema, restaurants such) go bust.

Movie theatres might never recover tbh. Streaming threat already. 

I'd check sales nice home movie cinema gear gone - I'd expect that. possible build mini-theatre home today.

And I'd expect people got gear that, they'll keep using come back theatres much, permanently. political discussion relation covid perfectly acceptable.

Ive travelled around Cuba twice. Heard plenty radio stations pocking fun governent speeches, amateur vloggers facebook samd, plenty intellectuals newspaper collumns talking policies shouldnt passed, local elections random people fix agendas little paper blocks outside city halls, people like say never happens like didnt see first hand.

Its golden Switzerland, pretend North Korea even close? blame living conditions dont fight massive inflated costs investment due embargo. tastes like pure Kool Aid. Yep! Quite impressive country crushed economic embargo. I‚Äôd even say democracy far transparent United States, isn‚Äôt saying much, yeah. Fuck. That's sarcasm, man. Sarcasm based frustration, usually people actually take pandemic seriously. 

You comparing leader USA downplaying pandemic basically politicizing creating *massive* group people buck measures control virus. anti-mask rallies fucks sake. Thats *a little* different someone sarcastically pointing worst entire world dealing this. I'm holding Pillow guy, get medical information him! literally every respiratory illness, yes makes sense worry fever cough .....oh god.... k ow lot people found healing cptsd going ACoA. *at current Rt*

Start allowing concerts, minor league baseball, soccer, etc full capacity get another burn-through higher Rt.

Remember, immunity / burning dependent upon spread rate, higher Rt burns another segment.

Many = few. Even AZ put mask orders shut things peak spread, still many mitigations place. like CTVNews website breaks health units reporting cases, least Ontario. Every day whip calculator minus total say ""thank fuck live smaller city"". Take GTA Ottawa around 30-40 cases province wide. get people still claim like flu. We've 2-3 many people die worst flu season ever, that's lockdowns masks social distancing shit. show New York Times article excess deaths around world: US, 19%. punching part. come continue get colds lives get much easier (in experience)? ‚ÄúScience doesn‚Äôt know‚Äù Houston Rockets lockdown possible antibodies bind disease part body surface spike protein also matches normal human cells. likely? no. that's testing.

With SARS original vaccine induced antibody production made disease worse. 5 governors send infected elderly back nursing homes killing tens thousands U.S. numbers would bad. close flights China (which even fully do).  git gud unmentioned long term damage finances, physical ailments improve.

Even insurance, American hospital charges tens thousand dollars. take months years people pay off. month hospital treatment make poor. Yes, science fictions. best argument higher standards say others lower standards /s remember projection said reach 200k december. say worst numbers could 3 - 4 million? several factors affect case numbers - largely dependent number tests conducted. many positive tests asymptomatic. It‚Äôs good indicator spread disease. 

Also, July time many areas began opening - holiday. It‚Äôs difficult separate causes case count rise. holiday alone, rise would seen across state lines. zero. There's antibodies make diseases worse either causing runaway immune response helping enter cells.

There's also antibodies cause autoimmune reactions. body actively selects immune cells produce antibodies (also potentially evolutionary reason stop producing naive cells age mutations slowly build bacteria/viruses insert healthy cell dna lay dormant, selecting ""our cells"" becomes harmful later on) want punch something still hear people saying ""the flu worse"". mask protesters white. think get sick.

As consumer, oh boy, can't wait see that's like... 

I blame restaurant industry constantly cutting costs ""streamlining"" processes. tough industry make profitable. Jesus Christ every year like quality restaurant food keeps getting worse worse, particularly chains. Since live big city anymore restaurants worth dining food, convenience.

Since pandemic freed time I've getting better cooking skills. I'm still disappointed almost every single restaurant chain know decreased food quality time.

Now, 240,000 seem outlandish all. death toll already projected 220,000-225,000 election day. 240,000 exceeded New Year even absence another wave (and assuming drastic slowdown deaths months come).  That's probably NYC's first wave ""finished"". country still getting ravaged first wave. death toll still counting stopping anytime soon. 2044 right!? Right!?!? I'll leave here.

This probably biggest concern lockdowns/this pandemic response, American big-picture policy thinking past twenty years-- ONE THINKS END GAME. victory look like? metrics we're aiming stop using masks end lockdown restrictions? one defines things. buying time, thinking they'll figure end game they're middle response. 

It's like Iraq. idea ""victory"" looked like took Saddam Hussein. throwing money hole thinking things would magically resolve eventually. see lot covid response. Wipes hard get here, cherry coke zero impossible, lysol disinfectant spray exists myth. know single time attempted challenged massive infectious disease outbreak? established. govt requirement protect pubic welfare. towns closed border great flu. servants work, therefore exempt? fluke? kidding me? Prime Minister gave daily goddamn press announcements front porch. isolating Wifes contact? grew hair long beard showed he's dealing like rest us. 

You saw exactly happened Toilet paper. exact thing would happened masks. It‚Äôs polarising America, story doesn‚Äôt check out. stop paying politicians  mean they're suggesting government weld door shut takes, honestly point I'd okay that. I'm antisocial enough think want us social distance lockdown another year want come say mass freakouts. I'm already cannot see light end tunnel, imagine others lose hope well. exactly. both.

Like, group 10 unsafe, 8 isn't? Walmart safe shop at, longest time small mom pop places closed? listening science, fuckery afoot, dash dash there. 

I heard someone say **Science messy living it.**  Well yeah, people wear masks time. wear one exercise outside either.

Until results boom new hospitalizations, I'm exceptionally worried it. I've going friends precautions. I've hanging small groups homes. church still meeting person. okay live life little bit right now. That‚Äôs approximately effective flu vaccine 

And like flu vaccine, still catch illness usually less severe illness virtue vaccinated ‚ÄúIdiots aisle 5, they‚Äôre headed chips next.‚Äù

But seriously, even think it‚Äôs hoax, remotely care I‚Äôm wearing mask Target places? It‚Äôs like keeping grandma kid scanning stuff free germs would ever bad thing. experiment conducted first time actually must stand test repeatability consensus.

This patently Otherwise people making claims daily kinds bogus

This happens every single day, even scientific journals. hope absolutely ridiculous ones would rejected publication that's always true. submissions scientific rigor still perfectly good candidates publication even seem implausible. Follow papers challenge support evidence, find fault refine theory.

This without going entire additional egregious issue statement gets say ""bogus"".

I assume scientific background? countries, people want wear mask tasked digging graves die covid-19. idea delays bad not. I've seen statistics Sweden. anyone link another country fast reporting?

I mean countries always reporting day next, bad numbers. However contries similar worse delays, normal. Germany yesterday: 1,623 new cases

Denmark: 334

Norway: 117

Finland: 98

Murica:  Honestly. see people walking onto streetcar grocery store immediately removing masks... going make mandatory, fucking consequences I'd think. saw guy yesterday smirk like thought cute gaming system... Ugh. can‚Äôt find glimmer hope news don‚Äôt know tell could found legal pretext limit travel states.

it's patently established unconstitutional Vaccine. There's 40 worth talking various stages throughout world. There's something like 200 different efforts overall. phase 3 testing pretty quick ongoing epidemic since two doses side effects either show month two don't. Lol what? Fauci approached caution nuance, Trump straight demonizing masks, within administration publicly That's part problem, though. able trust medical authorities tell us worldwide pandemic. wade scientific medical studies find truth. grandparents, even internet, certainly ability. trust whomever news paper. punishments authorities lied pandemic. Yup. Hospitals still PPE shortages, 6 months this. moment someone says ""believe science"" alarm bells go off, lol. Science require belief, evidence. prefer rubbing alcohol enema flashlight plug 45 minutes.  Calling someone coward sitting behind keyboard. love it. I'd bet would toss word around face face. sayin. I‚Äôve heard past 6 months... hasn‚Äôt collapsed fact recovering think currently seven vaccines tested. late students withdrawal get refund? Whenever date Yeah. second this. It‚Äôs mandatory state - counties ‚Äúopted out‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs mandatory students staff school (I‚Äôm teacher) - I‚Äôm staff member mask meetings. 

It‚Äôs maddening.  scare mongering role administration, spent years saying sky fall/is falling. happened government afraid people would eat supply masks therefore leave health services lacking.

I don‚Äôt think whole story. Western experts initially evaluated masks one-dimensionally...how impacted wearer, excluding impact wearing mask impacts others.

Combined underestimation asymptotic transmission, think many think non N95 masks little use.

The ‚Äúpreservation supply‚Äù story fig leaf cover poor analysis/reasoning Cool. read stories like March/April. Still wait week get results.

Hopefully get soon time. wish god damned people power would recommend cloth masks everyone much much sooner.

The CDC recommended 3rd April. mid February would great, real problem initial recommendation continued division Trump administration. 

Additionally, think really say Fauci ""retelling lie."" could instrumental decision say people wear masks. happen link two handy? great point I'd like read it. nuance many comments miss. People Melbourne basically prisoners now. missing 5K! That's little dodgy.

And yes, go back historically -- rough measure, seem worth it. vaccine proven work distribution, really isn‚Äôt glimmer here. speculation hope Tunevall study (the one hints actual harm done masks) seems looking post-operative site infections staphylococcus, skin bacteria likely spread touch contamination skin shedding rather exhaled. Tunevall argues loose mask could potentially rubbing skin chafing extra skin cells could contaminate open wound. study says nothing effectiveness viral spread suggest masks *are* helpful protecting ""sore throats"".

The Lipp review 2016 update clarify looking improperly worn masks , also focused wound infections (via staph bacteria etc.) rather viral spread.

The Webster study is, again, focused bacterial wound infection focuses non-scrubbed staff members (scrubbed staff still wore masks) interesting results settle plates additional growth, that's anomalous result many studies shown increased growth settle plates (for example, first random hit google scholar: methods studies using examined see got different results.

These studies make argument mask wearing investigated potentially optional comfort surgical staff, none seem demonstrate harm wearing mask Tunevall, one focused viral spread. overestimated windows think lied prevent hoarding we'd able ensure healthcare workers would them. I'm overly fond lied good hurts credibility we're kind dumb maybe necessary. well good news finished ghosts tushiuma, last us 2, maxed 5 seasonal characters diablo 3 getting paid tax payers hasnt bad.

Perfect. Cook books reopen, fix it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot fault‚Äù data failed you?  exactly said. actual quote facemask guaranteed offer everyone protection, vaccine could offer none people immune response generated.

Not wrong, necessarily, weird way say good news, apparently movie theaters opened FL too! dumbest thing I've ever heard. Remember bots trolls thing. Definitely possible misinformation warfare going there. negative obviously meant masks give protection all. worst give false sense security encourages people follow other, effective measures social distancing currently. number go number 16X lower accurate. getting number from?  don‚Äôt live older parents people taking risks going ‚Äúback normal‚Äù also seeing ‚Äúat risk‚Äù elderly parents time?

It would really exciting potus same, hopefully, next year. Agreed. Yeah know use mice. guy specifically asked testing humans, will. That's told opinion testing see drug affects young mice

Which brilliant, developing medicine mice. Ultimately, decided‚Äîhopefully using advanced knowledge available‚Äîthat less people would die healthcare workers higher access PPE general public.

Except actually happened easily predictable: hoarders resellers bought available masks anyway. traded goodwill people for....nothing? 

Had instead said ""we know masks work, please buy cloth masks save N95s medical professionals"", hoarders resellers would *still* bought could, least would kept American's trust lying faces.  100% agree first point. Tam Trudeau dropped ball hard here.

To second point re: testing, need go back frame comments time period. point time Canada ramped testing capabilities test reserved need most. 

The advice time contact infected individual, even showing symptoms, required isolate 14 days. came contact confirmed infected didn‚Äôt need take test didn‚Äôt change required actions all: positive needed self isolate 14 days, negative *still* needed self isolate 14 days.

But still what's likely smartest thing, cautious thing, results in. 

The mask people fucking stupid, entire plan pandemic absolutely nothing, spread dangerous disease everyone quickly possible. 

And sure, might fair plan get herd immunity. 

But that's plan, mask people line up, intentionally given covid, herded together month cruise something, get immunity transferred back population, helping them. die that's choice, fair, instead determining everyone else's lives recklessness.

Still gagillion times less awful shingles though. virus spread mostly particles small, masks going effective permeable particles size. Masks effective things would require larger droplets propagate, could trap droplets. extent virus mostly droplet spread even crappy masks might help.

So there‚Äôs contradiction saying virus airborne also (non-respirator) masks effective. thought r/newsofthestupid. Well, event probably make sub eventually. mean time, insult here? goes...

Also, primary purpose mask protect *other people* contracting potentially asymptomatic covid. pure selfishness wear mask. wore masks would collectively less covid. idiots understand that. what? hostile country specifically bombing retirement homes old peoples houses total amount dead 200k, would people think ""This fine, old people dying."" could US chose let virus spread USA order kill people pre-existing medical conditions expensive treat.

You're selfish different reason. 

Some people prepared sacrifice people's physical health come lockdown earlier spare people's mental health.

You're prepared sacrifice people's mental health stay lockdown longer spare people's physical health.

There ""right"" answer. I'll probably remain using crowded places (buses, airplanes, etc) years come, always thought using never came around actually buying one, several necessity, they'll stay. also baffled years use one flu cold. 

That said, yes, social distancing masks everywhere ignored remains general recommendation expect absolutely one follow vaccine. BILL GATES LIKE U UNDERSTAND PLEASE CONTINUE ADVISE US MEDICAL ISSUES... please tell us like deposition video- u way words I'm putting money Pfizer. Nightclubs bars aren‚Äôt open US government pre purchased doses, meaning government foot bill doses, public. doses priced $20 each, mean we're paying directly. bill get either reimbursement government paid, saying do, physical services getting it. know probably referring disposable P100, people often get confused reusable work-related P100 masks, protect people around you, fact might make worse. think strategy was?

Back March, strategy ""two weeks flatten curve"" prevent hospitals overrun. Well, ***six months*** in, hospitals **still** overrun well past peak virus turned significantly less deadly infectious thought people still pushing newer stricter lockdowns? work. government imposed punishment requires live court process (if demanded), exposes court staff virus also requires proof infraction (a photo taken law enforcement), rarely gonna available. going make parties even intriguing they're banned. risk $100 that? might help bit public places like stores, they're presumably already allowing people unless masked. Cosnervatives shown are. Trump lied, sent kids school anyway thinking fine. they're still defending decision. people live planet us. They're garbage needs trash planet rot on. source? would interested Germany‚Äôs numbers regarding undercounting / excess deaths. want literal, none numbers mean XXX people died Covid past 24 hours actual number can‚Äôt known. 

In places takes 3+ weeks tally deaths, retroactively correct numbers time; they‚Äôre overwhelmed, may take quite time reasonably accurate data available. take $1 donate rest need?

Lolnope. I'm mobile. Sorry, dialect use ud. much. can't even reply Spanish? Must polyglot wiz claim be. Also, English full sentence fragments... might want fix asap. Averaging year weak flu season pointless, unless trying manipulate data favour. lot things could kill someone love. worry things well? live garden style apartment. porches porch lights turn off. sun sets 6pm Halloween night.

I skeptical Sweden's approach first looking American-centric viewpoint, daily life people 0 social distancing, respect personal space, listen govt. practice good hygiene. can't ""influenced"" made confirm simple appeals social norms / mores.

Mitigation viral epidemics cumulative effect many different factors. Masks probably help little bit. Distance probably helps lot. Hygiene helps. 

Each represents another % two lower infection rate put together, small base numbers equal small final counts, especially exponential systems. Bro six months this. bad call people need wake fuck start wearing mask. ""I see value wasting time fake,"" says think relationships people requires fake. far ""pretending enjoy latest franchised garbage"" goes, plenty movies franchises. ü•∞ sorry nobody life loves cares enough want things you, sounds like really missing out. ""Experts"" IHME panicked forecasters predicting millions deaths US. we're heading towards 250k deaths end year despite extremely lax rules something subreddit would laugh March April. dad sent email says masks don‚Äôt work... /s extrapolate based properties similar viruses evidence for.

It nothing virus everything data efficacy masks protect others. read comment literally two studies done inconclusive usefulness. Yes Oh penn state students living parents now? remember beginning, course immediately knowing lot virus, public health professionals said masks ineffective own. discussed extensively participants roundtable meetings. statement still mostly true mask effective wearer also engages safety precautions washing hands social distancing. Wearing mask absolutely grant immunity wearer continues day constant contact others.

Edit: exact thing happen vaccine. vaccine prove 70% effective scientists say trust vaccine completely protect you. public interpret vaccine effective. vaccine widely available, scientists encourage people get vaccination line defense. People interpret scientists changing story. Wanna try Obama also got attacked one started immigration policies put kids cages. Potayto Potahto comment literally said 'wear masks that's implying wearing masks measure needed. Nah dude I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre wrong Newly gay dog lovers move fast!

At core, attempt get virus control terms number infections meantime ensure infrastructure place reopening took place, test trace capable stopping spread tracks.

In end, work well cases well-funded health care system, e.g. Germany.  thing is, teachers buy supplies, shows administration government schools need funding. Teachers buy pocket.

If Teachers stopped this, would realize problem fix it. profession requires employees buy work supplies?? Care elaborate? safe resume life normal experts say become seasonal virus Paywall Bill Gates use billions buy us masks Kid, world lot complicated that. You‚Äôll figure day hope use familiar tu refer please. know like that. using formal speaking me. single accent either. means wrong. still go work least week physically. Sorry, going stop liking snow finding upside. live north still reason barely saw snow last year. None lockdown itself. solid public health team well. taken much toll mental health. Even opted semester college online I‚Äôve trying protect others like I‚Äôve done past six months.

January March I‚Äôll start going instead house 24/7 like I‚Äôve doing. March 2021, I‚Äôm completely it. pandemic ruined life year, won‚Äôt get another one me. Challenging consensus mean exempt verifiability. Verifiability comes precision. Precision asserted repeated independent research conducted topic. Completely new discoveries experiments based existing material thing. defensive attitude displaying constant loop importantly, why? people mentality helping virus survive longer needs to.

The virus going around regardless. giving year life disease probably affect me. welcome continue hiding house. - we're ""free"" live life without burdened laws enforced.

The entire freaking country Wild West, smartphones. solution high-risk individuals able self-isolate indeterminate amount time force... everyone... self-isolate indeterminate amount time? realize absurd solution is? curiosity power Netherlands? right wing party? wait things inverted compared USA right left?

So like..more like socials accepting immigrants, towards nationalist/populist/sovereign tending racist party? least, let‚Äôs stop running masks longer don‚Äôt wear them, longer wear them. mention whole new layer administration money‚Äôs tight. didn‚Äôt right, they‚Äôd counterfeited useless. forget contrarian people wrote articles saying ""well might give people false sense security, masks dangerous push"". 100% part problem too.  Meeting family leading spread covid-19. family meets every Sunday solely decided see anyone else. we‚Äôre contained much be. Restaurants bars another place high transmission rates.

Seriously wtf us Americans selfishness. done rest world we‚Äôd much better off. 

Think wait see winter goes decide things ‚Äúregardless‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs people mentality helping virus survive longer needs to.

As people saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm risk‚Äù realize covid leave body damage you‚Äôve recovered? Cardiovascular respiratory damage? worth extra 6 months live damage rest life? I've probably 5 6 times since March, honest. go anywhere, except hang grandmother parents outside every week so, 10 feet apart, lawn chairs.

I really want visit grandmother weekend, go places... fun, lots stores. it'll cold hang outside (for her, least). wants us sit inside, 6 feet apart, masks on. I'm freaked idea can't see May...

Is really dangerous around someone inside masked? make safer?

Edit: infection rate 1.6% new cases county today yesterday. also matter of, think, logic. keep mind, highest level education graduating high school.

One first things heard disease affected lungs transmitted air. Now, high school diploma mind meant use masks would help contain spread. Why? mask stops spittle flies mouths speak. basic. still dont understand reluctance people wearing dehumanize people non-pandemic times

They really don't, make choices.   live nearly many dead. think estimation much room error actually was. Many medical professionals similar concern-the public trained mask handling tends touch masks wear improperly masking may make careless. Wait, quality country America shithole?

I'm ashamed Canadian feel somehow relevant America shithole, feel free criticize Canada. really bother me, I'm ignorant patriot.

I keep thinking ""Americans can't get much dumber"" prove wrong every time! Oregon we're wayyy ahead you, Michael. least next four days breathe outside again. Well I'm trying interpret sounds like baseless paranoia. deliver causal link statements I'm convinced merit consideration presented is. Ah both! even people like asthma could get more. tell [83 million currently many children well could die, direct result covid lockdowns. hey, economy important we've got virus .5% fatality rate stop, right?! can't downvote move sometimes. Well, often. gets me. learn let it. Anyone coming post, please read article. title misleading that‚Äôs said don‚Äôt freak out. I‚Äôd go step further. Masks yes. *self-protective* masks. time ‚Äúwear mask others‚Äù coming close. 

When vaccine announced distributed, even it‚Äôs healthcare workers first, protection self-protective masks. 

I‚Äôm Florida. Trust me.. people parts country seen I‚Äôve seen last six months, you‚Äôd wear scuba tank ‚Äòtil 2022. üòÇ Vaccinate vulnerable, cut deaths down, im going back normal hear i'm saying. 

 Even terminal, killed faster *(and basically drowning fluids, horrible)* still count dying covid. Someone grabbed Raid aisle 17. Pneumonia caused viruses bacteria infecting lung, cold. you‚Äôre going arguing measures Covid-19, really brush basic medical knowledge beforehand. 

There loads viruses bacteria carry around later infect someone else kill them. happends time. Pneumonia, meningitis, mononucleosis etc. Granted, current infectious diseases developed world currently carry great risk someone‚Äôs life Covid-19, risk always there. Where? don‚Äôt know said wasn‚Äôt clear seems obvious. seen numbers quite way, seems plausible. 968K dead deaths nuclear bombs dropped Atlanta Miami, would go business let happen? response even Miami half leveled 'dud' bomb, foreign entity still planning finish job level Atlanta -- would shrug off? that's point we're now. ""It is"" people. I'd say response still adequate. Seems like superfluous step there's vaccination centers hospitals already. stocks  Probably not.  Please explain ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù spreading. ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÖÿØŸÑŸÑŸá Sorry Bill BS. take rocket scientist know masks used 1918 Spanish Flu plagues prior that. watched youtube video walk streets Wuhan February everybody wearing mask. promptly ordered 40 N95 masks Amazon prices went CDC Fauci saying masks medical personnel back then. could said make masks buy nonmedical masks.  Would saved countless lives. Meeting family, going restaurants/bars, seeing films theaters, etc. Guess way since he‚Äôs starting talk sense.

Practically obvious statement. basically saying know exact origin virus, China hiding it.

Well, ... that's ""basically"" said all. yes, even surgeon general taught people make shirts elastic bands back March circled internet. can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm conversation point known.  Yeah, CDC massively fucked one. lied try preserve N-95 masks medical workers.

But doesn‚Äôt mean refusing wear mask basically like drunk driving. It‚Äôs stupid, reckless, likely kill people. source obviously Nordic countries official statistics. available public see stats given day keep growing weeks. Except Sweden.  


It remarkable Swedish authorities done effort better coordinate gathering data regions. risk, know conditions  Define ‚Äúgoing back normal‚Äù literally got called big pharma investor pointing larger company resources experience trial quicker...... üôÑ

How dare point out...... fyi, death throes good person. want wear mask. people wear masks say care lives people. People care lives others good people. good person, want wear mask...

Got it. Masks useless, people wear good people care others; they're dumb people fooled. like me, I'm good person smart. nagging feeling might bad person; really like feeling way.

It's simple that. People thought crazy said 350k end year March. Granted 2 points wrong - thought virus deadly thought nation would take seriously watching happened NY. refreshing see actual sane people commenting sub days. Yeah! Nerds world unite! It‚Äôs sniffed enough tho. ‚ÄúThey‚Äù contradict time mixed another poster going respond earlier (but end responding to), apologies that.

I'd say that's pretty deadly things considered.

And conservative government, economy minded, worried sick point teachers nurses, needed obviously, told stay away work get tested cases near infected people.

When say ""we thought"", think ""feared possible"" would appropriate given little known virus scientific advisers erring side caution.

And course, always possibility reason hospitals overrun due measures taken. certainly worried hospitals around May time authoritative claims struggling cope verge swamped. funny tho beginning expected masks even people saying buy masks hospitals needed them. Ofcourse wasn‚Äôt clear cut funny No, easy make cover exhaust vent. hospitals, put surgical mask exhaust vent. mine, sew special covers cloth use making cloth face masks fit snuggly exhaust. way I'm breathing anything in, I'm still covering droplets exhale.

Maintenance easy, disinfect respirator. want remove filters put paper bag later reuse, cartridges wipe plastic bits disinfectant, need careful touch filter inside get wet.

The drawback they're expensive, personally p100 protection worth it. Half face respirators cheaper, still want eye protection go that. Full face respirators pricey, properly fitted one protect well. also much tourism.

There's actually quite bit tourism. Fortunately lot outdoors though, generally safer activities. seen state license plates popular hiking/swimming spots?

But imagine COVID definitely going hurt ski season year. I'm going back normal January 2021 regardless. outrage now?

People outraged months. usually get downvoted gaslighters. thread anomaly (or, optimistically, sign dam finally broke). Aren‚Äôt mass producing AstraZeneca pfzer moderna? they're also EXTREMELY densely populated (a much bigger factor anything else) comparison US lot tourism

I'm nurse practitioner currently working part COVID-19 pandemic response team FQHC underserved area.

First family pub claims it!? yeah, that's misinformation.

Really, lies. basically saying know exact origin virus, China hiding it. can't assume China knows either. US administration decided make China blind spot international health community. like hanging friend group get angry tell story, accuse fabricating it. Yes that‚Äôs clear. Thanks honesty. made permanent? perfect, right tournament...  Last month, case counts averaging around 350/day. 747 cases one day indeed spike.  doesnt protect anyone. never health, continue control reset.

Unfortunately, looks like positivity still increasing going data 13th september. 1 word: when? president knew it, fairly certain top healthcare officials knew professionals March-2020 advocated masks.  really going way here.

Sorry hurt feelings.  completely agree mask effective. never said weren‚Äôt. They‚Äôre 100% bullet proof could still get virus whether you‚Äôre wearing one not. could case vaccine. Could reduce severity. Could provide immunity. don‚Äôt know yet. opposes OP‚Äôs claim ‚ÄúVaccines don‚Äôt create barrier prevent infection like mask do.‚Äù  told people wear masks.

Meanwhile, China telling citizens get hands many masks possible, national directive time mask up.

Thus ample inventory Chinese nationals US buy send back homeland.

It backfired. 

This called ""losing trade war China"". lot things could kill us, realize that? There‚Äôs chance dying car accident people. I‚Äôm going lock house it. I‚Äôll wear mask protect others people may larger risk.  Except there‚Äôs federal rule requires Found Qanoner. Really?

Same message**s** (plural) group people, different behaviors. ""chance"" ""luck"" people starting wasting hands, wearing masks, practicing social distancing?

And back ""chance"" ""luck"" still ""chance"" ""luck"" people still today it?

I think question - know - IQ/critical_thinking_skills. saying credentials role?

Yup, good luck keeping people indoors away sort human contact -30C seen daylight weeks. expect us believe ‚Äúnoble‚Äù lie. Pathetic overestimated value successful entrepreneur know jack-shit health. Selfish/narcissistic? 100%, yes. understand OP calling dog mermaid scenario. saying, clearly mermaid. Driving car benefits. infectious disease not. false equivalency. That's ad hominem.  need experience able form accurate statements.  Actually, calling ad hominem closer ad hominem said.  hypocrite are. closely reasoned critique over. üôÑ I'd even go far say huge part anti-mask sentiment U.S. direct result actions WHO, Fauci, surgeon general, people charge. ""aw shucks know masks helped"" narrative work went way say save doctors even recommended doctors use cloth masks PPE available. People panic buying ppe legitimate concern, could emphasized people needed use cloth masks leave N95 surgical masks healthcare workers people jobs higher risks infection.  win! tremendous job we're doing. countries second waves need one! bye bye strongest economy world lol I'm suggesting getting cars road, limiting vehicle sizes, investing transit, walking, cycling, drastically reducing speeds, road diets, etc.

All things already varying success sure... exactly different covid analogy terrible. right, basic human socialization is.

Is life right? right someone infect disease? 

No one suggesting one socialize absolute indefinite time. closed 8 stores. PPP money ran sales hadn‚Äôt recovered. sucks, especially since know hard it‚Äôs gonna staff find jobs right now. Lol ok, wrote rule could never apply inconsistently, could mod.  Get antivax shit  It‚Äôs like driving heart attack fly front windshield. really killed you? bad news short term (for next 3-5 years), hopefully good news long term. What's good news? People becoming politically active see happens federal government completely fails them. We're also going to, hopefully, see resurgence mom pop stores simply big box stores going get blow back this.

Maybe I'm optimistic, long term, may moment take Robber Barons oligopolies, like happened turn 20th century. shall see. Dr. Henry says PPE least effective method control risk coming individual study, coming risk management general hierarchy controls. order effective least effective is:

- Elimination

- Substitution

- Engineering

- Administrative 

- PPE

Not coming contact disease effective/sustainable coming contact using PPE. 


Discouraging mask usage short sighted though. obviously knew masks help prevent spread, worn donned/doffed correctly. could said N95s medical masks short supply needed medical professionals encouraging general population use home made solutions. that‚Äôs sub man.. everyone down, good reason.. everyone tired stressed, take internet point good sir vaccine $4 shot. Kind hard make money level. Pfizer Phase 3 trial, based positive safety data, requested expanding 30,000 44,000 participants, part expansion add 16 17 year olds trial.

Prior stage, generally considered unethical perform trials people 18. disagree benefits announcing realistic timeline. Businesses Individuals plan supply chain, operations personal lives around timelines. Now, fairness businesses wisened month-by-month tactic probably relying border opening month. However, government guidance actually realistic estimate would help make planning much accurate. eleventy-seven articles posted topic, search sub you‚Äôre interested. 

Dr John Campbell YouTube, expert UK interviews often, early proponent lots YT videos topic. MedCram, another reliable resource YT videos, also covered it. 

They convinced me; took supplements prior Covid. take Vit D3 now, along Zinc P supposedly helps D3 way forget üòú

I'm one fantasy land.  Pure borderless egalitarianism left hunter gatherer bands.  apocalypse happens, left without agriculture, call skin couple bucks together sing kumbayah. Nothing underestimated. Leaders simply didn‚Äôt listen Doctors Scientists. government concerned making money stabilizing stock market elite. That‚Äôs it. comes reasonable concerns country run actions took past (for example treatment Ukraine). Get rid Putin opinion country reset, US Trump, China CCP.  think current ""anti-masker"" beliefs anything original statements et al. ideologically resistant form collective action wildly individualistic they'd jump volcano government told to. Someone Facebook group I‚Äôm said ‚ÄúLook, don‚Äôt cases Wuhan. Personally think isolated much didn‚Äôt let group immunity thing‚Äù facepalmed. Like realize Wuhan went onto STRICT lock 3 months? Let‚Äôs hope vaccine first approved one relatively quick easy produce. Multiple vaccines would bonus. too, hope it‚Äôs long need cooperative help neighbors again. states, lesson I‚Äôve learned countrymen demonstrated disinterest working toward common goal, instead exploit situation ... whatever local elite want. state they‚Äôre organizing around limiting gubernatorial executive actions. 

Sure different keep calm carry mindset. way, I‚Äôm glad free always trying meet middle!  ""party line"" people love say discussions. disagree current administration, automatically assume power magical anti-virus fairy would come saved us. would ""much much"" better. way predict that. America like country earth. huge (in terms physical space), incredibly diverse group people, various state-to-state mentalities/rules, several factors. Automatically assuming something tiny country like Japan, even europe would work perfectly wild stretch. truth government prepared (this likely spans many presidential administrations) half people believe level emergency half believes is. Add fact WHO, CDC agencies charged managing types things agree proper approach. result have. likely would way matter leadership. may play larger role community spread COVID-19 previously thought They're confident sufficient people willing take newly rushed vaccine? DNA üß¨ told masks effective start need get protect themselves, 90% people would wearing masks right now. Please provide statement try stop laughing. know anything career? Democrats rolled lots lies &amp; terrible decisions early on. I‚Äôm Democrat &amp; appalled none publicly speaking safe practices early. kept waiting publicly disagree terrible policies went research time didn‚Äôt. 

They nothing could point fingers later &amp; whine charge. don‚Äôt power make national policies voice &amp; chose anything. 

They want us point fingers across aisle essentially everyone office right quiet first (aka basically them) shares blame happened US. Thanks linking. always concern blood thinners. younger people suspect. likely hit head blood thinner like aspirin, could become something worse. 1000 people dying everyday. ‚ÄúNonsensical panic!‚Äù FOH ""We""? I'm suggesting locking save traffic fatalities, I'm suggesting getting cars road, highly strict licensing requirements, limiting vehicle sizes, investing transit, walking, cycling infrastructure, pedestrianizing urban streets, drastically reducing speeds, road diets, moving freight trucks rail etc. Again, *slightest* intrusions upon American autocentric culture met scorn. discconect.

Driving right, basic human socialization is. thought taxpayers fund purchases? Reality taught harsh lesson. now. Cries Andrew Yang respectable news outlet reported that. think made number we're talking ""anyone wants it,"" I'd say that's probably right. 

If we're talking doctors, nurses, school staff, at-risk people... think much sooner, make statement wrong. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Us never achieved Okay, could phrased differently. meant severely reduced point might able actually manage it, never completely eradicated point. hey, nothing matters anyway like said, people shit heads. make people wear masks eating drinking though? Genuine question. one-way systems pubs restaurants UK seem pretty effective actually, since germs shed one direction easy keep distance people walking ahead (although suspect two meters sufficient distance people moving, I'm surprised seen one article safe distance cyclists). masks mandated years years become ‚Äúminor inconvenience.‚Äù say ""preserve masks healthcare workers"" said ""masks work"". 

That's *should* said. Instead, encouraged Americans wear mask all! think Fauci knew masks work, discouraged people wearing (which proof doing), surely behavior disgust you? disgusts me. international scientific organization, remotely independent our, government. recall spokesperson refusing acknowledge even existence Taiway back (i wanna say) March? clear beginning pandemic could entirely trusted job without letting geopolitics get way, rather, governments would let job without exerting influence way found advantageous. Given governments already clearly rejecting science favor politics economics, natural conclusion influence would cause put science back burner favor making gains could within political constraints imposed them.

So no, trust when, early on, said masks work, later, much loudly said masks work, shitty governments started saying masks work. trust said masks work that's horrible advice pandemic. 2003 SARS pandemic, mask use encouraged, helped reduce spread contain outbreak, that's big clue own. that, straight basic science. First all, cost wearing mask basically nothing, potential benefit well worthwhile. secondly, straight filter media works. need maximum pore sizes minimum particle size, electrostatics work. need fancy magic respirator block moisture droplets breath someone else's. [REDACTED] physics. filter works block virus going out, it'll work even better coming in, sucked face. masks magical one way filter material. One way filters really exist like that, certainly make spinning polypropylene amounts industrial cotton candy maker, sticking press, melting parts together.

None requires scientist. one situations basic common sense really work fine. mean, doctors nurses wearing PPE, too. simple.

Ad hominem. sign loser argument. People naturally question stuff üßê Per capita, France worse infection US right now.  Tell reporting covid spin Better?? Scientists mostly agreement official death count undercount, doctors lying every covid death obviously covid death. true seasonal flu, CDC uses mathematical model calculate true number yearly deaths, since counting death certificates would underestimate.

So that's nitpicking, general endorse sentiment listen experts political partisans. we're looking possibly half million total? potentially long term consequences illness. Covid different, evidence besides anecdotal unique long term complications extremely rare... It‚Äôs wooshing, pneumonia lung disease happen another infection like flu covid.... That‚Äôs seems way high. bet like 325k. Thanks Donald!!!!  Trump charge imagine outcome

Yes, actually. April thought *someone* would ring alarm tell start taking seriously. Yes. TL;DR, COVID pneumonia listed death certificate. pneumonia deaths way up, also counted COVID deaths tested positive.

However, deaths occurred indirectly due COVID (people avoiding ER). counted, believe. way tame flu young. Officially? know numbers inflated. one died war years besides war? You‚Äôre still first wave. never stopped. health system overwhelmed

ANY DAY NOW!

""The healthcare system overwhelmed!"" - March... June.. August... Today. point. point much bad shit happened small amount time amd end 2020, number post could easily double Pneumonia deaths unattributed covid-19 spiked normal monthly values, likely many actually covid related.  know wayyyy many people think disappear November 4th. It‚Äôs insane. ex didn‚Äôt leave lesbian. 

She left roid induced anger issues. Lol bad take.  thought joking lmaoo real? need someone tell can't read something. need ""truth keepers"" issue this:

Banks got certain percentage loan amount 'middlemen' helping government loan money companies. Thus, higher loan amount meant bank making money deal. Sadly, meant smaller businesses seeking lower amount aid, attractive big banks.

Plus, government inclined 'speed process', loaning money first audits later. likely happened. Um Trump's rallies? 

It's going tough matter leader, I'm understanding anyone would think Trump it, he's months, shown sort leadership accord. even difficult wear mask rallies frequent golf trips. Yet doesn't. NY/NJ contribute less 25% US deaths now. one point, 40% total deaths. US becoming much less skewed South West went summer surge, states Great Plains Midwest outbreaks well. 

As see state-by-state break down: 15 states + DC 600 deaths per million people (this Italy), 31 states + DC 300 deaths per million people (even rate average Europe). 10 states less 200 deaths per million people, even bottom-placed Alaska still deaths per million people India. States fewer deaths per capita tend growing faster, convergence time, even NY/NJ never overtaken. We‚Äôre page! wanted clarify people reading comments understand fraud likely happen. tired hearing hospitals inflate counts BS morning thread doctors falsifying death certificates. know relative friend heard story. Like hospitals paid via death certificates. added $ adding Covid there. tears came eyes comment get formatted markdown ;( I'm sick people treating one big ""Americans dumb"" joke. fucking heartbreaking! Yeah, understandable stage things like let American citizens without requiring quarantine anything

Hell okay that. weeks Trump fully lucidly explained Bob Woodward serious Covid19 is...weeks international trade shows cancelled. even every American airline carrier already stopped air travel affected areas.

Then Trump issues utterly toothless travel ban made people traveling Wuhan area take overlay flights. folks would sitting even longer packed jetliners airports. walked flights arriving America, screened, issued mandated quarantine orders, nothing.

40,000 people came back US circumstances. Good think anti Vaxer take vaccines. speed things  Would make feel better told countries plenty morons too? louder morons. genuine concern I've going of: believe excess death count manipulated? Lmao yes fucking do. Orlando dude killed motorcycle counted covid death. numbers heavily boosted. kind black mirror helltopia internet supposed substitute society? Social species be....social. Prison suddenly *not be* prison internet, even telephone. 250 Benghazis per day. math, we're 400,000 Congressional inquiry hours behind! Better get crackin took really seriously around june got tired sitting inside day. started making social plans outside only. seemed like lot people got really exhausted around june quit quarantine entirely decided outside visits. friends afraid hang still. 

This month went window Bf went wedding brought covid home him. ok end &amp; atleast knew advance get tested. really. sides aren‚Äôt equal all. It‚Äôs like looking anthill looking mountain saying ‚Äúugh. They‚Äôre since they‚Äôre flat ground.‚Äù

You don‚Äôt think end world, it‚Äôs disingenuous say sides lying equally. coronavirus smoke fires, can't believe fat fuck like still alive. sore throat could smoke. Impending doom intensifies. you‚Äôve died twice vote three times. Trump really say that? ""Officially""... problem don‚Äôt give fuck. coworkers conservatives they‚Äôre CONVINCED covid deaths fake ‚Äúanyone dies past 6 months gets chalked covid‚Äù

They don‚Äôt sources course (besides questionable anecdotes brietbart) truth dead. US! Winning. Honestly pretty mediocre mourn over. focus ending least getting things control.  Nothing else matters. Well can‚Äôt show friends explode microwave, dang it! Remember 10 MILLION prediction? Bill Gates made it. Happy Independence Day! imagine celebrations must canceled though. Kind sucks. people mostly behave themselves? California here, people still wearing masks get shame staying home. tell I'm fool please. look face everyone laughing Obama roasted White House correspondent's dinner.  get sent nursing homes? know answer want see you‚Äôll say first. .06% deaths people 21, amount cussing avoid fact.  Could direction. long border fully closed, people travel, loopholes. Remember people going cruises March April cheap? also remember news Australian post secondary institutions helping international students cheat travel ban, lose tuition... /2xheaddesk saying blame IHME Trump? Dying 85 isn‚Äôt bad That's great got better. nightmare can't see that's problem Yes, exactly. Estimates seem death rate would 10 times flu death rates, implemented measures (which thwir terrible costs). Looking forward vaccine ASAP! too. 

I wonder 8 people like

 ""oh man people really die covid, I'm wearing mask"" 

or like


""I never want dig/ line grave again, I'm wearing mask"" ‚Äúwork‚Äù funded Steve Bannon. It‚Äôs propaganda. Misinformation. Intentional.

One group says don‚Äôt worry another group says it‚Äôs end world sides get caught lying. makes hard believe anything. needs find another owner dogs right she‚Äôs struggling financially till find job place rent.

It‚Äôs case ‚Äúsniffles!‚Äù know... totally fine Covid 3 times worse flu... saying 5-10 times worse... damn facts!!! 

I really trying humorous working well. 

I appreciate knowing accurate information even means worse thought. 

May odds favor.... Totally is. Maybe meant we'd sick whining? personally contracted Covid yet, definitely sick whining that's coming grown man/stable genius. supposed contact tracing, workplace testing, proactive screening hot spots. little happened basically lost interest reached ability test everyone symptomatic. Canada wouldn‚Äôt survive without US. precise, .06% covid deaths people 21. sub deny science claim report false doubt? projecting nutshell. mean know nurse anti-vaxxer so.... prime age adults children beginning lives.
 
Thousands people age 40 died virus, including children. matter? said anything predicting happened? weeks weeks notice January countries hit hard nothing prepare. 6 months since pandemic began US still next nothing. individuals blamed? Yes! Absolutely. ultimately leadership failed us countries clear guidelines strategies keep citizens safe, buried numbers let people die Comparing lighting neighbors house fire ultimate drama move.

You're missing point. original post, said people free make whatever dumb decision want. That's true. choices endanger others, that's laws exist. reason legally wear seatbelt. reason cannot legally go set stuff fire. can't whatever want. laws. someone chooses go nightclub pandemic infect dozens people cause deaths, illegal. think healthcare worker people would understand silly sounds. People get billed times showing ED getting xray. beautifully tragically put. Get dating sites buddy, got long road ahead. Bro it‚Äôs messed up, fair, last week didn‚Äôt feel different, maybe bit tired it, friends caught never Coughed, like normal COVID? tested positive  uses science help brown people 

You forgot pressing reason right hates Gates now. said disparaging thing cult daddy one time. LOT people saying that. Well they‚Äôre anything like dad, they‚Äôll claim Covid numbers grossly inflated hospitals receive federal funding Covid patients, hospitals claiming *everyone* Covid. good! normal sucked anyways. hope lot things change society create new normal. maybe leaders use time rethink run economies world. wondering I'm spending much time effort caring health safety strangers give damn mine.

I hear you. reached point couple weeks ago... I've angry scared heartsick months, finally hit I've spent time grieving complete strangers, honestly help anyone change anything. also realized many (though all) get sick now, knowledge that's available us, blame. emotional energy left feel pain care anyone. I'm sorry nurses, teachers, grocery store workers, bus drivers, etc. whose lives apparently matter people country. Everyone goes partying, spouting conspiracy theories, refusing wear masks (and generally acting like idiots) die miserable death, care. hate fact think way, am, human take much spite carelessness others. Headlines tallying count every every day, someone show astonishment number strange. Unless consumed reddit r covid anything else weeks months. 

No need name calling. Australian emulate China, gets labeled dictator like China, enjoy popular support like China.

Man almost though, sometimes, people make minds actually human rights bullshit We‚Äôre bonus numbers *air horn* Or, know, called act empathy religion help person. Worth pointing out: treatments tested much faster vaccines.. Fuck.  too!!! LoL daughter worked swears food. I've never impressed even bread sticks. I'm gonna die going eat want steak potatoes dinner rolls adult drinks! time, upper limit seemed absurd. 

And arguing time, no, seem absurd. really pissed idiots arguing me. I'm glad admit wrong. can't blame government alone. People still going without masks, spitting road behaving irresponsibly. Government advice us much. take responsibility citizens too. ok ie Australia. weeks closed borders world March, US number one source imported cases. 43 cases time border closure iirc, far away highest source country origin.

But think I'm understand American acquired, rather Chinese people moved Europe America flown Australia /headdesk... Grim milestone late crew ship effectively quarantined, however long ship. traditional, hundreds years ago, ship arriving port disease onboard, could discharge persons passengers 40 days.  ships long passed 40 days. really would safe let people off. People feel fine get tested. News flash: People won‚Äôt listen tell social distance 2 years Well plus Vietnam always historically cautious China almost every reguard. country borders China, they‚Äôre always first hit every single time disease comes China. Therefore, always prepared whatever thing China unleashes next, making Sars, swine, bird whatever infectious diseases dealt record times spread gets wild. noooo 10k people actually died covid!!

covid made government!!

im going wear mask useless!!

the government trying control us sheep!!

you cant tell live life im 24 years old wont get sick haha let go outside without mask!! \*parents get hospitalized\* omg covid real guys stay safe keep telling people wear masks listen me!!

im totally mentally ill!!!

/s

if people made fun exist US would 20 deaths due covid insted 200k remember saying 500k good job. get point, really can‚Äôt summarize California single climate. detailed explanation here


The details presented confirmed individual stacked death certificates, stack paper sixty five feet tall, little bit less roof White House itself.

This could prevented. Shhhhh. Don‚Äôt disrupt fear mongering echo chamber honestly going shit show either way. Either Trump wins left freaks out, protests kick up, things get violent. loses followers dig harder things get violent.

I really see things playing way chaos. hope I'm wrong. Trump virus. What's unofficial actual number now? Woah. Don‚Äôt want edit out. Epic needs 14 days pretty much 100% safe. 7 days, still likely avoid infection after. Germany currently considering shorten quarantine increase compliance likely outweigh rest risk second week. also flu shots now. compared nothing flu, nothing currently covid 19 like third civil war dead it? devastating. I'm even American hurts think losing cousin shit weeks back. leader holding indoor rallies  Good person valuing critical thinking. really hard step away mindset.

Tx kind words. It'll easy one child family relocate desirable degrees/skills. retired kerp cost living same, modest. kid family much likelihood finding equal jobs, likely stay here.

The downside near other. one 2 hours away, lonely relocate. Especially thinking grandkids.  Sure, could be. There's really way know, personally think there's whole lot value spinning wheels trying get accurate number fact matter numbers completely unacceptable _because need high_. consistent, competent leadership and/or sane population gave shit recognizes mortality, could first wave months ago. Instead, are.

Vote. Good person valuing critical thinking. really hard step away mindset.

Tx kind words. It'll easy one child family relocate desirable degrees/skills. retired kerp cost living same, modest. kid family much likelihood finding equal jobs, likely stay here.

The downside near other. one 2 hours away, lonely relocate. Especially thinking grandkids. 200k deaths covid present. 2/3 deaths people morbidities, even people pre existing conditions. small amount deaths people perfectly healthy, 65+ years old. Lol great here. let reddit echo chamber make think otherwise. Reddit mostly teenagers skin game. Didn‚Äôt say 200,000 fall? *Tail wagging intensifies* least mine dont thorns tho idiots get away stuff?

Our banker definitely knows us business provide fairly extensive proof terms accounting records order secure loan.

This absolutely asinine banks throwing money around like clue behind businesses. people smoke anyway there‚Äôs difference eating healthier shutting people‚Äôs source income cases. also one ‚Äúforced‚Äù would us acting ignorant people see news. Trump acting like matter help any, plenty us stressing everything prevent possible spread. anti-masker Americans still stupid realize they're killing countrymen women social distancing wearing masks. 200,000 American deaths. fuck. 1/5 million folks. fuck USA wake up? happens snowballs stop 1 million look back thinking ""wow, remember thought 200,000 lot?"" 

How many lives going take, correct actions finally taken? 

Keep mind 200,000 deaths even including number Americans it, survived, live weaker vulnerable body due effects Covid. guys!!! We‚Äôre number one!!! üòéüá∫üá∏ That's still roughly correct number absence countermeasures.

And recall ever point estimate prediction, rather part plausible range. Schools opening. Gyms opening. Restaurants open. said NYC...the rest state pretty successfully opened, thank god. confirm. European dead Donnie. USA USA MAGA MAGA number ome Google broken? Check out, may wording little pulled memory it‚Äôs close.  ""Officially"" Oh miss good times voted like crazy getting hate mail saying going happen. People actually thought advocating death right. said was, ""without national mask mandate, easily see 100,000 deaths fall."" ok, democracy. 


those responsible punished...oh wait


those responisble least kicked office .... oh wait Speak going outside, Vermont see many people walking business winter summer, wrap control invisible werewolves? I‚Äôve sewing masks giving away free don‚Äôt emotional bandwidth anyone know get sick. you‚Äôre telling hangovers involved? get queasy hand sanitizer smells much like bottom shelf buy-it-by-the-gallon booze. Nooooooope. Wearing two masks on. That's still roughly correct number absence countermeasures. death rate proper treatment slightly lower that, health system overwhelmed, death rate little higher. *salutes* oo say see....by dawns..*single tear* Almost quarter million people dead, yet people saying flu actively wearing mask ‚Äúmy rights hoax‚Äù, pathetic ‚Äúpatriots‚Äù  lying, unlikely U.S. Pfizer CEO thinks may data end October, time Oct 22 meeting. 10/31-11/3 interesting. Moderna optimistic end October well. Americans unwilling change lifestyle. 200k easily preventable ""muh freedom"" rightt!? Instead loved ones. acquaintances. strangers they‚Äôre close proximity with. Exactly Nobody cares. 

Look around you. Nobody sick, hurt dying. fraud almost over.  Leeetttssss goooo boys #1 understand global supply chain well. advocating, here, hold China higher standard. 

They *legit* mfgrs HUGE disservice allowing *counterfeit poor QC* products taint reputation.

I never ""huur durr must made america!"" person...but last couple years (and ESPECIALLY COVID world) dramatically increased skepticism products buy China. Gather whole lot truckers deport Mexico... need them. let nice Mexicans :)  anyone done math number things continue trend time vaccine readily available? original worst case scenario. What's current one? wasted you. Shame. Common sense common. start basics since seem lacking critical thinking skills regurgitate read reddit: 

1. 12k H1N1 number confirmed deaths? 

2. Covid-19 number confirmed deaths?

If answer super simple questions I'll cut slack grieving person, +/- life expectancy really matters.

Fuckin' yikes. Oh crap forgot U.S corporate socialist nation omg again! shoutout people using complacency get hell kill count. we'll 1 million next year  magically went away.

The pandemic?

No, life America. dentist murdered me. They‚Äôre tell you!  Hah.
 
Bossa Nova makes want sit listen. 

So thanks Brazil! true? cite that?  Stalin quote Hell yeah, new personal best. WEAR GOD-DAMNED MASK. it!  like watching sped version climate change.... get people still claim like flu. 

Because President large parts Federal Government outright lying it. hard get. sort inducements did.

""Hey, would like get vaccine save life MONTHS anyone else chance get it?""
Seems like great ""inducement"" me! ‚ÄúWe surprised overall rate patients return need admission, twice illnesses,‚Äù Kilaru explained. ‚ÄúThe concern emergency physicians making wrong decisions, rather Covid unpredictable turn severe rather quickly.‚Äù

The purpose information doctors know expect make better decisions regarding patient care. reflect bad decisions hospital sending home, mean 9 10 people okay. means sometimes disease flares days initial visit, sometimes doesn't. lost ‚Äú genetics shows ‚Äú

Says American electorate. guess administrators get paid like Egyptian Pharaohs trying let taxpayers see unneeded are. ...[with million well to. I'm sorry snark. friends medical science research get little defensive people act like accomplished anything based feeling rather looking up. 

I'm actually supportive people saying things like ""Could tell this?"" like comes across ""I looked this, pretty sure know answer."" r/funnybutstupid. virus can't travel six feet, get China?! Checkmate. Must nice feel anxiety world crumbing around you. Part jealous. That's alot motorcycle accidents, people laid rest previously, various fruits farm animals People tired though. lot people know taking seriously March it. 3 different neighbors house parties last weekend I‚Äôm waiting pop street.  people think kids won‚Äôt get sick spread virus due believing bad information. may also believe death statistics matter ignore reality getting sick long term effects. 0.06% population There's reason he's job whole decade.

He's kind compassionate great social media team.

Americans read freedom lenses complain he's saving lives temporary. fairly easy refute claims, exercise futility nothing get people. common anti-lockdown talking points try equate common viral infections SARS-CoV-2 based whether virus ""can"" cause certain complication. However, rates complications see SARS-CoV-2 much higher see common viral infections like influenza. something like influenza, see maximum 10% (and that's stretch...rates ranged 1-10% depending study). SARS-CoV-2, studies suggested 60%, occurring even asymptomatic mild cases. 

To say another virus ""can"" lead certain complication, therefore, SARS-CoV-2 loses novelty shortsighted.

Edit:. percents refer cases myocarditis. help denialism? didn‚Äôt coordinate shutdown. State governors like DeSantis said didn‚Äôt know asymptomatic spread thing, several months pandemic. Mask use social distancing politicized properly enforced throughout time. Testing capacity speed ramped sufficiently means production act. Contact tracing taken seriously enough.

A competent administration would done everything possible address factors. instead let chaos reign. 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic killed estimated 50 million worldwide (the population-adjusted equivalent *200 million* today), including 675,000 Americans (the population-adjusted equivalent *2 million* today). unlike current virus targets overwhelmingly old sick, Spanish Flu's victims included many children otherwise-healthy young high people younger 5 years old, 20-40 years old, 65 years older. high mortality healthy people, including 20-40 year age group, unique feature Idk bruh. know google? 600 000 US 2020 isn‚Äôt happening isn‚Äôt closer lowest estimates. many deaths 2 co-morbidities? Fauci recommended Vitamin C/D supplements. I'm normally big ""take vitamins"" guy (I usually try get vitamins sufficiently diverse food), go sun often, taking vitamin regularly Let‚Äôs see, can‚Äôt spell Nobel, can‚Äôt guess proper coast 50/50 shot, accusing blaming party (perceived) failures another, Trump brought reason, thanks clearing reason you‚Äôre well educated politics. can‚Äôt wait Trump gone people like find politics boring drop discussion entirely instead coming shitting everything sake it. Yeah, go destroy credibility approved vaccines. like large number vaccine-deniers already. virus can't travel 91 miles 6 feet. FDA‚Äôs top policy official LOWELL SCHILLER left agency, worked issues like drug importation recently Covid-19 guidance.

@ScottGottliebMD, originally hired Schiller, calls ‚Äúone creative effective policymakers‚Äù many new would closed anyways?

If rules uncivil. shitty way learn much put bottom line.

They seriously fought joke sourced masks whole time fought providing masks, awful.

But she‚Äôs gone sweet lady, tear ducking head idiots stand way right thing, one gotten sick work since masking went place it‚Äôs net win. I'm guessing wear masks either. Victorian, support dans approach hope get end soon. perfect least he's reacting fast trying fix things.   Come America better.

*does intentionally worse spite Canada* Wonder tsar's daughter doing. didn‚Äôt. Individual states shut country whole not. needed strong federal response leadership top clearly have. still amateurs compared NY. America ultimate breeding ground COVID, literally much could done. national healthcare well developed social systems state mandated paid sick leave people wont stay home job depends it. America would needed complete restructuring able cope well virus. mention many Americans anti-science masks seen democrat propaganda, leading non-compliance.

Republicans see masks democrat propaganda work.

Democrats see masks panacea pretend like mask wearing need do.

Under right leadership might bad, would still really, REALLY bad.

America needs completely revamp social security network healthcare system. Scratch that. America needs completely get rid 2 party system well. need complete governmental reform. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs POS different opinions.‚Äù

Is absolute statement people general? mean, I‚Äôm sure murderer different opinion killing people. Point is, morals matter. AMERICA #1 source ""covid deaths inflated"" claims?

That's cool, I'm interested arguing child prioritizes feelings facts. Run along. Yeah, I'm hearing emergency sirens city reopened. reopened public pools parks, people came together like nothing happened. businesses started closing again, wonder why. relocate Canadian border? getting closer closer number innocent people lost lives criminal iraq war , thanks God keep good work üôè impression, least BC, citing studies like one showed hospital staff (in vietnam think?) likely get sick SARS wearing simple surgical mask staff wore none all. 

They didn‚Äôt know much, Bonnie Henry still tells us remember masks last resort least effective barrier, (after distancing hand washing) day. Doesn‚Äôt sound like lie sounds like used information had, got new information changed tune‚Äîand barely.

I remember early press conferences switched pro-mask, weren‚Äôt barrelling confidence, said ‚Äúnew information shows might help.‚Äù 

Trying encourage people lie exactly get anti-maskers. yet another marketing stunt.

missing critical elements; identify antibody, titer, control, outcome, safety, etc.

how come allowing junk published? full three week shutdown, followed mask mandates, contact tracing.

We could given every man, woman child america $200/day stay home month current cost corporate bailout, economy would fine, 200,000 people would alive. 

That's basically New Zealand did, gotten sick, economy relatively fine, naysayers fuck right off. american economic recovery plan cooked congress primarily looting public funds billionaires. 

Congresscritters whitehouse knew start solution ensure economic recovery chose favor actions line pockets. could even ensured american economic recover *and* lined pockets, chose line pockets. infuriating. WHO. US surgeon general well. Hah thats good idea. Next time discuss bring one up.  dems would back abortion gun grabbing would get board wont.......that said punching state rep (real knuckle dragger stirring anti-maskers up) would US really enforce lockdown, pesky bill rights? guys get rid shit. /s

We forced choose staying home protesting.  Canada well, US election causes things go shit it‚Äôs possible husband work lives turned upside down. border doesn‚Äôt really protect us. posted entire quote link. think 'hoax' he's referring Dems holding accountable inaction generally terrible leadership, dramatically increased death count. think calling virus hoax. However, definitely minimized effects virus, Dems called it, doubled claim. Now, 200,000 Americans dead, decent chunk could avoided sound policy. Trump's quoted words make look fool, regardless interpretation reasonably pulled them. covid killed them. ""people underlying conditions"" high risk group since started. I'm sure point is. testing consistently shown 10x many actual cases confirmed cases. 6 million cases 200,000 deaths, antibody testing factored in, 60 million actual cases. Herd immunity shown require 50% population get virus, would result 500,000 deaths. But, so, we'd avoid mass suicides isolation, mass starvation every unemployed person runs money, devastating degradation quality life everyone due economic collapse (which 100% blamed forcing businesses close). GUYS Wow, rude. asking question. ‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù vast, vast majority excess deaths happened late March, April, early May.

That suggests mostly due COVID infection. due causes, see excess death rate increase function lockdown time, saw opposite. cares? Profits investors shareholders matters. America getting vaccine conjunction population. We'll among first get back normal. offense, hard overstate bad take is.

The 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic killed estimated 50 million worldwide (the population-adjusted equivalent *200 million* today), including 675,000 Americans (the population-adjusted equivalent *2 million* today). unlike current virus targets overwhelmingly old sick, Spanish Flu's victims included many children otherwise-healthy young high people younger 5 years old, 20-40 years old, 65 years older. high mortality healthy people, including 20-40 year age group, unique feature Czech R. it. Funny disease inflicted damage China's greatest threat (US India).

Also funny world rushing restock supply, also China greatest beneficiary disease.

lol everyone wearing mask first month shit over. Where's victim? Oh, isn't? terrorist organization problem. But, capable grasping anything outside masters tell you, so, never understand anything besides ""government said it, hurr Durr."" Tyrants love people like you, question anything told, like good slave. much whataboutism....stay topic. conclude first topic start new one like. 

I still waiting response thoughts 5 governors killed tens thousands sending infected elderly back nursing home took responsibility actions. Yeah exactly.

For dad great test show mask effectiveness. spit mirror home. wipe away. wear mask. spit mirror. look better, same, worse mask on.

He immediately see masks block droplets.

Also, surgeons nurses wear surgery block droplets landing inside patients operated on. silly doctors nurses dress-up masks work? think hospitals probably try approve much possibly based person‚Äôs insurance. insurance covers 3 days, go three days, probably try avoid making patients pay anything isn‚Äôt covered know won‚Äôt collect money, believe intentionally try squeeze much insurance money possible. think word I‚Äôm looking ‚Äúinflated.‚Äù Example hospital stay might cost grand charge insurance 50k. That‚Äôs problem. Medicaid prenegotiated hospital stay ventilator 39k, agreed. they‚Äôre private insurance probably charge full price insurance bill customer remaining portion. Coronavirus likes this. got flu shot yet without feeling like Charlie horse arm day after. don‚Äôt think could successfully anymore, due many people believe it‚Äôs hoax. virus got really hand percentage people playing virus dropped could possible.  Yeah reading treatment today brought hospital admission chances 1.2% like 5.2% remember [this article came early March.  Fauci said, ""you want go war president . . . got walk fine balance making sure continue tell truth.""

This March 3. root entire problem. Fauci unable tell unvarnished truth keep job. whole fact trying ""balance"" telling truth something else tell us something culture government currently functions.  Truth critical factor. also committed crimes humanity removing reproductive capabilities women guilty crime seeking peaceful asylum.  American barbarism finest allergic opiates (thank god) people dying taking fake Xanax, it‚Äôs found cocaine, weed, fentanyl active small amounts could kill someone don‚Äôt clean sifters making cut leave microscopic amount table. Reddit came handy, saw comments advising people use masks even CDC publicly saying necessary unless sick. Spanish-speaking countries seem struggling lately, wonder why. Yikes! 200,000 Americans dead 6 months points worth addressing. Needs federal legislation that. It‚Äôs producers certain states prefer like is.

If gets federal legality cheap CA weed going put lot producers states business. Given first go bankrupt fires burning weed. stay inside groceries delivered. 

The rest us gunna celebrate New Years. hate little. Cuomo sending infected patients nursing homes help. Let's real, world uneducated idiots around bedroom. long, taking throne US. take account passing others. 10 years now, brains fully developed, they'll realize passing others means put others lives risk may led death another. percentage loved ones, given many go commuter schools average college student 91 miles away home likely visit home. Add unknown risks long term effects think statement lacks full consideration consequences. college way? interested addressing actual point, nitpicking dumb internet logic. nothing worse stale peeps. many aspects event, early communications really create confusion, resistance, doubt. 

The initial model U.K. used estimate deaths WAY off. original directive masks wouldn‚Äôt help CDC Fauci putting Covid positive people retirement homes. 

So many mistakes. Tests done hospitals near 90% accurate. read Wikipedia page? covers huge array examples including several major examples would listed Covid induced strokes organ failure. 

The point making ""50 years"" claim plenty 30-40 year old coronavirus comorbidity listed death certificates. decades literally letallity rate flu, basic science. 

You're going need cite this. I've read plenty medical studies indicate SARS-CoV-2 10 times lethal regular flu. know getting number from. players given option opt-out retain scholarships eligibility, aren‚Äôt forced playing. 

A scholarship athlete big time college football basketball program rent, food, travel paid (this includes flights back home) addition scholarship. get state art amenities world class medical treatment. notion since aren‚Äôt paid cash, exploited way imo. 

Football &amp; Basketball programs supplement schools entire athletics department budgets. players paid cash, virtually every school would cut non-football &amp; basketball programs, would disproportionately affect female college athletes would also violation title IX. Even Europe agrees draconian lockdown measures bad idea, despite rebound No, deliberately knowingly harming others would knowing infected yet still acting way. 

Now merely know given right (or better say wrong) circumstances might that, basically normal. almost everything might harm someone something goes wrong. start chain events ending someone harmed.  Seriously. It‚Äôs done almost much harm masks.   guys!! Yup they‚Äôre morons deniers reading left wing media must open let California light inside body Science fine headlines like one absolutely intended make go ‚Äúoh shit WHAT?‚Äù click know expect stroke...

They‚Äôre issue. Why? starting sound like deranged anti-vaxer ""tell parents whose child got crippled vaccine!!!"".

Sure, happens. rare considered statistically insignificant tragic is. america broken. doesnt matter president is. im glad people seeing this. structural integrity problem. dont work together anymore. nothing ONE man woman fix. dont efficient systems, infrastructure crumbling, specialist centers thing, congress useless selfish. people selfish, arrogant overworked stressballs. couple together whole ""fuck you!! WANT! FREEDOMS! AMERICA!!"" argument? might well country wild west. every man himself

this country's disaster response UTTERLY terrible. overall arrogance thinking ""the best"" dooms us time. instead living, trying efficiently us, would rather focus BEST living, number 1!! rather making efficient system, number 1 would result perfectly fit together efficiently working system.

unless tackle problems? things get better  Yes I'm tired CDC apologists forum full shit claim cdc never lied. Yes there's dumbasses still listened, change fact reasonable people wear one beginning cdc lied said work general population. agree, thanks pointing clarity.  Yes go NZ, Canada want referring hospital care received end infected. See? It‚Äôll magically go away. kids. Americans SPECIAL type stupid, they? one hoard vaccine exist yet? Also, hoard first place? I'm sure vaccine start used immediately production. Hoarding would needlessly delay amount people vaccinated. Fauci's great, like him, reason one say lie careful wording, thr messaging really far public concerned.

In February, KNEW asymptomatic spread issue, [he look masks buy drug store, leakage around really much protect you,"" said. ""People start saying, 'Should start wearing mask?' Now, United States, absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask.

That first line incredibly damaging accompanied discussion masks drugstore prevent spread. 

And second line wrong. know Fauci knew, can't say lying, masks mid February. intentionally wrong.  seemed work italy Got source that?  I'm sure are, surely ""seriously considering"" moving four years ago. Actually interestingly enough seems like young people care lot climate change, since actually apocalyptic issue. saying COVID isn‚Äôt issue, end COVID civilization ending event. Agreed. posted really fence... additional thought comment u/zuzabomega think I'm going pull it, real added value. disease deadly end day kill less 0.1% world's population.  No, preexisting. no, I‚Äôm fat COVID kills me, still COVID killed me.  work Healthcare blows mind  afraid people would selfish buy N95 respirators desperately needed hospitals‚Ä¶ created narrative masks worthless UNLESS you‚Äôre one sick.

Are implying Fauci part narrative?? stage 0 totally treatable, stressful meantime. Thankfully treatment 3-4 weeks, can't imagine pay long - term. Hindsight 2020. pun intended. GuYs Well, shit. Heat smoke two ideas had, anyone got anything else? virus running rampant europe like us? Aren‚Äôt people kind forced go missions Cuban government gets payment countries help? asking, something I‚Äôve heard would love get clarified someone knows.ü§î hospital pushed back mask policy nearly month, supply wife coworkers masks month (Professionals paid us back shared cost materials Techs Aids).

Honestly wife far busy research own, one look evidence based medicine orgs trust.

Now hospital act weeks mask recommendation came down, doubt due threat losing wife particularly rare highly needed speciality, really could used bit research masks decades ago. Indeed. _still_ doesn‚Äôt make villain story. Folks gotta understand isn‚Äôt black-and-white, mistakes, matters follow up. Fauci lied, also lot good. It‚Äôs complicated. Don‚Äôt start turf war now, guys.

Without Fauci, US would worse shape is. wish admin empathetic towards people fuck‚Äôs sake.

_BTW I‚Äôm WHO/CDC apologist. look comments thread you‚Äôre unsure. ;)_ making point focusing saving lives isn‚Äôt resonating. reality lockdown months ago would prevented deaths helped economy didn‚Äôt happen. Mucia....fuck yea. What's worse? Death or, living rest live lung problems, heart problems, brain damage? reopen now? Yeah. Humans religious. eject one faith profess faith, almost certainly unwittingly picked something else new faith core doctrines new set heretics persecute eradicate. predictable. Thinking them. understand. Lots people that. Thinking family...? people careful family might risk. lied one half brain underestimated it.
He‚Äôs super diplomatic knows truth. spell disaster you! battleground reson Belgium still ahead count differently US. need look excess deaths since countries doesnt count way. countries undercount actually deaths per capita report are, US, Netherlands Portugal. 

Other countries report many example Belgium. 
[Now old numbers gives idea cant trust reported covid wait...it magically disappear! 
Right?  need mask..right? I'll drink lysol.  That's sitting president told us do.  disagree. Germany‚Äôs culture better suited impacted hard. Spain Italy way multigenerational households. Eating large groups important part culture. got spread way quicker vulnerable parts society.

The lockdown Germany super relaxed compared Spain still relaxed. Yet Spain way stronger second wave.  going trial? We've gotten different impression Tegnell, Swedish media Swedes lately. Ever taken vaccine? It‚Äôs perfectly normal minor side effects injection. What‚Äôs fuss it? BOYS! That's total bullshit. anything deaths reported.

Take look states sudden surge ""pneumonia"" deaths.

You source talking ass.  Anti-maskers everywhere, it‚Äôs matter society government them.

That's fair. sort matches point trying get at: Yes, health authorities flip-floped masks. even make argument told neccesary lie back spring, order conserve medical supplies.

... despite case everywhere world, US currently nation serious political discord masks. can't really blamed WHO. shows important them. Ok understand struggle yes real hope you‚Äôre ok. said right vaccine hoard. Secondly there‚Äôs still question percentage population actually take vaccine, top seems vaccine work 50/60% people actually take vaccine. Life isn‚Äôt going back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù awhile, said doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt continue improve become normal. Wearing mask distancing crucial mainly avoiding confined spaces like restaurants place masks worn. don‚Äôt think people realize festivals, full football stadiums, events like won‚Äôt back til least 2022, maybe 20% capacity full on. I've learned anything year, especially reddit, people still highly religious replaced core religions diffuse circles influence online. Fear death seems drive much traditional religion. *half* year. Doesn‚Äôt Spain currently worst outbreak Europe?  Today society driven narcissistic feeling, think happens right worst thing humanity suffered ever. Ah, deaths recovery cases must wrong then. personal anecdotal experience totally overrides facts numbers. I'm saying work even one mingled. problem still present Canada. anecdotal experience BC, pretty much half people wearing masks. one taking seriously. *half* year. everyone knows, buy Naloxone (Narcan) without prescription pharmacies across US. insurance covers it. many opioid crisis centers provide doses free. GoodRx coupons 60% retail price without access insurance, please pass info along friends family. Many us love someone uses drugs. numbers lie! punish people mingle households?  Well put take time really internalize what‚Äôs happening little empathy. add perspective though, around 3 million people die US every year. Arguably similar amounts tragedy felt families 3 million year. much empathy situation make person waste away completely. It‚Äôs natural let emotions tied close family friends, we‚Äôre simply wired emotionally capable caring millions people. agree loading fair. 

US Surgeon General
""They effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus...""  Insist big, huge hug likely last Christmas many spend grandparents. Buddy showed stats: 80% tested asymptomatic - that's fact.
While point missing 80 cases every one detected valid, study taken May, suburb Mumbai already quite lot infections. can't take Dharavi's results apply India.
Trust me, understand point. know people died Covid. understand government diverting attention drama. say handled well wrong: aim never control cases. control deaths.
When say this, lot people ask lockdown implemented. lockdown preparation, prevention.
Trust me, I'm fan present government. response Covid-19 nothing good. WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1!
U-S-A U-S-A U-S-A U-S-A We're number one!!! Wait... Pfizer collaborating BioNTech, German vaccine developer. BioNTech mRNA technology. Since Europe safely playing soccer without fans fine, right? peep Reddit soccer matches resumed. dumb Americans trying play sports must condemned! ok, bill gates needs stop talking virus vaccine already REALLY looks like he's pushing something. Also, he's helping feeding whole ""bill gates pushing force vaccinations"" conspiracy...

for sake? shutup lol Italy mandatory since March lockdown reopenings late April/early May. Spain too. effective measure avoid new lockdowns. 

I think heading direction. Daily testing scaled roughly 10x early stages. numbers today include asymptomatic carriers. People wait 3 weeks diagnosis. Treatments improved. Caution fragile groups high. consequence Covid ICU stay went average 22 days 8 days.

Ultimately lockdown consequence severely stressed overloaded healthcare system. least here, there's sign today position prevent it. Ultimately, people! Lmao, classic American response.

""Fuck you, got mine""

You personally well negate fact America shithole. Believe not, there's people 3rd world countries also well. Republicans still claim voted election.  important new data information becomes available citizens data revaluated, outside politics.

This video provides important view bigger picture look situation always available beyond scary headlines.

I one know correlation country previous flue season impact Corona virus mean 180? 360 would get direction.

Basically saying American culture self centred effectively combat virus like this. Yeah, let's repeat greatest policy mistake history. Lol.  hate Tucker Carlson fire thousand suns! probably one free awards given idiot! supposed get medical information computer software developer! Best case, 2% population. 6 million America.

The fatality rate 5% while, it‚Äôs dropping slowly get testing in. worst case, 15 million deaths. Since update concerns 4 days, means 200 cases per day.

Apparently go away smoke either. getting 97 figure August September? Maybe died died Covid! That's statistics dangerous - almost never used properly... knows truth is, definitely title implies said. pandemic close over. projected hit 400k deaths year end... Deaths continuing steady pace many factors playing increase (schools opening example). span 6 months information important still screw matter what. Really need add Trump‚Äôs quotes Woodard timeline drive home knew compared public responses. Remember like 15 cases would one day ""just disappear like miracle?"" bit ridiculous. Everyone consider personal situation, local environment, city, state kinds protocols precautions take get virus. case family, social isolating sense go parties, invite people over, etc. go breakfast brunch twice week. son go planetfitness gym nearly every day, grocery store every day, etc. BUT, local city mask mandate restrictions restaurant capacity gym restrictions capacity well. 

I also developed series supplements protocols based research plan implement family get symptoms respiratory virus. 

&amp;#x200B;

But friend never goes house, orders groceries delivered, go restaurants gyms. 

Is stressed fearful? Almost assuredly based conversations had. family feel current lifestyle, limited compared previously, one sustain many months without suffering much stress mental ill health. NY still new infection rate 25 per 100,000. country, would tied Russia Venezuela new infections. idea NY past first wave laughable. Awesome. Awesome max.

/s seem leaning instead fighting it.

Flattening curve... Vertically ""It'll just...disappear!"" I've noticed people saying less. hanging onto idea people die. 
As okay 200k+ people dying Karen go bowling eating Olive Garden friends Saturday night. Gona million Trump wins end 5th year. Yeah I'm thinking. get amount bit, cdc estimates since 2017 year. watched event photo live - randomly came YouTube another video - really wish guy running Florida. He‚Äôs safe things compassionate intelligent understands messaging extremely well. One thing notice doubt comes health advisor keeps identifying Victorian refers others Victorians, good subliminal way drum community spirit, making issue local specific matter community health pride.

He never calls anyone Australian. bit both. Medical capacity really really shit totally unprepared pandemic, 3 month lockdown things amped majorly we're able save lot people dying. said, infra count COVID deaths properly. Trump soon. 

""Just stop dying. Simple."" Exactly least say ""almost 200,000"" guess. predicted hit 400,000 end year. Idk Trump rally's calculated that. Remember president said ""we'll keep numbers 1 2""?

I do. Lmao ‚ÄúOne day it‚Äôll disappear, like miracle‚Äù Meanwhile, I'm hearing people around asserting overcounted. Hospitals reporting deaths any/unknown causes covid deaths, etc, get funding.  another cunt. Thats like 12k dead every day?  Listen, put accurate number things let‚Äôs realistic; there‚Äôs good portion country feel 200k way 20k, guaranteed however high number gets won‚Äôt change thing them.  I‚Äôve fighting battle far long. explained Medicaid, government sponsored program paying thousands illness that‚Äôs covered program. mean doctors going commit fraud something pays more, like brain surgeries run six figures pop, unnecessary hospitalizations? oh yeah let‚Äôs commit fraud risk losing license 13k 39k ventilator...

There‚Äôs denying cost covered Medicaid, believe hospitals committing petty theft(in grand scheme things) silly. it! ...? acting like I'm going evasive? course true. report referencing one said 6% death listed solely COVID. mean 6% deaths due COVID. 

Think way. AIDS actually causes death people get HIV. Gaming HIV makes people susceptible secondary infections. really say 0% claimed AIDS deaths due AIDS, rather, pneumonia, etc? No, AIDS got pneumonia. 

It's thing COVID. Lack oxygen brain anything nazis use shoddy covid care Fake news  Crazy know...  guy needs resign, period. one forcing leave house all.. dont wear mask. public still aware 1918 Flu October. Liberty Loan Parade Philadelphia went ahead full force, caused ton cases (and deaths).

Meanwhile, whole country's fighting year. might see cases rise since weather's getting colder people indoors more, sudden jump like century ago. first time logging reddit?

I'm asking mean churning away months, months, slowly desensitizing people. OMG, 200K lives it, mean.... also unusual here(from Indonesia), families help dig graves family members. Digging graves creepy taboo, actually feel like manual labor. get TM common flu shot too. doesn‚Äôt seem significant comparison amount cases honest. Ok. Yea sure either.   point I'd wear mask end days meant could send children school go concert. make America great again? great number deaths mind right?   Tbh didnt think virus stress   Anywhere back large group vulnerable located. awards wtf disagree person tragedy. people died voted Trump get respect pity. them, hundreds thousands people would sick dead. people refused wear masks social distance died it. celebrating deaths? No. truly give fuck die wear fucking mask vote incompetent president history.  far deaths still fairly low. yes know there's around 2-4 week delay deaths France rising around month half since beginning August far rise deaths marginal increase. Spain they've rising since mid July around 2 months rise deaths also marginal increase. reason look like rise deaths following trajectory cases like saw US cases started rise significantly deaths followed month later correct. Thanks much! could wrong think flu figures based fiscal year (like September - August) rather January - December year. 

If counted way know answer question flu season begins / underway. Guests also could‚Äôve socially distanced wore masks, sounds like neither.  ‚ÄúThe oranges. Oranges the...‚Äù Micheal osterholm Yeah can't really estimate I'm sure. Party when? talking airborne aerosol different.

Are trying make point ignore deaths prior knowledge? really don‚Äôt know anything. even US? everybody! USA USA USA Actually gotten away already 

I‚Äôll surprised actually stand trial this. Doubt yeah half inch away punching fuck boss going ""its flu....muh economy.......GOP jeeeeeeeeebus"". mom GF SEVERAL health problems trying asshole brings home......Oh Republican actually paid attention science class. that‚Äôs always battle me. engage constructively without becoming ‚Äúcrazy liberal guy‚Äù real goal point disinformation That‚Äôs disingenuous case. People need aware. Masks work. cautious. Reconsider groups. flu.  much winning, right? Maybe played cartoons sold weed. year, mean, general sports bars always like taking test me. I'm trying avoid getting shot next week. want risk fever since need temperature checked office. Mine 330k minimum december bleach comment. many college Coronavirus cases hospitalized? I'm sure number given hard stat. I've seen ranges, highest estimate last 10 years looks 61,000. [This month ago, figures probably much worse right buzzfeed joke Lanes opening highway -Bill Burr amount reason persuade people, even mothers. It‚Äôs going sound like incredibly biased answer, it‚Äôs truth. Fox News hijacked power-viewers‚Äô emotional centers control opinions fear anger. Watch one episode Sean Hannity Tucker Carlson count number hypothetical implied controversies throw meant invoke fear/anger response. Well they're allowed college experience wanted even point going spending money so? Might well go back home go community college. That's literally story. Mom Dad, went college week time life, that's allowed anymore, they've sent home. conservative parents new line ""oh said gonna 3 million"" Hospitals already near capacity many areas theres worry Take easy he's Wisconsin. son-in-law believes hospital conspiracy. Sometimes feel like beating wet pool noodle. Pepperidge Farms losing customer base pandemic. Never said was, trying guess user‚Äôs think many people comply? I've heard lot frustration people sacrificed spring, followed rules self quarantined, watch LOT people ignore go living life normal. another state wide lockdown I'm sure many people comply feeling like got screwed last time.  cited study said could 2.2 million, good job Unfortunately, many must die. grew era Vietnam heartily sick body count long Americans take it. work like that. Certain segments population going higher rates (and certain segments would lower rates). College students party take seriously might 90% herd immunity middle aged office workers work home might like 5% come contact many people. 

 also see lot variation small groups. I‚Äôd get worked societal issues I‚Äôd told stop looking beyond front door doesn‚Äôt effect me.

Umm that‚Äôs caring member society think?! add deaths suicides, medical delays, lockdown-related causes probably get pretty close surpass 200,000. 60 80 percent people social work outside home? Trump‚Äôs tweets ‚Äúliberate‚Äù states shut say otherwise. Whatever attempts made fight covid done spite Trump, him. Even much vaunted travel shutdown supporters love point shown idea all, contrary claims. see ‚Äúthings could handled better‚Äù maybe aren‚Äôt deep cult. thats case, look deeper epic failures, lying, finger pointing, ulterior motives, spectacular ignorance science, maybe you‚Äôll see feel way do. Paraphrasing another comment mine, thought relevant here:

The US suffering human toll (in absolute values) higher Civil War WWII combined

* Civil War: 655K dead 4-year period - **\~164K per year**
* WWII: 405K dead 3.5-year period - **\~116K per year**
* COVID-19: 200K dead 0.5 year period - \~**400K per year** I‚Äôm even talking rules, mean common sense. part, friends wearing masks following concrete rules. But, something allowed doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs best choice. country threw collective tantrum everything closed, reopened. obviously say risk mitigated advisable go out. So, yeah, it‚Äôs totally allowed eat restaurants I‚Äôm not. You‚Äôre allowed 10 people get-together, I‚Äôm not. seems obvious things ill-advised even though permitted.  giver props keeping dogs. agree. America lost collective mind 9/11 3500. fuck 200,000 steadily climbing. It‚Äôs many think it‚Äôs #. remember 6 months ago reading possibility 40k American lives lost. number commonly told worst case scenario.

Zero leadership yeah it‚Äôs hypocritical people use death count way prove point

god hate reddit sometimes Ok that‚Äôs fine people arguing aren‚Äôt going either Makes sense. Many people highest work/lifestyle risk getting already gotten now.

EDIT: Obviously mean loosen restrictions much, everyone else enters high risk group. PhD thesis on? worst 2.5 million  I'm shocked got traction here! Looking overlays cases deaths staggering deaths longer follow case curve, even remotely close. 2nd waves raging across Europe deaths even move. interesting, something going on. Treatments? Younger crowd getting it? Mass testing? problem assuming pre-existing immunity 1. There's actual evidence, circumstantial speculation noted one authors paper assumption based on. 2. explained heterogenous dispersion. 

To points, we're 15% right now. Assuming 43% per dispersion model, looking 500-600K dead anyway. That's acceptable. 

The problem ""protect elderly,"" argument practical policy translates ""Let elderly protect themselves."" Old people still work, get groceries, deal reckless relatives, etc. Workers still interlope nursing care homes, bringing virus them, we've seen states supposedly attempted protect care homes. And, since argument seems based empirical speculation, let's look empirically. country shown proficient outside ones directly pursued containment. empirical evidence done exist.

The heterogenous dispersion model informative show. optimal case ride along peak slowly, lowering ultimate HIT burns out. second best case Sweden type mild restrictions, even works better lockdown, open early, let rip scenario. Changing course would lead even worse outcome many states managed keep things relative control vs. slowly lifting restrictions. discussing those, certainly agree anecdotes make data.

other people using shit information make evidence better though. course return normal life, added risk. Remember everybody shocked hear number? People told drive hundreds miles away get tested. ***Sick*** people. Kids losing week school awaiting tests. Health care workers missing work awaiting tests. saying US better (it isn‚Äôt; it‚Äôs worse) thought Boris wasn‚Äôt bad. links compiled somewhere lockdown skeptic subreddit forum they've reposted death. Pre-prints suggest may possible somehow herd immunity might lower conventional rate COVID19.

Meanwhile, time seroprevalence rates surpass 20%, bad things happen. TY, showed top news queue.  ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre terrible reporter.‚Äù ... members Hatfield family final moments 83-year-old patriarch, Gary, FaceTime call. Utah nursing home wouldn‚Äôt let kids grandkids inside see fear spreading disease.   US suffering human toll (in absolute values) higher Civil War WWII combined

* Civil War: 655K 4-year period - **\~164K per year**
* WWII: 405K 3.5-year period - **\~116K per year**
* COVID-19: 200K 0.5 year period - \~**400K per year**

Sure, death toll percentage total population lower, trying put roses turd? Crazy mass mortality normalized That‚Äôs hospital data. said cases deaths skeptical. cases deaths reported state California. asked would state California engaged conspiracy lower cases deaths ""Only 200,000 deaths. win!"" US, watch learn! still much better March April? Good know. think reason still wait 14 days could contracted virus day plane show tests 14 days. That's thing insidious. Modern marriage comes consequences. Lowering deaths preventing deaths entirety thing. 

Never said However, Corona **claim many lives simply [prevention treatment] **lower deaths**

are contradictory statements Downvotes sinophobia. Well done, progressive Reddit :) hate state this. :( First wave already over? isn't.  post satire? advised also increase children low apgar scores Nah, 'caring' business group make dialysis centers akin gym Starbucks pop one every street corner, least US. Fall coming.... might even double that. USA #1 Lowering deaths preventing deaths entirety thing. lower amount people still die prevent it. dispute much want way is. I‚Äôm mean look data. suddenly dips Trump started rerouting data.   Pardon though, absolutely death sentence many people. Unlike flu seasons ever there‚Äôs research show it.  Thank guys Praise, us USA it. keep good work show world.

USA #1 USA #1 USA #1  September 9th. 3,116 new cases today 146 new deaths reported today. That‚Äôs feel well. Tired constant fear-mongering focus negative.

Keep faith get this. :) Lots stuff slowing already Covid hit international sector especially anything tied China Italy That's american headline seen since one guy winning lottery afford get medical help. makes think conspiracy? California isn‚Äôt misrepresenting data Trump is. 

I love good news, it‚Äôs based factual, transparent data. Downplaying cases deaths good news it‚Äôs true virus still around. 

We heard tapes Trump talking downplayed severity virus. Trump talked numbers rerouted CDC White House city state .gov sites says testing underreported. verify looking data, July 15th data dips. Don‚Äôt take word it. encourage critically think take look. 

[Trump Administration Orders Hospitals Bypass CDC Data luckily media already ran away headline firmly implanted false information people's heads. liked [this interesting take herd immunity idea even without full herd immunity, spread slow likely spread become infected. virus work harder, speak, keep spreading. Seemed plausible me, least. Huge percent wearing masks... indoor dining yet... schools still closed... gyms still closed... bars still closed... almost everyplace put COVID protections... I'm even human. Care what? People falling stairs? awful year.

I remember early ""only"" thousand deaths, wife shaken hear 100-200k Americans could die. Looks like wishful thinking. far enough removed donald trump allowed happy? Actually isn‚Äôt outbreak literally 2 people getting infected think current anti-lockdown protests bad? seen nothing yet comes true. Never heard thebritishjournal. unbiased they, anyone know? Good Totally agree. Look 200,000 dead imagine one person closest you.

Imagine (and their) suffering, pain, hurt, loss grief.

Now multiply 200,000 scientific consensus. I'm virologist/epidemiologist, know topics extremely complicated. much like fields knowledge, people argue truths years really know.

Edit: people COULD argue
Not argue. could reach consensus then. Ayn Rand replaced Mister Rogers buffets still open I've working ass 3 years living going community college, paying bills, etc. Working 60-70 hours week summer 3 jobs. could save enough money college. job required meet people face face throughout pandemic. I've contact thousands people since cv19 (delivering pizzas, also pub contact many inside). top head believe I've least 10 party's since February, also went blm protest, basically excuse get house socialize people included. 

Anyway, seems silly I've through. socializing human beings illegal though, lock up. something impactful, reorganise society impactful? Winter coming Yeah, when's 100% sometimes people go feel. doc says keep sling week 2 days later like, I'm good, that's 100%.  7-day moving death average increasing again. well five links 2 literally peer reviewed 3 preprints, finished going peer review yet.

Clearly reliable media articles referring anecdotal cases lung heart damage sub takes gospel. said we‚Äôd tired winning. Teach man COVID make fire, smell smoke. Set man COVID fire, worry COVID ever again.  
 
or something like that. That's administration likes hear. important America changes diet, surely? Seriously dude I‚Äôm sooooooo fucking mad Halloween gonna cancelled

Just gotta get weird guess many die? Lockdown round 2 come! live country discourages things. FDA chance approving lol unless China setup manufactory vaccine US. Even that, trump probably gonna cripple company manufacturing vaccine forcing US pharmaceutical buy manufactory sells vaccine exorbitant price.

Edit: educated guess. Yay! win! guys suck, wait... Sorry hear dealing this. Best luck partner.

So assumption true based actual real life experience, based reading articles using preconceived ideas based actual real life experience. 6%! happens Orwell dystopia. Easter 2023 likely. Longer Trump president.  Woot WOOT. numbah 1. Suck Italy. Suck Brazil. Suck Gina. ...Because really end day.

Yes people losing income 2+ months end world right eventually  Better yet, blame federal government. They‚Äôre one done nothing actively criticized governors every step way five thousand discrepancy explained fresher data thousand Americans dying day. data 5 days fresher everyone else‚Äôs. We're number 1 üò≠ Turns saudis planned 9/11. Turns none terrorists came via Canada. Turns Mexico isn‚Äôt paying wall. Turns WMDs Iraq. Turns Americans constantly misled lot things. Arent also counting died underlying health issues COVID-19 deaths? ""you can't that"" Blood outside body. story behind information mean. 

‚Äú200,000 real deaths,‚Äù ‚Äúonly 6% real.‚Äù 

Trump said ‚Äúx, he‚Äôs monster‚Äù ‚Äúoh joking/it taken context.‚Äù

The west coast fire. ‚Äúglobal warming issue,‚Äù ‚Äúthe liberals mismanage everything?‚Äù 

There‚Äôs two explanations literally everything, instead looking facts people choose one sounds better them. think O-negative 100% sure. America's penis always prevails Thats alot lawsuits reroute china! Ahhh. see you‚Äôre going semi plausible denial. Nice work. Maybe look cute puppy photos shit. Actually commenting engaging strangers complete waste time personally know people work higher education diabetes and/or high blood pressure. people *are* elevated risk even though they're nursing home.

And thinking risk assessments, keep mind there's lot ground ""mild/no symptoms"" ""dead"".... USA! USA! USA! USA!  Like jails. exemptions. rules everyone. Easy follow, easy punish. irony entire comment truly astounding. Rick Scott got away massive Medicare fraud, also got governor senator. commit fraud ""right people"".

Killed coconut = COVID death.

None us know real data is. Like fucking clockwork.


I hate people. could've beaten half country antiscience death cult. Yeah apparently COVID 19 like flu. Better kill everybody‚Äôs dream George must running low cash point Whats really sad virus become political millions people really even give thought deaths. tragic deaths happen. many casually dismiss it. 

I would hate shoes someone lost loved one cause death dismissed easily, even called hoax. Hahaha former lineman, I‚Äôve done way I‚Äôd like admit. Source Ive seen list times around different people posting it.

Two sources almost word word identical, one preprint may preprint August. May September pretty long time stay preprint.

that best one source. people pushing seem deep understanding science either.

I mean science.

With authors different order, make two separate sources.

it's clear group sources getting passed around. probably disappear 6 weeks Biden's inauguration they'll still say ""see hoax along."" Movie marathon, make scary movie together costumes have, make scary scavenger hunt, mini DND campaign, play Clue, carve pumpkins watch movies, listen/tell scary stories, eat feast apples, carrots, grapes, cheese crackers, warm cold apple cider, bake pumpkin pie, pumpkin cream cheese rolls, pumpkin cheesecake, apple pie, caramel candy apples, pumpkin honey bars. Keep pumpkins lit night, leave candy Sam, always check candy. Cool. Sounds like good workout.  family talking one got COVID died. response essentially ""if get it, we've made choice we'll deal together"".

Yeah personally know people know serious always been, they're tired sitting inside would rather choose returning normalcy even literally means playing russian roulette lives many days NZ goes without new case today's equivalent ""# days since last accident"". people illegally cross anyway? border west mountainous remote. Perhaps east, like saw Quebec Trump got elected. Medicaid fraud undoubtedly become scrutinized situation ever business.    Imagine trying push blame Democrats trying investigate President crimes.

You embarrassed party threw law, order, judicial process allowing witnesses speak.

Always remember this: Anyone said Trump guilty willing testify oath. Anyone said innocent willing testify oath. want cause panic /S like changed 415,000! USA! USA!! Oh wait.. I'm trying downplay coronavirus, nowhere near devastating Spanish flu. 100M people US 1918. There's three times now. Covid likely hit 1.8M. Uuhhhhh, no. Chinese lab. no, all. silly comparison. need maths lesson. Hence travel bans pandemics need sweeping travel bans.  Correct. referring idea ""no lockdown, changes, everything normal"" ppl Sweden.

Well, no. Restaurants must pass health inspections, buildings must built code, people legally wear seatbelts, cannot light neighbors house fire. People dumb dumb things, charge create law order prevent this. countries, strict lockdowns followed legal mask mandates. idiots countries fined arrested. Instead mandating masks (or measures) charge knowingly allowed hundreds thousands die. crime. absence another wave

We can't ""another wave"" end year unless current one ebbs, won't. We're still first wave, continue first wave while. wish people would care way 200,000 people die heart disease America think might stat. 1918 flu 600k Americans died 20-50 million died worldwide. Woot woot Now? ""More people died World War 2""?  all-caps gives away weak-ass troll game last one yelling screen.

Oh God, we're fucked... Damn, 200k? expected higher number. told boss couple people office April ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt back office thing cools down. def control august‚Äù 

They looked like crazy person alarmist. course. January February fear lot damage undoable though.

Others get keep collectibles. go visit Facebook idiots saying actual number 12,000 number lies make sure Trump isn‚Äôt re-elected. 

I personally know 4 people died 3 different states. possibly population 12,000 deaths? don‚Äôt know many people. 
I kn [Conspiracy theory born poor reading USA! üá∫üá∏ #1 swine flu killed husband 41. version flu remarkably horrible way go dying loved one watching. Fuck everyone take seriously. upset someone making easy correct claim US fucking up? Wow waste comment. H1N1 killed 12,500 people one year time. pandemic response team national plan worked. COVID-19 killed 200,000 people much less one year dismantled pandemic response team national plan.

Sounds like don‚Äôt care human life worshiping cult leader, matter many people cult leader kills.

Trump infamously prevented supplies getting certain states, btw. Trump new virus lied American people. indeed Trump Virus. Unofficially? combined battle dead Civil War‚Ä¶ seem matter anymore. know shit could keep rolling along hit 250,000 more. 

We're numb. become new normal.  Sigh...I wish family mostly made *those* people global pandemic. Sounds like guys understand want thrive survive. legit mean say good parenting.

Well people interested getting tested ya do? prefer electrical tape....the wd-40 breaks adhesive.....gives nice armadillo shell type flex. worry.

I‚Äôm scared (19M) really don‚Äôt want lose Sorry, thought dumb thing act oblivious about.

But right, Trump's antics focus sub. still make argument Swedish population changed behavior halted spread infections there

Looks like Uppsala University used ICL model argue lockdown. Even social distancing, prediction 50,000 (low end) 70,000 deaths.

Closing schools, businesses, household isolation Mandatory social distancing 28,000 46,000 deaths.

You can't claim Sweden things.

At point one conclude model is, layman terms, got hit car last year spent 2 hours ER. 10 grand bills smattering companies. post lot political propaganda. sources back up?  ""Is is."" -Donnie  scary part apparently spread well heat cools likely going get much worse summer been. hey honestly believe 6% total number reported. CDC said. president reddit?  someone explain numbers differ CDC numbers? do, covid patients cost money require extra precautions. actually ""make"" more.

However, falsifying death records something vast majority hospitals do, there's extensive electronic paper trail, getting caught would very, expensive. Interesting perspective, thanks writing miserable attempt troll, dude. equally shitty Wait, whole world hoax!!???
Trump2020??

Please wake fuck people.

A half eaten pop tart would better job trump, would cost less money ?, 

And 200,000 Americans could still enjoying gift life.

He letting us die people!!!! Wake up! Trump admin, it‚Äôs still success.

They base success based initial statistic that, US done nothing, would 2 million+ deaths. 

This bragging point. long less 2 million, claim victory. reddit Forcing people homes viable answer, forcing sanitary measures public places (like every first world country did) viable solution prevented countries became massive graveyards.

The fuckers voluntarily riled people minimize virus impact divide country. Basically treason people. US. ""It is."" understand. Completely.

Or don‚Äôt accept that, 7% actually corona deaths!! /s even know positivity rate is?

Vietnam 1,063 confirmed cases √∑ 1,009,145 tests = 0.1%

I read right mainly young catching would ofcourse indicate much lower death rate well. Could they've managed better protect elderly catching it. 

Things could always change mean Spain rising cases since mid July far marginal increase deaths. far....

Mark words...by end round two gonna push aroun 500k....

Fucking morons... Correct. idea Governor need implement ""emergency powers"" brief period, legislature passes actual law deal longer-term crisis.

The problem Pennsylvania legislature run Pachyderms thus refuses acknowledge crisis exists. even remotely close numbers didn‚Äôt type lockdown.

This Trump virus. Trump downplayed this, intentionally lied people, downplayed wearing masks, let spread first happening ‚Äúliberal‚Äù states, didn‚Äôt care Americans.

Trump murderer, plain simple. Ok. So. make sure I'm reading right. implying reason think statement silly actually true want admit it? 

Just we're page here.  people wonder rich care things. know called fines pathetic part ordinary business expenses.

I sure making point intend unless compassion human life.

I hand would joyed saved 30,000-50,000 lives. big they? Easy, claim deaths blamed covid. getting pretty hard argue stupid. SO's grandfather passed away (non-COVID) family decided funeral close family.... 20 them. felt like jerk going, even bigger jerk salty funeral all, convinced least stay full week parents isolate. Whole situation sucks, winners. That's true. meant along lines started, would argue them. can't put BS. boss told us last week 10k, they‚Äôre listing COVID cause death everybody dies hospitals make money. Oh lucky me. two things rely make life.

Now people start hoarding make famotidine shortage even worse. :( really see anyone murdering someone they're potential disease vector... guy Joe Rogan said could happen way back began? Forgot name, wrote book Sars predicted this. said 200k Remindme! 1 year much 'conflicting' straight purposeful misinformation campaign conservative media.   idea US works?

Your ""bad news"" also accurate, major problem. Rhemdesiver easy manufacture suprise shortages coming months. Plus, multiple instances shortages oxygen tanks big spikes around world. Keeping death rate low entirely dependent keeping overall case numbers low. Nah, trigger distraction division cult think made mistakes. main strategies seem stroking troops, racism, sexism, economy. forget one due week. assume protocol ""don't use hydroxyquinine."" beginning overwhelmed rapidly shifting projections, wrote worst case number 828,000. Must false like We'll pass UK within week two Spain probably weeks now. countries atleast got deaths control eventually US never did. went shot right again.  Fresher data, probably.  sick winning! please go back rest life never anything? much winning! Best numbers! üéº‚ÄúI‚Äôve paid dues...‚Äù antibody tests useful large population surveys, diagnosis certain children initial diagnostic testing fails, according expert panel.

again, like read links use. guy talking using population surveys, article talks limitations usage testing generally used population surveys, diagnosing illness individuals, panel said. guidelines described two situations antibody testing could used normal diagnostic tests virus ‚Äî called PCR tests ‚Äî failed likely fail. pay Yup. Everyone stayed home, socially distanced wore masks. could. Nothing else expected. fuck it. tested rodents. long way go approved human usage. that‚Äôs business exactly? Piss  signed rare disorder? look forward presenting research sometime thread lol However, Corona claim many lives simply claim.

That I‚Äôm disputing, prevention improved treatment lower deaths even without also answer people stop involved die car accidents? 

Deaths car accidents (Deaths per vehicle mile) dropped factor 10 last 90 years possibly sit cure cancer moment?

Prevention cancer treatments significantly lowered cancer deaths point herd immunity might achieved much lower threshold previously thought--IMO likely due preexisting immunity. probably reach herd immunity, acceptable cost.

I'm saying whether pursuing infection-conferred herd immunity public health policy better worse alternatives. I'm pointing might much less costly previously thought. 

The implications profound course. places might already achieved HIT, others might really close without even knowing it.

And know people 50 rarely die COVID, could easily imagine herd immunity could achieved minimal loss life, long people older 50 well vulnerable people protected.

Lots consider HIT low. police disbanded? like Given current feckless national leadership, progression infection reckless young older relatives, think 150k safe bet year end. Another 150k 2021 effective public health measures get control. teaching covid 19 6th grade students (how spreads, prevent, fact checking fake news rumours). 2 months asked make text, drawing, video, etc, covid19 one said going video soccer exercise kills corona virus friend told this...

Unfortunately not. Treating mice mean shit treating people neat way get grant money scientist. Advancements mice medicine almost never translates humans.

There growing awareness limitations animal research inability make reliable predictions human clinical trials [8]. Indeed, animal studies seem overestimate 30% likelihood treatment effective negative results often unpublished [9]. Similarly, little third highly cited animal research tested later human trials [10]. one-third enter clinical trials, little 8% drugs pass Phase successfully. power here.  Cases falling significantly. deaths start fall weeks.  That, way, worst case number Trump gave months ago. Antibody tests nearly accurate  preprint press think meant combative 100% arguments insults meant pull away original point, body takes time heal even believe better virus, like flu covid. one ever saying know recover flu longer may think, also means believe coronavirus.

Antibody tests tell much population Covid, much accurately. least true May. time, nowhere higher rate NYC, 20% people tested positive (though huge portion wealthy left city, probably overestimate).

Different sense allow mice/hamster immune response work expected, eliminates virus molecular level. publication also mentioned it‚Äôs incapable binding human cellular structures thus, side affects. isn‚Äôt like rest. University Pittsburg right track, they‚Äôre telling truth.

Also, find lack faith disturbing. However, Corona claim many lives simply claim.

That simply true, wasn‚Äôt true AIDS, car accident deaths, cancer deaths. Improved prevention treatment lowered deaths Thanks encouragement, pal conduct research understand quoted new story primary literature.

I double major biology microbiology literally published microbiologist(not first author), want learn late flagellar synthesis H pylori mannose family pts operon salmonella, research would germane.

The salmonella work published.

This means length lockdown number deaths going positive correlation.

Mao great influence, inspired change better. literal piece idol worship CCP members. fact face remains Tiananmen speaks alot. China really fallen grace since cultural revolution. time upper limit seemed absurd... high enough based behaviour. Using models countries actually enacting measures simply multiplying models US population put probable deaths year much higher. remember math estimate using models 750k- 1million. thought high, realize limited measures put place put place, it'd probably accurate.

That said watched estimates seeing Canada Germanys seemed using accurate models. numbers way low year out.

Near time projections, one province Canada said complete inaction could lead projected 100k deaths province alone. far smaller US. numbers seemed absurd comparison. Ok, super rich, ordinary people segragated based bs. underprivliged every way life, see would get equal medical treatment crisis. Simply add up. called pandemic hoax? Nothing enjoyable happening.

Honestly, give fck. Every human ability thinking opinion. Unless China lol

Look, simply care, bother explaining. bullet points find Wiki.
 
1. previous ""corona"" like outbreak SARS; time things even think stupid contain it.

2. pre-event, distrusted towards China things like this.

3. this, fully equipped first three months outbreak. friend 'Murica  seen fianc√©e since March got separated due covid19. US I'm EU. end spring next year, care many ppl gotta kill go see her. cant both? I'll look that. I'm interested basing on. Sorry inconvenienced wear mask prevent mass homicide millions people.

I could cite sources I'm going homework you. Example post comment please. flu... /s

There memorial erected sad state things: never forget anti-logic crowds do... Sounds like Corona. Hes Asian. trust him. bit bad intelligence?

Sadam supported bin Laden - ERM like lot history showing like all.

Ok, WMDs use America.- come way even close kind thing.

But chemical weapons use US Israeli troops - turns fake intelligence nothing found.

That's hid Syria - 0 evidence that.

Ok bad guy help people - far worse dictators US actively supports many cases aided getting power. 

Oops sorry bad intelligence. Give fucking break. great hear, somehow seem first one even talk would treatment son super rich Indian, silly me. win? Advertise. PSAs. Make free. Ask people get test location known someone positive &amp; infectious was. think keep know less people die exclusively flu? die contributing factors like pneumonia.

Did know *nobody* dies exclusively HIV? die major contributing factors.

Stop downplaying virus. That's subsidies for. people going lose income regardless tight loose lockdown is. 

Keeping strict minimises length time necessary minimises chance needing another one - least go full elimination. say disappear elections democrats elected. None? Man, getting ripped scenery awesome times, yeah. remember views Pennsylvania memorable ones. Seeing city like New York Cleveland's skyline driving also really cool.  That's top already known deaths? New Zealand worse, free local transmission. Try keep up.

They recent outbreak, put good measures covid free again. China outbreaks, put control measures covid free again. point comparison. I'm sorry awards post depressing  50% fat people... 50% Genuinely curious trade deal. Got link keyword look up? We're people angry bad deal, China? Guarantee it‚Äôs Dems fault listening wonderful leadership. best leadership. wash up, save money. Good doesn‚Äôt help stated fact president. College isnt high point, milestone.

Jesus can't true enough.

All life I've told;

* kid best time life!
* high school best time life!
* college best time life!

I /r/raisedbynarcissists/ household whole life, childhood greatest. High school filled snobs thought better everyone else plus parents stressing fuck entire time cause ""you need 4.0 GPA go college"".

I nipped college shit bud junior year HS. started working part time instead live parents early 20's, moved last year, great paying stable job benefits, one bothers me, plus zero student loans. girlfriend highschool went college scholarships grants, plus pitched job help pay anything else, graduated debt free BS got married.

Literally right now, post college/highscool/kid ages, happiest least stressed life I've ever been. America f****** response President Trump downplayed virus.

The United States advanced Nation largest economy, best healthcare, innovative pharmaceutical companies, yet highest deaths infections, work?  % passed along potenitally killed mom/dad/high-risk/grandparent? much *certain*?

Call alarmist - used that... there's still enough data around 9 monthish-old virus, folks.


Just rare child die it:
  a) mean can't catch it
  b) pass along increase community spread familiar it, still stand said. purpose figurative language exaggerative. meant pull assist readers grasping concept point might otherwise complex convoluted uninteresting own. choice exaggerative grounded decided based importance seriousness information expanded on.

Having million things do, another way say got alot do. mundane important day day experience hyperbole fine. heavily used understood. 

In context talking about, someone wants use figurative language discuss pandemic, best leave hyperbole it. Similar concept, yes. F. Bill Gates Sr rags riches story though. Rags riches basically two step process. Agreed.

Reddit moderators double duty Chinese propaganda. need take red cap off.  clear love crush orange boy, can't quit obsessing him. widowed 5 years, I‚Äôm early 40s. traumatic therapy experience. Fuck dating sites, I‚Äôm done life. yet still knuckleheads say things like ""this nearly bad people thought going be."" Funny considering people, even many sub, thought virus never going reach US all. US head state declaring sort victory 6 cases whatever. 6.6 MILLION cases. nearly bad initially thought? country literally fire unprecedented 200K dead US civilians. Hello. 121 deaths 6,700,000 cases....that's 0.002%.

And young people day still panic think they'll die catch COVID? REALLY?

EDIT: ""The researchers added 75% 121 people died least one underlying medical condition, frequently reported conditions chronic lung disease asthma, obesity, neurologic conditions cardiovascular conditions.""

So....ONLY 30 deaths 6,700,000 cases healthy people? That's 0.0005%!!!! Also AP busy writing opinion pieces like ""Why Democracies better handling outbreaks"" lmao.

EDIT: mistake atlantic: strong reasons. Literally measures battered economic activity, since bounced back despite second wave infections biggest city, prompted analysts temper gloomy forecasts  Gods dammed, sounds like actually tweet Ironically, people, like yourself, felt way, fewer people would feel way. Still improvement sad shit replied to.  Probably better trash post. Proof improper research conclusions would better dismissing research based funder.

IF case lot good research would throw out. Ok fascist.  Proof?

Guilt association fly. Doubtful researchers cared Bannon was. I'd love know COVID deniers say this, since sure chance catching virus wedding statistically unlikely nothing worry about. amazing (and depressing) watch idiots know nothing math epidemiology act like experts internet. hoax gone way long! perpetrators ashamed Science facts! 1620? I'll watch Fox news sure... Curious, lies think people caught in? I'm saying ignore it. comparing apples oranges. plenty people plenty. saying untrue generalizing.  LETS GO 1 MILLION LOSERS  Na Wooo congrats, oh wait. No, cuz words fool.  scares people legitimately believe data reported CDC saying 6% deaths covid related deaths, take there's **only** ~12,000 deaths covid 94% fake numbers hospitals report ""extra pocket money""

The 94% people pre existing medical condition. Obesity, diabetes, etc counted 94% too, along covid, mean they're fake numbers.  admit I'm following closely, chances look pretty decent. I'm qualified make actual prediction win, looks like could go either way. far know, empirically speaking, following things true:

* Biden's national polling lead Trump currently larger Clinton's time 2016

* Biden's lead important battleground states nowhere near large national lead, well within margin error. think still slightly larger Clinton's was, certain that.

* Trump gradually closing polling gap time. Biden's lead larger July today.

In light that, opinion could go either way. would quite surprised landslide either direction. 2 million going final tally, country alone. Assume worst case scenario underreported magnitude 10. 200k considered worst, actual doctors specialize field. Quite opposite actually.

If priority important thing democrats focused time?

They intelligence information... USA #1 BABY Ah no. hate everyone equally. Fs chat Easy, restrict access in-person employment, nonessential activities, etc. without testing. 

Womp womp dream! Know this, dear leader walked White House handcuffs American people turn attention traitors complicit deaths better pray show compassion human decency deplorables shown others. Ok unrolled eyes. LoL

I've people snark adding /s adding /s, etc. etc. assumed worse. Intermediate-term lung damage permanent damage. That's called intermediate-term damage permanent damage. 

Did COVID kill reading comprehension skills? Imagine trying say trump made covid priority February democrats screaming bloody murder impeachment.

Imagine supporting President handle one thing time. Fingers crossed another 200,000!  able say publicly?

Why would able say that? issue brought every Danish debate. I‚Äôve never heard anyone argue it‚Äôs good idea get tested because. I‚Äôve also never seen data showing significant problem responsible authorities doesn‚Äôt seem believe it‚Äôs actual issue. Apparently average Swedish Redditor better informed. 


‚Äú... certain group critics enough room media...‚Äú

I think illustrated point there. One big difference DK SE DK it‚Äôs controversial disagree critical towards authorities.


Edit add: I‚Äôve definitely seen anyone Denmark argue test people symptoms like Sweden. Everybody seem convinced it‚Äôs good idea test close contacts known cases. school child teacher includes lot people symptoms. call Spanish Flu Spain reported cases. US may origin first confirmed cases Kansas. actually good know, thank you. I'll try use solely one data source, afaik coronachart.me reputable, feel like confirm that.

Yes exactly though, regardless exact figures, India middle becoming ground zero worst pandemic.

America infrastructure, although numbers scary, least spread out. much pisses we've fumbled badly, able rely solid enough system ensure become absolute catastrophe.

I hope best country. end day, human beings. effects us all. Still Beating obesity deaths That's easier destroy create Congratulations America number 1 Trump! biggest number entire world! many thousands?

Because less 500 every age 24 USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA USA... WE'RE NUMBER 1, WE'RE NUMBER 1! put another way, deaths Vietnam, Korean, Iraq Afghanistan wars *combined*. 

It's fast approaching,it already surpassed combat deaths Civil War. (215k)

And may well beat WW2 (290k) end year. 

I wonder we'll commemorations passed.. history judge time well. Well friend who‚Äôs friend five times. get lot comment, think comparison Trump valid. number crunchers showed Trump actually loss value wealth compared relative performance markets time (ie. would e made money dumping index fund.) sad makes crazy liberal.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Covid-immune nation hail from? That's true, Sweden. ""Seems absurd lock whole country handful cases.""

I guess good lockdown whole country then. Auckland went lockdown, of. tell parents this... like term! use others easily! LoL different placebos used different trials, choose placebo fairly similar side effect profile. people could know obviously group in, would poison data. How'd flatten curve then? Lmfao get like 20 minutes week I‚Äôve seen thousand times pay attention ‚ÄúThey( fallen trees) become really like matchstick... explode.‚Äù Oh sure, Biden wins right going cause shitshow like Dems last four years. right, going mess either way.  They're talking shitty ""covax"" program I'm glad America part of. Plus get flu COVID time. Yes, PA, NJ, well DE, judicial district. would also make Murphy's rules, Delaware's rules unconstitutional. ...contradicting nothing said.

I can't even tell parody not, since people supposed content nourish crumbs governments hands? think it‚Äôs easy sit Reddit pretending like could predict anything happened let alone century event CDC prepared actually jobs. Comparing lighting neighbors house fire ultimate drama move. There‚Äôs lot blame go around, wish people would start stop acting like need politician tell eat, piss sleep. We're number one! We're number one! We're number... oh. NY getting ‚Äúas many new cases handle?‚Äù Congrats, everyone! Plus, flu seldom leaves long term health issues got rid it. People are, understandably, focused deaths, Covid leave sorts problems Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome line covid infections anyone? better 2021. Mostly tracing isolation policy. help prevent people developing diabetes obesity definitely good thing.  Thats required, need make sure let virus in.

E.g, mandatory 2 week quarantine arrival arrivals. get escorted airport hotel locked inside 2 weeks. 

If people like visit country.  First time I've heard it. Relax 500k baby, come!!  Fair enough, he's still done tried harder cared many states  45% asymptomatic. case Vietanam, little testing person symptoms. certainly remember thinking setting bar super low said 100k dead would success, 100k-200k possible range. 

But assuming competent leadership. reasoning absurd. someone cancer gets hit car dies, still die hit car, cancer. Go back r/wallstreetbets miss everyone watching Tiger King wait, hospitals really get less funding depending people dying of? isn‚Äôt hundreds thousands dead people good enough reason fund hospitals? fucks believe think voting works way False equivalency Compared what, men?  title kind ambiguous. curve logarithmic increase back then, based you‚Äôd assume infinite deaths.

If makes feel better prediction 2 million seems small. -DeathSantis would peaceful, US defund military police like 90% put money helping everyone. Otherwise, yea, ain't going peaceful years. context governors Mr. ain't got time watermelon bullshit. Less competition.  Hate break you, regardless who's charge, people keep dying. certain thing life. phrasing can‚Äôt back up. Remove it. consequences hysteria many CT values near detection limit PCR coupled persons disease mild symptoms. important thing don‚Äôt see correlation number infections hospitalizations spring. Covid-19 never idiot confidence Quebec crossing mind. idea that. end wall ridiculous either border anyway. take death tolls America's 3 bloodiest wars COVID killing us faster them. Combined.

I think illness guns bombs people get fucking deadly is.

[Does take fucking **vote**, people. knowing flu rona gonna real fun times  US bully playground nukes telling everyone else he's actually bully, he's uhhhhh freedom fighter. It‚Äôs better place live Mexico. Way safer yeah, probably continue trend things get worse many different fronts. Irrationally leaning towards fact blank slate truth that's not. Actual deaths, people died different reason found positive fact? Ruh roh! Remember 240000-2.4 million prediction? way 60k prediction put Fauci et al Dallas. testing sites seem pretty empty ****USA! USA! USA!**** Oh wait isn‚Äôt good thing winning at.... usa! usa! usa!  Yeah, model wrong. clearly bad misstep. difference misstep amongst track record genuinely trying caring. polar opposite Trump done, care lie put politics beloved stock market American lives. Context matter  read, 7% deaths directly related covid-19. I'm making excuse anything maybe specifying. case following trend 857k deaths.:(  celebrating? Oh, it‚Äôs deaths Covid, Covid. also count heart attacks kidney failure shock, exacerbated necessarily caused COVID.

That's distinction without difference. people HIV deniers AIDS. AIDS technically kill anybody. whatever mundane infection get.

The numbers evident excess mortality rates.

But course already know that. fuck bullshit, cunt. current restrictions melbournians free travel within area size 22 football pitches approximate girth mother. He‚Äôll say we‚Äôre wrong. Need bigger flashlight think though like live country like Cuba aspire doctor know could possibly part deal set become healthcare worker still bet going person claiming real numbers 10% official count. Getting pretty tired debunking independent YouTube researchers. meme back arguing seems futile effort. much do, except maybe taking counter Vitamin supplements right away (many research articles talk correlation better covid health outcomes among people Vit. deficient -- takes weeks increase Vit.D levels). symptomatic people responsibility go work sick point. could get tested talk doctor he's positive. Good luck! absolutely slam herd immunity then...hopefully HELP vaccine Yes, back hygiene difficult definitely difficulties getting people ""quarantine"" wear masks. stands reason death toll high. 

We learned experiences. Obviously didn't.  Yes, that‚Äôs going happen. studies showing it‚Äôs far outweighed COVID deaths AREN‚ÄôT counted so. people believe false positives apply entire number. see bad get, need look Peru, 1.5x deaths per capita compared USA *and* account around 1/3 excess deaths. Basically, that's equivalent almost 1M deaths USA. Right brother. Can't wait til reddit melts re-election. Even people believe problem give shit selfish see world beyond needs desires.

I friend Melbourne decided lockdown apply went beyond limit meet tinder date. 

And apparently I'm bad guy calling selfish cunt. Guns murder people too, yet somehow getting blamed much doctors. recommend Brawndo crops? ::::rips phat line cocaine::::: Coronavirus may last long, don‚Äôt think people willing live lockdown long. traveled across America? pretty spread ourselves. CDC updates slowly. Worldometers picks data state reporting. JHU excludes probables, flip days. morality rate now. 1% yet Wrong. hurricane season push COVID particles Atlantic. Wait you‚Äôll see -summer- ... Everyone cares global focus 7 months.

Realistically though, even close major player comes overall mortality rates. people actually claiming deaths come estimates. Nearly 3000 people died 9/11, new number covid comes nearly 67 times that.

For fucks sake, people need wake up.  Use eyeballs dum dum! mean, look it. clearly manmade. greedy, weak, uncaring nature Republican ""anything-for-profit"" mindset explains hell lot awful mess us in. Trump perfectly capable demonstrated curfews. Biden harder time, may willing. able believe shit happens makes necessary man made. Yep, easily 300k real terms, more. according parents numbers fake pumped evil democrats Remember 50 cases? Good times Again, say Easter... Well wait ‚Äúherd mentality‚Äù kick in. spoonerisms/malapropisms would funny except death toll. Center Disease Control Prevention That's economically possible. economy crash. think they‚Äôve passed ‚Äúofficially‚Äù passed Yes they've truthful, right start. reason lie you? kidding right? country wants lockdown billion people? think it'd extremely easy hide true statistic, less testing, asymptomatic carriers, people literally thinking/treating like flu, tested, goes on.
 

And I've reached assumption due blatant, outright lies CCP feeding world since Oct 1st 1949.  #winning  CONGRATS! People already listen, I've planning distancing masking foreseeable future. would really love cookout friends board game night worth risk. ok. one panicked. Wait, mean injecting light shoving bleach arse? Like East Asian. true isn‚Äôt. Almost information agrees. opposite. knows impact long term kids contract one dead many  asthma going kill me. get COVID I'm probably goner MAGAts chant, ""He underlying health issues.""  ""Can find way get body? Almost like cleansing.""  people push this, it‚Äôs weapon, people fight masks stop virus.

Crazy train. mean, death toll doesn‚Äôt really matter . Kind irrelevant it‚Äôs past. Focus future Idk 8th amendment. there's 2. Bunch 3's 4's thinking 9's 10's, armchair politicians wannabe psychiatrists arguing one another. Pictures fucking salads cats. That's social media is. 5.8% economy, 60% domestic. exports fine, economy isn‚Äôt hit hard fuck sakes I‚Äôm sorry dudes. Stay safe American friends listen science shithead. didn‚Äôt Fuck WHO. socially distancing locking two years. Let's wait family visits they're dead.
Oh... sounds like 75k around best guess? ... got better Yeah cuz 15 seconds typing two comments really took  source number (expected deaths vs actual deaths)? I‚Äôd like handy next time run ~~idiot~~ misinformed citizen.  Nah, heard going go away, like miracle. cry read number people die car crash per year too? Lol obese, smoking, diabetes, killed people. Healthy people extremely likely survive covid. yeah things people told whole lives could lead early death surprisingly led to, early death... Likely violation 8th amendment. good reasoning behind expansion- safety data looks good, went fringe higher risk groups. know lot people questioning it, that's pretty reasonable explanation.  think read article. saying debatable origins found Spain, still could brought China, since used strain studied, can't confirm it. scientists questioning claims want testing done, possible. writers obviously opinion based written, issue black white make it. fit narrative? wish killed young people more?  Strange people seemingly don‚Äôt care coronavirus people think healthcare shouldn‚Äôt free... Bio terrorism 2018 article NIH website. Stating NIH funding research wuhan institute virology. man made, literally trying create human variant order defeat order avoid SARS pandemic . Like lot vaccines. 

But likely ""that one asshole"" work always cuts corners beat rush hour skipped steps sterilizing themself leaving lab. boom fuckd world. Please comment understand biology, medicine death certificates work. worry guys cuz Conservative subs remember 9/11! everything fine!? RIGHT?!   america death cult. feel way alcoholics drink drive kill people? gotta ""live on"". mean really, expect go work bar? Yes please!

Somewhat related, Bret Weinstein mentioned felt unlikely natural based genetic ‚Äújumps‚Äùessentially Joe Rogan podcast months ago... hell link get achievement? timeline like worsened?? New high score! Much similar pandemic flus 1918 lol. 1957 1968 comparable Europeans kind white. gonna force people go get tested?  Yeah, yeah... Antifa states spontaneously combusted reason it! Petition rename American Virus seeing America, despite richest country world, fucking petri dish. knowing America handles every single crisis, school shootings, poverty, medical mafia, etc., I'm guessing 2025 every country America ended covid. fuck whataboutism look difference..it took india 156 days reach 50k deaths..

America crossed milestone 23 days.. 

just look striking contrast 2 countries.. one's global power 331 million people one's 3rd world developing country 1.3 billion people.. No, didn't. Apologies. talking downvoters China, Vietnam, New Zealand. examples success across whole spectrum countries. also medicine help, working vaccine, Covid going suddenly mutate killing people 30's within 24 hours catching disease, getting tired unfounded doom sayers exaggerated BS. Let guess - Chinese used virus weapon knew patriots freedom-lovers would resist wearing masks. want destabilize country, go patriots *first*.

I need tinfoil hat. don‚Äôt see failure. People won‚Äôt follow lockdowns year, 
 
Sorry, think that‚Äôs false premise onset.
 
Nobody asked follow lockdowns year point all. day one outright refusal acknowledge virus and/or comply public health guidelines. We‚Äôre far that; people refused comply cause spread, spread extended duration stay home orders places them.
 rapidly rising numbers European countries despite stringent controls show best delaying inevitable shit going sweep population entirely.
 
It doesn‚Äôt show all. 
 
This notion people ignore public health guidelines eight months later people ignored public health guidelines caused spread places previously stringent controls contained virus absurd. 
 
Starve Beast doesn‚Äôt work. economics, politics, global pandemics. suspect get point US everyone know someone virus (if didn‚Äôt it) know someone died it. 

Living Canada. know 1 person virus. That‚Äôs it. got ex husband dating front line worker (nurse). World health organization. World. He's talking world reddit users. newt? ""It is."" Toll understood time. know really 12,000 people. don‚Äôt understand that?

That number giving H1N1 isn‚Äôt remotely high peer reviewed study showed that. heat probably slow down. another month, we'll see quickly spreads conditions optimal it. Trumps dickhead point still dumb enough wear mask socially distance can't really blame him. Exactly, kind scientists Twitter know lying, I'm kind confused? really bullshit scientific papers easily debunked real scientists. hell people Twitter know?? left bad right. sad see. People like person throw bus, comfortable blame someone, especially already dislike first place. Trump react poorly? course. Regardless anything Trump could done, Reddit would viewed ineffective tyrannical. Everyone access CDC information. ridiculous disease anyway political dividing point. seeing Americans acting, left, right, hard imagine single topic immune political spin. Even fucking NFL politically charged moment. downvote gang lol. 

There really valid points paper. brother currently residency sent paper told making rounds amongst former class mates coworkers. 

If educated types doctors passing around must reason. opinion least reason large scale investigations. loss child, sad, still rare. sure trying say. poggers go. learned? read red dawn email chain see wrong are. south Asia. Dr. Fauci touted as(still probably) world's leading expert. said March 8 2020 "" reason walking around mask"". blowhard currently listening advice? would lockdown work ever? mean common sense wise, disease spreads person person lockdowns make people interact less. Even widely available, many people willing take it? also saw plenty highly upvoted comments criticizing use masks reddit changed tune. Spain schools tend start days, around mid September, saying. town full bars, they're one I'd find right now. understand initial comment could make seem I'm taking lightly. appreciate response. bother - arguing absolute idiot lost ability common sense. Covid affected mental health clearly. needs help. I‚Äôm blocking season-going hopefully enjoy low nyc numbers November, isolate go back rural parents winter space coziness general, maybe week two skiing, spring outdoor activities again, hopefully going next fall vaccine. Breaking month easier refusal vaccinate. say [""America‚Äôs Obesity Epidemic Threatens Effectiveness COVID ‚ÄúWill COVID vaccine next year tailored obese? way,‚Äù said Raz Shaikh, associate professor nutrition University North Carolina-Chapel ‚ÄúWill still work obese? prediction no.‚Äù

With 107 million people able vaccinated even wanted brings problems. People warning months going take long time distribute administer it. AstraZenaca said producing vaccine easy part, actually getting vials patients hard part. Well, good debate nonetheless. Cheers! make sense write at-home diagnostics couple bad experiences. Ignore millions people use at-home diagnostics multiple times daily get precise results within strict margin error. IT! GO BIG GO HOME! think miss point. Donald Trump's doing, people upheld policies pushes. enabled this.

Why try interpret everything bad faith? FYI vaccines don‚Äôt prevent getting infected. prime body get infected you‚Äôre able fight disease quickly, usually even notice infected. Vaccines don‚Äôt create barrier prevent infection way mask does. must brutally painful stupid Europe seemed OK Exactly this! 
Chinese know mask works since January! 21% number April early assessments, see newer data backing number. CDC data [up date implies 6.9% T-Cell claim make stretch best. authors say t-cells exposure coronaviruses/the cold may help people fight covid-19. say 50% people may mechanism fight this, conjecture.  SAY IMMUNITY.

Both studies heard immunity mention immunity current state social distancing practices. study erroneously claim states NYC heard immunity, state NYC near heard immunity levels, goes say: estimates suggest hardest-hit areas, NYC, close heterogeneity-modified herd immunity threshold following first wave epidemic. However, type immunity fragile wanes time pattern social interactions changes substantially.

Any potential heard immunity modeling current social practices. changes level ""heard immunity"" longer valid. We'd need reach new threshold.

Overall think mixing matching data disparate sources pick narrative. reaching conclusions papers trying make. 

Florida enacted covid precautions, Florida SIGNIFICANTLY lower population density. much easier distance folks. Saying place fewer deaths NYC fair comparison, got hit hard virus President still claiming big deal. know treat stem spread well now. pandemic would much prefer FL NYC, much easier distanced. Wasnt reasoning like ‚ÄúMasks yet proven work, untill know will, wont mandatory.‚Äù ? buy shares eyeglasses company? Can't fake life returning normal there, has. Wish could say same. 3 weeks probably bit optimistic. Canada things shut mid-march May, really started seeing active cases clearly drop. think much initial infection time shutdowns started really took long time see clear trend downwards numbers recorded. Appreciate reply! university tried make sister friends responsible people, decided irresponsible anyway, that‚Äôs fault university? gym requires masks times, even machines. everyone mask chance spread low. really that. Thank you! didn‚Äôt think wanted make sure! Pfizer‚Äôs mRNA trial. 

First injection: bit balloon head feeling 30 minutes. Pain injection site arm pain lasted 3 days. swelling redness. prevalent side effects fatigue, heaviest day 2 getting progressively better finally ending around day 4-5. low grade headache would go away, muscle pain bad. Minor viral flushing, bad. never ran fever. actually worked time. 

Second injection: balloon head feeling 30 minutes injection. arm felt like weight, heavy. hit like truck night following day. Definitely viral infection feeling including viral flushing, chills, headache, fatigue, loss appetite, muscles began ache. Day 2 worst it, lots muscle joint pain. Continuation feeling hot getting chills, fever. Low grade headache continued. day 3 muscle joint pain tolerable, fatigue started lifting appetite returned. day 4 felt pretty normal, pain gone, occasionally hot/cold feeling less severe. Fatigue still wholly manageable. day 5 back myself. 

I would say day half felt legitimately bad. hadn‚Äôt expected muscle joint pain wasn‚Äôt really prepared it, hurt. absolutely worst part. But, went away pretty fast honestly, feel small toll pay. ""That person diabetes everyone knows diabetes deadly covid dying diabetes"" live masks work? short, early say response good, still need lot data. Herd immunity essentially means 75 percent population ultimately catches virus, hopefully end there.

Edit: OP previously posted ""There real second wave manufactured one"" seems mired sort thinking. figures.  Imagine thinking MAGA cult needs help looking bad. Hilarious! Red caps laughing stock civilized world. obvious lie. doctors nurses need bad general public. disgrace. Contributed alot deaths. also foolishly shipped ppe manufacturing China anyway full pandemic Mode, supplies stopped coming in. stupidly seemed think would fine would still ship stuff normal underestimate power exponential growth.

Rt = 1.38 today. comparison highest Rt state USA 1.28 - Delaware. 

RIVM calculates 368 infected people per 100k. That's 0.368% already.

This bad, especially see coming control messures implemented yet. surgeon general needs step down. mandate bill teeth attached it?   I'm sure 100% trust CDC point. supposed point things like pandemic feels like largely sidelines crisis. guessing first people start getting vaccines late December January know work, ""in Q3"" means ""hopefully ""Q4"" starts, ""July"".  Selfish? stupid? Seems likely correlated education level. lot less educated people work essential service like delivery cannot self-isolate even lock-downs. Excuse me, know need add /s sarcastic post far reddit, either idiot covering ass living rock last millenia.  could incompetence know think measures morally right, effective stopping virus, unlike opening casinos bars mask mandates. 

IMO governments need decide serious virus actually is, based decision either lock like Australia **knowing damn well lockdowns consequences** lock all.

Based real world data, think locking like Australia justified. Also based fact I'm capable intuitive thinking, think non-essential businesses allowed open mask mandates. They're either essential closed pandemic severe, they're non-essential open pandemic severe. mean always tradeoff. ""budget"" spread society, zero acceptance. close areas society \*can\* spend budget important. example sports events without spectators, highschools remain open. I'd consider visits end life people quite high list things prioritize budget.

Dude. Get fuck outside call friend Right. close people. Unless maybe making multiple stops close together Trump sent PPE stocks China. know army germany special rules americans coming back italy allowed reasons quarantine 14 days. disagree. title states result clinical trial misleading way. Bet never breach 100k mark, hook crook. would make difficult whistleblowers go committee release findings.*

There specific process government/private sector whistleblowers release information, reason - would unwise unfair allow people make incendiary claims without vetting claims first. long diverse body varied interests vetting, likelihood censorship suppression low.

I agree letting conversation flow terms us muggles talking issues impact us Reddit. BIG difference *you* telling *me* think COVID accidentally released lab, someone claiming *national news* insider releasing ""research"" proves incredibly serious charges person entity. barrier releasing claims and/or information national audience much, much higher.  course help, question is, degree? effective they?

I mean, covid particles small enough, masks might much. stupid say masks might effective. 

What stupid, something trivial wearing mask, chance might super effective. 

They certainly worse. Worst case scenario, make much difference wore mask basically nothing. Big whoop. 

Best case scenario, pandemic goes *way* better, many lives saved, business able run longer, everything better.

The ""no masks"" people fucking stupid, unbelievable. Well said. sub would better place people thorough comment is. Asking every thread but, someone share % positivity cases are? Bin-fuckin-go. I‚Äôm glad folks get it. Peru currently worst total deaths per 100K entire world (except San Marino 34K people). Per capita 60% deaths USA. Make America Great Depression Again! surely lock second time right? guaranteed protect me

That's probably true: masks designed protect others virus really like going either direction, offer protection others.

Meanwhile, vaccine might work 60% patients, mask might offer (e.g.), 60% protection every patient, possibly coupled reduced viral load. 

Both valuable - vaccine, assuming works, protect even partying without mask - mask protects everyone. people need look beyond ""magic bullet"" think every protective measure making Covid roll die every time would otherwise transmitted someone new. 

Even roll two proceed next roll dice - eventually it'll roll one forced give up. Individually, measures might fail - way knowing one succeed, try all. depends. started widespread human trials. It‚Äôs 40 years still vaccine HIV. course, virus near same, people recover like flu. time, different flu, shouldn‚Äôt quick say even developed world vaccine widely available soon. all, seeing cases previous infected getting reinfected, means virus evolving rapidly. That's medical ending we've already entered social ending accept risk precautions move on. social ending usually happens medical ending. Pangolin, possibly, agree. think comes how‚Äôs portrayed savior media. since people polarized see right. remember Taiwan Germany reminding us yet effectiveness wearing mask March April, still get right. guess believes us citizens also underestimate value Marxism.  Didn‚Äôt say don‚Äôt rake forests well something like guess seen everyone wearing masks? parties outdoor events? aware CDC estimates 40% infections Covid 19 Asymptomatic carriers? Spain 12k
France 10k
Uk 4k

Germany &amp; italy 1.5k

By Spanish numbers italy 15k cases germany 20k.

Not happening everywhere. Going seems. Thanks honest. Lol there‚Äôs parking lots Manhattan! Maybe they‚Äôd big park something. Plain see leaders wanted make sure health care workers access masks, lied told us masks work. late undo damage caused. Agreed. vaccine rollout (for 6 months maybe?) time afterward (another 6 months) expect wear mask public work. everyone that, combination masks vaccines would really stamp virus. flying planes maybe I'd wear mask next 2-3 years, guess. We'll see, though. Sixty-five guest wedding infects least 175. Although probably lot asymptomatic cases, since many died. 

Not wedding memory like. I'm freaking want back class I'm learning single goddamn thing Zoom school despite paying price. ***want*** back campus class like normal, vast vast majority colleagues. Oh, also feel like I'm going able actually get job there's way really network anything like right **I'm able go class events person.** lowest estimates made mine 20k. definitely closer proportionally. anywhere third halfway 600k already fall starting. proper actions taken, 600k would easy hit. Yeah mean, somehow played way person died really obvious one gave them, possible, burden people?

I think many people, would even enough knew found probably got met granny feel rather shitty. 

You know, tell yourself, maybe get me, yeah maybe never know sure, would still feel shitty no? likely go swing states.

Yeah man hear you. one dies lung disease. lungs fail caused decay. winter spread effectively indoors outdoors north viruses typically like cold. got preview March tail end cold season


With winter comes cold flu season. People start touching faces often going cold weather start sniffles. Transmission body fluids increase surfaces. Add people get cold corona virus time even though show symptoms covid possibly become super spreaders cold virus promotes coughing.



The upside winter better prepared. People wearing masks, people working home, habits changed hopefully enough people limit spread. ok grossly overpaying house? Food insurance expensive taxes high. significant portion world proven extended lockdown social distance measures bring virus control. 

Like Europe? Frontline clinical guy here. makes one especially diabolical federal government indeed give small extra payment patient covid. Remember, government's way determining payment *by diagnosis.* quite reasonable pay bit extra patient covid care complicated. think hospital makes bank result. First, like gov't payments, amount given far less actual cost extra resources. punch gut is, hospitals active covid cases typically stop nonurgent services, result closed operating services, anything get put is, means hospital's income plummets start frantically cancelling staff. reality covid financially devastating hospitals.

Not gonna argue that, Swedish politics famously consensus-driven, definitely grain truth this. go *√•sikskorridor* quite stretch. word coined 2010s professor political science, gist time reffering to, vaccination polarization. also noteworthy main use around immigration policy migration crisis, lot talking heads cryptofascists felt listened to. worlds smallest violin played alongside that, least.

I really see 22 scientists ""broadly shamed ridiculed"", met lot criticism yes. that's fine it? read original debate article really anything ""international scientific consensus"". criticism lack PPE slow ramping testing, completely right criticised for. criticised modelling insane need hospital beds advocating lockdown, stage would done nothing good. criticised calling FHM *talantless*. happened FHMs modelling orders magnitude line reality scientific consensus. shaming began twitter, especially one authors started retweeting RT news hell hole Sweden is. problem seeing called out. 

I following news Swedish, Danish Norwegian daily since March. gut feeling yours, ""no established media"" looked debate? have, news April May. say enough time voice opinions simply tired non-debate. seems Danish way it, reinforced idea Sweden silencing debate. 

I would like know think would right approach? questions asked proposals made asked journalists daily press briefing day after, day going weeks.

The e-mails communicate herd immunity also felt like non-story me, although interesting read. ‚ÄúThe 22‚Äù completely right original estimate actual Covid-deaths April level Italy early April authorities completely wrong.

what? wrote first article April 14th, referencing deaths week before. really following mean got right. also back-tracked statement. probably good, looking Italys excess deaths compared Swedens. mean word like that, sure.

It‚Äôs caused major divide sides opinion simply think side full morons think meant COVID things like gang violence, traffic accidents WAY months... would normally see X amount deaths per year things like homicide traffic accidents numbers could taken equation months. 

So accurate number would like... 

Excess deaths - average # homicide/traffic deaths/workplace deaths/etc = actual COVID deaths

Not sure explained well enough? California stop freedumbs entering? world warcraft

No? Feel free provide die COVID system counted COVID death, even massive underlying issues.

Also, Senate ""acquit"", chose remove President, nearly thing. someone know dies, get motivated stay home too.

I'm happier are. farther grocery/beer store since February, keep this. inept enough get us situation completely screwing smart quarantine project, inept enough know one fast easy solution - lock everything Correct. vast majority deaths due least 2 comorbidity conditions caused directly COVID. scientists need show locking save economy

It's interesting place blame scientists, people refuse listen scientists/experts saying 6 months performed analysis/studies people refuse read. Lol     Yeah, i'm filthy liberal I'm okay country-wide mask mandates.

In article posted :) exactly. get headaches least week. years now. run get covid test every time get headache going waste lot tests make others NEED results wait line behind me. 

You common sense. think direct exposure symptoms-you need test. Doctors saying even give tests tell get test consider excess deaths, 250K, guy's still saying 50K people would died Covid season. reasonable enough. think NAIAD involved funding well. need outlaw gain function research. far dangerous minimal benefit compared disastrous potential costs. Swedens health organisation still recommends wear masks, even public transport. Man Dan shills rabid force reddit. Fauci says time know asymptomatic spread. Right mask Covid around maybe year most. don‚Äôt know long term effects. I‚Äôm saying need lock forever we‚Äôd well think Covid binary death recovery. It‚Äôs complex that. Consider Lyme disease, lead long term impacts. never shut travel China. let 50,000 people point coming Europe.

He did. ones coming US citizens quarantined. European ban came ventilator shortage never paid attention stockpile.

No wasn't. expectation shortage. Show widespread shortages still massive shortage PPE President never anything that.

More disinformation. Factories US altered crank PPE downplayed it, called hoax, encouraged people break orders isolate, encouraged spread virus, got tens thousands people dead.

No called hysteria around hoax. Dem. hoax, actually. politicized spread misinformation, debunked lies, wild conspiracy theories based science, takes absolutely responsibility anything still don‚Äôt national plan, heading deadly time season.

This drinking Kool Aid. people like Surgeon General coming telling people ""stop buying masks"" ""Masks ineffective"". much spread many dead that? Yes downplayed it... Everyone downplayed it... could seen ""waste comment"" blaming others actions, inactions, Trump. get it, get it, takes responsibility completely useless irrelevant.

Yes, putting blame actions people directly linked spread deaths logical way looking this. irrationally blaming things directly responsible for.

Even almighty Fauci said administration went mitigation early. also said administration taking science based approach listened to, implemented, recommendations. London UK disagree this. Pubs restaurants following current guidelines crowded. part everyone wearing masks. get 10,000 deaths day, like extreme estimates postulated, hardest hit areas (probably) go lockdown. see happening (and really hope I'm proven wrong!).

There places less risk-adverse leadership may roll back guidelines, like lower restaurant occupancy even close bars something. that's mostly northeast. That's tad paranoid. think multiple accounts used report accounts. mods see kinda stuff really easily. USA! USA! USA! No, China India list. assume lie tests numbers, think worse US. China bad, gone massively since, since took right measures.  


Still, country like US compared China India, says something already.... what‚Äôs deal ppl acting like Faucci brilliant also super brave standing trump telling truth?  Someone Reddit argued people afraid go doctors dying often normal causes. Like someone heart attack going go hospital covid?? I‚Äòve angry since March. happen US winter? Depends spreads long incubates likes fantasy football (American), American university sports Reddits. think it‚Äôs fair say he‚Äôs talking US. 

I don‚Äôt think comment downvoted hell... reinforce resentment people different perspective him.

But actually tired hearing argument. don‚Äôt like gaslit. Masks effective. But, masks last resort. course maintaining open air better entering closed environment people. 

And obviously, everything risk people need weigh risks clear-eyes. excess death method used calculate. Basically compare current year years. probably reduction flu deaths (less transmission) example. may increase deaths people medical complications avoid hospitals covid. people drank bleach died. general get good portrait direct indirect deaths related covid taking account people may survive covid.

If look that, enough information see USA failed protect citizens. Someone thread already linked statistics that. wife locked SINCE MARCH. Fuck assholes taking overly serious helping ending it. I'm pissed point. god damn American NOTHING. simple. realpolitik 101: possible. nothing subject, uninterested indulging you. guy wants authoritarian power ability hold us homes long? week, 6 weeks, 3 months? what?

Does mean everyone non essential? Ok define essential. 

He doesnt understand asking clear goal end lockdowns. listening ""expert""? Stupid move. forced close operate limited capacity months end?  spike shows clear insertion mutation compared closely related coronaviruses. think virology ""circle wagons"" thing going on. Honestly, way gain function research. equivalent giving children loaded guns minimal supervision. someone shot, defending livelihoods, heavily tied kind research. difficult get man understand something, salary depends upon understanding Sinclair right always does, appropriate language used left use imprecise ways DARVO muddy waters. Except doctors recommending tests without symptoms anymore least area-the test turn around backing needed expedite people really needed results. Oh Jesus, find credible one right win apology tour. topic though. reversing plans cancel season bc COVID go ahead matches population/population densities might. lol interest links studies influenza myocarditis? interesting bring complication asymptomatic COVID influenza much larger percentage asymptomatic cases. 

Given generally test flu cases, certainly identify asymptomatic flu cases, wondered 10% stat comes from. 

As stands reason given myocarditis mild self resolving would lot instances go undetected viruses.   steps taking leave? Yep. That's trust anymore say one thing change minds. rather use recommendations countries like Taiwan Dude, even mention life good, get downvoted. Like say ""I make enough money job buy house, car, insurance money left fun things,"" get downvoted. Either hate absolutely think nobody able take care themselves. honestly think people believe government taking care needs. allowed say problem finding job make enough money order live good life. really crazy. Like, life good. I've always worked make comfortable living. never government give extra money survive.

I'm saying bad thing government help people people seem think taking care horrible thing do. supposed able pay health insurance. Go ahead post problem paying health insurance able cover cost big deal you. get downvoted. say health insurance impossible get bankrupt next hospital bill comes in. allowed say life good. really understand this. like people live miserable lives hate people actually good. bad completely take care worry government covering bills? swear people fighting hard everyone completely dependent government. can't stand rely someone else live. want go completely take care myself. want charge going life. causing people wanting someone else take care them. really think bad completely support complain it. 

Things actually really good right now. annoying part life wear mask go out. something bad worry lol. absolutely allowed say things good you. also allowed talk things think may make things better tomorrow. allowed criticize things already happened. looking forward, live past. can't look forward things may get better. idea caused mindset people depressing. imagine living like them. also offer solutions anything. thing allowed sit around cry. think lucked weather started get really nice (for us) around time shit got real closed border. That's lucky part, sure seems like virus spread nearly easily outdoors, lot us kept going outside later.

As Trudeau, I'm fan guy, certainly mind taking test time really short them. Better deal like regular joe getting special (unnecessary) treatment crisis. think locked prison become responsible deaths hundreds thousands Americans.  Even Georgia, admittedly hot mess stupidity, hospitals stayed intact. areas saturate ICUs able add beds and/or transfer patients. 

We could prevented deaths potentially long-term effects virus locked down, course, terms keeping hospital system functioning, okay. hey! People could go bowling back May, interested pandemic bowling. Pretty sure troll account Actually said (along WHO, CDC, everyone else) back Feb/Mar. Research homemade masks particular virus way it‚Äôs primarily spread taught us lot since then. admitted wrong amended recommendation. 

Personally, allow humans wrong time time. Happens best us üòé us counties NY side Lake Champlain alao also join new province? So, citing random dubious article quoting context date stuff hope show China anything. done quite bit - broke agreements, occupied Indian land (and Tibet) never claimed (and randomly) barbaricay killed Indian soldiers pretext meeting (still got soldiers killed hid fact). Fact PLA CCP acting pretty maliciously.
And need Indian know this. literally Halloween country approximately..... Forever. culture religion, culture simply thing, religion considered bad encourage children dress murderers such, like vampires example, like, dude literaly sucks blood people's necks brutally murders them, good teach kids, get I'm saying? Oh btw I'm Serbian anyone wondering. never haloween, America. work, ""would died anyway."" Can't wait Trump actually use one....""listen, going die anyway, ok. hate break ya, market come back strong, it'll greatest comeback history."" cheaper Australia. parking runs $15 $20 AUD per day ambulance $900. 70%? expecting, say, 95%. ""The death one man tragedy, death millions statistic."" Yep. happened. absolutely insane. Again, specifically law breaking? ‚ÄúProtecting people‚Äù law. broke them? 

Hillary, best knowledge, also never stood trial emails Benghazi anything else. absolute fuck ‚Äútrustable figure‚Äù? 

[CEBM Oxford puts UK‚Äôs IFR since added age stratified numbers tell it‚Äôs well 1% based estimated IFR listed. Gu (who works governments looked consistent accurate predictions) said lower 1% now. likely 0.25%. one lying? 1%? sources say IFR double believe is?  Gonna cold winter.

Hope everyone likes simple meals. still found yeast. once, since March, yeast.
No Lysol disinfectant variety.
A genuine 3M N-95 mask.
Maybe California fire related weird item, almond-based non-dairy cheese impossible find. fuck, young people city anything go by, ones partying certainly wearing masks, social distancing, definitely partying indoors well. long lock for? folks work? driving 11 people around hours end every day get place place, yeah big take away. even best quality seat car, rear axle car leaf springed, front coils. road design incredibly silly suprisingly many points. 

Imagine coming right gps tells get far left lane traffic every lane... good luck Much reason people South Central America risk much get purposefully fucked many countries. 

It's even secret used border patrol train death squads Guatemala. So, yeah kinda shit. confirm. doctor.  ludacris price gouging. 12 bucks tp? thanks Also, much virus get important, outside wearing masks kept low too, guess. great news.  I‚Äôm going guess poster means Russian collusion accusations, electoral college outrage, Steele dossier, Kavanaugh filibuster, RUSSIA, impeachment hearings, Russia, Russia. 
Even leftist admit Democratic Party trying undermine 4 years straight probably overplayed Russia angle. fact fight impeachment knew didn‚Äôt votes pass showed questionable judgement. 
I‚Äôm glad tried hold accountable, also see constant assault left cause narcissist like Trump start dismissing entire left, including scientific community deferring COVID matters. definitely is, they've got science. know make noticeable even make sense try covid cases that's totally gonna get scrutinized. wanna go low profile, high,, committing federal crimes, i've heard.  Gentlemen, clock ticking, synchronize death watches. Yay! We're number one! 'Cause we're fucking dumb! fat sounds like work. hurt people take easy body repairs unseen damage.?

In way important rest flu pneumonia. covid influenza, basic principle rest required minimize risk complications same. Number 1 baby friend's dad fighting cancer family careful. surprise sudden one day he's ventilator dead chilling home cancer before. .. You...you okay bro? weird took another month democrats care it.... They've gone saying ""not bad flu"" ""just another flu"" ""just bad flu"".  Damn US stop winning? Reminds scene Band Brothers episode ""Why Fight"" soldiers made local Germans bury dead Concentration Camp, believe real whole thing  many 200k died Covid it? many died years world war reasons war? sickening feeling stomach that, ‚Äúlegally‚Äù illegally, Trump remains office this. 'Murica number 1 MAGA  Taiwan News... seems legit. need move DC rights? 

lol that's works. Honestly great example everywhere could follow. Airline companies like Delta/United/etc make part standard. sit front gate forever anyway, might well get one rapid tests done it. Flu season coming.

Like, regular flu. uncle consul Bangalore Germany years ago. believe things told me, number orphans roaming streets, sth like 50 million, one knows such. understand India 1.2 billion people, live country less 7 million, can't imagine numbers, honestly. Poverty beyond imaginable diseases West erradicated. feel sorry people glad hear mortality low, tried add things simply can't true. 3 layer cotton masks effective surgical, effective n95.  No, language, grammar, writing ( center vs centre), vocabulary.

The exception using words use common language Spain, anyone degree/education able understand. 

And localized words expressions nobody use formal writing. let people die protect jobs, DUH.  surely meant ‚Äömentality‚Äò. Blame President, whose foaming mouth supporters took word wasn‚Äôt serious, it‚Äôs democratic hoax, it‚Äôs going away soon. Doesn‚Äôt matter governors enact, don‚Äôt think need listen them. mean negate impact 200,000 deaths, terrible tragedy. reality US country 330 Million people. math, means know 100 people, odds knowing somebody died around 1 17. lot people US know 100 people. Also worth noting people group know 100 people obviously close personal acquaintances 100.

My point although tragedy, country big enough actually little impact average individual level.  100% happen. Hey doctor murdered also...I injected bleach cure murder mysteriously went away... Building wall... objectively illegal breaking law? Excess deaths US way 200,000, passed figure early August. anything, districts US *undercounting* Covid-deaths due political pressures. one, hiding truth covid ‚Äúto cause panic‚Äù

Delaying ventilators prioritizing states

Firing CDC director, cutting funding disease control, ignoring fauci, sending kids school, holding rallies, need go on. think healthcare different 100 years ago. Also, know, world war shit. Hell, even went way assumed 50% deaths falsely called covid deaths, still puts us 100k, second worst world, India, know, country billion people.

Can't say I'm entirely surprised, US government people always put value money/themselves fellow Americans. like reality Every store individual seem like walking biological time bomb that's going make cause die choking death lung fluids. *Alex Jones intensifies* Winning. 
/s 
The sad sarcastic.  is. Anyone stating otherwise coming place major privilege understand means actually struggle means live actual terrible country.  Congrats 200000 US that? remember 300k, even beginning. early stage collapse fair, reused existing one Texas. tragic. people alive start year. So, fired lot people, made rest work keep jobs hope maintain ""efficiency"" later able get profit. 

All talks seem futile. trying negotiate virus. cut 25%, need one infected stuff guests exposed. either close quarantine every time, keep quiet stay open. Imagine costs associated potential close every day, things ordered, salaries. Imagine also unfair competition someone accuse someone positive stuff, need test close. really see happening. see bunch restaurants hiding whatever order stay opened, indoor dining suddenly lost appeal me. spoiled America think liberties taken away. That‚Äôs much la la land America is. Number one! Number one! 78 year olds human? Oh yeah doubt sunbelt really shot summer. I'm lucky enough state that's stayed comparatively low deaths (WA). post bit cheeky due ""where's apology?"" Shenanigans. Truth defended logic open argument, suppression. Censorship tool authoritarian regimes. dangerous slippery slope allow kind Ministry Truth dictate wrongthink. Checkout r/ubi r/basicincome r/qualityoflifelobby r/EssentialEmployees No, they're smart, reasonable, common sense. things average American have.

Life vietnam tough, thier country poor terrible medical resources. citizens know that, government damn well know that. top bottom, everyone know thier country collapse pandemic get control. instinct, they're one unite, put public's benefits thier fight thier survival. like war nations that's hundred times powerful. Hahahah thread hilarious USA NUMBER ONE

SUCK EARTH  fuck minimum wage job benefits? light end tunnel want. Even far away Trump links yes men important part. 3x deadly flu without restrictions, we'd call severe flu ask old people take care sick people stay home. lol people giving money Tencent People reddit like:
- China gave us Covid, I'll upvote 63%
- Vietnam 0 cases? Good them.. enemies Vietnam war.. I'll upvote 96%
- hell NZ, idk take upvote Trumps America loss though saddens me. feel bad we're Oregon. top everything we've gone state, deal this, too. shit breaks heart. really need another article explaining that? USA NUMBA 1 treatment probably going made soon. Ya would ideal, issue government body money right now. difference state, local federal governments federal government run unsustainable long-term defecit since power federal reserve treasury behind them. extended crisis federal government provide assistance citizens. 0! lib hoax made make dear reality tv host look head!! No... number people died also COVID system... 200k. Go CDC website read it. Plz.

The number 176k. Table 3 want Quick everyone act surprised Someone told ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even realize h1n1 deaths &lt;some needs terrorists got grossly incompetent president?

‚ÄúIt is‚Äù #1 #1 #1! dont undersrand US. go war cuz 1 mass murdered let one reign them. still considering hospitals lying 6% reported covid deaths without another medical issue? good real numbers clearly overinflated.

Also fact covid became political major flaw species Good luck enforcing that. 

High risk groups first vaccination list anyway. part reason measures. People fed meaasures, expect shift vulnerable people take responsibility shield themselves, rather whole world stop move summer next year. Bad times. Bad bad times. came home healthy horse ready take world?

Probably fugck  üéâüéâüéâ yea lit AF fam Seems unlikely unless OP wife 80‚Äôs America first! look europe looks like cant fight thing lookdown. soon open comes back. (Except Sweden second wave.) true. especially grinds gears many anti-makers profess Christians. Apparently ‚Äòlove thy neighbor‚Äô doesn‚Äôt amount even minor inconvenience (or neighbor gay Muslim, guess). wish people treated love verb instead noun. It‚Äôs thing do. thing say. Yet tons wackos STILL think ‚Äújust flu‚Äù totally made political reasons. Galileo thought Earth revolved around sun. considered heresy. put trial, work censored, lived house arrest death. never really know truth come from, part it. opinions challenged become dogma.

I understand concern lose censorship gain. instance, grateful argument helps refine mine (and possibly find holes it). Looks country 300 million...

Looks huge front yard backyard...

Looks two cars...

Looks two story huge house...

Yea. really great I‚Äôm flying Colorado soon vacation. 

:) say death-rate kept 200k (even though time seemed like shockingly large number) would evidence success ""beautiful response""? mean metric he's failed? India far behind either... Congrats! 5% chance becoming Canadian. Become richer educated better odds. Director CDC, Robert Redfield, said might one greatest challenges public health system modern history. Hospitals, general, full fall winter.

Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, said epidemiology coronaviruses, general, change fall winter, anticipate resurgence. Gottlieb suggested may hit new highs (daily case counts) fall winter. 

Fauci said needed 10,000 cases going fall better shape, we're far mark. We've little bit 40k past week, he's worried. 

Michael Osterholm said numerous times pain suffering we've far far over. estimates daily cases surge weeks come. 

With said, none provide solid numbers, seem genuinely concerned, especially hearing voices. factually happened. google sources too. numbers absolutely boosted make look worse is. president bash masks july? well call hoax everything control. governors refusing lock worst states. worst response due sheer mind numbing fucking incompetence. 

Death percentage also nothing population size. value based many people survive virus. total population cannot inflate number, yes, US's one worst developed countries. would argue mere fact one worst death ratios despite richest western nation even embarrassing makes US response much worse. 

I mean next two countries behind US India Brazil. two countries ( especially india) massive poverty within portions populations. United States fucking America area borderline third world countries *embarrassing*.  someone complains wearing mask. Ask would wear mask would cure cancer US. explain forms cancer together kill around 600K people per year track kill 300K. enjoy mental gymnastics struggle information. yah? 

This time caught it, ‚Äúfixed it‚Äù, event counted Cv19 death count, many others are? Three million dead probably. Ladies gentlemen, Expiration Date script adapted 2020. Americans taking number one spot eh Also worth noting 75% deaths age group least one underlying condition to. It'll get worse months winter comes around treat sick covid patients also sick influenza respiratory infections seasonal. Hopefully social distancing flu season bad typically is. average age death? NZ's measures nowhere strict China's. NZ anti-mask idiots, China 

 ['We silenced' - Maskless anti-lockdown protestors march UK: Three days! Yes! THREE DAYS LIVE! Easter 2021, right eventually UK: Well, let's see. get hundred victims, let's say, six times day... Times four months. Minus, we're bread. Hmm. Wouldn‚Äôt multiple deaths 4 rides? Bow said going disappear? also depends effective vaccine(s) be. FDA accept vaccines 50% effective duration immunity. first vaccines low risk people still need take precautions support state local government requiring masks public indoor spaces (workplace, stores etc) outdoor areas people cant distance - majority people vaccinated vaccinated effective enough vaccine achieve herd immunity.   ...well, brag, Libcuck72, husband engineer nestegg. likely latter US right-wing better. Hell yeah brother, damn libs theiyre‚Äôre understanding population pisses tell friends stop discussing plans me? Yesterday trying get come hang them, continually say "" No, cant.

My sister medically immuno compromised medicine month shes vulnerable right now. also non-allergenic asthma, ever get cold get barky cough trouble producing phlem becuse airway restricted without medication. also live mother around 50 years age. love hearing talking we've doing, wish would stop asking hang multiple times even though tell stop. 

Any ideas? already told going can't hang multiple occasions, last night skype call turned microphone took headset trying get come felt guilty reason.

Edit: told feel free hangout without originally asked would there, absence shouldn‚Äôt deter asked like 10 minutes couldn‚Äôt come, saying don‚Äôt high rate infections we‚Äôd stay 6 ft apart. proof permanent 21 year olds? otherwise shifting goal posts. would hard pressed prove wedding couple ""knowingly"" intentionally tried spread Coronavirus wedding.

IANAL, doubt case would hold court law. USA! 

USA! France: *long* these...strokes kill us? Ah, good old appeal emotion data fit narrative. Trump supporters continue say nothing could've done. reminds story excellent podcast ""Missing America"":

Around time 2014 Ebola crisis, US Cuban envoys Vatican final stages negotiations regarding normalizing relations, referred [Cuban US envoy, Ben Rhodes, asked Cuban envoy, Alejandro Castro (Fidel Castro's nephew) Cuba could send doctors part global effort fight Ebola. podcast: ""Within weeks, hundred Cuban doctors headed West Africa; US aircraft.""

This first time decades, ever, US asked Cuba anything treated partner, great example international cooperation *should* work faced crisis. Oh, one actually fixes it, enough people shoving arse.  Rookie numbers Canada: goes ya. there's something y'all wanted ya...Well.¬†Died.¬†Now¬†would a...good time. anything argument unnecessary hospitalizations thing US? I've noticed Germany since privatization hospitals (who tf thought private hospitals good idea...) recent years I'd assume guys would even bigger problems it. I'm sure anyone taking 2 week old account seriously. Ah, tyranny. Apparently acceptable adays. Canada: Whoa! Whoa... exactly, USA. research *much* virus like
. Ah swapping long term complications argument mortality rate fit yiur narrative. What's rate ""permanent"" complications 21s. 

Remember group tend need hospitalization, bother posting study complications icu patients evidence Always always will! Hence Fauci comment. apparently always right according you. Interesting. long starts claiming ""real numbers"" way lower? 


He's likely going lie get it, it'll likely work audience Somestimes feel like virus affects brain makes people wanna spread like masks, partying, touching everything etc pharma guy newspapers keep writing biggest vaccine manufacturer , probably may true would thought best way keep numbers low downplay virus; convince large portion country stop wearing masks, get angry quarantine measures, outright hostile wear one. wear mask automatically means liberal communist hates America, right? Yes but. count EU together also 180 000 deaths. UK Spain Belgium (and many less developed countries) death/1 million. (Above 600). extreme. decisions mostly federal levels. 

But rub. 

Rhode Island, Mississipi, Massachussets New Jersey New York Louisiana Connecticut almost double proportion deadly cases /1 million - 1100 - happen anywhere world country. (But add France Spain two countries Western EU get number. much extreme again.) That's insane. dad takes oxy, could easily happen him. hate shit. wish oxy fent fucking thing.   USA: Arrghh! cannot research virus anymore!
**Choking Australia table** unusual make dig graves cruel face dead mistakes. frankly i'm it, get facebook get labor still 3.5 months left. Shits gonna get worse. It‚Äôs estimated less 5% population contracted virus. one mentioning specific countries, funny first come mind. long US? reasons staying? problem high rate false negatives - it‚Äôs around 30%. accurate testing, BC pursuing strategy contact tracing self-isolation close contacts positive cases. mostly pay attention Dr. Bonnie Henry BC, rather Dr. Tam, would imagine federal government following reasoning regards 14 day self-isolation rule travellers entering Canada.

Everything would much better accurate test. There's restaurant used order called DJT.

Dragon Japanese Tempuras Sorry 2 lb bag yeast bought April. Haven‚Äôt even opened yet. üòã Apparently supply problem packaging. 

Also found N95 mask last round smoke two years ago. feel like king wearing around town. metric? Plenty countries much worst case fatality deaths per capita rate. Basically area US worst total deaths/cases thats almost purely due population size. /r/agedlikemilk crazy thing right .06% What's unofficial count? Good job, California Actually obesity hardly kills anyone. blood pressure heart disease(Facebook, 2020)

God libs make sick! ""it's happening - opinion, fact"" - Elon Musk 


How argue people even Elon Musk endorses idea? :( sub always scaring people compliance. convinces anxious people die go outside, people pointing young people low risk gets voted. Canada: Y'all know means right? Republicans see way. see death possible evil democrat wiped earth, unable vote 


Source: trump loving family excommunicated  UK: Strokes! So, uhh, supposed done? 2 different numbers. think average age covid death actually 78, median age 71. dunno tho. Australia... Everyone said EXACT thing 2016. naive. 

Get Reddit too. Reddit political opinion irl. Crickets... Yawn. love kids can't actually form logically sound argument resort pathetic Rhetoric like actually anything prove lacking. 

""Rules"" opinions, get force people things fragility hurt people living knees like you. 

Trump's different tyrants, so, how's relevant? Oh, right, argument anything ""but trump!"" go to. Technically, isn‚Äôt 200K people live USA died tested positive COVID-19?  Canned pumpkin. wife tried weeks find without luck. friend ordered Amazon weeks shipped badly banged cans return. IHME running low projections earlier year. changed model Summer became lot accurate. changed model recently. project 415k-650k year, depending masking social distancing roughly stay relax. use saying time, definitely true. country, mean wildlife scenery Facts don‚Äôt care feelings bro Sadly, [there selfish pricks back well. man, woman children too. That, COVID exclusive deaths less 10k. others major contributing factors. Congratulations! :)   Zero leadership

We would better actual zero leadership. Trump admin actively encouraged various things contributed spread virus, downplaying threat, wearing masks etc. I'm similar age, lost sense smell (not taste) completely felt like breathe enough 3 weeks, fully recovered. guess body aches first days  country holds roughly 66.8% population entire continent thats bad. Especially comes fact death figures equal 0.06% country severe health problem due people failing look themselves. Whaddup ü§ò

Didn't take 2 months prevent strain health care system. point goal shifted flatten curve move curve near zero. agree? yet we‚Äôre still seeing 1700 cases day. hasn‚Äôt slowed down.

Yikes... Ontario seeing 300 cases day (rise average 80 day early August) government already gone ""We want another shutdown practice restraint might choice"". Mind 14.6 million people too. 

But god school reopening joke here. Slap stickers ground, try get 6 year olds wear mask 6 hours day call day. Oh yeah, kids eat lunches room cause virus takes break noon. possible deaths covid related actually caused covid all.

Any death covid-like symptoms recorded covid death, even testing done ensure patient actually covid.

For example, coughing, chest pain, nausea, die, recorded covid victim, even though countless diseases share symptoms.

If covid, technically die heart attack, still recorded covid victim.

I doubt 200,000 accurate everyone thinks is, could way less could also way since capable extensive testing early stages pandemic.

I distrust covid statstics face value since covid heavily politicized, hospitals *may* recording covid deaths financial gain (although proven).  record low cases today San Diego. That's something. 265 cases. 0 deaths. 1.5 million population actually explain ""death percentage"" is. 

If mean case fatality (how many people virus die) US worst developed western nation. 

If mean deaths per capita (how many deaths per 100,000 population) US worst developed western nation. 

Did mean something different either those?

Also Trump call covid ""hoax?"" point quote? Dude cringy. master satire well tyranny, also seem understand word ""violence"" means. chose top state, reason that. general, take longer become serious South America North America, India still peaked, Australia peak middle winter. course many factors play though. Congratulations guys! it!


Wait... again?... Yet everyone says ""so say"". hate idaho fucking much. ok. die. Eventually. Everyone will. goal survive finish line. That's really life about.

But yeah, someone vulnerable. live alone. two dogs one snake that's it.

And ultimately matter. almost 1700 new cases yesterday 10M country, question time lock us least close bars restaurants. Classic etre_be, almost missed you, lockdown place prevent strain already poor health care system spain. Never eradicate virus. I'd say adult/teen parties would bigger vectors. Kids mostly outside, parties people indoors drunk.

And help stores exact amount stock candy year. Like clear live (Ontario) seeing rise another wave now. Sales gonna lot lower many parents gonna allow kids go candy regardless health officials says trick treating fine not. also working COVID-19 vaccine. Starting trials now, fully adhering guidelines. Republican party gone way deep end. better time leave now. Doctor SERIOUSLY debunks Ivor Cummins whole ""Casedemic"" Lets shoot upwards 1-2 million time we're done it!

Then get focused accurate data years look back, learn maybe 5-6 million!

KEEP COVID GOING question people USA, frequently see that, like article, schools employers list ""the number cases disclosed"", that? important parents kids school employees know information? benefits disclosing it? School employees typically work state, private company protect profits ensure. can't patient data protection, simply saying 200 kids infected without names identifying information violate anyone's privacy rights.

Can anyone explain this? idiot politicians? schools wired political landscape USA? post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

I fixed sentence yea.

If China honest first months (For December March), even sub reddit first place. Americans figure two sides coin nothing change. Fighting differences instead comming together. Duh   shit, predicted 2015. Youtube recommending this. Great sense humour. time, US went ""its flu"" ""should wear mask not.""  üá∫üá∏ U A! U A!

Accomodating meaningless consumerism sake profits got us climate change.

All products become waste point, ships, planes trucks use send crap making California burn, China struggling floods, hurricanes, locusts, Amazon Siberia burning, still remember Australia, right? Europe fires woods dying pests found climate change favourable. Oceans poluted, continent sized olastic island middle Pacific. moment heard collected enough money repare Notre Dam 1 hour, money would resolve floating trash disaster, moment realized go end this.

Nothing would stop fear death, massive scale, see, minimising threat already happening wheels consumerism continue, profits really rich pilling up. Trust me, Bezos self isolate. Nothing provides better insulation money.

So, humble opinion, everything run opened threat virus becomes obvious. Someone know dies, someone close them, word spreads around. fear kicks restaurants bars business, matter managed keep quiet someone staff positive simply asymptomatic know it. see restaurant supermarket closed big red writting ""closed due stuff positive, came know someone, get tested""? No? course not, send emoloyees home continue working. Costs closing every time like would kill business 2 months. So, going see interesting winter, would like sth bs expect comments, due stupidity selfishness brought virus existance first place. That's interesting point, Bid Dick Owl Fucker, I'm glad brought up. personal opinion aligns Trumps, allow people terminally ill volunteer testing. think pay handsomely contribution science medicine. think expand ""Right Try"" people terminally ill suffer significant reduction quality life due illness. people need read unexpected deaths every state‚Äôs obits. state several young people die within week every week... normal! get people don‚Äôt want tested especially death!

That's joke, serious thought work--the geographical boundaries conducive geographic solution. likely already close 300k already, deaths counted yet. 300k pretty much lowest number possible. confirm influenza complications. borderline pneumonia allowed rest recover beyond taking antibiotics. kept push days, collapse days, couple months after. lungs still pretty fucked 3 years on.

There's always Russia behaves remotely similarly much respiratory infections do, second wave arrive sometime October. Deaths begin spiking around mid October peak sometime November. 

Now ingredients massive wave like Spanish flu, hopefully slightly larger first wave, still enough get us within spitting distance 600k. Note already 200k 3.5 months left. lot happen. I'm sure I'm fairly certain way back april march estimates saying around 1-200,000.

Did 200,000 ppl die COVID 19 ? You‚Äôre original statement refute fact came China. didn‚Äôt say scientist found one sample waste water COVID, skeptical may cross contamination. Much needed context.

We gotta #1 Jackpot. *Achievement Unlocked - ""Muh Rights""* probability extremely low. stop anything risk dying could anything. 

Do understand chance risk important making decisions? Also virus picking choosing randomly, objective bias towards old people fat people (because health issues arise much weight). Global? Mostly US protect 0,4%

more like 40% fatlands ever visited Hispanic home? got 3 generations living one roof. 

They stuff 'em like sardines, expect? Wow, 9 deaths. Seems like picking now? high contrast ""Sweden lowest spread"" news we've flooded lately.

Maybe can't trust numbers Sweden... Completely agree there's lots great real time strategy games like them. I‚Äôm opinion nobody, particularly 70 year old multiple health issues, guarantee aren‚Äôt going medical episode requires seek urgent care hospitalization flu season, time won‚Äôt able avoid exposure people. 

A flu shot pretty brief contact health care provider likely least surgical mask, I‚Äôd say worth risk. U.S. greatly overestimate many deaths caused covid. apparently 30-50k deaths, remember saw though Oh shit. Fair enough.
My hubby engineer. Hate sound like parasite bringing degree, marry said could stay home kiddos. again, go back work heartbeat feel like kids safer place. Admittedly horrible bet back April 3rd friend bet number US COVID deaths - said 350k - said 300k - sincerely hope win might die. That‚Äôs thing, even something rare 0.1% die that‚Äôs still 1 every 1000 kids university getting bodied.

0.08% per article 21. make stat literally report ? That's 8 per 10k reference. there‚Äôs outcomes dead/alive - kids suffer lifelong health problems adults told virus wouldn‚Äôt hurt them

This yet determined, know several complications associated covid recover time observed viruses. vast majority children dying COVID-19 Hispanic, Black Native American

The original CDC article makes distinction race ethnicity media comes along confounds them. Bang job nonsensical headline, NPR. Remember Trump re-elected? Oh wait, one didn‚Äôt happen yet. What's cause 340,000 deaths past normal predicted amount year then?

Far people US died year compared year normal circumstances. one big thing different year happen past decades annual death predictions based of. American apologize *everything.* us trying better!!

I wonder Quebec country would like lol. love visiting Montreal rural areas beautiful. Even people fine get know quirks (just like anywhere). Don‚Äôt forget hamster studies!

You can‚Äôt pretend people don‚Äôt exist lockdown wasn‚Äôt real, doesn‚Äôt fit authoritarian wet dream ‚Äútrue‚Äù lockdown looks like completely binary thing either live things perfect die.

Tends statistics work. per stats 8 per 100k died 21 year olds. couple months ago people thought Swedes pest thanks strategy went with.

Congratulations America, you‚Äôre #1 something again. Well, easy subjective. job demand qualifications put Canadian candidates? stand decent chance.

Yes well everyone thinks numbers fake noone cares posted archive europe, 750 million people, 200,000 deaths. Europe 2.5 times population US number deaths. Where's opinion? 

It's fact US 350,000 deaths normal expected amount year. reported numerous research organizations. 

What else uniquely happened year could source 350,000 deaths? Stay tuned Americans brand new episode Ow, Balls, special guest host Donald J. Trump.

...  
   Oneonta require students negative virus tests arrived. university test students came campus. university also closely prevent gatherings off-campus housing.
 
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes Ah yes. 1% argument. 3.5 million American deaths fine logic. dont mind paying peoples healthcare saying. Well thats nice you. Ill take hard earned money handing like that! Sorry stupid question RCT stand registered clinical trial? that's quite good news! It‚Äôs autumn, flu season beginning again, really don‚Äôt see cases go down. 

I guess people need accept reality Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year‚Äôs end year holiday cancelled. 


Pfftt kidding, there‚Äôs still going people going cross country go back families holiday right? pandemic going stop spreading around   Well, that‚Äôs things go.

My wife, brilliant physician, amazingly smart.

When started buying masks January, told bother surgical masks protect healthy sick, vice Versa.

This belief medicine time, need studies it.

She fight even able wear masks seeing patients, even early reports doctors getting sick rolling reports coming doctors getting sick places like Hong Kong Singapore masks used appointments.

But huge pandemic observational controlled studies know masks work ways.

Sadly still tons people wrong thing. Try less $25 average american. think realize big number net worth really lol Nuance dead. Nobody willing learn anything information fingertips. terrible milestone Don‚Äôt live US would sure. Middle class well themselves. health... health insurance. Job security profession virtually guaranteed. Canada much love wouldn‚Äôt mind working US 80% probably pre existing health conditions anyway. Good catch, suspect that's case. region lot total deaths (these 7 bring 109 116) maybe reporting often went records start August. However, 2 deaths actually old ones, one unknown date, rest 6 recent deaths. seen anything outbreak anything. doubt it, personally. seems like regular ignorance stupidity me, believing morons say facebook.
I'm reluctant say boils racism, though I'm saying wrong. hard enjoy socializing everyone masks six feet apart. fine first kept saying months.

You can't expect everyone socialize like two years.

And Winter fast approaching? god love winning Wearing mask keeping distance enjoying life. pretend same. I‚Äôve lived worked Sweden, wife Swedish, kids hold dual citizenships, house Sweden, I‚Äôve moose hunting yearly Swedish friends almost two decades I‚Äôve spend childhood summers Sweden loved Sweden ever since. 

And guarantee open disagreement taboo Sweden country know well outside SE Asia. spring thought ‚Äú√•siktskorridor‚Äù (corridor opinion) bit like ‚Äúlaw Jante‚Äù Denmark - something grain truth it, specific particular country. realise wrong. absolutely antiquated stereotype, real. 

The way ex ‚ÄúThe 22‚Äù critical scientists broadly shamed ridiculed voicing opinions completely line international scientific consensus appalling. given space voice opinion nothing proud of. It‚Äôs bare minimum liberal democracy. wrote it‚Äôs ‚Äúmore enough‚Äù - ie much. 

Even problematic fact established media spend journalistic resources criticism many untrue statements Sweden‚Äôs authorities government. beyond embarrassing. shouldn‚Äôt need random people twitter dig email correspondence Tegnell, Giesecke others show truthful public announcements. Another example fact apparently one Sweden realised ‚ÄúThe 22‚Äù completely right original estimate actual Covid-deaths April level Italy early April authorities completely wrong. 

I don‚Äôt think idea much image Sweden changing countries this. Personally I‚Äôm basically depressed it. opened door wide invited covid 19 right living rooms walked away!

That's 200,000 dead counting rest world still believes science facts gobsmacked lunacy rules country! interviews get millions view one. That‚Äôs why. He‚Äôs POS different opinions. Dark skin reduces amount Vitim-D produce sunlight. OK dark skin &amp; live tropics. healthy New York London. obvious coloration found vitimin deficiency &amp; covid19. Oh really? check then, thank you! Europe total covid deaths compared USA resembles Latin American countries steep upward trend. Peru, Bolivia, Chile ahead US probably remain so, 

America literally racing towards developing country status. It‚Äôs ok, according mother virus isn‚Äôt even bad anymore go away November 2nd. virus cares US election. putting words someone else's mouth throwing fit it. lot pharmacies flu shots drive thru live. could minimize exposure still allow get shot. Ummm 30,000 - 50,000 less deaths would big deal. 5 governors send infected elderly back nursing homes. Shitamericanssay ask doctors are? Asking friend. Pick state look stats.  Millions college students hospitalized dying Covid.  Minnesota number college age people died covid 1.

People age group 15-24 (two groups data) almost 19,000 cases 372 hospitalizations 57 ICU admissions 1 death.

I'll let state choice.

Please try use actual facts part hysteria. Yeah believe there's around 246,000 excess deaths, assume real number 250k. late now. People lockdown again. even Muh Freedumbs argument now. 1/5 restaurants state closed rest bearly holding on. Another 2 3 month lockdown rest fucked. think get deadly October? Arkansan here. frustrating. We're seeing record high cases counts week lately, new deaths double digits daily, yet everyone acting like pandemic over. governor gone weekly press conferences instead daily. coworkers kids school acting like totally chill get emails saying kid might exposed class. office talking return work on-site even though work home working surprisingly well. Friends thought cautious started dining restaurants again. making feel like I'm crazy one still concerned. can't. Play Trump's Feb 7 phone call Woodward them. question virus got since march elderly patients nursing homes coming hospitals severe respiratory problems. Never mind fact nursing homes mini hospitals staff went virus nursing homes became understaffed. Thats know now. Before, told, nursing home CEO‚Äôs, adequate staff PPE reality proven false. So, whole narrative Cuomo sent covid nursing homes would true if: a) Staff proper PPE pandemic style, b) Staff inmune virus. c) studies wrong symptomatic people spreading infection anymore 10 days catching virus.
But hey? facts, right? one underestimated anything.

People straight lied to. see humans getting medicine carrying around couple years would consider taking this. [Tuskegee much history pie skies ignore. true Europe deaths us forget cleaning forests.

Yes, want country world people stand trial behavior face repercussions they‚Äôve broken law - subjectively based someone‚Äôs ‚Äúfeeling.‚Äù I‚Äôve asked multiple times you‚Äôre accusing crime, since can‚Äôt answer either those, I‚Äôm forced assume objective evidence laws broken. Seems availability tests vary state even locally.  live, tests seem readily available results 24-48 hrs later. 

My sons away college tested four times (all negative) results 24 hrs later.   weren‚Äôt charged test. 

We actually administered enough tests test third population. 

The people know covid symptoms mild cases - sick two days back normal. don‚Äôt know anyone hospitalized. course have, point lot unknown things everyone acts like know correct. multiple conceivably correct ways see information, always are.

Personally, think quantity really care ‚Äútotal number potential years lost‚Äù, death count, since death count treats death healthy 5 year old (much tragic) death 80 year old already lung cancer (while also bad, obviously, tragic).

Since virus seems target old people people pre existing conditions (those low potential years left), focusing death count instead potential years left gives skewed view reality. people much easier time conceiving death counts instead total potential years left, we‚Äôre stuck metric.

Also check r.e. Excess deaths due 2008, that‚Äôs cancer ""major spikes"" pale insignificance Florida, Texas etc? I‚Äôm saying combination US ignoring exacerbating climate change chances us sparking world war three mean don‚Äôt get sit back watch safe distance. safe distance. next level trump won‚Äôt able resist power military use acquire natural resources, backing poor fucks corner probably eventually leading country like Pakistan sneak nuke Washington bets globally.  Good thing Americans like WW2 gas rationing intrusive rules required four whole years.

I guess would surrender today dammit need football/concert/hair cut/nail job! Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll cancel vote does. 4 years. Yeah Denmark started mandating masks local transit, 

sounds crazy asking masks. Germany mandatory since like April think? mask inside closed spaces, restaurants/bar outside table (e.g. designed seat, going toilette), mandatory inside public transport states train stations tram/bus stops   No, No. That's cure autism... Wait. No. people (wrongly) claim bleach enemas cure autism also claimed bleach enemas cure covid. president repeated claims. Gah chose colours graph. bit belgium counted every death covid death back march-april numbers inflated.

It's bit silly comparing countries early pandemic, it'll atleast 2 3 years real death numbers countries come out. Excess deaths going lower UK, Spain, Italy, Belgium etc. even strong spike. excess deaths negative end august. 


There also lack trend comes lockdowns, somewhere worked brilliantly, somewhere useless. US count lockdown trending similarly Sweden.

Source happens immoral con man politicizes pandemic.  Given much Sweden tests accurately measure deaths, I‚Äôd say numbers reliable.

Some countries hand...

Also, numbers accurate, people interpret something completely different point numbers necessarily accurate. yes, sometimes feels like happening might true reported. Come America better.

I think so. briefings outside Tuesday Thursday, updates outside Tuesday-Friday. highlights statistics news came last days.

* 9 new deaths reported today, weekly cross-check death register database positive COVID-19 test results. deaths occured 2/8 14/9 (in bit details, one death added 2/8, one 25/8, six others 10-14/9 one uncertain date still). 8 70+ patients (4/2/2 70-79/80-89/90+ groups) one 30-39 age group. *7 newly reported deaths region - Kronoberg - total 116 deaths since start pandemic. possible reporting regular past month there, that's still noted somewhere.*

Useful links:

* Good visualization information per regions english - ; similar source information intensive care statistics swedish graphs lag information deaths/hospitalization/cases per Another nice website statistical data - Sometimes lets pretend bad though... Oh wait Hell yeah number 1 /s shitty come jesus

Considering sizable number 'Christians' cheering Trump bring end times...  Pretty much lol. notice sources given...only tin foil hat conspiracies like much. Hahahaha, said brains? Good one mate Given fhm publish report every weekday assume Kronoberg one regions lump reports deaths large irregular intervals. Hence reported 7 deaths once. may want consider handling things ""pretty alright"" (ie. marginally better places like UK/USA/etc. grossly mishandled pandemic) something feel acceptable Sweden. 

It used not. Excellent article get it?

I mentioned covid related comment.

She made comment emails.

Which one seems topic? says 3% end march 3 weeks later 6%. 80%?? would great. stuck 50% metric hadn‚Äôt heard 80. country control people? literally put bars peoples windows keep locked up. country get leash this, believe china. stand gain well getting back action quickly possible. mention 56 percent *placebo* recipients Pfizer study reported feeling fatigue side effect vaccines. end wave imply virus eradicated. simply trough peak new positive cases. Denmark booming second wave. feature graph, subjective. second wave. mixed reviews lot people interviewed acted like problems one side sides. look too. case anyone confused, he‚Äôs talking past 6 months, currently  you‚Äôre one upwards 80% people asymptomatic. 

Or whatever percent left mild cases. Next year debate 6th 11th wave Neither side provided conclusive proof origin virus. That's point I'm making. right proof attempts debunk fall short conclusively proving stance wrong. 3) want kill grandma.  Pretty sure they‚Äôre quoting arrested development. It‚Äôs common quote toss represents wealthy understanding cost  I‚Äôd feel sad. knowingly virus passed onto I‚Äôd feel guilty. Otherwise I‚Äôm mature enough accept sadness death come life. fact didn‚Äôt respond comment shows don‚Äôt level maturity. sure like treading people Good sticking it! wish businesses live like that. Everything haphazard here. claim young people completely immune go ICU, old - would need around 13x young people achieve ICU rate.

Thats claim, claim made ""as bad"" reported be. would hospitalized since dont really worry (Unless pre existing condition really dont). would function kind like inoculation? 

This really interesting. I‚Äôm excited see pans out, small/tiny dose virus provide good enough immune response degree immunity.  Thats fair point. social media bad much misinformation sides. control could next big problem world sees. 

It‚Äôs funny right think it‚Äôs left problem left thinks it‚Äôs right problem it‚Äôs really everyone problem Really? mask mandate reduced transmission rates noticeably anywhere? Seems increased transmission across Europe, US several Asian countries. introduced mask mandates seemingly effect. Cool. already house almost month. wondering would disrupt chains transmission there‚Äôs widespread testing chance identify asymptomatic cases may unknowingly spreading it. given widespread is, 3 weeks likely long enough. Yep. shelter place went effect March. That's egregious! responsibility parents provide masks kids. Thanks dude [A detailed review available evidence masks, including 2020 point, direct evidence use medical homemade cloth mask wider use masks community significantly reduces risk.

Conclusion: wear mask. 

Even legitimate professionals *openly endorse masks* upfront fact evidence universal masking incredibly weak. 

You want mandate masks? Go it!

Have fucking honesty acknowledge aren‚Äôt making decisions based solid scientific evidence. 


From linked document: Systematic reviews randomized controlled trials health care settings demonstrated significant reduction acute respiratory infections, (ARIs), ILIs laboratory confirmed viral infections medical mask use although acknowledged methodological flaws smaller underpowered studies data paucity clinical evidence favor using medical masks community, **multiple randomized trials demonstrating mixed results pooled demonstrate significant reduction acute respiratory infections (ARIs), ILIs laboratory confirmed viral infections**. lower quality studies showing reduction viral infection rates households, transmission viral respiratory infections context mass gatherings, university residences combined hand hygiene However, **while systematic reviews randomized clinical trials fail show significant benefit medical mask use community settings, observational case-control studies (both higher risk bias),** suggested masks protective.

**According group professionals EXPRESSLY ENDORSES UNIVERSAL MASKING:**

**The large body high quality research shows effect.** 

**The small body shitty research shows protective factor.** 

Comb WHO/CDC statements, you‚Äôll find exact honesty discreetly slipped statements ‚Äúgrowing evidence‚Äù importance masks: evidence weak best, nonexistent worst. 

There‚Äôs reason research standards demand things like RCTs: shitty research, like observational studies, easily designed give outcome want; even assuming zero intentional bias, observational case studies completely misleading incorrect applied larger population. That‚Äôs saying Places people talk associated lower risk - exhaled lot less droplets talking, extra safe would recommend finding one good mask policy. Sweden spreading misinformation though. public health authority national media made clear numbers presented weekends mondays. usual, media around world trying make politics it. time trying put Sweden positive spotlight. Tomorrow opposite.

Low quality journalism thing consistent pandemic. Especially international media. Everyone trying prove point. Maybe. 



But expecting people get sarcasm without clear signs internet pretty dumb. knows answer. He's troll trying sea-lion people engaging happy-talk ""everyone already immune!"" conspiracy theory. Thats thing.  second wave. wave peak trough. One already went by, second. See graph yourself:  ""everyone"" failure leadership critical thinking. 

First, sent conflicting information people wearing masks. Confirmation bias, stupidity, plain old selfishness running muck. 

Second, creates trust issue next time say X isn‚Äôt needed, expect people buy / hoard shit X. 

Third, credibility wrecked. Anything say suspect lie get people behave certain way. used idiots people trying sell narrative. 

Small short term win huge long term loss. You‚Äôre fucking braindead, articles say thing (which reality common sense), it‚Äôs going take years vaccinate ENTIRE PLANET. reality first world countries developed infrastructure able vaccinate populations rather quickly, parts world lag behind. know would do

I'm still getting really strange vibe realize referring overall position teachers in. decided who's lives important who's lives not.

This need less government. exactly reagan meant said worst thing could hear ""I'm government I'm help"" methods work, nasal test may bit less sensitive ability pick virus, maybe improved since last saw research it. (borderline questionable) factual reporting based several failed fact checks.

They good source. said topic almost sub.

everything find online chance changing opinion / behaviour. prior education tip one's benefit detriment.

in Reddit least chance vote comment find detrimental, downvoting it. worry comments, part burying misinformation. Yes, like said, that's week week. There's indeed slight increase last week week. time, say cases Florida decline since July. includes week week increases Aug 6-13 Aug 31- Sep 6. pointed could meaningful, might be. There's evidence kind speculation making, especially since writing seems Florida account \~2350 new cases today.

Like get coming from, obviously view Florida's reopening despite high numbers potentially disastrous, limit speculation want credence. oh goody.  hall monitors here.        better? Yes. $600 per week unemployment government determined people need live, isn‚Äôt minimum-wage people actually working hard? isn‚Äôt universal basic income? Conclusive. definitely change minds conspiracy nuts... tell me. know would must know. Teachers money, far better paying jobs available. Old retired wealthy white folks reasons. See Also: Scientologyville aka Clearwater, FL Great point well said!

As theory evolution, voids understanding keeping theory (an example brevity 'the missing links'). HOWEVER, also large swaths KNOW FACT, I'm sure Intelligent Designer friends point tend fall ""micro-evolution"" side things. debate that, pointing even though portions question, IMMENSE UN-DEBATBLE proof areas, whole theory evolution vast all-encompassing concept lot still needs proven make scientific law. like gravity eventually get there.

Back main conversation, way specific virus got new DNA segment nearly complex concept, either mutated naturally synthetically.

The problem Covid still fresh news real appeal ignorance say ""We know!"". Give time, probably will, claiming either way silly.

..............................

Now continue, feel that's kind lack-luster response want less ""appeal ignorance"" response. Fine, I'll play devil's advocate bit. clear, none way stating think lab made, there's reasonable doubt ""Naturalists"" keep touting side fact without backing proof.

\- know virologists 'gain-of-function' research viruses

\- know 'gain-of-function' research performed receptors currently best part modify learn virus interacts organism's cells

\- know Covid-19 different caronaviruses unique receptor (furin cleavage sites) clean cut DNA currently known links natural mutation.

Now I'm going go road Wuhan Virology Institute, wet markets, Chinese secrecy, etc. going go path US virology weaponizing, lab-origins affecting funding, defending trade, etc.

There's definitely motivation claim natural paths, that's things start go path conspiracy. see anything counter 3 points made going way.

^(P.S. Here's tangent) ^(worth) ^(a) ^(read) ^(if) ^(you) ^(want) ^(something) ^(with) ^(more) ^(meat) ^(on) ^(it, technical. IMO, easiest read download pdf) think grossly underestimating many people come country thru open border foot, vehicle, boat. don‚Äôt borders locked down, therefore virus coming sides without people considerate enough quarantine themselves. Vitamin melatonin associated less severe disease, though age recovery quite smooth regardless, reports ""permanent"" damage exaggerated. Take care Lied like CDCs death toll numbers ""forgot"" mention 96% Covid-19 deaths co-morbidities extremely old people. lol, former boss told terrible poker face, meaning shows someone irritates me. wish need masks, I'm going remember people see face go back masks. bother makeup beyond eye makeup reason people think movies take vaccine everyone miraculously instantly cured. hope understand small portion europeans live London Paris, small portion americans live NYC.

Sure we're *most* densely populated, Stockholm denser Berlin LA, example. we're totally fine without masks lockdowns, euorope america be.

(I live Stockholm I've seen maybe 10 peope masks total time. essentially noone) ironic call people sheep clearly herded. It‚Äôs weird. second time there‚Äôs big difference regions. early second wave, cases stalled decrease weeks. regions exploding. One two watching sideline unaffected. imagine setback mRNA based vaccines. Interest approach may wane fails. attention funding quickly shift vaccine types. Hell, look local. Town grew spent millions upon millions massive police station loaded ford explorers swat-esque van, etc.

I think like 2 murders 15 years lived there. domestic disputes... Man sucks No. OK? Haha maybe get fresh air. Sounds like carbon monoxide issues I'd argue administration (rather public health officials) bear blame. 

The vast majority N95s circulation February/March cleared medical use (a.k.a. FDA certified), buy time administration could push ""emergency use authorization"" allow used healthcare settings. Imagine suggested everyone wear masks majority US supply purchased private citizens, leaving healthcare workers front lines none?

To me, Fauci's mistake overestimating American people assuming would follow many pro-mask guidances since (rather clinging inconsistent early messaging twisted, inane vindication wearing one now).

The administration bears responsibility acting expert warnings January issuing EUA industrial respirators healthcare settings. done so, CDC forced trying save masks healthcare professionals infamous guidance. Yeah, first time life could say introvert actually helped Nobody cares, belligerent prick. deaths hospitalizations? one full confidence approval process! don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs appropriate, term infection rate used US media, commonly refers infection rate proportion total tests time period, yes. 

I see mean could cause confusion. wanted clarify terminology.

Edit: wanted add infection rate, sense, useful heuristic answering ‚Äúare testing enough?‚Äù question, per comment test more, rate goes down. 

So test sick people show serious symptoms ER, infection rate high indicate we‚Äôre able even begin track prevent super spreading events community, isolate potentially exposed individuals etc need ramp testing efforts. Dr. Fauci funded it. chances. Maybe chances, chances infecting others still. Idk asked simply question.

If want answer easier answer instead writing this.

One grans parent lie dead you. god covid died. think feel that. Im interested that, stuff write about. Outdoors quite safe, fun sustainable, certainly, give trillion dollars wealthy away tax break print money QE, help normal Americans. quite while. idea every developed nation richest one world take care citizens height cognitive dissonance. opinion piece Toronto‚Äôs Dr. Isaac Bogoch basically said likely scenario 50% vaccine - means 1 2 people get infected disease all, person would still become infected, likelihood severe outcome (like hospitalization, death) would decreased. 

That‚Äôs good enough us. I‚Äôm wearing mask post vaccination (give take 2 months get everyone wants vaccinated, vaccinated). I‚Äôm social distancing vaccination. you‚Äôre still nervous that, stay home. hear grocery delivery services really convenient now. Oops, seems like someone‚Äôs conscience twinging realise partly responsible poverty deaths hunger hundreds millions :) Okay... get weird feeling realize talking overall position teachers in. like Indonesia's solution making mask offenders dig graves people died COVID That's like saying, want give someone herpes now, problem six months now... technically functionally true. home home. mortgage lien property allows lender take ownership property certain conditions met. also get liens paying taxes people work property. really good news? happens i√±fected travelers go south Africa countries (too poor fight covid?) ever said things oneself indoors?

If live suburban rural area, there's much space take nature walks, go hiking, camping, nature photography, bird watching, etc.

You spend much time others fulfilling life. Ok show numbers please. we‚Äôre going debate deadly virus need see accurate info. dealing US world wide? I‚Äôm looking current death rate 4% worldwide. 

Even .25 ok risking that? realize seeing lots negative outcomes aren‚Äôt dash right?

And EVEN you‚Äôre ok saying follow guidelines recommend professionals. teacher. confirm. agree you. Many people eat lunch, order dinner once/twice week, kids eat breakfast, lunch snack school. People used popping supermarket couple times week buy small amounts groceries. stock 3 meals day family 4 least 2 weeks mountain groceries! Wishing y'all best. shocked (not really, all) NEA done literally nothing worth stop schools re-opening. almost like reddit monolith Username checks out.

I'm crossing fingers I'll back summer 2021. Capitol Hill Block Party Seattle supposed birthday. Fingers crossed! say clarity, biology training virology training take word read many scientific forums webpages uncited sources agree you.



That‚Äôs creationist level logic got there.

You suggest many scientists read totally aren‚Äôt making publish results base opinion data.

If don‚Äôt data, tell shit fuck up.

Opinions without evidence worthless disregarded made.

Edited correct autocorrect sure...lets listen privileged uppercaste anecdote widespread data studies thousands news reports caste atrocities daily. They're copying Sweden, actually. ah ok. didnt see one. thanks info! solid governor (D) trusted science, attacked problem. Testing, lockdown, group gathering limits finally mask mandate. Instead fighting change fought virus. word 14-day quarantine still effect Texans wanting visit? Flights New York dumb cheap right now.  Reminds officials said dust twin towers going safe. Thanks clarification: appreciate it! logic backwards. 
These restriction sites naturally occurring. Restriction endonucleases isolated nature, like EcoRI, evolved defend viruses. Restriction enzymes recognize elements naturally appear viral DNA, way around. Furthermore, presence restriction site simply cannot prove think use EcoRI implant novel gene, *the restriction site already naturally present target DNA*. proportion daily wearers eyeglasses lower local population (5.8% vs 31.5%).

Wow that's huge! Well mask public wear glasses got going me. Interesting, hadn‚Äôt heard yet I‚Äôll read it. virus...is physical soldier coming invade LOL Thanks! reason phone auto spelled like that. Sorry pedantic, virus airborne. issue virus present saliva moisture comes lungs, means cough, sneeze, talk, even breathe, tiny droplets spittle exit mouth contain virus it. size virus 60-140 nanometers diameter spittle droplets small 5 micrometers (5,000 nanometers). That's basically human-sized virus riding airborne mansion mouth.

Here's scary part. droplet size mentioned spittle affected gravity, droplets fly meter mouth land ground surface. Spittle smaller, less 5 micrometers, goes aerosol territory. droplets light enough affected air, like spray products, stay air long periods time, floating around, passing air handling systems, breathed someone else. Thankfully, vast majority spittle comes larger kind, sneezing, coughing, lesser extent certain sounds make talking, generate aerosol version.

As long wear mask block things 5 micrometers larger, significantly reduce amount transmission do. N95 masks rated particles 0.3 micrometers (300 nanometers) effectively block even aerosol expulsions. There's really standard way measure whatever cloth mask good size particles, good rule thumb hold light cannot reasonably see light mask, block most, all, large spittle. also candle test attempting blow candle mask on. flame even move, good. (Please get close enough candle light mask fire)

In conclusion, masks effective worn virus. everyone wore one, would've done pandemic months ago. people respect that. Paris half people use mask noses, social distancing crowded area (bars, supermarkets), metro full always. fault miserly government America every single developed country doing: paying 80% salary people who've laid rona? 

Yeah, personal situation sucks I'm sure everything else sacrificed literally could've paid 3 months full bailed fucking wall street trump's cronies got measly 10% budget. 

So blame rona reality shitty government they're supposed bailing friends saddling national debt decades. 

Every single one friends laid abroad (UK, France, Germany, Australia) got paid government entire lockdown yet still somehow proportionally debt countries. 

Quote Draper want sunshine, reality got fucked government blaming disease like powers want ***when blame lies squarely them***. Yeah, one temporary measure deal pandemic, end this.

I‚Äôm fine wearing mask, it‚Äôs temporary, get past like 2 months get second dose, masks go away, think every state drop mask requirements really quickly vaccination drives really start power through.

My personal guess scheduled opening day MLB 2021 usually late March start gradually see mask mandates wind things, like Ohio‚Äôs alcohol 10pm end. heck downvoted?  6% number people even pneumonia died COVID.

So CDC said 6% US death people perfect health dropping dead.

Feeling better? That's disingenous best *//reads bunch comments like this//* 
Yup think I'll quarantine another year.

In related news: think starting get introverts happened evolutionary-speaking. Everyone fatigued.  Even want right thing. 

Now really get see gonna shake out, beginning. even close, believe wonder you‚Äôre scared. looking data set pull Sweden see North Temperate country spiking June later instead January.

I follow? Sweden's daily deaths peaked mid-April. ([Here's Sweden Pretty much time US Northeast European countries graph. Honestly, see single clear exception basic pattern that's suggested (sharp / short curves temperate climates w/ earlier peak vs. longer / flatter curves w/ later peak tropical climates). choosing places saying kind looks right work trying make scientific claims.

Sure, ""methodology"" obviously terribly rigorous, seem case correlation teased small one -- *looks* pretty overwhelming (again, clear exceptions) based much handful countries / regions. cherry picking I'll admit guilty including Caribbean island nations figured smaller populations geographic isolation would likely produce outlier results and/or less-clearly defined curves. Yeah, didn‚Äôt wear mask grocery shopping early days. heard CDC masks wouldn‚Äôt help weren‚Äôt necessary. second narrative changed, started wearing masks everywhere. wonder different things would straight-forward us jump :/ I‚Äôd think 250,000 absolute low end 400,000 seems like reasonable upper bound. personally think deaths aren‚Äôt going follow badly many people think, observing worldwide trends (I got downvoted hell June suggesting new US peak deaths/day second would probably top way 2,500 saw March). personal guess see ‚Äúthird wave‚Äù maybe get 1,500 deaths/day peak. Based I‚Äôm guessing near 300,000 New Years there's evidence vitamin supplements effect covid.

 thing that's shown get covid likely vitamin deficient, kind gimme considering vitamin deficiency known decrease immune function. Welfare checks Total? Nope. 1073 vs 8660.

Daily idk, can't find source, Sweden daily case data worldmeters. Your* happens print money. value money goes down, price assets goes up. No, didn't... compared numbers....   point one idea about. What's approved? vaccine? HCQ convalescent plasma, nothing vaccine approval process? vaccine approved given use population exactly? sleep-typing? Lol: ***tried*** relax arm shit indoors CVS longest amount time I‚Äôve indoors anywhere home since Feb, maybe overall state tension üòú

(That CVS wasn‚Äôt taking appts ended waiting 30 minutes; find one takes appts!) think overdramatizing things quite lot. know way news whatever country ruled fascism next 4 years. guys even want Biden? understand wanting Bernie Biden, judged German standards, nothing right-leaning conservative. give healthcare, gun control weed. Seems like less extreme Trump me. semantically correct used colloquially. Blah blah one listen use. Narcissism. Social media makes everyone believe they‚Äôre star show land exports entertainment. changing rooms.

What?! would people that? Usually public bathroom nearby. think problem anti-maskers seriously exaggerate (or straight fabricate) ""risks"" wearing masks. Especially compared benefit, even partially effective. 

Yes good nuanced discussion details. still seems like downside wearing masks hugely beneficial even partially effective. followed mask mandates, contact tracing. could done much faster tenth money congress

0% Trump letting go through. lack national effort lack contact tracing 100% fault. thought narrative masks protect people, wearer.

That's narrative people refuse wear claim personal choice/freedom. definitely protect you, guarantee.

I'm sure agree statement, really depends vaccine effective is. 50% cut it. Fair. pretty bad outside Vancouver too. However Winnipeg Manitoba 3+ bedroom houses less $200k. someone willing live there, irs pretty cheap I'm sorry interpreted post endorsement reckless behaviors like partying. Based passionate reply would hazard guess dealing difficult life circumstances right now. wish luck navigating stressful times we're going though. going pay high-risk individuals self-isolate indeterminate amount time? 

RIGHT. NEW TAXES. EXPOSE ALL. canada who‚Äôs gdp sunk 38.7% mean lot things make driving car safe possible though, Seat belts, airbags, speed limits, crumple zones, licensing, registration, maintenance checks, constantly engineering improvements year year. compare covid, also much reduce risk, working home everyone can, mask wearing public, distancing, quarantining, isolation, contact tracing. like bubble water lime

Oh okay, there's absolutely nothing wrong that. hear ""soda"" think tons sugar carbonated beverage. could kept pandemic team resources properly prepared would able gear produce masks. barely sew buttons, I'm grateful crafters Etsy! People think Bill Gates wants lower population. Meanwhile Trump going state state organizing huge rallies pandemic. No, read upwards 10 publications, instead wanking reddit day. Trump helm disaster. sign (government) rules plastered multiple locations including course front door... Additional signs City also posted (Aug 2020) City required ¬´¬†hand washing¬†¬ª (disinfectant gel) every single location person would need touch public object. see mingling partying all, congregating, lots people dropped picked drop-off area.... least 2 different Grocery store‚Äôs trucks delivering daily... people running pick food delivery (although surpringly infrequent now).

The Super apartment buildikg constantly mopping floors wiping door handles, elevator buttons etc. smells cleaning products 24/7. 

Definitely stricter rules place hundred times contact like nail salon, hair dresser, barber shops... Mistakes made. use chance smear. Yeah, it‚Äôs always going happen. Basing strategy hope 300 million people country get control madness. thing applies internationally. entire health care apparatus began seize ... seem understand devastating is... 200k deaths counting U.S. happened exposure rate 2%. could easily 4% 50% within time period. linear. Death counts low people able treated. health care seizes, forget it, oxygen, ventilator, steroids, treatment whatsoever. Untold millions would died. we'd big gaping hole economy except one alive replenish vaccine found. Stop listening whatever bs ""news"" source think enlightening you. mix recommendations people never get healthy levels even 1000IU per day. want levels close get sun exposure take 2000 IU per day.

The Mayo Clinic Endocrine Society recommend 2000 IU say additional benefits higher recommends 1000-4000 IU: ask high-risk persons self-isolate, encourage hygiene responsible behaviors people self-isolate, provide care get sick. know. Like we've done literally every disease pandemic prior this. would've literally laughed room suggested lockdowns response pandemic even five years ago. makes sense, U.S power influence refuse good citizens post rubbish without evidence news reports movie theater openings like? really want go Friday, it‚Äôs known spreading COVID. ""No one cared mask"" Colleges numerous people like brother hvac systems manager go average 2 dorm rooms day ( well many common areas) winter. comes home dad, retired 75 year old life long smoker.  matter way slice significant sprawl. mention kids jobs community (at least school).  Unmitigated Covid spread good thing demographic. Less close comparison what's we're currently doing.

You're creating false dichotomy. There's scenario every restaurant stays open (incredibly overblown) pandemic. less restrictions sure hell beats putting restrictions place actively discourage people going places.

Sweden's economy better virtually Europe demonstrates this. think combo ignorance, stupidity racism. addition anti-Asian sentiments, also directed Muslims. saw comments, supposedly women, commenting want cover faces somehow forcing Western women take veil. I'm paraphrasing comments saw, something believe myself.    


Meanwhile, men woman anyone else told wear masks. Plus whole virus thing. totally true. Denmark living less normally since May main restrictions large events. Otherwise social life continued minimal distancing summer. Asymptomatic presymptomatic though! 

You still contagious *before* show symptoms big problem. may right, could fallen victim ""repeat nonsense saw someone say online"" trap EXACTLY. HUG GRANDMA TIME DONE. miss that, thank pointing out. provide justification weapons ban random thing pushed Iceland study coronavirus immunity suggests COVID-19 antibodies last least four months  write hospital bed means worked. Dems ""causing shitshow four years."" They've reasonably voicing valid concerns total incompetence corruption within evil administration. Here's main issue article like it.

So exactly argument Intelkigent design advocates make evolution.

I don‚Äôt find convincing make, it‚Äôs appeal ignorance.

It‚Äôs artificial doesn‚Äôt follow logically don‚Äôt know natural path occurred.

Literally, underpinning argument irreducible complexity. Umm approved lol. That's approval part means. üòÜ

See fooling me. healthcare provider get hold vaccine approved use it. take 2000 IU main meal (it‚Äôs recommended take fat; supper always form fat). 

What optimum course get tested Dr determine need. really low s/he prescribe bolus dose get going. lol straight lie  52K people tested 3.7 positivity rate per state dept health.

Source interview Joe Rogan first honest report helped understand grave virus could . thinks second lockdown necessary know prepare wild ride .... I'll stick doctors. mean, still happened masks anyways.

So yeah, exactly right. Especially considering little US government gave shit.

You'd seeing lot healthcare related deaths point say initially. think there's also factor west (at least US) wear mask public lot older people assume criminal good somehow. else would hide face? *must* hooligans. illogical cultural biases really showing source countries lag? source Sweden especially bad lag? 1.4 million healthcare workers laid off. Rural hospitals filing bankruptcy left right. patrick! saved hospitals!

Tell me, swedens hospitals overrun? federal government? governors making impossible businesses run way profitable. *airborne. Even british English airborne. Either market bats actually live, far city. former teacher, caught saying ""If still teaching, would refusing go in"", easy say I'm sure would done. read obituary everyday take count. also research deaths free time. Stay safe! Rather disingenuous comment given known extremely low risk children, concern impact spread others.

The report squarely cases. apparently fundamentally wrong conclusion, closure schools little impact number laboratory confirmed cases school aged children Finland Sweden.¬† I‚Äôve never Tesco‚Äôs seen complete mask compliance across customers staff though.. always exceptions. Gyms also packed masks think wiping away sweat enough. surprising given many pandemic denialists throwing caution wind. Twitter replies articles Covid19 full crazy. Well there's evidence circulating Europe Wuhan outbreak. unlikely came lab.

We know cases community transmission France mid December testing old pneumonia samples.

Different researchers found C19 RNA waste water well way late 2019. March 2019 Spain summer 2019 Italy. lot data still needs peer reviewed, led Oxford researchers think logical explanation (especially look mutations virus went through, mutations suggest circulation longer knew). explanation virus laying dormant months, possibly years. scored right combo genetic mutations, climate, travel conditions infect kill masses began see huge outbreaks.

I think likely China blew whistle first better trained watch SARS outbreak. Wuhan likely one first major outbreak well. Clade may originated there, Clade L genetic predecessor undetermined origin.

Epidemiologists believe tens thousands cases Europe Asia late December.

And FWIW polled virologists around world, discredited made lab theory citing genetics pointing related natural zoonotic virus. discredited natural virus escaped lab theory, although several gave small % chance occurring. Although none realistically thought lab responsible, could 100% rule mind. though, notably. Maybe back first started worth considering, know enough write lab theory off. we're believing science there, seem possible. anybody know roughly percentage guests wearing masks? Cause death complex.

Consider something like pancreatic cancer. own, stays situ, kill you. However, spreads organs stresses body. patient has, e.g., pre-existing cardiovascular condition stress might lead heart attack stroke immediate cause death. However, pancreatic cancer proximate cause death without cancer, heart attack happened (at least time).

It's COVID (or flu, pneumonia, etc). virus stresses body proximate cause death. immediate cause death likely organ pre-existing condition, perhaps patient's weak point, without COVID happened (at least time). bubonic plague still around. You‚Äôre never getting cases 0. turned into

The goal always keep curve flat. point experts say flatten curve let go hospitals overwhelmed Houston places world didn‚Äôt end. 

That's largely businesses events closed, reduced capacity and/or hours. good. better people saying ""fuck it"" careful. would like things normal too, thing control. Outright thinking virus contained vaccines get distributed seems foolhardy, I'd rather wait low cases going places without distancing masks.

No one stay home years, people asking, taking precautions still need happen cases become manageable. Agreed fronts. Despite extremely vocal hatred non-pharmaceutical intervention, actually support lockdowns back March. scared. ""two weeks flatten curve"" kept getting indefinitely extended. US shamed lockdown protestors ""domestic terrorists"" weeks entire country cheered police protests. point April May saw antibodies tests NYC put IFR 1%. destroyed entire narrative, didn't. I'm ashamed content people whole thing. ask coworker stop confusing Italian country mother. 

By adjectives he's throwing around, clearly mom he's referring to. 98 percent population also ask Defense Production Act. People outside medical profession usually can't find N95 masks. people find buy something effective preventing wearer others contracting virus. Also smoke west coast states huge problem even healthy people. N-95 masks really needed 6 months since COVID-19 years since sudden increase wildfires. 

Trump visiting California asked climate change, said cool soon. Science probably know knows... Maybe government remove impeached Trump maybe Mike Pence could help invoke Defense Production Act, congress without Dump's cooperation? rather love people like guy responding outright tell taken seriously. one example President spreading lies conspiracy theories pandemic: you‚Äôre worried infectious diseases, Coachella never plans anyway. Certain places Phoenix wear masks. st risk still hide anti maskers. rates infection certain areas may 20%. Know least ASU trying random testing find . proven seriousness infection depends virus load. Masks reduce expelled inhaled virus loads.

So wear masks make big difference. Even 50 % efficient masks cut infections 75% rest 25% get much milder infection.   Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Not mention neither article mentions Tegnell claiming Sweden lowest infection rates say. point invoking name shock effect. want hear something scary? enormous number infections world, we're talking lot SARS-COV2 reproducing... mutating. We've already seen several strains virus, virulent others. 

Now imagine situation like flu vaccine cover strains virus. Except still bad Florida. Well Sweden isn‚Äôt never aiming herd immunity. aimed flattening curve keep healthcare system collapse unlike countries forgot cases fell immediately dangerous level. Wrong: That‚Äôs messed up.

If choose go back normal, decision. follow, Americans. care life, lives elderly. wish responsible killing someone else's grandfather something. wear masks, socially distance, disinfect every package grocery comes house.

Besides, see polls? Also, CDC recently stated probably get take COVID vaccine summer fall 2021. That's okay, live another year restrictions. you, wimp?

You sound like one nutjobs r/NoNewNormal. Americans ones spreading conspiracy. Given media reach US media, course conspiracy never end. Thank - I've trying say exactly now, many people listen either side. lot people one side thinks gives everywhere ok open again, lot people think sacrilege even mention term 'herd immunity' 70% population effected. Whereas reality seems nuanced either wants admit. corrupt anti science morons run country, happens. completely disagree point view. I‚Äôm grateful nobody know contracted COVID. would completely different story didn‚Äôt lock down. feel sorry people living countries let run rampant. one saying people claimed sweden things perfectly... whats strawman attempt claim strawman?

There much reason talk sweden, counterpoint propose going herd immunity route instead trying contain spread. Sweden tried it, obviously ended lot deaths. Uk flirted it, got lot deaths. US tried spots rewarded deaths.

It pretty clear strategy leads lot deaths people scared enough voluntarily restrict themselves...

No one saying sweden worst job, crown obviously worn trump.  walks like duck quacks like duck, probably duck point need strong unified national leadership general feeling things like distancing masking patriotic duty every american support public health extension economy. Got chance get leadership coming soon. Yeah understand March people scared, we'd seen military cordons Italy people welded homes China, definitely was. 

But know virus now, seem reddit stockholm syndrome/concerns trump actually winning things go well. There'll vaccine soon high risk people, CDC expecting 10-30m doses November. [Pages college kids going party anyway, probably going work really well overall.  Nah, death rates higher.

Now - whatcha gonna cry next? I'll put plainly braincells - rub em together see something sparks: 


You giving single second's care language context worlds 8th worst per-capita covid death rate, deadliest months US history, 65 9/11s corpse count counting?

Oh - like it, keep self-righteous, judgmental mouth shut. 


Sound good? know - REAL victim, right? Australia (and rest world) first place.

If done properly, virus would died out.

But NOOOOO... Everyone think Economy, ""freedumbs"", etc... Congratulations! Well completely inaccurate, dead inside. Well already vaccinated hundreds thousands people three vaccines EUA‚Äôs. regulations holding back? Bullshit. corona deaths. Crazy apparently people dying higher rate initial infection, yet hospitals capacity. Almost like numbers pumped political gain! 

Gotta keep numbers November! brother law got it, didn‚Äôt die

29 year old health nut

He new onset diabetes though attributed Covid Ask decided Covid put death certificate hospitals. Early pandemic UK system was; 

'Anyone tested COVID positive subsequently died later date cause included COVID death figures.'

The UK since [changed way reported Covid attributing far many deaths COVID. NZ putting strict movement restriction every outbreak area, guarded gates residential area prevent movement people?

They taking seriously: NZ testing entire population outbreak area? tune upto 1 million people tested day?

Maybe. Definitely 1 million per day though, would get entire country done 5 days NZ centrally isolating every case, every potential case, every asymptomatic carrier every close contacts four category minimum 14 days releasing unless get two negative PCR tests results less 24 hours apart?

More less.

It's hard. I've yet see anyone show facts confirm comparable flu, go:

For vast majority population *less* deadly flu.

Flu IFR: 0.1-0.2%

Covid IFR: [0.05% &lt; that's lockdowns masks social distancing shit.

Emphasis ""shit"". Sweden none zero deaths/day lower deaths/million US. clearly marking everyone Covid. United States even 200,000 people it??! Sounds suspicious. ^/s Reported cases.

Ouch!! USA! USA! USA! didnt masks lock downs world , thats point I'd rather keep social distancing anyway instead getting shot vaccine that's tested like 8 months. I'm anti-vaxxer fear getting microchipped, injecting vaccine virus showed even year ago sounds like dumb idea. studies people put high doses medication get shot up, feel side effects, that's push ""safe"" soon possible. vaccines medical purpose, political purposes.

They next conspiracy theory anyways. Exactly. doesn‚Äôt matter kids get sick, he‚Äôs saying. Pshhh let go that's fault. Maybe move another country that's countries focus. can't even understand number. get maybe 25 gets fuzzy. US lost 400.000 people 3 years ww2 fighting. coronavirus took 200.000 6 months also said noise wind turbines make cause cancer. ü§™ It‚Äôs kinda hilarious people decide class individuals holy something. pregnant doesn‚Äôt make special.

Doesn‚Äôt bode well climate change whatsoever. real problem going many infected kids going hug grandparents unwraping Christmas gifts? Speak bruh. 100,000 die good job Okay? day citizen would even fear getting disappeared NSA, would start looking ridiculous comparison.

Minewhile, China developed face recognition social score system that's scarier 1984 actively trying sell it, starting dictatorships. definitely trying export surveillance systems countries, designed ""national security"" surveillance like NSA (you NSA score watching go daily lives. Either threat national security watched shadows, watched all. definitely threatened told NSA).

The biggest threat freedom future humans China, shudder think possibility country importing Chinese face recognition social score system, every person world worry too. biggest threat world degrading bleak dystopian future China. Yea saw that. fucking moron. Good points - better pandemic management planning however would reduce numbers, they‚Äôre directly Covid deaths they‚Äôre still much related. 

The gun / gang violence haven‚Äôt seen numbers for, surely can‚Äôt enough actually serious impact totals? cases, even deaths. [Belgium still So, father 70, Type 2 Diabetes Parkinson's, needless say, high risk Covid. Doctor's postponed appointments told come in. using contactless delivery groceries such, otherwise gone anywhere, basically successfully sheltered place whole time. 

But Flu Season here, recommended everyone get Flu shots. So, go get his? ask would clearly risk contracting Covid (since would close contact someone get shot), no?  genuinely going anywhere interacting anyone right now, likely much risk flu anyway, right? maybe would better right now? I'm really sure tell him. [Belgium still HELL YEAH! AMERICA NUMBER #1!!!! ü•áü•áüèÜüèÜüèàüá∫üá∏üá∫üá≤ Quote: ""It is."" happened 5 cases soon none? hope everyone us government gets drops like flies... fuck people. Dat's Egypt, yeah? could happen trial. that's purpose trial. people administer data collect. lets say test 20,000 50 people bad reaction.. test 50,000 still 50 people bad reaction.. 

Just saying China society set much differently point could approve vaccine much faster   quotes refer ICU patients, break age say median age 63 years old.

Overall 80% people COVID hospitalised skews age like mortality rate. even smaller number hospitalised cases require ICU admission.

As example CDC back March ""with rate 0.3 persons aged 0‚Äì4 years, 0.1 aged 5‚Äì17 years, 2.5 aged 18‚Äì49 years, 7.4 aged 50‚Äì64 years, 13.8 aged ‚â•65 years. Rates highest among persons aged ‚â•65 years, ranging 12.2 aged 65‚Äì74 years 17.2 aged ‚â•85 years. ""

In recent CDC report ""COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate among children aged &lt;18 years March 1‚ÄìJuly 25, 2020, 8.0 per 100,000 population"" 

This makes initial assertion severely flawed trying extrapolate thinnest slither cases apply lowest risk groups.

Also may note OP used word ""permanent"" citing short term complications irrelevant discussing supposedly permanent issues.  Red Alert one games C&amp;C franchise. liked RA probably like C&amp;C games, maybe even real-time strategy (RTS) genre general (StarCraft, Dawn War, Company Heroes, etc).

I guarantee computer run without issues. reality mouse model - human model maybe 5-10% success.

The chemistry important one though, there's million obstacles get past, like whether safely give people enough effective scale, whether ill effects too.

Mice hamsters close enough us know things like potential harm humans. Yesss!! Keep america great... lol  Trump alone f*ck badly. 63 million voters helped though. GO GO GO AMERICA WINNING  üá∫üá∏USA, USA, USA , NUMBER 1üá∫üá∏ Oh wow! Let's hurry wait too. Yeah, kinda thinking too. believe Doctors everyone else saying important get shot, Flu spreads less way Covid, he's interacting anyone get it, probably lower risk keep isolating, Idk. virus pretty much spreading unchecked US atm, hard know safe right now, I'm worried Dad atm (my Mom too, lower risk him, still almost 65). :(

Anyways, thx thoughts stay safe! called Spanish flu country reporting cases all. 

Nobody credibility calls ‚Äúthe China virus‚Äù viruses don‚Äôt nationalities 2020 supposed smart enough know that. herd mentality working? already ü•≥ succeed getting borders closed, Trump never going different was. He‚Äôs much piece shit decades anyone who‚Äôs paying attention knew it. McConnell GOP declared open war us second Obama nomination 08, spent decade convincing voters democrats new enemy USSR fell. accept foreign help election, NRA laundered money, we‚Äôd functional DOJ would lot shit winding courts.  Mueller never mandate investigate Trump‚Äôs personal finances perspective deep debt Russian oligarchs via Deutschbank is. left doesn‚Äôt wake fact right intention playing rules democracy done for. Trump biggest tumor cancer that‚Äôs killing us, America deep shit right now. election anything less full rebuke GOP idea recover. government washed hands covid walked away! happens! countries around world deal covid supposedly greatest richest powerful country world covid pesthouse!?

Our curtailed lives direct result US government policy. needed shutdown couple months govt put place free testing Americans contact tracing measures nationwide mask rule. course none happened govt shoveled billions dollars wall street instead.  true lol I‚Äôm always disappointed lack essential oils doctors office. Like, trying keep sick?!!! I‚Äôd walk right tell them, I‚Äôm still waiting balance magnets arrive. can‚Äôt Wish deliver next-day. probably 1% 200 000 underlying issues would accept 300,000 dead year everything reopen.

Which need stronger leadership national mask mandates, prevent many people dying!  dumb led deranged propaganda outlets trying cover total shitshow. 200,000 far. September, I'm afraid could still right.  mention second wave hit economy thats coming due businesses restaurants hanging thread due services offered outside winter hits people going want many things like eat outside. We‚Äôre Number One! üá∫üá∏ 

/s  srly know ppl think going go away Nov. absolutely insane. nothing, wait til Fall Winter. Proportion Gate's total wealth, half million probably like $500 average American. mean Biden *really* done more, amirite? He's got blood hands. 200,000 covid deaths Joe Biden failed us miserably. Sure are. said long time white house and/or republican governors intentionally fudging numbers.  believe them? said masks didn‚Äôt help prevent covid either. 

Check numbers come out. yourself. wrong talking conservatives. want covid spread, causing death misery, wearing masks practicing social distancing.  hate me? 
‚Äî Trump crying inside.  huge corporations. Huge corporations rich people. 1.4 billion pulling together beat it

This actually important part. people educated sacrifices necessary believe it. COVID-19 prevention described ""people's war"" China associated war imagery, consequences failing contain literately collapse nation.

I reminded videos back February went viral, called [""Henan Village Chief Pandemic recordings people gone back village Chinese New Year huddled village. village chiefs sometimes catch people street day skipping quarantine start yelling night village loud speaker.

You get get idea serious taking tone. really good public speaking. I've heard one really moving one went

""You see people volunteering Wuhan? think they're sons daughters, mothers fathers? think want return family Chinese New Year? door front house currently thinking excuses sneak tomorrow, that's door tens thousands people can't return risking lives save country right now."" V E ! vast majority children dying COVID-19 Hispanic, Black Native American, according new report Centers Disease Control Researchers analyzed number coronavirus cases deaths among people age 21 reported CDC February 12 July 31 year. found 390,000 cases 121 also found staggering racial disparity. 78% children died children color: 45% Hispanic, 29% Black 4% non-Hispanic American Indian Alaska Native. point need openly condemning USA turd country tbh. worrying USA thinks No. someone pointed out, population density argument valid. Sweden, example, highly urbanized, people live cities towns relatively high population density. 

The fact social distancing effective own, masks absence social distancing little stop spread. stages- approved stage 1 , 2 ,3 ETC. getting downvoted? want point out, one knows need 75% heard immunity speculating it‚Äôs around 30% know spend billions researching every year right? spend tens hundred billions treating it.   seems like comparing apples Oranges.

Like include India graph, deaths 10 times less. Indian say situation pretty bad, deaths reality, deaths/population statistic. Maybe meant Easter 2021......... That‚Äôs assuming literally entire population catch it, won‚Äôt happen. 60-70% population see people image. Also, certain scale difficult keep scale numbers mind.

If go concert football game line 20k 30k already incredible amount people. 200k would probably look like 10 times many. 7-year-old takes mask off, entire family's financial situation put jeopardy? 

More likely parents outright pull kid school stay home misgoverned country earth ...so reflect finally, even hiding data fudging records imprisoning journalists. Thank this, you‚Äôre absolutely right. interesting work/have worked device dev - would love hear more. dangerous part virus. Non-lethal short term. 
If virus lethal, can‚Äôt spread far kills host quickly. I.e. Ebola. 
So Covid19 unique combination highly contagious, asymptomatic many, long pre-symptomatic period, short term death rate low, long term damage unknown. 
In sense, it‚Äôs perfect virus. usual Right Wing politics bad Left wing politics good. going remove political posts, remove comments original comment thread. blaming virus Trump GOP. Depends level vaccine coverage needed ""normal life""- approx 7.8 billion people. need syringes needles distribution actual injection. 15 months seem overly pessimistic me. Removed. joke. need hospitalization? tough work Covid without tests. diabetes considered one top 10 causes death US it‚Äôs contributing acute illness kills person? 

Usually, diabetes kills heart failure attack, kidney failure, gangrene (edit: gangrene lot rare cause death diabetics, indicated /u/pxdwvogi. bad implying remotely common heart disease case).

Diabetes still listed death certificate primary cause acute illness killed person. lot typhoid pneumonia heartattack deaths officially. guys actual solutions ideas sub y‚Äôall like circlejerk deaths rejoice skeptic catches it?  cannot feel bad for, simply available information willingly flouted ignored. deserve pitied around cretins thats bollocks statistic. Half tests done india cheap ones 30% inaccuracy rate. Recovery rate stupid statistic point to. absolutely right, someone exercises heavily near daily basis, worries me. worried I‚Äôll asymptomatic, realizing I‚Äôm issues mile 20 bike ride. take vitals everyday now, exercise, end day everything done make sure everything normal. try particularly aware health body. Exercise one thing given life back ptsd severe depression it‚Äôs easy tone entire pandemic. try extra aware, try err side caution. isn‚Äôt worth heart complications age 30. also one things helping folks even get pandemic begin with.  Allergies don‚Äôt make immune system stronger. actually weaken make susceptible infections. Good job.  is. caste system dominates life india. lowercaste people treated like subhumans. one counts deaths. No, ""sensationalist"" say we're great we're number one factually factually performing shit level.

That's sensationalism.

This factual reality weak people like can't handle. There's one thing November like whats going now. shit never end get new real leadership country. count that! amazing man, I've attack chat non stop since I've r/coronavirus sub. Love it. Sounds right.  That's 1 time fixed, 0 many others are?

Zero, unless provide evidence otherwise.  That‚Äôs literally misinformation dude. think may spending much time Facebook. 

6% died *only* COVID. 94% died COVID *and* pre-existing conditions. 

It‚Äôs inaccurate say crowd would killed easily mild flu. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs slight illness pushed edge. good chunk people would 10 years live without COVID. would 50 years. 

The vast majority Americans 65 pre-existing conditions. It‚Äôs surprising contributes deaths. copy comment url change ""reddit"" part ""ceddit"" ""removeddit"" see. I'm mobile lazy, curious that's check. Sometimes get archived removed quickly.  proof permanent 21 year olds?

Let hop time machine... /s

You're going little sideways. ""moving goalpost"" new information comes light.

*However*... general point doomsaying fine. Long-term effects ""known unknown""--we reason believe may long-term effects, know exactly are, likely are, etc.  There's gonna really nifty, easy use website find testing, too. example would actually counted Covid death UK July. government said statement: ‚ÄòCurrently daily deaths measure counts people tested positive coronavirus since died, cut-off time testing date death. ‚ÄòThere claims lack cut-off may distort current daily deaths death rate? Cases peaking March April irrelevant given testing Jetsons lie! Let‚Äôs make 300k! country shit hole said shortage I‚Äôm getting mine year I‚Äôm high risk isolating, seems pointless reasons described I‚Äôm isolating anyway. least live allowed discuss patients conditions public patient identified. Hmm actually keeping literature since school started back up, believe mutation caused spike protein flexible increased ACEII binding strength.

I recall reading mutation increased Ab binding strength, sure mutation fully characterized past couple months. Victoria? California? Argentina? They've locked ever since March! Thats thing,he say anything even address increasingly dire pandemic situation country(or undead state economy).In fact key takeaways address talking increasing production Indian-made toys encouraging people buy local Indian breed dogs.

This also time students parents pleading authorities conduct nation-wide exams Pandemic.I attached link address below,see let know Hahaha. Stupid country run joker!  think means ""please reelect fuckers give shit pandemic""  BING BING BING BONG BONG BONG kids 30s. One likely go Germany happens, spouse baby. 

I looking America options. second link world? 

First least 263,000 people died coronavirus pandemic official Covid-19 death counts report, review mortality data 32 countries shows

And shows America 248,400.

Edit: also comparing different things, first number give excess deaths America till Aug 22, second difference worldwide excess deaths vs Covid deaths. live Massachusetts seen many walk testing sites sitting empty people don‚Äôt care.  wait till hit 300k, without vaccine breeze by. Congratulations USA! You‚Äôre killing üíØüí™üèº Lol  Exactly. real bad. I‚Äôm less 30 min NYC wondering city would shut down, Mass transit all. many people died poor decisions run NYC NY state. opinion human close it. Congratulations!!! ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥ told yesterday family member everything go back normal immediately election.  USA! USA! USA! I‚Äôm confused you‚Äôre trying get this. original estimates quoting made idea society would running normal state without lockdowns masks. Even precautions around world still managed kill million people. I‚Äôm confused doesn‚Äôt sound serious you? essentially first time humanity tried combat single virus precautions magnitude still affecting millions worldwide. fact it‚Äôs making society crumble doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs serious, think lot disagreement from. Idk... Less chances would win Hillary. zero, much chance rational, logical Americans feel comfortable. 

...Yes still exist. We're hiding tin foil crazies. worse zombie apocalypse here. Send help.   MUCH WINNING! bet 200k+ excited winning much! agree elderly treated well several governors sent infected elderly back nursing homes killed tens thousands.

[governors killing elderly Nah, wee they‚Äôd simply say ‚Äúit depends‚Äù. Well there's working vaccine. least domestic tourism industry absolutely booming making lot lost international revenue.  remember 2 million prediction absolutely nothing. Now, get regardless. Sad don‚Äôt realize impact sport world. remember 2 million prediction absolutely nothing. get there. Trump getting re-elected something many people still forget much real possibility (which probably contributing factor think it) get paid Soros Gates....

I hear time virus disappear 11/4. You.....

You got neeeeeed

But say flu

You say flu

OOOOHHH BAAABBBY YOOOOUU sound racist Yes, say ‚Äúthe libs.‚Äù It‚Äôs crazy. excess death figures CDC. resistance change.
It's crazy hot st George. Maybe able walk around without shirt. wear shirt reduces ""Freedom"". fine. Jews would left Nazi Germany chance mass murdered amirite?  Manuals? manuals? (‚âñ_‚âñ ) We're number 1 u.s.a. u.s.a. u.s.a. don‚Äôt even want know. moved recently, avoid taking politics now. Tell ppl spam common cold flu kills people even 3 million die, that's 1 every 100 people.

Ask yourself, many people interact regularly / know? seem bad them. made laugh loud woke scared new born! need lookup insults love, people pin entire world view opinion one outcome prediction (which irrational) base whole bunch decisions positions (which also irrational) fail recognize magnitude error mistake first prediction turns false.

This normal idea lot rational people, conclusions based false premise must also considered false new premises show up. many many people get this.

When Descartes first put idea paper revolutionary idea. theory like three legged chair, take one legs away chair crashes down. anything chair also crashes down, regardless much want to. 

A good scientist understands theory useful disproveable. There's famous quote evolutionary biologist would take make stop believing evolution: ""fossil rabbits pre Cambrian"". ridiculous answer is, highlights fact evolution article faith biologist, able enunciate would look like abandon large parts theory evolution. could unequivocally show rabbit skeleton laid geological strata cemented stone hundreds millions years modern science says skeleton could possibly existed, science flawed. needs revised.

Obviously, fossilized rabbit skeletons pre Cambrian, he's pretty safe there.

But problem comes get, forgive putting atheist hat on, religious thinking encroaching scientific world. generations people taught birth concepts can't disproven, must accepted, open intrusion idea ""this scientific fact can't correct want correct."" 

I'd far friendlier idea religion saw evidence religionists willing able commit line sand beyond they'd recognize mistake adjust theory match known facts. know ""pre Cambrian rabbit"" point would religionist, would something like God allowed certain type catastrophe genocide take place, stopped answering certain type prayer. already hear, mind, objections that, sophistry, a) God's plan might include free even cases benefit beyond understanding, b) God can't tested human objective observation.

And that's point. can't make declarative statement would take abandon God hypothesis. I've never seen anyone declare advance would look like abandon it. I've seen stories people realise line sand moment long they've sailed past it: ""it fiance died realised whole time praying hospital bed I'd talking myself, never prayed that"" kind thing.

Anyway. Back topic, covid19. There's huge cohort people every country, certainly America, simply lack mental tools able abandon theory new evidence comes along. mind dismisses information conflicts position, mind incapable enunciating conditions would trigger necessary adjustment position.

And people fucking vote. shocked got traction here!

I'm not. fit hysterical narrative we're going die unless lock everyone home 2024. Regulars sub generally ignore/downplay sort evidence, Sweden collapse weight millions sick people.

As deaths significantly increasing, I'd guess much Europe saw substantial spread among vulnerable (care home patients) early on, spreading primarily among younger population, risk low. much winning. need keep going. going sick winning rich. It‚Äôll criminal keep winning. Make 3 really care? Poor people die time... one cares people get healthcare need alllllll time. one million things killing people. Hey, fam 4 too, think I'll pass trade- lol case numbers increase, compliance mask orders social distancing increases, case numbers decrease weeks later...  case numbers decrease, compliance decreases, case numbers increase weeks later.. system oscillates around set point case numbers.

Consistent messaging government social leaders *could* convince people wear masks, given level case numbers. Lack consistent leadership, help.

There end ""first wave"", vaccine eventually distributed widely accepted. actually lived parents couple months ago. always subjected overhearing conversations it. Now, avoid subject. It‚Äôs much better relationship, it‚Äôs always surface. Okay, believe people naturally greedy, let‚Äôs follow logic.
Hospitals charge shiat load money treating regular illness. 
If someone paying hospitals off, they‚Äôd pay well already charge. Who‚Äôs paying hospitals kinda money? Wait... George Soros? responding person mentioning b-cells, addressing that. Sorry clear, intend mix like that. meant specifically mention b-cells provide immunity t-cells b-cells play role immunity addressing antibodies alone reliable. foot illegal crossers. nothing closed. joke. means like 300,000 based Trump appointees lying withholding. I'm mad got politicized. anyone right mind stand behind Trump this, particular? Fuck me, dude. always present fabricated opinions asserted fact? Lockdown bad economy young people. allow get away this.

Lmao yall sound pathetic delete comment. comment true perhaps? Jesus Christ long Democrats trying impeach trump again? pregnant things getting bad. It‚Äôs expecting moms don‚Äôt want go appointments, many offices cancelling them. due date groups full mothers terrified things going wrong doctor wasn‚Äôt seeing person. heartbeat checks, many ultrasounds cancelled well. including anatomy scan major issues often discovered. hope it‚Äôs like now, certainly while.  COVID19 damages lungs, making future concurrent respiratory infections DEADLY HUGE value It‚Äôs official, I‚Äôm tired winning.  Another Trump promise kept, we're Number 1! We've let 60,000 people since first lockdown 500 people day coming here.

In fact they're easing restrictions applications entry come 1st october need pay $45 admission fee see viable 2 week quarantine (plus absurdly expensive plane ticket get here).

We still 3 cases managed isolation border. never even close 5% let alone 2% mean 200k covid plus 30-50k excess unaccounted or, 

200k covid PLUS 230-250k excess 

Sorry can't brain today!  sure, cure least therapy helps prevent death would help reverse economic damage already done. end day without widely distributed effective vaccine, virus even cure would harassing us years.  That's 67 9/11's, anyone keeping track. got leave mask sake rights. happy now, Karen? Medicaid fraud big business. 

Risky, illegal, morally questionable, big business so. pandemic... nurse said lot people difficulty processing death hospital visitation rules. drop family member ER feeling kinda sick. see that. see deteriorate. get call ""You loved one passed away"" prepared it. 100-200K Americans? feel additional 10-15M people 2019 starve death 2020 economic Probably take account folks refuse distance/wear mask. We‚Äôre like month ahead prediction?  'We', lol. South-East Asia ""we"" highly valued mandated use masks since February. look turned out. going know long term effects vaccines? trump putting pressure governors shut down, anti-mask. 

You posit scenario trying right thing. even need go far. 

It would better wrong thing. point *is* harm, though, there's harm there's harm. masks increase infection, there's harm wearing them. potential benefit.

College privilege. excuse bad behavior. people think otherwise gtfo, go home flip burgers reflect missed opportunities squandered substance abuse sex. least one month ""second wave Europe"" deaths have, fortunately, really failed take ""almost zero"" levels everywhere moderately affected before, bar Spain.

People really need understand 1500 cases mean 1500 cases march. Wow, horrible leadership Italy have? whatever feels necessary Old news kinda Masks mandatory Japan wearing one perceived arsehole. Probably 90-95 percent compliance around central Osaka. really jarring maskless person gets elevator you, happened first time month today. even open gyms would big improvement me. they're prolly gonna wear Hazmat suit restrict 1 person time whatever headass restrictions put place üò§üò§üò§ without effective aid small businesses federal level

Yep, Senate going shit. even negotiate pass Senate version wrote, sure hell going negotiate House.

It's tragic. worst part immediately start blaming lock downs business closures rather complete total failure federal government. thought narrative masks protect people, wearer.

 CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield ‚ÄúI might even go far say face mask guaranteed protect Covid take Covid vaccine.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

¬† Exactly. Masks (also lockdowns safety measures) aren‚Äôt either 100% effective ineffective, it‚Äôs sliding scale. person ignore safety measures never catch COVID. person also follow every single safety measure still get random door handle. It‚Äôs still gamble. absolutes here, it‚Äôs grey area. Safety measures lower risk, don‚Äôt eliminate danger. 100%, friend ignored them. She‚Äôs investigated Army german authorities. endgame.. Automation means less workers.. means less people currency.. means enough people buying products.. means.. many places going drop sales revenue... literally snake eating itself.. 
No way hell type innovation investment profitable.. millions people money.. 

A country especially capitalistic one needs consumers.. Robots consumers.. People forgetting businesses automate assembly line important factor business model Consumers business like consumers looks bad investors regardless much spend. looks better? 1,000,000 people buying products 1,000 people buying product? shows efficacy promise? I've ever seen people remove masks eating (together), drinking bar (together), etc. 

Obviously taking walk forest people make difference wear mask vs. N95 lol gonna prudent Posting links absolutely facts anything useful mean sharing peer reviewed scientific data consensus. come people like assume posting link debunked claims non-relevant information amounts anything useful? CDC saying masks work since day one. know reading, likely official website. people camp seem eager gamble communities' available hospital beds  People can‚Äôt help go work? Like healthcare workers? forced exposed selfish asshples like you? Yeah, China consumed huge portion global N95 mask supply while. So, reasons mislead us correct, it‚Äôs nobody fully thought unintended consequences. 

It‚Äôs literally clusterfuck global proportions, Donald Trump one biggest reasons people aren‚Äôt wearing masks US. Literally go TV, Twitter, whatever, think someone little bit, could saved lot lives. 

He American blood hands, people still going vote couple months. Sometimes, don‚Äôt understand people. said essential workers would still lockdowns, course, would depend continued labor essential workers, category estimate 35 percent workforce possibly less.

If one every three workers still job understand complete lockdown. That's data suppression. add, masks socially responsible thing Asia anytime sick didn‚Äôt begin Covid. Everyone including small kida learn put mask don‚Äôt feel well know reduces spread. It‚Äôs rocket science. never believed bullshit second. went bought protection family back February. masks reason less cases? physical distancing lock downs?

Correlation mean causation. kind like ""you get tell do! want fucking bartender!""

Especially person perceived ""beneath"" caste/class system. person perceived WAY line following orders. 

*See also: ""don't know am??!""* Agreed - many metrics crapping though. ICJ deals issues countries, ICC deals individuals. 

ICJ care leader country. there's correlation people racist people wear masks, mean racism leads wearing masks. implication we're going need keep wearing masks indefinitely, years, that's gonna me. I'm extremely mask-compliant right now. Absolutely, 100% going happen. mask coming day get vaccine. Thank standing people like this. everyone cared enough showed understanding wearing damn mask, we'd possibly jobs back now.

Instead higher deaths, less jobs, people depending government financial assistance (then lied extension dates comes) people suffering depression domestic issues. soon think Labor Day parties start showing spikes?  describe happened situation? Thanks. stock market!

:-/ Looks calendar. 3rd quarter 2020. Fuuuuuuuuuck. Wondering getting downvoted here, appears eminently sensible - accurate - viewpoint. save energy needed. Obviously twist words need cotton spin yarn, they'll fabricate whole cloth regardless. fully support vaccines. I've every vaccine offered me, get flu shot every year, kids get vaccines every recommended interval. However, feel like rushed think I'll waiting get COVID vaccine. see (roughly) five year process condensed year safe they're saying. 

I'm thinking back original HPV vaccine initially claimed safe, caused harm good.

If anyone explain process effective, I'm open listening. I've read articles, I'm still buying it. I'd love hear someone experience developing vaccines medical background.

*Edited autocorrect* get it, entire point seems COVID something needs battled individual level. Good luck philosophy, getting us nowhere fast.

Also 19 year olds fucking kids legally adults. seem like still undergrad understand think oh-so mature. someone worked higher ed, broad consensus treat undergrads like adolescents terms student life experience claim Fauci maliciously lies healthcare professionals access masks?

What if, conspiratorial scenario, someone made sure enough masks go around case pandemic? Like kind stockpile big, overarching organization country. Hmm. 

Lastly, make Trump nothing February, ‚Äúbanning‚Äù (but really) travel China? responsibility inaction, or? Lol ok, many. 

Guess teach statistics they? 

Wanna try less partisan hack? Spain too. effective measure avoid new lockdowns. 

Spain 281.6 cases per 100k last 14 days. Seems work well... I‚Äôve come learn people nonsensical, emotional reaction based vague ideas principles, it‚Äôs often actually something else. I'm mistaken, current consensus last forever; people eventually able get reinfected test positive again, due B-cells whatever get sick fact worse vast majority countries. 

You list excuses why, US also advantages many countries well. instance, less densely populated places done better, less stuff like mass-transit ridership. 

If add fact US done worse obvious ineptitude even counter-productive stuff White House done, pretty clear president failed us. was/is.

We approaching 200k Americans dead NY, got hit hard early, less 1/6 that. US handling terribly compared developed nations. FAKE NEWS.

The actual data released Swedish health ministry shows current 7-day rolling average 220 cases per day, go way back March 13 find days rolling 7-day average 110.

To claim 2020, we're learning masks prevent respiratory infection malicious misinformation. must posted 50 times already. Yeah guess wife high risk never leave house again. awesome life have. think trying lockdown one adhered ‚Äúgreatest mistake history‚Äù live weird fuckin life saying intentionally go way get COVID, I'm allowed criticize lockdowns? want socialize, party fun want go college. College learning, sponging people getting maximum enjoyment life living parents oppressive something. Yeesh. time reality catch entitled kids.

This. live US, masks had. separate offers four different colleagues China send masks. took couple it. time 100k 200k? Less month? Lol no. Stop overreacting. take mask there's nobody around, put back going inside, effectiveness still holds.

N95 cloth cloth remove sometimes (I.e. outside nobody 1.5m you) mask test too. Take look death graph, even infection graph country, graph find date country introduced mandatory masks. notice drop cases deaths would correspondent mandatory masks. 

For example, France introduced mandatory masks end August. Let‚Äôs see graphs

Cases (again, heavily influenced number masks exactly?

Do every country. 

Spain mandatory masks July. 

Let‚Äôs see deaths Double hmmmmm. Looks like concentration camps still exist already said applies asians well Yeah keep us hoarding health care workers fucked bad. waking around everywhere mask wasn‚Äôt hey don‚Äôt wear mask. 
But people can‚Äôt interpret read every word headlines point ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

I worked tizzy like you. exactly! logic led people say little gaps around sides masks, 100% useless. That's things work.

It would like saying dam open side channel lets water dam holding back water. Remember comment said waste? least 10 links alone.

Special point isn‚Äôt harm benefit. Tunevall‚Äôs study finding evidence suggesting harm (although possibility - **cannot** said masks increase infection without significantly research). don‚Äôt time write research paper every time post. 

As bacteria vs virus: masks don‚Äôt discernible impact transmission bacteria, bacteria massive relative viruses. method studies using examined see got different results. 

Yeah, that‚Äôs called systematic review. scientists pull research hypothesis, comb it, eliminate questionable studies (sometimes strict standards, like RCTs only), analyze different results methodologies, determine *totality evidence* supports. 

There MANY independent systematic reviews masks years. conclusion: masks proven work (no evidence effectiveness ‚Äúinconclusive‚Äù). Canadians Americans lol Question: heightened risk go public outdoor basketball court shoot around? I‚Äôd wear mask one basket (not playing pickup). I‚Äôd also make sure disinfect ball afterwards Yeah Ok lowers risk lot. Second this, Thai, Hong Kong, well, Asian country wearing mask long Covid (Often respitory relate sickness protect others.). 

I know lot Caucasian mask much. Whatever reason heard never make sense scientific fact backing up. (I half White/ Asian) American, French, Soviet Revolutions taught us must always *trust* **verify** comes government. know Canada, Texas I've part study antibodies, results weeks out. you‚Äôre afraid getting sick lock work home etc. I‚Äôm responsible health. want minority rights, especially greatest minority world, individual. You‚Äôre responsible you, I‚Äôm responsible Also, thought whole point supposedly perfect ""lockdown hard early, strict track trace"" policy life could return normal would little economic social downsides. Otherwise, what's point?

Life largely returned normal, sure point open, businesses open, sports allowed, public venues like museums/libraries/cinemas/restaurants/bars open. Beyond maximum size 10 people social gatherings, exactly normal? often need meet friends groups (and that's Auckland, 100 everywhere else) *actually* impede life? Seriously. can't even pass stimulus bill side would rather fuck pocketbooks working class people blame side it. USA serious institutional problems need addressed, lest country go way Roman Empire vaccine would distributed four phases, health-care workers, elderly people underlying health conditions getting vaccinated first, according group.¬†

Does anyone know underlying healthcare conditions phase one? published list? I'm willing bet quite lot money countries way, way, worse reporting Sweden. [severely restrict essential travel, food, supplies, medical personnel you. They're also fully empowered institute mandatory monitored quarantine.

edit: also say *closed*. said closed keep saying could found legal pretext **limit travel states**. anything expecting half. Side effects minor course. Hate say yep, that‚Äôs probably gonna happen. Anti-vaxxers fuck everyone. 
Masks mandatory Japan - Japanese government cannot make anything like that, never lockdowns Japan.

What ask people stay home, work home possible, avoid things groups, wear mask, wash hands that.

But enforcement, fines. asked.

People wearing masks Japan normally wide range reasons, hasn‚Äôt hard. lovely handmade masks coordinate like would pocket squares already big pile N95 (for emergencies) normal masks (for allergies, sniffles, dusty job site stuff) haven‚Äôt gone yet. Excuse what? sub regulararly celebrates others deaths... Well said.  counter this, would also encourage people read newspapers outside country get idea what's going on, countries countries. spread China Europe, matter time wound here.  


Read parts political spectrum whichever country. example, US, limit Fox News Washington Post. lot media political agenda, read widely better chance getting better information. happen. countrywide lockdown would final push widespread unrest. everything else 2020 would finally it. book. COVID fact deaths hospitalizations increasing South Dakota? mostly agree you, let's pretend that's sole reason masks become partisan. 

There's truly toxic bizarre death cult wants get back normal life badly willing manipulate everything else suit narrative. without WHO, want GDP stock market back normal, care people get sick die, let anything get way that. They'd attacking scientists public health officials regardless. One round statements masks effective create beast. also, NYS data, Rockland County , overall highest rate peak (and overall) persistent higher % positives. I‚Äôve come believe American stupidity contagious. Good luck Canada! Glad it‚Äôs  Basically saying prevention reliable good health outcomes treatment, think makes sense.

A vaccine preventative though, used treat covid  can‚Äôt agree wearing cares 
I can‚Äôt bother convincing lol paid partying spree. worked 4 years college. went 3-4 nights week incredible time met amazing people. Stop hard ass. kids lived parents 18 years, want socialize, party fun. Theres currently almost 50,000 students infected COVID surprise surprise...ZERO hospitalizations. I'm sorry fun college thats probably reddit lecturing people. also might find absurd smartest students also love party. kind comforting? last week less tests number infections 1500 something terrible leader USA killed USA cool, thanks Exactly! 

I sick mentality told explicitly something like wear mask distance don‚Äôt. Welcome adult. comes disappointments unfairness responsibility despite things - stop ‚Äúit‚Äôs ______‚Äôs fault‚Äù bullshit. probably excuse voice racism. while, cases started ramping US heard comments China. pretty horrified watch people unabashedly say something like think polarizing statement. They're probably still said, quietly bad got here. here. Even vaccines fail, I'm done then. saying I'll rush indoor concert tiny crowded bars, I'm talking like 95% normality. believe Fauci lied to, forced, threatened stand everyday march lie. 100% conspiracy man devoted life science helping people, come front nation lie... hard believe. Damn. always weddings. stance White House openly took responsibility back April governors adjusting responses asking help.

Now it‚Äôs 4+ months later White House finally decides take action.

My point making real time decisions best available information makes less responsible making real time decisions abdicating responsibility pushing states. That‚Äôs arm chair quarterbacking it‚Äôs pretty damn easy.

I didn‚Äôt move goal posts. don‚Äôt see difference taking decisive action Mar/Apr vs August, don‚Äôt know tell you.

And no, don‚Äôt think making funding available 6 months start pandemic anything pandering voters. stand fact made adjustments policy, I‚Äôll add caveat ‚Äúwhen actually mattered most‚Äù keep happy. started working home day Dr. Osterholm made appearance Joe Rogan (I listen Rogan anymore since he's trying downplay stuff like masks)

I can't imagine frustrating past 6 months medical experts like Dr. Osterholm, watching country absolutely reject basic science healthcare policy,  Let's forget Trudeau Hadju sticking progressive guns saying ""closing border slow virus""

These people lied put ideology you, country elected lead. assholes. like seriously. disgusting federal government PPE ready teachers start school year.

They time, money. cloth cloth remove sometimes mask

N95 cloth cloth remove sometimes mask

fyfi lol outbreak widespread lockdown necessary. reopen carefully according guidelines. entire US done this, wouldn‚Äôt mess now. 

In NYC strict lockdown lasted 2and1/2 months opened slowly phases. seems 6 weeks isn‚Äôt enough outbreak widespread. 

Also think New Zealand done best Western world. lie. understanding masks N95 block tiny particles. understand virus travels mouths water droplets.

Masks still protect wearer much viruses coming in; job protect OTHERS potential virus-laden breath.

Get facts straight leave sub, dude. presidents shut borders? Cuomo blames Trump shutting Italian United States border sooner. he's right course. People Melbourne 6 weeks 12 week minimum lockdown. lockdown provisions, people go outside 1 hour day exercise, can't go 5km home, one person per household buy groceries, non-essential businesses closed, arrested wearing mask, police enter homes without warrant, police arrest people [making Facebook posts organizing (a protest encouraged social distancing), [people arrested little venting. mom stuck cleaning people's teeth hygenist last month half. face shield n95 aerosol infested room. Yesterday gave everyone who's working teeth space suit (she works naval Base). PAPR 3m breath easy p3 cartridges, motorized filtration system. Looks like something apocalypse they're finally providing good protection relieved lot anxiety super immunocompromised working college aged naval people.   data cherry pick? studies show evidence benefit - that‚Äôs conclusion, conclusion many qualified researchers scientists performed independent systematic reviews evidence years. mention several years pics video citizens Asia wearing masks pollution, influenza outbreaks, SARS MERS. data points that? Good stuff. Thanks linking me. thought counting largely driven early lack testing US, seems like persistent supposed. think anyone happy all. genuinely put numbers context. blunt horrific sounds, people die day, everyday kinds reasons. april 5% population already anti bodies.

Source ? Speculating random people infer statement irrelevant disputing lie said masks work. speculation ass-pulled ""interpretations"" seem capable of, sad :( think matter comments belonging sub, instead article?

a lot commenters spitballing knowledge go words.

so article belongs here. skip comments exercise skepticism reading them. entire post OP frustrating, people acting like today's knowledge back February roasting WHO, Fauci healthcare community general understand know things know today. extreme monday morning quarterbacking.  There‚Äôs nothing rewrite. CDC Fauci specifically lied. Inexcusable Immune thought. point, without vaccine, need go back normal. Social Distancing light lockdowns destroying small businesses.

The messaging may need change high risk, isolate and, hell, government provide assistance people able to.

Expecting 300 million people destroy livelihoods mental health two-plus years reasonable ask fallout would worth it. I'm genuinly amazed, thought source refutes point. I'm college student netherlands I'm forced attend full days class person. professors want teach via teams anymore. Meanwhile prime minister complaining youth causing corona problems now, whilst previously insisting younger people sensitive covid unable spread it. stay inside responsible, whilst still forced sit 25 people basically classroom. personal assessment based looking nyc dashboard. affluent children w/ parents addicted FOXNEWS. paper towel? dude go Amazon. also disinfecting wipes Clorox brand name isn‚Äôt. part UN. government. leadership positions appointed committee political.  think underestimated sheer selfishness Americans lol bell tolls.

I almost forgive early mask statements. Almost.

What can't forgiven Pandemic Bond childishly tried protect claiming fucking pandemic. add another source, interestingly quite time gone now. something allegedly works doctors nurses somehow work you, confidence crisis brewing

The ""somehow"" proper use. Doctors/nurses expected follow guidance proper use general public can't. People mess masks kinds ways, leaving noses out, touching face/the mask frequently, re-wearing dirty masks, false sense security. Gloves still recommended general public COVID improper use, medical professionals sure hell using them.

N95 masks short supply needed hospitals, clear whether benefit cloth mask would outweigh extra face touching, especially people wearing right.

It's easy make criticism hindsight, would narrative different world cloth masks effective recommended anyway people got sick touching faces much? Towns different states. can't close travel states America.  Including bill Yep. I've taking vitamin C since March.

Amazing people need wait gold-stamped study try something simple cheap vitamin supplements. again, also took covid people acknowledge obese unhealthy. restrictions alert level 1/2 rather minor point one's daily life pretty much same. NZ actually, point, alert level 1/2 longer strict lock Oxford Policy Stringency Index developed rate strict controls social economic life different countries battling Covid-19. New Zealand's Level 4 lockdown rated 96.3 100 Level 3 83.33, Levels 2 1 much relaxed countries May 14, New Zealand moved Level 2, enjoyed freedoms Swedes. Even now, two-thirds population operates less strict environment Sweden. fact, since February 28, New Zealand reported first case Covid-19, spent time laxer measures Sweden IMF predicts Sweden's GDP fall 6.8 percent year increase 5.2 percent next. comparison, New Zealand's GDP expected fall 7.2 percent year rise 5.9 percent next - although projection made prior move Level 2 nationally Level 3 Auckland last Sweden rose 6.7 percent 9 percent year ended June. New Zealand, year-on-year unemployment flat 4 percent. April projection IMF estimates Sweden end year 10.1 percent unemployment, prior latest lockdown, New Zealand expected reach around 10 percent unemployment end September still suffering active lockdown, economy recession, outbreaks still happening:

Oh yeah, NZ totally still suffering. They're clearly suffering 'outbreaks' single digit cases (basically &lt;5 past 2 weeks). Also, country's economy recession?  That's called leader MAGA herd mentality can‚Äôt help read Robert Redford every time. Jesus Christ! Go Spain! stopped MF once, stop again! overestimated American‚Äôs ability politicize wearing one 
It mainly problem recognize lag guess. consistent problem Sweden. particular spring. example: 

At daily press conference April 7th, day Sweden‚Äôs deaths peaked 122, Anders Tegnell said following: 

‚ÄúWe average past week 40 deaths per day. usual working this, small decline see now, means possibly gone kind peak.‚Äù

The actual average past week 40 80,4. decline thought saw due lag reporting. Deaths peaked April 8th 122 didn‚Äôt go 90 April 21st. 

But time Authorities constantly presented numbers steep decline reality become clear weeks later. 

It would strange didn‚Äôt influence decision makers acted time. 

The problem continues reporting new cases. One two days ago Tegnell said Sweden, contrast rest Europe, decline. true. Cases going weeks now. 

For reference Nordic countries similar lag reporting. First, person replied specifically used fact surgeons wear masks surgery support effectiveness everyday mask use general population (they must work). Literally evidence suggests doctors wear masks evidence effective, it‚Äôs habit feels like really really work. openly acknowledged way medical professionals scientists (or months ago).

Second:

Mask mandates currently explained reasoning don‚Äôt protect wearer, protect everyone else wearer.

That EXACTLY studies test: surgeon wearing mask protect patient him?

The answer (or you‚Äôre feeling generous, ‚Äúinconclusive‚Äù).

Now studies surgeons, normal people daily life - different situations.

In operating theater, surgeons highly trained experienced implementing best sanitation practices (things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt touch mask‚Äù), wearing masks sterile environment limited time specific purpose. IDEAL mask circumstances: clean room surgeon uses masks properly.

And discernible impact (there even studies finding masks may increase infections).

So ‚Äúas close perfect get‚Äù environment, masks don‚Äôt proven benefit preventing transmission stuff (predominantly bacteria - important bc bacteria MASSIVE compared viruses) surgeon patient.

And you‚Äôd like studies specifically masks protect respiratory viral infections - plenty well, showing best ‚Äúinconclusive‚Äù results. Damn stupid American. Alright, ignore question know answer. That's entirely acccurate. 

COVID-19 attacks many organs viruses, flu, (probably seems vascular disease rather respiratory disease). likely person would long-term damage to, say, kidneys COVID-19 something like flu. Normally, I'd agree you, man family, including daughters, received death threats stating basic, common sense health Exactly right. don‚Äôt know one chief US doesn't, bum. around reasoning. Manny Vietnamese wearing masks back 90s. strange (I think) shows effective masks be. want new education get student visa. full degree canada automatically get post-graduate work visa makes easier get regular work visa stay Canada.  How'd even get there? thought countries letting Americans in? thought precautions? remember lmao what? Chinese water bottle helmets? describe microchips might work? would powered, example? Still takes week here, Louisville KY results r/iamatotalpieceofshit God, imagine public health policy says ""Guys, humans actually live longer without food think!"" get he's wealthy creating computer software guy become virus expert? bunch asshole spreaders. curious but, determine specifically pandemic?

20% new businesses fail first two years open, 45% first five years, 65% first 10 years. 

 determining it, say article Slovakia cases per 100k Sweden right now. N1000  infections occur 20-40 age group. would assume masks work fine there.

Sure know going we're wearing masks here, point was, government seems think work all. Damn RIP. 

Probably reach 1M Mar 2022 Cool, thanks advice. fucking way Yep. couple chronic illnesses. couple years ago still getting diagnosed one them, sick anything better part three months. energy keep head whole conversation. missed... everything. birthday parties, visits, nothing.

The pandemic hell lot better, least fun things. people, energy bake, garden, home improvement stuff. energy Skype grandparents, email friends, write letters. countries successfully contained returned normal like china vietnam. socialist post locked. 

No incivility conspiracy theories please easily google ""coronavirus long term effects"" also keep mind early still. let's roll accept claim. Ok pneumonia. ever pneumonia? takes weeks stop feeling like crap half-year get resemblance okay shape, maybe another half-year get back normal shape. 

Some us simply want take risk. maybe wondering give crap panicky people. Well, next time chat local small business owner (brewery, hairdresser, etc), ask question, they'll fill care. learn 6 months herd immunity means shit Would rather wear ventilator? (Or friends, family, etc.) Again, extreme cases. Feel free hide forever though. leaders need stop relying China, wherever possible, shit need leaders need stockpiles shit would need case emergency war 

 saving money vital health supplies shit national defense another long list disgraces society accepts, leaders failing protect us easily imagined situation would required tiny bit forethought given mask large enough Jay Leno, fit normal woman-sized face. Oh, kids received exact size. students 4. 50% people immune, see 20% population getting mitigation efforts.  Australia doesn‚Äôt funnily enough State Victoria does; rule laws breach benefit proportionate harms done, isn‚Äôt less harmful alternative. 

As someone legally trained lawyer think much probably turn illegal State Federal level Australia look forward watching litigation. Anyone invest stock market believe testing outside hospital settings May.   Yeah speculation chain lessened severity. Say catch masks, get mild version, contagious, transfer small amount virus next guy, mild, he's contagious, spreads small amount virus next guy, also mild, contagious, etc. line. 

This speculation point seems like could true. Tbh anyone believing lie kind dumb begin with. could thing covering orifices least inhibit illness spread bodily fluids exhaling. else people think spread disease? Everything else usually covered shits flying skin. Anyone brain knew lie day one. Even didn‚Äôt protect you, everyone wore one, obviously would slow spread across board since without symptoms would also wearing one. Common sense, apparently people don‚Äôt have. That's said They're part emergency kits Asia since protect dust emergency kits thought protect earthquakes. stole earthquake kit masks disinfectants shops anymore! flu shot free US every season.

That‚Äôs I‚Äôm arguing against. Maybe spends billion research. debate still had.

Because ""Sweden bad"" crowd learn? 

Noone saying Sweden things perfectly. firstly, add Belgium Netherlands figure well Sweden longer unique worst. always seem get conveniently forgotten comparisons ""Sweden bad"" crowd. Funny article talks cherrypicking stats. 

Basically, debate continue ""Sweden bad"" crowd learn differentiate *bad circumstances/events* *bad strategy*. Noone denying bad events happened Sweden. virus got old age homes. Like many places death toll high. Belgium worse. stricter restrictions. logic, stricter restriction strategies failed cause worst? (or may bad circumstances/events). 

If Swedish strategy inherently bad, current rates/spread would low moment increase Europe. yeah, debate goes learn (and also international media stop inaccurately reporting Swedish strategy).

The bad circumstances/events exist different reasons fault absolutely found (but fault strategy). E.g. authorities probably acted slow initially. criticism also aimed UK (also worse) Netherlands (about equally bad) (I remember Belgium). maybe high death rates seems occur countries acted little sluggish implementing *any measures*? problem Swedish strategy, problem initial response. can't know that.  insane many people praise China defend them, even slightest criticism. It‚Äôs newspaper, based moscow since 1990s. Fact remains though US, average 20-80k people die flu year average. Covid deaths passed 200k year alone. So, based you‚Äôre saying, it‚Äôs quite bit deadly common flu former former corona viruses combined, isn‚Äôt it? crazy article linked. really rings true. depressing that.... Never would threaten status quo. Moscow Times ‚Äúpropaganda arm?‚Äù hope kind attempt humour, otherwise way you‚Äôd come conclusion general, blinding prejudice. laundromats near shuttered. shocked. study excuse inaction. care spread. think anything spreading first place. Non-maskers hopelessly stupid need forced compliance. forced hard enough far I'm concerned. really herd immunity immune months? Length immunity still unknown, right?

So... shit one hand pray see one fills first.

Edit: scientists know problem, concerned.  public knowledge, come around. Luckily I‚Äôm Canada. much better perfect.

Holy shit. democracy decaying fascist dictatorship. sounds like you‚Äôre pretty fortunate situation. plenty teachers tighter budgets. didnt give live NY. want anything, need mask Sadly, America. want mindset change slightly, vote better system. want something revolutionary, going couple years change happens, all. 

Best bet move another country cares family. That's plan least. easy, I'd take whatever shithole. citizens afraid neighbors. Police uncooperative? Vaccines induce higher response less likely effected issue. Literally article... time people accept 2 things:

1) virus going infect large amount people matter do. spread even delay going burn vaccine.

2) Masks far less effective people think real world. Louisiana, California, Hawaii, Spain, etc mad masks months.....their cases rose anyway. Georiga Sweden masks virus retreating.

Correlation causation. No... anything cool like, looking citizens. wish.

We paid everyone 6 dollars day asked pray good health.

What meant, probably say correctly aiming herd immunity, intentionally not, that's did.

I'm convinced achieve herd immunity coronavirus... again, maybe can. 

If herd immunity even possible.... We're first place... not... well, killed people nothing. underestimated it. I've wearing mask since said asymptomatic people could spread it. Coughing sneezing symptoms. Thanks reddit, bought package surgical masks February 5‚Ç¨ people Europe even knew happening China.

Some friends (who tried warn) even laughed cause paranoid.

Now already told right... realise vaccines typically induce stronger immune response counter unusual problem. means got covid potentially trouble, vaccination solution. He‚Äôs ‚Äúmedical leave‚Äù now. I‚Äôm asking people behave certain way benefit greatest amount people. Good god it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm taking pigeon. understand people say wearing mask removes freedom. Yet they'll wear shoes protect feet, gloves protect hands clothes protect bodies. 

Why wearing mask protect organs cross line? lockdown mistake. SHOW NATURAL MUTATION PATH.

How? It‚Äôs like samples intermediate viruses SARS-COV-2 it‚Äôs closest relatives. said asymptomatic people could spread automatically assumed airborne then. Coughing sneezing symptoms. asymptomatic people spreading it? Airborne. gave mom anal flu once. caused rest world take greater impact took capable conducting effective lockdown comparison everyone else. saying true would effective way tanking countries economies little damage  Yes, might also include reason filibustered. filibustered included lawsuit protections employers covid-19 related lawsuits. basically free pass ignore worker safety. work zone, idiots managers down. ‚ÄúNo worse cold‚Äù. 12 deaths reported yesterday 960 new infections masks here.

Neither proven way really fair compare Italy activity trying kill citizens. made claim actually. every link someone provides shown prevalence common pneumonia related diseases.

And aspirations, clearly dont. Instead sitting ass last months I‚Äôve built home gym gone multiple backpacking trips. fact can‚Äôt go eat restaurant silly beyond belief. young mid 20s fit person like danger getting flu ""I want engage discussion im going keep replying think getting last word means tell block me, even though want engage discussion.""

Good happening schools businesses already reopened. mean tell way walk, I'm womans man, time talk Actually cotton masks work bit too. Studies shown measurable filtration effect. Take hypothetical example person behind sneezing super market. results something like: mask breathe 1000 virus particles, N95 breathe 50 virus particles, blue surgical mask breathe 200 virus particles, cotton mask breathe 400 virus particles, polyester breathe 700 virus particles. way slice it, wearing mask cut initial virus entry, therefore allow time body respond mount defense. Speaking personal experience: seemed well understood area (A) N-95 masks even available ethically obtainable cloth masks would (B) KNOW RIGHTS!

It already exists. [No need photoshop, I've seen memes thing well. already know it‚Äôs like able get enough air in: getting Covid scares shit me.

i theory shitheads running around without masks people never really sick, least never really sick respiratory illness.... 

anyone survived severe respiratory illness (myself included) knows getting covid avoided costs....    feel like 28-30 really prime. Young hopefully slightly established career then. Pot...kettle Fauci clear beginning pandemic could get serious.

Wrong. would thought shutting economy would result... masked back February. super vigilant never aware many things hands try touch day.

Still ended Hospital. Six months later, _think_ I'm finally back old self.

I'm young, healthy, took health advice seriously. They're many countries. get thrown jail disobey lockdowns. ...isn‚Äôt case furloughed employees cannot work? Heart disease cancer deaths 800,000. confirmed. What‚Äôs worse WHO, US, others spreading little white mask lie, mask already gone.  Either people family Asia bought shipped back personal use profit, Chinese government sent folks buy everything could ship back. 

I part multiple projects ship warehouses worth supplies China air charter.  cleared available PPE medics supply inventory North America end Feb.

So whole lie nothing end. Lol, Russia China far worse. Lol it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs saying you‚Äôd don‚Äôt care actions going hurt people. You‚Äôre selfish. time good time, sooner better later Brah, CDC said 6,000 deaths Covid.


....can really mark /s TRUE though?  interesting. Thank you!  following health codes guidance state like now. Dude, chill. I'm agreeing reason taking personally.


I‚Äôm, Im upset don‚Äôt care think agreeing me, makes statements evolution less addressing analogy presented show differs scope complexity situation

Link, please thank you! dark deserves meme, complete photo crudely stitched face-mask-face. That's confusing introvert anti-social. I'm introvert meaning around people takes energy need time recharge. mean enjoy around people. anything, US lot rural areas low density population complaining covid city problem there's virus near them, rates go vertical late.

Where happened? I've seen rural ""hot spots"", far places America hospitals overwhelmed cities. ""Rural hospitals gonna get overwhelmed!"" carries much weight ""just two weeks we'll sorry!"" mean hypothetical scenarios. think gotta stop listening anybody isn‚Äôt Fauci. compromised it‚Äôs coming Trump. That‚Äôs pressure misinformation coming from. mean regardless happens don‚Äôt listen says. said testing Spain got control strict lockdown, unsustainable long term. However, clearly figured sustainable alternative open economy without seeing another severe outbreak. California actually lessons. California seen big reductions infection rate since mid July instituting universal mask mandate targeted closures certain indoor activities. California botched first round, since figured live virus.

Believe want thing. definitely going put damper social life many months come, mention hospital stay going least month okay. like Covid patients, gets visits family he's there. got tablet watch movies got sent hospital. He's extroverted too, particularly hard him. try text video chat can, he's it.

Truthfully I'm worried today texted back 20 hours. He's high dose oxygen, there's go intubation. 

Believe someone know gets sick ends hospital going say movie worth it. fun things take risks worth it. 

I see family lot I'm extroverted too. try meet friends outside. Go walks, drink patio. winter hard, dude disease disgusting. safe. Think friend ICU family him. horrible. said day, widely panned downvoted sub. /r/enoughcommiespam  cannot upvote enough. current government actively trying kill inaction. blood gore theatrics planes smashing buildings. flatter numbnuts. understood anything disease would absolutely understand increases risk death pneumonia. doubt could teach rock sit still. case college worries people even class even seem care people wearing bandanas essentially one layer cut fabric mask keep touching masks day concerns greatly proper masks enforced personally don‚Äôt understand need much antibodies. mean antibodies highly specific, designed high affinity target. shouldn‚Äôt need much.

Which start asking questions like hell thing body? going attaching virus like would think something else that‚Äôs crazy that‚Äôs need gram (!) amounts it. mean 3 grams antibody. factor additives everything fucking put bowl eat like cereal. INB4 tHeReS cHiPs MaSkS banned cars completely, traffic fatalities would go 0. that? banned sugary processed foods, heart disease rate would drop precipitously. that? banned alcohol, would save countless lives well. want hear contagious. That's point I'm making. I'm speaking abstract concept valuing lives freedom saving every life possibly can. things, fatalities country would drop tremendously. favor changing laws save lives? guess no, balance freedoms along safety. That's point he's making. contagious. lengths go ""save every life.""  Absolutely. countries already that?

Edit: typos repeatedly lied maybe could hold every three weeks timetable gets thrown back three months. I'm done jerked around. I'm setting boundary that's that.

With mental health way is, know make another full year hey, get depressed kill myself, least COVID right? Well hunker till April lot jobs gone. least people lot free time next summer. people free make choice. need demand anything lockdown ""two weeks flatten curve,"" ""an indeterminate amount time eliminate transmission virus.""

And right America's giant mistake. took 7 weeks extremely strict lockdown us eliminate virus completely NZ. case 3 months that. came back took 3 weeks strict lockdown contain back 0 cases day. Elimination way live normal life Covid-times. people get locked beliefs unwilling accept new information. thing told six months ago true believed then, you‚Äôre telling something different?

Yep, understand this. antithetical Science whole. People thread demonstrating exactly Fauci **DIDN'T.** Fauci able course-correct better, reliable information **novel** Coronavirus. 

It's unfortunate navigate PPE shortage midst it. Honestly? Yeah. Americans always selfish, costs us way lives usual. everyone masked, relatively low chance catching spreading COVID-19, case, chance already minimal. worried unless come flu symptoms and/or happen get test curiosity comes back positive. says expected governments cover costs... vaccine bust safe distribute public? governments going reimbursing AstraZeneca?

The question sacrifices people make order reduce transmission question ethics, question medical expertise. single infusion experimental drug markedly reduced levels coronavirus newly infected patients lowered chances would need hospitalization, drug‚Äôs maker announced Wednesday.

The drug monoclonal antibody, manufactured copy antibody produced patient recovered Covid-19, illness caused coronavirus. Many scientists hope monoclonal antibodies prove powerful treatments Covid-19, difficult expensive manufacture, progress slow.

The announcement, Eli Lilly, accompanied detailed data; independent scientists yet reviewed results, published peer-reviewed journal. findings interim results ongoing trial.

More 450 newly diagnosed patients received monoclonal antibody placebo infusion. 1.7 percent got drug hospitalized, compared 6 percent received placebo ‚Äî 72 percent reduction risk, Eli Lilly reported.

Levels coronavirus plummeted among participants received drug, symptoms fewer, compared got placebo.

The treatments far shown help coronavirus patients ‚Äî antiviral drug remdesivir steroid dexamethasone ‚Äî intended hospitalized patients. mild moderate disease wait hope best.

Dr. Myron Cohen, director Institute Global Health Infectious Diseases University North Carolina Chapel Hill, said impressed. clinical trial appears rigorous, results ‚Äúreally compelling.‚Äù
Other companies, too, developing monoclonal antibodies combat coronavirus, noted: ‚ÄúThis opening door.‚Äù
Dr. Rajesh T. Gandhi, infectious disease specialist Massachusetts General Hospital, applauded Eli Lilly studying people mild moderate disease. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs 80 percent patients are,‚Äù said.

Dr. Gandhi said encouraging drug seemed lowered amounts virus respiratory tract, said might mean patients could made less infectious. would difficult demonstrate, requiring enormous trials, added.
While data far ‚Äútantalizing,‚Äù Dr. Gandhi said, wanted detail anticipated completion study, include patients.
Monoclonal antibodies used treat diseases cancer arthritis eczema. expensive extremely difficult manufacture.
To make monoclonal antibody, researchers Eli Lilly gathered blood plasma people survived infections coronavirus, retrieving testing thousands antibodies plasma find ones seemed powerful.
Next scientists determined antibody‚Äôs genetic sequence inserted DNA sequence E. coli bacteria, turning tiny antibody factories. bacteria grown huge stainless steel vats aseptic conditions sterile room; bacterial soup must constantly monitored ensure contaminated microbes.
Once vat teeming bacteria brimming antibodies, workers remove soup concentrate antibodies use drug. ship new drug plant packaging labeling, maintaining aseptic conditions keeping antibodies chilled.
The process takes two four weeks. high cost monoclonal antibody results conditions must maintained make large quantities safely, Dr. Adams said.
The study eventually enroll 800 patients ages risk categories sites across United States. far research proceeded unusual speed.
Working feverishly, researchers Eli Lilly needed six months isolating antibody enrolling first patients June 17.
‚ÄúIt all-out effort,‚Äù said Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, company‚Äôs chief scientific officer.
Eli Lilly also testing drug nursing homes see prevents infections residents staff members.
In addition constantly measuring amount coronavirus blood, investigators also sought understand whether pathogen mutating avoid antibodies.
They found virus changing, extent: 8 percent viruses mutated participants getting drug, compared 6 percent receiving placebo. (Presumably, virus also trying dodge natural antibodies placebo patients making own.)
The investigators expected drug might produce reduction amount virus patients‚Äô nasal passages. anticipate sharp reduction patients needed hospitalization.

‚ÄúThis first time ever seen anything magnitude,‚Äù Dr. Skovronsky said.

The antibody drug produce significant side effects, said. Patients received single infusion, providing antibodies last month.

There good news regarding vaccine findings. monoclonal antibodies worked, finding may cast doubt notion virus could stopped antibodies.

On hand, results ‚Äî proven accurate ‚Äî guarantee vaccine work. Eli Lilly‚Äôs monoclonal antibody temporary treatment; vaccine designed elicit long-lasting natural antibodies thus immunity.

Like companies, Eli Lilly manufacturing large quantities drug ‚Äî 100,000 doses ‚Äî hope turns effective.

The company discussing data Food Drug Administration, Dr. Skovronsky said, along possibility obtaining emergency use authorization allowing Eli Lilly market drug.

If findings hold up, comfort public knowing something doctors head dire illness, Dr. Cohen said.

There's lot us contemplating major change locale. played plague inc., like headlines game different president would told maskless Karens stop bunch whiny crybabies put damn masks already stop initial spread. Even ironic remember American Somoa single case Spanish flu governor closed borders kept closed throughout pandemic. 

And sickening considering [NZ] blunder caused Samoa's outbreak bad. NZ governor angry American Samoa closing border telling conduct basic quarantine methods....

Not finest moment NZ's history...  surprised pandemic lasted 6 months stopped...

Spring happen April/May 2021, giving us another 4 months, another 100,000 potential deaths. Assuming election goes well we'll finally leader cares disease starts fixing country, expect another 25k-100k rest 2021.

Source: Turned 26 two months ago carrier hand hand, longer contagious aerosol. Well cdc fucked lied waffled flip flopped masks well medical folks knew truth agree pointing duties president protect citizens I‚Äôm literally interested either candidate may vote third party. that‚Äôs besides point. virus still rampaging don‚Äôt see end sight time point cdc pretty close deaths though say 200k 400k Jan 1st think true I'm still mad this. read CDC putting out. said masks reduce spread like 3% (or stupid low number quote exactly I'd find articles). Reputable sources time saying fabric masks work. 

I mask denier. wear (even kindergarten age kid). month March April things read said stay home. leave house. spent whole summer home. We're spending fall home. School work done home (I'm exhausted). Frankly overwhelming. 

Now much time home starting outside things (with masks) something. starting incorporate low risk things lives adequate safety precaution I'm quite frankly losing mind.

My father law passed decided go funeral last week (it decision made lightly). things go 2020, person sat behind services later found covid (she's teacher). first covid exposure. also next table lunch. wore masks. lunch tables 6 feet apart. hug close family, kept short minimal. Lots precautions taken.

We got test sure, luckily catch covid. Now, I'm going start heading bars restaurants time soon, really wish need masks would advised beginning. year would little easier could half normal life lots safety precautions instead avoiding everything months months. 

For reference, live U.S. south. state slow mask mandate. stay home safely avoid anti-maskers (there many here!). know places mandated masks sooner people may positive experience. I'm tired. Thank you!!! Yeah, general Canadians rule followers Americans rebels (look far back birth countries, ""Fuck land mine"" vs ""hey, mind letting us self govern?""). Sometimes American nature awesome entrepreneurial spirit progress, sometimes bites ass. colleges, mostly. every one pretends put students first. of. China welded people apartments 3-4 weeks reopened. ""social distanced"" locked businesses 4 months expected virus disappear. told people stock 3 weeks food shut everything down, masked everyone shut anything saved economy. completely unnecessary too. February cases known internationally slightest bit chatter N95, went Home Depot thinking I'd get pack. use sanding anyway needed regardless. already sold out, never stock since. Home Depot probably sells minuscule fraction N95s made mostly hospital product. telling people use save hospitals outlandish begin with, went completely overboard suggest even wearing try prevent people stockpiling. time, seemed silly suggest sewing masks, bother making suggestion far late. wrong. places closing Boston existed 30-40 years never empty. Shutting indefinitely actively killed them. So...it isnt anything close UBI think applying quarantine requirements interstate travel inter-provincial travel, especially earlier, much restrictive ones, probably would led revolt. Canadians like seem different outlook community responsibility holding peers account behavior damaging greater good.  honest liar trump get slightly honest answers basically best hope for. 

I still take everything says grain salt (as everyone should). Fool type deal

Edit: Also honest politicians. Anyone thinks either US political party great even passable job wasn‚Äôt paying attention. going debate either party think government showed failure top bottom. Especially beginning. ""I actually up-played it."" everything race ffs. don‚Äôt even think anti-maskers even aware mask usage Asia. seen statistic, would mind linking citation? Upvote think Soriot NEVER read letter. 

I understand open letters. I'd real curious know many read intended recipients.

Also, author's priorities author thinks Soriots priorities be... bearing Soriot's priorities, CEO, actually are, returning value shareholder investment. agree. school, University Colorado, found 308 cases far, 205 last week. Meaning 1% normal student population symptomatic covid contact someone tested positive (what need qualify tests). apparently NONE cases traced in-person classes. makes sense. Mask use strictly enforced cute little flags mark seats sit maintain appropriate distance, looks like 8 feet 6. Meanwhile lots cases traced sororities fraternities. gotten downvoted lot saying blame go students schools, think testing certainly could whole lot better, real problem irresponsible, partying kids account disproportionate share infections.

Now city Boulder imposed lockdown us students specifically, meaning can‚Äôt socialize can‚Äôt leave campus except go grocery shopping medical appointments. know way enforce this, hurts us made hard choice skip social activities. really fucked vaccine free.

Going get cost 200. know... bullshit. northeast hit like Europe. think clone accounts? Wow really paranoid. interest clones? rage face Coachella? person replying directly thread Trudeau saying ""I need get tested since symptoms"", wife positive.

So he's agreeing Trudeau symptoms need get tested, even though spouse positive. take it? left believe vaccine, right believe virus. lmao putting entire population indefinite house arrest [somehow normal expect people spend jobs, health, health insurance, retirement accounts risk? know I'm going high risk environment prolonged period time want protection beyond usual cloth mask. people social, social distancing feels like lockdown. able attend university person killing me.

It also would great call action people beginning stages everyone feeling powerless helpless. ""The great mask drive!"" anyone sewing machine spare fabric could make masks people. Create organization accept donations distribute (after sanitizing/QA). Create approved patterns materials use, etc. Spot on, except public transport Paris heavily air-conditioned! Source: I'm inside rn article states \~ ""Our **#1 priority protect** health safety Canadians""..yet, photo they're wearing masks &amp; standing close together (**pensive** ?? )üò∑ I‚Äôm assuming means everything normal. Like packed stadiums football concerts. I‚Äôm betting Memorial Day next year almost everything normal (open bars/restaurants,travel resuming, open offices etc) restrictions mass events like still place. research done far side moon. still don‚Äôt know people believed lie. Clearly stopping droplets entering air reduce spread. Ugh much hassle. would rather let fun something pointless. end, common thing internet. I‚Äôm American narrative comes US politics. remove political comments reported. Please report feel violate sub rules mods address them.  We're going locked year. people get vaccinated, spread slow things open. spread slows, people start feeling comfortable old routine. importantly, normal life also includes travel people, something people hesitate spread happening areas.

Lockdowns nothing. 

In short, saying we'll back normal year actually amazing. pretty much saying believe herd immunity vaccine year. took bit longer become furious...

I went self quarantine March 14. spent next three months begging people mask distance. June furious, told every variance BS: ""masks work"", ""I medically exempt"", ""it's ***only*** 1% death rate"", ""you I'll me"", time ***favorite*** --- ""if afraid stay home"". Many friends family members despite knowing medical issues, 5 year old grandson's medical issues, mother's medical issues, made clear give damn anyone. point quit asking nicely took offense. remove many people life stay semi-sane. Even 6 months scientific data generated far numbers still climbing still believe I'm even furious. small circle everything fight virus yet forced continue shelter place ones refuse anything get continue going around infecting everyone. actual mandates, strong suggestions. Low paid essential workers literally risking lives provide food, etc. yelled at, beaten even killed asking customers mask. Yeah, I'm long past tipping point initial fears end sight maybe end 2021 might actually realistic. I'm honestly sure make long. sucks think pretty realistic timeline. conspiracy theory pushers/believers age mass social media threat civilization. Tinfoil dude's head tighter Trump's - even sounds like one diatribes. Difference Trump president.

Never forget, HUGE numbers, 15 MILLION DEAD. flip side, people believe US engineered virus introduced China. Even though wreaking way havoc US China. laughed people said good. said, doctors nurses work patients? literally lockdown obviously getting go school see professors friends plus myriad things make life worth living might well lockdown. Maybe try non-dairy substitute? heard Ben &amp; Gerry‚Äôs good non-dairy ice cream. ice cream isn‚Äôt worth gastrointestinal side effects. amount russophobia subreddit disgusting still remember jan/feb, vast majority reddit hivemind consensus asians stupid wearing masks b/c protect airborne diseases. 

i ALMOST convinced intelligent-sounding comments upvoted way top really opened eyes dangers reddit.

the thing fb/twitter naturally exposed much crap time take lot things seriously. 

but reddit, b/c voting system, easy take lot highly-upvoted comments seriously due groupthink. mention, there's type vernacular grammar-style that's conducive ending upvotes style naturally sounds intelligent informed.

but longer i've site, i've realized there's quite lot misinformation even among highly upvoted posts/comments. quite frightening really. 

reddit used considered place get authentic news/info that's available MSM way, veneer authenticity gives reddit possibility even dangerous simply consuming MSM. blaming. couple's choice wedding despite disease caused deaths 7 people. That's fact get live now.

We want people say ""I want publicly shamed media wedding kills someone, I'm cancelling it."" want say ""I want wedding kill anyone, I'm cancelling it."" bill gates coming woodwork virus? care opinion? Lower population sure. im contract tracer texas. entire program fucking joke. massive grift.  $300 million spent contract can't even get software working well enough tracers even jobs.

I can't complain free money never seen fraud waste abuse government contract. CDC also said better testing offer.

CDC also said asymptomatic transmission.

CDC also said need test unless symptoms.

Fact is, CDC clue. ""enough dose vaccine"" solve problem vaccine's efficacy safety. LOL - still year away. still large populations don‚Äôt trust vaccine won‚Äôt trust one due timing general lack trust leadership surrounding covid information.  *overestimated* value masks

Ftfy, liar psychopath Gates. mention people lied continue lied censored you, Fauci, various powers - especially techno fascists. They've programmed see people ""force"" wear masks enemy. They're entrenched deep state conspiracies believe half world get them. actually legend, classic 1954 Matheson Legend 1954 post-apocalyptic horror novel American writer Richard Matheson influential modern development zombie vampire literature popularizing concept worldwide apocalypse due disease. novel success adapted films Last Man Earth (1964), Omega Man (1971), Legend (2007). also inspiration behind Night Living Dead (1968).

It's much better movies. told us worthless beginning. I've worn one public since April, never believed :D know 5 governors sent infected elderly back musing homes killed many people own. Let's ignore lockdowns keeping kids little pods long-term effects well.  People can‚Äôt take joke. Data Gud doh socially isolated work remotely can‚Äôt get coronavirus that‚Äôs value network CDC WHO, leaders medical community pandemic, ones intentionally lied masks. yet paragraph rant Trump. know it‚Äôs hard comprehend, really think things outside single person. people mentality admitting Chinese people could right thing. Director Chinese CDC literally tell *Science* ""not wearing mask U.S/Europe big beside point. premise relies misinterpretation rule. post removed breaking rule indicated. What's impulse getting aggressive someone asks wear mask? twisted perceived insult? Asking honestly, understand what's going anymore. Who‚Äôs talking nothing here? It‚Äôs you.  You‚Äôre never going disprove way can‚Äôt disprove bush 9/11. genomic analysis heavily favours virus come naturally evolved offshoot animal governor spoke state needing better protecting people, even prisoners states, deserve human decency safe prisons. breakout prison LA, believe. sure actions taking statement though. endless amount literature regarding correlation vitamin deficiency poor covid outcome.

GDP collapse could well beginning greater economic downturn. Fuck Bill Gates I'm still trying figure school means sending kids deaths, around live, kids hanging groups months without masks.  Worse science fiction, good probably worth watching. 

Who wants watch movie success sitting around nothing people survive, cant anything months. I've realized majority people subs like r/politics kids. first like ""people acting like real world."" confused attitude subs completely different real world. realized really talk bunch kids everyday life. also realize another large portion users bots subs. know reddit actively trying push chosen narrative too. things seem weird places like this. bunch normal people posting too. comments get buried. People see comments. downvoted. honestly wish would get rid downvote system. let people upvote. would make interesting conversation would get many new viewpoints. course never happen though. powers want certain message getting out. look billboards talking upvotes reddit presidential election. Reddit agenda push tools it. makes things way boring. Still waiting numbers go zero like miracle... Ok that‚Äôs person saying lol. said aren‚Äôt showing symptoms don‚Äôt need test, said nothing contact people. disagree? That's true. never commented travel ban China way. earlier comments travel ban Muslim majority countries misconstrued talking travel ban China. Good way solve pension crisis housing crisis too! Well fuck... knows nothing, he's college dropout. medical background degree... part due virus really continuation secular trends. number movie tickets sold LY early 1990s 80 million fewer Americans. saying know definitively created lab? 

Or saying there's active debate topic? Honestly, without effective aid small businesses federal level, survival fittest. Spread already increasing town, I'm barely takeout again.

You open up, can't make people go dine. winter bad, amount easing restrictions save businesses.

There's things expand window outdoor seating, like stand heaters, restaurants near already done, but, that, gotta either nest egg good takeout plan keep going. beer, forget beer. Owen Schmitt. WV thanks that. fact needs separated parsed journalists failure public policy. It‚Äôs double speak people won‚Äôt come say something fear proven wrong later.  

Just call like know it, stupid word games die. NYC see reported 4627 deaths COVID, even test see it. kind reporting going cities could 10s thousands deaths nothing COVID. I'm trying say US bad compared places like Germany, bad reported. mean submission primarily pandemic outbreak. article primarily fact big ten resume playing football. 

Further, allowing posts like above, removing many directly related pandemic effects addressed shows clear inconsistency way rules enforced. happened quite individuals now. would necessarily consider coincidental, possibility.  true. Awesome movies thread title ""US passes 200,000 covid-19 deaths. jumping throat, mate? idea never wrong ‚Äúflip flop‚Äù comes politics extremely dangerous way view science - re-evaluating position based new information. You‚Äôve got think republican perspective‚Äî healthcare less expensive you‚Äôre dead die quickly! Thanks Bill Gates. yeah lie know it. already matter, entered new age. Things changing, many large businesses existed 80 years gone now. right course, U.S. far removed logic point can't play ""they could saved *X* lives game. Americans *still* convinced yes, locking would saved lives money. chance.   one wants fucking hear actual data. data indicates that, surprise, opened up, hotspots initial wave clear.

Florida open months. Hospitalizations lowest level since march. CLI record lows. 

We need lock again. *serious* *extreme* economic constitutional consequences lockdown. one sub seems give flying fuck secondary effects countervailing hypotheses.

Meanwhile, Miami-Dade county still *under curfew.* possible fucking justification daily curfew, going ELEVEN WEEKS NOW? fuck protect anyone? Ok, articular says 392,000 cases, 121 youth 21 died. math wiz correct wrong. would mean apx 300 cases per million death rate. US per million death rate right around 600. kids country like country, would 22nd highest death rate (Worldmeter).
True maybe half adult. 74 million kids USA, contract it, still could high number deaths. 
While original response knee jerk, loved one longer you, something could prevented accurate information beginning, extremely emotional almost feels like sucker punch. it‚Äôs suppose go? Finally. Thank you. underestimated value education critical thinking skills come it. Someone know got first TDaP booster last week lymph nodes start retaining water.  rare happens. freaked gained 5 lbs overnight left underarm supposedly looked like Jabba Hutt. Trudeau said need test symptoms isolating wife. 
 
Edit: say good idea, clearing facts. seems Trudeau could become infected tail end wife's isolation become asymptomatic spreader. enough testing capacity test symptomatic carriers though (if case time, often early days - least US) everything's pretty fucked anyway seems like lose-lose situation. ""There data suggest masks work prevent spread Covid1-19""

This phrased, deliberately, average person realize absence evidence evidence absence. People charge don‚Äôt listen experts. obvious economy needs virus control- it‚Äôs not. Canadians keep permenantly closed trade Europe. Seriously, US virus right now. Keeps us away cost. Though could see something mailing us weed. want moonrocks. Otherwise, keep us are. can't quaratine, wear masks, social distance LITERALLY save lives. 30% country says getting vaccine even proven safe. failed state poisons everything touch. didn't. Dr. Amy Acton, Ohio's former top health official, showed us make cloth table napkins rubber bands safety pins back March. started immediately always wore public could purchase proper masks. probably looked ridiculous matter me. Buddy, gave means find objective evidence matter already. going ignore simple, 3-minute process, there's point anyone entertaining baseless claims.

You clearly care reality here, looking talking points support fragile political ideologies. point trying make? helping bolster argument.

Not all. Diabetes condition relatively easy maintain ensure optimal health. Meaning someone diabetes dropping dead diabetes. They'd healthy diabetes controlled, die due covid, actually virus diabetes.

Someone diabetic inherently unhealthy. That's point. Get ready Depression study looks transmission students school found low precautions. finding apply regardless degree community spread. agree, help understand different levels community spread would somehow change transmission rate one infected student non-infected students?

So study help inform policy around school openings areas. study subject, data point. takeaway following German precautions raise tolerable threshold community spread without causing massive student-to-student outbreaks. taken context many data points risks. Alright, think need clarify mods work. don‚Äôt usually read entire threads instead get notifications reported comments/posts. review comments see warrant removal approval. yeah, happens remove comments miss similar comments due fact never reported never see them. Please help us better report comment/post break sub rules. record statements. ‚ÄúWestern country‚Äù.

Trust me, I'll take chances covid starving streets. Life sucks sometimes ya keep moving. NC, I've noticed people decided move on. Wear mask try stay away people. do.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Nobody thinks that. Also that's necessary get infected. Fauci knew CDC. intentional prevent shortages. argue reasoning facts intention damage.  think IFR would exceed 0.2 ""let run through"" due lack medical services? important treatment simply oxygen resource becomes available IFR increases, yeah? Private companies whatever want. Public spaces ""request"" wear mask. can't fined arrested whatever refuse wear mask public. Population density maps/graphs anything look like population density maps/graphs. Per capita next best metric. think major social media firms declared part public square making first amendment rights applicable.

I disagree taking away freedom rights like that, guess we'll agree disagree that.

As rest, declaring bar high possible convince reasonable time frame would still necessitate lockdowns even true. 

You setting situation preferred outcome happens even deadly wrong.

[Contrary idea trade-off, see countries suffered severe economic downturns ‚Äì like Peru, Spain UK ‚Äì generally among countries highest COVID-19 death rate. reverse also true: countries economic impact modest ‚Äì like Taiwan, South Korea, Lithuania ‚Äì also managed keep death rate That's bulk userbase subreddit, so... fucking work anyway. Whenever someone says panic, time panic. everyone knows facing massive problem it‚Äôs much better 50 uncoordinated separate plans opposed one unified coordinated plan. That‚Äôs glass 2.7% full thinking wish had. me, it‚Äôs 97.3% empty. 

But hope you‚Äôre right. don‚Äôt like flair gets saturated stuff mostly gets hopes up. Beast mental gymnastics! That's happen. they're wrong, they're wrong. debate normal healthy, let happen. 

Today physicists talk alternate timelines, living simulations, universe splits every time wave function collapses, fanciful nobody accuses anti-scientific. scientists supposed test, observe, collect evidence try disprove possible. 

That ok somehow, free partisan politics whatever strongly held dogma given scientific theory offends.

Reddit wants science like sports teams, anyone challenges team anti-science, credible.

The irony people think they're side history Galileo on, fact they're siding church imprisoned sorry whole idea scientific method consensus repeatability.

This patently false Yup, I've thinking. considering shitty news, think gradual incline toward 3rd quarter 2021 relatively easy handle. 

We got this! really matter spike people change behaviour. Hard lockdowns developing nations able provide people (which essentially advocating closing grocery stores) dismal failures. check Peru, India, Indonesia There's data predates outbreak showing effectiveness different materials contaminants. like data changed COVID. masks estimated correctly one wanted listen studies already existed. Right? insane times live in.  far deaths still fairly low. yes know there's around 2-4 week delay deaths France rising around month half since beginning August far rise deaths marginal increase.

This sounds exactly like people US saying months ago.. eat takeout support local businesses. also tip ate there. I'm far wealthy, part support community.

I also know cook, 5-6 days week can't afford eat often that. Yeah, same. March, last day office (mid March think) started working home (I made excuse work home like 4 days, last day shit went sideways office like ""yeah, everyone work home!"" every since).

Anyway, day wore scarf around face entire way Go train, elevator floor (as well Path way in). Fuck got lot crazy stares people. But, Fauci said wear masks initially pulled baseball game July. hypocrisy sparked resistance wearing mask. Trump's ignorance fanned flames.  walked China town encouraging people visit DeBlasio encouraged New Yorkers go daily business, use subway, etc March think would supported full country shut down? ridiculous criticism saw leveled Conservative supporters ""hiding out"" instead getting supporting Canadians late March April literally following rules put place public health officials Ontario. me, exactly right thing leading example.

I'm also superfan, much mudslinging Conservatives year ridiculous desperate looking - see popularity manufacture controversy play media, little ridiculous hope Canadians see it. didn‚Äôt say fine. said didn‚Äôt return hospital re-admission. Could home fine ü§∑üèª know happened you?

Has everything commercial/residential supply chain shifting residential. hoarding. foods.

You crops promised Disney World destroyed couldn‚Äôt redirected.

You simply can‚Äôt sell commercial toilet paper stores ramp production overnight. It‚Äôs matter people using all. Yes people panicked.

Here‚Äôs example. neighborhood FB page someone posted picture couple full cart tried shame them. looked cart saw clearly multiple kids. I‚Äôm sure family used school lunches eating work plus restaurants. shift home stunning people didn‚Äôt even know looked it.

Plus responsible people prepared home 2 weeks asked smart people saw supply chain crunches coming.

People hoarding general. 200,000 even though data manipulated? wrong way think it. won‚Äôt ever ‚Äúget through‚Äù. won‚Äôt end. SARS CoV2 biosphere us forever. It‚Äôs simply another virus live with. seems it‚Äôs seasonal like flu / influenza. plan wear mask less strict lockdowns forever? longer travel vacation? house hold parties?

I seriously asking ‚Äî would mean ‚Äúwe through‚Äù? 0 infections? 0 deaths? That‚Äôs going happen, hope understand this. 

Perhaps vaccine? even vaccines people die flu. Right? love shaking hands, chatting hours, going events conferences, \*touching everything\*. Video conferencing worse nothing many cases. slow spread curve falls treatment options improve.

Well we've done things, countries still locked people pushing new lockdowns nobody thought lockdowns meant long term solution? Hm see point. live alone know experience. local friends either. two times since lockdown visited parents, got tested make sure asymptomatic. ... yes, air pollution places Asia fucking horrible. I'd wear mask even *wasn't* pandemic. r/Coronavirus hates United States right, economy imploding businesses margins red they're forced remain open 1/4 less capacity (my local Walmart allowing 12 people store time), further, people choosing stay home shop online feel safe utilizing public businesses. 

Shutting weeks, providing financial safety net businesses people reopening restored consumer confidence reasonable, business-friendly measures literally intelligent option. 

We've known since March. adequately protected conditions, would realistically budget $300-$1000.

It difficult adequately protected poor systemic mitigation.

Maybe $10 ok countries, would argue one. Distancing light lockdowns destroying small businesses.

no, virus is. 

Enough people stay home outbreak businesses suffering even without officials lock downs. fact, worse spread people stay home worse small businesses. least, keep hands touching mouth nose.

That's got help some. Obviously, another lockdown economy would ruin. live tourism, bars hotels. We, Republican Democrat, united Hope furlough permanently.

Sincerely,
NYC that's point contention: lockdown could've successful offset disastrous side effects mentioned merely paying losing jobs (and tens millions like you). total fucking hatchet job. somehow Trump cronies still claim we're greatest country world can't even ***after 7 months*** give frontline medical workers proper PPE manufactured domestically. Greatest country ass.

But otherwise yeah agree; government totally fucked us half assed plan we're shocked lockdown work like sort fucking mystery lol. people like worry finances bet lockdown would've effective would've fine chilling home civic duty staying home haha. 

Let's even get started government used undermine civil liberties ***permanently*** well. listen rich dude anyways? billions dollars, could fake way someone listen to. Bill Gates needs shut put real scientists front camera instead wasting precious oxygen statements carry real weight. quarrel statement itself, thoroughly disappointed Dr. Redfield. virologist, behave like one. wife craving KFC, ordered online, went store, picked in-store. 

Upon walking watched employee store next door walk building, mask, said nothing him, saw literally none employees wearing masks wearing incorrectly.

I spoke asked could please wear masks required state governer (Kentucky), every single employee began yelling screaming saying allowed wear around necks shit went off.

It serious shitshow. 

People completely fucking ignorant shit.

We want wear mask protect others, controversial request! course mostly downvoted. answer, example, ""Will free all""? grocery shopping Asian markets. local stores cesspools.  course question they're ineffective, make sense purchase shit tons masks everyone.

It's also bad environment too. 

But effective, help, wear them. sure yet, wear them, wait see tests end up. 

Not wearing ""muh freedumb"" fucking stupid. restaurants, bars, venues, small businesses left state relax restrictions winter. Since latest research demonstrates masks allow people less viral load develop immunity, I'm stickin' new stuff. Also, New York Post tabloid, Big chunk death toll data dump, fyi. matters much. Thank much, look good almost every young person care lately many deniers disease, believe fake. I'm pro-mask **CDC** stands **Center Diminished Credibility**...

(just wear effen masks open sooner) *rubs hands*

""Buy overpriced non-surgical masks"" Turn lights house. porch light. People knock.  too, wait larger proportion population get injection..... I‚Äôm taking off.

The idea we‚Äôre going wear masks social distance years vaccine insane, ignored. Early on, told friends making masks give away, one person particular asked why. ""They good enough health care workers!"" Idiot. get vaccine, wont death rate annual flu, mean reduce deaths 70% whatever... nothing particular wrong me.

That agree on. Take care dont think really ""lied"". US authority think countries like China Japan stupid dont need take advices seriously, re-study effectiveness themselves. 

American exceptionalism finest. Perhaps could make exchange something return stimulus check payments? Maybe country change name United States Amazon return? wasnt point. didnt know extent virus decimated Italy shut China. slow spread curve falls treatment options improve. 

And lockdowns delay virus hitting areas time treatment vastly improve. covid patients go steroids blood thinners put ventilators fast. several studies showing lingers air people breathing talking. masks work prevent infected people spreading.
Also Trump admits knowing recorded audio released Feb. COVID free rest life! bills covered job punish it, would. it‚Äôs worth, lockdown made sense CFR 3.4% IFR estimated 1.4%. know it‚Äôs much lower know who‚Äôs risk now. also know little effective ways treat it. lockdown make sense point, least scale early lockdowns. support limits crowd size, social distancing, masks, etc. there‚Äôs reason close everything again. He's wrong (lack evidence) can't link anything saying 100% certain naturally occurring. origin still fully understood. Sorry fit worldview ""Meaningful relationships people things friends insipid."" loser NEET nothing going life mean are.  still infect others. take care people? yourself?

A lot people going die unnecessarily attitude multiply millions people. sad. guess willing sacrifice people couple bucks they'll bring people stupid enough travel tourism. normally too. account I've kept longer would normally. case though I'm going go gloat guy right because, mean, people dead. might even dead, knows.   Erm - actually no. Sweden continuous soft lockdown, killings lots people place neighbours.

Spain/France/UK locked hard - long enough eradicate get TTI properly working. opened pretty much completely virus running riot again.

The lesson cannot return normal virus completely eliminated (China/NZ/Vietnam/etc) - would hard spend holidays goddamned country one year?! healthcare deaths, however, disproportionate respective age groups, signifying increased risk. numbers also reflect suffering effects illness.

If want able properly treat ill, keep experienced healthcare workers able job. means keeping healthy.

Not mention we're running larger ppe shortages, meaning becoming increasingly unable protect again. Civilian healthcare workers also ones injecting vaccine Pentagon plan, meaning increased need healthy healthcare workers vaccination process. That's sad, 100% true. second sentence really nets out. live here, agree completely. Even Covid, Asian people routinely wear masks public sick order protect others? can't underestimate culture well. ""I'm rich poverty exist"" 

""I'm hungry nobody starving"" 

""It's cold today global warming myth""

""I big house 2 cars America steaming shit hole""

Americans shockingly dumb, actually makes dumber talking them.

Not mention going vacation global pandemic people staying home much possible. asshole are. tells understand vaccines viral infections work, we're rough time. Americans keen learning stuff. love stuff getting downvoted now.

Ultimately, infections unless followed consequential effect (death, lung damage) useless statistic. ton bacteria viruses us. infected something. keep trucking. true would unprofessional bill gates say straight say trump wrong response dumb example.

You can‚Äôt speak authority condescending particular person, many people would see poor reflection Gates rather critique trump.

This type statement provides stance acknowledges issues sees throwing direct insult could land greater issues.  hilarious, Redditors become deranged Trump/Russia they‚Äôre literally becoming anti-vaxxers. Since sources without links logic flies face disease specialists, thing merely wannabe trying start reddit. case, pathetic. ""A new pre-print paper (which means yet peer reviewed published journal) claims SARS-CoV-2 genetically engineered. provides data reasoning sound plausible. (The technical aspects go beyond scope article.) ""

If article can't understand technical details, maybe used confirm anything. 

This spike protein, paper edit it. Pfizer ask FDA increase participants 44,000. first vaccine reach original target participants goal. Reddit great topical discussion circlejerking fellow political partisans. serious topic science, history, health, etc., Wikipedia better source info can‚Äôt bothered read primary sources. Yes, let‚Äôs ignore people worried effects single biggest act economic self-destruction history secondary impacts public health. Same, back early mid-January. People scoffed me, told things like ""You know anything, right?"" pretended cough around mock me. Americans brainwashed saturated corporate media they've relinquished common sense favor dishonest institutions Social distancing effective masks. Stay fuck home. That's they've saying. No, yes! exactly point. Sweden model shining example all.

And messaging masks continues tilted **against** even recommending them:

8/19/20: ""Sweden‚Äôs top infectious disease expert [Tegnell] resisted recommending face masks general population ‚Äî arguing it‚Äôs 'very dangerous' people believe coverings alone stop spread article, however, trust Tegnell says video **5 days ago** face masks:

""Any kind review read face masks, everybody agrees [sic!] evidence weak effect. effect, probably big."" Lethality Spain lower first wave cases commonly young people, least responsible care this. lied every step way everyone involved. Nobody believes anything anyone official position tells anymore.

It's total misinformation pandemic. Nurse here. mostly airborne. spread via droplet. becomes airborne infected aerosol-generating procedure, ET intubation extubation, manual ventilation, bronchoscopy, etc. link list.

http://pemcincinnati.com/blog/which-procedures-are-aerosol-generating/

This means community transmission existing cases controlled, restrictions relax ‚Äî social distancing masks still highly recommended. state (Queensland, Australia) done keep borders closed enforce two week quarantines testing residents coming home outside state. (One case another state previously tested negative, full two weeks quarantine, started showing symptoms, got retested came positive. incubation period sometimes longer recommended quarantine period.) such, actually go restaurants bars. Schools continue. state government listened every single time Chief Health Officer ‚Äî CHO highly experienced qualified doctor get job nepotism. 

This means lockdowns recommended places community transmissions. even then, ought questioning road map politicians making calls.

A good example botched job Philippines. rife corruption. government employees got job due nepotism ‚Äî including health officers head Department Health. president fascist vigilante cares politicising pandemic party's gain. road map. nothing lockdowns government efforts trace control community transmission. favourable ruling party community transmission perfect excuse abuse power.

Edit: Regarding example ‚Äî takes standard precautions avoid contact transmission described. means someone tasked disinfecting area someone sat prior next. Restaurants bars part Covid-safe plans requirement operate. definitely operates like third-world shithole, descriptor applies increasing number Western countries days. Weird demand drugs fallen least anecdotal experience, price skyrocketed. literally political official though. working white house heading political response virus. also negative results

Really?! study says wearing masks increases infections? US already unofficially herd strategy. states never locked all, interstate travel restrictions (except Hawaii).

I think NY tried never enforced it.  agree Cuba far utopia.. take consideration circumstances embargo location resource like sugarcane, really compared place like Mexico countries Cuba lot better. Mexico rife violence cartels running everything. Latin America general issues poverty whether they‚Äôre communist capitalist. Corruption really hurts either system.. 


I‚Äôm necessarily anti-Castro... obviously radical.. totally see would want kick Batista big companies imperial capitalist yankees north coming exploiting labor resources benefit northern States. benefit benefit only. North America always shaking hands banana republics.. crooked businessman taking advantage locals indigenous less power.. free market capitalism nothing oppressing them.. 

I think it‚Äôs becoming apparent America capitalist utopia either.. lot deaths gun violence.. lot people uninsured work low wages.. one paycheck homeless. America‚Äôs definitely utopia.. might utopia like small percentage country it‚Äôs balance.. 1. what? contained virus better economy places like Sweden lock down.

2. taking one quarter, extrapolating entire year, comparing way countries. 

Listen, clearly strong political/ideological bias making cherry-pick stats taking context. try stop that. high enough feel like sneezing tearing low get either sensations Sounds like plan DMZ makes effectively island. think would wiped cults night clubs. people keep praising Cuomo pretending New York every state strive emulate? know hit hard early nursing home debacle alone enough completely invalidate leadership.

Stop trying re-write history, Cuomo‚Äôs actions killed You‚Äôre literally fascist. You‚Äôd create economic emotional damage ( leading death) far excess you‚Äôre claiming save people from, make people want.

The biggest reason someone doesn‚Äôt mask business forgot car, you‚Äôd come SWAT team. Yea yahoos, haven‚Äôt even proven superspreaders. Imagine spend last 6 months living small house 5 people, spend almost time them.  
That'll give idea lot us feel barely gone seen family friends since March. SHit, Im supposed moving spain less 2 months... scientific method works using new evidence build existing knowledge. absence specific data novel coronavirus, extrapolate based properties similar viruses *do* evidence for.

You sit around thumb ass pretending totally ignorant whether masks effective respiratory virus. ways, bars remain closed CT. Businesses wouldn‚Äôt survive, likelihood wouldn‚Äôt 100% effective, meaning you‚Äôd thing January/February. economy isn‚Äôt imploding hundred people catching virus per day.  idiots problem BLM protesters? taken beaten. I'd imagine maybe hope vaccine proven work beyond doubt, would ramp production wait necessary. rare adverse events occur vaccinated population, find alarming healthy participant experienced transverse myelitis, neurological disorder, people received vaccine. Assuming spinal cord inflammation possible outcome, would seem pretty predictable tip iceberg distributed population large, including elderly risk mortality due Covid.

Whether company intends turn profit not, fully invested getting vaccine produced. They‚Äôve already started manufacturing vaccine distribute would take huge loss.  Giving information stockholders general public sketchy best. Even 99% accuracy would useless give results week later people still going normal smh know pandemic ruined alot people's plans get married. Depending situation next year may worth considering smaller wedding large gatherings still 1918 far worse lol. We‚Äôre listening science says shouldn‚Äôt lockdown One day know virus camefrom. dont think anyone pushing lab theory among solve riddle.
For PRC standards China amazingly transparent still say virus originated Tennesse discovery descpription publication genome (making test possible) would occured much later pandemic. large corporations talking about? People pull shit thin air. airlines pay portion back. PPP loan helped mom pop places primarily. Ah linked wrong first article then, I‚Äôll try fix work I‚Äôm sure find plenty discussion via google. broad consensus nearly hospitalized patients suffering symptoms even weeks discharge Sweet doubts, look 'flat Earthers' Nobody said there's record incorrect statements. evidence circumstances change. evaluating past statements current evidence, turning blind eye information available time. ya guess we'll see 1918 Recommending masks public strategy different claiming masks ineffective. Im going argue you, know wont point either us. Soooo, everyone get rid cities? making stuff spreading debunked clear lies. It‚Äôs gotten tiresome constantly debunk people‚Äôs lies, clearly care listen continue worshiping cult leader.

Yeah, Fauci since gone record saying unscientific Trump Trump longer paying attention ongoing crisis Trump cares election. That‚Äôs it. No, let many Chinese sneak Europe. Florida‚Äôs excess death totals also suggest massive undercounting. Damn it‚Äôs getting postponed guess. Winter supposed catastrophic third wave would wipe away humanity Rhode Island opened in-person K-12 week, along good number colleges/uni‚Äôs students campus. 

We already getting reports spikes. Anecdotally, tests already taking longer get appts for, get results. 

Check back RI two weeks; cases due K-12 showing then. think state‚Äôs data comparatively reliable.

ü§û definitive proof virus leaked lab, instead undeniably proven ""natural"" origins, bets table.

The burden proof finding evidence virus ""lab created"" (remember mean nefarious, research virus use gain function techniques happens everywhere, China), burden proof finding undeniable evidence natural origins. far tell, undeniable proof found yet. What's prediction winter/future all? vaccine talk? interpretation video discourages people wear masks, saying masks work? make ***worse*** knows masks offer protection, discouraging Americans wearing them? That's better Trump downplaying virus knowing serious is. Denmark week unfortunately, hopefully recent changes help three US states lowest case numbers mixed among Canadian provinces/territories Vermont, New Hampshire Maine, bordering Canada. don‚Äôt inject insulin every hours could die diabetic shock. 

Depends diabetic regiment. know several diabetics need insulin, stay away certain foods know spike blood sugar. One personal doesn‚Äôt sound healthy. Lol

Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler played Type 1 diabetic. Would say NFL quarterbacks unhealthy? everyone see article suggesting parties wore mask, non-infected might get immune response around someone infected, similar response vaccination? what? lied? public need information, acceptable lie public?

If concern trying solve *immediate* collapse healthcare system total lack PPE, lying public inherently wrong -- conduct cost-benefit analysis balance potential decrease trust future real risk immediate catastrophe. Now, reasonable people certainly disagree relative costs benefits whether made right choice, think saying wrong thing lied silly naive. pandemic seen positive Peru, ridiculously expensive 'normal' amount experience expertise had. 

Now lack health personnel government agreed pay them, $2000 month living travel expenses taken care of, plus health insurance benefits, lot considering average doctors experience paid $1100-1400 monthly, paid 2 months problems system time Trudeau chose take test, COVID-19 testing short supply genuine concerns US would cut testing reagents masks using Defense Production Act.

There also lot complaints people privileged situations could get COVID-19 tests easily people could not. think active choice forgo testing (a) situation legitimately didn‚Äôt warrant - already infected wasn‚Äôt anything could anyways - (b) better save test someone could make difference. nah fall / winter, we're still summer reclassified old deaths probable COVID added death reported 139 new ""probable"" coronavirus deaths Tuesday, pushing state's death toll new deaths diagnosed probable cases antigen tests COVID-19 contributing underlying factor death certificate, health officials said Tuesday news conference.

Source: 676 new cases logged Arkansas. Hospitalizations 11 389 Tuesday afternoon 17 additional people died virus. top counties new cases Washington County, Pulaski County, Benton County Sebastian County.

It looks like numbers, quoted article, numbers last 24 hours. I'm Arkansas (VA here) know mean. friends trying invite partner dinner, breweries. Even we're socially distanced strangers, friends ""careful,"" can't get close them. asthma almost 5 month old baby. always feel like I'm kook something friends look us taking seriously... selfish risking families. American watching pandemic fuckin depressing. Good luck state. People understand science works, evidence changes time thus recommendations change. Nope, ""big science lies"" durrr Go back China Back April thought Italy hell.

Now........I hell guess common sense. CDC saying rest us need N95 masks, true, true rest us need haz-mat suits.

That mean take precautions. formal scientific education beyond core college classes, pulled family back public first week March. started getting groceries delivered, ordered bunch stuff bulk local restaurant supply. fortunate ton work without coming contact others, family members sometimes came studio get house (it's basically big empty space office) kids could ride skateboards stuff like that

The idea people bother figuring stuff they're busy watching sports reality TV really disturbs Buzzkill Actually, [Clorox wipes bit hard get right Apparently, wipe material also used stuff like medical masks.

On hand, local Walgreens off-brand wipes. disinfectant, likely crappier material. Clorox wipes actually terrific cleaning grease stovestops; know off-brand ones.

Bleach, Clorox-brand not, easy find.

Edit: so, tests, it'll depend whether there's important competing use resources. hand, given lack testing contributing $1T drop US economy, Feds chipping in, say, $100B widespread rapid megatesting would seem like wise investment. would like proper answer question, offer speculation: authoritarian government population used that. compliance might better harsher actions government.

Again, pure speculation I‚Äôve read, take ;) virus proven mostly airborne

The virus mostly thought transmitted droplets opposed aerosols, partially aerosolized particles easily diffused partially small carry significant viral load. 

Droplets, larger, tend fall opposed remaining airborne significant period time.

While completely understand concern, know transmission virus contradicts theory breathing air later evening.

The interesting thing entire conversation I'm caught person wants restrictions lifted want life back person wants restrictions enforced want stop/slow spread, feeling bit panicked -- -- opportunities safely make happy based know right now. confident carefully-planned actions. polarizing entire subsection population marks sign ""weakness sheep mentality"" wear mask.

The original idea went initial instinct NIH/CDC, distribute masks ramp production. trouble mechanisms place maintain supply stockpile replenish distribute already disrupted within first year administration kept wraps degree. Thats first confusion, scrambling get non medical personnel make home masks go instead putting huge demand already short supplies.

Online retailers help matters time continuing upmark price purchase supplies.

Well powered studies indicate masking prevent person spreading disease prevents someone getting crossover there. Additionally, get smaller viral innoclum repeatedly due wearing mask/eye protection around sick people, chance get gradually build immunity time hopefully limit symptoms get full infection point. idea currently studied several countries among Healthcare personnel regular exposure wearing PPE. let anit-maskers see field day one political party charge - one fault bungling pandemic response? Canada's pandemic plan, always available public, written 2015, recommended masks public. cites scientific studies say benefit would negligible potential risks non-compliance measures primary reason, addition supply issues.

You fake news.

You sowing distrust science. 

You scientist leading edge, uneducated conspiracy theorist.

You problem solution.  Wasn‚Äôt second wave last month sum they‚Äôre hitting enough events. Cynically speaking someone involved drug development know minorities get covid way often, also way less likely enroll clinical trials. 

Or interim analysis showed weren‚Äôt powered enough hit 50% efficacy, need enrolled get p value. 

This trial structured unlike many others - unblind whenever, point hit significance stop.  way? still get people arguing pros cons lockdown vs lockdown many Asian countries able effectively contain spread also minimizing negative social economic consequences. much reason believe disaster believe will.

Coronaviruses display seasonality influenza. Everything know suggests massive increase transmission.

Which exactly public health officials warning months.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Fuck yea gonna lie literally never spent time groups 6 people outside work situations. whilst definitely new restriction, slightly targeted impact everyone. Almost like disease like life threatening miasma sorts political group events others. realize places US nearly fully open outside large gatherings like sporting events? wear kn95 mask day long work. feel enough (in conjunction social distancing), Im area highly impacted virus. Regarding ""false sense security"" parroting, agreed. Im protect sense security action give me, real. Seems like everyone wants go million mental contortions face reality, take responsibility action. pandemic shows collective victim mentality collective denial does. Big Ten mandated its‚Äô restart rules 21 day layoff football activity player tests positive. Also 5% team gets infected, team suspend football activities entirely. comment's arrogance makes read less intelligent.  grade idiot. hate Trump, probably worse. Again? never really first time. Finns too. hope tell THL (local CDC here) shut fuck up. Yeah, mean, know IFR sure definitely lower CFR. want make estimate US least use CDC's latest IFR estimate, believe 0.65%. might higher lower, lot closer using CFR. Yeah, least US 10x number can't accurate more. said, clearly something going on, even look numbers OP, show R dropping NYC prior lockdown, 3 around 1.  Nah watermelon one better fearmongering must end.

That requires nuance slight amount intelligence. expect people around here. hospitals danger shutting down

this starting ""national security issue"" feel may shock you, China probably lying. Individual people whatever want long attend stupid Zoom classes anymore.   *we always war coronavirus* range studies cited paper 0-10%. 
 article, however, looks actual markers concludes rarer previous studies suggested influenza.
 influenza generally driven heterosubtypic immunity shown B cell mediated B cell antibody repertoire contributing significant amount due previous exposure. antibody influenza strain repertoire going limit infection spread within body. SARS-CoV-2, asymptomatic cases believed driven cell response (and possibly B cell antibody response school children...maybe...but unlikely adults given short lived B cell memory coronaviruses). cell driven response, infection host cells occur clearance occurs. cardiomyocytes expressing ACE2 surface, receptor SARS-CoV-2 entry, really surprise we're seeing high percent myocarditis cases symptomatic asymptomatic cases. don‚Äôt inject insulin every hours could die diabetic shock. doesn‚Äôt sound healthy. Lol Agreed. Draconian lockdown no, cases could exported Wuhan around world, certainly seeded around country, well (especially Lunar New Year travel). I‚Äôd wager there‚Äôs endemic community transmission going isn‚Äôt reported on. providing proof that? Ok. Cool. None debunked. 

You watch shit eye. Read eyes. refuse to. paid post conspiracy theory nonsense? English pretty good discussed it. Obviously, would concern fact might negative consequences. Nonetheless, president listened recommendation went mitigation,

-Fauci Okay, things there. video Biden referring travel ban, referring Trump demonizing Chinese people referring virus ""China virus"". Secondly, PJ Media ranked extreme right wing source mixed results factual reporting reliable source. lastly, Biden actually voiced support travel ban China (as well emphasizing action taken that) Thank you! appreciate that-I think important note first article linked patients existing comorbidities, new health problems COVID second article necessarily describe remaining symptoms ‚Äúchronic‚Äù yet, rather lingering symptoms. 

I completely agree seeing patients (especially ones hospitalized) developing new chronic health problems, I‚Äôm sure confidently report rate happening point. keep seeing 2 different Covid death tolls us. CDC 180k roughly, James Hopkins 196k. sources saying 200k. 

I doubting could hit 200k already has. conflicting sources telling different. main argument virus man-made spike protein (which binds human cell receptor called ACE2) shown non-ideal binding receptor. bind tightly, computer simulations suggest sequences would better binding. evidence virus man-made because, presumably, bioengineer would chosen different spike protein gene sequence.

From video watched, process lab question transmission tests inject virus ferrets they'd able pass among close proximity. natural, accelerated. We're talking CRISPR level stuff here. College partying. South getting better, past peak recovering. Midwest seems 'hot spot' less populated numbers big. Don‚Äôt worry, America take second-place lying ‚Äî we‚Äôll beat Belgium‚Äôs accurate numbers even fraudulent low numbers, mean super duper won. ok and? want play virus may may kill you? 

i don't. 

sorry, 

down voting change anything said. think would star Billy Zane. dad right mate. maybe listen Exactly. Even ‚Äúshutdowns‚Äù pretty open. thing changed couldn‚Äôt go restaurant movie theater. Every business scrambled defend essential, many businesses necessary stayed open.  I‚Äôm sure didn‚Äôt stream movie demand first place. money would made that. think estimated value bill gates. remember early February ‚Äúdid math‚Äù /r/Coronavirus post arrived conservative estimate 300,000 dead US, laughed downvoted. It‚Äôs 7 months, I‚Äôm sad right. Fun times!

I mean, 50%, say right.  haven‚Äôt paying much attention honest, start lockdown ban assault firearms, clue anything else think vaguely remember family mad pushing stuff too.

I‚Äôm necessarily mad ban, way media presented made seem like able push panic lockdown without properly consulting That's communism means friend, one propagandized Oh dear leader... frequently cited evidence masks, often misread. cloth mask wearing group get sick frequently control group control group following standard protocol. Meaning control group wore surgical mask entering infectious wards (while intervention groups wore surgical cloth masks time) deemed unethical expose workers risk going unmasked. study tells us wearing cloth mask time less effective wearing surgical mask high risk situations. unmasked group study. Glad parents recovered... here's hoping mental health improves too. Disgraceful. Mette Frederiksen pointed health officials warning country ""was edge second wave.""

""Infections high level. number hospitalisations risen,"" said message posted Instagram. tried India bro straight good time great guitarist/singer/songwriter clearly never bothered science school shows. Lately I‚Äôve interested virus came from. mean, yes-the bat.

Bats one largest reservoirs viruses, humans encroaching wilderness areas, disturbing bat habitats, farming massive numbers livestock reasons pandemic happened. 

All problems listed much worse near future, prepare novel diseases emerging more. Construction, deadline fairly similar. takes prize, sure, large-scale deadline ever met decent accuracy... Feature bloat may happen humans even less predictable badly written system... It‚Äôs needed. See Germany doing. never went full lockdown numbers always control. It‚Äôs possible avoid certain activities, church services. What's treatment? know much reduces mortality rate? Stop. Predicted 200K months back oct,1. Congrats, 2 weeks ahead plan. December 31st make 400K ok? mean 0.5 year period? 6 months. Time flies!

Also even adjust 9 months still higher. ü•≥ people stupid ‚ÄúTerrible terrible question, next one please‚Äù comment

Exactly.. day counting useless bring hate. want family China go safely without mask. That's feel too. work high risk people I'm declining invites choosing go mass gatherings events time. course want would feel guilty hell passed co-workers even like, let alone risk people dependent care close contact. judge hell ~~murderers~~ people. #gameover  talking comments like proving point to? donald trump isn‚Äôt reading thread. 99% people need to. second thought, ignore guidelines. 
Free Michigan!
Free Minnesota!
Don‚Äôt wear mask 
Come rallies. need praise. situations herd immunity might achieved population immunity reaches pI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ1/R0. example, individuals likely get infected transmit contacts, super-spreaders likely get infected first. result, population susceptible individuals gets rapidly depleted super-spreaders pace transmission slows down. However, remains difficult quantify impact phenomenon context COVID-19. R0‚Äâ=‚Äâ3, Britton et al.2 showed that, account age-specific contact patterns (for example, individuals years substantially less contacts aged 20‚Äì40 years), herd immunity threshold drops 66.7% 62.5%. assume number contacts varies substantially individuals within age group, herd immunity could achieved 50% population immunity. However, scenario, departure formula pI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ1/R0 expected always set individuals potential super-spreaders. super-spreading driven events rather individuals, control measures reduce modify set potential super-spreaders, may limited impact herd immunity. Another factor may feed lower herd immunity threshold COVID-19 role children viral transmission. Preliminary reports find children, particularly younger 10 years, may less susceptible contagious adults3, case may partially omitted computation herd medix arguing exactly that, paper points math flawed assume makes someone superspreader innate people change.

Also know things like lockdowns mask wearing effecting spread, However, scenario, departure formula pI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1‚Äâ‚àí‚Äâ1/R0 expected always set individuals potential super-spreaders. super-spreading driven events rather individuals, control measures reduce modify set potential super-spreaders, may limited impact herd immunity

so even math right papers peer review one nature has, clear reasoning sound.  live TN that's picked it, TN increase. Even view national level see highest number daily new positive cases entire pandemic 12 days July 4th. left side sellers home page.
You also send messages sellers!
Also feeling extra social send messages people left reviews product. Everything suck sure, love back atcha. Hang there. Yeah family ""joke"" right oldest two trying kill (they basically anti-maskers) get will. two youngest trying keep alive know anything decent anyone hope time change! Gotta keep humor even bit dark. Yeah , however town trying away image. shut lot shit since jersey shore days, although don‚Äôt know happened there. Shore house private property guess technically can‚Äôt tell owner rent. 

Pretty surprised lately pushing back degenerate party bullshit Check 09/14 value again. may need clear browser cache refresh page.

/u/nevernotdating seeing 09/14 values higher previous days. may seeing outdated tool tip. Bobbing apples!!!! remember started idiots would say flu. I'd point flu could compare flu 1918.

Now looking like COVID-19 may worse. 7 months US, we're almost half-way low-end estimate 1918 flu lasted 2 years.

Here's thing though, 100 years worth medical advancement. seems COVID-19 happened 1918 Americans would've died, flu 1918 happened today, fewer people would've died. honest... honestly unwashed masks. harm good washing masks, negates degradation washing. know, living. 1st exercising. onto strokes. sub ridiculous. ...none. think coach would speak like players hospital dead?  Agreed. excuse this. need make civilization better. *At least* 200K. Add ""excess deaths"" 2020 far we're way beyond 200K. Ralph Baric, Ph.D. UNC TWIV couple episodes back discussing this. Dude highly respected. Said many people completely forget trials currently underway right potentially enormous implications battling pandemic. People completely consumed vaccine prospects (rightfully so) fail understand promising therapeutics 'could' be. incredible research going right now.... Ya maybe 30 years ago prior. that's good son. :)  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è always get wrong testing cause mass hysteria intended. 

Can elaborate ""as intended""? Thank linking article shows correct. 7-day average deaths moving past week. 7 day daily average 759.

It 781 09/14. increase 28 deaths 753 09/13. increase 44 deaths 737 09/08.

**7-day average** Riiiight. Guarantee authoritarian regime using excuse terrorize anyone fights back them. real death numbers limited elite party members. Holy cartwheeling christ WHO‚Äôs attempt humor (is even hell is?) cringeworthy. really really need bring reality actually read hard sci-fi like Three Body Problem Bro, uh, things WAYYYYY dire existential crisis even lethal virus seen planet! hepa filter alone sufficient :) dude probably one dumbest people currently NBA team (besides James Dolan category) saying something. Kind good news, might breakthrough know yet. think would point. probably close down... You‚Äôre 100% right. It‚Äôs sad true people. üò¢üôè Give time. caused huge spike entire Midwest could lead 260k cases depending math. number positive cases spring severely undercounted. overpriced shit enough reason avoid shopping there.

They lost completely thry said job enforce mask requirement. EVERYONE'S JOB ENFORCE MASK REQUIREMENT! people still dead November 4th. 
But, America grown numb. numbers meaning larger get. better us reflect 1 person died 200,000 times. 1 family grieving 200,000 times. 1 sibling, child, uncle, aunt, grandparent, spouse gone 200,000 times. one tragedy x 200,000 Maybe best flu history flus. best flu since Spanish flu, Abraham Lincoln flus. Believe thankful safety conscious comes me. knows I'm susceptible take chances. Exactly right! You‚Äôll notice 7-day average beginning tick month decline. people properly informed situations. US, politicians treat voters domestic animals, feed yes/no options. direct action propose ‚Äúdo shit‚Äù? Well fair people whose employment affected tend lower end income range parity income &amp; employment; so, may flaws logic Gates much money Trump ever could. get amazing relationship Warren Buffet, adopts Warren's idea leaving huge inheritance children makes complacent.

Gate's kids receiving almost nothing vast wealth, rest philanthropy. AFAIK kids pretty well. subreddit complains politics based website, removes ): think took exact wrong conclusion data. USA Sweden among worst world adjusted population densities economic statuses. better president would called upon nation come together selfish douchebags back chance slow thing way down. better president could work non-belligerent congress pass laws give us fighting chance. already hunch too! losing trust vaccine well ... NYC still one highest covid death rates per capita cities globally. hate unmerited congratulating New York NYC anything correctly. didn't. disastrous ripped majority population. Fuck this. bears keep Americans Covid keeps Canadians out. Life beautiful sometimes. Local governments power USA federal government regards local maters.  mean, world would interpret phrase ""there's reason walking around wearing mask"" mean ""yeah, masks totally work""?

I literally never claimed that. simple understand refuting someone said something **does not** require showing claimed opposite? seriously difficult grasp something Oof, kinda sounds like shoehorn beliefs anything, facts damned.

That describe kind conspiritard lies Fauci saying ""masks work"" defending said lie, I'm blind fact Fauci absolutely fucked telling people wear masks month

Fauci advising public wear PPE saying ""masks work"", originally responding trying sideline from. serious literacy problem here.  created narrative masks worthless UNLESS you‚Äôre one sick.

this still generally true. mask much prevent healthy person getting respiratory virus, helps prevent sick person passing on.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: say, write ""mask"" mean ""surgical mask"", that's see frequently. drives nuts seeing ""mask required"" people want get service without it.

So.. REQUIRED even mean them?

I dropped 2 clients (out of... 80?) rather communicating mask issues refused wear one last second argued it.

Had communicated I'd fine, could work something out. Knowing required, tried actively go argue. they're gone feel much better weeks later still. saw risking LIFE must seen taking away RIGHTS thought entered PRIVATE business.

Ahh, thanks coming TED Talk. feel better. wait.. vaccine works lol? live America know lot narcissists here. know psychos. Go check r/justnomil boards plenty examples. 

What makes think spent time abroad? 3 foreign countries actually see it. that's weird, see it. 

Sorry thanks! vaccine gradually return normal life. hate reading ""No return till 2021 summer"" ""No return normal 2022.""


We putting brakes pandemic gradually bringing nice easy stop! 


I look forward this. makes sense. It‚Äôs scary, people need get board climate change biggest threat. China enforce super hard lock-down invasive contact tracing system, need scan cellphone accessing many public places including work, test positive close contacts placed isolation testing. kind system, containing new clusters difficult. degree invasion privacy considered un-acceptable West.

(To fair, Chinese contact tracing app mandatory, even Wuhan, decide want privacy reasons, still live lock-down lifestyle takeout food.) yes. pricing mentioned. Bold claim something approved.

Wait actual information bash hypothetical vaccine.  Right.. literally die get coronavirus. mom, dad grandma. dad lung cancer twice, first time chemo second time opted lobectomy. mom high blood pressure congenital heart defect passed me, also asthma. grandma 86 years old, also asthma chronic bronchitis. 

My ENTIRE family could fucking die exposed, would take one us living house infect us. seriously trying sit say say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù go suck fingers public get herd immunity? Fuck fuck right absolute MISINFORMATION bullshit. don‚Äôt fool me, you‚Äôre scientist, reading comments believe least brain better judgement. fucks sake source ABC news think that‚Äôs needs said. Three different dosage levels one scrapes reportable effect hospitalizations. I‚Äôve hoping big monoclonal ABs, wildly encouraging result. point, say, wear whatever fuck mask want! wear one!! took us years make effective vaccine Ebola. yes I'm skeptical  husband Toronto, says thing. interesting perspective right household.

There never serious consideration US restricting travel. I'm sure would real constitutional dilemma. see instituted widespread testing, particularly people live area, quarantine space procedures available individuals tested positive. fact never done people able freely move around country, also given fact live high tourist attraction area, I've always thought bonkers.

I friend owns house outer Banks North Carolina. entire town restricted entry resident could prove resident. knowledge, one ever challenged that. also interesting, though also past.

I know area, people wearing masks told to, common sense know wearing mask community protective. never positioned wearing mask protects others. protects entire community, enough percentage community wearing regularly. relatives deep red states country mass wearing exception, likely get verbally accosted public. lost minds parts US.  Like 95% country did. Dude, fucking president stoked anti-mask sentiment, argument moronic. really show preventable injury death interesting 2800mg dose met goals 7000mg Yeah dude, stab non-fataly, haemophilia, die blood loss, still go jail type murder. spam need Good luck, Turkey! üçÄü§ûüôèü§ûüçÄ Probably helps thats mask wearing already widely accepted HK island 4 million people versus 331 million people USA. college isn‚Äôt social life, university article massive movie screening? gave idea large groups fine.

They social interaction essential. Colleges focus good amount resources student life sports well. don‚Äôt behave exist teach. school does. Lol thats silly. im wrong, masks indeed useless, worst happens people look silly wearing them. 

If wrong, masks indeed help, worst happens people get sick die.

Honestly, worth time argue dont care. wish best stay safe. Students young adults likely last wave due lower risk. baby ;( 

You're conflating lot scientific terminology. 

The Spanish flu never ERADICATED. means initial pandemic slowed died due degree herd immunity. PANDEMIC ended. Within two years. 

Just virus circulating mean still pandemic levels infection. virus capable that. easy math. 

Secondly, study can't tell us much phenomenon infection large enough scale claim herd immunity possible. working theory there. study can't even determine infection even root cause second illness/relapse. excerpt cited referencing pandemic slows endemic scale. implying seasonal illness like flu. 

I knew start u know u talking gave benefit doubt lol surprised. üòÇ

Also read sources little closer üòú Exactly. They're using Fauci scapegoat hide obvious fact they're anti-maskers, like orange cultist leader.

I mean even point bring Fauci angle now, months fact, long Fauci changed stance? can't adapt evolving worldview - they'd rather follow someone wrong long wrong position unchanged. first stance white house response changed improved covid recommendations. show even show white house updating recommendations proving stance wrong.

Now stance changes white house changed policy liking?

Talk moving goal post. Yeah, Sweeden got right. know get paid extra continue thread.

Look, next six months ahead. hope right. was. whistleblower exposed lol. It‚Äôs inevitable cases go school starts. like colds flu etc.. bet within 10 days positive cases schools rolling shutdowns schools cases hit Construction work tend kill thousands people short span, yes, task particularly risky absolutely stop find safe way it. Construction safety huge deal, example meant argue accept risk get things built consider huge costs go making work safe possible. 

 We're talking people per city per year here. Let covid go unchecked death rate skyrockets. might think spent many billions however many thousands died - no, spend billions to*prevent* thousands deaths. information age, much like industrial revolution. Things change, inwork lot small medium business owners. Many older ones refuse update live week week. say "" 40 years"" well internet, doesnt fucking matter did. Many many business already edge, virus sped five years so. suck? Yes newer , modern small business pop fill niche. time vitus showed important rely community stores others. help new businesses grow, short either adapt die. Sounds like proof, want use insults instead evidence. one buying bullshit. Healthcare workers first. guaranteed exposure get ill general population likely hit higher amounts virus.

For shit they've gone through, least offer protection 1st it. Michigan. document came across. OSHA critically (intentionally) under-funded toothless. Pitt medical researches say tiny antibody component ab8 therapeutic prophylactic effects novel confident doesn‚Äôt interact human tissues say small size means administered creative ways.

Isn‚Äôt game-changer? hard manufacture isolate ab8? Thanks helping us mods create better environment users. Masks provide substantial benefit wearer. whole ‚Äúmasks might protect protect others still wear them‚Äù line intermediate fib told April May start transitioning people masks whole ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt work‚Äù mantra still fresh people‚Äôs minds months prior wasn‚Äôt obvious government asking people doublethink. Several studies linked showed even simple cloth masks benefit wearer, research grown stronger masks preventing spread Coronavirus? see study wound infection OR, relate? I've heard many people reddit discount medical studies came asia. I‚Äôll tell didn‚Äôt sleep quarantine. BLM rioters haha

 case teh government made sure wore mask gassing much possible. Even Clorox wipes( limit seller Walmart itself. Sometimes sellers them). Notice say ""Out live? get tested results back within 48 hours less First assume American amd support Trump quite funny says enough narrow world view is. actually Cuba talked locals all? heard say, problems have? get high horse take advice, grow research, keep making fool internet claiming Cuba democracy. Florida look graph.

I don‚Äôt know comparison you‚Äôre making Florida excess deaths.

You note last weeks, Florida cranking couple thousand excess deaths per week.

Your article AUGUST 12th, comparing numbers to
the current death totals?

Because yeah, people kept dying past month. Right? would‚Äôve thought single mask costs $3? Frontline clinical guy here. person death labeled covid death, needs medical documentation showing covid infection defendable, circumstances death consistent death covid. means drunk driver, example, dies car crash going covid death certificate even known positive.

The 6% issue shows many people understanding comorbidities work. CDC said covid deaths, 6% factor contributing death. Here's works.

A man goes hiking forest trail, encounters bear. Pisses bear gets mauled. Desperately injured, found, taken hospital, admitted ICU. There, discovered diabetes wounds, becomes septic week, dies. Death certificate says bear mauling, diabetes, sepsis.

Some people want say majority people comorbidities, covid count cause death. Nope. Covid bear, bear killed guy. imminent danger dying diabetes, bear actually caused sepsis. Similar covid. People health issues, like obesity, actively killing them. become infected covid develop heart damage caused covid virus weakens enough together covid obesity succumb. death would happened without covid infection, completely legitimate say covid killed them, even death certificate says covid, obesity, heart disease. puts outside 6%. People choke statistic would never say bear kill guy example.

One thought that, people generally interpret 6% minor. Nope again. ways causes death, hugely significant number, means that, statistically significant number cases, *covid need help sole executioner.* 6% minor number, one give us pause. Covid kill alone.

This weird statistical controversy shows many people clue health statistics, form strong yet incorrect opinions things understand, think expertise subject simply manage google searches.

God help us. city Berlin 3,7 million inhabitants. 
Which makes 18.000 protestors shy half percent...

That's generous assuming base people pulled Berlin Germany. Actually wait time city hospitals like 48 hrs. prissiness something routine?

I agree. 2nd time pause happened. pause also happened week July patient diagnosed MS. one batted eye trial went planned ruled unrelated. I'm saying hospitals northeast allowing visitors yet Still understand nerd suddenly medical expert? Shocking inexcuseable üò£ unemployment rate worst half national way better now. 

I can't tell mean unemployed people state national average, less.  thread cherry picking data? something wrong said? [fauci seems People avoiding eachother. See mobility data probably Trump pulled WHO, Iran deal, TPP, spends much effort trying blow affordable care act, generally acts kill regulations placing industry goons command federal agencies (remember Scott Pruitt? Hoo boy), etc.

But actually believe principle thing say, superficial quip. know antibody tests great, NY first round antibody testing upstate came back clean. small sample size, married friends flu, later convinced Covid-19, antibody tests came back negative. know, evidence Covid-19 Albany back then. cause death certificate supposed written within three weeks know what's causing delays. know created something like escaping lab different story.

This distinction get pretty blurry. natural virus passaged lab overtime developed new mutation allowed technician become infected would look lot like lab created virus. That's par recent cdc estimate planning scenarios, assume 70% infection rate. much winning! link university home page, thats exactly point! scroll get content. Hardly takes seconds! rush! surprise: they‚Äôve buying school supplies ‚Äî decades, districts.

When vote leadership shift military weapons-research funding invest schools? Even 5% would make huge difference.

We don‚Äôt need Wall; need school buildings good air circulation. Actually no, distribution much matters. working vaccine use can't get people. plan needs place one approved. Non people seem think through. woman ""Work set free"". Bu slogan said Nazis, wanted people dead, what's point this. stop live spanish speaking country struggling all. What's yout point? What? perfectly consistent. CDC director says begin vaccinating November December. 

So might 6 8 weeks instead 3 4. Big deal. Hardly ""striking comparison."" big issue news things vaccine. headline contradicts said following article states able get back normal late second quarter/ third  National Bureau Economic Research paper published last month, UCLA economist Andrew Atkeson two researchers, looking COVID-19 trends 23 countries 25 U.S. states seen 1,000 deaths disease late July, found little evidence variations policy explain course epidemic different places.
 co-authors conclude role legal restrictions ""is likely overstated,"" saying findings ""raise doubt importance"" lockdowns controlling epidemic. would first time people exaggerated potency government action ignoring everything else. think peer reviewed scientific facts programming? Lol, ok then. spew lies pathological liar. *While infection rates European cases surging,* *recorded rolling seven-day average 108 yesterday - lowest since March.*

This incorrect. Starting week numbers updated mondays. means rolling average get seriously wrong reporter know writing about.

The true values around 200 cases per day, since month ago. that's really excellent point! 

thanks! Speak Bill. team mask rip That's I'm feeling well. I'll probably wearing mask still, mentally getting March/April left hunkering down. neighbourhood Couch Music festival people book outdoor couch stay throughout festival like personal living room. would easy convert Covid19 policies. I'm hoping get rolling next summer. well Dr escorted said covid section whatever... 

im trying logical can, im freaking fuck out. ""When think 'masks', think healthcare providers needing people ill.""

I interpret see someone mask, think either healthcare provider, ill. need mask healthcare provider, ill. Absolutely imply buy mask need save them. need house project requires N95 mask? Fauci say save them, nothing wrong it. 

Face it, reaching much, more, someone interprets ""there's reason walking around wearing mask"" mean ""masks work"". mean, world would interpret phrase ""there's reason walking around wearing mask"" mean ""yeah, masks *totally* Since I'm simpleton, understand obvious fact little known virus

Oof, kinda sounds like shoehorn beliefs anything, facts damned. interview March 8th, month Trump told Woodward deadly coronavirus traveled air. *well known* virus travelling March. Heck, started working home 5 days interview knew serious was. 

 seem think like Fauci. do. think he's responsible one face pandemic. I'll take vaccine says okay. I'm blind fact Fauci absolutely fucked telling people wear masks month known coronavirus travels air. there's shortage PPE, want send people likely get sick spread disease. 

If everyone scrambling get use PPE, chances lot low risk people hog PPE, leading *higher* numbers patients deaths. It‚Äôs people get locked beliefs unwilling accept new information. thing told six months ago true believed then, you‚Äôre telling something different? Hi believe that?

Unwillingness change based new information biggest problem it‚Äôs exclusive covid. It‚Äôs everything. Covid opening act looming climate change disaster kicking second gear right now. 

From beginning said, masks work, don‚Äôt enough them, make materials give ones hospitals essential workers. said that, everyone would go buy masks wouldn‚Äôt want mask, like shit happened toilet paper. 

Humans awful incapable rational thought emotionally stunted insecure are. It‚Äôs absolutely not-the-same. endothelial disease attacks blood vessels leaves behind damage even asymptomatic cases. forget Brexit? worse case scenario looking credible. COVID-19 something that's going magically disappear develop vaccine - even one yet. Harrowing think 2.2 million people may die US. Developing countries may hit even harder. 5,500 deaths per week right now.  also said would've millions closed flights China (though fully). point that. Poe‚Äôs Law strikes again. Canada open sooner. return, Canada kindly requests excess vaccinations two thirds population refuse take donation. 6 percent 200,000 though? ‚ÄúBelieved‚Äù? Departments Health? Counties, cities states. funds hospitals? Counties, cities states. federal standards, adopted enacted enforced locally.  would anyone pay local taxes federal government responsible everything? thread gone Llama... Yep, that's protocol we're considering too, depending situation then. almost idiotic people use 200,000 lives say ‚Äúlook USA winning!‚Äù prediction deaths would August right? spot on. they're predicting 440,000 deaths New Years. going come virus behaves winter's frigid, dry air. think biggest worry right pain suffering we've experienced far may occurred ""slow season"". Imagine look like virus ramps like flu, becomes 3-4 times contagious Winter Weather, maybe even deadly without Allergies boosting people's immune systems, less Vitamin D/UV sun. shit keeps night.

Edit:

Looks like actual current prediction 440,000. effective China first vaccinate front-line / vulnerable populations only, export vaccine harder hit countries?*

I think this. China noted it‚Äôs going vaccinate majority population now, already approved emergency vaccination many frontline military doctors general medical staff already. numbers given official COVID deaths. However, excess death count, closer real figure, gives important number. latest figures, US excess death statistics something like 30% difference official COVID deaths, back June.

So reality, 240k death mark perhaps already behind us. all. completely idiotic comparison make. People generally aren‚Äôt going seek testing symptoms. Maybe less people symptoms therefore less testing Haha tell us master plan direct action Timothy. Go home, Dad. drunk. misinformed, Brazil 19% excess deaths, US. lower European countries like UK, Italy Spain. Mexico really severely undercounting said though.

Source: No. 6.6 million confirmed infected. Even double infected we're near 50 mill 1/7 population, would mean one seven people already caught disease.

That's fantasy think misunderstand. Gates ""invested"" vaccines insofar seeks profit them. Gates ""invested"" vaccines insofar spends time promoting --and donating wealth to-- charitable foundation specializes infectious disease. ""return"" foundation seeks saving lives. Think: charity. Yes, let's judge one particular period life he's done whole. Crazy think low chances dying, I'm 19, shape, chances dying insanely low.

121 kids died, total 6.6 million cases, puts chance dying about.

0.0018333%. 

Then take account 75% kids overweight.

My chances dying like 

0.000458333%

I multiple times higher chance dying car crash. It‚Äôs .06% precise strawman logical fallacy. problem ""contagious sickness"", problem COVID-19. 

A significant portion world proven extended lockdown social distance measures bring virus control. never got anywhere near level lockdown countries did, that's work. California hit earlier. New York wasted time prepare. course disastrous decision send COVID patients nursing homes. two terrible blubbers caused thousands deaths could avoided. Please read comment...it certainly is. Vote blue. Try it. Red controlling everything years. Give blue chance change it. .06% US deaths people 21? Yeah that's always puzzled me. People appaulauding poor countries going lockdown, thing government can't afford pump stimulus like developed countries workers living daily wages days non-work could result starvation. hard tide navigate poorer countries numerous examples symptomatic people going bars etc, seems possible people get couch long enough answer door. 

it's one things multiply population united states starts seeming like bad idea me, even risk individual low (like say everyone decided wear seat belt tomorrow). filled vital need would say go it, receiving candy specific way qualify.

i agree though, much less risky big gatherings like thanksgiving. tired sides point..its nearly month deal,but yet see Pelosi mnuchin meadows chuck pointing fingers making excuses..if shitting get pot,stories like woman never ever happen .she lives ""best country world"" country can't guarantee warm bed roof citizens worse pandemic country world seen meanwhile people voted power took oath protect people put gets go home take hot showers sleep well night without care world.absolutely pathetic that‚Äôs pertaining 200,000 dead people.

imagine someone lost family member reading thread seeing comments using death prove point.

it‚Äôs literally trump saying ‚Äúlook numbers dropping! covid going away‚Äù everyone that's lucky enough avoid incompetent managers, look like action. Everyone gets board plan even know stupid (we'll contain ILI syndromic surveillance PCR surveillance testing!) becomes obvious everyone plan stupid, spend effort trying pin mistake subordinates. 

The FDA totally fucked early hit states preventing spinning lab tests, forcing rely federally distributed test, I'm 100% sure HHS board driving decision point. attempt HHS obfuscate fact picked stupid plan everyone noticed. US exactly well known motivating preventative care, healthy population considering 40% adults obese, counts pre-existing condition thus makes covid fatal. Even considering this, fairly well. current case fatality 3%, still higher South Korea, multiple folds lower most. fair, though citizens nations same, Americans sometimes individualistic good.

So, low case fatality, meh deaths per capita, among highest cases per capita. see, there's innocent party here; every level power failed including citizens. complete negligence absolute failure? No, really best could either.

Let's lower case fatality more, lower deaths per capita, stop spread time, we're going hit 3rd wave, hopefully last wave. slave, mean prison, labor fighting fires collecting tolls USA. License plate prisoners unpaid too. thing is, virus invisible naked eye. ""obvious"" enemy. something easily rally against. easier indifferent impact. saying right course. Yep. get holding onto hopium fault anyone unable accept it.  
It comes science reality though. give shit anyone's feelings. adapt. Antibodies specific target molecule structure. means *only* interact target, like key works particular lock. Antibodies cause autoimmune responses like you‚Äôre talking ones bind specific molecule made immune system. antibody binds covid would bind body‚Äôs immune cells immune signals like that. Yeah let people go jobs risk dying know whenever numbers updated, actual date arrives estimated number far lower actual deaths. expect winter sad eye awakening moment many people. also expect lot ""But could really known?"" illegally cross. I'd rather stay inside anything fucking miserable 1% life go next month last month life. It‚Äôs really apples oranges. Influenza respiratory virus. cause complications fairly well understood.

In context im stating Gates financial interest mandated vaccine... vaccine created.

We've seen Tweet back Dec 2018 Gates tweeted investing significant portion wealth vaccines... full circle 2020 Gates serious interest see 'investment' payout   First state hit hard. Also treatment gotten better. Ventilators thing first line treatment. 
But general doctors need gotten better treatment regimes saving lives. work anatomical pathology labs. work screening biopsies (skin, breast, prostate, gut, cervical etc) cancer.

Clinics UK seem dramatically reduced screening. I've work four months, there's real sign things picking soon, we're looking second wave here. 

I'm right I've got savings, impact dramatic reduction screening services. saying wrong decision though. Depends whether people behave themselves. Winter coming people headed back indoors. enough people decide return normal activity they're tired social distancing wearing masks, quick trip herd immunity, well 1 million deaths. Even ignorantly believed generally like administration left states. politicized antagonized states rival leadership lockdown mitigation efforts. least federal government role advising states action. Telling worse flu encouraging citizens take cruises proven knew better massive failure. mean logic talk anything reddit? Pretty sure Howie Roseman reading reaction Eagles 53 man roster whats point?

Right none this. Everything division us vs. them. person charge sole reason entire incident became politicized, certainly contributed death toll significant way. 87 people die yesterday. 97 people died September August combined. way use numbers lie without lying. inhaler costs $50 USA less dollar Singapore, probably cost $50 dose outright lie.

That‚Äôs partially true. also thought people would horde surgical masks. needed much hospitals n95.

Which totally reasonable assumption make, one said anything TP stopping Covid people hoarded that. 

They knew important medical facilities PPE. 

It decided important 25% public wear masks 100% patients staff medical facilities masks. time easily right call make sure medical facilities masks. people distance supply could meet demand. 

Now course many news outlets twisted told push agendas. clear beginning masks useful didn‚Äôt supply make meaningful difference general public. supply make huge difference medical facilities. 

If instead decided send masks general public wouldn‚Äôt even close enough supply make difference nurses providers would payed price. couldn‚Äôt stay home social distance patients. would surprised people lining give kids one. statistically significant, taking piss panic-making? Definitely! live 20 miles outside NYC. area hit hard beginning I‚Äôm sure many know. decided going start wearing mask following day said don‚Äôt wear masks don‚Äôt help. said fuck true doctors wouldn‚Äôt wear them. wore mask weeks later said oh masks help others. always bs I‚Äôm thankful live state mask mandate bc wouldn‚Äôt even feel safe going grocery store case. couldn‚Äôt say please wear cloth face covering beginning beyond me.

On January 14th saying human human January 19th Chinese government confirming human human transmission. Yes. They‚Äôre literally testing student athletes school every two weeks. test healthcare workers. It‚Äôs infuriating. 250% markup Home Depot! Yes. also generally different attitude towards government science. There's lot people trying say vaccine doesnt work, never come. either foreign agents wanting Americans amplify distrust institutions, anti lockdown people want us *give hope go full herd immunity* go bar. actually feel like there's anti vaxxers sub. Keep calling out, there's huge dump types comments started, pointing idea vaccine ineffective never come. 

Phase 3 happening several vaccines. Scientists well established venues submitting papers peer review, within scientific community (i.e. people actually understand information presented), vetted distributed public risk grave harm. Bypassing system going directly public suggests author/s expect peer review go favor. Instead, chosen distribute complex scientific information far wide laypeople position even remotely understand information, assume sounds truthy enough start spreading lie claim ""proven."" 

In case paying attention, almost every demonstrably false conspiracy theory currently circulation formed - distribution truthy sounding ultimately false pseudo-scientific information hoards scientifically illiterate people simply assume sciency looking information cannot understand looks legit, therefore must proof claim, go along it.

You also remember that, particular case, basis entire thesis gravely serious incendiary accusation specific people governments, makes important get right going public. true unproven claims look suspiciously like political propaganda, funded highly biased sources. directive back March though, get tested symptoms. constantly hammered press briefings weeks. leadership example get tested.

Whether right wrong, directive. That‚Äôs OK though, new partisan keepers Covid death infection data subtract enough numbers assure us everything‚Äôs control heading right direction. reply going provide evidence It‚Äôs also one things really isn‚Äôt worth worrying about.

Like let‚Äôs say that, worst case, spread disease. information? Require people replace massively modify systems bring closer hospital? Totally infeasible, going happen. 

Require people wear masks homes? even Gavin Newsom would arrogant enough think make order stick, even ridiculous apocalypse fetishists sub would probably draw line wearing mask times home.

If it‚Äôs problem, there‚Äôs nothing near medium term address that. Better direct resources energies towards studying topics implementing solutions *can* make difference. Watch Shingrix.... first dose knocked ass couple days. hung whether said ""masks work"" (which, didn't) willing ignore told people wear masks known deadly virus was, spread air. can't see Fauci fucked up, living life blinders on.

Even definition ""lab created"" means could open debate.

We breed mice labs very, specific purposes, exist nature (as commonly understood). lab put together molecule rat, likely would considered lab created species -- still open debate. caught one rats house, notice strange tissues growing (maybe ear growing back, reference famous picture) could reasonably theorize naturally occurring. 

But headline claiming certainty definitively lab created I'm taking issue with. said bad faith, partisan journalism done push certain narrative. reddit ""pro science"" army ready accuse anyone think debatable anti-science, getting quite absurd. happy this? LSU said almost players gotten it? spread people aren‚Äôt affiliated football, think that‚Äôs ok? still saying BC that's part reason kids wear masks class. hallways.

I keep seeing things attributed Dr. Tam seem like misunderstanding misremembering actually said, reasons so. I'd actually like see accurate timeline said vs confirmed health/science info available time.

For example, said asymptomatic people wearing masks helpful. know wrong, time asymptomatic spread confirmed WHO. (I guess depends consider good enough source, think usually goes recommendations), stated specific concerns people wearing masks (PPE supply issues, extra face touching, wearing masks properly, false sense security leading people go instead distancing). ""lies""? look like me.

Here's example March 30th press conference. stance--based known time--seems pretty reasonable me. Later asymptomatic spread seemed much possible/confirmed, updated Cedars Sinai ran supply taking pool would gone Home Depot available HD sold already. Pennsylvania, outside US look Victoria, Australia

Not sure point here. many lives saved LOCKDOWNS failed estimate virus lethality

I'm asking need see convince that. give links scientific estimates it. mean accept likely true? exactly need see studies convince you? compare Sweden many countries locked lock countries worse deaths per million Sweden. convenient you. Disregard rest us peasants need go work students aren‚Äôt coming contact teachers parents. UK France? Boy, gonna surprised read news.. Martial law lockdowns mandatory mask orders worked exceptionally well.  Dude, one telling anti-maskers trust scientists, me.

You're /r/leopardsatemyface material. people really hard time admitting wrong.

Sweden surely vindicated. didn't. wearing mask since late February/early March. entire family has.

Nearly eight months later, cases work facility *every week*, tested 3 times - **no infection**.

Only outings grocery store week besides secluded camping trip hiking.

I never believed masks help. Sure, I've taken base virology, bloodborne airborne pathogen training state requires certain business licenses. know everybody fortunate.

**But basic knowledge everyone known, regardless WHO, CDC Massacre Administration tells you.** Obviously fine, also obviously better 200k healthy 5 year olds, death count overlooks important factor. 200k people died 1 day left live anyway, agree would tragedy. Obviously happening, shows must consider raw death count. 

How many dead going die soon anyway? Hard know (I certainly don‚Äôt), absolutely crucial information determine bad pandemic is. one reasons don‚Äôt stand either side. population 9 million, 5k daily cases would per capita 10k new cases New York 15k new cases Texas. I'm Sweden, even know anyone owns mask. that's beside point. 
What mean ""masks effective"" 2 people 2m apart better wearing masks wearing masks. That's questioned. think even stubborn person would agree hurt, least helps little bit. that's really questioned. What's questioned is: everyone wear reason?

So question becomes a) much better it? much better enough actually mandate it? b) risk changing behaviors, people would choose stand 1m apart put masks on, actually made net negative? \*That's\* what's contested. rightly contested, becasuse definitely settled scientifically.

But arguments (that know exactly good are, may downsides) arguments masks (which good), argument think twice imposing \*mask mandates\*, consider nuances. 

For example: mask mandates public transport likely great idea. can't distance anyway. Great. general mask mandate public probably bad idea. People question mandate (bad) e.g. need mask park one near, people might even dare using public transport \*more\* (bad) know people wear masks there, despite distancing important masks. Better yet, avoid disposable masks altogether. Buy good quality cotton masks Etsy. Wash reuse them. last long time. Chinese living NYC sat asses witnessed world-class stupidity unfold. many times Chinese trying tell everyone asymptomatic stages f\*\* one listened ?? masks widely considered effective Asia f\* CDC US authority say unnecessary? shit pissed bad. sub upvotes op need read understand origin bug fully understand.  lol here. life going like long term I‚Äôve enough. Masks cover wholes germs come of. I‚Äôm Canada never impression masks didn‚Äôt work supply shortage restrain buying masks healthcare workers would enough. China lockdown plentiful supply masks. Depends mean trust. Public health forces morally grey choices society. 

Here, question what's harmful public health: telling people masks effective thereby exacerbating massive PPE shortage among people direct contact virus, telling people thereby lessing PPE shortage exacerbating proliferation virus general. 

In cases, people going die, perfect solution already table. situation countless unknowns, obviously better choice table too. 

Ultimately, decided‚Äîhopefully using advanced knowledge available‚Äîthat less people would die healthcare workers higher access PPE general public. would likely clearly true also socially distanced reasonable fashion reasonable time. could still case fewer people die this, decided way.

That's public health is. weigh limited knowledge limited cooperation public limited resources, matter do, someone going die. Often times public health entity decides obfuscate truth outright lie method saving lives; common. morally obvious choice here. Yes, lying bad, death. reduce death lie, you? legitimately know. Obviously options suck.

Fortunately, science given subject usually publicly available, develop basic scientific literacy, access truth. Public health statements geared towards unengaged. society's acceptance fact regardless important existentially vital information may be, there's guarantee people care, fact historical guarantee significant portion population care produce measurable negative results. someone's attention two bullet points need read several pages truly informed, tell them? truth kill lie *might* save?

EDIT: clarify, statements geared towards unengaged, depend them. mean say they're made lowest common denominator mind. flu shot pushed gen-pop kind new thing, fair. maybe 10-15 years ago people respiratory conditions elderly advised get it. see now.

US could done much better lockdown Argentina example, government money pay tests en masse.  Well, issue China hygiene environment horrendous relative North America general (I've lived time), hence virus outbreak began there. masks forced lockdowns, able overcome relatively quickly.

So masks help, needs coupled responsible citizens due diligence help stem tide surge virus. Unfortunately, severely lacking fronts, especially latter.

What anti-maskers seem able get obtuse heads keep up, longer suffer worse become emerge pandemic. **literally** causing downfall North America, indirectly playing hands foreign powers constantly fighting first position world power rankings. **Freedom comes responsibilities duties** maintains continuation. anti-maskers want freedom alone without work goes keeping it. expect people maintain freedom them. extremely vile selfish.

We're going like Sweden eventually... fortitude continue locking fading. Look states comparable population size Sweden. Ohio Michigan cases average cases per day, 1/3 1/2 deaths. every state sweden deaths similar US would 500k deaths right now. Netherlands bad either. would rather mass homelessness here. mind boggling.

Dead streets exposure, least COVID! üëç discrediting them. saying complacent result thinking situation reduce ""wow, that's much faster thought"" still tragic consequences. tangible takeaways example considering acceptable safety levels vaccines, delaying vaccine profound consequences, risks less important.

We cannot print money like fiends forever. Nobody said did. all-or-nothing attitude unhelpful. Anders Tegnell?   Yeah here. much problem sit-down restaurant, steps still taken. Plexiglass, distancing tables etc. crowded streetcar? C'mon, claustrophobic things even best times. people seem care others though mean time scale able see effective reducing spread. cases remain steady increase people start gather more, I'll continue mostly stay home wear mask everywhere else long takes.

If cases drop well last month, I'll probably relax bit. legit question wish downvoted ignorance. Could somebody send study proves masks effective? haven‚Äôt seen anybody public use masks properly (keeping sanitary container washing hands putting on). people I‚Äôve seen stuff pockets. follow proper procedures, much would masks affect transmission rate? times masks required CT, outside can't keep 6 feet, indoors public spaces (like stores). Masks required eating drinking, thus violation. disease pandemics since good dude. Somehow managed combat without bringing society screeching halt without also ""culling herd.""

This pretty spot someone lives here, grew somewhere else. Republicans could easily rebrand Democrats. bills literally wrote Democrats brought table compromise (Obamacare). Democrats definitely much.

The whole thing blatantly broken, I'm sure solution officially cost thousands lives year. richest country earth relatively progressive city (LA) still can't even get people wear masks stay home. country fucked.

We see happens come November. hope another old man better old man. would funny sad. Yeah one president US liked, voodoo queen. different take. Movie theatres match way COVID spreads almost perfectly, take mask eat, sit one place hours.

In civilized countries, would much successful use social distancing, masks, hygiene, large groups (i.e. church... protests...)

Society cooperate though.  even one becoming fatigued. that‚Äôs bat pangolin first human got virus? understand wanting wear mask, cannot fathom feel need stop people wearing them. insanity. must make feel better wearing one, remove stigma? personally want contribute social isolation people disabilities. know going think others community, important me. triple 4 times still 1%.

That says ""0.009*3^4 &lt; 1"" words. Note exponent exponential equation. Yeah, almost like lockdowns bad strategy clearly cannot realistically work longer maybe week two. Yeah sounds like, ""I want control you"" vs ""I want eliminate virus"".

Total lockdowns would absolutely work, human cost would exorbitant. cannot leave sick would spread virus. get ratios military patrols pass food. Power goes out, tough shit. Sewer backs up, tough shit. Dog needs vet, bad. Thousands would left die homes would spread virus try save them.

This total lockdown would look like. Anything less playing peoples lives deciding ""your job worth not"". political game, public health one conspiracy theorist, find incredibly hard believe authority anything surrounding covid. lied constantly, case counts, spread, death rate, mask effectiveness. patently obvious early masks effective viruses spread respiratory paths, lied. say spread surfaces, know?

2. Even study finds positive results, studies also found positive results also negative results. scientific concensus yet. Honestly, one entirely convinced effectiveness masks ... Especially cloth masks . still cannot buy n95 masks except cheap knockoffs chinese equivalents certification whatsoever. yeah...

First let's leave dumbasses stick nose mask...

**Personally , i'm trusting totally ""not medical use"" ""face covering"" mask protect crowded contaminated bus constrained space.**

**However , here's catch... scientific concensus virus load affect severity disease. changed expect get less severe disease even really expect face covering protect catching it.**

**If virus anything like HIV, masks useful they're regarded now... HIV either ... severity AIDS depend viral load . regard , SARS-cov-2 different , better. still know ...**

**Lastly, still much believe effectiveness masks comes collective effort spreading virus , much preventing contracting it.** Casedemic. Argentina still lifted lockdown. problem people care anymore, need work eat. Yes, deserve awards upvotes saying this. Fortunately looked happening Asia Jan Feb realized masks way go. countries strict masks - like Korea, Thailand, China, far better shape US. Thailand particular basically back normal (with exception significantly less tourists) they‚Äôve mask bandwagon since beginning. OMG!

You mean like 1918 US military downplayed spread virus various military camps support mobilization Europe? 

Or parades Philly corrupt local officials

LOL thing one followed guidelines start. first locked people still outside, mask became rule people ignored it, non essential businesses supposed close ignored it, people supposed gather threw parties. would great people actually listened guidelines simply care got long argument someone wants lockdown forever. totally open masks avoiding crowds absolutely done close relationships. mental health toilet can't another year seeing friends.

And masks distancing park hanging someone's house playing games smoking pot.

Soon enough entire country continent covered.  nah bruv long r0 goes 1 disease go extinct

coronavirus high 4 measures low 1 social distancing masks

a vaccine would reduce less 1 regular scheduled annual flu epidemic kills millions worry about

the big thing masks IMO, mandatory public workers transit time, data home made masks even basic paper masks would effective are

Imagine actually believing this. One single death spike now? someone living Vermont, think maybe 60% folks wear masks.

I imagine depends area. see better mask compliance Chittenden countys, example. 

I feel bad enforcement burden employees (retail workers get enough crap is), time, place enforcing mask mandate, I'm returning choice.

My main complaint mask mandate toothless: there's punishment noncompliance, even stern talking to.

I'm also wishing best wife. Fortunately least deaths 2-3 per day, even though daily new cases high ever. course none. people ""significant proof"" tinfoil hattist's ramblings blogspot youtube.  really give shit anymore. Hard estimate told big deal. question is, degree? effective they?

You supposed ask questions mask on, wait every detail put on.

Agree vast majority people *did* ""die COVID"" Sweden almost certainly much time left. fact *entire* disease burden COVID-19 Sweden is, least viewed annual mortality level, even distinguishable noise *staggering*. keep saying truly hard overstate *insane* current hysteria virus is. that's truly hard overstate insane current hysteria virus is. China Russia worse Sweden! total surprise. thought!

This worst argument ever.  


I see also Swedish. argue like unironically. realise total failure Sweden bring Russia China look good.  people need infected locked produce antibodies expire. can't allow morons endanger people, economy, security etc.

Some people never comply way make longer threat force produce antibodies. appreciate sarcasm (I do!).

The question is, anyway .3% high risk parents already seen 6 months? Lol, please tell conspiracy theorist, I‚Äôm pro mask, understand dangerous virus is, I‚Äôm simply worried effects lockdowns telling people stay home 2 years. didn‚Äôt know made conspiracy theorist guess I‚Äôm pro ‚Äúlockdown vaccine even longer‚Äù ‚Äúwe going die‚Äù I‚Äôm conspiracy theorist. would intelligent could ever actually eradicate infections within 12 weeks, full public compliance could guarantee outside infections wouldn‚Äôt happen post-lockdown. can‚Äôt guarantee things locking massive gamble disastrous consequences. 

If people don‚Äôt feel safe current level infections it‚Äôs government media‚Äôs responsibility tell current risk levels low support local businesses. people anti-business? Don‚Äôt want economy back track?

When group Walmart, Walmart evacuate store. I‚Äôm sure lost thousands dollars. 

Yeah, Walmart afford it. it‚Äôs principle thing. 

These people need go work soup kitchen see what‚Äôs really happening there. Indulgent jerks. It‚Äôs probably fine high risk front line get first  Leading way... grave. really think WHO's fault? underestimate selfishness fellow Americans. Even recommend mass mask-wearing, doubt would compliance States. subs jumps joy stats! Great job everyone!!! must confident success rates first rounds vaccines. lot people take vaccine based he‚Äôs saying. states setting vaccination centers. That's asked plans. severe depression came introvert me, see nobody week except therapist twice week. Virtual platform course. see one. use vocal cords twice week. There‚Äôs aparently limit isolation, even us introverts. haven‚Äôt seen anyone months speak week, otherwise live alone..... fcks mind. WTF still here, ya know?  Masks reduce severity though. someone sneezes behind supermarket mask, say get infected 1000 virus particles. mask, 100 virus particles. Say virus multiplies 5x per day.

With maks exposure: 5 days

Mask 5 days. 

So see getting infected wearing mask allow body time fight create antibodies virus level low overruns system. fact lied country leading scientist. Several times. 

No, must politics. guy never heard Stephen King. hope free vaccine costs less free tests do.  Masks generally work traps droplet spray talking. said, cloth masks without filters risky. Furthermore, article research cited also still inconclusive. contest effectiveness masks highly encourage everyone wear practice social distancing ‚Äî even state spread control. But, like said, lockdown necessary places like mine Germany government listens health experts implements policies enable safe workplaces public spaces. 

If pandemic taught us anything, politicians power policies implement effect social equality, freedom, safety. 

And that's thing Trump listen to. ignored advice lockdown borders needed blamed incompetency. I'm still appalled Fauci propagation Hydroxychloroquine Hoax. still idiot nurses US telling proven thing ‚Äî along lack understanding standard precautions, let alone droplet precautions. (""You touch outside mask sterile."") Nothing exposes dumb average redditor stock market/company financials Herd immunity really measured degrees. percentage needs get virus achieve depend contagious virus is, case especially contagious percentage higher.

You're conspiracy-minded type judging posts, however, doubt reasonable idea constitutes ""proof"" first place, I'll bite: find one credible source piece evidence suggests achieve herd immunity virus contagious SARS-CoV2 &lt;40%. sources (70%)

Edit: mistook poster u/LayKool  Also working people need commute metro/train usually like know...on one hand agree (not $10k fine small businesses least sort repercussions), hand told masks nothing early on. It‚Äôs updated version sooner better. absolutely don‚Äôt want covid flu together. got mine yesterday need understand krebs cycles. brief outline go long way helping, especially terms something might flawed.  got error - here's original article behind paywall. never trying kill first wave, flatten curve. Vaccinations high percentage effectiveness, otherwise wouldn‚Äôt approved. Multiple vaccines enough herd immunity. herd immunity arrives, get treated like disease, most/all restrictions lifted (like masks, social distancing, partial lockdowns, etc.) little risk society COVID. EU vaccines also include ones tested US trials. US higher rates spread making quicker indicators efficacy.

Pfizer, US front runner, actually made Pfizer Biontech- German company. Moderna solely US vaccine, also negotiations EU candidate approval.

Oxford US vaccine all. Several vaccines development EU also received US backing financially, also backing countries,as well. Sanofi would example that.

The vaccines global think. think people, taking mask leaving going feel great, like taking bra long day work.

People cautious careful given green light go back normal going celebrate! going good times, like roaring twenties. Pent-up demand everybody real good time.

The day danger passes going day dancing streets. us strictly followed recommendations going fun celebrating all. Yep Seriously. It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúLook private company using PRESS RELEASE announce treatment get FUNDS.‚Äù

Uh, yeah, that‚Äôs kind works. First class. Last class. Using CDC values IFR age (scenario 5, current best estimate) 2019 census values population age gives following estimated deaths 100 percent infection rate:

0-19: 81.6M x 0.00003 = 2,449 dead

20-49: 126.6M x 0.0002 = 25,926 dead

50-69: 80.38M x 0.005 = 401,903 dead

70+: 36.6M x 0.054 = 1,976,576 dead

Total: 2,406,854 dead

Population IFR=0.0073

If IFR numbers accurate current covid death numbers accurate, also implies around 27 million people already infected.

We would hope herd immunity would limit infection rate less 100%, think numbers useful baseline evaluating response.

(Thanks u/nythro catching error) Americans hoarded shit toilet paper. think would done masks government told get masks? Even government lying reason first place masks hard get. Giving people ""free"" money unsustainable.

That's mean ""take care of,"" right? Yeah, I'm surprised poster got many upvotes did. Yup is. vaccine companies planning 80% better personal favorites ‚ÄúSTOCK DUMP!!!!! INSIDER TRADING!!!!‚Äù Idiots people buying masks could wanted use them, exactly saying need now... people start using masks. still mask shortages hospitals anyway lies didn‚Äôt help all.  pseudo-steady concentration environment, facemask protection found 45 per cent, expiratory emissions, protection varied 33 100 per cent. also observed separation source manikin influential parameter affecting facemask protection.

Given knowledge time - knowledge asymptomatic spread, less awareness complex behavior virus risk organs, uncertainty viral load hypothesis, lower R0 actual, still focus containment rather flattening curve - see wasn‚Äôt main focus.

With assumptions symptoms would primary determinant someones‚Äôs contagiousness, want people stay home they‚Äôre sick, mask behave like life normal. 

EDIT: Sensitive people masking wouldn‚Äôt protect them, assumption public health standpoint probably people would make run masks anyway. social distancing quarantine would seem necessary sufficient preventing spread. case, pardon misunderstanding. fair assessment upon reading person's comment again.

Thank pointing out!

To add one thing based part first paragraph bit misleading that‚Äôs youre still upvoted despite content agreement dogma

I really hope anyone downvotes (which interpret disagreeing) solely disagree mainstream narrative, see scientific issues ideas raised. dad works hospital always says make antimaskers volunteer covid ward. CDC really screwed early on. said something along lines ‚Äúmasks important preventing reducing transmission rates urge everyone wear one public. also ask time low supply need reserve N95 masks medical staff supply meet demand general population‚Äù think people would taken advice CDC wouldn‚Äôt lost lot credibility. didn‚Äôt say anything like damage already done it‚Äôs hot button political issue

This think should‚Äôve done idk thing would different happened things would‚Äôve stayed lesson cannot return normal virus completely eliminated

Do understand long much work takes ""eliminate"" virus? saying completely ridiculous disconnected anything even remotely resembling realistic solution pandemic insane. recorded human history, eliminated **exactly one**, single infectious viral disease deliberate human intervention (smallpox) took **decades** (and building upon literally centuries public health work directed smallpox prior real efforts eradicate smallpox started earnest mid-twentieth century!) grueling work that. even know sure animal reservoir COVID-19 circulates humans act reservoir it, yeah, point completely eliminate it. advocating countries stay locked potentially decades eliminate virus learned about. literally delusional.  Ha, need lab created one. There's plenty nature already thank much lol houskeeper going hire mom said wasn‚Äôt going wear mask. Ya, no. point stands. never heard pneumonia influenza?

Never knew anybody got pneumonia,so know works contagious. strongly contagious, I'd also wary suspected it. thought could get extreme cold.

And tbh really aware people dying flu. Anyway, covid much, much dangerous sorry line comment shows absolutely horrible case tunnel vision COVID given you.

Well, think dodging questin. talking while, answered ""how would feel highly possible givenc covid person died.""

I'm pretty sure feel vert bad it, want admit reason. 

I mena, tacked headlong explain even pretty sure given somebody died, still feel fine even even worth discussing stuff literally believe COVID deadly disease America.

I said was? invented said that.

I live USA either, IDK think do. said wear anyway case obvious anyone masks reduce distance breath goes Never said need stay home....you need follow guidelines...what say area currently?? care, respond bother vainly defend Americas laughable reputation.

Like said, Americans pretty dumb. didn't. videos readily available online. know, extension politics subreddit  would mind much. obvious drawback can‚Äôt socialize normally. can‚Äôt fully express emotions read people‚Äôs emotions half face covered up. very, important me. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone thinking that. Woodward tape getting at? mean interview Trump? Forgive me, put absolutely zero weight anything man says. He'll claim knew something along, simultaneously denying existence. statements prove nothing, that's half problem begin with.

I'm referring independent research cited studies put forth (country's) government agencies, specifically recently read Ontario guideline [""What know far wearing masks public"" (PDF document dated July 6th 2020. myriad conclusions drawn multitude referenced studies indicated almost every case, mask usage showed *no significant reduction* infection rates. Hand hygiene number one factor prevention, noted almost every time. 

There nuances interpreting information, namely studies done specifically COVID flu-like viruses.

Glad feel validated, perhaps instead cautious curious.

Also, updated guidance June 5th according document. outrage *now*?

edit - interesting care address factual parts argument comment below. Considering rioters dumb white kids good one! curious quick Google search. incorrect. Dr. Osterholm CIDRAP wrote article clarifying stances, public comments, include full endorsement universal masking. appears anti-maskers cherry-picked comments ran agree PRRA looks kind weird first, that's end scientist behind paper thinks found really good analysis LSU Med School microbiology professor. peer reviewed journal article anything he's analyzing publicly available genomic sequences check buy it. We've known irregularities since virus sequenced, respectable scientists gleaning useful information origin virus. Others, like author article came getting lots media, simply trying get attention drawing simple conclusions rather putting real work. Thanks suggestions, guys! I‚Äôll look it, even buy dedicated box it... (what else going spend money on? barely even buy proper groceries now) can't believe intelligent scientists still wasting time explaining this.

You can't reason anybody position reason into.   You‚Äôre right terrible situation. I‚Äôm sure side stepping Constitution correct answer. effectively island considering one crosses northern border. Using CDC values IFR age (scenario 5, current best estimate) 2019 census values population age gives following estimated deaths 100 percent infection rate:

0-19: 81.6M x 0.00003 = 2,449 dead

20-49: 126.6M x 0.0002 = 25,926 dead

50-69: 80.38M x 0.005 = 401,903 dead

70+: 36.6M x 0.054 = 1,976,576 dead

Total: 2,406,854 dead

Population IFR=0.0073

If IFR numbers accurate current covid death numbers accurate, also implies around 27 million people already infected.

We would hope herd immunity would limit infection rate less 100%, think numbers useful baseline evaluating response.

(Thanks u/nythro catching error) make incredibly valid points. People think Sweden disaster Australia justified need take good, hard look actual data. Sweden beat COVID taking social distancing super seriously. Anyone Sweden confirm virus fizzled out, 99.94% country die COVID. This. thought ppl would happy hear vaccine rolled out. many hours went it‚Äôs research. get improved out.

A lot suburban towns seen widespread outbreak still vulnerable. mostly confusing luck safety. Exactly. media‚Äôs job isn‚Äôt maintain public trust (even though should). It‚Äôs job that, that‚Äôs paid for. Taiwan ran successful public awareness campaign highlighted benefits masks, yet called citizens leave supply front line workers.

Tam lied Canadians saying masks don‚Äôt work Trudeau didn‚Äôt much better speaking moistly comment. 

The message beginning masks going play key role long term, right healthcare workers citizens staying home, here‚Äôs massive public awareness campaign meantime make home face covering use mask properly. Yes. I‚Äôve cousins family going try visit grandparents turned away. pandemic fucked them. lockdowns have. That's they're saying. people still bought n95 supplies.

Well actions aren‚Äôt directly culpable legal standpoint way prove causing harm unlike scenarios mentioned. Well lockdowns never meant permanent. supposed solve problem all.

So except initial situation (first country hit europe, missing PPE, missing tests, little knowledge covid-19) italy (or countries) lifted lockdown (in three steps: may 18th, June 3rd June 15th) everyone playing game sweden. asshole spreaders.

I‚Äôve different types insurance none ever covered single dime anything. always pay pocket somehow.  lot EU nations still restrictions place initial lockdowns, like they're rejecting anything. better testing tracing easier identify local outbreaks apply tighter local restrictions needed. annoys shit time teachers dump paycheck back classroom. Either district school pay materials employer saying it‚Äôs necessary. PPE isn‚Äôt spent hundreds mitigation efforts. High CADR air purifier Merv 14 filter (250). One daycare (250).

Beards reduce effectiveness masks FYI air gets bristles. virus airborne. 

That common misunderstanding language.

The word airborne mean something traveling air, covid does, word airborne means something transported air, covid not. think underestimated value thinking value masks us individuals. mask keep virus away ME, wearing many Americans thinking. People advocating wearing mask saying protected others mask wearer. Now, possible mask also reduces viral load individual gets seems correlate well body responds. Now, say, yeah, maybe underestimate value masks way.

Of course, that's selfish fucks wear masks. us okay protecting others. bonus protects us too. got hear Chinese gangsta rap Franconia Ridge past weekend!  work University saw around dozen students sitting together inside masks on. told put masks would either 5 seconds left tell much could it. bothers great deal, feel powerless stop it.

sure buddy Well course nobody wants new lockdown, hospitals get full rationing begins many choices left. Yes selfish. want people stay home indefinitely benefit wife care impact people's health.

It purely selfish reason want people stay home. Jesus, lots idiots thread. things need clear up:

1. One Scientist speak entirety WHO.

2. One organization doesn‚Äôt know certain life return back normal.

3. stands World Health Organization. world go back normal. know, numerous undeveloped countries significantly hard make vaccines accessible. Right now, US would first country receive vaccine. Coupled fact we‚Äôre first world country, shouldn‚Äôt take us month two get fully vaccinated. goes first world countries (Britain, France, Germany, South Korea, Japan, etc).

4. don‚Äôt necessarily need vaccine go back normal. Sometimes prevention easier solution. al, game plan early countries, like New Zealand South Korea process/already back normal US still mostly stay home order.

So stop whining. Also, people cursing right now, stupid you? realize control virus? Please shut up, saving lives right doesn‚Äôt need people delegitimizing it. Thanks guys! Maybe look it! Thanks recommendations too!  Ya they've already started notifying people trials predictions based preventative measures. scientists don‚Äôt agree 6 feet enough. someone high risk category like (and myself), shouldn‚Äôt play Russian roulette putting clear? 
3 every four testing positive Madison student faculty member University Wisconsin sub five months ago: ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt lockdown long. trust scientists.‚Äù

This sub scientists close solution: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust scientists.‚Äù Europe emulating Sweden? doctors extremely smart appreciate really don‚Äôt think human psychology side things. can‚Äôt keep saying ‚ÄúThis need end this‚Äù get close it‚Äôs ‚ÄúWell, actually need instead that‚Äôll make things better‚Äù. cycle continues last measure wasn‚Äôt enough. You‚Äôre losing public‚Äôs attention respect constant move goalposts next spring people now.

Health extremely important, mental health too. lack social interaction, income, opportunities fun... stuff makes life worth living, you‚Äôll see people start realize living purpose better existing.

Edit: people might say ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs saying wear mask‚Äù, let‚Äôs real. Mask allow regular social interactions vital human development, extremely uncomfortable. make sense  mean vaccine third quarter 2021?

Don't get wrong, think everyone wear mask, trust CDC anymore.  Nobody said lock forever, everyone saying need mask help re-opening even (and looks likely) first batch vaccines effective promised white house. large group people made destitute once, reacts anger. History replete examples violent, repressive regimes borne economic calamities. Germany's third reich classic example, common occurrence throughout time space. population suddenly made destitute quick lose morals, commit evil would recoiled thought of. point, overall cons mask mandates outweigh overall pros mask mandates.

What makes think so? mind forced wear mask 5-10 years, even longer! Even flu season something. fun college made much friends(that high school me) amount work do. remember time ranted classmates much wanted punch people said ""college best time life."" me. stressing much homework, labs, studying. 

For me, life post college much better. job ends, ends me. take work home think unless given charge number. also nice living space money. started $77k software engineer right graduation. Keep mind emergency measures passed unanimous consent provided parties (including Conservatives).  people talk big game personal freedom want force people wear masks. Trash. one time search scientific journals corroborate evidence numerous studies prove every single thing every single scientific field. It‚Äôs impossible sentiment ‚Äúbelieve science‚Äù without combining evidence respective authorities gathering information communicating public. can‚Äôt separate reality.

This it‚Äôs paramount authorities maintain trustworthy track record. Yup, compare WHO‚Äôs message back March now, pretty much contradict other.

Also cultures already ‚Äòmask culture‚Äô normalized (such Japan) people wear one even cold. Yes isolation worse virus already isolated 3 years due severe depression hit. things manage keep alive lomger do, add layer general social anxiety already had, I‚Äôm fcked done. theyre pretty openly racist, agrees virus fucked Shame elderly deaths. entire post history political shilling Wasn‚Äôt lie back SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY DIDNT KNOW additionally reminds muslim women wearing head-scarves, i've heard someone made jump first masks require muslim head coverings.

No, aren't. Sure, might within businesses required, tons photos videos showing otherwise, particularly UT students. Masks also required churches I've seen lots big clusters maskless people huddled together front churches Sunday service. Go Zilker Auditorium Shores watch groups exercising together breathing other.

Or lots friends posting photos baby shower/wedding shower/etc. inside home grouped together without masks. groups bachelorette parties wandering South Congress/South First past weekend. actually went scarf, conserve disposable masks (I keep hand cleaning due allergies asthma) ""blend"" in. started looking masks late January, stores checked sold out. able get things needed (over counter meds, hand sanitizer, etc.) again, stuff usually keep hand winter colds flu complications due asthma.

Who‚Äôs ‚Äúwe‚Äù speaks of? Thats happens elect corporate socialist like donald trump government giving assistance.  enough social distancing, sure masks important. What's like living country dead bodies everywhere? Also, ghost? Wow! Maybe much. topic political comments allowed.

Honestly day 1 USA horrid leadership would ensured steady supply actual medical protective masks vulnerable. happens vaccine too. 

I see US population continuing mask social distance much beyond summer 2021 regardless vaccine rollout goes... think lot places people, especially younger people, gonna say ""fuck it"" roll dice. Maybe MIL trying get rid of?

Seriously though, really understand kinds things. Surely must know harm done. Perhaps drunk much Kool-Aid?

Definitely overtake UK within next week Spain within next month. sure we'll overtake Belgium since much higher deaths per capita although also count alot differently remember correctly probably higher death toll Good luck tryin find job now. I'll repeat edit - think saw replied.

Locking car accidents make sense moment people go back road accidents start likely same, even higher, rate.

With disease like covid locking somewhat actually reduce likelihood people die come lockdown.

I would problem whatsoever abolishing driving week meant people die car accidents week number fatalities would decrease dramatically.  Lied? even know.

It's ok buddy, embrace new fucked life look world without scales eyes needed professional TV tell wear mask pandemic, hate tell might moron. Masks around thousands years. Fuck OFFFFF. mean, 1 new case today entire country, ~~24~~ 79 cases total. They're handling really really well. city live 12 new cases, county 624, compared entire nation's 1.

edit: 79 active cases total, 24. Google... failed me. Reddits worse Twitter Facebook. groupthink. 50 coordinated people change entire narrative subreddit hanging /new day.

That's coordinated movement change narrative. 4chan never stopped raiding. .win raiding sure.

Reddit fundamentally broken admins know is. That's tried implement policies like banning people upvoting content breaks site policy. see disinfo subs dump comments quickly want get slapped banhammer. 

In reality, needs happen every sub 200k active members, admin community moderator needs assigned moderator team ensure disinfo subs reigned in. 

It's going happen, much liability. are. Reddit greatest disinfo weapon game. Upvotes downvotes. did. [He addessed *severe* shortage PPE. Also, medical proof Covid insidious *asymptomatic* carriers could pass it, typically defies common sense. Also, nobody understood effective cloth masks are. became clear could get infection could spread asymptomatic carriers don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre infected, made clear strongly recommend masks,‚Äù also, soon became clear enough protective equipment cloth masks homemade masks good masks would buy surgical supply stores,‚Äù Fauci added. ‚ÄúSo context strongly recommending it, correct thing.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt long ago. disease fucking mystery first appeared, people responding best could. It‚Äôs bullshit people blame Fauci foresight tell people use cloth masks, weren‚Äôt really even thing Covid first appeared. pretty much *only* medical grade masks (N95 surgical masks) made statements.

Cloth masks became thing people realized mask shortage medical workers frontline workers, started producing them. won‚Äôt say didn‚Äôt exist Fauci made statements, even nearly prevalent available. 

Seriously, ever even seen cloth mask March? Let‚Äôs rewrite history. I'm finding interesting time goes stratified conversations becoming.

I might find assuring person feels isolated safe ways get public based know virus, people try ""shame"" going safely.

I might find assuring person feels helpless slow spread vaccine almost sure thing based amazing recent advances mRNA vaccines, people insult believing real.

No matter position take, someone standing tell stupid real problem world, regard reality. conversation toxic, productive conversations pushed out. need better this. now. still remember jan/feb, vast majority reddit hivemind consensus asians stupid wearing masks b/c protect airborne diseases.

Weird hear even back masks part lot Asian cultures years years now. flu seasons, COVID, common site see people eastern Asian countries masked public. even general throughout rest lives people would wear masks feeling unwell days, common courtesy rest humanity.

Here's article here's another one 2018 links bunch good articles problem dgaf think know better everyone. people assigning ""rights"" ""opinions"" valid reasons whatever want. recall, initial pushback countries honestly many people prefer situation we're in. adjusted quickly enough something like COVID comes along they're already one step ahead.

But yeah founding fathers something. Sheep? know. provided sources claim. statements. Experience what? Lmao World-beating response I've told I'm US called bullshit well back Jan-Mar. started stockpiling surgical masks friends family glad so.

People consider illness context ability work quality life matters more. get sicker chronic/ongoing basis that's me. I'm limit already. Jan 1st vs Oct 21st change? border closed indefinitely safe. I'd argue morning consult question somewhat misleading, survey phrasing matters LOT.

The survey question ""If vaccine protects coronavirus became available, would get vaccinated, not?"". believe second question ""If vaccine protects coronavirus became available shown safe, would get vaccinated, not?"" 

Speaking pro-vaccine, scientific enthusiast: vaccine become politically charged, I'd incredibly suspicious anything Dr. Fauci several highly regarded scientists feel comfortable recommending. Which, considering usual decade-plus vaccine development much scientists said expect something early 2021, I'd come ""no"" survey. I, many folks, get vaccinated soon seems safe, soon becomes available. interesting see winter much effect UK, since weather varies much less season places. Agreed, shitty Yeah, confused March. excuse half year now. Try google, report back. insight people think got infected? Private gatherings, workplace, etc? Thank thankless job difficult times. Yeah wanted to, could go movies, go get bite eat restaurant, go blues bar later tonight. Different areas things wildly different. worries though, mate: ***are already*** number vaccines, ones Western countries final stage testing. ***will*** vaccine! Even every one failed (very unlikely) best scientific minds world working fast hard unprecedented levels sharing information globally: ***they got this***! Sooner later, safe effective vaccine.

It won‚Äôt soon we‚Äôd like, we‚Äôll one. US experts (scientists, drug makers politicians) cautiously optimistic general public, least ages 18-64, access vaccine next summer fall. Bear mind conservative estimate, could bit sooner, figure Summer 2021. üçÄü§ûüçÄ Terrific story group high school students offering maps nearby testing sites!

It sucks lied, also hard time faulting exact reason stated. mean, saw happened toilet paper. People horribly selfish, currently indicated amount people wearing masks know fact important are. ""my freedom"". 


I guess I'm disappointed upset ability Americans band together beat shit. grandparents great grandparents sacrificing everything wars, Great Depression, Spanish Flu basically back back sucked damn thing.

Idiots can't even bothered wear mask Walmart. doomed start, regardless going say think normal cases normal medical issues, studies really next useless. there's much stuff thrown wall try solve coronavirus, bound stick eventually. cases symptomatic asymptomatic cases.

Not pedant, class something asymptomatic case causes myocarditis surely symptom? limit classification symptomatic/ asymptomatic cases based obvious signs i.e. fever, coughing, tirednesses, aches cell antibody repertoire contributing significant amount due previous exposure

So applying real world, think building fires. influenza, B cells effectively like fire marshals mandating things like fire doors etc mean event fire spread much restricted, may still require hefty repair bill recoverable. - Influenza

Whereas dealing something novel like COVID 19 like back rules, people thought good idea make buildings matchsticks use naked flames everywhere. goes, goes badly.

With regard ACE2 receptors, something kids adolescents naturally less receptors? typically experience severe cases less entry points virus. immune systems equally remove virus quickly become asymptomatic super spreaders likely benefiting greatly number viruses gives kids sniffles help COVID spread to. So, comparing nazis CCP? almost want upvote you, know know taking about, can't encourage you. said cases actively going obese significantly increase chance dying covid? gonna add this, Arizona also shared one point ""covid capitol world"" around June-July everything open capacity restrictions restaurants everyone wearing masks positive rate consistently ~3-4% tests hospital numbers cratered mid-summer peak. figure? 

Q3 starts July. There‚Äôs plenty time left 2021 that. Late Q2, start Q3 expect everyone vaccinated. assume 50% country vaccinated start Q2 go long way lifting easing restrictions. sort semblance ‚Äúnormal‚Äù then.

2021 shaping kick ass year. non-ideal mean wont bind less ideal binding site. Many animals ace 2 receptors.

Meanwhile states like Georgia South Dakota, residents happy going along lives.

I'd rather happy 0.1% elevated risk dying miserable exact risk (because virus spreading regardless lockdowns). Eventually enough people would catch recover it, herd immunity would reached. becomes endemic, possible mutates weaker form....or becomes worse burns right seems cultural problem, one may bred generation benefited greatly post WWII economic gains built modern America. selfishness problem America, one nurtured institutions emphasized everyone special, rather rewarding behave well. Honestly, culture seems reward behave poorly, long socially savvy way. hold highest regard able take most, say earn most, rather focus contribute. contributions make improve quality life everyone matter most. Ultimately need get past idea every man island, succeeding based other's efforts. succeed together fail together. That's society supposed about, anyway. No, that's it. case anybody thinks made point here, main cause underlying conditions like asthma, nothing vitamin Don‚Äôt talk respect dead you‚Äôre coming finger pointing people president admitted lied to. least something. adjusted course new information arose, know, like rational adults.

But modern medical knowledge hard replace... Eating outside fresh air friends 10x better health locked alone. pandemic fatigue. masks use long time. things looking better pandemic wise.

Once morons. deaths real. Contributing factors death certs flu deaths, deaths nearly cause death, people die anything health risk makes slightly susceptible. people going die year, absent covid. prove that, mortality causes 200,000 higher be. deaths real. Every one them, American deserved better shit. Every one deserved government actually tried prevent death.  tenth money 

Yes, nine tenths available go billionaires really, really wanted it, right? that‚Äôs also like 4 producers it‚Äôs controlled mafia. Anti-mask people patriots.

Fauci knows this. Every medical professional knows this. I‚Äôm bit surprised THATS route tried take justify mask usage.

I get it, doctors need all, ugh that‚Äôs ‚Äútemporary fib‚Äù, that‚Äôs permanently damaging. Burden Proof:

We take hydroxychloroquine prove save lives.

We take hydroxychloroquine prove save lives. Hey, guys, I've kinda thinking possible vaccine outcome pandemic still end point? Proves point. pretend kids going normal ppl, never be. Yay!! We're winning! Upvoting article 200,000 deaths feels real shitty. Hospital worker .. testing nearly many be. We're testing people nursing homes rehab actual symptomatic patients. test nursing homes/rehab people, take them, would bust seam patients nowhere go. least 2 patients past month definitely COVID+, fever qualify get tested. difficult emigrate there? TV money made politics played role. Big Ten thinks replicate NFL pro sports, done. understand kids, pros. WVU issues kids following rules, schools dealing outbreaks. saying can't done. saying dedication responsible every level. Remember two million? Look lives saved. 10k actually died COVID. CDC confirmed earlier week. US, March numbers really started kick in: half year this, we've already got 200,000 dead. Racism strongly correlates anti-mask behavior, think similar sources - ignorance, desire take easy path. can't even get basic facts right, care arguments? Whataboutism deflect bias....wow see coming   Dunno getting downvoted fucking CDC said themselves. average redditor brainwashed buffoon. people lockdowns follow wearing mask nose social distancing Truly protective masks ticket something resembles normalcy time being. done February filosofy directly deliberately cause harm others. However gonna fuck sake. According article sside effects muscle pain, weakness slightly raised temperature day.
If side-effects vaccine effective good. took TDAP, experience couple days, thats long existant vaccine. know Fauci knew, can't say lying, masks mid February.

He knew going try contain potential pandemic dealing political stooges lunatic President, made best guess could would least damage leave position would still listened to, least while. Europe handling way better US.  American pathological narcissism, contrarianism, selfishness, individualism raises case numbers.

If Americans thin Vietnamese, America would still insane number cases low fatality rate.   much annual travel pass Victoria then? much lowest bids preferred bidders, many contracts gone usual service provider offenders newly set companies run party connections, often without going tender, see also brexit ferries providing new ferry company ferries used terms conditions takeaway food website. Yes want discredit anyone disagree with...i get it. science hurt feelings. hurt feelings feelings towards science change though. even 6 percent something? wouldnt see people going all....whole places would ghost towns, people woiuld freaked fuck out, locked homes. stores would ransacked food, drinks things. think bad? 

this nothing first month thought well people saying things change mind. stupid it, quarantined since late March, wear mask store go anything unless outside even wear mask. 5 days since ive around people symptoms think would safe attend?

No Also there's vaccine cure flu... Afaik, significant portion ""average"" population enough money retire.
5 mil probably high side factor overall average. would say 5 mil like upper-middle class, Gates STILL much richer that... said maybe mask gonna thing saves me. look anti-maskers lockdown protesters. underestimated much simple cloth masks might help. everyone needed hoard n95. Also, another fact brought deaths occured nursing homes. Swedish government failed protecting nursing homes virus. failure would probably happened without lockdown, since lockdown helped all. Sounds like anti-vax argument   already have. Hell theyre probably going get re-elected. perversely diseased country. fuck get downvoted especially point view small business owner?

Does sub hate looking different perspectives want one narrative? fuck 6% idiots  Haha nothing guys say change minds cos they've brainwashed western media lives. 

If go US officially passed 200k cases see gobsmacked people still think flu worse US deaths faked matter evidence provided. Yet comes China they're behaving exactly same. People want wear masks, downplayed many sources (including WHO) ... Also, politics promised ""smart quarantine"" spring, currently max capacity (was targeted track/call 1500 people day, already passed title) smart many people hoped. expected reach spring maximal number patients hospitals two weeks ... Wave 2 Europe come, set worse US laughed long.  that's even assuming average infection rate last 8 months persists. that's case take additional 2.6ish years reach 75%. know sort vaccine within next year infection rate currently decreasing across US large population centers seen worst it. rural folk protect winter. sure ""we"" is, us preexisting conditions fine guidelines. 

I local bar still keeps people six feet apart enforces masks get move around, get business. HOWTO: 2nd wave think awful taste population control joke Basically equivalent entire population Omaha dead end year. GREAT JOB TRUMP, WELL DONE MATE üëç big issue misunderstanding. people think flu catch bad cold 2019, bad strain influenza hit two coworker nurses. People know take care themselves. One 30yo 35yo. work solid week very, sick evolved bronchitis pneumonia. That's influenza. covid possibility even worse require even care. remember year nursing home evening head nurse half residents floor infected. chaos, one died it, multiple others got pneumonia bronchitis got bedridden lost huge amount energy. Plus staff even proper protection gear still got sick kept work. One coworker time got bad pneumonia work 2 weeks afterward. ""just flu"". going logic, person ever died AIDS/HIV.

I'm sure average net worth way lower Brazil aside, lot South American countries took taking covid seriously US, resources lot people even live paycheck paycheck, live earn day. really hard lockdowns like that. words, 45. know concert NY. I'm 44 playing Animal Crossing. fantastic. America, fuck yeah lack foresight. It‚Äôs incredibly stupid. imagine real #s get remarried; he'll never dumbass. make shovel. US unequipped politically unwilling would necessary make happen. Let‚Äôs pray does. people don‚Äôt wear masks eat indoors.  Also agree here, want vaccine, I'll gladly get it, frankly I'm nervous round 1 it, speak. Everyone rushing, firms countries looking skipping steps, etc, hard time trusting much administration late. Profits all, usual. could give shit less article, Michael Caputo steaming pile human excrement trust word mouth would boss. GF (Chinese) ‚Äúgo home‚Äù yelled worse science fiction LMFAO!! umm...have SEEN world war z? legend? O.o fucking dumbass.... youth either. Middle aged adults also losing jobs left right. first round lockdowns going rage 2021 need figure something else out. Pay elderly severely risk stay home instead condemning millions people poverty keeping everything closed. system working well schools reopened.

Expect hear lot next weeks. stats schools spreading viruses ""flu-like"" methods infection. well established. government stupid ignoring them. 9 10 fine then, good know. Yep already done. haven‚Äôt much luck tho it‚Äôs specific survey. main question keep going without another lockdown? sure moment. think prevalent feeling who've taking seriously experienced. feeling 'over it' like we've enough. know still intangible. beginning figures infections deaths coming every day shock. numbers settled cases started going took positive, forgetting fewer thousand dying good thing. Somewhere along line death reduced number, tragedy families get another year relatives can't grieve, bury say goodbye like should. 

We wasted lockdown wasted nations societies. hoped would gone not. hoped schools would return normal way, hoped instead preparing normal. take time mass produce ppe tests? Yeah uped production hoped would temporary still paucity both. plan remote learning kids low income areas low skills? cobbled together zoom meetings replacement teachers untrained make full use them. 

We shocked hoped would sort we're stuck shit. Reddit full shut ins, really never get point much winning going here. remember said we‚Äôd hit 200k July Homelessness basically solved Houston major cities following suit. Another example redditor idea they're talking about. ""I always play down"". Make America great again!? ""the flu kills people"" people still flapping lips finally stfu talking point?   Hmm, right. Gates easily 1,000 times wealthier average American. Even $25, that's still 20,000 times. surprised need add another zero.

Gates sending daughter riding competition like eating combo McD. True. numbers always get weird weekend they'll data dump every weeks seems Rule 6 tho OK. anyone knows else could post :)

Have posted /r/SampleSize yet? Spain's curve exactly flat right now. Im canadian, killed confidence goverments scientific advisors. cant trust thing says....because straight lied. months. backing *gasp* *listening experts* now, could we?

Whenever chucklefucks proven wrong (Which often), double bullshit ""lib'rul conspiracy"" explanation knee-jerk reaction topic never even thought 100% wrong. miss biggest beef US president tan suit. fucking sad opposite happening. Look death pneumonia year vs Florida example. Agreed, conspiracy crowd stop nonsense, preferring well edited sound bites Omg tool...i never said easy...jesus. go house addicts take care ultra caring understanding citizen you. way start streets hurt steal people part help. see Bill Gates's knowledge software makes expert vaccines.

Oh wait... no, can't. 24-25 best time. Perfect balance relatively low responsibility independence. many ministers going violate rule? flu gets downplayed should, think lot people confuse things like norovirus milder respiratory things flu, actually really nasty is. said, COVID's hell lot worse evidence indicating even asymptomatic people getting potentially permanent organ damage clotting issues.
 
Of two, I'd prefer flu...but still really, really want get flu. Even 'milder' stuff like norovirus awful. got hospitalized almost week shit 10 years ago, I'm still dealing side effects damage caused years later. angry Americans die - - bunch anti-science morons loser President can't lead?

I think deserved.

Tell shut coward mouth. Well, yeah; expect people try live normal lives middle active pandemic, you? Man long decade last six months... mean negate impact 200,000 deaths

But proceeds go exactly odds knowing somebody died around 1 17

Dude, that's pretty fucking high. even know anyone that's actually caught coronavirus, let alone died it.

Not mention that's **reported deaths** - strange bunch states reporting awfully big increase ""pneumonia"" lot people US know 100 people.

Lmao point although tragedy, country big enough actually little impact average individual level.

You're piece shit dude. feel pretty ashamed making comment. Thousands miles wilderness bears job fine. 100% correct. 3 weeks drops r naught 1 household household transmissions. mask mandates contact tracing keeps 1 reopens. Look South Korea did. Locking save economy, least short term. intended to. intended save lives. 

The US willing put social safety net required make sure people evicted resources need locked down. 

There's also course cultural issue people rebel go dangerous shit anyway because. (sigh) goes America. Leading world. Murdered wallet...am right? you‚Äôre suggesting want punishment people don‚Äôt break laws? What‚Äôs prevent someone arbitrarily locking prison then? rumors started early doctors pressure call deaths COVID related profit hype. reasonable person might think anyone tested positive COVID dies COVID related death exceptions. 

I think exceptions vary state state number reasons unfortunately politics one. trust numbers Trump administration controlling data mortality caused COVID larger reported? opinion based fact.

Take Russia example numbers report accurate knowing history lie first confess proved? Since see COVID weakness number one priority show strength numbers may skewed.

We know Trump capable providing misleading details situation proven wrong doubles repeating exaggeration plus boldly adds exaggeration distorted facts. creates whole new dimension I‚Äôll call Trump Zone. find sometimes wondering real listening him. 

This guy things views honesty weakness. think reasonable believe COVID reported mortality higher reported.

There needs better way expressing disease terms cause effect. Even though disease observed people think it‚Äôs hoax. disconnect here? thousands victims COVID life goes little change Trump Zone. LETS PROTEST VIRUS OUTBREAK!!! YAH YAH! cop tell friend counted covid death car accident, face, debating mask on. Lol, also said flu pandemic 30 years ago worse, even though I'm scientist told true accept it. Pretty wild world live  terrible article. mention anything substance. even published? sad day Idiocracy become stupid utopia desire instead idiocy spiraling towards. think big problem goal post shifting. First two weeks, two months, July, end year. they're saying 2022? I'm sorry No. I'm tired lied to. Tell long shit hit point won't. ... US

I‚Äôm country implemented mask policies rather fast. worked, Poland beat curve. Right masks necessary public transport shops‚Ä¶ whole situation good large chunk population thinks overreacted calls masks ""nozzles"". think 2nd wave (if happens, think will) worse. Anti-maskers everywhere, it‚Äôs matter society government them. Remember gonna go away own? Good times. Lombardy deaths per million NJ NY. Florida third that. 

That virus came US troops returning war Europe.

Nice try though. True, janitor‚Äôs opinions making national news influencing people. Maybe media stop quoting Bill Gates. Or, using advisors, allow speaking. genuinely inquiring know harsh chemicals destroy fabric time. Belgium doing??? Germany right next door well Belgium failing catastrophically? comments aged? Europe cases rising exponentially US cases continue fall. Deaths unfortunately follow.

We riding terrible rollercoaster, Sweden seems gotten right. thing agree Sweden pro mask public especially indoor environments little downside potential large benefit. Outside recessions like financial crisis US manufacturing output ever grown prior COVID record high. problem we're manufacturing, manufacturing require many workers used to.  remastered! Rookie numbers. Need pumped hahahahhahahahahahahahaha F yes. Enjoy clutching pearls here!  another words, company smoking? True. Look Central province like Manitoba Saskatchewan theterritories like Yukon, North West Territories Nunuvat. yeah, throughout summer months, spring, fall... flu seasonal thing Before. added chances sober drastic go stupid? work hospice we‚Äôve struggling worry harm isolating elderly people friends family protecting possibility covid. biggest thing us covid patients serious lack social support isolation kill person too. asking brings value patient‚Äôs lives. don‚Äôt good answer it‚Äôs hard. 
We‚Äôve tried video phone calls patients unable grasp concept loved one due diagnosis‚Äô progression (ie late stage dementia). We‚Äôve also tried socially distanced outside visits leaves patients agitated don‚Äôt always understand families won‚Äôt come close can‚Äôt hear. 
Again: don‚Äôt know best solution either way means controlling think heartbreak. coronvirus means Christmas capitalistic, profit driven clusterfuck spend time annoying relatives see twice year, worth all, please try keep up... We'll type slower you...

If going mock group practice, ought see actually, know, practice mocking doing. previous post established prevalence cousin marriage among Pakistani. competition here, baseless prejudice people Alabama. 

I offered accurate target cousin marriage jokes, based actual data. Capiche? scene took Fish Called Wanda, fucking hilarious John Cleese movie like America never answered 1918 pandemic started. Oh, sorry. missed silent /s. Dido Harding charge it; getting free credit checks year last time used service ran Harding.

But apparently best MPs wife job. It‚Äôs movie it‚Äôs documentary Here's latest case/death charts trend new cases deaths going quite bit. today Texas 50.68 deaths per 100k population. ranks 19th among US states per capita   fair point. true. countries did, countries not. First everything Seems like forever ago said old account war treated way, got bashed like crazy ""ridiculous"".

This war. can't see it. Honestly depends hospital system patient with, physician goes ordering things, insurance companies approve . Ive found unnecessary stays likely happen minor surgeries profit systems. Part issue systems separate run things little differently never really know getting into. Personally believe insurance person has. IT!!!! Anxiety?

Fuck no, we're smoking massive amounts dope gaming hard.

Been great time really. real disconnect common belief ""Covid didnt kill people, pre-existing conditions did"". boggles mind. belief numbers outright lie. China never answer virus. is.

Except for, y'know - dead Americans ignoring. I'd ashamed American day age. Better Czech wreck  country going downhill...doesn't matter president is. believe problem structure. cracks showing :( things mentioning folded whiteness ontological concept. Yes exclude many people European descent, paradoxically. idea certain people real people real Americans part parcel this. would true people isolated individual pods don't, virus would easily spread within households even everybody isolated perfectly within households would still come side 3 week lockdown.

This whole ""one good lockdown would stop this"" dream like ""if stopped buying gas day"" crap. classic hospital fuck ups, like tubing stomach instead lungs, many cases puncturing them, etc.
Its normal NY hospitals enhanced covid. scientists need show locking save economy, it‚Äôs obvious numbers deaths don‚Äôt impress anyone. People think won‚Äôt family. Remember million? Let's make permanent Wutttt y'all official 2nd wave across pond? sure introverted? Maybe mild introvert.

I bet extroversion one thing's that's distributed bellcurve. people ambiverts. Moderate introverts outnumber extreme introverts. Moderate extroverts outnumber extreme extroverts. GG disagree. don‚Äôt need degree medically intelligent, billions advisors. doctor doesn‚Äôt make good doctor. janitor may know more. Here's latest case/death charts Vermont, running 7-day look pretty great.  Vermont currently 9.29 dead per 100k population. ranks 49th US per capita I'm sick winning... I‚Äôm saying that, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs offensive say assume Hispanics ‚Äústuffed like sardines‚Äù homes Supply infidelity go South Dakota, probably assume exposed. getting pretty bad here. 2nd wave allways inevitable that? Yeah, handful weirdos political opportunists. US straight-up states mask mandate ""muh freedom"". vast, vast majority population issues masks. Again, calling Chinese virus ""racist"". assigning blame country, primarily, CCP government. Nations finger point time. China says US acting belligerent, think singling personally belligerent individual? government?

Regardless, refusing wear masks absolutely nothing racism. fact, guys try tie everything explanation racism, dilute effect. People ignore outrage ""racism"", even justified particular instance, gone Boy Cried Wolf route called everything racist, even related. know get dopamine hit everytime call something racist what, social media folks really understand damage cause rooting actual racism painting everything racism. lose people gain. Stop it. [Dr. Fauci Made Coronavirus Pandemic Worse Lying added Kurt Angle mix? EXACTLY! got pneumonia shot started getting annual flu shot ended hospital three times pneumonia. last time bad almost intubated. Even basically recovered couple weeks. Recovery Covid often months known cause long term side affects. definitely ""just flu"". ultra conservative parents, ultra liberal friends. guess depends are. never targeted message used entirely pointless. targeted messages \*know\* whether work, also ""don't buy cause shortage"", understandable.

Right though, see people portraying masks panacea end pandemic. ""If everyone wears masks, end!"", think dangerous. distancing measures much important (which everything seems suggest) focusing much masks counterproductive. small bit risk compensation people, masks quickly become false security. People areas nontrivial amount spread keeping distance. one region's success stories early strict lockdown imposed March, seen infections soar recent months, first gripping capital Buenos Aires surrounding areas spreading provinces. anger severely misdirected Here's per capita heat map ranking states per capita US per capita average stands 58.53 per 100k population. Right, they're appropriate individual use. they're still effective population studies, particularly want find prevalence last couple months. Spanish study NYC study took place right near sweet spot antibody tests. NYC study problems sampling, really rough measure. Spanish study huge, took place right time, compared results sample antibody tests PCR tests -- using estimates weight antibody results. results strong. 5% population disease March/early April, 15% Madrid.   exception concerts, allowed Ohio well. We're really asking... can't things? hoax trump said beginning. trying say played it. Bullshit, arrogance got way That's right tested total 78 people declared safe ready distribution :P sick winning yet? necessarily seem anti-mask protests Germany, France, Spain I've seen sub. so....when Legend happening ? im stocked ready! Sadly, since million metric measure population US, going pass 1 million many people think it‚Äôs real. next metric 1% US population. particular disdain hospital administration. wife learned valuable lesson: best interest mind. bottom line legal liability put meat grinder helped either priorities. guys ones looking you. Best luck! Yes, main problem dealing countries people charge poison rivals show 5 governors killed tens thousands sending infected elderly back nursing homes took responsibility?

Your comment spread political propaganda actual facts. Perhaps go political sub push bias there. **TL, DR; choice made, result half century industrial policy short term thinking.**



The modern manufacturing base corporations US origin World War II - war manufacturing boomed, due intact industry war post war boom, kept growing. let US develop gigantic base large manufacturing corporations, perfectly specialized single product, still viable due critical mass industry whole.

The huge industrial base US built fading since rest world continued grow US stagnated... part whole ""The US exceptional"" mindset... ""need"" compete more, need treat employees anything fungible resources, need innovate, need plan long term. Industries raised barriers entry via regulatory capture tariffs rather actually competing based quality product cost. 

As stagnation continued, US industries moved manufacturing countries improved bottom line short term.  accelerated decline expertise associated jobs longer maintained US, time possible choose move manufacturing back.

As time passed, large base manufacturing corporations US slowly ate mergers acquisitions, improving bottom line corporations remained, shrinking overall industry developed postwar boom years.

At point, US manufacturing base would rebuilt scratch ""bring manufacturing back"", domination market happened post World War II financed creation growth industries exist more.

So, choice going back was... way forward recognition got here, change corporate management philosophy toward longer term planning growth, short term balance sheets cost. strong leader like Italy, Belgium, Spain, everyone would fine. ""But absolute authority"" prissiness something routine?

Because this. mistrust rises, vaccine acceptance declines. use less half population take vaccine. best way combat mistrust information transparency, point article. 

There enough f-ups handling pandemic. Let's try more. Listen. Vermonters lot advantages. Grocery pharmacy delivery already place thanks huge senior citizen population. get half food weekly farmshare pickups. summer easy, pleasant time stay inside social distance. Lots space. 

Also, prisons states. 

We‚Äôll see winter, it‚Äôs shelter die folks here. I‚Äôm saying want kill old people wanted kill old people would this. Anything outside ""america evil"" narrative gets voted. bizarre. Congratulations guys! I‚Äôve watching fallout news, actually listen - wow... downplay pain, fuck, show someone struggling right now. live state state local governments best pretend wasn‚Äôt happening. still businesses closing right left. unemployment rate worst half national way better now. Edit - it‚Äôs case people money. We‚Äôve chamber commerce ads running radio (I don‚Äôt cable idk TV) since May trying convince us it‚Äôs safe eat out, go mall, etc 

Some elected officials might concerned currying favor party upline reducing virus spread, enough local population took things seriously. eating out, accepting shaggy hair, wearing masks, etc. logic can‚Äôt say second waves put doubt don‚Äôt know second waves occur everywhere places successful lockdowns.

NYC swiftly heading downhill. Hospitals struggling. easy forget bad here.

They air ambulance people one hospital another O2 failed.

They lorries freezers instead morgues. 

Central Park massive pop hospital.

There military boat hospital shipped in.

Lockdown worked people started get scared take seriously. 

The phased reopening also clearly helped compared states said fuck reopen. remember lowest number cdc high think 1.5 million. March 2020-Sep 2020 - sure deaths Feb, vast majority fatalities (that confirmed least) March onwards

As WWII, US got involved late 1941 (Dec) largely wrapped mid-1945 (Japan surrendered end summer, Germany already surrendered end spring) locking now, though? ever lock down? Yeah could import licensed growers states, even, would fine probably.

I think it‚Äôs 6. Yeah, completely get similar sources. consider dad one smartest people know. Hes smarter far. believes her. Hes convinced masks dont help placebo consolation people freaked out.

Granted, maybe dad isnt smart thought, think lot otherwise intelligent people blind trust advisors. im upset. believe government obligated tell truth matters like this, trust blown, lack trust leaks everything else. me, Fauci 79 year old man happens medial virologist. probably late January year, Fauci undoubtedly living totally boring life. 

Suddenly he's thrown world spotlight breakneck speed, media scrutinize, agonize, judge every single word. suppose (I) can't slight error made. anyone whose never exposed inside politicians office let tell something, pressured inundated like believe say want say. excess deaths 100% due COVID? None could caused reaction COVID? great job usa ! like always u first everything...  I've never gotten people holy shit brainwashing insane. streets littered dead people hospitals breaking sweat amount people admitted  yet, China people listened, virus mostly gone now. business open ready competitive world stage. holding pattern 2 years idiots America bothered cooperate. 

China going eating lunch decade. think so. Eventually we‚Äôll treatments effective vaccine, may take years totally get rid think sense normalcy within next 12 months. risk populations remain vigilant protecting think people sense normalcy relatively soon. No, quite normal vaccine. know average percentage detail 14% small complaints seems really good Spain USA! USA! USA! Absolutely not, lower reported numbers Pfizer Oxford. Whether numbers legitimate another question. $1000 robot automatically mow .25 acres. many lawn mowing jobs going cut?

I know guys live, Florida costs $40/month hire someone mow lawn.

Simple math dictates it'll pay 25 months. Ok, let's look pre-existing conditions instead story, still conditions put high risk even get COVID. already 

It‚Äôs street drugs killing people 1918 Spanish Flu killed almost 800 every 100k state New Jersey. length entire pandemic death rate exceeded 1000. current death rate New Jersey 180 per 100k. estimates put IFR COVID 1%, meaning even **everyone** got infected mortality rate would still lower.

Comparing raw numbers country's population 1/3 today idiotic. Ah, another ‚ÄúTreasured Guest‚Äù trying get 15 minutes fame. welcome engage either principle situation allows. However, certain situations one clearly favored. present, find positive COVID test, taking HCQ zinc high dose Vitamin D. life one matter definitive proof year die tomorrow. good. must pursue best available course available information. tired argument me. literally shut entire country country even cases. useless. Yeah sucks aren‚Äôt paid players want play pay stops them. Yeah got argument guy March would gone three months.

He's overall nice guy, smart, want call it, yeah. Yeah don‚Äôt think either, could wrong. Either way, people dying normal. Covid not, something killing them. Never mind. can't handle logic.  case vaccine. guess people already go ahead live normally possible? mean, US, large amount already think hoax. cant see many people continue social distance year. sure world looks like then. Yet trying discredit fact 5 governors sent infected elderly back nursing homes killed tens thousands.

I see connection president all....even though want be.

If pro human race 5 governors actions issue you? Believe not, mediocre roads still great country. country people literally dying get quality life great. 

No one judges america based roads lol. People come country, start family, start business build life saying ""but roads terrible, let's leave"" Instead much better put onus everyone? ok drive young people depression. Make homeless lose jobs due harsh public health measures?

Obviously describing mask wearing. gangrene way point stands. ‚ÄúContributing‚Äù ‚Äúcausing‚Äù different nonetheless hard prove. It‚Äôs complex wanted say. Old guy new congestive heart failure found aortic stenosis. cause heart failure? contribute amongst many factors? incidental finding? can‚Äôt always know exact causal link, especially chronic asymptomatic diseases. black white view COVID political damaging wondering anyone actually bothered 1) read article 2) look *name* organization employing individual.

Yes, absolutely correct; distribution logistics much world (particularly central Asia, SE asia, subsaharan Africa) going take time. patently absurd think going long developed world; anyone genuinely believes probably needs sit one out. bad case swine flu cause cytotoxic storm kills people. deadly COVID, still bad Stay bars! bars even open? might stupid-arsed question, population density taken consideration countries covid data?  Fuck yourself. sound like perfectly normal vaccination side effects. prediction deaths would August right? spot on.

There thousand different predictions early on. bound correct. We‚Äôre number one! USA! üá∫üá∏ Imagine caving Donald Trump scientists. Imagine killing students community members Trump hurt feelings tweet. One first things learn business school don‚Äôt know someone else‚Äôs books look like. make observations draw conclusions. conclusion local business owners becoming increasingly desperate, based observing recklessness. must running debt now.

I already enough debt like thanks, I‚Äôll pay (well, most) back eventually, facts contradict themselves? two things true. only. Chances idiots survived deaths collateral damage. work ass off, I‚Äôd still go debt something tragic happened ended hospital. Insurance companies much.

Your original comment talking nobody cares people don‚Äôt get healthcare need, fact reason people don‚Äôt get health care need expensive country turn around say this.

You‚Äôre one doesn‚Äôt care, people care 200,000 deaths country coronavirus ones care people aren‚Äôt getting health care deserve.  Unlikely Im convinced perspective. mean article wrong...does anyone really expect go Coachella 100,000 randos rage face without masks 2021? Absolutely fucking not. 

2022 shit (most likely) normal, like full attendance sporting events, concerts, people going bars without masks.  Take care well. know Thanksgiving big challenge lot people imagine one typically hosts it.

The fact know long term ramifications least make people wary. may anything could something substantial. Dealing unknowns learning fly fun at. also makes easier make decisions much right now. many Americans need experience something first hand believe it? doesnt take highly educated person realize one bad apple away turning New York Italy. 

East Asia shut shit down. we? masks common sense favorite Trump ridicule ? lack common sense ? guy ? Defend still now? Would insecure racists able feel superior though?

 

Think asking. Turns Uyghurs people aren‚Äôt amount genocide Colored kids? 2020 1720? Yeah, facts contradicting themselves. call right.. get used it. means countries ordered vaccine rolls out. US, Europe China back normal much then. build factories! Make vaccines synthetic, much easier mass produce. really. less Nordic Countries. (Except Norway, probable Oil prices dropping)

But one third jobs Sweden based Global Exports. Considering entire world besides locked down. going get severe hit economy.

But domestic economy fared bit better neighboring countries. clear struggling damage virus bodies, active long term infection itself. No, wrong spreading false we'd end amount deaths

You talking herd immunity, would Winter coming Probably Canadians vaccinated...  headline really deceiving. think important line article mistrust government vaccine: ""half plans getting vaccine."" Actually, new title article... Please stop! can't stand winning much!

/s Hopefully. can't developing country regressing.  small group people NA large portion worlds wealth. Many Americans better many people developing countries. 

I know many ppl Kazakhstan better many Americans. Add ""excess deaths"" column.  didn‚Äôt lie though. Show did? ""Stop this"" supposed goal, realistic.

It's shame local state leaders took upon make goal. help, still deaths many cases, killed economy destroyed people's lives process.

""Flatten curve"" ""not let hospitals get overwhelmed"" goal, least supposed be. We've accomplished goal. hospitals overwhelmed since original Northeast breakout virus Well, got ones declared Covid-free NZ still fighting new outbreaks Fauci's statements masks little political expediency, (and others WH, CDC, etc) concerned hoarding. First comment starts ""Your 100% correct"" upvotes. comment downvoted. 

Totally agree comment. 

Let's see get upvotes get downvotes. I'm moving Nunavut immediately. ""Yeah, well, downplay it. actually, many ways, up-played it, terms action. action strong.‚Äù Wonder we're going pass Europes 213k+, sure since EU seeing resurgence.

fuck shit NZ still locked down? Seems absurd lock whole country handful cases. glad panic. I've heard arguments numbers made up. point, know say change someone's mind. Europe country. Yay! country continuing make history! /s 

Ok seriousness. sad. amount leaves massive hole stomach think back old woman gave life support stuff away another young person cause said lived long happy life. Anyone please stay safe clean.  thinking possible keep deaths 200K

Well, *possible*, proper steps taken. I'm sure we've passed 250k actual numbers covered up. Donald said 9,000. sell propane living think may telling us lies.  ~ 1/2 US WWII deaths 
~1/3 Civil War deaths trying put roses turd? 

Not using major historical events measured terms percentage pop. examples make COVID look perceptibly worse. 

Yes, unfathomable number deaths either way, trying use *perceived* magnitude life lost WW2/civil war give weight perceived loss life COVID, unfair comparison perception loss (historical) events generally understood percentage population time. Everyone knows that, hence using example - make look like covid bigger impact humanity terms life lost total life. 

We normalising it, say, argument purely communicate problem - discount gravity it. used percentages, would honest discussion ourselves, would leave little argument things like this, people going pick count whole comparison sensationalised worth taking board. set record straight begin understand we're dealing with? arguing statistics interpreted. ideally page data concerned least. bastards! considerations account, little evidence suggest spread SARS-CoV-2 might stop naturally least 50% population become immune.

All anecdotal, still. vocal minority here. say ""COVID 6% reported death rate"". 6% people COVID died died COVID alone. already mentioned, number would higher factor conditions COVID may caused carrier contract, frame coronavirus killed 200 thousand like people thread blatantly misleading. tally *all* respiratory complications involved coronavirus deaths 182,005. tally complications *310,681.* 200K die coronavirus even assume every single respiratory complication caused it. hoorayy party time, new high scoreü•≥ü•≥. headed next?? 6 million seems like overestimation. Yeaaah, [H1N1 found much deadly first reported, 10-fold number using even confirmed cases. tally deaths way, H1N1 killed people US. 

You sound like someone brainwashed leftist media.

Too bad can't rewrite history recordings easily imagine go exam/test doctor comes room results: ""We got test back certain yet going die soon. tests though confirm actually sick. It'll take couple days get results back"". Compare to: ""we got test back might something need take another look at. might something, might be. need run additional tests know"". know one I'd time governor requested assistance, they've gotten it. Ships, beds, ventilators, test kits, PPE. They've praised turned political.

Trump make virus. Trump spread it. Trump send sick people nursing homes. Cuomo directly responsible least 11,000 deaths  People living Victoria understand severity contagiousness disease. believe science. Wearing mask social distancing makes sense.

Blanket bans businesses makes zero sense. businesses allowed operate could spread virus easily (eg crowded markets) vs others forced shut likely close zero chance contributing spread (eg landscaper working own). Victorian economy suffer greatly. 

The state government responsible outbreak getting control, see ""Hotel Quarantine state government locked residents two housing commision towers heavy policing. complete waste resources. 

These resources used protect vulnerable, elderly. Yet state government failed again. could implemented measures protect nursing home/aged care residents, yet basically nothing effective.

You make digital decisions something requires fine tuning. 

As Victorian, I'm sorely disappointed state government Victoria.  Thanks appreciate link perspective! True. suppose can't sure much Americans reduced social interaction. However, densely populated states serious covid restrictions, seems like go...down.   stop testing lol What‚Äôs deal masks? wearing masks supermarket? don‚Äôt get that. least protect workers there. 

I think mask stuff go far sometimes whatever. instance Palm Springs couple weeks ago signs everywhere (which look local city council) say masks required everywhere even outdoors. First off, 115 degrees hardly anyone outside. Requiring mask usage outside beyond absurd. makes sense high density cities desert communities. saw woman walking dog mask fucks sake. 

The time wear mask go indoors either supermarket post office. Hell got married covid county office wife said vows masks. took kiss. fine county clerk also room.

Same deal mom. tried asking percentage thinks fake covid cases regardless number US still one highest death counts, pretty much ignored question still wants believe count mostly faked. 

Though, case think wanting accept could bad combined fact seeing middle where, know anyone covid, experienced like else where. hope wash hands regularly general grumpy moment...if not, yikes.

Seems like choosing myopic go-to coping mechanism getting going work immoral egregores everyday. long time, obviously terrible Covid. Okay well research showing otherwise. news report, primary analysis sewage one Virginia county indicates 10 times many people walking around coronavirus test results suggest.

who conducted officials said sewage data doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean many said sewage data indicate whether cases increasing.

so county says necessarily mean thing using proof for.

I really wonder yall bother read links yall share.  I'd definitely rather go extra mile make masks effective (frequent washing, better quality/fit, avoid touching/readjusting) keep I've doing.  Damn. RIP. skepticism unfounded.

Anyone knows answer? Ask relatives explain excess deaths year. mean...

And could everything internally rather coordinating multiple entities, like Jenner institute AstraZeneca / Serum Institute done telling people endangering others (and myself). I'll happily deputise though. Things get better time, world personally. gotta get one day we'll looking back this! regulate it. yeah, free country nobody wants socialism. Instead much better put onus everyone? ok drive young people depression. Make homeless lose jobs due harsh public health measures?

We choice making things harder everyone, minority. 

Please cite studies permanent damage COVID people age say 40?  so? TIL stating facts scary.

We've known covid19 kill young people. superspreaders, tis all. nobody wants US. Honestly could favourite 

Compared countries USA worse (i'm saying bad). looks way bigger countries produce bigger numbers. 200,000 deaths (US) sounds lot worse 41,000 (UK) deaths, statistically speaking same.

Death Rates : 
US - 0.06% 
UK - 0.06% 
Brazil - 0.06% 
France - 0.59% 
Italy - 0.059%

Other countries done exceptionally well: 
South Korea - 0.0007% 
Japan - 0.001% 
Germany - 0.01% 
Israel - 0.01%

Kudos Japan, Israel South Korea low death rates considering top 25 densely populated countries world. 40% Americans think issue. Even think solves problem Instead rockaway, lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back USA USA USA USA really compare important economy ^/s understand bipartisan system actual cancer easy influenced manipulated organizations, exactly reason main policies harmful remain matter party lead. (unpopular opinion) flu jab Unfortunately many many mainland Chinese view overall CCP force good. seems hold true even studying abroad, rarely holds true stay graduation. 

What even surprising [85% Chinese population](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/834000.shtml) thinks Mao Zedong force good ""More 90 percent respondents believe Mao's era still influences today's China."" Tbf levels 3 &amp; 4 lockdowns - i.e. stay home/largely home. Levels 1 &amp; 2 (and 2.5) lockdown, rules restrictions around social distancing, gatherings etc. say, pretty tame, cause go day otherwise long observe those.

Sorry use lockdown describe level 2 bit bug bear mine atm. That's two 9/11s every week. apparently never really cared people killed back then, excuse destroy privacy remove rights invade nations. Covid let blame nations care dead ""it is"" Technically think anyone free leave pretty much first-world country allowing Americans visit, might one two that's point roads mediocre straight terrible supposedly awesome country continually calls greatest country earth. moved away quality life billion comments ago. ones Hazmat suits eh ones digging. guys green background grave diggers. ones Hazmat suits eh ones digging. guys green background grave diggers. seem continually miss point.

-Fauci special sort idiot think Trump followed sort science. wish local governments ability instead federal aid. would great local communities resources locally. actual number probably approaching 300k now. 

By 15th August, CDC reports \~250k excess deaths since 1st March. 

In last month, we've reporting 6k/week. adjust under-reporting, that's \~36k since 15th August. So, we're probably \~280k still reporting 5k/week.

What shit show that? mean started trade war allies? Wait Trump. tried kick 20 million Americans health insurance? put tens thousands migrants concentration camps performed unnecessary surgery them? Oh right, ALSO GOP. 

WHAT SHIT SHOW? 

The horrible way everyone left appalled behavior right? way dems absolute gall try hold President accountable oath office.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* draconian national lockdown really paid off. Let remind children allowed outside 2 months needed written authorisation outside... said, ""It's [the Democrats'] newest hoax."" Yes mask wearing.

Oh damn. People want wear masks. Considering even full year yet disease still running rampant, flu season even, entirely possible comment going age like milk. like beginning disease people dismissed another cold. Remember models showed 60k deaths America? Clearly going us long haul, happens couple months even next summer still anybodys guess. One co-workers, physician assistant actually great one, also believes this. baffling. splash sauce numbers civil war ww2 please? downplay conflicts real pandemic, see coming from. Estimates [civil seem bit higher numbers. Accuracy facts important cant used people meaning discredit severity current situation ie- ""look numbers arent even right things""  BRAWNDO know bad case flu 2009 took good 2 months get back feeling normal enough exercise like previously. actually Omega Man. Look up. This. Fuck off. know nothing people persecuted there. family dirt poor. going happen.

You going get people like (old, discretionary income) leave house go restaurant theory that, *all* get sick, life pretty good survivors.

To kick-start economy, need consumers. fairly large percentage consumers want get sick. None numbers going convince *just try it*. 

People like swim shark-infested waters either. like stand high places lightning storms. like drive night without headlights. Unsurprisingly, can't convince people personally endanger lives interest group solidarity.

You never convince someone like hang unmasked strangers bar store. long assholes masks hanging one ear chin, staying home.

Like, going shop stores ""Black Friday"". Without shopping power people like me, economy can't recover, plan herd immunity, count out. leaked audio Woodward Trump proved point briefed intellegence agencies dangerous yet downplays it. hurricane tsunami coming bombs enemy president duty protect warn Americans straight lied. People like medical community pharmacist knew lying actually masks best tool moment. still hasn‚Äôt ramped mask production defense act touting witch doctors hydroxychloroquine joke. sent masks every American along onetime stupid check. headed shit storm November flu season election cause civil unrest crisis matter wins. Meanwhile China laughing us collapse without firing shot. Would even warn us nukes inbound asteroid? doubt it. Trump‚Äù spoke NASA asteroid go away summer nothing worry about. NASA great way big shiny rockets powerful, big shiny powerful rockets, believe me!‚Äù SMH You‚Äôre missing point. little underestimated. lied healthcare workers masks use. knew along masks effective. going saying effective hurt reputation, hurt use masks long run, still hear people saying CDC said masks useless, dont wear masks. Vermont good spot. It‚Äôs densely populated residents actually heed advice public health experts. Many US would vehemently prefer believe China made virus. way, US could go war China.

Americans (perhaps even majority) would far prefer go war accept science says comport simple public health measures.

As much pandemic cost, going war would cost lives trillions dollars we‚Äôd ***still virus, too***.

The current office holder reelected major War president? ... Good Lord, people, stop!!! Social distancing going last another year either. Sorry. asking question. I. Michigan started allowing visitors nursing homes yesterday. fan. read it. makes 0 sense. argument terrible. 

Roads priority you. blaming others actions, inactions, Trump. get it, get it, takes responsibility completely useless irrelevant.

He never shut travel China. let 50,000 people point coming Europe. that‚Äôs lie. ventilator shortage never paid attention stockpile. still massive shortage PPE President never anything that.

He downplayed it, called hoax, encouraged people break orders isolate, encouraged spread virus, got tens thousands people dead. spread misinformation, debunked lies, wild conspiracy theories based science, takes absolutely responsibility anything still don‚Äôt national plan, heading deadly time season. we? recall lot pushback powers DC regarding masks. Winning - Donald Dumpf Remember ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu‚Äù? kind predictions even know much immunity last, effectiveness vaccine, etc? mom married Cuban family racist lunatics. large Cuban expat community FL main reason it‚Äôs one worse states live in. Countries like China, South Korea Japan made masks mandatory, explains significantly fewer cases Europe Americas. Hong Kong (where I'm from) less 700 cases per million people. UK enters room Toronto.

I told wear mask day one. Ontario make wearing mask law months later.

But always told masks extremely vital protecting virus. Wash hands, Wear mask. No, lockdowns economy still fucked. People scared getting  USA! USA! USA! know could vaccinate type cancer! haha quoting ""i responsible anything"". will. Last years flu season lower usual due social distancing starting, southern hemispheres flu season practically non-existent. Literally next line paragraph gist paper authors believe genome displays ""suspicious"" sequences suggest problems argument. straightforward explanation ""suspicious"" genetic traits natural recombination coronaviruses. like influenza, two different coronaviruses infect animal (or human) time, gene sequences swapped. result, new virus pops completely unique gene sequence. Then, like everything else, virus undergoes natural selection. gene sequence helps virus spread, virus selected evolutionary forces. WOOOOO NUMBER 1 BITCHES. ‚ÄòMERICA! Business especially blame pushed it. There‚Äôs really debate anymore, president says private. February. true once. someone works homeless population almost every day, nah. None abilities COVID-19 has. beginning understand crossing blood/brain barrier here. Micro thrombosis endothelial damage unprecedented. People understand lasting impacts infection avoided strict mask use. Fuck, went 3 day backpacking trip. cleared feel completely fine. Hope screw myself. factories moved congress nothing it. top consumer, matter much preach ""buy American"", still go way buy American made products. suck :,( mean shutdown nonessential business people stay home (a.k.a. Shutdown) mean literal lockdown (people can't leave homes without good reason)? That's world difference.

Also \*America\* needs lock down? That's like saying \*Europe\* lock now. places nearly spread, places uncontrolled spread. Locking places spread would dumbest thing ever.

Adding mitigations \*when\* needed \*where\* needed key people accept mitigations, turn key maintainable effective. Sweden‚Äôs experience shown, reaching threshold long-drawn 

Is insinuating kind attempt ""reaching herd immunity"" Sweden? saying? US LOT dead Sweden (25% including excess), think look US ""experience"" draw conclusions. sudden loss balance near windows? rare semi-rare side effect?    You‚Äôre definitely wrong flu stats. worst flu season since 2013 12K confirmed flu-related deaths US alone (and *estimate based verified count* around 60K actually died year).

But even even vaccine, COVID-19 remain much serious problem Influenza. Covid-19 kills lot people without comorbidities. People rarely die ‚Äújust flu.‚Äù It‚Äôs lot common die ‚Äújust COVID-19.‚Äù It‚Äôs science anymore it‚Äôs politics remember libs got 200000+ people play dead along rest world. /s (it's sad even need type /s)

Register vote, volunteer, vote. Bars remain closed 2 99 counties state, Story (Iowa State University) Johnson (Iowa U) there's silver lining - flu [almost entirely shut southern hemisphere, thus likely also North winter.

I still got shot though fuck panicing cough turns flu.  ...or even getting time. all, like flu makes immune covid. anti-masker chief ""running "" country...

Or maybe Pandemic team abolished might prepared lets say pandemic!

edit: added last sentence Thanks, good know there's silver lining - flu [almost entirely shut southern hemisphere, thus likely also North winter.

I still got shot though fuck panicing cough turns flu.  ...or even getting time. all, like flu makes immune covid. new info change death toll. feels like think gotcha moment. People underlying conditions still people brushed off.  Same. I'm Florida we're once""the epicenter"". Hospitals fine life almost back normal. less 0.5% increase new cases / deaths per day. county dropped high ~3000 active cases level ~1000 even though bars restaurants open limited seating mask mandates. bc separately mean anything. Virtually entire country shutdown exact time  there's silver lining - flu [almost entirely shut southern hemisphere, thus likely also North winter.

I still got shot though fuck panicing cough turns flu.  ...or even getting time. all, like flu makes immune covid. remember coworker saying something like ""What hell wrong Italy? They've always dirty, poorly-run country guess death toll surprising."" found words offensive, also secretly wondered really major issues culture healthcare system contributed spread. retrospect, think actually pretty good job, considering little everyone knew virus time.  Sure. 

I relaying personal story. 

Maybe coincidental timing example redditor idea they're talking about.

Ironic There's nothing read. whole article one page devoid facts.  can't leave president fucked much.  go? banned Americans? Okay trust him. Trust literally every country mask mandate lower infection rates us. used like that, miss there's silver lining - flu [almost entirely shut southern hemisphere, thus likely also North winter.

I still got shot though fuck panicing cough turns flu.  ...or even getting time. all, like flu makes immune covid. KNEW ducks ruled world! Here's hoping feathery friends stay healthy!  know unlikely created laboratory. possible disprove wasn‚Äôt brought laboratory leak it? seems unlikely would originate Wuhan, many bats.. would burn faster rate actually. stretch longer. lockdowns; economy still tatters places without lockdowns. can't honestly expect regular people middle active pandemic think, ""sure may get seriously ill maybe even make family seriously ill, need ignore live normal life sake economy."" People always going look protect first, decisions like eating naturally going change. 'I'm bored, lets go store' naturally going change. Going events naturally going change. 

Most people going apply cold logic accepting deaths, including deaths families, making personal decisions.  absolutely true. exactly that. Ian Lipkin already said ""this week virology"" March (if remember correctly) studies importance masks didnt want bring discourse supply problem medical sector. 

The best thing could done would tell truth tell people sew use scarves.

Now every conspiracy nut fodder stupid stories. lies politicians feed us make us feel alone betrayed. wonder people getting pissed confused. Hey bud, thanks. mean that.

Please continue wearing mask, still spread various strains since know many - means lot us vulnerable. less people trumps inauguration? want Covid-19 memorial DC over. one Vietnam, WWI, WWII, one thing killed many Americans? Trump lackeys likely intervention, number probably underreported. fault. US. Cannot fathom anyone wanting immigrate US now... say things Trump virus. Trump downplayed this, intentionally lied people, downplayed wearing masks, let spread first happening ‚Äúliberal‚Äù states, didn‚Äôt care murderer, plain simple.

Yes. shoved throat willingly swallowed it

Look actions policies. Quickly shut travel China. supposed ventilator shortage, never happened. Supposed shortage beds, sent medically equipped ships states basically never used. Supposed PPE shortage, look like case. on..

What actions policies President causes spread virus? actions policies President caused virus kill people? policy Gov Cuomo linked least 11k deaths nursing homes. Trump also responsible deaths? taking count? mean trumps toilet paper?

Seriously, concentration camps ice doctors sterilizing women.  nazis name. 

And criminals, they're peaceful people seeking asylum instead turned away arrested!  country shit hole stop defending recognize need serious reforms. People like turning blind eye atrocities commited elected officials. covid garden\* This. manufacturing base necessary defense, wackos want us shift production back basic commodities switch gold standard asking depression. Netherlands even wear masks, except public transport. government says ""it's proven effective"". 

Real nice, shops supermarkets, 75% people keep distance...  is. heat helps people outside heat. reason saw high case numbers summer places like Florida, Texas, Arizona, California people inside air conditioning since hot outside know virus spreads easier indoors. influenza 100 years ago went away heat air conditioning retreat to. think means everyone going die someday. older person dying still tragic, particularly person's family, course. less tragic younger person dying unexpectedly.

No one wants die. one wants mom die. Yet someone's mom 80 90 years old son/daughter know lot time left.  influenza attacks epithelium? understand ARDS. Damaged lungs yes. Cytokine storm sure. Fucking insane clotting...nope. Hey guys question thats kinda confusing me. One friends caught covid back July, antibody testing. 

Is still capable carrier? example roommate currently covid, mean also required quarantine despite antibodies? able actively carry spread virus? MUCH WINNING really rest peace.

Yeah, even young (like, 13 14) got swine flu, *still* knocked ass month. fucking brutal.  hate argument, look original sars. also thought originated bats, via civet cats, outbreak started Guangzhou equally far bats home. Yes got flu shot despite taking ibuprophen, upper arm sore two days. years get side effect, years not. worth it? billion times yes. think likely someone infected Lab.. know incubation period... kept going market across street unknowingly spreading virus time.. spread around area well people interacted virus/ animals market.

Just theory. totally plausible Maybe close highest ever been. CoV strains seasonal component, safe assume also. 

Winter coming... There's Would agree said patients late stage dementia many years live, going 6 months without contact half rest lives? turn ill, strain healthcare system (because they'd given advanced care). perhaps given hug, even small risk dying it?

It's 60- 70 year olds isolated. decades lose. 90 year olds failing health may spending last year alone. We're giving best, thanks encouraging interaction site rare. started morning well :-) Remarkably Taiwan immediately recognized need masks, government subsidized significant increase production capacity turn kept everyone employed evolved new export opportunities.  closed state borders anyone road getting fined unless carrying proof essential? that's mean full shutdown, agree. I'd added cruise ships allowed offload California, outside country vacation visiting family Chinese New Year, bad. 

No entry country individual states 3 weeks would winning plan. Full reopen mask mandates fines without jeopardizing reopening. quarantine facilities set positive. Entire hospitals one permitted unless positive. Absolutely quarantined workers full isolation gear upon entry facility. Clean hospitals dirty hospitals, clean nursing homes dirty nursing homes. (Using infectious disease ward slang) Florida real estate fire. going go, might well cash now. One reasons myocarditis particularly hard evaluate is, even aside baseline cardiac MRI findings, hard determine whether seeing certain T1 T2 signal actually *myocarditis*. That's one biggest problems recent studies myocarditis 2/2 COVID-19 (even aside problem overdiagnosis) -- authors showed individuals signal cardiac MRIs, simplify bit -- supportive evidence support diagnosis myocarditis, definitive diagnosis therein.

There's good piece effect cards journal published recently makes points succinctly: cases counted towards Covid deaths excess death.

Make will.

Every death elderly homes period time counted towards covid deaths even one person infected.

Those places lot people dying. Gotta give rich much time possible diversify mitigate damage inevitable crash Doctors nurses healthcare workers get masks first. said N95s HCWs everyone else wearing cloth masks _and_ provide specifications cloth masks (how many layers, kind material, etc). know, things eventually figured own.  Talk radio worst. contractor yard yesterday playing conservative radio. ""They're leftists. They're murderers. hate life hate death."" said that. Live. radio. What?!?! bizarre. It‚Äôs official. 

We greatest. WTF talking about. New footages show China wearing mask right start. Blaming dumbass antimaskers foreign propagenda insane. things like schools session, school college sports back on, trick treating Halloween (and holiday) parties coming up...

We're going see spike soon. think maybe reason sub removes word? Possibly misleading, insulting, reflects damaging set government policies ever enacted

Oh really? Staying home weeks damaging than, say, forced hysterectomies asylum seekers?

Quarantine work, people adhere rules. Quarantine old civilization. mentioned bible. course works. work time half nation take seriously, obviously lack leadership. Quarantine worked fine countries, put pandemic behind back business.

It policy ineffective. unpatriotic attitude people refused cooperate destroyed effectiveness quarantine.

Shame people. brought country low. really wish people would stop comparing estimated death counts actual verified death counts. people comparing flu numbers covid numbers making hugely flawed comparisons. taking actual verified covid deaths comparing estimated flu deaths. 

But difference actual verified flu deaths estimated flu deaths **by factor ~5**. people say ‚Äúwe 60k flu deaths year,‚Äù need divide 60k ~5 get actual verified flu death count compare actual verified covid death count year (~12K).

We really need estimated covid death count that‚Äôs estimated like flu is, won‚Äôt see number least 2 years road.


Source: [this disturbing graph made comparing verified death counts two made claim. burden proof you. NuMBeRS InfLAtEd! 10k DiED CoVId! &lt;5% world's population deaths. Clearly, ignoring thing living life like normal going work.

We're connected country, highly urbanized, almost impossible lock down. remotely surprising lots cases. also first-world country better reporting practices majority world. really trust Russia's COVID numbers? Zimbabwe's? addition death numbers comparable countries like UK, France, Sweden, Belgium, Italy, Spain. Europe magically make safe COVID. Lastly cases spiking across developed world governments refuse shut back down. shut countries ""doing right"" long covid threat, people going go shopping like used economy going recover. 

As long arbitrarily shut businesses create mandates actively push away customers, economy going way contain virus, start repairing economy.

No. That's holding economy hostage arbitrary goalposts. [The goals clearly shifted since idea could eliminate virus fabricated, became new goal. Gov. Newsom essentially said refuses reopen California cases reach impossibly low levels. go standards ""experts"" /r/coronavirus, nothing left reopen finally reach arbitrary goalposts 2023.  Anyone know children figure COVID vaccine trials? guess children would get vaccine, children participating trials? percentage infected covid live rest life disabled? Wait thought Coumo wanted kill old people? wonder Kemp receive criticism people... obvious, difficult get past? oh I'm American change opinion anything, regardless facts presented me.

They absolutely right, would put doctors nurses even worse spot regarding getting PPE. saw happened toilet paper.  Make sure accidentally lick poop! Chips vaccine track US citizens/s Nobody disputing that. looked conferences keep fans players safe

Which interesting since Europe people  


So per capita, US worse  People die minute dude, we‚Äôre mortal. ain‚Äôt got time emotional fortitude internalize devastating is. I‚Äôd depressed tried. 

And so, is. Well movie/theater business restaurants etc finding even allowed open millions people going expose covid hell it. read article posted believe day said eat restaurants, chances getting covid go big. See here: 

[Adults COVID-19 Twice Likely Eaten Restaurants, CDC Study yeah things go back 'normal' states federal govt get fucking serious covid! That's racist Reuters publishes reports countries stuff. pro-communist propaganda seems highlighted reddit Sort of. excess deaths interesting statistic sure. since average person US dying sars-cov-2 2.6 comorbidities number deaths misattributed specifically covid likely much much larger dying covid home without testing. Imagine nothing offer except critiques style. Go runways Milan Paris that's important N95 aren‚Äôt even effective N100 are! Trump's family Germany? never bought wife medicine understood PPE crisis.

It dumb thing suggest nothing lose encouraging homemade masks early. bandana coffee filters inside Bernie Sanders still holding person rallies.  fact clear history zoonotic origin lethal coronavirus outbreaks [SARS-CoV job prove claim I'll link results google title article ""Is Coronavirus Death Tally Inflated? Here‚Äôs Experts Say American article debunking Republican claims Covid numbers article conservatives came believe conspiracy theory ""covid death counts inflated"".

Those first 3 relevant American results - rest countries.

**So, still actual source talking ass**

You also know searching something bias obviously bring biased results. wanted impartial probably googled something like ""total US coronavirus deaths""

If thought anyone win lose debate many people dead pandemic, I'd feel pretty ashamed. Also anyone thinks 200k dead people biggie deserves called names. Probably he's still claiming ""just go away"" never really stopped. replace 0 sub removes posts word spelled correctly.

In words, intentionally, knowledge aforethought, breaking sub rules. simply asking proponent damaging set government policies ever enacted demonstrate justification effectiveness.

What kind evidence would deem acceptable? - consider Texas LAGS overall testing rates vs average entire USA nearly 40% less, situation likely much worse growing Sweden amongst countries. Remember, masks available. France lockdown could get masks, hand gel rationed. post sarcasm. haven‚Äôt even million deaths Covid whole world statistics probably made people publishing fake Covid-data Sweden /s refutation? hearing things want hear denial?

Could someone science background explain implausible lab could able recombine play around various gene sequences virus accidentally leaked out. don‚Äôt think majority claim virus fully lab engineered; clearly seems unlikely (and article arguing against). one tell difference whether specific recombinations took place via natural routes, artificial ones? fact still can‚Äôt find ancestor trail virus origin seems strange. virus origins traced back sources, no? understanding viruses don‚Äôt change overnight like own, something nobody trace back. enforces that? quite ""easy"" require it.

Such great response!  


/s   Youre right, look exactly same. 


edited talking nearly 80 year old mom saw doctor week told week (!!!!!!!!!!!) ""just like flu"".... omg .... told um it'll hit 200K week.... WTF doctors telling patients ""just like flu""??? US winning now? Usa numbah one! typical Boeing 737-MAX carries 204 passengers maximum capacity. 

COVID-19 killed nearly 1,000 Boeing 737-MAX aircraft FULL people. 

Also note - second crash Boeing 737-MAX (having loss &lt;600 people), US government grounded aircraft type, remain grounded now, year later. Remember Trump talked opening everything Easter great would make feel?  legitimately saw someone use excuse yesterday. underestimate aggressive ignorance. No, comes China. Yeah, already provided study even look ""waste"". Around 2012/2013 studies began come concluding death toll H1N1 way off. count deaths like Covid19 (example: died blood clot/aneurysm/heart attack _might_ covid we're calling covid death) death toll H1N1 US estimated 200-400k people still say rules complex. start giving exemptions certain activities people expect exemptions. 4 reasons leaving house makes rules easy follow. 

Perfect enemy good.  wife went Olive Garden august... next day announced recent exposure exact one day went.  really know. kind doubt financial incentive reporting covid deaths,but really know.

 also seriously doubt people witnessed making claim know much anything. telling everybody know though, reported blown proportion. ""Ask truly believe""  bat shit crazy conspiracy theories. soon India reach 100k soon total covid deaths would sure hit 1 mil 2 weeks. guys, looking Vietnam Mongolia?  


They shamed near EVERYone. ""simply lose weight"" RemindMe! 1 Year Italy passed deadlier US essentially utter bullshit weeks' span.  work going trough scientific papers without prior knowledge (because never stated pretended scientist), I'm going free. also last checked reddit popularity contest serious -_- difference cure vaccine though get sick cure work. Therefore you‚Äôll never get rid disease. even know start this. troll? obviously say kids well behaved, I'd guess average intelligence, although hard fortell age, work hard. struggles different areas work areas. see that's bad thing. One kids ADHD, can't say struggle sit still home school. least home there's kids talking lesson, distractions 30 kids around even talking! There's issues methods teaching. Sure things equal I'd love go school friends, risks in-school teaching high right now.

Of course people struggling. Struggling different degrees sure. think ""everyone else"" struggling. see hear rich struggling. struggling they're struggling designer ""fashion mask"" tell maid buy. disagree there.

But bottom line is, even struggles even issues kids schooling concerns getting educated without falling behind, nothing, NOTHING worth sacrificing human lives! However, Corona **claim many lives simply [prevention treatment] **lower deaths**

 contradictory statements Two wrongs make right BOYO chronic viral pleurisy, year half took another year feel like get 280,000 100x 9/11 death toll. I'm sick reductionist mentality going everywhere! Red vs blue, left vs right, cities vs rural, educated vs uneducated.

Usually think sub doom gloom, every comment acting like lockdowns 121 deaths almost 200k deaths among older people? normal people getting flu last 40 years suddenly experiencing covid. really think post you? Basically two numbers, total infections (which italy sits 289 990) active infections (which italy sits 39712). 289 990 pretty much never go (except bad data entry) yesterday sat 288 761. matter whether recover die, always number. 

The second number, article talks active infections, people tested positive recent times tested negative again, people hospital quarantine likely. number though go down. Italy's peak number sat 100 000, vast majority people recovered died number went down.

But new people still getting infected go 0 (I doubt many active infections active infections April). key people past several months recovered gotten ill fell 100k 35-39k. yesterday people got infected (1229) recovered died (704) number active infected went 525. NJ NY got hit hard doubt major spikes like test US. like Europe, learned, believe say fuck allowing again. rest IDK. hundred thousand dead, what's big deal, right?

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs k-k-k-Ken, coming k-k-k-kill me!‚Äù Lol went ER doctor LLC billed separately, along X-ray company, first responders, hospital itself. Putin rest world must loving this! We're number 1, we're number 1! He's wrong though. putting things perspective. Sometimes hard please people. criticize Republicans Democrats alike blaming virus others, next thing know, accuse blame Trump. Cuomo Trump.  wrong. ban anyone set foot China last 14 days. 


Furthermore, earliest known European case even Chinese? French person got mid Dec travel even know got from.   Bingo. include pnuemonia flu deaths yearly average, closer half million. Many people died could tested labeled thing could proven time: pnuemonia. Shit! No, please stop... can't take anymore. dont understand point canceling they? mean cancel it, clear people wouldnt voluntarily refrain first place. actively downplayed virus public refused act privately acknowledging deadliness. fast quotes believe Trump said coronavirus. He's said lot stupid shit corona, that. Truth. Also hellfire new york, sneezed heart attack, deemed covid. Yeah, people say that‚Äôs stress wearing masks, joke. Karen still saying real fighting freedom breathe. should. He‚Äôs also paying protesters (and dogs!) Europe last several years. (Payed go protest)

You can‚Äôt make shit up, yet puzzling :( curious thought, virus able inflict much damage US, enemies US turn biological warfare future. Sure US unparalleled army, bother go war virus able job even better. dangerous thought Goin forward part, boost 500,000 :) Give example something think president held responsible for, bungling pandemic response that's killed 200,000 people swore serve protect. Filter deaths Aug 1, 97. Sum Death due illness actually lower. Unless I'm missing something Well either scientists know they‚Äôre way many people die year kind stuff, American people unwilling change insanely unhealthy habits. wish coverage unhealthy America real dialogue changing lifestyles Jesus christ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm sure incorrect, read finding strain Boston strain spread Europe, China. people infected Boston infected Europe, China.

I surprised infections China across rest US; know read Boston Asymptomatic rate estimated 50%. see anywhere close 25M people symptoms. dad saying fourth july. üôÑ Got reference huge spike Midwest?  evidence Minnesota. 9/11 every 3 days.  Puts good use.  lots people ask info like dont believe it. Sigh. people realize Governor's.  fun blame trump Cuomo, Newsom others acted, states stuck head sand. quarter million dead end year maybe election. live knowing responsible quarter million deaths?

A narcissist psychopath! Probably reason everywhere - pandemic fatigued young people partying catching spreading amongst mortality rate much lower. Coupled fact doctors much knowledge treating patients severe cases opposed early days. Trump reiterated Town Hall tonight virus disappear without vaccine, also one available ‚Äúin weeks‚Äù every scientist said impossible. Knew someone say something like this!? Lmfao. thing is, Cardiac Arrests infectious studied centuries scientists know doing. way enforce curfew towns halloween before. Police tell people split go home. figure 405k roughly number ""total deaths"" US (419,400) according wiki. I'm assuming parent comment referring US deaths. sounds like parent comment used explicit deaths, casualties.   we‚Äôre #1! Physician billing meant hospitals. Especially said physicians use 3rd parties billing. hospitals actually usually accurate would listen lines correct something off. Though fair insurances extremely particular needs coded pay rejected. Medicare surprisingly reasonable coding done. get feeling even American know talking about? conservative bad missing something?

human solidarity point Quit falling CIA propaganda, jesus. hopefully people vote fuck around time. probably 225,000 COVID deaths election day... Source?  mean, sometimes things nothing do. there‚Äôs point dwelling past there? genetically modified mean leak lab isolated amplified. Knowing China, surprise all.

I can't find source Wuhan lab, I've included probable leak Bejing lab. Wuhan incident seems well scrubbed China's billion dollar PR effort.

But Wuhan lab possible infected lab worker self isolate exposed corona virus supposedly self isolated home SUPERVISION.

I'm dumb mother-in-law's sister passed COVID-19 past Saturday. feels unreal reason. Like keeps slowly creeping nothing stopping it. (My immediate family wears masks, social distances, tries leave house possible.) want wrong conception. However inverse quote. try see humanity loss statistics. tried read bios 700 us health care died. also count heart attacks kidney failure shock, exacerbated necessarily caused COVID. count based hospital coding reports insurance documents, therefore COVID deaths listed hospital properly compensated increased cost associated COVID patient

But speaking disabled person, - terrified becoming even disabled this. disabled already hard enough need shit burden people around me.

Dude, lose tens thousands people flu every year we've vaccine decades, we've known disease even longer, we've tracking scientifically since least early 1900's. intimate knowledge full breadth symptoms, transmission vectors, complications, long-term effects. developed effective treatments therapies help mitigate damage *do* still get it. vast majority people kind biological familiarity disease.

But novel flu vaccine ready effective treatments, end Spanish Flu infected estimated 500 million people killed *at least* 17 million people, possibly 50 million.

The longer goes on, convinced ""intelligent life destined destroy itself"" likely solution Fermi Paradox. Goalposts actually come preequipped wheels now. nothing surely dozens hundreds highly qualified highly educated scientists doctors done nothing study virus months. Surely non natural characteristics claims someone would noticed blown whistle? info Wow fucking shocking Bill. Actually not, people charge. People spent much time listening pointless speeches instead listening scientists. saying beginning masks important. Woah I'm really used numbers. 200‚Ç¨/night. Insurance cover usually pay 10‚Ç¨ (don't ask for).

The problem dependant insurance this: since illegal uninsured, everybody anyway. 
You get private insurance certain conditions though, get privileges (having worked hospital minuscule imo though). Usually quite wealthy people use option.
So would mean people 'better' insurance would actually disadvantaged position compared rest.   Well Big Ten today announced resuming play. think livelihood depends sports going ahead really. head doctor one jobs. Uhm... know south Korea one of, technologically advanced nation's right? New Zealand isnt third world country either. guess Vietnam would classify USA USA!!! USA #1.

‚ÄúYou increase risk getting wearing mask health care provider‚Äù - US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, March 2020


If people still confused mask effectiveness distrusting anything government health officials say right now, why. 


People try excuse behavior say didn‚Äôt know masks effective back February March. categorically false. Multiple studies done demonstrating efficacy masks, even simple surgical cloth masks, preventing spread viruses. showed masks effective protecting others wearer, increased protection wearer well. research clear far find, exactly zero studies ever shown masks increase risk getting virus (or virus). show opposite. coordinated campaign flagrant conscious lying nearly every public health official - people we‚Äôre supposed able trust. Don‚Äôt let hook let rewrite history. hurts heart. know youre /s fr FUCK saying. 

Its whats idiots say faced information contradicts beliefs. meant illegal aliens parents. quarter Hispanic kids anchor babies. economy implode collapse worse 2008.. feel it. Impeachment political process, legal one certainly criminal.

Democrats impeached. Republicans acquitted. along party lines. local state level, yes, successful shutdowns. problem soon there's *any* sign progress, push re-open immediately.

I think point Americans (and point, leadership) chosen pin hopes vaccine solve problems overnight without us modify behavior affect lives wealthy.  first returning humans moon! mean lot people already said fuck it. wear masks public indoors still mostly keep social bubble. otherwise gone back normal lives. kids school person masks. son back dance. run whatever errands need run. Actually it‚Äôs well documented 90% patients released hospitalization COVID suffer new chronic health problems College making friends fun too. blame government controlling virus administrators terrible plans.

These colleges already primarily online classes. didn‚Äôt go fully open, functioning college online. exactly 90% Canadians want keep border closed. know. respiratory failure one things listed MANY cases. shit! Covid respiratory disease.

**Why surgeons nurses wear surgery? That‚Äôs great question!**

[A 2010 study whether masks make difference surgical site infection. looking eight-hundred patients, split two groups half cases non-scrubbed staff wore masks half not, found difference rates SSI groups.

[A comprehensive 2002 review assessing effectiveness masks preventing infection. study involved total 1453 patients, even hypothesized cases surgical masks may contribute SSI. ultimate conclusion also unclear wearing mask ‚Äúresults harm benefit patient undergoing clean surgery.‚Äù

[A separate systematic review 2005 RCTs mask effectiveness OR. ways masks might *contribute* surgical site contamination. conclusion systematic review also that, ‚Äúit unclear whether wearing surgical face masks results harm benefit patient undergoing clean surgery.‚Äù 

[To date, one largest studies conducted subject shows masks actually associated increased infections. referenced study 50% decrease SSI seen omitting face masks, proceeded conduct single largest study date, including 3,088 patients. half procedures, operating room staff wore masks; half, not. result? found difference rate infection two groups

There plenty these, medical articles recently 2020 ... literally them: evidence masks provide protection OR, wear anyway. We‚Äôre number one!!!! Woohooo!!! enough smart people POWER. 

 baffles mind choose leaders right now. Even back day, former military leaders lawyers. People college educations. Now, business owners, members family dynasties celebrities, rare physician physicist engineer. ignoring advice educated insisting kids go school get education. Insisting businesses reopen preserve democracy/freedom choice, threatening cut funding colleges choose close semester. 

Our government officials need put jail. 200,000 charges negligent homicide. thing illegal parents? looked Germany lately? thought combination 1) short-term concern enough masks health professionals 2) nascent science efficacy masks? know better practicing outright deception? voted freedom, got freedom, yes sacrificed lives, America freedom important lives.

""I Disapprove Say, Defend Death Right Say It""

Give liberty, give death! shut roads 0 deaths road-traffic accidents many? think wearing masks social events take away entire purpose social events?

For bonus points explain me: Masks reduce transmission, eliminate it. that's case, allowing non-essential businesses open all? cognitive dissonance required say going grocery shopping without mask selfish going vacation Las Vegas totally fine wear mask staggering. Shows herd immunity option. Sweden right along. country went disastrous lockdown better.  shaken blame US misplaced live Florida, governor made blanket statement June numbers started go control.

We lockdown again, turn back reopening business businesses...

Not word word, exactly plan.

Follow Trump regardless cost lives hits economy prolonging spread.

Who right mind closes options make point.

PS - weeks pretty much shut bars again. But, recently reopened despite CDC standards met... many per thousand? I'm also wearing sweatpants moccasins youd like attack I'm wearing instead something substantial I've got sibling bubble NS. Almost cases one long-term care home... far, good. oh, one decides shut down? bad. Also, never said shit shut down. I'm opposed save lives.  say overcounting, would say we're closest realistic count.

COVID deaths less excess mortality. 

That's true Belgium, country. graph almost case study confuse viewer. 14 days stop spread.  America: Make, Buy number one! number one!üëçüòÅ thinking morning. Product might start shipping East west, even. Same! immediately make mask, making friends family March. mom retired RN. taught masks early on.  Anyone risk factors would increase likelihood bad outcome Covid: get flu shot!!! 

I did, free CVS also got $5 gift card shop CVS with. Go soon!!! Another article doesn‚Äôt belong sub readers don‚Äôt know interpret results understand statistical significance. September 11 attacks/Number deaths - 2,977

200,000 covid 19 deaths counting. 200,000 divided 2,977 equals 67 9-11 attacks. whole world stopped many things changed 2,977 deaths 200,000 deaths counting dismissed many people big deal must turn heads get life.

Why? None things mentioned discussion (also below) explain situation much better Italy days.

It's conundrum can't figure out! plausible genetics proved wasn‚Äôt happened like 6 months ago. Deaths lack taxes, government choose? mean? Let's take guy example. Odds probably making Europe. pay better things cheaper. Trust me, super easy become multi-millionaire 30's I'm genius. guy probably decent amount money saved up. Probably good retirement funds, spending cash decent invested house. like have. Probably good career too.

So let's take whataboutism. Say loses job. probably problem finding one since sounds like established career. job market actually really good right now. Trust me, I'm living it. realize half unemployment California alone. means things really good around rest country. probably problem finding another job.

But job, know sounds crazy, go get health insurance. Insane concept know. means medical bills covered. get kid really hard understand insurance works. pay insurance covers bills. pay monthly amount, pay hospital bills. getting paid anything, get Medicade. means get free healthcare. get hospital bill, Medicade pays bill.

Here realizing. guy obviously adult. means takes care unlike someone like dependent. rely anyone like you. means makes money money saved up. able buy house 2 cars. Nobody got him. himself. also means problem getting health insurance. cost health insurance minor too. kinds additional money bank. enough money buy houses, cars, insurance, private school kid, vacations, etc. money. afford that. lose job, use money save. Then, guess what, go find another job. life.

Not everyone someone take care them. everyone government take care them. take care fine. Honestly, people actually entire life. die plenty money left over. called inheritance. Inheritance common. Everytime hear need realize someone died able spend money had. position you. fine scared living street noone holds hand. ACTUALLY even take care people. kids. enough money bring humans world use money keep humans alive. much extra money have. know seem like reality point realize odds situation. saving spare change new graphics card. lot people much money buy house, car, boat, kinds things. really rare thing do. guy it, I've done it, people around it. paying taxes. Believe not, need government give money survive. work make money. even money bills paid fun things. life. insurance too! time ever entire country shutdown two weeks. Philosophy, science, religion.....it intersects give you, human, opinion number things. opinions amoral, yes, considered POS. And, Joe Rogan‚Äôs opinion coronavirus may level thinking murder okay, exploring extreme end spectrum used prove point. hope see that. There‚Äôs lot gray between, approaches extreme, person approaching POS territory. don‚Äôt know specifics Joe Rogan‚Äôs view coronavirus honest. But, he‚Äôs denying science promoting behavior can, proven to, increase death toll, yes, he‚Äôs approaching POS territory.  Policymakers use advice knowledge public health experts make decisions regarding health public. mean public health experts epidemiologists around world plotting global take over? it! ""I played football Ohio State University 1989 Well, skin game, speak. livelihood depends sports going ahead Belgium aggressive counting cases deaths.

That's excess mortality fits nearly perfectly COVID deaths.

Other countries count people die hospitals died without tested, COVID numbers reported lower real ones.

Yes, lockdown might caused extra deaths people seeking medical attention, also saved lot people reducing traffic accidents deaths air pollution.

Look reported COVID deaths UK, Spain France, compare excess mortality 3 countries since March far 50k deaths each. ever hear term ‚Äúbubble‚Äù ? America First! Woooooooooo!!!! Congratulations! ""Did mother dress you? have.""  reason discuss things like death rate percentage long term impacts try figure done virus. low percentage die develop permanent disabilities means shutting world warranted virus. asked percentage is. That's problem folks - care - think - see - you.

I give fuck bar go open. care big picture bars - - feeling good.""

Point proven.

Here one wedding killed seven people attend. 

Let nail point home - dumb fuckers made selfish decision passed contagious disease onto others - make choice - robbing choice. Without permission. taking lives. Seven people far attend said wedding.

Seven people make stupid choice paid price one.

America eighth worst per-capita covid death rate.

We're 65 9/11s corpse count counting.

Third leading cause death America now.

And people like sure fuck helped make happen. See, that's reality. places - world - done better. Ranging across political ideological spectrum, forms government cultures - done better.

Better America. Better you.

Probably better values do.

But redneck alcoholic, right? 

You gotta get drink on. what's important.

After - like said - feel fine, bar open - you. You. You. You. You.

Fuck you. fuck rat-bastard daddy raised suck ignorant, cowardly, dishonest selfish kid. Actions versus words. Asians seem better priorities. mean actually need test unless sick cases. friend's daughters odd illness symptoms awhile back asked covid tests doctors said since showing fever, need test. 

I think going back take tests people really need get test think might it. legit symptoms, probably need one Would've easy govt declare emergency nationalize mask production ensure health care workers masks. Yet, given blatant lies, misdirection, miscommunication instead. LSU hasn‚Äôt even started season yet

Nobody really thinks issue *games*. people practice together/spend time together close contact 7 days fans stadiums 25 percent capacity most. 

They still come into/out stadium, use bathrooms, etc. really worth Also coaches game officials required wear masks.

Masks substitute distancing. also offer protection wearer, largely protect others. coaches need protected players way around. Can't remember many times said basically got votes. People, even soon doctor boyfriend, ready think govt people charge actually straight evil completely incompetent. moment changed stance people started fear buying coincidental. Spanish flu stopped pandemic without vaccine. YMMV absolutely current state businesses live.

This may come shock you, people social animals like avoid others. Also bombshell: people spent every weekend bars, smoking cigarettes, eating grossly unhealthy foods restaurants exactly prioritize health. non-zero number people want go restaurants, casinos, bars, coffee shops, they're forced wear mask avoid people. 

If really think people keep social distancing without guidelines mandates, let's remove guidelines mandates. certainly meme

Sweden twice congratulated WHO, even recommended New Zealand move toward model (links end). Sweden also focus intense analysis epidemiologists worldwide believe model intelligible long run.

So, think there's lot denial circulating Sweden

Primarily, parking US moment, one dressing UK, Italy, Spain Belgium etc worst outcomes Sweden (who lock down).

And Swedish deaths 0 - 50 age group (73) 0 -60 Group (240) better many countries, 12 countries higher deaths per fact relation US, Sweden \~6 times lower amount deaths 0-50 age group.

Of course like many places Europe (primarily mentioned above) countries poor figures, deaths came mostly massive outbreaks Nursing homes obviously calamitous failure behalf.

However economy hit nearly hard pandemic others. save lives long run.

And presently positioned much better many countries Europe including Netherlands, Norway Denmark, lower daily new cases deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

* Quote: Wednesday, first time since spring, higher rates infection registered Norway Sweden. Denmark 2.1 new cases per 100,000 people, Norway 1.5 Sweden 1.1, TT news agency reported.

Also deaths associated lockdowns (suicides, missed cancer operations, deaths substance abuse etc etc - list long) negligible effect Swedes date unlike countries. lives ultimately protected way.

And finally today Sweden, right now, place cafes, restaurants, bars nightclubs open masks virtually nowhere seen, indoors shopping malls course outdoors. people freer mentally much better adjusted right vast majority, all, countries lockdown.

That's paddlin. People saying ok get it. that's problem. misinformation makes younger people think invincible. People need smarten up.

Not sure would problems choice health?

The value one human life function total number humans planet people spending money award this? True, also true. America much better. judging entire country based roads. ridiculous thing say. spent weekend Copenhagen, I'm going say Denmark great Copenhagen cobblestone roads.  Congrats guys, best! almost like specific time period combined report date deaths proove Sweden highest number reported covid deaths per capita Europe. Remember? Pepperidge farm remembers. can't speed reaction new substance human body ‚Äì makes development slow even modern times. moment everyone involved simply must hope new vaccines major side effects show years ‚Äì nobody usual tests it. even new types vaccine never used humans...  really wish people talked comparing flu, remember huge amount herd immunity vaccines natural immunity flu. bodies 0 experience virus. even deadly flu still would've killed people flu something new.  Apparently underestimated number people susceptible pre existing conditions. Hell yeah brother. died terrorism 9/11. fire building collapse make Bush look bad.

0.00000009% population death 9/11 means shit! Apparently based 71,400 infections 95% confidence level somewhere 0 181,050. Basically meaningless range variability...

Sampling done ""cohort elective surgery patients Australia"", also non-representative general population, doubly meaningless result extrapolated entire population Australia.

As aside, number would represent 2 3 people unknowingly virus. Trying separate lockdown mask recommendation mask mandate graphs (which used estimate impact face coverings) seems like extremeley difficult task. 

You would least want control, area exact lockdown measures kept mask mandate different time. understand correctly trying separate effect masks effects distancing based timeline curve alone? [God bless... unided posted like 49 times Yeah really. like what, no, we‚Äôre almost end... wait... there‚Äôs still whole quarter left?? Fuck.. Yeah.

AFAIK infected sound reason believe I've exposed. any, course would kept ass home. agreed man. first months people ridiculed ones realized gonna get worse. remember april people said summer gonna okay, couldnt beleive people didnt take serious. fuck youre stage ""i told so""/ shit exhausting. point made realize dumb majority human population is.

I guess given caveat also believe *overall* closer 0.5% figure new data taking well (I read Oxford study CDC article before). still think, however, good flexible range covers unknowns moment because, alluded to, lot compounding factors communities include things like age, race, socioeconomic status, healthcare access, homo/heterogeneous diffusion virus given communal outbreak. 

As far sources, older article Nature *decent* job breaking couple studies interviews epidemiologist Timothy Russell. Otherwise, heard range thrown around recently August Dr. Osterholm podcast, even though also gives caveat IFR awhile ballpark range. Forgive time pull exact episode timestamp.

Also, lot studies, including several ones linked, either preprints peer-reviewed. IFR tricky nebulous statistic pinpoint. Especially *a lot* bad, sensational hyperbolic science happening hard statistic track heat pandemic. yes, IFR much lower thought start pandemic truly believe end up, statistically, within range. think would really mattered control? 

Whether pandemic response program place mostly result choices Congress state technological development. think Trump told staff members try fix situation? lost hundreds millions already. 

Yes, Trump old senile, basically everyone 37 is. Obama much great least old fart. get Democrats pick *anyone* need crutches.  Literally nowhere earth has, we're middle pandemic. much CIA paying days? also still question long immunity effective. kinda let Quebec thing.... trying become country least last 30 years so. Canadian apologize them. They're like sibling dont talk anymore ahahhaahaah Come now, people get desensitized tragic news‚Äî famine, war, many non-COVID related deaths. Unless literally mourn deaths every single person world, cannot say you‚Äôre desensitized least it. games must? Nah. 

Do need beer? Nope. drink usually, driving car conceal carrying. Whatevs.

But reduced life musts needs only, would hell earth, really worth living all.

And AFAIK kill anyone, would require infected sound reason believe infected. Imagine actually putting /a like someone would actually read üòÇ America number one. fair, scaring people compliance something rarely works. 

Then again, taking numbers saying worry organizing mass group hug sessions people 21 also best idea. People 21 still *spread* virus long-term health issues. haven‚Äôt hit fall wave yet. ""It is"" Sure, there's cases people dying within hours, that's unusual untreated ARDS. There's many cases COVID people rapidly difficulty breathing need treatment within hours. know one ""I can't breathe"", called ambulance, put supplemental oxygen, ventilator, died (55, pre-existing conditions). happened 1918, would've lasted days (or less), three weeks.

There's many factors beyond medicine different ‚Äì 1918 end WWI, unlikely people healthy, destroyed infrastructure probably rebuilt etc. Much ICU equipment available (ventilators, supplemental oxygen, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation etc).

Very compelling convincing reason America shithole.

So made difference last years low death rate year‚Äôs high death rate? Oh that‚Äôs right Covid. 

No matter stats year cherry pick, Covid killed lot people. None.

And yes, COVID-19 disease causes, 2-3 years stop calling simply put mix others call flu. 

For example get sick Coronaviruses (alpha coronavirus)
NL63 (alpha coronavirus)
OC43 (beta coronavirus)
HKU1 (beta coronavirus)

You don‚Äôt say ‚Äúoh got 229E sickness‚Äù. say got flu. That‚Äôs it. novelty novel Coronavirus wears off, become bundled flu illnesses. consider dead grandma end chain transmission meet anyone cold? 

Most older people know explicitly said one feel guilty try find blame happen catch virus. Unlike people sub, people mature enough come terms risk death make judgement acceptable level risk. normal people, suspending social life 12-18 months destroying economy process terrible trade risk. US guys lucky wont probably happen all.

I Czech, point 1700 positives day (for 11M country thats it) skyrocketing upward trend. R0 1.6 right now. trying contain mitigation measures gov wait roughly 14 days regional council elections prevent popularity drop. 

And then, afraid, hardcore Israel style lockdown hit. Unless kind miracle happens measures manage curb spread. bring numbers back down, dont belive even would enough. 

I really hope wont enact seeing numbers, real possibility... Yes virus that‚Äôs killing fewer 1 1000 reproductive aged people explains evolution. Stay inside want. think agree that. Again, please re-read said. Also, COVID isn‚Äôt guaranteed death sentence. healthy fit young person, survive COVID little side effects. still reduced active outbreak. 

That's thing - business revenue better wile open + big local outbreak. Illonois lockdown since March???  wife almost did, find anything else least make going insurance (which terrible, shocking know). decided quit hoping would go back online month. see goes. Hopefully, survive. Pffftt. Ive got N64. agree, would help lot! doesn‚Äôt good whatever, help keep us mentally healthy. 2014, successfully gain-of-function flu virus making much contagious. scientific community became worried reasoned type research done. stopped accidents allowing virus escape can't prevented 100%. 2017, funding resumed. argument again?

Take look big ""200 thousand Americans dead"" title post currently responding on.

Great job, America right, you‚Äôre jealous don‚Äôt live shithole apartment like you.

Am I? Feel free point said that. one constantly thinks me

How? responding you? exact thing doing? what, think you‚Äôre somehow different American?? 

I'm American, yes, different Canada doesn‚Äôt rely US much strategically economically. 

Sure, USA relies China whole lot. China bit shithole elitist scum...who lives shitty apartment. 

How elitist? never even brought forced it.

I problem dissing Canada, country problems nearly ignorant said, you‚Äôre good sucking USA cock....like you‚Äôre here.

I mean, person sucking USAs cock vain attempts defending country amount criticism. really know talking about. IFR much closer 0.25%, that's heavily skewed towards elderly, immunocompromised people comorbidities. overestimate opinion billionaires. alive important part communication. No, referred ‚Äòpositivity rate.‚Äô  disagree, 2 different reasons. week week change useful early warning coming change trend. started flipping prior obvious surge south. case, Im legitimately curious whether change trend last days causation reporting issue. Isn‚Äôt Vermont fairly homogeneous state people? 

I live Florida. It‚Äôs basically crowded carnival. üòÇ   Google going heat map scheduling provider testing rolled every state? people saying meet friends park masks seem realize that's going cut two years. Especially Winter way North East. Exactly. doctors told rest month could. van-dwelling/couch-surfing looked jobs new state, father kind asshole thinks entire world trying take advantage him. Shit sucked still does. Flu season going equivalent pouring jet fuel already massive building fire. 

Things get *really* bad. lot higher that.

Changes reporting method ensured US hiding real numbers bureaucratic tape srtaight lies. What's worse covid stretches medical resource thin little power deal illness days. If, god forbid, one breaks leg, could visit hospital that's end story; days, even want get near hospital prefer science compared tin foil hat conspiracy theories. like we've reached inevitable conclusion American Dream. believing within every individual's power change circumstances, absolve societal responsibility, divorce compassion fellow humans.

That interesting way frame effects believing individual absolute control life. Whereas truthfully society contains power, therefore improve society ""we""?? One hope candy corn next. Regulate like.... Make prescription (in case oxy) illegal use outside clinical setting? (fent) peer-reviewed another data point trying gain understanding virus. Thanks Facebook! Universal basic income month 2.

Boom financial troubles lockdown alleviated.  probably go ahead accept they're totally going get away it. Biden popping office wont change much. Court proceedings knowingly made aprse would literally take decades convict everyone involved. going happen, what's going one biggest cases crimes humanity ever occur human history. Sir may interest news article New Zealand? western Australia, Australia general? Plus believe south Korea well. legitimately working intended many conservatives. know old coworker, would talk length variety topics, believed place private charity help people social safety nets.

Insanity. No. listen bigots, white person Atheist, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Wiccan, etc part Core America.

Any LGBT white person part Core America.

They even consider hetero white people live affluent elite coastal areas, master's degrees Vassar, buy vegetarian food Whole Foods, yoga, solar panels house Palo Alto Connecticut ""not part Core America"".

I witnessed racist proclaim white man college brochure ""couldn't possibly American"" skinny, well dressed, wearing European style trendy clothing. racist assumed man must ""either gay German"".

Core America white. also hetero, cisgender, fat, Christian, working class, uneducated, poorly dressed. plenty white friends targets Core America's bullying. Took moments get this.... trajectory. USA aiming moon! bad leadership. Officially yes, reality no. I'm disappointed Florida, yet entertained london. West falling apart around us. spend money military industrial complex rather basic research sensible investments. think culture burned failing it. market unleashed failed us source guidance. course benefited sucess cracks showing. always used mock Soviets five year tractor plans seem plan anything anymore. planning also seems fail. ""Who knew human knowledge would make us dumber."" - Ronny Chieng Murica !!! Thank response. I‚Äôm still wondering difference NY CO. locked down, mask mandate early, received national attention well responded. However experienced 2 peaks cases looks like we‚Äôre heading third. Could herd resistance (not immunity) thing places get hit hard fast? That's size city. everybody! 

USA #1 Man call duty going weird direction Pretty sure using ""we"" signify collective blame come finger pointing asshole alienate anyone. recall ever downplaying masks. think you‚Äôre going help OP voting guy even pro-lockdown? originate China. Look ppl blaming Trump alone this. Remember people caused cases go up. riots, parties, rally's way many things contributed this. medical field? guess ""no"". 

This first rodeo, know they're doing. Trust process. Um nope. cdc said ruling deaths underlying conditions covid. they're 20k deaths directly caused covid Bill stick code...poor code.

History shows value masks...at PRICE 15 MILLION DEAD.

&amp;#x200B;

History repeats mankind hairless talking primate memory fish. What‚Äôs Stalin quote? One person tragedy, hundred thousand statistic? Canada personal freedoms need, get bent.  It‚Äôs car accidents ^/s I‚Äôve wondered masks least help us keep normal flu control year personally know 2 actually covid deaths... OMG right doubt! real numbers counting people tested positive within 60 days dying unrelated causes... USA! USA! Conflicting information... scientific illiteracy? least 200k deaths passed upon Covid. Would love know actual non-political (ie Marxist) number.   high contrast ""Sweden lowest spread""

It's contrary all, look graph Swedish infections vs. european countries. Yeah fully agree. Trump said moronic ridiculous statements throughout pandemic. 


I simply pointing surge summer nothing compared canexpect winter. summer supposed things calmed down. Look Western Europe example summer supposed like us. 


Expect hellhole winter 1500-3000 deaths day. cases people knowing covid common flu ""are private ~~not~~ profit homes use federal guidelines""

FTFY guy gets it. source prior comment. Nice job However, number 200,000 also number deaths exceeding average number deaths US months March July year alone. numbers probably much, much higher that. Give 'em India stick mate.

Nothing beats brain like repeated blows ego. :) Correct I'm wrong, .005 US population right? course not.

Mentioned day 1.

Flu vaccines require six months production order get sufficient quantities 'begin' distribution.

&amp;#x200B;

That established time frame.

Longer unfamiliar strain requires testing. Cuba democracy? getting upvotes. Reddit lol. Ignorance finest. fire contained continent now. know of, could actually affect me, Trump pulled troops germany whatever fuck important even didnt impact life slightest. goes nearly everyone else europe. US really doesnt matter much think. Sure, saw maybe 100 people tiny BLM protest city really isnt problem like basically protest sake instagram pics. C-H-A-N-C-E low. sure children died falling tree. People understand probabilities flock sub. punishment bad math. Belgium overcounts. coronavirus, it‚Äôs related common cold influenza. spreads easily cold, kill. would good thing vast majority people. former, I'm certain. sweep long-term effects illness rug expect people stop whining get it. 

""Why worried 'breathing hard'? work office.""
~ Actual question boss bronchitis. instead refuting said claims resort petty insults. Classy Let guess why. It‚Äôs one word. it‚Äôs worst feeling: anxiety. Good, let continue. people understand depression feels like. trite misleading comment. definitely belongs reddit. Number one!

Fml mention year? üòâ Okay lol sucks. Unfortunately part problem society attitude workers rights associated sick pay shit. Society also negatively associates recovering malingering really sounded ironic government part Belgium overcounting too. Good luck trying convince family that! much expensive quality comparable? another bombardier snc success story? Life gotten better since border closed.

I dont see yankee plates 90kph playground/school zones more. uncle marriage counselor, says couples seeking counseling difficult deal with. cases claims one party taking virus serious destroying hope peace them. Thanks response! accessible tests there? people general ‚Äúwait see‚Äù mindset even really sick? Afraid high medical bills? presumptions have. Yikes. Sounds like precautions really working eh. #1 Interesting thanks perspective. still want know user from. talk lot shit US obviously I'm curious deal is. Nice facism Wooooo #1!!! entering ocean forbidden? pretty sure killed children young adults okay. I'm glad Trump kept us panicking. Greatest president ever.

MAGA 209000+ law couple hosting wedding deserve financally ruined charlatan officiating.

That's really decide. lot people sub giving bad legal advice imo cause pain suffering involved.

Edit: Besides practical legal reasons couple hosting wedding cannot held responsible, even possible prove Covid killed people rehabilitation center even came wedding? employee got Covid grocery store, gas station, ect... could say high probability employee received Covid roommate whoever attended wedding, cannot prove employee got virus.

If good lawyer, would find way get employees car GPS logs use every public destination employee stopped within incubation period virus potential spots employee received virus. really lucky, would even find place employee stopped case Covid 1 employees customers. could even go talk employees public places employee stopped see knew came contact anyone diagnosed Covid time frame looking for. fact, could process person attended wedding well. 

What trying say thousand different holes could poke case wedding couple far removed deaths. slowing down? Speeding up? says mass influx new cases .... chose drug one making i've addictions hard drugs...if really wanted stop cared abou5 would stop. perspective large skew is, Lombardy's deaths per million 1690. rest Italy's, without Lombardy, 374. Music gonna slower. Road quality = quality life. Got it. Australia: Wow. make study. is... Big news. Um. Ireland back beer yet? Cause I... Whoa! hell that!? Idunno, still think america third world country wearing gucci belt. people nice, though interactions strangers people work, can't exactly ""themselves"" makes sense. model varies wildly designed properly. Deaths New Year's set stone right now. Theoretically, could isolate every American freeze place, we'd 0 new cases within 2 weeks. projections models change conditions/assumptions put model change. example, Nationwide mask mandate put place tomorrow, death projections would probably fall 300,000 New Year's.

Also, think might oversimplifying local spikes work head bit. state done outbreak already ""surge"". Even high end estimates say 15% population infected; likely somewhere 5-10%. loooongg way away herd immunity.  passed long time ago. Look ""excess deaths"". Like come fuck ignorant

Lmao damn dude! high quality irony. Unless UN step create global framework around tests documented move inch here. IATA airlines might come ""passport covid"" - like tickets electronical systems passenger data shared across globe today could share proof covid test done departure airport confirmed airline. IANAL, doubt cases either would hold court. cases could see holding court are:

1. Suing venue hosted wedding enforcing state laws (if books violated), or

2. Suing rehabilitation center following state laws regarding testing employees. sure links work since y‚Äôall can‚Äôt google see many sources available, go. Reddit moment Worth noting recorded COVID deaths. Plenty reporting smaller counties rising numbers COVID adjacent deaths, cardiac arrest pneumonia, instead classified COVID directly.  
 
The number much higher. Wait. totally agree, what's sonar part about? oxford expertise priizer had

Oxford working together AstraZeneca, also pretty big pharma company. big Pfizer, big enough run trial. friend said yesterday. exact words ""The whole virus bs. true pandemic 1out 3 people would it. Trying scare public. know are.""
Like holy sh**. NURSE. fellow Americans. Nah, need brown people kill bunch us. we‚Äôll unite  EMT I've lost count many patients I've lost pandemic. many people I've transported ER symptoms triaged facilities. Seeing numbers knowing people I've met families I've see lose loved one upsets me. think upsets meeting people still refuse believe pandemic, still refuse wear mask, put everyone else risk fucking piece shit president ours. come home exhausted everyday like coworkers, doctors, nurses, etc. told we're liars faking numbers people. Ah yes, remember vividly already congratulating good job going coming far 200k deaths.

Sounded absurd time congratulating something accomplished yet. even absurd come anywhere near numbers suggesting. go away soon trump gone every MAGA dies covid. wish one willing accept defeat. say lying. we‚Äôre fucked up? administration present sucks? one does?

According depressed, socially anxious, unemployed, whining bitches Reddit...I guess so. issue conservatives come theory explain away.

Like ""the CDC released study says 6% people reportedly died covid actually did.""

Which false. becaus covid isnt primary cause, doesnt mean cause.

If fall, impact kills me, cause death falling. 200,000 dead entire US population (roughly 350mil) isn‚Äôt even significant rounding error. Heart disease kills 600,000 Americans year. People afraid new virus yet aren‚Äôt even addressing current health status. charge this? even degree ü•≥ *America looked death eye said 'give best shot' death responded punching face over* Canada: Well yeah. Ya'll ought take look this. America #1! Easy, forget carry balance forward 2021. 

Accountants hate trick. Ohhh hear flesh light anal bleaching? know woman hoards them, whatcha think they'll worth come christmas? WE'RE üëè NUMBER üëè ONE!!! üëè üëè üëè hate trump much next guy, didn‚Äôt start him. Americans don‚Äôt care other. (im working scrip please wait)
Canada: Yeah, listen now, making studies virus.... Given deaths happened 2 months, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs long time all.

All takes new outbreak Astute observation, Mr. Newton. consider people tourism industry lower income range? Pilots probably earn Ha, denial. Southerner checking in. things mention? People done damn thing different pages I've lived this. Moved Alabama Louisiana, see shit still around. Went grocery store monthly stock week ago legit person store mask probably 150 people. I've dudes knocking door week offering tree removal law care services (post hurricane damage) trying shake hand. fucking stupid I'm probably going die fucking bumpkins can't follow rules science. AZ, fentenal packaged like blue bombers (popular dose oxy). people dying left right thinking taking oxy, really taking high fent dose. So, denial. wild strawman! r/CoronavirusWeddings Worldwide sure, mistake think developed nations enough next year. Wow, getting worse really quickly. Three posts five.  Fauci still human can‚Äôt predict everything certainty. Especially we‚Äôre talking something unprecedented every single pharma company world working thing it‚Äôs number 1 priority time other. Let‚Äôs leave urge listen experts come out. Thanks. USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! still needs analyzed heated recall correctly far pregnancy test is. They're scientists, oracles. process learning totally new virus.

The outbreak spread church pastor Sanford least 10 people sick far, maybe since believe worse regular flu pastor keeps telling masks like wire fencing. I'm betting refusing cooperate. also hired lawyer worked Terry Shiavo's parents. Ok cringelord microwave popcorn aisle empty day. Also, usual suspects, Lysol wipes spray, rubbing alcohol, Softsoap liquid. neither 200,000 330,000,000 Covid also causes blood clots basically every organ. respiratory. Goodnews, country South Africa 1000 cases per day. Although still much bigger issues society government virus revealed going able fixed change administration. get rid shitty 'two team' election system, we're going keep going back forth back forth seems like time pendulum swings goes fringes whatever side wins.

I agree first sentence, less optimistic second.

Even replace system, antivaxxers anti mask types going ruin day votes. Given bottom barrel quality US public education system, getting rid next decades least. least almost every one deniers claim physicians purposefully misidentified deaths COVID...for yet undefined reason. 

It equal parts appalling absolutely unbelievable millions people country believe conspiracy theories. No, meant middle, 30-60, could effect low mortality range. Mysterious Pneumonia Yea, number passengers large numbers essentially shifting time spent security time waiting test come back. Honestly big deal.

Italy believe even allowed tests taken Drive-through arrive car. test would done arrive terminal. That's clever! distinction pseudo intellectual.  get stabbed bunch knives, die collective trauma. Question, hard get information: compared previous years, many people died US month? much more, less, same? mean 1918-1919 spanish flu still took 3 times number lives US It‚Äôs perfect I‚Äôm proud American.

We're upper range estimated casualties Hiroshima Nagasaki combined. defended logic open argument

Great. *logic open argument* inoculating people patently false claims flat earth, etc? honest human nature, fact far many people dangerously ignorant point unable distinguish fact fiction, especially intentionally weaponized people ill intentions. vast majority people armed critical thinking skills sufficient distinguish fact fiction, cannot allow deceivers destroy humanity. noticed incredible growing number people social media believe WILD conspiracy theories? Someone intervene society serious shit.

I advocating giving power ""Ministry Truth."" simply must something prevent misinformation overtaking truth every damned issue. Please done. Life rough patches 2020 absolutely rough almost everyone, get this. bit unlikely. might agreed back july, ton states got hit really hard (especially south) ton better now. is. since Trump called 'win' numbers stayed 200000 make loser. went years 6 months now. strange, influenza life shook badly. felt like dying could barely even walk. disabled days. long recovery. came went within days. open door... warm weather reason seeing million deaths? breaks pretty basic rule economics markets dont function create efficient healthcare

Honestly, even fundamental rules broken due nature healthcare. supply demand model requires customer able go competition prices high. must also able buy anyone prices high.

See problem? rules can't apply healthcare. emergency, cannot choose go. Moreover cannot decide get treatment risk life (or maybe kids'). **A free market cannot work healthcare.**

You're afraid Big Government making slow inefficient? Small Government? Implement free healthcare state level! allows states choose individually much want spend it. Like that, states find important spend little without forced states spend more. People work say ""they fudging numbers, get covid die something else still count covid death""

Possibly related note: person company wearing mask desk.. Imagine losing family member trying deal lawyers legal system try win unwinnable case couple married.

The mask wearing based precautionary principle (which support) rather strong rigorous evidence. actually underestimate stupid selfish americans are.  many webpages scientist looking things ongoing.

I'm 17 generally healthy aware low chances pernament consequences would like make even lower. Thanks! Theyre conspiracy nut, able change mind. okay 40 million people getting thrown onto street protect privileged family.

You're right nationally locked months ago didn't. ship long sailed time figure everyone epically financially fucked pandemic. People *will* start dying economic effects virus.

It's incredibly selfish even try understand point. think herd immunity like made-up term something? course plausible. Well, times, visiting grandparents going party pretty foolish thing do. well completely isolating, meeting sudden? know giving hypothetical, one seems pretty easily avoidable.

But situations life, state, don't/can't know got sick, gave you. something think anyone spend time worrying about.  universal. 

A number European countries also thousands tens thousands anti-lockdown mask protests.

Most countries threaten citizens fines arrests get wear masks. Even several million lives worth total economic collapse. Unless Dutch health authorities. love wrong topic multiple times per season. Masks including. pick shot, pallets boxes, inject every single politician family member. Let sit months, give rest world.

However, correct, respect decision go. think wrong. me, much health communities' health large. Maine wedding perfect example that.

I agree ludicrous. me, wearing mask little bit annoying uncomfortable. welcome keeps mindful things, giving people space, touching I'm buying store, eyeballing hand sanitizer way in/out business etc. 

When confronted people say masks anything bc virus particle size blah blah whatever, that's point - there's harm wearing reminds take Covid mitigation measures I'm wearing it. gone non-existent third leading cause death federal leadership?

Genuinely curious.

And question assholes like care all. bar open, right, drunko? Please stop anti mask bullshit. quit selfish, fuck. Maybe smoking oregano citations seroprevalence leading controlling spread? understanding looking CDC seroprevalence NYC 6.9%, still long way heard immunity. disagree assessment reopening state, science showing social distancing, masks, limited group sizes helping stop spread.

[This says New York City herd immunity. 

If use Brazilian data: 40% herd immunity threshold + 0.17% IFR, would 228,000 deaths America. Seems like we're awfully close already. Maybe IFR herd immunity threshold higher, highly doubt order magnitude saw many deaths occurred NY, states lower seroprevalence stem spread virus protect lives? 

Because virus can't contained locking increases severity second order effects. goal keep hospitals overwhelmed. states anything hospitals approaching 200k Americans dead NY, got hit hard early, less 1/6 that. US handling terribly compared developed nations.

You worded accomplishment state containing 6% US population also 16% deaths. We've gotten better treating COVID. Florida nothing still track less deaths New York. I'd rather live Florida New York. Going school (limited) spectators sports tipping point. pandemic end socially ends medically.

Vaccinating risk hopefully cutting deaths seal deal. many fucking contradictions week week.

Yeah I'd wager AC would risk, even lot apartments central AC. I've never lived major city apartments I've seen outside big city AC personal window one would needed, cause issue. Even city (Philly case) older buildings fitted central AC.

If didn‚Äôt want people hoard masks, should‚Äôve told people needed preserve healthcare workers. Or, better yet, systems place direct supply chain masks healthcare facilites random people don‚Äôt ability buy supply first place. 

They took worse possible path, intentionally lying people, simultaneously creating widespread confusion pervasive misinformation completely destroying credibility health authorities. result deceit, public trust permanently eroded, rightfully so. People US getting shot it, makes sense minimum wage employees risk actual life wild west mother fuckers enforcing beliefs. Shh, don‚Äôt talk Sweden here.

Now back cage, citizen. Desperation. court created Nazi crimes done deeds(holocaust etc.) even crimes court decided crimes. 

If fine that, can't decide Trump done crime? fine long one deciding Trump criminal enough power behind him? nothing laws all? Cuba far communist utopia. official salary $20 USD per month (or $30 USD doctors), many Cubans moonlight make ends meet, e.g. tourism, small (black market) enterprises.

However, given opportunity, many Cuban doctors professionals would aspire leave island pursuit better compensation market-based economy. wear mine need go carry hand sanitizer me, understand confusion here.

The answer question people gave shit. Next question understand masks legitimately helpful preserving droplet safety degree, right? can't truly think masks help, especially N95+'s. stupidest fucking thing I've observed people taking masks pulling cough sneeze, addition forgetting something called Swiss cheese model health care anticipates regulated amount deaths due human error alone. virus moment already shown significant signs lifelong health concerns conditions; really want gamble permanence health, means selfish.

Can name many countries looser restrictions Covid present (after previously declaring Covid-free) thus still risk deaths

They've 3 deaths cluster. That's far fewer almost every country time frame even per capita worse drop GDP than, say, us morons UK locked late yet drop GDP greater 2008 crash.

'New Zealand one last countries OECD report second quarter GDP data. **UK already posted year-on-year drop 21.7 per cent**, France almost 14 per cent, Italy 12 per cent Canada 12 per cent. US dropped 9.5 per cent.

He said **ASB expected see drop 11 per cent quarter**. That‚Äôs revised 17 per cent drop ASB expected lockdown first took effect. Tuffley said, Government support continuing sectors badly hit expected, impact less.'

Aren't sick spreading bullshit?

Meanwhile, NZ re-opened longer far less strict lock third quarter compared UK. Let's see UK reports, shall we? Heh.

Oh, we're numbers, care compare UK's COVID cases/deaths NZ's? I'm even NZ, appears rather obvious one country done far better (that's gross understatement - per capita basis, UK **123 times** deaths NZ), saying. don‚Äôt want get sick stay home countries different ways counting covid deaths? (eg. countries count deaths covid, others deaths covid)

The idea people seem have, US would somehow spared someone else last election, simply ridiculous.

We can't say things would exactly regardless steps taken, reality US always going hit hard this. get downvoted understanding hold true developed nations. fear monger mongering article. Social distancing compliance even worse. Many stores painted ""ONE WAY"" signs floor start row prevent people walking past other, almost one honors it. think people would feel pretty shit this: grandmother fine isolating well, meet anybody. go party visit day after. Afterwards get message somebody party positive; test positive well, also grandmother. person saw lately you. dies.

I mean, lot cases know gives who. sometimes could pretty obvious.

I think could shrug part nature. I'd feel like killer her.  saw minivan today decal window said ""you dumb wearing mask driving""

Also, wear mask driving even windows down.

Apparently, Netherlands found multi-faceted approach channel virus way number cases similar even lower countries masks obligatory. obligation wearing masks opinion one stringent corona rules there, Netherlands manage without it, shouldn‚Äôt interesting research possible countries might pursue flexible mask policy well? don‚Äôt know you, would prefer wear mask, quite burden someone‚Äôs personal freedom (and mean freedom practical way, edgy way republicans US use you‚Äôre gonna put words mouth didn‚Äôt mean). Yeah, really sucks. Ethically, I'd feel inclined go funeral. Weddings awesome, weddings inherently selfish. make bad. love weddings. However, considering current circumstances (we live bible belt state high degree transmission) hard time fathoming irresponsibility selfishness traditional large wedding. Eventually. everyone gets recovers dies, wont enough non immune people left keep going. Ie, people mumps vaccine = immunity, people un immune safe enough people catch spread it. That's people care high vaccine rates. keeps herd immunity up, allowing non immune people alright, even active cases, enough people infect keep going.  ""Never attribute malice adequately explained stupidity"" 1/3. Quite significant. *loud vocal minority

Lol, right, callous disregard. quote Draper, ""That's money's for.""

How callous disregard people poverty? Restaurant workers, low income families? hospital workers laid off? find much worse place lockdown policies. could give shit internet points.

There sooo many shades grey. That's I'm saying. agree would difficult extreme things, what? less extreme things would helped tremendously. Shut bars strongly encourage mask use early would MUCH better off. Haha it‚Äôs misinformation, wearing masks years longer something people going do. welcome long like! I‚Äôm going stop wearing masks get vaccine (and wait three weeks however long get shot get full vaccine effect) least started limiting indoor gatherings that's start. yes, understand.

r/coronavirus insists hates anti-vaxx, anything *isn't* beloved Oxford vaccine, exercise 'healthy scepticism' against. Masks gained wide traction SARS back early 2000s. SARS never reached West never caught here. hope COVID-19 changes now. surgeon general said thing back then. It‚Äôs wild think bet started go downhill massive table top party prague bridge. SARS 1 already found studies done accordingly. looking early stage, part necessary step create vaccine. I'm going push saying lied, perpetuated bad science. say scientist. far find, exactly zero studies ever shown masks increase risk getting virus (or virus). 

I think one, one RCTs mask use general: showed healthcare settings, cloth masks actually *increase* chance getting sick. 

The widely-alluded [Chu et al meta included RCT (as really none) 172 studies analyzed, concluded low certainty whether masks supposedly do. low certainty combing studies thousands thousands people, something astray. 

What also irks confident masks' effectiveness. Never ever seen many people purport huge robust effect exists there. messiest data people data, especially data sick people. absolutely basis certain folks like Fauci effectivity cloth masks, yet alone masks outside healthcare settings.  proven sensitivity 90% specificity 99% sold $5 strip brainer.

Currently tested less quarter population 6 months. could test half population weekly could easily get front outbreaks.

Schools, Companies concerned families would love able get ahold type testing.

Of course would like (or companies creating these) claims independently tested first Stop fearmongering. meteor could come crashing roof house killing instantly. I'm going stress it. Exactly Another positive found finally grow super patchy beard see fills time, worry looking like crazy person since mask covers it.

Of course stop wife telling shave since see maskless face everyday.  Bill, underestimate value masks all. overestimated people's intelligence. Thank much least honest. selfish don‚Äôt care others...that‚Äôs literally saying too. works country everyone guns self entitlement. Vaccines suit armor highly infectious diseases outbreaks affect even vaccinated people. example measles (which infectious covid way) sicken even vaccinated kids antivaxxers grow certain percentage community. may take combination masks vaccines really make virus go away. forever, vaccine rollout take long time, plus many idiots vowing never take Bill Gates 5G microchipper, mean vaccine. I'm thinking year looking much better, think I'll wearing masks airplane, example, 2-3 years come. put kids, adults virtuous locked home ... gradual spreading across big country, hitting population centers hit before. U.S. inevitable. watch make sure med centers overwhelmed, best do. Don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôll keep wearing mask encouraging others same. It‚Äôs easy helps. reply people twice, unbecoming. 

I dont want tell NC tiny irrelevant state guys might sane governor took measures everybody else boat. Things absolutely back normal. say deluded thing could say right makes think ever left state let alone town graduated high school in. 

Things getting better, far normal. actually ever frontline work know that. try downplay situation want say, ""bUt CaLiFoRnIa"" ignoring California population much higher NC. also largest economy country large unemployment ripple effect throughout nation. despite fox news told you, buying second house offset that. lot people actually really happy right now. perfect example.

A lot people really deluded right now. *are* perfect example. anti-maskers pointing WHO's earlier statements, pointing inconsistencies, field day conspiracies. works. putting million people altar slitting throats. shutting everything preemptively stop dying. local health departments probably charge distributing vaccines, like bird flu pandemic. remember going going schools vaccinating faculty children. Obviously masks important see comments like /u/abadlocalcommercial realize immediately best judicial systems remove emotional people making laws. imagine local coffee shop barely making busy day, minimum wage barista blanks unthinkable, serves customer wear mask.  
 
Too bad sad business owner trying make feed two kids...you get $10,000.00 fine. much? pulled ass fuck you. business customers go local Tim Hortons street. entirely true, makes USA's incompetence even clearer. US? country built individual choice government staying it. Expecting people things greater good indefinitely going happen. case Donald Trump wouldn‚Äôt President. Part issue (assuming Americans here) leadership prioritized whole economy individuals, purposely underplayed severity coronavirus. hindsight, America shut 1 month contain spread, we'd likely better place right now. consequence, parts country issued partial lockdown whereas others ignored safety recommendations. lot people caught between, wearing masks self-isolating meeting close friends family members. However, takes single slip-up within one's network trigger coronavirus spread.

Americans, whole, difficult situation many made sacrifices, singular collective action Americans tackle spread. Therefore, people made sacrifices done it, others never made sacrifices still living life like pre-COVID.

Although believe minimizing group activities mask wearing mandatory without vaccine, see others' POV isolation, simply feel need get stay mentally sane. America's failure COVID ultimately falls upon government's inability reluctance unify American people; instead, COVID politicized ensure top remain top. Can‚Äôt imagine they‚Äôll use hospitals cities. 

Most likely, they‚Äôll set big mobile units special refrigeration units require parking lots, everyone need book ahead appts, may even move units around city outer boroughs. 

In small cities could possibly use convention-center type spaces and/or armories. armories drill halls ‚Äî big empty spaces. 

(It‚Äôs producing special refrigeration units might making sweat.) wHEREas likE wATcH? Well since I‚Äôm CPA helped clients apply PPP, think I‚Äôm qualified say kind clients got money important them. 

Unlike making crap up. Trump's tape telling somebody else dangerous was.

He intentionally looked paths killing people hopes would quickly, campaign year wanted go away. get going. safe solutions isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù. It‚Äôs safely managing support plan place. Actually, calling ad hominem closer ad hominem said.

lol get matter say reject keep moving goal post. said saying pure political propaganda. literally worst fall countries, albeit NZ's fallen less many countries. they're better metric. They've strict lock longer, citizens also enjoyed freedoms longer period. importantly, one lowest COVID cases/deaths per capita.

In metrics used gauge country done, NZ comes top. NZ done well again, especially argument made relative point is, clearly winning strategy.

So is? Sweden's strategy locking saw **far more** cases/deaths per capita. Sweden's economy also much better. level 1/2 restrictions NZ similar ones Swedes face.

That said, hope realize unlike elderly NZ, elderly Swedes living homes effectively placed lock - one lifted today finally allowing visitors.

So, I'll ask again, what's winning strategy? go back many years supporting statistic, it‚Äôs still true!

2020: 51405 / 10352390 = .00497

2019: 44857 / 10281189 = .00436

2018: 48033 / 10171524 = .00472

2017: 47607 / 10053061 = .00474

2016: 46057 / 9906331 = .00465

2015: 47308 / 9793172 = .00483

In fact there‚Äôs year data linked (so since 2010) deaths per capita higher 2020. Every store around here, like every single one, sign, cashiers NEVER wear them. pulled down.

&amp;#x200B;

Funny thing is, tons local police depts specifically said enforcing mandatory mask rule MI didn‚Äôt sell bats market Sorry downvoted. sub overrun covid deniers lately. fucking hate buried comment is. people scream lied ignore sheer tsunami lies told constantly everyday governments. everything could face fast developing threat. Exactly. Driving choice, catching Covid isn't.  Yep, think actual data get clicks/views etc. media field day this, already hurting views milking shit it. saw Morning Show today telling people ""stock up"" ""2nd wave"". Shameless fucks Redditors said back April airborne droplets could get eyes. Highly recommend wearing full eye coverings glasses/goggles indoors public places.

Only country needs lockdown first stop everyone moving around! That‚Äôs brought disease first place. Damn, it‚Äôs complicated hard understand. doesn‚Äôt. Dozens - 6 Phase III. Ok, here's relevant ‚Äî Ever since coronavirus emerged Europe, Sweden captured international attention conducting unorthodox, open-air experiment. allowed world examine happens pandemic government allows life carry largely happened: thousands people died neighboring countries imposed lockdowns, Sweden‚Äôs economy fared little literally gained nothing,‚Äù said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, senior fellow Peterson Institute International Economics Washington. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs self-inflicted wound, economic gains.‚Äù Yes &amp; even that. multiple co-morbidities neighbor seems *fine* ""just getting with"". seems completely miss her, 65+, morbidly obese (climbing one flight stairs gets breath several minutes), diabetic asthmatic means likely days sniffles.

Even co-morbidity - recovering chemotherapy &amp; cancer - otherwise good health, nope risky situations Planck time. understand masks reduce amount virus take initial infection lessening severity. get low dose &amp; body fight easily, almost like vaccine right - fault chronic liar told America would magically disappear - repeatedly - lying testing availability - stealing state-purchased supplies fed telling states themselves... after, course, lying nature purpose federal national stockpile...

But know, fact, knew real threat just... lied about.

So 'triggered' - specifically point - dead Americans bullshit resulted in.

That happen.

Because world proved better America. dozens coronavirus vaccines development, primarily preclinical phase tested animals. U.S., seven vaccine candidates moved clinical trials human participants, including three moved crucial Phase 3 development 3 phase 3 trials need perfect first run through. guaranteed happen. works need approval likely get rushed. might even limited release another semi phase 3 make sure works giving hundreds millions people. 

I'm hoping one wins cheap easy produce. Even time manufacture distribute country could take months best.  Especially since people made own. Trudeau thing wrong though. going advice doctors time. Tests limited since symptoms self isolating, need test time. done? not, not? isn‚Äôt possible? looks like one day bump point, could anything. look 7 day average past months numerous days seven day average ticked general trend declining cases ticked general trend increasing. Wait days see persistent trend. Yep thanks selfish. Appreciate 2nd wave bring you. request white house process change. go source that?

Your comment make sense. Anti-Muslim, anti-Islamist sentiment, xenophobic, ethnocentric, group-selection tendencies; Caucasian cultures also demand seeing face determine ‚Äútruth‚Äù one‚Äôs words supposedly micro expressions crucial virility (at least ‚Äúso thinking goes,‚Äù though, ironically people lie plenty enough audio without anyone seeing facial expressions, difference?)

Many subconscious though cultural reasons mask usage Caucasians. Exactly. Plus, forgotten chinese expats instructed hoard masks import back China start pandemic. hoarding instructions ordered Chinese companies overseas order drain masks get back native country, resold BACK countries them, point many masks defects.

This specifically hapenned Australia, I'm pretty sure somehow global someway remember Country General Healthcare Associaction recommending use masks order avoid shortage healthcare industry (citing WHS). Maybe never related that. lot people also care Social bubbles best thing. best friends family enjoy actually hanging with-talk agree mostly see controlled settings. trust careful let know exposure feel weather-you feel good come hang house. February, Trump people said that, let's kid ourselves, would massive shitstorm he's overreacting, trying install martial law, etc. Back February official death toll 100 think. way political social nation wide shut based that.

Would worked better? Yeah.. probably. let's pretend ever option. need tag sarcasm.  Otherwise hard tell stupidity. know probably killed burned everyone right? Germany \~5 death day last week. 83 Million people, US 328 Million. So, 20 death/day would solid number US. 

It's scary see bad things US.   don‚Äôt get downvoted. makes much sense. media making people scared. one talking Sweden‚Äôs infection rate lower Norway‚Äôs? Florida went 12,000 infections day, 4,000 mask mandate ignoring ‚Äúscientists.‚Äù Yeah, enough people state want leave, it, regardless minority wants. folks move state matches political alignment. Yes, Cuban doctors remarkable work home abroad. keep mind still exploited government [sent abroad need n95 masks? masks mostly help stop sneezes contaminating surfaces infecting people much protect getting infected. 

Speaking hong kong masks used even n95 standard still made huge difference literally 100% people wear one public. empathy. comment nothing empathy I'm choosing deal virus. Big leap making thinking saying ""it's great live here"" means ""I'm glad 200k people died"" live India.The lockdown pushed people poverty hunger cause sufferings deaths dying corona virus IFR 0.2 itself.

Perhaps million Indians die let run system. Job losses , hunger , mental health, suicides due lockdowns cause millions deaths. Well got nothin, then. say buy bulk masks artificial PPE shortage created Trump/Kushner? I'm neither American, Chinese. pit grand scheme things said done? contrast neighbouring countries, Netherlands doesn‚Äôt strict facemask policy (we wear public transport). Still, spread corona virtually similar European countries wearing masks enforced much strict manner. fact, one ‚Äústricter‚Äù countries, Belgium, seen much infections last weeks Netherlands. saying shouldn‚Äôt wear masks, makes kind sceptical efficiency comes stopping spread virus. Amazing agree stupidity masks non-essential places come completely different conclusions. 

IMO there's middle ground non-essential businesses open masks. They're either non-essential we're middle pandemic that's severe open them, pandemic severe open complely. take PhD epidemiology know Starbucks open mask mandates higher risk transmission Starbucks all. 

If honestly believe eliminating COVID quickly possible best way get economy road recovery, support Australian-style lockdowns. Opening non-essential businesses simply prolongs this.

So yeah, either lock everything **hard** knowing damn well consequences are, reopen everything goal keeping hospitals capacity. That's stand. guess thankful I'm well-educated affluent area DC suburbs. incredibly rare even day see someone place business wearing mask.

What continues flummox me, however, degree people willing go sit inside restaurants area. Someone missed memo fact considered primary source spread. go restaurants ever. shuts fuck up, let professionals handle things?   yet leader still claim victory smh. Nobody disputing closely related coronaviruses retrieved animals bats pangolins either.

The original paper makes specific technical arguments. I'm saying correct, cannot say false making generic statements. That's call handwaving.

You need point specific errors original article. See mention pop up, damn memesters Bill gates says ""we"" probably means countries like US, Canada, Brazil, UK. them, matter government said, wore them.

This applies asians well. many asian countries masks debate. people countries need make excuses work recommended. seemed like common sense wear mask protect others disease respiratory symptoms.

In countries like China South Korea, proven model keeping infection numbers low, secret wearing masks. Curiously, people certain countries reluctant copy effective measures public knowledge. 

Today people America, Canada, Britain, blame leaders firm importance masks, they're honest themselves, neither keen it. didn't

\- scientists yeah, one still stupid believe said that.

also N95 good cheaper masks shocking reason; here's something figuring out, surgical mask types (and least 2 layer cloth masks) allow take wee bit virus body workout immunity without overloaded viral load.

there need vaccines masses imo, vulnerable. focus making cheap comfortable designer masks everyone giving free. wear virus strains circulation become weak years take masks people immune. years, time necessary bodies decide keep antibodies long term memory instead flushing couple months. Dear Bill, please tell Dutch government RIVM (local CDC). still underestimate value - one wears mask anywhere. yes, clearly topic. I'd expect mod team here. Trump-this shit Fauci business would still gone under. lot restaurants bars operate razor thin margins simple reality far fewer people go pandemic.

If wanted preserve businesses, set system give financial aid instead large corporations. Hey there's always next decade amount control CCP has, absolutely way privy manufacture distribution.

Sigh... Way people would need get faster rate herd immunity talking about. never works without vaccine people get immune months get again. 

This stretch many years keep killing. either get vaccine people dying COVID become common fact life people deal death Black Plague back then. China stopped counting all. numbers instantly got better. Absolutely devastating middle class. wouldnt pay it! fuck that. virus FUCKING FAULT think tested every time go grocery store? Otherwise could asymptomatic store spreading it. Here's main issue article like it. SHOW NATURAL MUTATION PATH. 

For me, weighing options; reality experts claim clear day Covid natural occuring virus, never released path mutations, relatives virus DNA, similar documented mutation paths... That's behavior cover-up. Actions words!

Since science based ""because said so!"" ???

This article claims there's genetic proof. Sweet! proceeds show genetic proof whatsoever. cites ""there better computer models there"" C'mon man! Saying make true

Just clear, never claim anyone know factually Lab made virus, still suspicions garbage news like this. Probably.

Communism stateless, moneyless, borderless, classless, society. even close those. super high mortality viruses typically spread well.  much loser attack somebody ask wear mask business business represent? 

ive almost happen several times restaurant ive at. couple tough guys size aggressively come LOL. I'm small guy means either. I'm 6'3, 215 pounds fit. id knock ass lol. 

people fucked can't happen lot goods significantly cheaper produce overseas. However, producing things like masks gowns since we've seen global pandemic whole manufacturing system. bill part ""national security"" military foot bill. way useful fighter planes cost millions produce maintain. Even dinosaur, would pick one? could stegosaurus, triceratops, raptor!  There‚Äôs anti-Fauci squad force sub. make everyone question Fauci. Guess why? Politics. I'd never heard term (I'm US) .  


""An estimated 4.1 million US-citizen children lived least one undocumented parent recent years, according [the Migration Policy They‚Äôre kids anti-immigrant groups disparage ‚Äú[anchor derogatory term insinuates children little pawns used immigrant parents get foothold US eventually become citizens themselves.

He added: ‚ÄúIn fact clear history zoonotic origin lethal coronavirus outbreaks SARS-CoV ‚ÄúThe paper Li-Meng et al provide robust evidence artificial manipulation, statistical test alternative hypotheses... highly speculative.‚Äù Fauci wants pin Trump blood thousands hands. course america isn‚Äôt absolute worst country world everybody knows that..200K deaths still FAR best especially could much better schmucks like actually defend you‚Äôre personally affected

if 120K avoidable deaths average one people 4 close friends/family that‚Äôs 480K people who‚Äôs lives affected simply due ignorance incompetent leadership..have empathy grow There's great Noam chomsky interview he's explaining editorial bias news organizations towards neoliberal statist policy presscriptions. interviewer takes offense asks really thinks editor directing positions take stories cover etc. Chomsky replies no, saying interviewer job already believe policies.

The dynamic work comes public health experts, influential scientists broadly speaking. achieve positions influence hold viewpoints benefit institutions put there. case governments' scientific advisors, means scientists likely recommend state solutions problems rather community based ones. first mind majority people immigrating from, primary subject immigration issue America. 

I born here. intend stay. find culture repugnant lack concern government's long history international crime unbearable. Imagine, shut everything 2 weeks 1 month. That's it. Buckle month. Wait everyone virus get longer contagious. Done. Over. Back life.

But selfishness stubbornness greed let easy. sustainable Federal Government abigating mandate take care citizens. could sustainable but... alas. 

But one state end pandemic. CA instance, every holiday everyone Pandemic Soaked AZ rolls help infect place. 

The alternative course, millions die so... guess hope election goes towards scientific minded candidate.  asked folks work BSL3 BSL4 labs masks work. Another milestone MAGA. Murica back top fellas I'm saying likely CCP propaganda trying stoke anti-mask sentiment US order make sure COVID much damage US possible. CCP adversarial absolutely starting expansive. look territorial disputes neighbors now. 100% interest weaken US much possible largest obstacle aims. CCP agent, already using social media spread anti-mask sentiment, first thing would recommend start fanning anti-mask flames. Wake up, Pollyanna! fix blue screen death. tell last time I've seen one. I've using Windows decades, definitely improved. decades flatten curve!

Naaa...

&amp;#x200B;

Herd immunity reached faster... Covid contagious. wont take 2 decades since growth isnt !&lt; also issue concerning definition asymptomatic versus people would eventually exhibit symptoms, currently. 

Honestly, generally pretty clear terms mean, journalist basic research able communicate points. there's much money click-bait outrage. social media algorithms tuned ""engagement,"" rather quality. that's vast majority modern day content mill monkeys produce. 

And society worse it. current leader free world resides. believe winning losing thing topic, responses would textbook example ""how lose argument"".

Now run along Daddy spank again, child. feel sorry you. want millions people die achieve herd immunity? Number 1 worldwide babyyyyyyyy America #1 AWOO! 

#BACK BACK WORLD WAR CHAMPIONS!
#MORE GUNS PEOPLE!

So **does** happen family, take seriously. key takeaway shocking example school require test coming campus; school require tests coming campus; school nothing place monitor / police student partying adherence pandemic guidelines.

In short SUNY Oneonta provided textbook example higher ed pandemic. decisionmakers responsible fired.  neighbors outside US, please send help. mortally embarrassed Trump, he‚Äôs literally killing us. many us - majority even - believe decency human kind. 

Meanwhile, remember get caught news cycles. Stay vigilant country‚Äôs leadership, too. We‚Äôre strong weakest link. 

With love, Michigan. enough smart people (in charge).

FTFY fuck tired ass joke. swear someone makes every headline like this. day 154 155

We're day 195, around 40 days ago Absolutely, corona situation depends governance public. went sideways USA, whereas countries like Germany government bit people bit, good control now. Places like South Korea, government whatever needed fast efficient, public complied even checked among themselves. Corona almost non-issue probably stay like that. Yeah take years understand fully.

It's surprising different stuff happens different countries. mean, latin europe countries similiar clones. developed differently, affect people differently.

I think voluntary, spontaneous behaviour people juuuge factor. 

Maybe Italians got much bigger scare mayhem Lombardy, slack much? much undercounted. Back first week August already 244,000 excess deaths (since March), 169,000 covid deaths reported time... killed remaining 75,000 people Antibody tests reliable, pick common cold coronavirus antibodies mistaken Covid antibodies. understand volunteers forbidden take trials recommend it, lot people change behaviour based belief (accurate otherwise) immunty could skew research results. NZ putting strict movement restriction every outbreak area, guarded gates residential area prevent movement people?

Is NZ testing entire population outbreak area? tune upto 1 million people tested day?

Is NZ centrally isolating every case, every potential case, every asymptomatic carrier every close contacts four category minimum 14 days releasing unless get two negative PCR tests results less 24 hours apart?

Is NZ running big data driven automated tracing apps Nanjing video showing?   We, least Europe, enough trained people. That's problem. problem getting logistics vaccine transport &amp; distribution getting people vaccinated places vaccination happens.

Things like done 50s 60s fought Polio Smallpox, rushed. Trump ""That's good thing. supposed hit 200K November. leadership shortened time. exceeded expectations."" Honestly, I've started getting flu shot recent years company advertising get free office work hours. Mostly really aware even thing before. Rememeber told us would 60k deaths august. even praised hard efforts limit 60k deaths august. meant 2022 thought phase 3 trials started back July would last 3 months? COVID killing people unknown disease killing people.

It's liberalism! 1. China full shit. 2. 100% set shit loose.  eat enough garlic start come pores well Right testing covid injecting someone unproven vaccine much different. could 30 people row get seriously hurt cause red flags  Also - US passes Sweden deaths per million, despite zero lockdown mask mandates Sweden. Glad kicked millions jobs nothing. Thank greatest healthcare system world. Wut...why? Go outside man. hang outdoors people without worry done right. dont understand people STILL seeing anyone. Outdoor transmission 10ft away someone unimaginably unlikely  Yeah getting way unfair protect 0,4% making 99% waste lives 2 years. Soon we're gonna say fuck willing take risk stay inside shut rest us. American watch news. really think right protest etc? protesting wearing facemasks, Biden wins going nuts next four years.  Nooo! need Indian buffet someday!  means side effects coronavirus‚Äôs impact Well Trump hasn‚Äôt got yet, right? Success books it‚Äôs likely metric really cares about. are, definitely increased drug ODs, suicides, people going hospital soon enough fear Covid something like heart attack. also truly big lift gun/gang violence June/July, sure slowed not.

Of course also likely greatly reduced traffic accident deaths year, really knows! I‚Äôm younger 21 look post history see lmao. thread showed serious problem government psyops are. know of. I‚Äôm internet stranger you. normally insult anonymous people you‚Äôve never met? Joe rogan genuinly probably one least intelligent people rise prominence. get he's entertaining people goddamn dumb. efficacy main topic trials. important parameter approval, much important figure whether side effects so, severe are.

As ethics, strict rules tests supposed performed checked ethics committee every step. test subjects fully informed testing performed consent that. no, trials humans important part medical approval. animal trials always performed see whether drug generally safe, cannot act substitute. physiology even closest relatives, primates, different enough effects seen. Hell yeah! USA NUMBER ONE! 


In seriousness that's fucked *scheduled* finish time soon expected generate enough data early release results next 1-3 months. happens, get approval emergency authorized within week. Dude perfectly safe anyone correctly relate risk events happen given year. long obvious high risk group (and fat wake call lose weight) perfectly fine. thoughts bring back testing people covid able test 50,000 day peak infections. able build pre assembled hospital less 3 weeks. also got medications delivered leave homes.

Whether force 50,000 people trial.. still 50,000. Yes there‚Äôs plenty us still homes! Personally don‚Äôt understand anyone willing risk even don‚Äôt fully understand long term effects.  many dumbasses live USA. Impossible beat pandemic. Even vaccine idiots vaccinate. ride. According literal source post, Europe 213k deaths NUMBER ONE ! NUMBER ONE ! NUMBER ONE !

BEST NUMBERS EVER ! EL PRESIDENTE NUMBERS BIGLY. think makes sense look excess deaths categories (e.g. pneumonia, heart attack) correlate strongly covid (i.e. looking cancer murder). add excess deaths official covid total. 

I month two ago increased official covid death toll 30%. would I'm get bed start particularly stressful day work. 

Looking total excess deaths valid too, prefer way. feel like way removes some, albeit all, noise data (e.g. car crash deaths down, cancer deaths due decreased medical checkups, shit hard imagine). know feel Trump?

That's Earth feels America. Except, ya know, plenty countries actually better. News days would make film ‚ÄúContagion‚Äù seem like over-the-top, slapstick comedy. 

The whole Smash Mouth playing Sturgis scene would ridiculous likely cut film. 

But happened, real. Ye Europe poorly, Europe poorly America absolutely horrifically. already heavily regulated even people genuinely need find hard time getting it. Imagine much lower would Obama... DEFINITELY would don‚Äôt even kid guess Tom Clancys Division apparently spot Meanwhile live Massachusetts can't small outdoor birthday party 4yo son family lives RI.

Everyone would fill form either quarantine 2 weeks prior provide negative test results due states travel ban.

The real kicker live border town.

If don't, we're risking busy-body neighbor seeing bunch cars RI plates, reporting it, getting everyone $500 fine.

We're talking extravagant gatherings here. 1yo June (before travel ban), two small outdoor parties fewer 8 guests. We'd likely guest list 4yo. Well unlikely impossible. adduced HIV show user asymptomatic spread long-delayed lethality means incompatible.To add third component, greater infectiousness, would apocalyptic. bear thinking about. Covid 19 real. 100% fact checked hospitals incentivized report covid deaths. private business wouldn‚Äôt they? tests inaccurate well. don‚Äôt support Trump Biden. Go ahead shit comment! Fuck anyways! Stockpiling winter? Good chance we‚Äôre going need soon. shame can‚Äôt proactive instead reactive things. ‚ÄúSource(s): Dude, trust me.‚Äù sub overrun morons. Keep fighting right thing, family get this. arent charging time doctors it'll still many peoples reach. usa stands guinea pigs largely untested rushed vaccine. Assuming vaccine actually passes trials. National League.  still resisting DH.  fair, long ago time China export revolution, hence modern day maoist countries. mean, seemed like trendy thing time since Soviet Union much bigger scale.

After unpleasantness Vietnam China thought whole thing came conclusion stupid idea waste resources. official policy changed meddling countries internal affairs vice visa.

Funny that, another good example China gradually perfecting political system. Yet people still think China today China days Mao. remember 6 months ago reading possibility 40 *million* American lives lost. number commonly told low.

Zero long term memory UK here... seem following suit like feels Congratulations That's number Americans died WW1. roughly 400,000 died ww2, they're halfway hypocrites. guys made fuss 1200 dead Americans 9/11. equivalent number dying everyday ‚Äúactually little impct‚Äù.  think it‚Äôs accelerated timeline vaccine 

Accelerated? insanely fast! fastest vaccines took something like 5 years develop approved. based known techniques. Biontech Moderna vaccines totally new class vaccines still top contenders earliest available vaccines (if disregard Russian Chinese ones skipped lot testing).

Heck, I've involved development medical electronic devices. simplest ones, used doctors nurses actually touch patient still take half year go approval process. Anything affects patient directly needs clinical trials take years. cannot emphasize much rushed vaccine. Yes, immediate need, big one, extremely rushed. That's also reason people edge anything pops immediately go panic mode (see stop Oxford vaccine testing someone got ailment 99% sure related vaccine) Thank you! also add kids (which makes time enjoyable) pick job still work home I‚Äôm living unemployment. Also pot legal state NY either hide well! Pretty sure biblical sign: lo, sugar covered graven images wild beasts shall disappear market shelves shall much wailing gnashing teeth.  ‚Äîme 4:32 Lock internet. Save lives. get ride bike paved trails time. going metro parks taking 30 mile bicycle rides summer. carry masks case stopping somewhere snack also wear neck gaiter.

The winter challenging hope walking lot then. Try park can. Sensationalist  extremely unlikely. true current generation vaccines rather hard produce. vaccines advanced development extremely easy produce. E.g. subunit vaccines require 5 micrograms protein. single 1 m^3 bioreactor produce 5 kg less month. That's enough material immunize half billion people Numbers get big get numb it. one human being. surely reach half million time vaccine good circulation.

Reminder way. Please vote dense moron November. Hopefully deaths anti mask dipshits mostly paid trolls dude, reddit lightning rod stuff like this. fun piss off, never trust comment site. [I hate keeps somehow getting include excess deaths, should, we're actually 2/3's way there.  Winter coming things might change again. Although think shit hits fan, European countries new lockdowns. Replace life death getting money broke. think really care people lives housing money. remove comments original comment thread. Trump murderer. one pulling trigger, sure hell enabling killer turning blind eye. Good ol merica We‚Äôre endgame now.  pulmonary fibrosis  Awesome, get 21 again? number also high due relatively large unhealthy population? course lack policy president.... Errrr... I‚Äôm far miserable. fact, life pretty good I‚Äôm enjoying fuck it. What's interesting Belgium, Spain UK still ""ahead"", flat curve (constant number deaths), yeah we'll ""beat"" them.

The USA resembles Latin American countries steep upward trend. Peru, Bolivia, Chile ahead US probably remain so, Yeah no. parties mislead country...  know 1/25th square km assigned us, right? 85% population live 1.5% Sweden.  Oh I‚Äôm sure. ignorant American ass actually google Victoria figure talking about. Florida guy called Ron DeSantis thinks thousands new cases ~100 deaths per day totally acceptable reopened bars. Interestingly Swedens excess death number lower reported COVID deaths. makes sense sicknesses stops spread.

If applicable US, guess number already 300 000... üò¢üò¢üò¢ Wow. hurt. Yea whole deal made think clear going suppress much data, news, etc. much could. TBH bother /r/coronavirus much, mostly full Americans blaming Trump, scaremongering headlines new potential effects, people praising China. Mostly relevant anyone America. Darwin Awards, Karma Awards, working intended. PM say recent address good example?  Yes got high score!!!! guess called ‚Äúwinning‚Äù?! family Melbourne (that probably spend much time Facebook) believe shit.

I literally heard, 2 weeks ago, mouth person Melbourne, ‚ÄúTrump taking care guys, don‚Äôt worry anything. like government, really dropped ball left us lurch.‚Äù literally within days cruise ships around world sailing again, new outbreaks Covid-19 cases board...

Did know: thing happens aircraft today. Yeah said think China purposefully released anything I'm saying looking back need consider raw impact China countries also comparative impact  Dude, china thousands trolls reddit every thread china. look post history everyone posted thread see yourself, tag know are. Thanks nitpick, trying think serious complication could, cord around neck thought would severe. realize often issue. vaccine trial matter already approved? ‚ÄúScience‚Äù backs virus known less year lifelong complications? link 40 million Covid deaths US? US population 320 million. would like, 12.5% death rate age groups assuming 100% population got infected.

You saw March? 

The highest remember seeing 3.5 million assumed lockdown social distancing implemented flattening curve. still yelling internet stranger lol I'm ashamed live country right now. That's be. yet still people think Trump making world respect us again. respected before. we're pitied laughing stock. western societies doctor population ratio range 1:100 1:500. That's enough vaccinate everyone. talk nurses job (and likely ones it). number personnel giving injections would problem, we'd probably done month two. Technically true. Omg president lied you. (Not first gonna last time) Yeah, science totally ridiculous... late fear never understood I‚Äôm pretty sure n95s gone store shelves said don‚Äôt buy masks. needed work manufacturers distributors direct new orders right places. Pure incompetence. sealed borders

it's also two islands... hard people comprehend this...

Because masks become political. things become political facts, nuance, reality secondary political point made. anti-maskers tell dangers mask wearing work. pro-maskers tell masks solution anyone shows nuanced understanding effective must anti-masker. 

You see thread. organizer? Source? No. isnt ‚ÄúBut thought coming sooner...before special date, maybe? know one I‚Äôm talking about.‚Äù - man can‚Äôt speak of. seems gets reported every couple weeks never really ""big"" deal. I've certainly trying soak sun summer since know upper-midwestern winter coming me. I‚Äôm blaming them. meant say Professor Osterholm, greatly respect, mistaken thinks saving lives gets political traction right now. insist going strictly words Fauci said, saying ""there's reason walking around wearing mask"" put people's lives risk, probably caused deaths untold numbers early pandemic. 

But say words ""masks work"", must happy that. I've India before, I'm sure least 2 meters away another person entire month (I'm exaggerating small bit). 

This always going mess there. Agree. global scrutiny, started adopting stricter distancing policies, instead continuing act like nothing going on, result. Sweden deaths per population like said. Sweden 57 deaths per 100k, Slovakia 0.7. say right entire post? ""scandal"" quite clearly overblown me. mean, Conservatives scrubbed social media sites mention charity going Liberals, seems quite telling me. deal looked Ethics Commissioner public service flag anything. thing see they're guilty trying rush program middle crisis instead taking time make sure right partner asked administer youth jobs program. think chosen familiarity instead attempt siphon money kickbacks reasons thrown around. think government run program, whole scandal really unnecessary.

The SNC interference pretty bad though. understand coming from, possibility job losses Quebec put bit scare Liberals, response stupidest thing could done. SNC guilty could be. definitely used bribes secure contracts overseas. book thrown them.

I also look Conservative scandals like G8 funding scandal, destruction public science, constant violations election laws see little difference.

I really wish Liberals would keep act cleaner though, provides opportunities Conservatives return power damage Canada. NDP guilty playing along Conservative charades. Last time helped topple Liberal government got Steven Harper country still recovering that. really wish NDP chance actually form government get away dichotomy low level corrupt government government palm big business interests, really slightly legal corruption. possible research wasn‚Äôt convincing enough someone advising nation recommend people hoard masks? many deaths Europe. That‚Äôs said, used double negative know half world chinese /s you‚Äôre okay states losing court cases violated constitution states Victoria keeping within 5km home, statewide 9pm curfew, allowing 2 hours time outdoors day tourist, worked army base Garmisch.

Precautions exist, either ignored unequivocally told stay home test results in. can't compare numbers like that, barely tested March April excellent exactly science conducted. Someone presents hypothesis, evidence hypothesis conclusion, scientific body evaluates, questions, debates work arrives consensus reject.

Censoring scientist social media, however, part process. think they‚Äôre projecting big dick reality they‚Äôre projecting big dick. That's fine, he's mask COVID denier despite media social media keeps pushing. tested everyone came podcast still does. He's simply questioned numbers response it, specifically California. problem places like Reddit. jackass post context garbage gets voted front page everyone piles lot times things seem. meme like month ago Bill Burr called anti-mask, Burr tore something. even went down. busting others balls, Reddit made seem like Burr slammed him. dude talks people, spectrum, kinds things. clapback callout culture obnoxious, especially since good portion people full shit susceptible nonsense. Sweden 13th highest deaths per million world. ""many"" statement translates 12 100. get sick? 'effect mask = 0' might true...for duration time mask off.


But soon put back on, level protection back. Additionally, mask also wearer prevent possible spread, catching droplets. bad ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Answer: fucking shit ton actually them...exhibit a....China.  started new job recently. law, masks mandatory public spaces. realize public part statement seems given private company right away mask requirements. Provided building accessible general public, masks required indoors. full office one person aside wearing one. Yup one things currently Masks going solve problems. infections occur situations people wear mask anyway students definitely going wear mask parties etc I'm saddened looking thread see everyone hop bandwagon. WHO's messaging misrepresented day 1 news outlets eaten Reddit. made big post thread early linking direct sources WHO's Q&amp;A sessions Youtube, yet people STILL responded saying wrong said. 

People harp Facebook social media, reddit bad getting brainwashed. I'm considered ""WHO apologist"" link primary sources refute ""lies"" people think responsible for. lol, keep telling boyfriend things going insane he's December. usual election insanity going 10x worse, forsee chaos election, regardless results. 

It's gonna bad time COVID too, relative now, least state. okay bf coming we've rented cabin entire month December staying fuck away everyone everything. still makes nervous. Boggles mind anyone willingly flying mess. Tell folks careful. COVID, particular. they're already prudent mask wearing social distancing, they'll absolutely need be, order avoid getting sick here. people need live lives US see everyone public wearing masks yet numbers dropping... happened too. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll fine. Exactly. People often say boss says regardless. Particularly early risking job say fuck look places wear masks courtesy common cold. f thinking?
It is. amount one said one said going bring lives back jobs back take away pain losts loved ones. going lockdown clearly precautionary protocol. evidence closing business work yet anyway. Yeah that‚Äôs 200,000 directly caused Covid-19. large percentage deaths underlying health problems attributed cause death. friends China asking ""Are Americans refusing wear masks China it?"". Lol. It‚Äôs black white paint be. Viruses extremely small. clear (and still much learn) masks especially cloth face coverings filter viruses respiratory particles. agree extremely misguided surgeon general Fauci discourage mask use. However, don‚Äôt think solid science mask/cloth efficacy, especially coronaviruses.

Masks widely taught medical students / doctors effective way control viral transmission. think failure medical community large. 

We also praise CDC reassessing data, learning mistakes, making right decision recommend universal masking. doesn‚Äôt mean lying flip-floppers. means looked data, including new data experience COVID, made change recommendations accordingly. think misread dude's comment Good luck flushing toilet 2 days. every one people arrested trespass. business owner right deny entry impose restrictions entry premises see fit (with exception denying access based protected criteria, age, sex, race, etc). business clearly stated persons premises must wear masks. not, trespassing (on property without owner's permission). people violated requirement access, trespassing. really get cut dry this.

Protesting government mandates wearing mask one thing - argue violates Constitution (you'd wrong, could least protest try get changed), saying right wear mask trumps property owner's rights (especially since people champion rights wielded certain minorities) hypocrisy monumental scale. underestimate value science.  plenty tests all.

Some people driving hundreds miles get test, happens car? live North East loads people trying get test due outbreaks can't get one. tests coming back anything like quick enough time; around 10% tests turned 'round within 48 hours. renders test trace partially useless time people tested results, 5 days symptoms time people aiming trace going business here, everywhere.

Absolute shambles. far 320 million people include legally. Even legally more. people die pandemic even every single person caught tomorrow. We've already infected 1/6th country. people less safe regardless president next year. may conflating ‚Äúscience‚Äù ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù. 

not disagree, helpful point society tending towards collapsing distinction, sadly. everyone says things like:

""the science settled"", ""data-driven"", ""evidence-based""

they're conflating science authorities

science never makes normative statements. ever antibody tests Canada? show it? What‚Äôs point story?  surprised Yelp hasn‚Äôt shut down. It‚Äôs Bing data. know exists sure why.  like Bill Gates wife. feel like really want help people. worried getting sick, stay inside protect yourself.

You're responsible you. horde toilet paper reasonable assume mask hording would've happened dangerous levels. I've calling current president ""Leatherface"" (because mind child responsible massacre Texans - oh also face looks like sewn together skin faces) maybe switch ""Thulsa Doom"". Normally people stupid shit, blame people stupid shit. know reddit, ""personal responsibility"" huge thing, still. probably better asking folks hospital increases. countries less people city, comparing absolute basis silly. know might add discussion, feel like put correct informy there. seems misconception keep spreading around.

I can't speak China South Korea since live there. Japan's case preventive measures mandatory. Even store closures state emergency REQUESTS instead orders. People shops preventive measures due fair mix social pressure self consciousness. Snip ear elastics toss masks, please! I'm 33 years, survive another year Yeah stuff too, I'm learning language, make little music photo editing. fun replacement social life. Human beings animals social interaction humans important part needs hierarchy Paywalled and/or really giving much info. 

Can explain, please? economy done lot worse similar countries contain virus? outbreak widespread lockdown worth it. That's exactly Victoria showing us, eliminated yet.

If wanna lockdown snuff out, early.  wrong, people bought many N95s could, tried sell online inflated prices.. LIE effectiveness. What's shocking, many people believed them, us seen effective masks Asia. Sitting near someone outside going high risk. Especially low Covid area like many places now. France currently indoor event limit 5000 people PM outright said lock country despite climbing cases. blame both. Sweden still underestimating masks! Tegnell, health minister calling shots, calls evidence masks ""very weak."" government even **recommending** people wear them.

Edit add video citation 5 days Japan made masks mandatory, Japan made anything mandatory, constitutionally power so. Even so-called ‚Äústate emergency‚Äù bars restaurants still fully open without consequence.


People wear masks already culture it‚Äôs highly collectivist society. #1 yet? 
Is America Great Now? probably overestimated. I'm sorry put frankly wrong. 

First one (edit: 2) candidate mRNA vaccine work. mRNA introduced viral protein translated cells stimulate immune system way giving dead virus dead bacteria would. still training immune system attack virus see's later, like type vaccine (which definition vaccine is).

""There known herd immunity covid 19"" - statement make sense. Herd immunity concept, idea certain percentage population immune future outbreaks prevented susceptible individuals isolated. Anything leads immunity (natural infection vaccine) would lead herd immunity certain percentage coverage.

Yes vaccines require high percentages population get work, herd immunity thresholds high. vaccination strategies rely herd immunity stop outbreaks populations.

Vaccines generate individual immunity correct, success vaccine programs protect vaccines work (or cannot take them) requires herd immunity thresholds reached. nothing different coronavirus vaccine sense

\-Source: PhD Immunology soon someone brought covid back another country someone travelled US it

That's countries like NZ Singapore make mandatory quarantine 14 days decide travel US.

Also, land borders US/Canada US/Mexico closed. Air travel many countries also restricted visa services suspended March.

[In accordance Proclamation‚ÄîSuspension Entry Immigrants Nonimmigrants Certain Additional Persons Pose Risk Transmitting Coronavirus, effective 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time March 16, 2020, entry United States suspended individuals, United States citizens lawful permanent residents, physically present within United Kingdom, excluding overseas territories outside Europe, Republic Ireland within 14 days travel United States. Proclamation 9993 regarding travel Schengen Area country also remains effect. traveler valid ESTA subject Proclamation attempts travel United States violation Proclamation ESTA think grossly underestimating difficult travel US. really excuse able quarantine contact trace anyone returning US considering reduced number. Oh, average is. median bites ass. ever think free nations report truthful numbers nations aren‚Äôt won‚Äôt? Absolutely. governments saw need control public health disaster, politicians saw opportunity enrich patrons big business. Disgusting Auckland level ""2.5"". Also, thought whole point supposedly perfect ""lockdown hard early, strict track trace"" policy life could return normal would little economic social downsides. Otherwise, what's point?

Edit: also found case school. Clearly sign least community transmission. ""strict track trace"" *very* hard effectively implement. American woman, stay away, tell covid, go away...  apologies guess 19-year-olds adults, barring living Greek houses would treating like children would probably party elsewhere anyways. Take sister goes different school barred living sorority house, forcing scramble find place sublet months' notice. quarter started yet, says girls already made plenty plans hold parties elsewhere.

Yes, universities care money anything else like every business. argument like saying environmental crisis companies responsible polluting cared environment. true misses bigger picture. amazing entire country Italy better than, say, state like Missouri (1837 new cases, 26 deaths) even though got 10x population. May ask time wearing those? remember Bernie/Biden suspending rallies time got serious US. October 21st gives impression we're possibly one month away re-opening border. We're not.

It's kind hard make solid plans future constantly strung along lead believe border might open moment.

Setting possible open date farther future help hammer home people situation going miraculously resolve ~30 days. also gives government opportunity extend deadline even without last moment. They'll know long Jan 1 border closure needs extended. blatantly obvious long time situation going resolve 30 day timeframe. time stop pretending will. much easier people, businesses governments plan effectively uncertain future least give certainty. Knowing border continue closed extended period sucks. However, much better false hope ""might"" open soon. Curiously surprise, neighbors recognise despite mask. Maybe way dress 1. bs article, normal side effects vaccine. 
2. russia ""Central east asia"". stans, part FSU, Central Asia, Russia considered Europe North Asia. What's odd tags recently? Thank goodness one panicked though, right? really amazing stupid people are. pandemic, always wore masks whenever got cold job give enough sick days recover home. People work would give weird looks including coworkers even tho explained wearing mask prevent spreading cold them. they're freaking people REFUSING wear masks public lol get issue damage lying public, really do, let tell you, Canada, incredibly stressed husband, physician, basically make sure clinic staff enough masks continue see patients person could virtual visits. incredibly stressed former nursing colleagues, work daily diminishing supply still keep vulnerable populations (paediatric oncology) safe.

To me, bigger issue public (enhanced occasional minimizing attitude elected officials - looking you, Premier Doug Ford ""Go, enjoy March Break plans country {thousands go Florida every break}, cool) willing stay tight home. home = need mask frontline.

I mean, course things done guarantee masks completely wiped early on; see toilet paper?!

Also, general public seems understand point science always trying learn new, better ways something. gets label ""SEE?!?! KNOW BETTER US!!"" referred ""Novel"" reason, everyone keeping ""truth"" public, constantly trying learn, relay learned information. China went round world buying stocks masks mask material January hated time period reddit everyone bought lie hook line sinker people telling idiot begging people wear masks least corrected dig heels it. Dark. true. Define ""high number"". percentage-wise? per million wise? arbitrary definition means ""more 1"" anyone could interpret please?

In layman terms, even every single person entire world got COVID, extremely low number (0.1% 1%) die.

So no, high number kids die. They've never seen someone die ARDS wasted lockdown March-April.

Even then, likely late. virus America since Nov/Dec, didnt tests detect it.  patently false

How patently false? mean keep saying like parrot. logic stating Otherwise people making claims daily kinds happens every single day, even scientific journals. hope absolutely ridiculous ones would rejected publication that's always true.

Also selectively quoting literally portion sentence...? Um? know bogus claims made, based anecdotal evidence time time. But, means obligated believe unless peer reviewed and/or repeated least one person similar qualification subject assume scientific background?

Assumed wrong. us scientists.  want ask ""to where?"" suppose common sense answer send large regional hospitals since people want vaccinated first anyway.

When tractor trailer truck load go bridge, street, pretty much anywhere fit. 

When truck hauling load can't go bridges, can't take certain roads narrow excessive foot traffic, can't go roads grades steep safely go down. 

When truck hauling oil, liquid nitrogen, hazardous material introduces restrictions go. 

When truck hauling wide-load warning signs lights put it, generally lead and/or follow car. 

When truck hauling nuclear waste might get armed escort. 

There might loads demand roads shut might armed land air escorts. 

The risk involved truck load indescribably different risk involved truck hauling nuclear waste. 

If no-load truck gets horrible accident heavy likely mean people die, that's horrible.\* damage casualties low load. might hit vehicles momentum keep going. truck driver, truck, occupant(s) vehicle(s) hit, vehicle hit, likely nearby trees structures. 

If nuclear waste truck gets horrible accident people die wrecked vehicles. barrel dozen vehicles slowing down, waste spills ""grab mops hoses"".

I‚Äôm glad dialed unwarranted arrogance back corrected statement, even wouldn‚Äôt wrong anymore. Awww geeee Rick hope they‚Äôre ok.............. 90% people know dead, maybe reality different. People still lied Trump... least CDC corrected error. what? Become doctor instead, slaving away every single hour rotations juggling 3 hours sleep, eating quick meals, social life years, study tests rotation work get treated like child peers?

No matter do, shitty treatment, various different soul crushing ways. Disgusting. Americans fucking sociopaths. No.

then happened cause lockdown? suffering Duning-Krueger Today physicists talk alternate timelines, living simulations, universe splits every time wave function collapses, fanciful nobody accuses anti-scientific. 

Are putting ideas forward theories, conjectures, fact? think petitions place, also flaws. would make sense anyone circulating petition would collect opposing signatures well... becfaor side effects common pretty much every vaccine. surprise getting poked muscle makes sore instance raised temperature indicates immune response kinda point it. Could please link source claim? preliminary data long-term effects floating around seems contradict saying. Also healthy athletic people spoke got thing seem contradict - recovering fun heard. Again, non-concern one's life consists driving bar TV+couch home us bit broader aspirations life. optional

Masks already optional lol, wake year-long coma something? US deaths per population even get readers plain glass lenses

Well that's perfect need prescription glasses. mean widely available. ramp much sooner risk populations. financial pressure. pay bartender he's baito closed. lost income social security back march.

It cheaper close pay electricity bill (and god forbid, employees) empty bar. Every day February loss us, least closed bar zero. Begg says report draws conclusion difference overall incidence laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases fails mention Sweden's leading epidemiologist Anders Tegnell paused collection data children thought would create anxiety among public.

I can't find information pausing collection data children would create anxiety among public. find bit hard believe tbh, someone find source would like read it.

The report addresses problems Sweden's scarcity test Sweden much affected pandemic Finland show incidence among children. likely many mild cases children Sweden never detected since testing week 12 22 mainly focused persons seeking hospital care. Sweden, outbreak investigations limited regions highest number cases due strained resources. contact tracings primary schools Finland, hardly evidence children infecting persons. Swedish comparison number reported cases among staff day care primary school number cases professions show increased risk think conflating timeline things. anti-mask sentiment pretty strong around mid-late February early March. TIME Italy's gigantic outbreak first confirmed US cases. pretty quickly corrected.

Health leaders clue, specific point time, severity outbreaks US. Case numbers relatively low, also much information incubation period time.

Couple real propensity humans hoard stuff, KNOW fact people back January/February keeping China's news, health officials backed really bad corner.

They caught between

A. Tell public need masks, financial support government get (i.e. Government would supply them, would pay them, would produce due reliance China making them, supply shared citizens doctors/nurses etc emergency supply low), hoarding would occur or..

B. Tell public masks important panic buying ensues.

I need also hammer home point US overly relying China PPE like masks, gloves etc years, know it... first place virus breaks is... CHINA! Pascal's mask. business revoke anyone‚Äôs invitation such, trespassing police called. simple sign ‚ÄúEntrance without mask considered trespassing‚Äù, wouldn‚Äôt take many cases heavy fines mask plus trespassing would get idea across pretty quickly.

No need employees directly confront anyone. Appearantly help enough implement drastic measure - according RIVM. agree them. Ok. you‚Äôre selfish ethically medically then. 

Saying I‚Äôm selfish wanting everyone follow medical advice laughable. I'm one responding to, I'll take stab one I've thinking lot lately.

For would mental health limit. I've dark suicidal-adjacent thoughts year ever before. that's partner live love much. people isolating everyone even live-in partner with. They're cut human contact. healthy extended period time. speaking, I'd say limit seriously falling dark state, possibly actually taking self-harming action total hopelessness.

That's perspective. Maybe, commenter said, princess-y one. üéä CDC chief testifying today vaccine won‚Äôt likely widely available US third quarter late second quarter 2021, Trump says, ‚ÄúNo, think made mistake said that. It‚Äôs incorrect information.‚Äù ‚ÄúI believe like 50/50 split. ***still*** hear many people saying things along lines ‚Äúthe experts don‚Äôt even know masks work.‚Äù Fauci screwed us hard. didn't. wish could witness. deserve suffer what's coming.  Can't wait see fucking planet die already. go! can't believe big difference wearing glasses made study. Who?  correct. Sweden proved without lockdowns keep businesses afloat deaths comparable countries locked down. 

Meanwhile median time spent nursing homes dying 6 months. statistically speaking, 50% people nursing homes alive March dead today, COVID not. Considering 40% US COVID deaths nursing homes, plus countless deaths elderly people outside nursing homes, seems like fair assessment say majority people died COVID would died regardless. see now. Here, went found official confirms 79 active cases correct number. Apparently generic google response read earlier stating 24 totally wrong. bit confusion first Canada masks corrected course May people listened.

That's bizarre thing GOP....they could corrected course point. STILL that. won't. Yeah, come on, downvote pathetic monkeys.  Take photo say ""when die Covid, ones left photo remember"" Yeah, mom also spewing shit virus suddenly disappearing election, even USA one, instead tiny tiny country mere 3 million people - Lithuania. Lunacy people absurd lol Bunch hickbilly little donny cultists teeth brain cells.  Wait, Ms. Maisel new episodes?  realize sources cited much nuance you‚Äôre coming knowing read saying Tests done hospitals near 90% accurate.

To leave context numbers disingenuous best; actually read search post links thought helped prove point? Funnily enough, see way - thought sentiment ""healthcare workers probably going end getting it, wearing masks would prevent transferring people/other patients sick"" which, given way essential workers trod upon, seem outlandish.

Also whole staying home thing. much point wearing mask staying home like supposed to. total two studies archives

I'm calling bullshit claim.

We get live data watching places mask mandates versus places without. called Bayesian analysis. group think spread COVID more? Think really hard. Florida created refuge people can't get shit together. ain't happening. problem aren‚Äôt middle. want places like gyms, rock climbing, bowling alleys restaurants open limited capacity. That‚Äôs middle ground. fail see shuttering thousands businesses year middle ground. distance wear mask. Let live life. don‚Äôt think tense much getting shots. always see getting ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù LOL. know, meet parents grandparents zoom enjoy life normally. European contexts Modi would labeled fascist. put group's collective intelligence together they're almost nearly smart young sloth. Um...No. need go work thw first weeks march 30% swabs positive. Today 1.5%.

Well scale that's 20x factor, like 30k daily cases. addition first wave localized 4 regions 20, numbers less spread whole country. Vietnam: nobody per million. last two times tested, double nostril, shoving way brain. Seems accurate brain-poking one. welcome change. Whatever.  don‚Äôt know would‚Äôve totally killed it. It‚Äôs thought it‚Äôs since last nov/dec gave 4-6 months really spread point. mention many asymptomatic spreaders would‚Äôve never known 100% agree. People can't admit racist made correlation. I‚Äôm less interested fining businesses, unless it‚Äôs repeated egregious. Didn‚Äôt notice someone walking store? problem. big sign refusing enforce masking mandates? Yeah don‚Äôt business license anymore, sheriff along padlock doors.

We absolutely coming like ton bricks individuals refuse mask indoors crowds. societies done largely avoided mass deaths economic pain we‚Äôve suffered.

A weeks six months house arrest seems like light punishment potentially dozens cases negligent homicide, happen spread covid widely. Ive never seen wear mask interviews does. Two. BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna mRNA vaccines. Isn‚Äôt exact ‚Äúdeath panel‚Äù decision conservatives afraid of?  answer question. I've never experienced shock resentment all. Even whole thing. always been.. ok.. prefer wear mask, that's business.

I said ""unobstructed."" think reasons matter reasonable something proper reason thing would stupid different reason.

Yes, *cost* side cost-benefit analysis exactly regardless. say wear times, need wear able keep distance.

Yeah that's much better. Everyone see Sweden's success, quietly emulating strategy refusing admit disastrously wrong. red hats! count USAs excess deaths covid death puts 757 deaths per million compared Belgiums 856 deaths per million copying USA great tactic /s Link says none disagreeing general argument, 34% American homeowners mortgage debt (paid bought cash).

What % total homes 34% own. report said 150m homes mortgages. clear meant 150m homes analyzed 150m (76%) mortgages. 

Quick Google says ~120 million households US. 197 million coming from? (150/76%) recently road FDA Relatives Hong Kong telling resistances masks run SARS hit fan city became ground zero

It long ago, many people still bear memories days first hand experiences, unlike survivors Spanish flu relegated tiny minority caring poverty global pandemic?

Spent life poorest state country, lost health insurance way rest country. deal effects poverty every day, pandemic no, lockdown no. seriously want care people making ends meet? Where's anger McConnell senate Republicans passing aid lower class Americans? Where's anger seeking M4A people actual access healthcare TIME. poverty argument lockdowns selfish bullshit seeks gloss god awful leadership we've country rather actually help working class. somebody KNOWS poverty take shit elsewhere. blowhards chose from? keeps inside, cool. Everyday media updates cases swear I‚Äôve heard 4-5 deaths Toronto last 3 weeks/ month elderly nursing homes Prolife death cult

Totally. people bio terrorists give damn kill family. sane countries assholes would locked jail.  mean one mask, could cost 10$? You‚Äôre posts backup claim pretty well. But, claims. Enjoy hermit life. tell works

Everything, literally systems work of, human made. Money value put value it. agree that? Yes no? still can't believe arguments people fact here. People insisting masks absolutely nothing. understand people desire educate believe whatever told powers-that-be. No, called knowing vaccine trial process works running gut. probably read they're running phases parallel getting funding support record time making sure skip steps. There's also small issue fact there's never level urgency vaccine past, level combined global commitment, mention mRNA vaccine technologies come nearly far past. 

If really think serves Pfizer Oxford University well destroy reputation skipping steps around safety push vaccines might kill people, really know say - multi-billion dollar companies world's elite university, whose long-term reputations rest vaccines' safety.

This sub really thinks world revolves around Trump rushing vaccine fact every country world accelerated process respective candidates - there's also fact vaccine side effects present 5 years later like people seem think, effectively 9+ months testing (from March/Phase wide 40,000+ Phase IIIs end year) provide significant level comfort safety. Simply saying 'most vaccines take 5 years' ignoring obvious reasons (funding, processes run sequentially, lack urgency) incredibly basic. people disregard lockdown used early long. Lockdown act people going out, policy tool government. Botching implementation much worse lockdown all. Argentina 4 times population Sweden 7 times total covid cases, amount deaths Argentina growing. walk back convalesced  mean cost? Saving lives kinda number one priority society basic human empathy, mention also economically smart thing do, deaths good economy. There's winning pandemic mitigating damage much possible, regards New Zealand out-classed US many times over. lose far lives per capita, economic recovery also far harsher longer, literally lose-lose solution went with. New Zealand's story over, country's is, clear countries heading right direction one's not.  Thank you. I'll check out. ok got tested. I've seeing covid tests shove long q-tip way nose brain (ok brain). looked super painful. scheduled test today swabbed nostrils, never shoving way there. accurate, new way testing it?? president going people criticize him. Obama got attacked type mustard ate color suits. 

That mean ok president royally screws kills tons Americans hurts economy. whatever want, Im preparing inevitable fact people wont. link post? I‚Äôm happy learn something change I‚Äôm wrong 1 7, holy shit mean... we're going wear masks forever?! literally misinterpreting CDC said.  coordinated people change entire narrative subreddit hanging /new day. Go look /r/conspiracy. 100 upvotes post forced hysterectomies (now that's one hell conspiracy). 1.5k+ Joe Rogan debate. That's coordinated movement change narrative. 4chan never stopped raiding. .win raiding sure. Reddit greatest disinfo weapon game.

One thing necessarily lead other. count USAs excess deaths covid deaths Belgium still ahead  I'd say want people knowing. lol. Yeah, could useful narrative of, ""we're going vaccine time soon let's change conversation."" real. anything think it‚Äôs done harm gave credence anti mask idiots fringe groups due people trusting govt anymore reliable honest source is. According civil law, might able sued civil damages.

This interesting. someone gets long lasting damages health broke... shows US decreasing deaths/day, no? notice say mask ‚Äúalmost nothing‚Äù. problem. turn almost nothing nothing, act surprised people actual nothing (no mask). 

A bad mask better mask, every time. Speak yourself. he's type stuff years? literally none answers original question. Thanks though LoL Cloth masks vary efficacy, make buy now, cloth masks seal better, filter better surgical masks. Still N95s MOPP gear, better gaiters single ply cloth masks. went get tested Coronavirus, like regular flu last year, you‚Äôd probably find you.

Huh? Coronavirus =/= influenza virus also first discovered near natural reservoir country another coronavirus also emerged naturally. see reason believe additional layer complexity (naturally occurring escaped lab) reasonable explanation. Occam's razer seems lead natural conclusion SARS1 MERS. People going stop complying masking + distancing well there's vaccine. Especially ""SeCoNd WaVe"" never materializes, feel like people going holidays. mean, would actually great one, there's way I'm taking Russian vaccine - absolutely anti-vax. people sell Lmao almost twice many deaths per capita Sweden also excess mortality accounted news good others less good.

Bad news:
Schools reopened yesterday jump might still happen situation safe see numbers two three weeks

A days ago 2200 active outbreaks country

Still getting many daily new cases illegal immigrants rescued mediterranean sea

There significant ongoing local transmission

Good news:
tests 100k daily lockdown maximum 60/70k

testing numbers refer swabs, many serologicial tests performed daily

In areas approx 40% ""new cases"" linked previous cases discovered contact tracing

There 2200 active outbreaks extreme concentration regions, helps healthcare system

The numbers went people came back vacations, expecially croatia, spain greece.. imported cases low vacation time anymore Masks new used 1918 flu pandemic. Additionally cloth masks made effective almost like N95 using pantyhose makeshift elastic make tight seal. researched 1980s way protect people nuclear fallout.

CDC dropped ball initial messaging. originally thought symptoms can't spread, so...no symptoms = mask. IMHO cautious assume got results 15 minutes clinic good insurance Fair enough. central bank expects economy contract 4.5 percent year, revision previously expected gain 1.3 percent. unemployment rate jumped 9 percent May 7.1 percent March. ‚ÄúThe overall damage economy means recovery protracted, unemployment remaining elevated,‚Äù Oxford Economics concluded recent research less damage caused pandemic played Denmark, central bank expects economy shrink 4.1 percent year, joblessness edged 5.6 percent May 4.1 percent short, Sweden suffered vastly higher death rate failing collect expected economic gains. Pay attention research. I'm mommy. Yeah, we've essence eradicated many diseases domestically. Like 20 so. might ""gone"" world wide, theres like zero chance catching Rubella domestically - vaccine provided essence herd immunity. i'm parent school age child, one know gotten chicken pox anymore. listen 41 minute mark, Caputo admits struggling 2nd grade math, talking difficult teach daughter 2nd grade math.

Literally best people charge. ***The Best.***  forget aerosol spread. Hangs around air hours less functionally virion free floating airstream Wow, suppose dozens scientists conducted, peer reviewed, systematically reviewed studies *missed* possibility reached totally wrong conclusion dozens separate occasions. Good thing you‚Äôre set ‚Äòem straight. Same, certainly ""underestimate masks"" made r/Masks4All March. Wtf no. Q3 starts July. 

Don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs relevant work hospitality industry. Q3 always starts July ends September could said ""minor side effects"" would correct. Sure, people know see say 'that's lot!""

The article fine propaganda arm - probably means worse they're reporting. leaving home sick cold, stomach bug, liver cancer, UTI, sore throat, HIV, Zika virus. said ""sick all"" please lie pretend mean sick anything. 

Here exactly said.
""Stomach bugs"" usually eating something bad. contagious. Liver Cancer, contagious. UTI, contagious unless sex person. 

All things said varying symptoms and/or degrees common cold flu. contagious, yes. That's point. People still go living ailments even though prove deadly some. Yet, nobody suggesting criminal civil penalties that. Enter coronavirus bullshit suddenly everyone self righteous viral expert... like you, example.

You still answered original question: going treat colds flus like coronavirus, since *all* deadly people? empathy quite extend far? answered arguments that's ""different"". We'll get vaccine

Like 30% USA never get vaccine, mask usage definitely go there's way hell ever returning pre-mask times. 

Welcome Earth, bud! You... rational person. Thank rational! Yep attitude helps virus much. Damn right.

Some people still are. Pfizer deal government deliver 100 million doses end year think manufacturing problem think logistical problem getting doses out, gets many, gets first. Sorry that. new me, haven‚Äôt seen thread.

EDIT ‚Äî took snarky comment towards topics regurgitating info allowed sit far long. Maybe moderators overwhelmed. Sorry again, bad day. Holy shit insanely authoritative Seems like mid 2021 point this

Some tickets refunded people summer 2021 mind, believe google said employees work home summer 2021, even r u p CDC guy Redfield said Q2 2021 vaccine reach Americans Uh yeah guy Nova Scotia went killing spree time may also missed. did. think multivitamin? back claim, back yours? ;) seems track pretty darn well. keep thinking Florida (where I'm currently staying) huge elderly population, massive tourist destination domestic international tourists, taken pretty ""half-ass"" approach virus, i.e., one last issue state-wide lockdown, state-wide mask mandate, one first reopen, etc. (Remember Florida spring breakers going kill everyone state back March?) virus *should* force early logic yet Florida (along rest South) see real meaningful action (at least relatively speaking) June peak mid-July. state Georgia even extreme terms hands-off approach virus seems followed pattern Florida. believe pretty much earliest state reopen following brief lockdown. Local mask mandates banned governor. again, saw relatively little action June peak non-European countries picked looking map world identifying countries Central South America reasonably close equator. went back added several additional countries sides equation (while graph gets pretty busy), basic pattern seems mean, I'd love see rigorous study eyes logic telling there's probably something claim climate-based seasonality differences, likely little something. one contests masks effective

How lucky social circle face idiocy.. still bad even hour two outside Toronto. Collingwood prices averaging close half million, that's 90 minute drive Toronto. No. It‚Äôs hospital protocol across country decades wear masks ppe dealing people contagious viruses. He‚Äôs infectious disease doc, people excuse

Also people already hoarding masks shipping relatives China long before. Anyone brain realized bullshit statements masks were. It‚Äôs common sense barrier kind gonna protect Canada badly, seems rather fluke point.

I mean, made mistakes, health ministers still shut country quickly, encourage social distancing, made bars restaurants close, reduced maximum group capacity.

It fluke, strong response early on.

Now, back mask issue. Personally think messaging always hard truth. ""Masks best bet, need limit supplies public buy make sure medical professionals get access high risk situations. However, use cloth masks limit spread.""

I sympathize difficulty decision. Look happened toilet paper supplies based hint going hard get. Individuals calm, society large panics. resource hoarding occurred masks bet sure we'd lot dead doctors nurses we'd situations harder treat sick.

Was right decision withhold information, personally think so, people acting like broad, malicious action taking consideration difficult sorts decisions make ramifications things go sideways.  Yes yes, I‚Äôm saying go get tested shit 2019, like flu, you‚Äôd test positive even today still viral fragments blood still. Depending test type test positive, aren‚Äôt infectious symptoms. Bill Gates comments throw away iphone delete facebook. worries. Thanks civil convo! Lol actually believe that? mean... let's start 2% number. actually think every single person who's contracted virus gotten positive test? makes think outcome exactly like Sweden's (who's achieved herd immunity)? Lol  It‚Äôs intentional. Florida specifically excluded heart attack stroke death counted covid death. article Miami herald this. Unfortunately claimed exactly excess deaths registered 2020. 
Some nation like Italy Spain report cases worst days enough tests, places hospitals possibilities record everyone dying. possible see excess total deaths data collected John Hopkins University official COVID cases 36 nations: US going fast (696 deaths per million) still far Italy (832 per million).  begs question, feel need place personal blame COVID deaths people, apply standard every disease March?

Well, think alwaws done contagious diseases kill people?

I read story Spanish flu - much worse corona killed young people let old alone.

A doctor go see patients time. goes home wife two children. stay home, see nobody him. get sick, die span 4 days. happened real. 

The doctor think ""nature happens"". killed family, scarred life. can't shrug ever coughed public? know end asymptomatically spreading transmittable illness killed someone line?

Well contagious killer diseases around life time. 

If think would honestly can't wrap head around people like you. university students staff volunteered on-campus want participate distance learning. threat known accepted.

I curious? phenomenon curiosity baffle you?

I get run risk education, premise whole thread somebody - - writing students give shit getting it. 

So phenomenon interests me, ask questions it. 

It's weird care giving somebody else. would heavy burden people's conscience. I‚Äôve lucky enough work home this. would gladly given $200/day somebody else contributed food pantry paid grocery delivery fees seniors done sensible plan. country doesn‚Äôt value working class logic. It‚Äôs devastating see every individual is. Shit like going make people say ""why bother then."" know Illinois lockdown put place March, expressly conditioned vaccine end condition. want move goalposts like ""wellllllllll actually might ever effective vaccine."" reaction people going be, ""oh no, guess social distance wear masks forever,"" going ""oh, well sucks, time go back normal then, guess, oh, we're also voting recalling politicians try keep us locked anymore.""  1. Well New Zealand island nation it‚Äôs naturally easier contain something. 

2. US aggressively did, accident, Sweden softly, purpose.  

I ridicule Sweden like do, I'm convinced strategy work. interested see though. wife American dumbass, relevant discussion? March. Even catch they'll simply play mental gymnastic call common flu fever. agree realize conspiracy noob here. Nevermind. live San Francisco. 

We've opened hair salons gyms.  gets pass roasts Trump. 

Fauci better South Parks Captain Hindsight. think imagine average reddit user continue asserting science requires consensus. Science independent consensus. Science often ***challenges*** consensus.

I suspect might understand word means, understand completely misunderstood science fundamental level. Lol nice literally proven quite effective mitigating risk infection...And decades. stock market high! lock-down hard NZ? 

anyway, share link verify claim, please? hate warm weather summer Nebraska, I'd move Vermont could. misread colors, misinterpreted Mexico. mistake. simply added word ""only"" ""1 7"" indicate cool say downside wearing it? Yeah least do. hurt unless already hit hard rona got bad asthma.. Wow, planet living on? straight misinformation. Everywhere apart couple countries got control. India, Europe, South America, Africa, Middle East got COVID spreading rapidly still places worse America. primary reason India ‚Äúbetter‚Äù population incredibly young. number infections still enormous go asymptomatic don‚Äôt get tested they‚Äôve aren‚Äôt seriously sick.

Keep living fantasy land makes feel better though. Yes, Generation Covid going suffer greatly. Luckily, EVERYONE suffers, measures place readily available EVERYONE. Like maybe seeing therapist every month become norm, free charge, maybe even mandatory some, like seeing family doctor cardiologist. It‚Äôs small minority population suffers greatly fix issues.  ""didn't achieve perfection""... still found time dismiss/eliminate position responsible oversight... 

Hmm... Germany's population density 240 people per square kilometer, Italy's 206 people per square kilometer lived countries, tell absolute certainty Germany far efficient organized regards believe would balance out.

This take away point would take 3 years vaccinate everyone even able vaccinate 100 thousand people per day, wanted say 100 thousand people per day much unlikely number.

(I'm Italian I've never US, know big dense Texas is.) People literally shot telling customer wear mask.

The solution surrender let anyone flout mandatory mask laws employee standpoint almost lose lose. Engage risk safety risk COVID.

If lose-lose, might well pick option stands random violent fucknuts trying bully people trying uphold public health. You‚Äôre agreeing last guy. 

He saying wrong ever doubt masks effective are. 

You saying plenty good reasons doubt cloth masks specifically, amount certainty large effects expressed unscientific. 

Your first paragraph bit misleading that‚Äôs youre still upvoted despite content agreement dogma admit, wrote poorly worded, easily misinterpreted statement expect people either understanding English, much less grammar, interpret thoughts. sweden sparsely populated isnt even comparable US disease spread staying 6 feet apart taking mask drink eat shit virus proven mostly airborne. takes one person sitting spot without mask another person coming sitting spot them. 
Of course working kids school riskier bars restaurants. Bill Gates opinion coronavirus matter? It‚Äôs timing. Places got hit first weeks undetected community spread always going end worse matter did.  guys really dont always best everything. /S people idiots that's why
 try defend  Yep High mortality long, asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic incubation periods pretty uncommon. impossible, uncommon. Even half stay asymptomatic half get really/sick die, that's still much easier contact trace. probably get compliance really high mortality virus too. article subject thread already goes problems specific person's paper. want quote article something?

I'm saying ADDITION shredding paper scientists, also right-wing media blitz, casts doubts motivations scientific ethics. 

Again, that's ADDITION paper problems discussed article thread based. It‚Äôs pretty sad pandemic everyone fends instead working together get rid thing. whole world affected. 2-3 countries. lies deception stop want get rid covid. good options more. choose one least bad - risking other's lives, livelihoods, time spent alive. Neither one fully ""good"". expected better country. sort shit make everybody‚Äôs blood boil: CFR instead IFR project death totals wrong, misleading, dangerous. sent via CNN.

7 million Americans dead....STFU. tired misinformation coming sides. medical experience thought mask stuff bullshit Economy experts telling us since March ""lives vs livelihoods."" want save economy, get virus control. try downplay virus, end losing money long run. movie ""Tenet"" latest case study us believe this. ""Over three weeks, *Tenet* made than[ $207 million healthy number given circumstances.

It‚Äôs work common good type system. say anyone half brain didn‚Äôt underestimate CDC said it? sentiment ‚Äúbelieve science‚Äù, call people idiots believing worlds top experts field? can‚Äôt ways. Since clearly remember saying that, surely provide source saying ""masks work"". Bold prediction, considering vaccine fully tested approved yet.

*Edited clarify multiple vaccine candidates.* Yup. Great news indeed. Masks lockdowns. one college player dies, shut keep powering it? heart stuff little scary. Right on. contrary think Trudeau set really good example stage pandemic. Tests time scarce, safest thing assume also infected self isolate. test came back positive.....you‚Äôd self isolate anyway wait symptoms. ‚Äúpresumptive positive‚Äù phrase used. 

Let available testing saved use people symptomatic known contact (is corona not) admitted hospital/care home (what protective measures need patient). 

And comparing world leaders. Oy. Makes look much better again.

The masks - yeah. should‚Äôve told everyone least use T-shirt mask day fuckin one. Google T-shirt ninja. should‚Äôve official demonstrations *that*. recall first response extension March break bust sewing machine make masks old clothes since going store advised too. think could use fewer lawyers people government service public administration backgrounds. lawmakers drawn ranks lawyers partially gotten government current state. Except easy pres. many times say ""invoking 'P'"" never did? Oh fuck life. supposed get married July 2021. Redfield reliable IMHO fuck fuck fuck. miss hugs friends üò≥ (some underlying issues) vaccine ready December earliest. Thanks captain obvious Seems studies show happen small number people brain damage cause stroke. thing didnt understand yes didnt want cause shortage PPE healthcare workers, people wearing masks early healthcare workers would treat fewer patients. Thereby protecting them.

I still cant forget *Surgeon General* even Fauci saying masks werent necessary. absurd. lied to, kept believing lie talking freedumb long stated masks vital preventing spread. ‚ÄúQ: people diabetes higher chance experiencing serious complications COVID-19?

What point trying make? helping bolster argument. 2.7% chance reach pass phase 1 humans

A 2.7% chance means would expect 1 every 40 stories succeed! I'll take odds, especially volume research done.  Yep, fall/winter going suck hard one way another. Lots people done ""not socializing"" thing, start meeting people inside, going disaster. Mate, I'm talking Australia New Zealand, Florida. Go white!  Yeah, that‚Äôs terrible photo article. haven‚Äôt close someone, much less shook hand, since February. üòÇ scares kids catching school spreading homes communities. Esp since many asymptomatic little kids great hygiene social distancing.

I'm teaching mine home school open plenty kids attending. expect see spike upper Midwest soon, right time flu season cold weather. God help us all. fuck still doesn‚Äôt paper towels Clorox? think need update talking points...ask boss CCP December. think opened, entire states didn't. live podunk where, take grain salt ones 20%-50% person already hiring bunches substitute teachers cover gotten covid. can't force kids get tested gradually bigger bigger mess. people care infecting others?

Like infected teacher died. parents, well older person touch with. janitor.

 judging, interested people think that. primary doctor? Better go route ask internet forum. Thank you, didn‚Äôt catch Especially covid times!  ones reported relapses medical anomalies body produce store anti body formula cells induce immunity.

Incorrect. actual study found re-infection happens 

There proof re-infection (above) widespread virus ever reached herd immunity without vaccine. 

What proof herd immunity achieved without vaccines? else ever take logic ""no cost great save lives""? Traffic fatalities US probably take life-years every year covid, suggestion getting cars road, dedicating lanes transit reducing driving (measures much less disruptive putting entire population house arrest) invites scorn autocentric culture. study looks period May-August. anyone know rough dates summer holidays Germany? sort attendance like period? wouldn‚Äôt need prove conclusively something didn‚Äôt go wrong restart trial. person transverse myelitis likely outcome fail definitively ascertain cause - usually happens TM. case imagine would normal restart trial maintaining vigilance. happens imagine trial would shut down. not, regulators data. real puzzle.

Up DK notice Italians changed behavior. ZERO european tourists now. Even period borders open wide corona either Italy.

Normally loads Italians CPH, havent seen single one since March.

So least people avoiding longer travels. take meaning precaution there. like testing gonna free anyone wants Go green  doctor recommending testing least once, spouse fucking positive? top probably also helps spreading misinformation; trusted, lot leading people institutions connected WHO, there's trustworthy people/institutions left. People always liked shit America, yeah. 

But something else entirely, 200,000 preventable deaths ""great"". Third quarter? Well damn goes 2021 too!  Slurp back up. Can‚Äôt waste good coffee mention nonsense probably written Russian troll farm... underestimated power stupidity.   awesome. That's interesting. TWiV? Canada suddenly local numbers ate trending students returning town loud obnoxious parties..... think conflating ""we know everything disease"" ""unprecedented harm"". studies show massive levels thrombosis, risk Covid. true viruses cause endothelial harm   

"" (para-)influenza, adenoviruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV), polio virus, echovirus, measles virus, mumps virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ""

&amp;#x200B;

Also, masks reduce rate spread societal level, allow individuals avoid contracting covid. look meat processing plants. Everyone wears masks gloves even covid, still swept week two. Fine people wear them, 'bend curve' measure, 'squash curve' measure. don't. best video I've seen american, german, found good middle ground imo.

For example isolated infected people instead forcing retirement Homes (looking Cuomo) didn't. knew since February virus airborne masks needed. told overreacting wash hands airborne. Finally month later authorities begrudgingly gave us permission wear them. way death rate isn‚Äôt steep sars-Cov 2000s doesn‚Äôt make C-19 anywhere near comparable flu. think posts around lockdown measures states? Cause *directly* impacts those. Bruh post covid world, logic place here. get line daddy gubmint tells you, maybe youll get stimulus (carrot) check, good sheep maybe get unemployment start onlyfans lol California needs loosen restrictions, good grief. eat indoors outdoors am, go gym, go salon, libraries open, galleries museums open, theaters open. outdoor sports teams besides MLB considering allowing fans. Cases steady, deaths hospitalizations down. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing this. No, fucking spouse fucking positive, better get fucking tested least confirm fucking asymptotically spreading shit around. You‚Äôre right, average American won‚Äôt understand nuances. need simple rules, branded way identify with. 

The problem people ones think mask bad personally either makes look weak, makes look like democrat, inhibits health. CFO work said doesn‚Äôt wear ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad breathe carbon monoxide.‚Äù indirect effects people factor millions Americans think. safe friends? also taking seriously fine. gets glossed lot, asymptomatic spread really incredibly small. one feeling immediately sick odds gonna fine gathering outdoors masks. terms facts though, everyone freaking University like 600 something cases, yet single one hospitalized yet alone died. That's fact I'm gonna ignore. Even need wear masks walking restaurant sit down. moronic. nothing help stop spread restaurant everyone eating talking without mask lol Yes, bound happen. great percentage humanity consists adult children incapable making long term sacrifice (I'm talking particular, I'm reflecting comment). That's nothing done climate change too. That, like pandmic, quickly turn ugly hard manage. Hope wife stays safe.  We're heading fall two months respiratory illnesses start massively spike. SARS-CoV-2 currently essentially endemic country. going disaster.

His point contain happens. There's part country left death reservoir large. Populated parts Northeast, Sunbelt, California already past peak, parts now. That‚Äôs irrelevant. Whether prolonged period asymptomatic spread not, research time abundantly clear masks help slow spread viral infection. might work extra well COVID, work well virus. still experts claiming didn‚Äôt work droplet/virus size sorts pseudoscience (including, hilariously, people would stupid understand wear masks would therefore somehow make regret anything said context time said it, correct.‚Äù

Nope. quote posted factually incorrect. told task force meetings serious problem lack PPEs masks health providers‚Äù

Ding ding ding. Within dishonest answer couldn‚Äôt help sneak actual answer: mask shortages, felt lying downplaying mask effectiveness would greater good. Yeah, makes morons. linked articles downthread messages help explain it. Billionaires overestimated value opinions. almost 100 percent compliance too. Even mandatory live, compliance so. way alleviate this? 

painkillers course not, never said that. need hospital workers, people run power plants, EMTs, police, etc. definition ""essential"" way broad. ""It's like three 9/11's smh""  anyone know many participants recruited many received second dose? Last heard (about month ago) 11,000. Data collection (for efficacy) starts second dose...so potentially would receiving early data first participants...although minority total sample size. Hey smart ass, here's research paper can't understand crap we're scientists. Steve Bannon henchmen, REAL scientists dispel it, ""patently false claims"" discussed? EASY, since fake. fuck Twitter know research paper fake? Steve Bannon funded it? saying,t people world, everything comes mouths, censored, incapable ever telling truths? Sounds like care censorship, fits idealogy. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

dont blame gov bodies. terms mask issue.

I ride train every day people confront masked properly Spanish.

 mention wonderful president added enough extra public transport trains buses always packed rush hour? maybe enough contact tracers handle load? numbers? hospitalization actually approaching capacity nonsensical panic raw case numbers? Good one. American mentality Redfield Senate hearing vaccine: ""When going generally available American think we're probably looking late second quarter/third quarter, chance death age 30 like 0.09% based US case data. it‚Äôs even lower think many cases don‚Äôt know didn‚Äôt result death.

Person 2: dare you! isnt flu all

Person 1: oh model use track spread make predictions?

Person 2: flu model herd immunity estimate 60 80% base communtiy spread influenza spreads He's saying post uncivil, he's saying wants uncivil well, making shit up. Here's something left out... know studies say gone lock two weeks earlier could saved x amount lives? Apply logic mask usage might saved many nurses doctors lives well halving amount people sick hospital.
There's false confidence sense mastery earlier mask usage policies belies large estimation powers organizations actually get control. extent anti mask proponents. one willing accept might control virus might actual threat lives well. Pretty much, yeah. government official lies knowingly overtly know they're lying know know, quite simply can't trust anything ever tell again. 

Same deal America, there's basically nothing Trump admin could point taken seriously us. Every institution's credibility torched moment touches it, I'm worried effect persist long he's gone.  like PS5. takes long time make many. make there's enough available release date. think businesses able set rules store/website? think individuals able homes, etc?

I think major social media firms declared part public square making first amendment rights applicable. what, exactly (like, methodology) would accept? possible, even theory, ever convince you?

No single methodology possibly complete task suggesting. massive undertaking requiring multidisciplinary approach. Call ""lockdown commission"" comprised epidemiologists, statisticians, social scientists, economists, historians, etc, tasked determining costs benefits pursuing lockdown strategy sars cov 2 vs herd immunity strategy. let's assembled coalition non-political non-profits, congressional commission tasked showering government praise. Obviously report can't possibly completed time impact current dilemma, time return accountability government. think impactful set policy measures ever enacted good place start. Good thing keep talking nothing, though. Congratulations. understand keep saying there's PROOF claim. wrote research paper peer reviews public. probably read Wow, decided misinterpretation rules. Um....OK. Political discussion allowed sub btw. 

MLB postponed games due positive tests teams able resume play safety protocols met.

Yes money factor certain extent concerning TV deal, looks like aren‚Äôt going allow fans attend games. conferences still going eat terms gate revenue want make sure fans safe.

I think voted play players like playing football fans like watching TV. Maybe work maybe won‚Äôt it‚Äôs better trying all. Maybe live older people already sick something? I‚Äôm taking risks.  It‚Äôs article. CEO James Li says test demonstrates nearly 90% sensitivity ‚Äî often test generates correct positive result ‚Äî compared PCR tests, nearly 100% specificity, often produces correct negative result.

Bill gates true messiah, gave us affordable technology, gave us xbox, wants nothing use wealth help people world Yep that's said, welded starved. Way hyperbolic. I'm saying humans live longer without food people realize. Would suck? Yes. Would severely reduce COVID cases?

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Spain got control one time expect again, expect (per-capita) deaths go bit, come again. US? We're going go whole way.

Slow steady wins race! Trump pushed policies enable this?

Trump lock downs.

Lock downs killed small businesses significantly increased Amazon large buisnesses. Dude people saying something fishy going Wuhan /r/HongKong back late October/early December. placebo controlled study showed 70% reduction hospitalization amongst good drug, derived antibodies recovered patients. It‚Äôs conspiracy consider whether virus accidentally escaped lab. Burt Macklin ayyy Dude, chill. I'm agreeing reason taking personally.

I addressing analogy presented show differs scope complexity situation. r/OffTopic coincidence crazy date that?

Nobody absolute YET, eventually know one way other, why...

IF region ‚Äúmanipulated‚Äù Humans. 
We expect faster genetic Evolution virus towards 
less pathogenic strains lacking HUMAN-MADE region.

This happen one way other, know eventually. thing ""superior language use"". Get woke, fool. mind paying gets us better working vaccine. That‚Äôs fantastic. Yeah I‚Äôve going Bellevue rather CityMD reason. don‚Äôt voted even Fauci said first vaccines likely going terribly effective. better nothing. near MMR level effectiveness. 

We get better vaccines, take time. 

Maybe narrative finally shifting toward *self-protective* masks. boon would be... US made, authentic N95 masks like Lowe‚Äôs. Dare dream. own. people naturally introverts. people health problems. knock someone lives fit consider ideal acceptable. 

And ""foisting upon others"". merely said people wear masks distance another year without imploding. can. 

You still live life take precautions. wear mask public, avoid mass gatherings, give people space public. Sheesh. people act like between. Either hide basement 24/7 go massive house parties packed events. apparently two options people seem present with, unable work healthy medium. expect modern America, allowed choose two cartoonish extremes. Bill lookin like Mr. Rogers Funny bc lot Maga scum vets family vets you‚Äôd think tolerance uncomfortable would little higher, training discipline serving. However somehow people actual biggest pussies I‚Äôve ever heard of, exaggeration hyperboles they‚Äôre still businesses end day. you‚Äôre type person believes businesses going looking well-being consumer prioritizing profit revenue, you‚Äôre either really naive plain stupid.

Colleges hand advertise institutions higher learning 2020 they‚Äôre nothing business people run colleges. care much profits margins rather knowledge students amass. look much presidents colleges make you‚Äôll answer. I‚Äôm gonna go around goggles see soldiers wear dessert Oh boy fed gruesome propaganda. Chill, Modi nothing like describing actually pretty chill. That‚Äôs due reopening, climate.

Compare incidence respiratory diseases various states. peak winter. There‚Äôs weeks difference timing. Fingers crossed fires hold S.California, guess Cowering fear (until vaccine properly distributed) good choice Please inform colleague he's welcome go fuck sideways chainsaw.

Love, Italian Stop deifying career bureaucrat. That's correct, good catch. That's true, will. 2016. everyone mindless partisan, know. Whose projections? Nope. I'm giving two years this. never depressed. I'm even extroverted miss social interaction. asked much almost nothing return help us it.

I'm done Winter. really someone look attitude problem. Js. also provide students masks sewn spare time. Thanks United States! Honestly physician medical office, contact see possible get list high-risk people something announcement breaks vaccine going start distribution day X. would good bet probably, doctor refer high risk. well reasoned. think Americans ever fully locked down. Even ordered to, I've seen many giving fuck others' health. feel like it‚Äôs watching people punch nuts. Entertaining probably reason think is. keep seeing something K shape. idk means assume means rich get richer poor get poorer already terms society moving on. love seeing comments like people Ohio. shut borders. even travel regions (more less equivalent states). still remember one first ones wearing mask public. people thought crazy, (mid-March) straight acted like plague. We're Los Angeles.

Wish never happened. *am* glad wearing mask normalized hygienic. weird Sweden news sub daily couple months, numbers going almost zero... nothing. Specifically chose undergrad quality academics offered also probably equally social experiences. Football school lot spirit, small college town, whole deal. 

Got great degrees made ton fun ton memories. done grad school career promise education got today, things think back friends, clubs, campus, games, crazy life moments happen college haven‚Äôt gotten since. would gotten online school commuter school. 

Just view college purely academic pursuit doesn‚Äôt mean everyone does. Iowa here. pretty normal minus places choosing stay closed. mask mandate. store require one...but since enforcement basically request. agree vulnerable need ones isolating. Everyone simply sitting back almost two years. people like care technically correct. Sure worst going exact numbers. change abysmal response was. rather point fingers less developed countries worse US realize US worst capable of. 

I mean we're literally thread US passed 200k deaths. India less deaths 3x population well much poverty. US category *India*. Yeah US worst lmao.  People job still fucking dumb. fourth month back customer service rep insurance agent. There's 7 us working together (including me). I'm front, far enough everybody else, think anybody understands properly wear mask, except agent himself. One older woman simply wear mask desk. does, loosely placed front mouth. Another woman that's little closer always nose poking mask. even approaches people walk nose out. get we're spaced some, still small office.

What I've combat idiocy propping front door open fresh air. There's windows opened that's option. Every morning come disinfect desk area. think there's even regular cleaner office, everything grimy. Wipe something paper towel sure enough gray/brown. Sometimes complain look weird, I'm past caring. chilly yesterday morning complaining door asking would winter. First all, I'm gonna winter! I'm honestly trying peace next month want stick around test luck. plus side, maybe make expression finally die. Shit. used 2010 column census data ""scenario 1"" column cdc page.  tried mobile. I'll correct entry. Thanks. Conspiracy theorists would blown up. Bill Gates another george Soros them.

Bill gates, 5g, believe in? say vaccine sure ready next winter. Would wait spring/summer ? exactly doctor SIL stated. would answer Spanish? board English board. want everyone able read responses inclusive. honors degree Spanish. Castellano definitely superior yours. learned proper Castellano dialect teach universities. Obviously know Spanish would known Ud tu accent marks? 

And sorry mobile also sure accent marks. clearly understand wrote though. grammatically accurate though. Oh personally funded it? personal bank account? choose better words. People like America laughing stock. makes happy left US live New Zealand. Thanks willingness stay home couple months live normal lives. go pubs/restaurants multiple times week I'm headed big conference next week, road trip holiday. That's benefit taking virus seriously eliminating it. price life Australia? Super spreading virus everywhere land jail!!! sure supply hoarding legitimate concerns... even bother considering solutions instead ""don't wear mask""? mean Taiwan rationing masks, person gets x number masks every week could ramp mask production. IDiots (my word intelligent design proponents) focus pathways aren‚Äôt well understood complex argue irreducible complexity thing.

The evolution every complex cellular system isn‚Äôt well known all. Yeah dude sound fucking crazy. Go spend time lessons kids need posting crazy ass conspiracy theories reddit. incredibly small percentage people virus need hospital treatment. Relax. think answer pretending like everything normal Kemp continue ignore crisis. hear that? We‚Äôre midst strict stage 4 lockdown Melbourne. still get takeaway long it‚Äôs within 5km home. doubt they‚Äôre booming trade given many us don‚Äôt want people preparing food.

Here Melbourne way slow enact strict lockdown. numbers shot we‚Äôre really suffering. 50 total cases month two ago enacted strict lockdown then. it‚Äôs come heaps fortunately we‚Äôre sub-1000 40-50ish new cases per day. Yea, same. I'm CA mask compliance month lucky 50% places. I've heard anecdotal accounts traveling Nevada Utah friends say social-distsnce &amp; mask compliance seems higher states. Anecdotal, yes. I've also read flout mask &amp; social-distsnce mandates rate higher narcissism/antisocial/psychopathy spectrums well, CA rumored house Narcissus time two. Hand sanitizer. It‚Äôs available everywhere now. Let‚Äôs really really honest. anybody surprised?

An actual ‚Äònews‚Äô headline would 86% teachers PPE provided assuming 0.1% false negative rate, math works 100k people infected. Much lower cost cowering fear. Pretty unconvincing piece. first two highlighted problems reliance states making policy decisions themselves. author tackle issue federal government forcing policy decisions states would face Constitutional legal issues. also address fact one size fits policy would absurd 50 states.

The second problem per author opening early. argument may convincing month two ago anyone paying attention happening Europe right likely unconvinced assertion. makes editorialized. I'd prefer straight facts rather headline trying convince feel. imagine saved brain damage covid ""apples oranges"" - quite appropriate terms comparing NY(C) Netherlands Interesting Sunbelt showed similar pattern summer Northeast late spring, albeit spread less mortality. pray god know get it. wants herd immunity well join herd still need keep social distancing. instantly immune people coming frequently, likely months. would burden hospitals themselves, though I'm sure used centers.

Not mention, want make sure storage supplies adequate particular vaccine. example, Pfizer Moderna, want lot freezer capacity nearby.  read articles linked? ‚ÄúWe‚Äù not, don‚Äôt clump idiots. majority ‚ÄúKaren‚Äôs‚Äù you-know-who supporters though. listen SCIENCE accept LOCKDOWNS prevent exponential VIRUS!!!! cringy. Good newscaster leaning letting hook uncomfortable. thought second going change mind (the lady interviewed) know right! happened place? used bunch panicky loons yelling nobody common sense getting updooted? Chef's kiss indeed. Thanks wishes. wrote apparently ""too political"" energy try figure exactly crossed invisible line sand. white people don‚Äôt need wear mask you‚Äôre alone. keep one pocket case come across groups well interpreted comment exaggerating ""eliminated"". would say control measures taken. Im trusting chinas numbers either, point, think realistically, china best position control spread Except many studies SARS era laypersons wearing masks, even home around infected people. demonstrated effectiveness stopping spread cold/flu style illnesses fairly thoroughly. can't rely health authorities grok situation communicate clearly public way public understands early stages pandemic, **we really can't trust pandemic all.** Craaaazy! people think escaped lab think modified ""gain function"" experiment, weapon. know experiments bat coronaviruses done since results published. question addressed whether would genetic clues differentiate engineered viruses evolved ones. Sweet rant. nothing fact comment replying factually wrong know NOTHING long term effect virus!!!! saying April 2021 long time.

About three weeks ago changed mind August/September 2021.

Looks like news reinforced thoughts. without using masks social distancing? I'm done friends family poison.

I'm getting Winter, going back real relationships hang house play video games smoke pot. I'm afraid everyone stuff.

In public work, fine, precautions continue wearing masks distancing. Two years social isolation speaking behind piece cloth way live I'm it. Im poor paywalled  college 2300 cases plans remain open. forced go campus labs exams. tired people saying students choice. us need graduate without delaying longer. eli5 important? Nope, nope. Literally looking right seeing none bullshit. Literally every article I'm reading says free (mostly) insurance, without need pay $41 quadrivalent flu shot. statement still holds true. I'd say somewhat. state definitely trends toward natural/farm fresh/local trends. lot less fast food. Plus outdoor activities big. That's tragic perspective order.

14 children aged 1-4 died COVID-19 since 2/1/2020 2,083 died causes time period. people still considerate others Americans without legally forced. overall death per capita similar European countries awful. socialize Wyoming anymore? Like 7 people reinfected, that, millions cases claim one immune couple months?? Lol. goes beyond exception rule. absolute shit logic. Yes infection curve overall pretty similar. Pretty convinced I‚Äôm going go back normal everyone risk healthcare workers teachers get vaccinated, like doubt wait late next year I‚Äôm literally missing fun part life &amp;#x200B;

you'd need approximately FIFTY FOUR MILLION ***MORE*** covid infections 

to match Yeah, good article but...cmon

Edit: said, click ""other discussions"" tab, seem like discussed much reddit? would really surprised many people take corporate culture extremely seriously. never did. people do.

LOL India ""democracy"" told MRNA vaccine never successfully made hear several vaccines production... may right points people want go lockdowns/masks make COVID binary, however kids expect herd immunity DNA health get first year subsequent years. side science, children slowly get vaccines help chances. leg collective 'we' time. 
 
You correct roll dice multiple times day life, though current situation stressful many reasons. situations like driving car assurances maintaining car driving defensively help avoid disaster *in cases*. Risk tolerance extremely personal, even adverse effects others, COVID different. different car can't catch 'brake master cylinder bug', low chance catch lung cancer passing smoker. 
 
There compelling evidence near person COVID get it. compelling evidence many people survive COVID, complications withstanding. mean throwing caution wind preventable measures could taken lessen impact life. also mean complete shut-in. 
 
IMO closure rate surprising. Many businesses moved slow adapt either false assumptions, financially (like trying re-class bar restaurant beer tap). live people still going troves store/bars good luck finding space trail anywhere. seen statistic action live. That's another debate discussed here. two orders magnitude. accurate... positive result means practically nothing. Seems like mean total deaths per capita, deaths % cases. understanding death rate US (ie IFR) low standard Italy developed countries. 

Stats like total deaths per capita won‚Äôt relevant years it‚Äôs said done evaluate countries ultimately handled it. Remember viable hypotheses suggest countries slower spread ‚Äúflattening curve,‚Äù i.e. pushing today‚Äôs deaths tomorrow. Unless vaccine comes soon, we‚Äôre likely track end place, countries getting quicker others.  arrested violation orders violate people's right peacefully assemble. Australian government may recognize right, American government does, innate right people have, whether government recognizes it.

Since agree ~~3-4~~ 12+ week lockdown possible America, think actually done? standing around talking *should* anything. That's good, probably still people like this, hopefully less frequent. yeah, America. try talking logic them, seek compassion. culture steeped individualism like ours, everyone cares family one else's. 

As American, I'll probably take page book move soon place. Fuck 'em. don‚Äôt think living world. So, I've gone someone outraged US response someone frankly numb it. shit, going stay shit leadership changes. 

Maybe happens 2 months. Maybe 4 years away. Either way, leadership changes... article could weekly event. Thank yes wish everyone needs access stuff. ask high-risk persons self-isolate

guess what, people still anoying thing called 'job' üòÇ science ifs Yep. still fucked lives. curve got flattened turned wait vaccine. hospitals overwhelmed Houston places world didn‚Äôt end. can‚Äôt actually earnest question.

I‚Äôm sure workplaces actually family like mentality like family owned businesses family owned restaurants.

Australia outbreak locked city down, case numbers logically dropping. city outbreak reacted even faster zero cases day again

USA shit this. places managing containing it

Honestly, surprised 50 years comes administration Russian backed away point. else knowingly willingly cripples country 4 week lockdown work, what? Melbourne 12 weeks minimum. People arrested homes making Facebook posts. think go heavily armed country planet? Ok maybe different example. You‚Äôre cardiologist. patient referred office symptoms heart failure. echocardiogram indeed heart failure. also aortic stenosis looks chronic. aortic stenosis cause heart failure? contribute? incidental finding? It‚Äôs hard tell. point disease complex. I‚Äôm advocating exposing saying COVID isn‚Äôt dangerous. I‚Äôm saying counting number patients heart failure aortic stenosis saying ‚Äúthis number represents aortic stenosis-induced heart failure‚Äù assumes link that, present sometimes, isn‚Äôt present every time. Statistics doesn‚Äôt always translate pathology. clarified latest US coronavirus press conference. President clarified CDC director wrong. clear immediately sets numbers used, I've seen reported positivity rates high 14% assumes 100% excess deaths caused someone catching dying covid.

No lockdowns excess death toll own.

This exactly said makes sense. Question 1 : think probable
Question 2 : know. think shortcomings Western responses clearly shown pandemic resource-sparing approach costly long run. Also think much possible put two vaccine 1 vial many vaccines. mean rest comment prevalence statistics? Ya ok bud get back bunker. See 2022 you‚Äôre vaccinated. I‚Äôm sort person wishes workplaces would quit patriarchal ‚Äúwe family‚Äù stuff.

And colleges kinda same. Kurt Vonnegut called things Granfalloons. reviewed comments one said that. someone said mask 95% better.  bet schools upper class areas problem.

There's far leech *all* budget, simultaneously largest, nicest sponsored schools district.

This country rightly fucked. Eat help out, half price meals August dine in.

So encouraged people eat unhealthy food. also made sit restaurants get discount. hope...but I‚Äôm holding breath. Nice username. I'm sure 100% believe China's numbers too.

Out curiosity, many people murdered Chinese government Tiananmen Square 1989? customer chooses go eat, movie effort avoid exposure. know lots way. 3 4 week real lockdown conversation. Correct, deaths per day gradually declining. 

I believe means though compared countries, US still accumulating deaths incredible rate. 

Take UK example. UK currently 613 deaths per million entire pandemic, higher US 607 deaths per million. UK like 20 deaths per day since July, US currently sitting around 800. words, UK 67 million population adds 0.3 deaths per million every day. US, 330 million population, adding somewhere around 2.5 deaths per million every day. every 10 days goes by, UK would add 3 deaths per million US adds 25 deaths per million, we'd closing gap 22 every 10 days. even though they're higher us right now, easily pass month assuming nothing much changes.

Similar situation happening several countries currently us deaths per million, although them. semantically correct either. house, mortgage holder interest it. read somewhere mischaracterization, maybe due sinophobia, happened welded shut secondary exits apartment buildings, traffic could accounted certainty. 

I look much it, knows, sound like embellishment me, read that. point accurate. point scare people justify Pritzker giving emergency powers. lot healthy skepticism myself. least read article (unusual me) applying skepticism. NANCY PELOSI HAIRCUT

Compared millions would died suffering....pretty great. doubt I'll ever able convince anti-vaccer, wish nice day. said lot year Q3 starts July. I'm saying projection Q3 going optimistic take it, means lucky complete end Q3 -- is, Q4. Masks aren‚Äôt even 100% effective. still get virus wearing mask though it‚Äôs rare. new vaccine. don‚Äôt know it‚Äôll lessen severity, provide immunity, etc. want live live. restaurants still limited 25% capacity live example. underestimate power exponential growth.

That‚Äôs there‚Äôs much attention paid whether people producing antibodies response COVID-19. don‚Äôt think ever supposed long-term anywhere. again, Dr Fauci said don‚Äôt need lock-downs. also note number tests percent positive. post Illinois departments health's press release instead using news site provide full data issued release.

Did implement measures time? cities implemented masks well too? Otherwise anecdotal evidence. Netherlands never implemented masks except public transport performing exactly neighbouring countries. reddit huge obsession masks? Social distancing, ventilation physical distance people. Putting towel mouth small benefits. reason says ""for non-medical use"" blue mask boxes. 

In France wear masks inside better Netherlands Yes. False negative thing. happens politics economy trump science. dumb, even 'we care human rights' China knows lose political support economy goes shit people keep dying new contagious disease!


And even dumber government could bought N95 medical masks, public service announcement make masks. Japan Korea public campaigns DIY masks. Meanwhile like masks work, healthcare workers need them. dumbest many people bought blatant self-contradicting lie. Use brain even 5 seconds. 5 seconds. *seems* like reasonable statement, Redfield's credibility compromised hard know whether anything mouth real not. Yeah, NY try 68 people per square mile People say clearer stance federal government would helped, honestly think America fucked partisanship federal government (headed Trump) taken strong stance wrt things like masks social distancing, large section population media would go purely spite. Coronavirus denialism would strong (if stronger), would side.

My (admittedly, outsider) view US become country everyone reflexively opposite whatever side does, regardless what's right wrong.

If kind person believed ""5D chess"" stuff, I'd actually say Trump come genius plan: take virus seriously, result media (sans Fox) takes *very* seriously, demographics likely anti-Trump (who largely live urban areas virus spread faster) therefore take measures protect themselves. It'd terrible idea US follow suit. got way many uninsured people can't afford go hospital take time due sick. lots differences Sweden US would make bad idea. 
 
The US needs US-oriented solution. 
 
And assuming high death counts spring due executive failure strategy carried (as arguing now) side-effect strategy. Jobs starting grow again...

I know big cities struggling rural America large aren‚Äôt struggling didn‚Äôt panic Well, hinges testing. also can't get handle U.S.

But theoretically, stay lockdown tested positivity rate suitable proportion population zero (or whatever threshold medical professionals decide appropriate). even take long people take seriously stick it.  Spain hard, strict lockdown people sub want tho Wow... Even dumber imagined. Thank taking time explain it. anything? original post said Q3 hopefully Q4 starts. Q3 literally starts July. 

Even reason don‚Äôt get everyone vaccinated start July gotten quite bit population making situation much better. 

I don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre trying argue Yeah, biggest worry 50% effective vaccine approved rushed out, tick box politicians say oversaw release claim credit. we'll see people get vaccinated assume 100% immune unable infected infect others, become superspreaders.

If given 50% effective vaccine, change behave. couldn't. September 2020, still thinks US mentioned sentence rest? day. ‚ÄòBecause said so‚Äô didn‚Äôt placate child, doesn‚Äôt now.

Still floating cloud hubris? work government.... near natural reservoir

what natural reservoir? wet-market theory again? remarkable compared capable even years ago, still terribly slow. Even counting millions dead, whole planet lost year lives, basically 7+ billion people-years enjoyable life lost. Sure, part population is, sadly, living shit way even make much difference, global number meaningless. let's take ""the western world"", EU+USA, 770 million people, means every day stuck swamp existence, collectively loose 2 million people-years time. That's 30000 average lifetimes wasted per day.  good news lockdown lifted may 18th, interregional travel resumed june 3rd schengen travel allowed june 15th.

The increase mostly due tourism (ironically italians coming back EU tourists coming in). vacation season reflected cases stable since end August.

Now reopening schools happened 2 days ago. two weeks see precautions work.

Hope get control.  Harder hide piles corpses New Zealand wearing masks years longer something people going do.

Which need government compel (i.e. extend mask mandates, even increase penalties breaking necessary). 

Come on, let politics trump science. something we've trying *avoid*? Correct, Senate Democrats exercised filibuster, requiring 60 Senator vote stop it. Since Republicans 60 Senators, since single Democrats willing pass ""skinny"" aid package, unable come vote. Republican votes pass without Democrat filibuster, though. two weeks everybody! Remember type people vehemently protested business owner right serve gay people wanting wedding cake? Target business want mandate masks massive hypocrites support right run business see fit? ... What? got implying people feel fine think they've exposed going go get tested?

Lmao mutually exclusive see point  No, comments aren‚Äôt problem, problem general misunderstanding people lack scientific literacy frequent sub alter behavior allow sense urgency / safety impacted false notions kind salvation around corner it‚Äôs not. 2 12, Andorra San Marino, populations less 80 thousand. didn‚Äôt. took part comment misleading responded it. 

I understand overall point don‚Äôt disagree; however, made claim undeniably false attempt prove point. 

This thread literally people making misleading claims greater good, leads unintended consequences sort language scientists supposed use, experiment run validate refute thesis.

When use language indicates definite knowledge, indicates experiments finished, grant funding needed. ECDC cumulative cases per 100k last 14 days. check that. Dude, acting like never disease epidemic like United States lmfao even remotely true. ideas ""stupidity funny,"" ""stupidity innocuous,"" ""stupidity forgivable"" ended Donald Trump became President. 

Stupidity excuse detriment everyone else around you.

The stupid held accountable actions fully aware consequences. like stupid people need society nerfed accidentally run sharp corners, stupid minds nerfed rest us accidentally run bad ideas. goddam funny, lots brain power there, I'm sure Ivy league grads conspiracy. Fauci literally said people wear masks healthcare professionals. 

That's almost verbatim. rest administration didnt even think telling us make masks (a fairly obvious solution avoid hoarding) April. get immune months get again

You can't believe vaccine make better, really think immunity lasts couple months, means vaccine going last couple months. We‚Äôre point wear masks public, don‚Äôt gather indoors, wait vaccine. Knowing get smacked hard seasonal affective disorder every year, take large dose Vitamin D. Like 5 times suggested dosage. Caught COVID antibody tests prove it, experience extremely mild; got felt tired weak, went bed recovered mostly normal less two days.

Granted, I‚Äôm young, excellent health (according physical two months later, physically active. Even then, hear stories ultramathoners getting debilitated weeks basically bad hangover. wonder Vitamin difference, even part. recommend cloth masks then? guarantee higher U.S. since numbers longer accurately reported knows. China also likely there, story different place. Literally everywhere else earth save couple countries managed get control. China billion people controlled it. India another billion they're better us. 

It's always going happen. complete utter failure leadership reason got hit badly. Stop covering inept leadership. Yeah agree so... One main reasons going prestigious institutions like Ivy League schools friendships/connections make there. Otherwise, take classes online. like schools well extent. Fair enough. completely isolated. general it‚Äôs one safer conglomerations people. true. Amazon sneaky shit businesses sell them. Source: spouse worked business sold Amazon. Thank sharing experience! lol mean unthinkable depravity? 70% proven necessarily true several times, lots places already achieved degree herd immunity less 40%. like u seem disturbed  Yeah mean 180...
And Yes. no. Either way, every country would fcked fcked didn‚Äôt. escaping major consequences. Every country built differently leaders made different decisions different consequences. one really ‚Äúcopy‚Äù another country‚Äôs actions expect result. ideal world, yes.... pays?

Making wonderful statements ""responsible behaviors"" relying good nature citizens great countries levels social cohesion, addressing issues in, say US, fly. can‚Äôt even bothered wear mask Walmart

And can‚Äôt possibly see government telling everyone weeks masks aren‚Äôt effective, later complete 180 policy, might effect people‚Äôs willingness wear masks trust they‚Äôre told? There‚Äôs reason takes years school training become doctor research scientist.  definitely sound miserable. Now, United States, absolutely reason whatsoever wear mask."" - Dr. Anthony Fauci, February 2020

I never forget this. People left lionize Fauci (I'm left-leaning too) participation early mask-hoarding gambit unforgivable. sentence worded poorly easily misunderstood. EDIT! Hyphens' main purpose glue words together. notify reader two elements sentence linked. Although rules customs governing hyphens, also situations writers must decide whether add clarity. bar hometown requires masks moving around sitting down. Thing is, social distancing stuff got fined. one thousands examples I'm sure. Haha people come store work act smug ask mask say don‚Äôt. store owner doesn‚Äôt want people without masks kick every single one it‚Äôs fun watching smirk turn anger.

I live Canada province masks ‚Äúmandatory suggestion‚Äù. Reddit's Tales Retail... 10 idiots did. Uh, plenty novel things home. boring hobbies interests develop? Somebody tell Joe Rogan. Except that's scientists work, 

There two types studies pertaining masks, test masks protection **person wears it** protection **nearby person wears it**.

In February almost every single study past scientific history masks regarding protection wearer. total **two** studies archives regarding protection nearby persons wearer inconclusive useful affect.

Scientists, especially governmental health level, tend make public statements without body evidence support it. public got first hand account opinions scientific fields change new supporting evidence presented reviewed. happens every field, time. also *most* scientists publicize strange results without evidence confirm them. 

The public patience basic understanding handle scientific process. case, global pandemic, necessary make things public change fly. 

Now thread alone first hand evidence everyone thinks lied to, really witnessed scientific process work. Meanwhile, coronavirus czar Ronni Gamzu Tuesday called schools least fifth grade closed Wednesday instead waiting start national lockdown high rate infection schools.

Basically America month,

Which really begs question wuhan schools outbreaks fatigued. Even want right thing.

It's almost like put hopes strategy clearly unsustainable unrealistic solution think thirty seconds. underestimated stupidity Americans. Took ya 12 days respond. That‚Äôs zero. one public educator another maybe focus teaching less bullshit conspiracy theories. sweeping plans live Mars. think plans equal chance success. Oh get wrong; find viewpoint absolutely pathetic emblematic wrong subreddit. ""Belgium virtually discrepancy COVID-19 reported mortality (confirmed possible cases) excess mortality. "" study look Germany think World Data numbers looking for. shall see. FDA set vaccine efficacy threshold 50%. likely less effective older overweight population.

At point, vaccine far silver bullet, 70% may wild overestimation. like pandemic data might useful tracking things. *they* want move goalposts

This article wearing masks keep people safe disease. evil cabal enemies conspiring keep enjoying life. kind thinking called ""paranoia"". Put mask quit grousing it. Realistically, fewer patients, fewer enough make difference healthcare workers exposure. Masks important part mix, USA basically everything wrong, impact would probably negligible, particularly early days. Minute physics interesting video tube. Take mask reduces chance getting infected 50% chance infecting one else 50%, sounds like pretty crappy mask me. 60% population said mask. R &lt;1 pandemic stopped tracks. Non-random interactions people without masks requires mask wearers better masks.

So, yep, ambiguity misinformation masks big mistake. subsequent compounding mistake making mask wearing political unconscionable. time, data home made masks even basic paper masks would effective are.

We need data prove basic logic. know viruses worse get large initial viral load. knew covid transmitted via droplets. knew cloth mask inhibits airflow. 

With basic facts knew cloth masks literally barrier would effective.

Did know exactly effective? No, we're absolutely retarded waiting piece data deciding masks right answer. Absolutely idiotic.  know amazes this: legit, bona fide ***GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY*** 

They conspired lie mislead public *increase* health risks. public would better people STFU ignored questions masks said we're still ""studying"" issue.

For first time Internet era, I've discovered governments free democracies make conspiracy. remember conspiracy deniers claiming conspiracies can't work need many people stay quiet. Everyone knew masks helped yet WHO, CDC, Fauci still pulled teh conspiracy. 
 

This proves they're wrong: conspiracies happen even lots people know truth. Why? diseases high mortality extremely fragile. fact due 2019 Sweden fragile people usual year.

2020 looking another weak flu year even COVID. killed social distancing measures. Calicivirus (Vinter vomiting disease) similar trend.

Influenza: 

Calicivirus (Vinter vomiting disease): Melbourne Australia, there's many idiots keep nose mask pull mask unless they're passing close someone. That's completely killing point mask.

Not speak idiots wear face shield instead mask. wish illegal.

All spite mandatory compliance heavy fines following. Yup. Thing is, state could great except get bunch selfish assholes choose warm climate retire. vote. mask mini vaccine least u get face full viral load contagious killer diseases around life time. think would thing.

Have never heard pneumonia influenza?

I'm sorry line comment shows absolutely horrible case tunnel vision COVID given you. even worth discussing stuff literally believe COVID deadly disease America. brands+ chinese manufacturing cut off, yes they;d trouble walmart.com would right amazon's going lose basic brands, brands lose marketshare. *So Fucking what*. enough common sense revise opinion, going forever blame someone else shit goes South take responsibility? Genetics probably plays large part. I'm Canadian-Chinese start wearing glasses 7, sure reading much then. immediate family least 3/4 extended family wear glasses, contacts, corrective method.

I usually overestimate use windows  You‚Äôre really trying pull gun/gang violence this, you?  We‚Äôre talking 250,000 deaths, gangs aren‚Äôt even tiniest blip radar. 

What bad take Sure, science guided White House's response COVID-19, election year politics. Sure thing, bud. nice day. able hug get close girls bar might big deal loaners reddit leave house groceries, majority youth it‚Äôs normal frustrating. Also, excess deaths number based expected averages. Covid fatalities could little higher, little lower number. [Sweden 4th lowest corruption world. Still higher Nordic countries. TLDR: Canada's worst province better 48 states, measured case per population. human stupidity never cease amaze me, could totally avoided :(

not say arrogantly anything. rip. University Michigan campus free COVID tests.

Now think minority, poor, health insurance...you can't even get test campus. grind out. ‚Äúthe flu worse.‚Äù

this argument turned ""if counted flu deaths way count COVID-19 deaths, flu would sound much worse"" something like that. implication, understand it, people call old death want ""COVID death"" case flu.

It feels like matter scientifically-backed data-driven conclusion reached, already half-dozen conspiracy rebuttals waiting wings. really frustrating. mask mandate social distancing guidelines too. going get point people without masks without distancing. can't expected live limited physical interaction another year half. üéâüéâüéâ forget ""world beating"" trace app. Instead asking Hong Kong copy app. USA!

On one hand traditional epidemiological definition airborne lone virus particles capable becoming airborne infectious encapsulated droplet like worst case scenario, unstoppable, still evidence case COVID.

The problem common language version airborne big grey area spectrum infectiousness really tell us much say airborne way. definition common cold flu also airborne. Lmao look polarizing mask usage now.

Poor you!

Sorry daddy raised weak, coward son. Mine didn't. Yes, concrete example this, Kansas, mandating masks county. Governor favor masks tried pass executive order entire state, county commission could vote override order. generally case rural areas state overrode order urban areas seeing cases override order, even enhanced strict. 

Two weeks mandate place, secretary KDHE presented graph seemed indicate first masked counties way non-masked counties, two weeks, rate new infections per 100,000 lower masked counties non-masked counties. fact, rate new infections per 100,000 non-masked counties stayed (decreasing slightly), rate masked counties went down.

First, need secure first responders medical staff, prepared deal virus best can, meaning masks etc. hand, enough masks need time produce know fact least 50% humanity selfish shits tell masks immediately buy out, even need them.

I read paper, want know part think supports shows show R dropping NYC prior lockdown, 3 around 1

Pre lockdown.

Edited reflect finished reading paper.  Even hardcore, pro-restrictions people don‚Äôt expect last literally forever, I‚Äôm sure mean

let put another way: mechanisms caused pandemic getting worse better? 

The destruction wilderness areas, extraction resources, destruction educational healthcare systems....are things getting better worse? can't even hike favorite mountains anymore without running dozens dozens mass/CT/NJ guys hiking fucking bluetooth speakers swearing like sailors around kids.

It's infuriating. would require China know collective response piss poor.

Even Americans shocked badly society responded. Nice one! could benefit form (any form) lockdown art ourselves. many people save malaria polio decade? saved lot fucking people preventable deaths. 

&amp;#x200B;

and lmao gotten blue screen death past decade boomer dont know use maintain pc. Who‚Äôs quote that? poor countries anyway. point- anybody makes decision go back campus participate team sports/athletics pretty much deserve whatever get. exemplary citizens respect personal responsibility.

With regards mask, yes. things...not much.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Litter, cheating tests 2 large examples personal responsibility nowhere near exemplary. China known worldwide cheating. cancel SAT results one point much cheated. two month lockdown California. Didn‚Äôt go anywhere. Bill, love all, total BS. 

We lied beginning, still routinely kept truth. 

I've lost much faith FDA, CDC, WHO, academia this. 

1. use positions trust engineer response want society, even means lying them. 
2. withhold data, refuse generate explain meaningful interpretations situation national local level. 
3. time emergency, they've moronically clung protocols rules make sense emergency. example, allowing inexpensive DIY rapid tests become available.
4. gone rogue. bowing Trumps idiocy remaining post, legitimizes rule. state local officials taken control. Gotten emergency funding. Done necessary protect people. state, done that. Pfizer haz said injection would cost public $20, $40 total lockdowns pods would properly first place proper testing follow lockdowns lifted.

Look difference NYC worst outbreak now.  Good luck absolutely. wonder we‚Äôll even offer kids Where's bald military guy trump saying mask needed. months later saying need mask up. Wow didn‚Äôt know Bill Gates elected public health official certainly risk factor masks. people touch way much Teachers essential workers schools open, kids theory chose stay home concerned.

Not ideal doubt 2 months later. socially distanced neighborhood festivals stellar idea. know part lure festivals like Coachella, Bonnaroo, SXSW, Glastonbury UK, etc. ability socialize close quarters. music half fun, launching skinny version big, multi-day events may may much mass appeal, especially given amount travel takes place them. Local festivals deal much risk they're lot feasible terms public health safety.

Like said, anything, would think music festivals next year, they'd virtual since idea type infrastructure, full operations resuming going forward there. still would look like lab-created virus, genetically. look like one. Always question yourself, would care? possibly needed ever existance, would try bring good bad world?

I see Bill bad person.
Yup, naive, remember people trusted reason intuition.  Vaccine different testing, mass produced, testing requires lab machines maintain break(which do, often think) supply vials, swabs reagents kinds little things difficult source. 

The machines also run 24/7 keep testing demands. takes time machine read sample give results. 

It different vaccines mass-produced mostly central location locations completely decentralized labs country source materials. 

They already producing vaccine whether works not. governments already paid vaccines. speak mass producing them. enough everyone US everyone UK right away going prioritize gets vaccine first. going health care workers elderly. 

Want know vaccines produced going rolled series. States responsible distributing vaccines going little messy put mildly. good news already systems place vaccine distribution flu vaccine every year. every year flu vaccine little bit different manufacture year distribute everyone US think 40% people get flu shot every year. need prescription.

Since already distribution channels think implementation going horrible shit show like testing debacle. get flu vaccine local pharmacy, like 10 pharmacies 5-mi radius could choose from. could even go Walmart get flu vaccine think. 

I think vaccines available would take months distribute them. everyone would take vaccine, we're lucky get 50% compliance. 

I agree testing situation garbage really completely different situation. hindsight 2020 ;-) Nordic countries except Sweden seeing increases now. Germany also seeing increasing cases. sure toilet plume spread disease circumstance?

I think anybody knows right now. ""novel"" virus. Anyway, hurt take reasonable precautions. Close lid flush, wash hands, good ventilation bathroom. sure people share bathroom with, wear mask. good sense.  true. Speaking, laughing, singing, produce aerosole droplets carry virus. agree CDC trustworthy right now, CDC.
""On 2¬†July, WHO's Chief Scientist reported average IFR estimate presented two-day expert forum 0.6%.""
And
""According the¬†University Oxford¬†Centre Evidence-Based Medicine¬†(CEBM), random antibody testing Germany suggested national IFR 0.37% (0.12% 0.87%).""
And
""On 1¬†May antibody testing New York City suggested IFR 0.86%.

Firm lower limits IFRs established number locations New York City Bergamo Italy since IFR cannot less population fatality rate. 10¬†July, in¬†New York City, population 8.4¬†million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed 4,619 probable) died COVID‚Äë19 (0.28% population).¬†In¬†Bergamo province, 0.57% population died.""
All quotes wikipedia ""coronavirus disease 2019"". Therefore, would estimate IFR 2 % instead 1 %? even widespread testing availability point? live get referral get test results take 7 days. 

Even mid 2021 seems optimistic point. Hell, bit people complying authoritarian. look comments whenever country enacts forced labor people wearing masks.  Hah good call thankfully never concert guy. dislike something ever felt spending money on. Yes definitely. 3M N95 masks,

before covid - $0.6/piece
after covid - $3/piece See dont understand all. 

Wearing mask effective mask all. people wear type mask, even cloth one, would cause less spread therefore protect healthcare workers. would treating less infected patients. 

Spreading misinformation lying people also caused pandemic potentially last longer severe, therefore putting healthcare workers risk longer period time. Thank reply. agree, family working it. know weight caused large corporations, isn‚Äôt strongest case decreasing meat/dairy consumption don‚Äôt know is... afraid people would selfish buy N95 respirators desperately needed hospitals‚Ä¶ created narrative masks worthless UNLESS you‚Äôre one sick.

The part understand logic N95 masks available public would purchased hardware stores. assume Cedars Sinai driving Ace Hardware buy supply N95 masks. Please reread comment react.

We're saying thing. we've entered new age? heck about? South Korea much better US island. problems nutty religious cults take may that. That's 12 months now, we've dealing (seriously) Covid-19 6 months. ""Reinfection deniers""? least admit anti-science point. might want consider r/conspiracy instead. job. always get right. want get sucked conspiracy theories. want government elected appointed officials job better, start trying re-gain trust public. this, they?

This. motto prepared take extraordinary effort, better need regret it. people tend laugh realize I'm right. I'm always right. expertise advising people.

The building worked generator power. prepared things like bringing enough sandwich supplies everyone department lunch, flashlight first aid kit. ended using everything except first aid kit. right prepared, come due air quality. government lied us it. asthma think may long term effects that. hesitate ask work home Covid started happening here.

I almost prepare Sandy. prepared many storms petered out. figured hurt top gas tank pick refills prescriptions. flood damage neighborhood, lost power week.

I matches (I gas stove top) flashlights, able heat leftovers ice cubes melted (a sign fridge keeping food cold enough). extra gave matches flashlights neighbors prepared. non-electric coffee filter able make morning coffee.

I particularly glad filled gas tank. able charge phone (have since bought power packs charge them) without worrying running gas. also able avoid gas stations initial gas shortage chaos. time needed gas again, they'd worked alternating odd/even system orderly.

But people means prepare. That's need government responsible responsive emergency situations like hurricanes, terrorist attacks, wildfires, tornadoes, pandemics, etc. Tam also told us wear masks whilst sex. I'll assume talking ass spreading around immediately quarantine, did. argument beginning.

I really believe came bat, whatever animal think now, believe animal wuhan laboratory researched. person cleaning cage properly follow safety protocol &amp; somehow got infected, went home, spread his/her family, BOOM. Covid worldwide crisis. 

Has anything come evidence case?
It seems least bit likely malicious intentional release completely natural spread human involvement, due fact know biolab wuhan &amp; China's previous track record SARS getting one labs. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* shown viruses level needed herd immunity based inherent transmission rate scientific estimates transmission rate virus. 

For instance, measles higher herd immunity threshold spreads easily. flu would lower threshold (well, one strain flu). virus would two. ""I like person said, therefore he's wrong."" due lockdown\* Yep Ive heard least hundred times past months even. dont wear mask properly, loose, sure. 8 year old taught wear mask properly. rocket science. makes people countries think ""oh, we're okay,"" worrying signs many European countries repeating US's summer mistakes going follow footsteps. Still laughing.
 
Keep searching google imaginary 'proof'.
 
Also, probably see get good deal red noses. must paying fortune. two weeks, 1 million COVID related deaths worldwide. likely bet 2022. think music festivals gonna happening industrialized world hit herd immunity mass vaccination, near end 2021.  think allowed visitors yet Another hint people actually read article purposes clinging doomsday early know long antibodies persist patients recovering COVID-19.  result, person infected second time, immune system may remember best fight it, leading ‚Äúimmune amnesia.‚Äù **unusual** phenomenon vastly reduces chances of¬†developing robust long-lived herd immunity natural infection. Account age 2 weeks. work tpusa? It‚Äôs quite literally impossible get infected walking someone outside unless sneeze directly face. So, telling one respected Infectious Disease doctors planet...*just didnt know* masks helped prevent spread infection? range studies cited paper 0-10%. article, however, looks actual markers concludes rarer previous studies suggested influenza. years infectious disease research... goddamn source. Darwinism evolving. Yeah, true. thinking many cases US cannot stop this. may need try get herd immunity. 

Even vaccine may save us. flu like flus mutate vaccine may work long. seasonal flu shot changes every year.  100% true debunked months good science. Fomite transmission (touching things) nearly non-existent SARS-CoV-2. Droplet transmission (coughs, sneezes) air inhaled major transmission risk masks provide source control (you spread germs far) destination control (you inhale fewer droplets someone else). Non-N95 masks fairly effective controlling aspects N95s significantly better protecting wearer even droplets. SARS-CoV-2 also spreads via small-droplet/aerosol transmission mode N95s significantly better protecting wearer non-N95 masks. 

If access N95 masks, wear them. They're better protecting equally good protecting everyone else. access N95 masks, god's sake least wear **something** guy points out, universal masking highly effective even lower quality masks. ppl died nursery homes across Europe. Sweden low flue virus death rate year compared countries  Care explain excerpts EcoR1 genome then? 100% certain lab created? think cop-out simply say ""part human condition"" too. logic anything prevent spread since ""that's life!""

We little prevent spread flu infringes people's lives ability think restrictions legitimate respect preventing covid?

Of course. Things like encouraging basic handwashing social distancing restricting large gatherings uncontroversial measures. think that's US fucked bad. told someone way back April big worry US...

We worst worlds here. People want government telling do... even government playing smart GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS.  

AND people dumb/uninformed fuck politicize everything. 

What get result? Chaos.  global pandemic. 

Some people/cities/states wear masks socially distance sanitize surfaces play safe... not. another Anti-vaxxer Again, CDC director‚Äôs comments striking comparison what¬†Trump¬†said ABC News town hall voters last night.

The president said coronavirus vaccine, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre within weeks getting it. know, could three weeks, four weeks, think it.‚Äù  excuse States rdealing surging cases deaths today?

Same explanation New York COVID ""under control"". New York high level seroprevalence states don't. virus ran vulnerable people infect. Cuomo reopen state stupid political reasons, did, second wave.  can‚Äôt believe doesn‚Äôt care üò≠üò≠üò≠ agree generally speaking. I‚Äôm mandate pro-vaccines, unfortunately faith FDA, CDC, Federal Gov shattered. plan getting vaccinated one released - wait hear trustworthy sources it‚Äôs safety. first vaccine understand resisting mandate for, based current leadership. No, generalization wrong. I'm academia professors getting emails students panicking they're afraid come campus want stay courses. one courses tested positive - they're worried potential catching classroom lot people. pedant, class something asymptomatic case causes myocarditis surely symptom? limit classification symptomatic/ asymptomatic cases based obvious signs i.e. fever, coughing, tirednesses, aches etc?

A person asymptomatic outward symptoms. words, realize sick, asymptomatic. People myocarditis may realize myocarditis. applying real world, think building fires. B cells effectively like fire marshals mandating things like fire doors etc mean event fire spread much restricted, may still require hefty repair bill recoverable.

I would put like B cell (more specifically antibody) disease like fire extinguisher put match. COVID cell response, like wait firetruck put fire that's spread. cases, fire put out. But, sometimes, lose entire building waiting fire department show up. regard ACE2 receptors, something kids adolescents naturally less receptors? typically experience severe cases less entry points virus. 

Maybe, children higher viral loads adults. indicates active infection cells likely higher rate seen adults. (Edit: say infection probably stay localized due immune response rather spread organs like see adults.) thing kind like infection poliovirus. got antibody strong cell response, symptoms. still infectious spread disease. But, asymptomatic. There's ""just"" though. That's significant proposition. I‚Äôd agree assertion lol, there‚Äôs lot neuropathy lung damage observed recovered patients even decade SARS1 still observe impaired lipid metabolism among recovered patients. saying vote president lie coronavirus needlessly kill hundreds thousands Americans? spin good way ‚Äú could 2million‚Äù

one death enough take serious inmediately, premier told people stress go travel March Break. walk back days later.

Masks became mandatory public transit sometime July. I'm fine giving 65+ crowd first. think changed profile picture tweet may reflect profile looked like first tweeted math wrong. get percentage, take number deaths, divide number cases, multiply 100. it‚Äôs actually 3%. still 2.5 million active cases country.  Bill earn epidemiologist degree from? That's confirmed cases; spring certain groups tested, everyone get tested.

The estimated number cases spring 4.2 times higher (272k vs 65k). Probably tons. even reduced flu cases stuff, southern hemisphere, flu season. go August 25, 2020.

That‚Äôs like warning forest fire house already burning down.

They‚Äôve recommending testing nursing homes since May finally decided support initiative funding looks like July. 

Was bad call governors that? Absolutely. bear full responsibility information May? Absolutely not. Especially Trump busy ‚Äútrying cause panic.‚Äù

See, admit mistakes made people side. That‚Äôs difference moral failing. 

I say moral failing I'm sure comes this. 

I think cop-out simply say ""part human condition"" too. logic anything prevent spread since ""that's life!"" 

Do think restrictions legitimate respect preventing covid? would want us go back development. importantly, none us panicked. Sweden example US us leftist, still hate ? Honestly, way gain function research.

I think agree this. basically infinite mutations could study, chances study ""right one""? Seems like risk far outweighs possible reward. course, means lot scientists find new lines research count met resistance. Oh, Fauci incompetent then? He's either liar he's incompetent. it? Fuck it. Canada take whole Northeast? Please? Assuming know New Zealand‚Äôs increasing cases, subsequent 2nd lockdown, tamping increase; would gone done anything indoors without mask New Zealand anyway? 

There‚Äôs something said amount deaths US said ok. That‚Äôs awful. don‚Äôt think, person, would behaved differently NZ. would still wear mask everywhere, still wash sanitize hands constantly, still indoors others long periods. 

Because there‚Äôs guarantee virus eliminated given country. would inconvenient lol. still mortgage pay. better situation most. pretty well plenty bank keep going. remember though everyone position in. couple missed paychecks destroy them. Funny worry shareholders care less people need paycheck survive. give crap government keep giving people money months end. going happen actually need money nobody say long. can't completely take care entire population next 20 years. People need want take care themselves. everyone mommy daddy taking care like do. amount privilege coming people like astounding. care less average person. really wondering aspect raising child could cause lack empathy person like you. idea made absolutely care people personally know? Even though know them, still care people going through. can't really explain it, me. Apparently *THe mEdia IT!1*

Still explanation gov't anything it, though. people say Fauci crooked *executed.* least arrested yet? 

Even fantasy world inconsistent. American yeah Americans contrarian. Remember laughed Chinese people wearing water bottles like space helmets? innocent time perhaps. Nl, still dont need masks
 working fine

this fearmongering terrible determine vaccines harmful children, then? test adults assume it'll behave children, terms safety? feel envy sad NZ. Since May highest new cases per day whole country 14. 14 cases daily peak, it‚Äôs gone since. I‚Äôd take ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù opposed situation US day. levels actually take focused efforts contain it. 

It‚Äôs worth noting NZ 5.12 deaths per million people due COVID. US around 600 dpm. difference staggering. Oh yeah? That's interesting, read bit. Honestly heard much Victoria Link paper: less impressed hoped be. Basically fit model use estimate impact lockdown facemasks. facemask confidence intervals huge, much outer bounds 95% actually increased virus.

Of particular interest R around 1 lockdown went effect end date paper, June 7. Locking enough. whole purpose temporary lockdown get new infections close 0 temporarily, ramping contact tracing, testing, PPE production East Asian standards. way, open again, quickly quash new smaller outbreaks like New Zealand, China, South Korea.

America wasted lockdown March-April. like approach. needing/wanting travel countries, gives false hope. Given current situation especially handled US, obvious border opened quite time.

I really think government announce border closed least Jan 1 unless certain conditions met. November rolls around, conditions likely met, close another 6 months. things improve, always option opening early. Lol... even exist outside touch propaganda literature? Clean brainwashing plz get right. hit school blocks us. good made N95?

Related Agreed. moment told masks weren‚Äôt effective confidence shaken immediate thought aren‚Äôt effective, reserving stockpile medical professionals? Don‚Äôt misunderstand me, agree 100% medical grade masks reserved working medical field highest risk, narrative reserve masks professionals let‚Äôs work figure works available general population - i.e. cloth masks wearing now. Ugh, could go on...it‚Äôs pathetic image society people leading (Trump part discussion confidence Nobel laureate combined intelligence potato) chose hedge truth large portion society selfish make decisions overall common good. truly sad thing is, decisions, made full information could best common good individual. Sigh... football canceled coronavirus topic, football resuming spite coronavirus isn't?

We've historically allowed posts spots resuming since potential vectors infection. Use search function look posts mlb, NBA, NFL, European soccer, college football(which already shared you), etc. We've consistent whole time. thing someone posting party rally hosted spite coronavirus. Yeah, pretty frustrating... Think police officers realizing he‚Äôs exposed continuing job professional manner Similar Nazis famously socialist awful lot men women children America various reasons, entitled government benefits. non American living legally despite spouse paying taxes 7 years, receive stimulus check entitled anything. friends used life savings emigrate (also legally) January also arent entitled anything cant claim unemployment either. I'm sure many situation. many undocumented people would left high dry? Probably millions. thats without issues trying keep country hundreds millions closed indefinitely visitors may bring virus. lot Americans seem think plan like one mention doable here. isn't.

Also, NZ economy end screwed anyway. need tourism. Im pretty sure would‚Äôve taken showed up. numbers aren‚Äôt high enough. Keep pumping science works? Take information time revise known grows? waited sure knew every detail 100% communicated rest us pandemic sure. Lockdowns though? Originally toted short term measure ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù countries (or Italy? don‚Äôt remember) overflowing hospitals.

Meanwhile 'murica, refuse learn lessons actively taught us every preventable death.  flu season essentially exist Southern hemisphere year. measures enough result decreased transmission SARS-CoV-2 (and based decreasing case incidence noticable lack exponential growth, that's likely), highly likely respiratory illnesses usually arrive winter also well-controlled.

I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll try go loopholes he‚Äôs officially gone. April study proving asymptomatic transmission, thought people symptoms could stay home. Then, learned would enough. Ergo, based evidence science, alter recommendation. 

How hard people comprehend this... That‚Äôs good know. mod bots popped times mentioning different colors states comments blocked mentioning name president.

Yikes, supposed make feel better? one, traffic accidents contagious. get accident next people meet also get accident.

This relevant topic hand though, saving lives. is, needs updated ""saving lives something contagious"", seems arbitrary. matters ultimate life lost, exact dynamics get there. death tragic comes contagious cause?

But since bring up, *really* seems distinction without much difference. go public catch virus, go public transmit virus. go roads get killed accident, go roads kill others. tons happen time. population already near death, driving far, far, far greater risk death. mention, shitty driving pretty Also, take precautions always updating rules infrastructure prevent traffic accidents. Localities always modifying intersection lights, signage etc avoid these.

Maybe things take even more. would complaints retiring 40's. would definitely dream. We'll see, hopefully things keep going way here.  Belgium count probable Covid deaths, confirmed Covid deaths. look excess mortality data fine, everyone else under-counting. ""Just best numbers."" flu

Didn't realize flu causes life long organ damage Google source lmfao. lost argument pal I'm sure that, tbf think sort overestimate now. studies I've seen havent' studied efficacy masks isolation. Often studies find people wear masks less likely infected people may careful general distancing etc. least judging number cases Greece vs enforcing 2-meters rule masks seem much less effective. understanding countries simply cannot afford go another lockdown settle measures like masks slow infection rate certain degree.

Social distancing gold standard. beginning, know many things disease, take risk result countries enforced strict lockdowns. Masks perceived ineffective sort are, true risk people would think masks make invincible disease break social distancing rules. know really pressure lockdown huge, masks alternative ""yolo"" Yeah mean world class research institutions located communities advanced medical infrastructure disposal basically third world slums. ignorance pretty funny. Obviously completely eradicated. would much much better spot competent leadership start. No, mean reddit ""sponsored"" comments. hard say. heard Covid [lingering clears respiratory tract. impossible carrier, hard know. new information. Please careful. good news. hope assumption abstract proves true state.  Among backlash focused him, question exactly said true?

Because lot appears proven true factually accurate. 

Even don‚Äôt care person reason, shouldn‚Äôt focus scientifically true true go there? count substantially higher death rates immediately attributes Covid-19 we'll find actually much higher. Four years! Four years! /s  Literally every country better corona Thanks man, appreciate it. Stories like always remind much privilege healthy. 

I wish best luck towards wife. hope kick cancer's ass. Basically information came non-peer reviewed paper.. heavily scrutinized. video linked says 3rd, behind Bolivia 1 can't recall. #3, not#1 per video.

Have great day! still lot levels ""open let run rampant"" right now. like that, COVID here

What? think three weeks lockdown would eradicated covid US? many European countries locked least one month disappear. course, helped lot together mask mandate, probably best approach and, said, also us could done it. ""no COVID here""? Improbable septic picture going result endothelial damage, includes influenza. sepsis quite literally one common causes disseminated intravascular coagulation. Whether virus capable directly infecting endothelium going relatively minor problem compared sepsis w/r/t ARDS coagulopathy.

You clearly *don't* understand medicine surrounding this. spreading misinformation, really sit one uneducated. google reddit ""education"" value. 200 thousand dead Americans definition great?  


Damn American culture deficient. Inferior. election year. politician advocates guaranteed lose. don‚Äôt know live, definitely ‚Äòopen‚Äô It‚Äôs thing mentioned tried doing. patients works patients hard hearing later stages dementia really hard time visits. Either can‚Äôt hear don‚Äôt understand family won‚Äôt come near them. Side note :

I thinking difference daycare children abd retirement homes elders 
Biggest difference elders usually come home Actually problem slow underreaction. would quicker recovery less damage we'd locked properly earlier ""Yeah, fake numbers. really die pneumonia.""

\~Same people think COVID-19 deaths ""fake news"" bullshit, fear mongering headline genetically engineered pretty shit.. engineer ebola already 30% mortality rate. 1) infuriating 6 months thing name brand N95 masks still cheaply widely available mass market retailers US. everyone seems forgotten this.

2) ludicrous notion early pandemic masks would ""give people false sense security"". never made sense begin since debunked w/ formal studies. US Blame society, China shame society.

China anything save face, avoid shame spreading covid around world. cares created china, spread contained properly china. somethin' smart! America going lockdown again. happen unless literally people dying streets. think anyone either side political spectrum willing push another lockdown. may well advocate re-instating draft they're going that.  Weird okayed right election. think doctor hong kong claimed, april, first hand evidence made PLA lab wuhan. worded like personally saw it. got debunked pretty easily since people hong kong allowed PLA, allowed lab first place. economy would fine, 200,000 people would alive. 

While agree comment general, actions would prevented every single Covid death US. Another breakthrough test could end pandemic never hear again! links main website. something specific?

EDIT: see it. Thanks! dont believe point 3 week lockdown ""make go away"" isolate identify cases information point ""make go away"".

 doesnt matter household isolated together 3 weeks (regardless 3 week shutdown, one person household gets it, everyone household probably getting it), matters individuals household pass along. lets open movie theaters bars /s one dismiss said data.

You're one wild claims. bring data. Obviously. definitely knew going two weeks constant shifting goal posts needs stop people going say fuck it, I'm going back normal weather want not.

I'm saying that's right thing that's start happening. American government disclosing downplaying severity Covid 2 months leader golfed also help. notthisthatortheother engage, delete **every single** comment makes next morning, every day. Well got 20 new cases today sooo currently estimates many Americans exposed coronavirus antibodies? ""Imagine"" using ""Imagine"" begin post 20 times thread. saw that! Im super impressed ontario goverment handled pandemic beginning. saved lives taking seriously immediately. ""virologist"" suspect linked Stephen Bannon. still opened early hitting goals, impossible stop travel states controlling spread. So, reinfection going happen every state start control virus.  case numbers keep rising literally ran test capacity.

But Jaap van Dissel keeps saying masks anything. suddenly corona sceptics conspiracy theorists belief government one thing fits Facebook telling them. no, separately, state path recovery, continuously fucking others. Nah. Well America. bad economic indicators. Lockdowns over, people still spending U.S. Thank skeptics, won. economy screwed 12-18 months. retail sales increased 0.6% last month, falling short consensus economist estimate 1%. reading marks slowdown July's 1.2% wore mask beginning. knew day one, would help. knew internet research, common sense studying little history, holy hell could Orange moron ""in charge"" able keep lying insisting people required wear made political issue.

How epically stupid people day still refuse wear mask. Yeah worlds scientists cover CCP. lush hills surrounding Bavarian universities steep rocky coast Southern Japan. even bought R. Horton Vince Racaniello. one brave scientist knows truth dares speaks out. /s chance visitation happen outdoors feet apart? feel like worth mentioning Jan 25th Chinese new year, huge time travel China. Trump ""shut down"" travel China Jan 31. week late 200k American lives short. lockdowns. can't honestly expect regular people middle active pandemic think, ""sure may get seriously ill maybe even make family seriously ill, need ignore live normal life sake economy."" 

This what's currently happening. saying customers choosing go safety. reality businesses either forcibly shut open guidelines push away customers. went business operating 100% customers simply chose go, even chose go due irrational fear mongering, would different story. that's what's people going apply cold logic accepting deaths, including deaths families, making personal decisions.

Plenty people every day. Every time parent gets car his/her child, accept risk family could die car accident. Parents send kids school accept kids could die transmittable illness (quick reminder children died pneumonia COVID since March). Life come guarantee safety. Fearing COVID healthy young person irrational. really feel need stay safe COVID, that's society's responsibility, yours. Buy N95 masks stay fuck home. expect others you. make sound like fault, animosity? #Winning That's like super low number compared many Americans actually are. Oh.. doesnt think windmills cause cancer, believes ‚Äúnoise‚Äù windmills causes cancer stood right beside windmill. noise hear blades swooshing air, pretty quiet unless right beside it. Even sounds like gusting wind. doesn‚Äôt make whatever fuck noise makes.

I drove part New York state fields fields windmills. like new...

What stupid stupid man go hiking? original paper explains ""most transparent explanation"" unlikely. Here's tl;dr since read it:

SARS-CoV-2 looks like bat virus picked piece targets human hACE2 receptor human coronavirus. happen, host infected viruses.

It could happen humans ZC45/ZXC21-like bat coronavirus would able infect humans.

It could happen bats ACE2 proteins bats different human hACE2 therefore adaption would able yield RBM sequence seen SARS-CoV-2.

And could happen species like pangolin none animal ACE2 proteins exhibit favorable binding potential SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein hACE2. Where‚Äôs ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu‚Äù people? 

200k dead one held responsible?

But hey USA #1... pointless mask go well pointless douchebag? Covid hit - elective surgeries hospital stopped. hours reduced much actually able get partial unemployment benefits.  15,000 lot. sucks. I'm hoping we're get fall weather people gather outside instead inside restaurants. &lt;5% world's population deaths. Clearly, ignoring thing living life like normal going work.

As long covid threat, people going go shopping like used economy going recover. way contain virus, start repairing economy. Comparing death tolls, I‚Äôm really doubtful equal severity, even vaccine produced distributed worldwide. flu rarely sole cause death. isn‚Äôt true COVID-19. seen kill many otherwise healthy individuals ages.

Source: [this disturbing graph made comparing verified death counts two Well got 20 new cases today... gonna lie Trump gonna get hit balls TV would probably watch. check football budgets Big 10 Power 5 schools. Remember Trump said would gone days? Anyone one brain cell could see pandemic go away 2 weeks lockdown. absurd. India way. Five weeks counties numbers steadily rising. Clickbait  EU? believe great risk, you. real question is, willing take risk going US? already knew thanks corona finally see clearly governments kill people blindly, made mandatory shut longer lot father, mother, brother friend would still alive pretty normal. sure even worth news story. effing thing work, that's thing. hanging onto idea people die.

Yep, friend mine big this. We've mutual friends, family friends, test positive survived - hospitalizations yet. seems like every time another person gets it, die, he's digs even ""this overblown people power wanting control."" literally admitted lie said it. Honestly, get it. couldn‚Äôt get toilet paper entire month proof people hoarding resources there. 

Doctors nurses healthcare workers get masks first. Period. 

Our national preparation entirely different story whole separate shitshow discussion. know, really depends are. realize. US really big place. really depends are. live NC things actually really good area. open things almost seem normal here. Business booming! never making money now. really freaking nice. investments great also probably everyone. job market great. Everyone around awesome. bought 2nd house housing market crazy. hard even find house definitely sellers market. People buying houses like crazy here. heard car sells great too. got new truck told there. son back school things good too. private school though know better situation.

But take California example. know California alone responsible half unemployment entire country? Think that. also means things even better rest country. Throw New York also. awful. means things better everywhere else, like live. Things actually really good can't complain anything. Thank god live one super liberal places mentioned. think would good lived there? highly doubt it. remember. lot people actually really happy right now. perfect example. lot people like site really naive comes real world. know kid really understand things work yet really careful getting information reddit.

How many comments post? Maybe something like 4,000 lol? 330,000,000 people US. Think small sample size getting here. tiny! see kids like getting easily manipulated places like kind sad watch. get older realize this. way even get close idea people living right site. makes seem sheltered well traveled. promise come around though. understand everyone hiding corner house crying situation. people thing best can. tons peolle like actually great right now. want make look young naive like doing. I'm sure would love position now. see people around thing.

I'd watch movie. know you, I've grown tired winning. Don‚Äôt start turf war now, guys.

It's ""turf war"" refuting statement also believe false?  never enough begin with. simple mask never component even basic first aid kits alongside bandages cotton swabs beyond me. father flat says doesn‚Äôt care people die.  yap.

I've going outdoor restaurants local bar practices social distancing months. 

I've taken vacation girlfriend Louisville, stayed historic hotel, tasted bourbons, browsed pretty cool bookstore, took sights.

I took another vacation stayed cabin woods, light pollution, stargazing point. went kayaking.

We quaranteam people mutually, exclusively hang group. Game nights cookouts on, months. 

What ""robbing people lives""? completely insane. asked wear mask, stay feet apart, certain mass gatherings like concerts hold. robs entire life, I'm sure that's anyone else you.  Lying virus? hope avoid includes 'blinded' side effects data i.e. participants, placebo not. philosophy is, going whatever fuck want, regardless affects people, YOLO? think good level morality? everybody act way? Technology job killer, lack manufacturing.  suspect outbreak going accelerate automation investment since robots pandemics stop production.   Well mallard pandemics :( compared US?   it‚Äôs matter society government them.

According recent history, society government stack refrigerated trucks room morgue. Fauci also said one point masks general population detrimental, difficult trust him. saying that...

WhEn CoMEs MiCrOChIp YoU! Bargaining. Coronavirus liked article Well France 10,000 new cases Sept. 10. proper testing protocol players/coaches cautious public, sports without fans completely practical. Sadly, yes. [Look [here‚Äôs take still doesn‚Äôt make villain story. Folks gotta understand isn‚Äôt black-and-white, mistakes, matters follow up. Fauci lied, also lot good. It‚Äôs complicated. (‚Ä¶)  think western style health care ""evidence based"" meaning recommend anything unless trial journal. opposed using bayesian statistical reasoning, basically common sense. Actually death count thought lower officially reported. much, hundred. Korea It'll easier winter... *for us northern states*. I'm expecting southern states seeing influx snowbirds escaping winter and/or shelter place orders. large companies majority government owned run. certain elements capitalism economy agreed socialists economy socialist.

I used think read subject changed mind. *cries one million*  May. peak June delhi approx 100000 cases daily e. catching 4000 40% positivity rate. 1 25 cases caught.
Now approx 15000 cases daily catching 4000 it. Approx 1 4 now.

Ahmedabad catching near cases now. ""As President I'm going make America WIN. arr going win EVERYTHING. going win MUCH going get tired winning. going ask stop winning much. I'm going say 'No' continue win.""

Well, guess we're winning SOMETHING. guys we‚Äôre number one!!!! Wooo  *checks European infection rates* uhhhhhhh.....you might want use argument anymore man foresight too, lacked leadership Sadly opioid ODs days fentanyl related. People can't even get reliable H anymore. relative availability fentanyl precursors minimal quantities required make large amounts narcotics (compared opium latex, contains morphine/codeine/thebaine; precursors oxycodone heroin) compounded current ""opioid epidemic"" U.S. faces exponentially. 

If epidemic led increased organic semi-synthetic opiate/ consumption would left many lives intact. Without rate limiting factor opium latex, barrage fentanyl (and potent synthetic analogues) onto mainstream public catastrophic. still feel frustrated it. unnecessary. reason shortage PPE preparation mess. 

If Tam told people put something, anything, fucking faces, would fewer people getting infected. could good protecting healthcare workers?  

Another thing pissed Trudeau saying ""nah need test, symptoms, isolate"" he's leader fucking country close contact spouse tested positive. Giving impression need test sick good look. 

Canada badly, seems rather fluke point. general thought intentional accidental.

Again, completely missing point. 6% link nothing current topic. course masks social distancing help....these common sense now. None changes horrible decisions New York made prior killed tens sending infected elderly back nursing homes. Stay topic can. doctor claim originated **explicitly** stated think hospitals committing financial interview FactCheck.org, however, Jensen said think hospitals intentionally misclassifying cases financial I‚Äôm trolling. diabetes lead early deaths? Healthy people likely survive covid. Stop letting fear mongering make think everyone gets dies. Gates fix blue screen death lectures country health stability. first last... RB not? definition lockdown? 

It‚Äôs easy say lockdowns successful narrow scope countries one successful (although second waves put doubt too). reality countries lockdowns failures completely outweighed economic devastation caused. Fauci tried play politics recommendations beginning. world-renown doctor scientist people took recommendations seriously. elderly next door neighbors said masks really effective pointed Fauci's comments early admits ruse. since passed away Covid. truly believe Fauci blood hands. doctor, politician Dr. Fauci. Shame you. top? people actually read articles. Covid-19  products, instead manufacturing food restaurants

Service economies far stable reliable manufacturing based economies.

We simply cannot compete areas world manufacturing. China effectively monopoly it.

A good example would Britain. England used goods based economy. sold steel things. However, world globalised competition became fierce, mining became unsustainable go (hence, Thatcher.)

You hate Thatcher much want horrible things did, economic policies made UK survive economy intact now. know, waste breath heartless prick like you.  mean like China? we're currently averaging 1000 deaths per day. ""first wave"" highest daily average saw 1200 August.

To reach another 800k deaths year, deaths would need climb April levels stay whole year. honestly think that's gonna happen? fact summoned bot ""prove"" OP wrong suggests practically want happen. Herd mentality! 100% true. I‚Äôm technically essential working home fianc√© goes office night. I‚Äôm sometimes jealous gets leave house us strapped extremely thin childcare break entire day.

There's also /r/CoronavirusUK, might also broad. ü§î reddit? Hahaha, watch YT videos across country cars, sneakers, real estate, hobby items noticed country moved fearing COVID. Yessss! Go Green! every mistake global conspiracy. Grow fuck up. People get things wrong sometimes. think that's social media took discourse usual turns religious shit. lot valid points discuss question good masks need seep society everyone read scientific research, simply can't people form mobs anyone dares hint something feel comfortable suddenly become poisonous belief-driven religious/political issue par building wall.

In order learn risk asking saying stupid stuff immediately shit they'll likely nope out, join mob matching bias, and/or become frustrated point becoming either toxic troll. 

In Sweden flipped way around, people often referred version far right ones trying push masks level eventually toned political challenge question politically independent officials managing policies kept ignoring politics. 

Sorry, turned bit rant. I'm immune means \^\^ Apologies overlooked something comparing professional soccer players Europe collegiate unpaid football players America?

Even ignore differences cases / infections America Europe, talking unpaid athletes whose institutions stakeholders (conferences, merchandising, tv networks) profiting athletes assuming COVID risk vs Euro soccer players receiving compensation risk playing. .05%, point?

58k died Vietnam nationwide protests. 

3000 died 9/11 annual memorial. 

4 died Benghazi days worth hearings determine fault. 

200,000 die President admitting mouth downplayed risks - continues - people ‚Äúho hum, go back Applebee‚Äôs now?‚Äù worry China save world! Malware cyber virus else uniquely happened year could source 350,000 deaths?

Locking people inside 2 3 months, massive unemployment, cancellation tons medical procedures make way surge coronavirus hospitalizations never came, reduced cancer disease sceeenings name few. president knew February! led us wrong. Yep, approach always go for.

People dying SOMETHING. COVID, what? masks lied either. lied long would need social distance/lockdown.

Two weeks, Two Months, till July, till end year. saying Spring. What's next 2022? Spring 2022?

Just tell straight next however long. think that's answer. city, Austin, fairly open right now, everyone's wearing masks, hospitalizations lowest point since May-ish. count deaths even probably unrelated still chance covid infection.

Compare Netherlands seems count different. 

Just look excess mortality vs covid death count belgium compared Netherlands. That's North Dakota, South Dakota. economy fine moment.   \^ this. Smart people knew scientifically tackle this. enough smart people. Sadly, feel like number needs millions people take seriously US. hopefully enough people affected people say know somebody that's died it. maybe not.... stock market high! Sorry yes right, west coast.

I adult entire time Obama power really hopeful could make world better place. Instead turned sellout Wall Street dropped bombs started wars.

Let guess want blame GOP controller Senat actually anything? Neo-Liberal ran progressive platform kicked grassroots movement curb moment got power.

And getting noble price biggest jokes. dropped bombs Bush ever did. Started new conflicts. least far trump actually started new war. husband's situation. order groceries houshold items online delivery. target, shipt, amazon get almost everything. Rarely, rarely, either us go store. going store like going store think it. could also wear face shield mask change clothes leave house. started months ago. 100 times 911 Bill Gates, know-it-all billionaire  mother also believes ‚Äúnumbers aren‚Äôt real unrelated deaths labeled covid‚Äù theory that‚Äôs around since beginning.

It originated disingenuous doctor/senator (Dr./Senator Jensen Minnesota), since backtracked interview FactCheck.org, however, Jensen said think hospitals intentionally misclassifying cases financial reasons. now, im baitin here. Even scary number Canadians denial lies. know general population limited memory, intelligence both. Bunch simpletons.

I dont trust Health Canada government longer, chose straight lie us early days masks. thoughts.

1. hard read much lower rate hospitalization small populations.
2. kind emphasizes challenges trials early stage patients-most people get sick need large samples tease differences.
3. understand obviously benefits larger given early, one one track able make anywhere near enough give everyone early stage.
4. hope treatment successful they're looking like another treatment rather kind game changer.  Maybe misunderstand whole problem virus, people telling comments, entire reason bbqs parties youre going allowed right now: could directly hurting even killing someone KNOWING IT. huge amount covid cases asymptomatic still contagious. could presymptomatic week, meaning get symptoms developed yet still highly contagious. 

And already know that, deliberately causing harm others, really care gets way good time. Remember Fauci lied masks everyone worships kind diety? 7 household gun' fine what? üòÇ  honestly thought we'd 2021 headlines like this. row?  live india suburban area nominal measures face mask social distancing pretty much like normal. sure gatherings restaurants schools open stuff normal. 
it's crazy people forgotten ongoing epidemic.

I know lots indians going get salty comment is. people gets used living though conditions guess. Damn. Wish hadn‚Äôt moved Florida years plague hit. miss VT anyway, maybe go back... fuck man say  Well, clearly nothing went wrong (or re-started trial quickly). prissiness something routine? trial regulators look data, including adverse events, confidentially, ask questions they'll approve it. Move freak on. bars neighborhood operating bars. see, that's bars pal. ones ones without food. bar watching sports weekend. blast.  I'm feeling good. many accts make reddit trolling? Disgusting human being. Everything except grocery stores, Wal-Mart/Target, hardware stores, liquor stores.

There little reason leave house March May. What‚Äôs point? still small businesses primarily received benefits. bad apples make news.


I‚Äôm CPA clients greatly benefited PPP loan. You‚Äôre echoing propaganda. would case money went bailout large corporations didn‚Äôt pay back. happened.  thing university gave teachers students option entirely remote. at-risk teachers online aren‚Äôt many in-person classes begin with.

All food grab-and-go, basically prolonged exposure students. like said above, students could care less getting virus point. 

There isn‚Äôt huge amount partying school student body pretty compliant bought precautions (and located northeast less 10,000 undergraduates helps) don‚Äôt think much student body bought precautions fear, rather able hang friends again. masks essentially sold point didn‚Äôt really matter. sold places US even really talking pandemic. 

I can‚Äôt understand could started cotton face mask trend way earlier. ideal way better nothing. Schools arguing can‚Äôt control happens campus. ethically think form physics assault vs ‚Äúviral assault‚Äù feel like would. Nothing wrong weekend college partying get school stress out. year. hospital worker one point wearing glad trash bags ppe none. sorry whole idea scientific method consensus patently false

In science, fact repeatable careful observation measurement (by experimentation means), also called [empirical That‚Äôs called background study aka question trying answer. answered below. let quote you. Conclusions: Epidemiological, clinical, serological genomic analyses confirmed patient re-infection instead persistent viral shedding first infection. results suggest SARS-CoV-2 may continue circulate among human populations despite herd immunity due natural infection vaccination. studies patients re-infection shed light protective correlates important vaccine design.

The Spanish flu pandemic never ended. 4 official waves killed 500+ million people worldwide it‚Äôs circulating today aka seasonal flu. still kills people today. 

I‚Äôm giving benefit doubt, I‚Äôm starting think actually idea talking about. hot enough make onlyfans :( Bats source SARS1, Covid, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg, SARS2-COVID, possibly rabies. mammals fly, combination high body temperature species variation make special virus vectors. danger us humans habitats, human activity cut trees destroy homes, cross human habitats virus mix human viruses domesticated animal viruses, new viruses emerge immunity to. human deforestation/wildfires/climate change keep happening, number pandemics expected rise. Fauci said cheap masks wouldn‚Äôt offer much protection wearer. far know, still what‚Äôs nominally believed. main reason masking protect people.

Asymptomatic spread known time, means someone doesn‚Äôt symptoms, shouldn‚Äôt wear mask. do, quarantine. they‚Äôre quarantining, shouldn‚Äôt exposed people mask shouldn‚Äôt help.

In context, suggesting people wear masks could make people think they‚Äôre protected expose they‚Äôre actually protected.

Once asymptomatic spread comes picture, wearing mask makes sense isn‚Äôt possible know whether need quarantine not, barrier infection next best thing. even still usually hear people refer typical masks way reduce danger others, yourself. I'm constitutional law scholar though gut instinct power executive order mask mandate, power enforce it. I'm sure one mandated national level would legal challenges immediately. Though, might encourage people wear masks. psycho, narcissistic, etc? that's agreed to.  think that's true, maybe spend time abroad get perspective. Hard say. Spanish flu ended around 2 years without vaccine although I'm entirely sure ended without vaccine. get vaccine I'm sure we'll eventually get form treatment dramatically reduces deaths hospitalizations. could theoretically get herd immunity although remember reading quite large portion US would need catch covid would probably result whole load deaths really ideal solution. mention know long immunity lasts Bro he‚Äôs quarantining, that‚Äôs party house. He‚Äôs clearly responsible. hasn‚Äôt said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wear masks‚Äù ‚Äúmasks useless‚Äù endorsed use neutral. health authorites around world, e.g Sweden. diffference saying ‚Äúthey always useless‚Äù saying ‚Äúthe benefit yet quantified possible drawbacks can‚Äôt endorse general/for situations‚Äù  cleared. Time shut down. still saving lives. approach saving lives depends nature danger lives.

EDIT: Also. Locking car accidents make sense moment people go back road accidents start likely same, even higher, rate. 

With disease like covid locking somewhat actually reduce likelihood people die come lockdown Lemme put way.

I listening conservative talk radio car. matter country, conservatives always going government way.

Here, talk host saying usual blah blah blah can't trust government, flipflopping regulations long self isolate **so personal responsibility wear mask self isolate prevent spread disease rather waiting government tell it**.

I blown away. personally feel actually overestimate value We're philadelphia 76ers vaccine?! Oh üòÇüòÇ debunked anything. provided evidence. regurgitating shit programmed repeat.

Later, Russian n-p-c Imagine thinking lol? Even though see eye eye this; definitely appreciate responding way relatively rational, rather top batshit crazy. Seriously. Thank you! even effect much worse smaller would still helped tremendously first wave. fairness, less egregious Trudeau compared world leaders. Even test positive, told quarantine two weeks get back life, essentially did. Trump controls CDC orange bits four changes make. Perhaps get info looking for. Winter coming... see, misunderstood trying say. thought raising concerns capacity overload due increase COVID-19 cases respiratory infections well.

Your point well-taken; disagree strongly perspective proper solution, certainly understand point he's trying make. Two words: $how $much? disagree. think submission pertains pandemic. guess disagree. helped write rule though, feel pretty good interpretation it. course free take mod mail want though, wait reply, personally replying one sent obvious reasons. Lol, real experience. you? Imagine US implemented something like Covid spread everywhere across 50 states. Proof benefits worth unconstitutional actions state governments actual authoritarianism happening Australia think right. can't even get testing right. see Netherlands curve, see almost amount cases highest back 11th April disagree. goes nature danger two things.

Okay, we're talking something saving lives, whole idea good thing never suggested putting entire population indefinite house arrest it?

It's far Osterholm suggesting. Thanks Hey, guy thinks accountability tied color offending's skin taht hold people accountable wrongdoing protected victim status group. point making ""50 years"" claim plenty 30-40 year old coronavirus comorbidity listed death certificates. decades left.

How sure that? Let's take look 55 65 bracket: Obesity, diabetes 10k, that's one major reasons dying young. Quote: "" 6% deaths, COVID-19 cause mentioned. deaths conditions causes addition COVID-19, average, 2.6 additional conditions causes per death"". Let's state otherwise: young, healthy person wont die Covid. going need cite this. I've read plenty medical studies indicate SARS-CoV-2 10 times lethal regular flu. know getting number from.

Proportion COVID-19 deaths people &lt;65 years old; relative risk COVID-19 death people &lt;65 versus ‚â•65 years old; absolute risk COVID-19 death people &lt;65 ‚â•80 years old general population May 1, 2020; absolute COVID-19 death risk expressed equivalent death risk driving motor or: around 2 min mark would recommend beginning

More studies: Would open let experts different opinions topic open discussion TV Web? Would watch already comfortable opinion? really excuse performing worse third-world countries. got voted for.

Every country worse Vietnam kind bad argument there. read quite opposite, pretty good numbers compared similar vaccines trial. Also, article Moscow Times. sure much influence kremlin media doubt would promote self inflicted wound. üÜí NYC here, hotspot world spring.  everyone wears mask long term inside activities still closed. We‚Äôve 1% infection rate months now. socialism helps regular people. corporate welfare permitted oligarchy. [ridiculously well documented] point. MTA alone [lost 123  Initially, banned wearing masks. March 8th,[the MTA lifted ban employees wearing agency‚Äôs Chief People Officer Paul Fama sent memo employees Sunday noting allowed wear face masks job amid outbreak ‚Äúif underlying medical conditions makes feel comfortable time.‚Äù  memo departure Metropolitan Transportation Authority‚Äôs stance issue last week, agency‚Äôs Chief Safety Officer Pat Warren said ‚Äúmedical guidance indicates respiratory masks protect healthy people‚Äù ‚Äúat time may worn uniformed MTA employees.‚Äù

But still supply problems. belong local commuters' group social media group organizers encouraged anyone extra masks gloves bring bus drivers sufficient supply.

These people literally front lines, getting essential workers, health care workers, grocery store workers others, work. Yet actually banned beginning pandemic wearing masks.  corporate bailout talking about? People pull shit right ass. airlines pay portion back? PPP loan primarily benefited small businesses ones YELP referring shutdown? Another hint reinfection numbers might rise soon thing herd immunity SARS-COV-2. Lets hope first round vaccines already least help half population effective treatment others, vaccines evolve more. Shit wearing respirator grocery store February everyone store looking like insane. sweet innocent children back then. July he's past 14 day quarantine period recommended health professionals I'd say he's probably able actively spread virus. may even immunity virus although still know long immunity even lasts  agree, obvious going closed longer. Stop giving false hope want need travel countries. I've seen number posts people wanting travel back Canada wondering quarantine procedures border closures going lifted current deadline.  basically hoping things go back normal come back Canada without much hassle. However, that's false hope. Yup, thank goodness limited.
No way politically motivated fast tracked vaccine going arm. many opportunities much much better. thought prepared something like this. actual job lot people prepare this. I'm seriously disappointed. forget: CDC said wear masks, too. ""false sense safety."" Socially distancing absolutely helps. already know good deal respiratory droplets behave.

I go detail another comment plexiglass standards particular bar, suffice say safe indoor experience one could find right now, precautions theater.

That said, I'm participating Pfizer trial part participation involves leaving house normal activities (albeit masked distanced), I'll continue advance research remaining careful consideration safety around me. well mean selling bats months market.. knows long exposed many chances virus infect mutate. us didn't. think they'd none that. since bring up, really seems distinction without much difference.

I disagree. goes nature danger two things. drastically less obtrusive measures putting entire population indefinite house arrest.

It's good thing never suggested putting entire population indefinite house arrest it?

A ""lockdown"" (which shitty term) house arrest all, need be. 

There also levels done based data transmission spread virus is. sucks sense won‚Äôt happen earlier like said it‚Äôs realistic. Considering months ago though really feels like finally seeing glimmer light end tunnel awesome. Reddit nothing scientists!  come see little kids going data driven models better informed.  best scientists CCP shills sub. *Anyone supporting batshit-crazy anti-science opinion must Chinese bot. world makes perfect sense always right.* Nunerous countries actually give shit immediately began less UBI programs face shutdowns months. richest country history world well.

You're unhinged psychopath. Boris Johnson German government Robert-Koch-Institute lied masks well, beginning April narrative revised.

First wave hit much harder needed to. Research exists since years airborne pathogens massively reduced even simple surgical masks (just search google scholar 10mins care).

Of course, N95 even others best normal cloth masks surgical masks already make good strong impact since SARS-CoV-2 needs fluid droplets spread.

Asians already responded SARS 2003 constantly keep epidemics happening MUCH dense cities.

All fucking copy Taiwan South Korea no, ‚Äûexperts‚Äú ‚Äûleaders‚Äú knew better. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Isnt whole issue young people spread older people? winter either going tame regions country peaked now, we're going 200,000 new deaths January, depending ask. 

And vaccine could anywhere right election sometime first second quarter 2021.

Predictions basically place depends think right one. That‚Äôs sad, teachers buy educational supplies well. 

Hopefully teachers treated better future else kids want one grow up. going prevent COVID entirely? people mentioned still catch COVID jobs. New Zealand world‚Äôs second largest exporter. real people provide goods necessary human life society cannot work home. literally made every human stay home month society would collapse 10x harder timeline. Also even dream scenario perfect covid response, people working national security/defense sensitive positions still wouldn‚Äôt allowed ‚Äújust stay home‚Äù. corona would still spread, recent outbreaks New Zealand, whose economy, way, absolutely, 100%, *not* ‚Äúrelatively fine‚Äù. Almost little effect youth must masks. Oh, wait... Hey! guy can't hear dog-whistles!

Which weird, Trump talks like he's ref soccer match puppies. would otherwise cute... Nowhere article quote saying lied saying. I'm ready UBI. actually close everything though? sounds similar state, MD, restaurants bars closed, home depots Wal marts grocery stores popping off. anyone wearing mask indoors. Literally every day March April big depot stores packed brim. I'd consider real lockdown. part US ever approached true lockdown NYC, still pretty soft that.

Compare lockdown measures country like Italy China, really never anything close real lockdown. going rule stated. says *submissions* primarily pertain coronavirus associated pandemic. true football resuming potential vector infection, submission about.

&amp;#x200B;

I say y'all inconsistent treat sports submissions. never seem read saying. saying articles removed much pandemic effects written article posted. New Zealand locked again, SK faces rising cases Yeah simple minds wanna limit freedom science based conspiracy theories. Sounds familiar. summer started kids left school, assumed shutdown would school started back. boy wrong Yep. still lied billionaires get richer.  honestly say, people wouldn‚Äôt started stockpiling masks? run *toilet paper*? 

I‚Äôm saying right lie american public, told people stop hoarding things like tp sanitizer and... Americans exact opposite... *understand* lie, I‚Äôm sure pretending like Americans would reacted totally reasonably told yes, masks work. 'Flu season' exist, control measures necessary contain SARS-CoV-2 significantly effective far less infectious seasonal influenza.

The problem SARS-CoV-2 almost certainly also increase transmission. handful countries temperate region southern hemisphere able contain outbreaks became endemic usually flu season even arrived. Okay, personally blaming vs administration? You‚Äôve said time can‚Äôt pin crimes him, yet want punishment him. see that‚Äôs nonsensical?

The Holocaust isn‚Äôt enough ‚Äúignore‚Äù law - international law accused German Nazi party multitude war crimes human rights. can‚Äôt said nation‚Äôs dealing pandemic. want cause run N95 masks, saved medical professionals. us civilians, old strip cloth do. pretty sure vaccine also contain Trump's tax returns well. words best think publicity stunt worst thinks improperly tested vaccine potential toxicity issues. may conflating ‚Äúscience‚Äù ‚Äúauthorities‚Äù. said wear masks may positions authority, might reasonable assume recommendations based scientific research empirical evidence. wasn‚Äôt case. 

Typically, someone wants ‚Äúbelieve science‚Äù start showing science. Cite research, least describe evidence. 

When started began hearing ‚Äúmasks Healthcare workers, already sick‚Äù messaging CDC WHO, seemed obviously wrong. spent hours Google Scholar Sci-hub read selection actual research papers past hundred years showing masks work prevention viruses 125 nanometer range. help contain viruses worn sick (when used correctly) help protect healthy. 

Ultimately want rely science need literally believe science (Evidence), jut assertions people claiming scientific authorities. remember, scientist won‚Äôt explain views provide evidence isn‚Äôt much scientist. able provide concise explanation reached conclusion, including evidence logic. It‚Äôs hard usually done sentence two. 

One last thing - applies science-based topics. Avoid trap treating science like another religion. beauty science one ever ask believe something without evidence. make use that. Regarding protests, time reason think would fine. camp ""this going really bad"" month later pleasantly surprised wrong. That‚Äôs handle it....plus nearly contagious COVID-19. Severity symptoms/system damage contagion two different issues. COVID-19 bad fronts frankly comparable measles polio it‚Äôs contagion rather Swine Avian Flu. lied to. told masks work, even April. March, still telling us go Cruises. Hell, told us inacting travel restrictions bad idea, one country! places like New Zealand, kept borders basically sealed, ones semblance control virus. Fuck WHO, Fuck CDC, Fuck American Government No, US troops took flu Europe them. first recorded case Haskell County, troops brought back second wave.

Nice try though. California? Someone died COVID underlying conditions would likely died without underlying conditions. COVID lethal healthy individual, majority patients died also something else. death rate *healthy individuals* low. COVID + something else usually kills someone COVID. I'm sure many different ways need worded.  Yep 
India's deaths per mil much lower, obesity rate much lower countries India's population fairly young, average. looking engagement within next months. wedding plans are... long engagement. told ‚Äúwe‚Äôre probably going wait COVID get married, even it‚Äôs couple years‚Äù. Fine us. time plan perfect wedding without feeling rushed. Plot twist: They're not. capacity embarrassment ignorance behind actions. They'll find something someone else blame. Trump claimed covid worst pearl Harbour suggesting China engineered unleashed us purpose.
Of course crazy since China economy suffered lot virus.
If Chinese wanted unleashed covid, would done American city would let spread China happen.
But people got influenced crazy China hysteria.
[covid worse pearl Harbour says Find anti science Trumper nobody really cares. see, people actually trying go lives. ACTUALLY real world hopefully tomorrow better. volunteering trying grow business. hoping earn money expand business bringing jobs area. like sit around cry past. happened, done. actively trying figure make things better following it. People like sit around cry get way. constantly step people like gets tiring sometimes. Listen, know always people like slow things make things annoying everyone. type people critize everyone else offering nothing own. dealt types people entire lives. nothing new used it. Sometimes get annoyed people let stop them. keep crying past, nothing stop you. I'm sure seen done much good. hope one day actually start things actually make things better. would nice work better situation without navigate around people like part life. Maybe someday able offer real solutions actually get house help things. I'm saying won't. right let tell everyone bad everyone else everybody like you. want let know people really listening though. really realize people actually trying help things. know hard understand really happening. people dwell past become really can't anything today. busy forward. I'll let continue tell us stupid everyone is. learn much hear you. Without comments idea would able keep doors company open. Please let know gained rare knowledge? come it? Thanks help. Things really way better around. City budgets also completely destroyed. Income tax revenues far costs many cities declare bankruptcy.

Defunding police may happen places, necessity - along defunding everything else. bullshit.   Exactly...

But get ones think they‚Äôre little bit smarter rest say ‚Äúyeah it‚Äôs old people pre existing conditions, 6% normal people died covid...‚Äù

No, that‚Äôs wrong too.

Then hit fake news BS go again. GERD lately fucks breathing lightly terrified everytime corona going die. Doesnt help also immunocompromised. thankful though San Francisco denizens managed keep cases low. u guys celebrating? Hilarious. 94% cases, COVID listed #1, ""suspicion without actual lab tests"". I'll bet lab tests, lean towards ""suspected"". 6%. funny thing people reddit rewarding thread. would even want number bigger blame even Trump shows us much care dead people overreaction virus made businesses go bankrupt. shut everything down, there's evidence saved measurable amount lives. Everyone supported lockdowns feel responsible businesses going bankrupt. ""If worn masks shut 2 weeks, everything could gone back normal,"" valid response. excuse coping mechanism. Yeah, know much better everyone else... üôÑ  Fauci's first tussle politics national stage. really accurate say living ""completely boring life."" I'm sure older LGBT folks choice words handling suppose (I) can't slight error made.

Sure, also lie/mislead things got wrong. Partially. really enforced lot areas even considered ""mandatory"". still actual refuting. Got look chart Belgium‚Äôs deaths came early, it‚Äôs failing currently unprepared. Bad schooling. Yes. have. 

You know pre order commissioned project artist actually completed yet?

Eating average length table isn‚Äôt big deal especially usually go eat people interact already. misunderstand. I'm saying shutting first place greatest policy mistake history. policymakers intentionally inflicted world unprecedented wave impoverishment, starvation, despair lead civil wars, failed states, armed conflicts nations, unthinkable depravity. unforgivable they've done interest expanding power. think I'm this. Elderly patients especially worse outcomes advocate actually see them. ""damned do, damned don't"" situation.

I know people GA work seniors they've begging least allow 1 designated person visit (while following safety protocols, course)  Try reading comment stop virtue signaling getting weird, thanks. fact many people consider losing job end world actually serious issue modern society runs, really highlighted pandemic. never considered acceptable person basically left starve death happen end work wrong time. K-12 schools America starting last week lot closures don‚Äôt see many reported? know schools going disclose positive cases, happening without lot around country. comfortable Westerners engage re-enactment good ol' yellow peril. Asking societies dealt worse virus painful. Congrats carry like ! read whole article? Yep. blocked China, yet allowed gross diseased Italians show state's ski resorts spread it. Why? they're white, Asian. Countries better? nordic countries, Germany, UK, Iceland name negative attitude. course U.S. pull something off. U.S. pulled many victories many enemies beat Covid too.

The sad thing long taking us get disease control. China already pulled covid-caused economic slump, businesses open people working. pull far ahead us next decade, badly managed pandemic economy.  ""Chinese virologist"" claiming got ""evidence"" 6 months now.

Got source fresh load BS? Huh, please tell us like sociopath. *Mission Accomplished* not. truly given up, numbers would 2 3x bad. huge country. see idiots TV mean that's whole country is. Heart disease number one cause death US. Cancer closely follows number two. 

The third greatest cause death US respiratory diseases even surpass 150,000. 

So Covid confirmed 1/3 amount annual deaths #1 leading cause deaths US. still 3 half months Covid deaths add coming flu season truly know annual death rate. 

Also worth mentioning 200,000 number confirmed cases. Based number deaths far year compared previous years, actual Covid death toll predicted closer 350,000. 

If someone considers Covid deaths rounding error, must stupidest statistician ever walk earth. remember thinking 1 million crazy 600k probably high.

Those good times.... lied. could know. That's bullshit. Good point - edited clarify. unknown many safe effective, whether US able get enough ones are. wonder they‚Äôll cities....like would want whole nyc population taking subway specific hospital time take additional changes, location. specific bats location, many wet markets, SARS 1 source.  please keep mind positive test doesn‚Äôt mean much directly. ton inactive viruses floating around. flu last season probably still crap flying around could detected. good measure that‚Äôs skewed deaths. lo behold, Canada increase deaths ever since local Canadian epidemic end June. mention closing businesses stores basically stopping every day life. went shopping Feb 21st mask. pulled kid tiny school next weekend.

The CDC director said vaccine less efficient preventing covid simply wearing mask, I'd interested see happens even manage get America collapses lol That‚Äôs fine, wouldn‚Äôt even wear mask all. Don‚Äôt share ball. go shoot, totally fine America‚Äôs sweetheart, Dr. Fauci. He‚Äôs done good work, mask efficacy thing unconscionable. one thing case

üê£üê£ (PARODY NON-ACTIONABLE) call regressive puritanical unless reasons it. 

Like idea suggesting women hide face ""modesty"" regressive puritanical. 

Suggesting people wear mask respect health fellow person is, well, considerate. 

In places required public places expect we'll lower expectation virus hopefully recedes. 

In China Asian countries seen normal people wear masks even outside COVID. live Chicago area I've seen asian people wearing masks well COVID. 

It definitely foreign America, environment around us changes adapt change fit reality. Spain is. Source: I'm little possible still occasionally Okay fucking getting it? Covid 99.97% survival rate lol 40 worth talking various stages throughout world.

You'd think would've learned lesson now. Well, they're paying price. much ""herd immunity"", eh? Ohhh misread original comment saying Senate Republicans senate whole. bad. states populations 700,000 could probably control virus well Vermont. article absolutely zero proof trying say. infected bat takes time naturally? believe accidental, working vaccine delivery system. Also look timing many vaccine trials already had, we're administering. that, many things point containment. one would go since would mean gather relatives loved ones.  hope right, cause someone pushes Trump hard enough could see starting war keep feeling weak. Add he's basically trying trash NATO Russia start annexing old Soviet states start destabilizing democracies etc... 

It's small world, sure internal shit US really effect much, does.

Concensus agreement.. test. 100% certain exist? I'm 100% certain exist. Given crazies believe, probably better says masks don‚Äôt keep 5G. Stores would run out!!! referring scope US comment. federal government means taken care citizens  real, getting old. people chanting unironically trump rally (and every current disaster) going too. tired ass joke, also tired ass reality. stop now. Yeah I've getting laid way less often since pandemic started. world needs shut long needs to. everyone followed guidelines would things handled months ago people like keep spreading things extending lockdown. people listen all. think hoarding also started lies. people already lost trust. honestly believe hoarding caused lying can't bring reason lie. 

If need people wear masks like now. Large swaths public trust gov listen. 

If need lockdowns people listen trust government. Vermont, NH, Maine. Vermont practically indistinguishable Atlantic provinces anyway, except can't get good seafood. :( We'd blend right in. Please? can't tell trying troll point, I'll bow conversation. 

Goodbye nice day. often Vermont gets national recognition. really great job, commenters mentioned, population minuscule. 600,000 people entire state - even size small city. We're stretched across suburban rural communities, easy stay isolated. also much tourism.

All said, ton staters buying property sight-unseen, cash hand, want escape lives big cities. I've trying buy house last months near impossible properties spend day market get snatched up. really hope mean we'll see rise cases due people trying escape. Usually I'm people moving underpopulated state, time - they'll eating resources meant us. Here‚Äôs hoping!!! Less Shitty Leadership 2021!!! That's bad example though. air coming mouth chooses path least resistance depending badly mask closes around nose situation majority air come mask.

Cloth masks filter okay tested, filter okay literally finger width space sides nose. filter almost nothing. Saving show later. Thank clarifying that! def misread. never clear, however, pandemic began. Since influenza endemic disease, simply epidemic one, impossible answer question absolute certainty. Nonetheless, seven years work history pandemic, author conducted extensive survey contemporary medical lay literature searching **epidemiological evidence ‚Äì evidence available. review suggests likely site origin Haskell County, Kansas, isolated sparsely populated county southwest corner state, January 1918** pretty sure vaccination phase 3 testing also production well. know sure Oxford Vaccine mass production already, well pfizer. absolutely knew super early. think didn‚Äôt knew, weren‚Äôt following closely.  
Mask always great protection anything remotely flue like. reason wouldn‚Äôt case. lied keep inventory. 
I actually agree right lie, keep healthcare system inventory, don‚Äôt try turn ""they didn‚Äôt know"" lol. 
It fucking obvious top it. Anyone saying didn‚Äôt know probably started looking end February/March. fucking idiot. American, apologize us. stupid   China/Vietnam/NZ done it. 

Uh haven't. Last time NZ claimed eliminated virus go right back hard lockdown. also 0 reason trust China saying, seeing case count curve seen anywhere else entire world. full shit piece shit punched 16 year old theme park worker trying enforce mask mandate kids park near me. kid lost tooth needed surgery jaw. don‚Äôt blame businesses concerned employees deal maskless idiots. speculation hope

Not really. know 85% vaccines enter Phase III trials get approved. means 99.6% chance least one vaccine gets approved greater 60% chance three vaccines Phase III trials right approved.

We also know manufacturers ramping production right now, risk. stated capacity long take get there.

It hard run numbers see *most likely*, time next year, majority U.S. population vaccinated. understand HIV/AIDS works. It‚Äôs good parallel. don‚Äôt get it. Plenty people pneumonia ICU test positive COVID pneumonia due COVID, directly indirectly. would pneumonia even didn‚Äôt COVID. presence COVID alone isn‚Äôt proof ‚Äúpushed edge‚Äù., even pneumonia, much less less directly related disease. Disease complicated. It‚Äôs fine still don‚Äôt get I‚Äôm going keep tutoring you. Would interesting see proportion fines levied race. things always guaranteed heavily disfavor people color. Teachers stopped this, would realize problem fix it. 

I'm sure that's reason government provides inadequate aid poor--charity masking true scope problem. 

Christ.

Doing nothing rarely solution, least honest sending thoughts prayers. Remember, intolerable evil say ""we asked high risk-groups self-isolate"" intolerable evil flip say ""everyone must self-isolate."" don‚Äôt care think I‚Äôm Nazi tbh, I‚Äôd call cops people flagrantly violating social distancing mandates I‚Äôd damn proud You‚Äôre right. need put vacation plans hold while. that‚Äôs medical experts recommend it‚Äôs fine. recommending staying home proper say fuck that‚Äôs problem. Parents üòä IDGAF This. smart allocation vaccine able get death rate flu short order. mandatory Japan. However, societal pressure embarrassing shameful without one, so, based experience summer, 90% people wearing masks. Japanese habit wearing mask allergy season every year protect pollen, also sniffle cough courtesy others. Therefore, masking Covid big lift. think depends samples get sent. labs city tests, may why. new lab expanding in-city testing, options get quick results rather depending national labs.

It's huge problem something beat one arm tied behind back (or roughly 50% population contributing working goal). remains problem even get vaccine. propaganda, funded crony's Steve Bannon, meant take heat current guy charge. disinformation. evacuated Arkansas hurricane laura, made sure wear mask everywhere went. looked like fucking idiot people. Stores would signs front requiring masks employees even wear one.  it!!! others pointed here, language used article naive best. Willfully ignoring reality, likely.

Trump's president, governors free pretty much like. There's huge spectrum different states currently managing things, different groups Americans willing sacrifice name safety. inescapable facts.

So stop saying *""America needs lock down""*; discuss something realistic. Like ""*specific American states experiment locking down""*, most.

The good thing they're pointing towards New York demonstrated case (at least temporarily) keeping things control people social distance, wear masks governor committed reopening slowly carefully.

Li-Meng Yan's Paper

According Newsweek report, paper entitled ""Unusual Features SARS-CoV-2 Genome Suggesting Sophisticated Laboratory Modification Rather Natural Evolution Delineation Probable Synthetic Route"" published pre-print website Zenodo.

The paper authored Yan, became famous overnight due strong claims fleeing China come US.

Yan accompanied three researchers affiliated Rule Law Society, particularly known working infectious diseases.

Moreover, appears though Society founded former POTUS adviser recently charged Federal Bureau Investigation (FBI) fraud, along Guo Wengui, Chinese businessman fled China back 2014 due bribery charges more.

With that, many skeptical legitimacy paper.

'No Credibility Current Form'
Since speaking apparent origin COVID-19, many experts around world decided share thoughts controversial virologist, including colleagues, many saying Yan's research scientific basis.

Now paper released, news outlet consulted six leading experts evolutionary biology infectious disease, reaction: paper's scientific case weak.

""This pre-print report cannot given credibility current form,"" said Andrew Preston, microbial pathogenesis expert University Bath UK.

For unaware, papers published pre-print websites gone rigorous peer review, required papers published scientific journals, meaning paper precisely identified fact.

Moreover, paper's authors provided references support claims, critical research paper.

What Experts Say
Another scientist Newsweek talked also pointed issue author's explanation coronavirus' genomic analysis, pointing ""restriction sites"" genetic sequence COVID-19 virus evidence virus modified.

Arinjay Banarjee, virologist McMaster University, said, ""All DNA sequences nature restriction sites, surprising SARS-CoV-2 genome also restriction sites. evidence presented anecdotal.""

Banarjee also skeptical Yan's claims furin-cleavage, part coronavirus' protein spike, deliberately added virus.

Meanwhile, University California evolutionary biologist, Jonathan Eisen, said paper ""filled unsubstantiated claims,"" another evolutionary biologist University Washington, Carl Bergstrom, called paper ""bizarre unfounded.""

Unfortunately, despite previous evidence back prevailing theory COVID-19 came bats, many still believe Yan's thesis coronavirus theories offered scientific evidence.

To stop panic decided lie &amp; made everything spread more. literally killed people instead honest needing masks healthcare workers. 

I still can‚Äôt believe &amp; I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll ever fully trust government agency scientists/doctors government again. That's works bud.I want dick, can't trust CDC give accurate info, trust? bunch headline skimming idiots... CDC bunch liars. That's big deal.. travesty. case already happening. UK started limit groups 6 fairly sure coming weeks things shut again. Trumps snowflakes nothing actually matters affects directly got tons money he's trying help. Seems like best thing enjoy life give shit others. mainly fault he's getting involved society problems. pity him. WE‚ÄôRE WINNING!!!! 

.... think anyone vt going happy see anyone coming north, especially Florida. No. know know that? break region excess death always spikes epidemic begins.   many new businesses created since covid hit? many businesses closed since covid hit?

Small business failure usually within 6 months. p1&amp;p2 estimated flu deaths, verified flu deaths. you‚Äôre comparing number actual verified COVID death numbers have, kindly divide ~5 get much less flawed comparison.

Tried driving wrong way one-way street, country considered pretty bad! passed roght past policement signaled ""good morning lol, carefull!"". 

It early morning trafic, seem cool people taking short cut going opposite way one way street ""if probably meet anybody"".

So they're like covid regulations, small wonder can't get control. RemindMe! 1 Year That, whole slew people used vote Democrat abandoned corporatist Democrats 4 terms, leaving angry susceptible jingoism nationalist rhetoric.  can't find Clorox Wipes paper towels, somehow tests available widely cheaply?

There sources change mind push agenda. Considering people stockpiling hand sanitizer toilet paper live price gouging probably reasonable tried make sure health care workers could access masks Dr Fauci said couple months ago US didn‚Äôt need lock long people adhered public health guidelines: wear mask public; maintain social distance; wash hands frequently well; avoid crowds, especially indoors. Cool story bro CDC released figure saying 6% covid deaths pre existing conditions. example idiot making comment good response THANK YOU! Yup, exactly. ""old"" here, savings quadrupled since March without transport, vacation, restaurants, etc. spending clear things control. Canada 10th largest economy. Statements like understand mutual benefits gained bilateral trade agreements. They're priority that's I'm talking about. understand concept topics?? Asian countries lived SARS/etc past decade far better initial response infrastruture western world majority US 18s non white? would expect die 50% total deaths even otherwise.

Given Hispanic childhood obesity cola consumption nuts surprised dying more. Plus Hispanic kids illegal parents might reluctant seek care children. Fuck yeah. USA number 1!! *Checks notes* 

Oh.... main question ""what lockdown"". Totally restricting people's freedom absurdly ineffective, government seems think, extremes. think could get epidemics control, government less inept, less focused PR, and, first foremost, less fixated ""saving money"", loses much money long run. would look like?
1. Stop absurdity tracing epidemiologists, accept already existing offers business sector get professional call centers non-expert operators. open hiring thousands tracers. Stop using outdated beaurocracy. Stop trying save money tests.
2. Force work home business unless thay absolutely can't (have physical working machines). Nobody allowed sit desk office, including government employees.
3. Identify risky businesses close - paying reasonable compensation business go bust. Unwilling definitely, we're unequipped unwillingness. could gave freed funding keep people afloat couple months burns out. could found legal pretext limit travel states. Politicians could reached constituency made understand necessary appealed much ballyhooed sense patriotism instead exact opposite encouraged revolt, dissent, distrust medical experts.  political failure pure simple. problem businesses want endanger workers safety engaging anti-mask lunatics. People literally shot telling customer wear mask.

From employee standpoint almost lose lose. Engage risk safety risk COVID.

We tried half ass shutdown work. Everyone sick staying home getting worse people want stringent shutdown. Even folks telling everyone suck April may eating restaurants basically saying fuck now.

Edit: also.....if make business choose money (like huge fine) employees safety....sadly many choose money. u say NY 6 months restrictions fully opened lmao know it‚Äôs true viral loads play you‚Äôre reducing intake 70% cloth mask you‚Äôre still better without anything. even reading I'm saying? arguing something say.

Should done things differently? Yes. I'm replying suggestion done hard nationwide lockdown February. social assistance happening. Got solutions? 40 million people ending homeless answer. Great? people died car accidents, mean demand speed limit everywhere 15. Bill‚Äôs idiot, understands completely bet wasn‚Äôt going anywhere without mask kicked think theory might impacted new york times report test processors spinning tests many cycles effectively find small, dead, non-contagious fragments corona, thus declare positive case? Asia learned long ago.. US one problem crawled ass forgotten think. Don‚Äôt take recommended dosage!!!

If search vitamin recommended dosage get half dozen different numbers :( UAE imposed rules. Businesses getting fined 14k (dollars) complying. People, depending position, 1,400 dollars. never made sense masks would bad thing. want wait anyway significant concern. I'd give prisoners first, military personell, college students. Maybe small amounts risk group people time they're likely require care vax.  German official talked strong fine, sadly sound like jailtime likely. 

And doubtful US anything given run people stifled, like were, infection rates continue dissolve, including masks. upset models predictions used right? open shit because, open need money. prediction models take account allowed open loosely freely, feel, due exclusively fact negative predicted outcome weighed current infected uninfeccted.

At point dont think mandates something base science around. know knew seems like science politics can't agree anymore I'd rather choose science. Sweaty angry people can't bully human body works. Yep I‚Äôll stay locked long it‚Äôs recommended. 

Thanks much saying fuck making lockdown last longer don‚Äôt give shit others. type/brand FFP3 using? got (1231 think) [JSP MARTCARE FFP3 backup thin cloth covered foam seal favorite... you‚Äôre small stature, Pass y‚Äôall come across some. Trump know?
He must of.
So president USA lied country....in beginning wearing mask said made look silly. Half country took permission infect half. going sweep through.

Take look outside, already process sweeping through. true. think probed. Hospital admissions good test. ICU occupancy well. 

Look, test positive, don‚Äôt symptoms, don‚Äôt even need go doctor, stay chill home bit, what‚Äôs problem then? need clamp hard (and imagine happen winter)?

I absolutely agree start whole thing lock idea dealing with. getting ridiculous. Dead parents something. leadership, expect? shouldn‚Äôt leave house might get sick she‚Äôs asymptomatic. selfish.  Alaska, rationing tests (last time checked) don‚Äôt sufficient reagents swabs. really believe numbers China gave you? profoundly better businessman Donald Trump, built empire intellect, much wealthier trump, people voted trump ‚Äúhe‚Äôs good businessman‚Äù would scream bloody murder Gates ran president. would listen Bill Gates literally every issue Donald Trump. I'm sure 14,661 dead Texans 701,764	infected Texans would, reasonable basis, disagree absurd statement. Texas cases longer going down. Yeah, stuff actually happened. 

All done type text reviewed scientific data consensus.

And yet still shared that. come people like assume posting link debunked claims non-relevant information amounts anything useful?

Debunked how? evidence?

Again, reply going back evidence. 

Oy, like pulling teeth. jfc ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Speak yourself. Got N95's February. Ok. lockdown forever. I'm going go back living life spring.

I'll keep mask public continue distance strangers comes hanging friends, I'm done ruining mental health. I'm going back normal catch it, catch it. is: unempathetic person. Explains callous disregard others lives. What's even disgusting callously disregard people would demand save life ailment.

The reality is: countries locked hard fast actually leadership gives af citizens come already economies fine. half assed troglodytes like crying go month without eating leadership far interested robbing crisis. ounce civic duty body understand this. 

Refute want honestly dgaf point. data facts there: done South Korea even fucking Germany we'd fine. nope. Wow, really blatant fear mongering. terrible article  Feel free stay locked forever, won‚Äôt neither people. Hopefully death bed look back nice fulfilling life inside 4 walls. China admirable qualities also terrible human rights violations. countries better, general. Correct. communist country impossible. Yeah happening. People worn out, part part govt scale PPE, contact tracing test isolate. whole point flatten curve. may academically right talking pure clinical outcomes happening. fucked royally national plan govt completely wasting spring summer periods. need geezer's opinion masks politics. words Monty Python: ""I vote him"" ‚Äúonline‚Äù job retail, healthcare, blue collar, multitude jobs. Yeah totally. Covid ‚Äúsolved‚Äù everyone alive paying much attention it, climate change different story. payed fraction much attention climate change covid, could make lot progress front. society, we‚Äôre giving climate change lot less attention needs, even though long term it‚Äôs bigger issue covid could ever :( thought narrative masks protect people, wearer.

We learning go along, recent thing I've heard reduce amount viral load exposed making illness far less severe. First find available area yet. ... ones go N110 

May ask, seriously, always devolve name-calling sub? think equally nutty put eggs 'suppress virus' basket even *consider* implications economy/mental health/physical health/substance abuse/starvation/etc? say, sounds little crazier. city Jena became early adopter masks public transport shops April 6, new infections municipality 108,000 almost disappeared. surrounding state Thuringia elsewhere Germany adopted mask policies days weeks later outbreak many areas continued spread, according a¬†paper¬†from Institute Labor Economics Bonn. Bulgaria became mandatory really really fast too. Holy shit really triggered! sorry way. It‚Äôs fault makes feel better early 40s, ones genes countless opportunities propagate... True, won‚Äôt enough vaccine everyone first. We‚Äôll need produce quickly possible. Caucasian people referring people believe freedom taken away, government trying control them. anti-scientific, believe conspiracy theories credible factual source. reflection education system United States failed us. serve fodder anti-mask Karens. welcome! Someone pointed me, passing on. Lol yeah didn‚Äôt even wanna get that. Okay, that‚Äôs good know. Again. virus...does. Not. Give. A. Single. Fuck. 

Just saying fuck going back work safe solution. things need done like social assistance. shut fuck Amazing say confidence without clue vaccine they're talking - mentioned one.

Unbelievable top comment. Actually, perfectly believable. crowd loves mock anti-vaxxers managed become even annoying breed anti-vaxxers (stock prices! Trump!). They're delusional think people going continue social distancing + masks long lmfao. even see lasting holidays people go back normal regardless whether vaccine not. Things pretty much back normal I'm everyone goes along restrictions half-hearted ways. early covid thought buying prescription ski goggles regret so. would gotten much use now. I‚Äôd interested hear pediatricians many fewer respiratory viruses, stomach bugs, ear infections, etc. disappeared. Likewise think Lice Clinic probably bad year. 

No ‚Äúback school flu‚Äù year family. think 1% infection rate he‚Äôs referring % tests positive.

Thanks information. common refer ""infection rate""? Seems bit strange me; test infection rate goes down. Sweden exception least justified war. weird case medical professionals, desperately need take care sick patients, would've gotten sick compared average Joe decide 1000 N95s. 

What done better managed collecting much PPE possible banned sale public something. way could still get cloth masks pro grade stuff went right healthcare workers. still requires everyone board working together efficiently, clearly case. New reddit/this sub, I'm sorry I'm posting anything that's repetitive. COVID end March/early April lost sense taste smell 3 weeks. that, came back gradually enjoyed couple months everything seemed normal. began experience symptoms parosmia-- taste/smell seemed dulled experienced certain familiar smells distinct foul odors. began late June continues til day. anyone else experienced this? anyone else experienced end (please!). Would love input, anecdotes, advice.  That's ok. means better things us, welcome it. I'll learn deal family. would say though back normal - really seen new normal, hope. I'm hoping people take sick seriously calling work sick wearing masks sick/wanting avoid getting sick seen normal. hugs handshakes. I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôve seen sub Cake... death? actually quite confident EU approved vaccines thoroughly studied implemented. welcome go first. Dr. Fauci told people wear masks. Unforgivable. expect mine fall 2021 (I‚Äôm 26 lowest priority), I‚Äôm looking forward able go public (with mask on) feel much safer knowing people vaccinated.

I‚Äôd obviously prefer get back normal months I‚Äôll grateful improvement situation am. going first one agree short term lock beneficial major urban centers. can‚Äôt read second nyt makes impossible read shit fir free went college! competitive experience people went earn degrees. 

If college socialization, nation stop subsidizing it. People get wasted laid dime.

But course college for. learning, subsidize people take opportunity seriously. Fair enough. Still worst ever fall. see plays out. point is, clearly winning strategy.  U.S. case death totals many things, they're definitely ""spiking"" ... Question: anyone know would take 6-9 months EUA vaccine? presume anticipate take 6-9 months get health care workers, first responders, 65+ fully vaccinated. struggle manufacture vaccines 6-9 months? imagine it‚Äôs likely scenarios, hope go faster CDC opinion might tempered timeline.

Edit: ask guaranteed government vaccine manufacturing contracts ‚Äú100 million doses X, 30 million doses Y, etc‚Äù end 2020. I‚Äôm curious contracts meet manufacture ring promises long shot, even current front-runner vaccines approved. hopeless. Anyone posts source White House website going acknowledge anything else regardless indisputable facts. waste time person. don‚Äôt. wear masks nothing else due social pressure. got fancy cool looking ones. 

But yet see actually effective. SARS1 MERS confirmed originally passed human animal outside lab environment. may well case situation different, I've seen reason assume believe case. adds layer complication explanation without evidentiary basis. least, far see. live Canada masks still mandatory well. currently one active case province. 

The US approach Canada's approach covid 19 prevention completely different depending province - federal issued orders provincial governments also get make decisions. 

I can't speak provincial government every province, impressed proactive provincial government enforcing mandatory masks. rare wild somehow likely random bat caught wild brought lab virus? Given far smaller sample size comes human bat interactions lab compared wild, latter better odds occurring? college athlete would give anything compete right now. ""job"" us, enjoy competing. hate whole unpaid university slaves narrative going around. want compete. So, understand immunity amnesia unusual circumstance, right? Meaning uncommon? they‚Äôre getting better treating it, masks helping attenuate viral load, it‚Äôs younger people getting it, dozens reasons. It‚Äôs complicated. difference homeless going make money, people going choose making money. can‚Äôt force people stay home without sort financial assistance. Precautions always help, there‚Äôs surge cases area precautions won‚Äôt enough money. Bars complain they're losing customers, govrrbement bends opens up. Soccer stadiums full enough? Zip goes pants government. find relaxed less hurts afterwards. tense sucks definitely severe lasts longer Absolutely fucking wrong, Asian countries leading way masks used. West ignored completely went ""research"" quote. Needs 'Murca translation. First tell us Bill Gates gonna mind control us 5G implants steal God's perfect breathing system away us God fearing worker bees devils mask. believe technical term ""shit's gonna go down"".

We live unchartered territotories here, worldwide leverl; sure another pandemic 1918 back world quite different place:

* less 2 B people 
* much less mobility / transportation, especially international
* less interconnected world econmy
* econmies based raw materials/goods services

Today's advantages are:

* better tech/science/medicine
* better means communications
* faster means transportation (for PPEs/vaccine)

Buckle up! created exactly WWII. want petition UN Trump done par Nazi Germany, means go ahead. get concede has/hasn‚Äôt done criminal world-scale, support problem. don‚Äôt see happening. Show one graph country introduced mandatory masks infections deaths dropped. Seriously. would like see it. Show hard scientific proof particular virus dealing stopped. Early days yet. took couple years confirm original source sars, suspicions things take time. Colleges business too. It‚Äôs time say so. Also, say 20% people infected antibodies. suppose different 30% people still self-isolating, going out, ordering stuff in, etc.

You effectively end 20% 70% people population, closer 28% infected looking society. incredibly small part population. sure point is. like point, could waited companies release phase 3 data efficacy making claims. data looked hinky, means, shout roof tops. looked good, though, irreparable harm towards public acceptance vaccine. data, solely based political climate, vaccine tested. data smaller phases suggest cause alarm, US actually likely overly cautious continuing pause Oxford trial pending data. may right. We‚Äôll know soon enough safety precautions effective. not, season canceled. CCP sole governing body China, yes communist. interlinked two states? May interest graphs show every single nation failing contain infection numbers increased last months including countries mentioned. lets single america gang bang 95% world failing also. Pathetic bunch might underestimating absolutely idiotic average American is, one 65% Americans ""concerned"" COVID, fuck would go restaurant, social distancing not? get talked enough. proper quarantine procedures, along testing contact tracing, essential interrelated trifecta. live Washington DC metropolitan area. Trust me, absolutely zero process quarantining visitors come nation's capital. They've walking around, quarantine, testing, requirements. insane. He's literally video saying essentially this. Socialist Canada beats Capitalist US

... again. basically said that, also unfairly bashed people getting fatigued using phrases like ‚Äúmade-up freedoms‚Äù ‚Äúselfish asses.‚Äù implied people okay 2 weeks turning 8 months, reality it‚Äôs perfectly okay get fed timeline start living life problem one week lag? countries report quicker?   obvious lies anyone looking it.

I've wearing mask since mandates started rolling in.

People sides ridiculous. Call out. source that? think Americans health bad. Lmao Agreed, think restaurants businesses (barely) survived expanded outdoor seating... we're month away impossible. exactly. say ""Save PPE medical staff means please use shirts, random cloth scraps, etc make homemade masks wear them."" Done done. \^\^\^

What Adrien said.   masks underestimated, know East Asian countries wearing masks (and probably still are) throughout pandemic clearly studies already done previous outbreaks within region.

What happened government afraid people would eat supply masks therefore leave health services lacking. lied told people ineffective. believe one minute studies done China shared governments across globe.

This reason people trust governments, believe misinformation online taking pandemic seriously.

It's like Boy cried Wolf.

You make up.  Sooo .... saying throw caution wind go restaurants saying go out? I'm honestly sure read comment. Another gift courtesy China. Mourning moment, daily, get situation. question whether Canadian public let common sense basic knowledge rule decisions? would explain Canada hit hard US. US, seem lost collective minds enough population utterly lacking common sense keeping numbers elevated making whole situation worse.

I never bought idea simple cloth face coverings bad thing. Therefore, I've wearing public setting, limit, since mid-March. aside, Dr. David Brenner Columbia University started testing technology roughly 7 years ago Kobe University Japan verified efficacy technology, also fact safe. use eximer emission source light filters ozone well making environmentally friendly.

I would strongly encourage read technology given application Covid 19 also many infectious diseases.

&amp;#x200B;

[Ted Talk B1 FDA link offers link Dr. Brenner's innovation well. second paragraph denotes Far-UVC light (222 nm) efficiently safely inactivates airborne human coronavirusesExternal Link Disclaimer). !&lt;

[FDA current obstacle getting ACGIH(Governing body UV emitting light sources) green light higher exposure limit given last study conducted far uvc 1970s. believe close finished. company engineers light, USHIO already begun selling provided light source hospitals government entities Japan months ago. technology readily available now, guess many done requisite research find news amazing tech. Yes P100 best  **Good things done Belgium:**

Counting aggressively, means COVID numbers fit excess mortality - happen.

**Bad things done Belgium:**

* Diddle daddle instead taking early measures
* government even wipe asses unless France wipes first. like balls take decision, follow France like bunch idiots
* Fuck orders PPE ordering scammers
* Piss gains gotten lockdown imposing usage masks shops indoor places, allowing numbers go back again
* generally incompetent dealing crisis

Which happened: Show pandemic movies people don‚Äôt stand together disease race instigated protests would usually think would make sense. Based covidpilled  gonna dawg think wearing masks social events take away entire purpose social events?

Smart people attending social events right now. Cases still uptick winter coming, additional flu cold reduce transmission, eliminate it. that's case, allowing non-essential businesses open all?

I think ridiculous, too. Non-essential businesses open whip thing. we're looking strike balance mitigating risk keeping people cognitive dissonance required say going grocery shopping without mask selfish going vacation Las Vegas totally fine wear mask staggering.

I agree. People trying live lives like nothing going need better perspective new normal. contain virus vaccination, we're going back 2019, that's even possible anymore. responding someone saying felt bad people living lol. feel bad, great here. People still risking lives get here, covid covid.

Everyone country lottery born Nice shut schools please Guns kill people, exsanguination merely hastened old age.  Let lesson rest world. win everything!  even try step undefeated steak!

And [a reminder](http:///www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/in-the-early-days-of-the-pandemic-the-us-government-turned-down-an-offer-to-manufacture-millions-of-n95-masks-in-america/2020/05/09/f76a821e-908a-11ea-a9c0-73b93422d691_story.html) January 22, US federal goverment contacted US company mothballed N-95 factory Texas. factory could produce **1.7 million N-95 masks every week**, feds *turned down*. could disproven? even talking Biden? I'm talking Democrat leadership congress use every opportunity try attack trump.

If good information, made priority?

If democrats knew exactly reduce number deaths NYC control? worst numbers there? Either coronavirus naturally worked way human population or, Chinese laboratory really involved, virus probably studied researchers accidentally infected one them.

Yep. article seem addressing possibility lab leak. scrutinized normal ordinary part scientific process. 

Saying authoritatively lab created active debate research conducted bad faith journalism.

There plenty well credentialed researchers virologists say looks lab created, give reasons. minimum say debate, jury still out, scientific community split, etc.

I know hard people understand accept scientific theories need consensus. There's even consensus things like gravity wave-particle duality. totally normal. science partisan dogma.  P100 respirator Yes could billionaires profit that? 

US govt: one care poor billionaires wall street? do, God yes do! grossly misguided. 65% people somewhat/very concerned incremental gain see catering reckless would dwarfed number people avoided going establishments result. argument makes absolutely zero sense. right rate deaths 30k month. 300k dead new years nothing changes. HELL ""purely political"". president's name it? terrible bot healthcare workers? I've close contact Covid-19 patients months now, facility refuses test unless show symptoms. Just-in-time delivery means grocery stores enough stock small subset population get 1 week‚Äôs worth groceries. It‚Äôs going happen matter much want people welded houses starved. Comparing peak weekly verified death count COVID-19 peak weekly verified death count recent Influenza season reveals ~25x many people died worst week COVID-19 worst week flu. Go back worst week worst flu season since 2013 it‚Äôs still 10x much deaths. 

That worst week COVID accounted **nearly 25% recorded deaths US week**.

Source: [this disturbing graph made comparing verified death counts two  lol Bullshit.
 
There absolutely nothing indicating case.
 
At all. Also worth noting 75% country underlying condition Lol think I'm going spend time reading shit. Get help dude. much anger aggression good immune system. That's makes sense interesting, thank you!  I'm saying ridiculous thing base country on. Lol downvoting every comment. Another thing didn‚Äôt like Trudeau trying push new laws started quarantine since lot easier panic  trial

Lmao, what? holding everyone gun point force stay home? Even reactive states still liberal ""essential services"" policies everyone abused. community effort half country give shit. Blame neighbors. I'm getting there. always wear masks around strangers work getting point going start hanging friends like old times.

Zoom, masked outdoor gatherings, online gaming substitute intimacy.  Correct. whole slew research disposal work SARS. many studies effectiveness masks... mask, N95. 


Edit: [There 17,000 effectiveness masks pertaining SARS (not SARS-CoV-2) also said april wearing mask almost ineffective so..... Thanks! That's I'm thinking too. skeptical parents' thinking **has** reaction vaccine. That's silly. Someone say diabetic live long full life monitoring blood sugar using insulin needed. also realize people Florida Georgia live differently New Yorkers too. houses mostly single family homes. yards separating us neighbors. wide streets walk pass close someone else. us cars us public transportation. 

Its lot easier social distance still somewhat normal life. walk dog without mask live single family home huge yard. walk around neighborhood never pass within 50 feet another human. brain-damaged? herd immunity exist.

Uh beaten many ENEMIES, yes. physical wars actual enemies. VIRUS. storming beaches normandy ffs. reason, lot people hard time differentiating two lol even hospital workers lock down?

What severe case COVID? treat you? Remember ‚Äúif you‚Äôve chicken pox, shingles virus already inside you?‚Äù 

Let‚Äôs see who‚Äôs laughing find covid come back 10 years like AIDS something. fucking serious? know asymptotic transmission 9 months shit? guys. 200,000 deaths. done without all. No, normal.

I'm critical Russian vaccine lack testing quasi-emergency approval (if connections Russia right now, get vaccine), none side effects would tank trial. `can't bother` lied `lol`

You seek help vivid, ""clear"" recollections things evidently never happened. [As stated Article 93 UN Charter, 193 UN members automatically parties court‚Äôs includes US. Learning science new information? Hypocrisy!

Even IFFFFF straight up, bald-faced lie, Fauci probably good reason. Like preventing idiotic Americans hoarding every single mask doctors none. Trump lies every single fucking turn, benefit himself. fuck talking about? lie destroys public trust. knew local official. can‚Äôt believe world leadership didn‚Äôt know that. took us March September many deaths took March April. That's huge difference. Housing prices bad outside BC/Ontario/Quebec. Even within provinces, bad farther big cities like Vancouver/Toronto/Montreal fear mongering truth.

Its also extreme think it. Thousands 66 million high number all. It‚Äôs like vaccine anyway care many ppl gotta kill go see 

Excellent idea - find top US diplomat kill them, extradited US trial time. Thanks concern dumb. I'm fine thanks. 

So saying 6 weeks general public? mean, say so. heard repeat thing, people believe even true. Classic propaganda strategy. risk giving chance repeat third time, chance call what's called ""broken record"" style propaganda.

Want insult again? Cause dumdums fall ""broken record"" propaganda also associate abusive language showing strength masculine. get one two punch cause, guest.

Go ahead.

1. Repeat message
2. Insult show strong Read article maybe? Last read, likely drive central locations in-state. least one finicky (needs super-cold storage) dispense drugstores drs offices. 

And may need go twice, two shots month apart, wait two weeks second shot take hold.   welcome post articles. small depressing enough sub good news tends get upvoted. outright lying us. They've flopped completely, going saying masks pointless help literally saying they're better actual vaccine. everybody would stay home 2-3 weeks would over. span almost year. 

Spanish flu killed 50 million working 1.8 billion. Covid's working 7 billion.  got mine 18 hours free mobile clinic Western Washington (PCR test). quality testing really varies lot region. Rushed US vaccine: Mana Heaven.

Have reading subreddit? flaw argument nobody actually cares whether public education slightly shittier teachers putting extra time.

So yeah, get it, need value time, overextend yourself. also believe working contract hours going catalyst change think is.

Yes NYPost carp. they're capable reporting direct quote. Take one second google fact check yourself. Tegnell's quotes EVERYWHERE. nothing remarkably persistent denial mask efficacy.

Internitwits exasperating. tell hair red.

Check Bill Melinda Gates Foundation focus on. I'm *all* *simple things* reduce spread Covid, masks one-way aisles measures.

And cookie theory pretty weak. First, someone takes 10 minutes choose cookies, gonna wait 10 minutes matter direction came from. Also, go shopping 20 items, many walk grab (18? 19?) many ""wait 10 minutes"" another indecisive customer move (1? 2?).

You seem suggesting spend 10? 20? 30? minutes shopping waiting people move. think math whacked.

Obviously one-way aisles solve covid alone. absolutely *helps reduce* people's exposure other's exhalation. least Leatherface thrown fit wearing masks.

This seems heart issue. lack source quote makes think editorialized. 

Scaling tests later Finland, [stated (figure 1 2 legends). problem is? also see collected every week never paused. 

Or... maybe mean testing children prioritized testing numbers low. really ill get tested. That's big secret though.

The rest big rant full inaccuracies claims Swedish strategy herd immunity. Since can't get something repeated multiple times right, confident quote fair. flu shot always correct strain though, guess strain make population. Hey little donny cultists hard work here. live Stockholm I've seen maybe 10 peope masks total time.

Wow. Must nice. Yea, go work anywhere sick get others sick want take day inconvenience yourself, that's selfish. practically textbook selfishness....you would twist logic pretty badly considered (which referring comment, logic twisted). Kind wild Wall-E movie got right surprised? didn't. 

I trying say anti-mask viewpoint make sense risks (if any) wearing masks small compared benefit (even fully effective). gets blown proportion - ""I medical condition"" ""breathing CO2 day"" (lol say virus small stopped masks, air molecules not?) lies.

Talk Sweden. US gov right first time. Job security  Iowa, enough said Masks mandatory, time worn prevent pollen allergens (and China, pollution) season. March actually saw *least* masks people shortage, many people wear normally complaining about. 

However, people take masks indoors. 

For me, masks took long recognise efficient Japan, people wear masks sneeze cough openly, without covering mouths, makes kinda useless. (It's funny someone coughs without covering mouth goes take mask afterwards, like that's useless!). 

To fair, they're worn public transportation usually. taken supermarkets etc. legally enforced, common. However, again, people coughing openly never felt safe... Maybe ya'll gone partied like 1999. thats like advicing crackhead dont crack Yellow Light. associate unintelligent men Yeah, plenty people balance studying partying. feel bad anyone party fun least sometimes college. 4 years fun. We've got rest lives work miserable... /s find friend virus contact, course would quarantine get tested.

I think point need start taking calculated risk. article New England Journal Medicine proposes theory looked into.

Essentially masks lessen viral load, inoculation virus symptoms greatly reduced

Here's USA USA USA! America Number 1!!! evidence long term effects common disease. anecdotes. Stay inside vaccine. Young healthy people live lives debate still had. something like twice total deaths per capita europe whole, dramatically higher deaths neighboring countries. argument Sweden handled well?

Edit: plot 7d avg deaths per capita basis Sweden, neighbors rest counties Baltic (apologies missed Yeah, I'm talking T-cell disinformation 50% pre-existing immunity going around. could've told us make dang masks, would've fucking done lines get would biblical proportions... know....just wear masks close proximity people. One hopes temporary, world look past 4 year lapse. allies holding breath November 3rd. Russia dying see Trump re-elected, weaken influence Europe open new inroads Russian expansion. Even China wants Trump unpredictable make trade difficult.  give January people won‚Äôt give fuck, already don‚Äôt is. Even mask mandate (Wisconsin), local businesses employees aren‚Äôt even wearing masks we‚Äôre point 90% giving fuck. Literally thing around winter go bars/restaurants drink. Hospitals haven‚Äôt overwhelmed even do, one care. still wear mask, social distance, etc. think need move eventually happen finally recommended people wear cloth face coverings? fact that, 9 months pandemic knowledge potential side effects covid, still counting cases deaths acting two things aspects matter bit wild me.

But well, that's media works Oh yeah. think continue time. person work. Family gatherings. Restaurants, movies. Even sporting events think people fine it.

They'll wear masks avoid unnecessary touching, otherwise people going mucb else imo. us, compromised Hey man, careful wearing masks, that's fine. say fuck it, friends end spreading virus you, better fucking quarantine. Otherwise really selfish. going soon Japan‚Äôs death total... daily. 

Tragically sad. believe objectively debunked false claims. It‚Äôs amazing sure yourself. yes, it‚Äôs tiresome. people don‚Äôt care evidence hide head sand presented facts. Next time prepare better instead making Chinese flag memes. walmart losing thousands dollars pretty cool actually hypothesize may came lab want blame China. mostly want conversation inherent dangers facilities nature generally gain function research specifically. cite source that? apply equally urine testing referring specific testing kit someone know used? Paying $50 blood test check I‚Äôm deficient last time tried going insurance, denied didn‚Äôt reason. Apparently family history low vitamin enough. assume Snopes said 'False'? Feb. 29, 2020, interview, Dr. Fauci said time circumstances pertaining date, Americans need change behavior Fauci say ""nothing worry about,"" although stated Americans yet need change behaviors, noted classified COVID-19 outbreak could require change.

Also, Fauci March Anthony Fauci said based modeling current pace coronavirus' spread U.S., ""between 100,000 200,000"" people may die COVID-19, disease caused novel comments CNN's State Union underscore far away U.S. peak outbreak based predictions top federal officials. early Sunday afternoon, 125,000 cases U.S. nearly 2,200 deaths, according data Johns Hopkins University.

I wish unequivocally insisted social distancing wearing masks earlier on, I'm sure lot political pressure, worried mask supply hoarding going on, trying best still lot unknowns. People blaming doctors, clear still denying seriousness things. may want read history mask usage Japan. relatively recent phenomenon strong link disease UK Prime Minister. Hired trainer got diet together.

He also gave country half price McDonald's month demanded people go back office help prop likes pret Greggs.  don‚Äôt anywhere near enough evidence predict people reinfected, know it‚Äôs possible, idea likely is. sorry, can't take seriously repost facebook image

e.g. sweden population 10.23 million 5,860 deaths

that comes to: **573 deaths per million**. bad US (597 deaths per million)

---------

convenient ignore countries took shit seriously since day one wore masks day one close deaths Yep, I've hit well. There's sort automatic filter deletes post certain ""trigger"" words. infuriating, especially given difficult discuss coronavirus US WITHOUT bringing politics. can‚Äôt believe White House made filter. Kudos. POTUS effectively Russian agent, registered. Mitch McConnell Paul Manafort Michael Caputo (currently stepping mental breakdown FB night) many others basically unregistered Russian agents, Russian agent Oleg Deripaska basically Manafort pocket. Manafort chosen go prison rather speak out. think made choice would killed outside prison. trust him, I‚Äôm also fairly confident we‚Äôll vaccine enough production ramped January earliest. somebody sick sure.

But forcing healthy people wear masks dehumanizing. We'll see think see thousands deaths per day. This. people wear masks, new cases COVID go down. really simple. 

We study study figure *why*, let's stick what's working fuckin least. I‚Äôm Upstate NY every single person wears face masks public still It‚Äôs certainly going away quickly thanks Coronavirus poor Spanish people DIE

Yeah. Let's go crazy here. survival fittest. survival biggest.

There plenty same. give us Americans time adapt.. mean, basically invented ‚Äúhealthy size‚Äù nonsense. seen junk food commercials? restaurant portion sizes? 

America stating nature face right now. 

Personally, I‚Äôm little annoyed I‚Äôll likely last one allowed vaccinated took care body via exercise healthy diet. understand people bloated path turned around. 

I think good things come crisis people. Look UK Prime Minister. Hired trainer got diet together. Sorry I'm minority I'm trusting ANYTHING fuckin CDC says on. Considering often they're ""pressured"" saying little donny wants. completely absurd IMO Going logic, Pakistan done alot better USA well. noo, comparison India. Whether something selfish question ethics, question medicine.

You're saying care lockdowns hurt people. also selfish logic. Thank you! superintendent said discussion opening October, school board public forced meeting. school board (all 1) voted loud idiot public open immediately. comments Facebook live feed sickening. superintendent looked extremely disappointed decision. Oklahoma shit show. Prick‚Äôs CIDRAP said nothing positive masks, put ‚ÄúI‚Äôve misunderstood‚Äù post July, nothing positive masks since. university must discussing early retirement. cynical belief dithering outright hostility towards masks veiled racism Asians

i've officially seen dumpster website LOL. joined group becoming dismayed handling pandemic new home country, told news.com.au last week ""disgusted"" Swedish public health Swedish strategy success, failure,"" deadly virus spread hope eventual 'herd immunity' made sense scientifically, given limited knowledge, absolutely made sense ethically.



Of course Aussie expat wants lockdown country. imagination. It‚Äôs there. I'm aware that, reasonably sure late February early March masks could help. evidence caused harm aside speculation shortages, dramatic misuse, misconception putting protective thing face would make less likely take virus seriously.

This supporter recent recordings Trump discussing deadly airborne Feb 7th. suppose could making stuff also guessing think likely briefed.

The problem various national medical leaders know masks could helpful. degree actively advised masks, posited conjecture potential harm. Mask use met derrision. That's harm done public confidence.

Keep mind time South Korea, China, Singapore countries advocating mask use, derided ways hindsight seem vaguely racist.

Similarly time Italy getting slammed, experts proposing lockdowns mask use. almost month warning Italy, mostly due luck yet Canada US spent time poorly, instead clinging idea Italy somehow predisposed hit hard. (It may be, significant way). Instead seems misfortune hit hard first Europe learn many hard lessons us.  Trump herd mentality save Covid Thank you! think forced labor wrong. Even punishment. Nah, meme belongs Obama. 

We make new one called 

Fuck trump. Ask spotify. reason think worth 100s millions. Even fans started turning COVID stance. Sorry, firm policy believing anecdotal information internet.

Wait, plural 'anecdote' data??? Look, like Trump either. misquoting going help cause, going hurt it. Trump's (attempting) say efforts impeach hoax, virus itself. OP deleted comment, can't go back reference, put quotes certainly direct quote. 

I get downvoted hell posting fact check, calling obvious misquote. OP deletes post realizes he's wrong, he's already spread rumor. shit passes Facebook, hate see here.  number trails done ensure tested people variety medical conditions ( say enroll 100 stroke, 100 kidney problems, 100 kind allergy on)

Plus also done batches, safest one given first short people mild conditions given on. Virus sure that, chances might going Fast-track  Ahem, *electrolytes* plants crave. someone shot gun, falls ground dies bleeding out, cause death? Would person died weren‚Äôt shot? Would spontaneously bled without bullet wound? 
 
This revealed CDC. Coronavirus exasperating pre-existing conditions point became deadly. patients COVID, would still alive. Therefore, COVID cause death. not. India from? Atleast live, nobody cares caste person, except they're marrying, like said, caste dominant issue. too. American made N95? can‚Äôt even buy right now. can't fix stupid. future far less important present. here's friendly reminder virus also kill healthy ppl. Yes!! Agree! voids understanding keeping theory


Hi person tenuous grasp evolution theory means biology.

Ima going stop there.

You seem serious misunderstanding word theory means science.

Theories don‚Äôt grow become laws. falsifiable frameworks understanding constructed laws, experimental data theories.

Evolution fact theory.

That evolution occurs along speciation fact.

How occurs theory.

Modern Evolutionary theory referred Neo-Darwinian HOWEVER, also large swaths KNOW FACT, I'm sure Intelligent Designer friends point tend fall ""micro-evolution"" side things. debate that, pointing even though portions question, 


I don‚Äôt IDiot friends actually. friends better versed science quite frankly.

Your desire make untrue statements evolution avoid debate noted whole theory evolution vast all-encompassing concept lot still needs proven make scientific law. like gravity eventually get there.

The theory evolution never become law. theory gravity still theory. didn‚Äôt become law either.

You probably thinking Newton‚Äôs laws motion Newton‚Äôs laws gravitational attraction.

Law means observable causal Laws differ scientific theories posit mechanism explanation phenomena: merely distillations results repeated observation. such, applicability law limited circumstances resembling already observed, law may found false extrapolated. Ohm's law applies linear networks; Newton's law universal gravitation applies weak gravitational fields; early laws aerodynamics, Bernoulli's principle, apply case compressible flow occurs transonic supersonic flight; Hooke's law applies strain elastic limit; Boyle's law applies perfect accuracy ideal gas, etc. laws remain useful, specified conditions apply.


Wiki.


Anyway, brush basic science get back me. Well really respiratory disease, endothelial disease. present lungs cause lot problems there, early data show special representation asthmatics among fatalities. 

That said, already issues breathing ""it's hard breathe"" sickness probably one want give miss. Except known evolutionary pathways easily available online Yes, Sweden continues underestimate masks. Government even *recommend* them!

Here's Sweden‚Äôs top infectious disease expert [Tegnell] video **5 days ago** saying recommend them:

""Any kind review read face masks, everybody agrees [sic!] evidence weak effect. effect, probably big."" Simplified message nitpickers kept missing point over. bet many commenters post ones saying ""mAsKs WoRk!!1!"" 6-7 months ago. US aggressively implemented right stay home pay without risk getting fired symptoms? aggressively implement right (and obligation) parents stay home kids symptoms (+2 days) pay without risk getting fired? way aggressively Sweden doing? mentioned two major differences US Sweden. list alot longer regarding prerequisites handling pandemic. Please provide source claims risking loss. understanding received funding governments order cover costs economic risks. Never worked retail huh? Nope. 15% it‚Äôs time high. pandemic. basically thing everyone using. 

And still dropping. Iif ever wondered there's stereotype stupid American exists worldwide, don't. people like you. shambles heads need roll one apparently gives shite anymore lol. could try reading two seconds state also reported single largest day test results. 5,690 results detected 297 new infections, daily positive rate 5.22%. total number South Dakotans reported disease 17,291. much better forced compliance. Obviously mandatory forced compliance better wearing masks think trying educate non-mask type people wearing mask scientifically proven reduce spread. It‚Äôs crazy types arguments people wearing mask, taking away freedoms one bizarre argument me.

The fact people Japan would wear mask purely common courtesy others amazing thing tbh, something that‚Äôs lacking America. think claim climate-based seasonality hinges ability spend time outdoors. 

Or course people cold places going spread respiratory viruses rapidly. get lot folks clustered indoors area going happen. 

My problem anecdotal selection two places like NYC NY say matches trend, bunch areas match trend, becomes cherry picking. 
Just looking data set pull Sweden see North Temperate country spiking June later instead January.  Picking choosing places saying kind looks right work trying make scientific claims. Somehow many countries need evidence recommend masks case work well. Half Asia Czech republic name top head. stock market recovering, actual economy shambles. Businesses closing droves, gdp down, record unemployment... American way ü•¥ article (regarding 5 year kind time right move Phase One, way licensing, wide-scale manufacturing course we‚Äôve got implementation. We‚Äôve got get people need it,‚Äù added.

So recognizes urgency, every country institution involved, use newest methodologies available (mRNA etc) accelerate case (he also mentions progress mRNA candidates). fact nowhere article say anything people cutting corners quicker 5 years - three phases need observed. article also ancient COVID terms (May) - level progress since Pfizer, Moderna candidates unprecedented phenomenal - world mobilized like never before. 

Also, sure pointing convalescent plasma - FDA one institution one country. Vaccines developed everywhere UK China. everything US. Slim chance get 0.26% death rate virus, Ill take staring 4 walls day. Yes. That‚Äôs made abundantly clear. Take care. Yeah, sympathize. Countries flattened curve different problem: part population thinks lockdown countermeasures much rebelling countermeasures, even they‚Äôre minuscule, labeling authoritarian. It‚Äôs bizarre. Covid _so hard_, people think nothing fucking happening, overrreacted. lied protect China basically saying wasn‚Äôt transmissible people. Total clusterfuck around ‚Äúpreservation supply‚Äù story fig leaf cover poor analysis/reasoning

This needs stated openly lot more. Thanks pointing here. dutch yourself? could explain Lol bye Bill Agreed. Even homebody like me, I'm getting little antsy able go hang freely friends.

On side note, girlfriend Canadian lives Vancouver, hope US Canada come COVID safety protocols extend border crossing family members also long-distance relationships. seen since March =/. dude goddamn hack. Masks help closer thing panacea vaccine is. comment phrased worst way possible nuanced. needs walk back. Dont pics feet jerk to? Instead waste time like that, thats fucking sad. Masks required indoors everywhere, think barber shops opened sure rules... masks sure. Better living house, Ill gladly take chance  Still fuck saying cloth masks might help lot much (since sure) instead sending message masks good idea asymptomatic people. handled fucking poorly. Also I'd rather governments buying distributing masks lying avoid market going crazy. ~~Va bene~~ ok, understood Yes. often massive projects wrap earliest part quarter projected year out? mortgage debt, home. home upon completion debts it, paying monthly. Technically bank still owns it.

So 100% American homeowners mortgage debt. (Unless taken loan paid home, guess.)  think 1 7, 14% mild side-effects fear mongering,

Then wait find 60% tried Oxford vaccine side-effects This. Almost measures fighting COVID-19 dismissed simply Asia (especially mainland China). Masks social distancing proved effective conclusion come expense thousands lives. 

It‚Äôs hard watch lessons learnt hard way different countries, US even different states. many lives could saved‚Ä¶ Well, 239 people died Covid past 24 hours Spain: good that?

That said, Dr Anthony Fauci said don‚Äôt need lock down; need everyone comply public health guidelines: masks worn public, especially indoors; social distance (3 meters); wash hands often thoroughly; avoid crowds, especially crowded indoor spaces; stay home you‚Äôre sick.  dont follow anonymous letter entity internet like bill gates Nah wrong mindset. English speaking west selfish lacks enough empathy continue. Every dog day, gonna get worse death throws. Yep. Nobody wants admit wrong back down. still bonkers seemingly every public health authority world (with exceptions like Sweden, Taiwan, etc.) apparently completely forgot everything know viruses epidemiology medicine COVID opted strategy clearly viable sustainable long term. - nothing due ""wait"" choose time TRUST something distributed? 

says who. gives sense priority &amp; expected timing. says initially emerg basis. indicates working state public health officials implement local free go whenever it‚Äôs available area structured release? 

says free distributed across US. distribution costs also updates plan is?

yes. noted prior one noted working state officials week. even NYC. NYC, like Sweden, seeing low case numbers hit hard spring achieved measure population immunity. 

In contrast, places like CA measures strict NYC, saw spikes summer susceptible population remained uninfected. So, got news coworkers daughter shared daycare classroom another kid tested positive virus today.  


I saw today work shared ladder him, wore mask. 


Should wait get tested? dont wanna test early false negative come in. live New York, I'm well aware many people actually bother wear masks public stay bars restaurants. Even here, people pushing re-open, way, way soon. one takes seriously, even here.

That said, N.Y. kind backslide see states even worse it. Already that. Enjoy virus! love it, kinds headlines considered edgy controversial, yet end day decision sick individual, advice doctor, same: sick symptomatic, stay away others regardless test results. Simple that. Pfizer moderna mRNA.

Pharm.D. think mean 1 mg (milligram). 1g vitamin 40,000,000 IU toxic. 50,000 IU sometimes prescribed week people really low vitamin D.

In opinion take 2000 IU per day maintain summer levels 50 mcg (micro grams). buy year supply $10.  Worth noting Trump admin recently took control CDC reports.

Maybe vaccines available US around 2022. 

If poor, expect become available/affordable 2023. Realistically probably 2024. answer pretty simple - buying Starbucks lunch working home. getting suits cleaned shirts pressed, hitting (outdoor) bar happy coworkers, etc.

It's almost stimulus aimed businesses disrupted lockdown, massive free-for-all... Lol fun giving loved ones virus spring! Que bueno! por eso tienes los derechos de decir estas cosas?  Sabes que estas defendiendo los enemigos de tu comunudad por apoyar mentiras asi, no? Debes crecerte mas. You‚Äôre asshole aim me. responded comment literally used word ‚Äúyou‚Äù. 

Now fuck off. problem! Glad hear helped :) guy could kicked back, enjoyed billions spotlight. Instead wife everything power money improve planet! still ppl hate them!! microchip okey 

You inspiration Bill Indeed! Hope helps slow out-of-control corona train asap. I'd support mandate... *provided* actually based evidence, absolutely *not* popular discourse topic seems be. mandate indoors retail establishment whatever mass gathering anywhere, wear mask, great. start saying idiotic things like ""you always wear mask house, even alone outside,"" absolutely even remotely evidence-based, can't imagine would gain traction. Much discussion topic seems presume mandate would along lines latter, former.

(It's also much open question whether President legal authority make order, four years Trump seeing President actually do, I'm still always shocked find liberals think good idea *further* concentrate power office President.) Wow thanks this. ~$7.50 per respirator that‚Äôs almost 4x cost 3M N95 pre-covid. look nice, might buy some. really think American made selling point wind hot export item due lack counterfeit goods coming USA. lot people China would rather purchase foreign made version product reason luxury infant medical goods categories.  fantastic news falls line thinking. Get front line workers risk vaccinated starting November December rest us after

I wonder plan it‚Äôs available general public. distributed? free go whenever it‚Äôs available area structured release? updates plan is?

I know CDC told states start preparations release info plan currently? interpretation video discourages people wear masks, saying masks work? 

I'm saying video specifically stressing need PPE preserved healthcare workers ""masks work"", ""interpreting"" outright lie. Culture fact thing, cultures different grain salt Sorry anti-russian news site know created lab. 

something like escaping lab different story. Obviously. That's works.  hardly left house aside work groceries six months. can't another year half this. Thank reminder unkind people app. Murcia! Lmfao Wow, Communist country citizens dont rights able control citizens. Anything less 6% victory Biden Trump might still win electoral college. country fucking joke.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, *what*?

I know medical history preexisting lung conditions, mild course preexisting conditions, suggesting practically *definition* overprescribing. data shows interventions limited effect severe diseases -- absolutely supported using mild cases, good reason, would *insane*. Steroids, safe well-understood doctors, still *not* benign drugs, giving everyone prophylatic antibiotics even recommended hospital outside specific subset patients.

This exactly problem doctors complain time patients coming in, thinking know exactly need, expecting drugs fix every problem, getting upset actually need evidence show would actually beneficial.

If want support evidence-based medicine, need *actually listen* evidence showing, jump treatments hear lot about. That's harm people, try avoid much possible.

And also, clear: insurance actually pay $10k bill? exactly zero chance paid $10k X-ray, physical, IV bag. hard us. Europeans second wave now, they're saying shit people saying summer. ""Meh, sure cases going up, where's dead people?"". shocked. Like... thought guys smarter us? ensured complete global retardation. Lmao omg, okay no. 

That claim. can't say well ""most business probably new going fail anyway"" far many variables play make claim. 

Do know that? prove that? making claims. Find business stats. one article even 5 one articles going cut it. call economic trend need see large scale. 

So show stats mass closures new businesses pre post pandemic. That's burden proof.

Edit: would also need adjust numbers recession order prove trend. really sad. good college kids serious education, affected bad college kids want party. casual, disrespectful college kids ruining experience serious, studious college kids. would possible smart kids college dumb kids obnoxious.

Kids think college parties need sent home. College parties. getting education. can't appreciate magnitude advantage going college national crisis, belong there. matter nice words admissions essay, kind test scores got SAT. even matter got letter recommendation teacher coach. prepared knuckle concentrate studies, belong campus.

Kids party national crisis destroying educational opportunities smart kids want learn. Shame them, belong college, take away financial aid send home. USA far cases deaths  Trump built wall Mexico, affect Mexico's trade rest North America. economic policies affect trade physical wall lol. He's still office, could still WIN ELECTION. trump said never downplayed it?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I mean saying playing it...twice.

I honestly can't understand anyone vote absolutely blatant lying, hey... Mask = Pro Biz 

Mask = Anti Biz Article: *minor side effects, common ones vaccines*

This sub: *ZOMBIES WORLD WAR Z VACCINE EVER LEAST FAUCI TELLS ME* Wow dude Maybe due way changed behavior washing hands, social distancing, wearing masks flu less likely spread. 



But think it‚Äôs foolish think happened Southern Hemisphere happen here. That's easier said done. Countries uniform population density. US NYC arctic circle Alaska. could keep dividing countries subdivisions. Even states diverse. still people commuting one county city another.

You aware effect population density, easy way measure deaths population density. dystopian preventative measures protect public health? Maybe meant say ""inconvenient"" something. Fuck Donald Trump stuck head since started *Over past couple months

That doesnt mean caught due practices playing. Lmao bf quote shit daily. time favorite ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna numbers double one ship wasn‚Äôt even fault‚Äù (in reference one cruises infections didn‚Äôt want let dock US). Runners include ‚Äúit‚Äôs going up‚Äù ‚Äúairtight pretty close airtight‚Äù lot more, Donnie wants keep ignoring neglecting stays retweet white power videos go golfing pandemic. shocking response.

No doubt continue spew dangerous rhetoric though. Anything fits narrative owns libs huh? understand case many hispanic households, there‚Äôs nothing wrong that. issue comes comparison sardines, belittling. original comment overall came ignorant offensive me, hispanic. bothering long! 'Media' problem? 'The media blowing proportion' 'The media exaggerating it' BRUH! think stats come from? MEDIA?!? Infection numbers rates Departments Health CDC. hospitalizations hospitals CDC. deaths hospitals CDC. point 'The media' come fluff numbers??? would done better federal government stepped believe, problems society limited government. 

America perfect powder keg virus take hold, last pandemic, even last coronavirus really need honest start tackling fundamental problems hands. good time flu shot, wait October? sure current flu shot offered ""updated"" version. assume is, heard somewhere often changes September figure actual strain? completely wrong here? posting week-old article?  Curious, collecting fact checking deaths imagine come thousands hospitals standards record keeping NAC. Drink water. Go outside stand sun. Monday 200,000 dead Americans. Clickbait, fearmongering, shit article. Next. Yes is. Kids dimwitted see way sent home. OP? lol dude care. also acknowledging Vermont outlier terms government run something politically engaged people would into. know another state left-wing independent senator, centrist dem senator, republican governor, progressive lt governor? see that's quirky? lmao people don‚Äôt get it, don‚Äôt worry poster 100% rational lol, that's 'no'. Sounds right. Germinal center loss unique severe infectious diseases, unlikely occur vaccination vaccines designed efficiently induce germinal centers. Therefore, believe vaccination may best way generate robust effective herd immunity. 

In short, developing herd immunity naturally difficult body's reaction high viral loads derails process, vaccines provoke minor response could see greater effectiveness.

Great news vaccines, great news already infected hoping get free pass social distancing think immune. Still short sighted. nothing wrong wearing masks public buildings especially offices. think violates right klapmongool. countries USSR communist countries? He's Trumpflake reality difficult understand. It‚Äôs safe follow fucking guidelines laid deciding you‚Äôre done weather getting warm. People US understand body fucking works apparently. shit frustrating, that's perspective healthcare worker well could literally die virus due health complications. where? Got chuckle one. Worth pointing though 40k deaths, catching car substantially less. Okay... ""Most"" mom pop shops, makes okay!

Gee thanks Mister, head far ass yours, I'd able live Real world too! problem though people still aren‚Äôt using masks think government lying numbers use case original lie justify beliefs. thing misguided was, understand original lie came about. people don‚Äôt want stretch critical thinking far. It‚Äôs easier believe everything lie. figured would case made sure get glasses renewed months ago especially hearing gets eyes infection worse. Figured would provide protection &amp; do!  countries like China. remember SARS released population via lab accidents Beijing, twice, right?

[NIH - Breaches safety regulations probable cause recent SARS outbreak, Journal - Second Lab Accident Fuels Fears Honestly I‚Äôd hefty fine first time, house arrest second offense. Maybe one week house arrest first time. Man, vaccine timelines place. I've seen reference seasonal spike chart before, guy pleasant job trying match information charts, bit stretch. 

Folks keep touting one paper, patterns covid spread line trends shown paper. 

That dude goes select Brazil's numbers (a country size US) says falls within regional pattern. 

Yes, viruses like covid flu prevalent different seasons, especially winter. Everyone inside sharing air space potentially exposed. NY happens match figure time frame virus hit NY spread learned enough stem spread. 

If got conclusive data showing latitudes virus trends, directly match folks saying, I'd like see it. video everything else I've seen says look general shapes randomly selected places claim matches, even really comparing apples apples. creator video even address latitudes generally speaks ""regions"" paper says all! Ok . post history says you‚Äôre teenager. absolute clue Yes I‚Äôm saying need lockdown longer you‚Äôd like hardships government need deal help people. Masks totally stop droplets, that‚Äôs basic mechanics life. 

But seems introduction masks absolutely zero actual spread virus population. Take look literally graph put mandatory masks see happens. Nothing. Nothing happens. 

Here best example this. UK reopened pubs without mandatory masks, guess happened millions people started interacting small spaces. Nothing happened. crappier material paper lol non woven fabric material used items (as stated) currently companies turning paper alternative. Look Terraboost wipes, they're junk available. nuke reddit history regularly keep going back continuing argue idiots, wish kept track posts people trying tell Italy's numbers high terrible healthcare system, US problem ""the best world"" lie unnecessary. general public directed MAKING cloth masks everyday items sewing tools (and many households do) neighbors. worked Europe btw. Could link significant proof peer-reviewed sources then?  Restaraunt, bar, movie theater, concert, museum? article heavily discussed released two weeks ago. little stale repost today, Indian resident dies COVID-19 every 76 seconds, still getting faster. ? not? assumes 100% excess deaths caused someone catching dying covid. lockdowns excess death toll own. Understandably so. experience, oldest vulnerable people know already giving caring. watch 80+ plus neighbors continue family gatherings. oldest members family starting care. live side country given travel safety get together carry life normal. almost feels taking seriously becoming punishment extremely low risk. 

Once front line workers get vaccine, think going US caring. never fix climate change. even close. confidence find new ways earning money assembly.   He'll jobs today exist 20 years ago.  find new things place value effort assembly robots take over. Yeah insurance. insurers pay bill eventually recoup costs. skeptical 10-20% claims No. Asa Hutchinson said new number ""frustrating"" throws state's daily numbers, accurately show virus spreading concerned every death, see [death rate] accelerating, we're accounting deaths happened previously,"" Hutchinson said. opened Pandora's box long ago many fields. Trying put spirit back bottle work. Oh damn, that‚Äôs disappointing. 

That‚Äôs worse Travis Scott McDonald‚Äôs meal see ad every day now. Target demographic risk bad outcome... think meant say ""herd mentality"" ... /s Lol nice deflection. Peak r/coronavirus lmao. rest comment?  proving point. Rumors Season 4 coming December early 2021. Haha, gotta think Walmart shopper overlaps anti-masked quite bit Venn diagram. tend shoot foot. Lol nice citation! google it! Peak r/coronavirus lmao. statistics anecdotes. Keep hiding nothing. Maybe 2022 get back ‚Äúaspirations‚ÄùüòÇ least use google translate. really think listening me.

I assure read every word wrote. I'm talking abstractly saving every life can. things mentioned, would save lives. That's fact. banned cars, would save tens thousands lives year, regardless whether contagious. understand that? 

Yes, do. Covid head. 

What sub again? speaking balance lives VS. freedom government policies. could save millions lives banning certain things. want that? 

You oversimplifying things ridiculous extent. discussion balance ""lives vs freedom"" legitimate, scope sub COVID right? 

The reason asked question differences fundamental. strike different balance lives freedom depending risk talking about. 

You different things save lives would lost due covid would to, say, painting house lead based paint fundamentally different things therefore require fundamentally different actions strike balance. Sadly agree. People taking logic saying fuck it. pretty rare survive Chinese education system vision intact. trying get decent university like 10+ hours reading per day 12 years life. Everyone know school worn glasses sooner later.  definitely increase least. Even 1/10 people consider option future that's still pretty decent change. huffpost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Pretty cool first 200 thousandth victim U.S. don‚Äôt one jobs. don‚Äôt come work, free money don‚Äôt Good. Deal virus like dealt literally every virus pandemic modern history. assuming stayed resort? Bet blow mind. speak Spanish fluently degree native born Spanish speaker. 

When make assumptions make ass yourself. nations take Canadian option.  certainly create shock resentment factor sight unobstructed face aligns puritinacalism. 

I've never experienced shock resentment all. Even whole thing. always been.. ok.. prefer wear mask, that's business. 

I think reasons matter reasonable something proper reason thing would stupid different reason. That's exactly mask requirements global. say wear times, need wear able keep distance. people Asian countries shamed wearing masks?

I honestly know. Nuclear fallout doesn‚Äôt .6% mortality rate similar antibody fragment UCSF reported month ago. 

Its pretty easy manufacture, they're long way away even getting people - maybe 2-3 months basic Tox work, scaling manufacturing Ph1/2/3. You‚Äôre welcome, actually think virus eradicated there‚Äôs hope anyways. kind (and will, hopefully) stay inside forever rest us enjoy 1 life have. getting vaccine? Yeah, disabled five years. adjust little person contact. pandemic issue watching wife adjust difficult. flip side issue meet someone know someone disabilities limit mobility try go extra mile get house visit them. Really makes difference. People already griped kids much screen time. it‚Äôs forced them. There‚Äôs probably reversing damage point. lot Gen Z prefer remote work human interaction grew device. world want live in. individual level, effectiveness simple masks quite limited, however, reducing chance transmission little bit everyone huge impact spread population. surprising. shift - lots kids parents do, like Asia. need somehow gain gd empathy! helps, Fauci says typically get mid late October: 

 rest planet minus us brazil NY counties border VT. still refuse aother lock-down. Link that? Proof? Well heard lot people start D- criticizing calling racist etc trying shut borders. Damned damned don't. want keep vitamin summer levels take 2000 IU day. low doctor might prescribe 50,000 IU week. Almost certainly depends type society instituting in. mostly wealthy country, country government able enforce lockdowns authoritarian level, sure, work fine. country social distancing, quarantining, working-from-home practically impossible (i.e. people would starve), government can't simply physically force it, no, much.

This true since Day One surprise one. much conversation best government response based peoples' personal situations (can work home still put food table? big back yard and/or local hiking trails relax on? biggest regret Year COVID fact vacation Paris got cancelled kids annoying school hours?). complete lack able put oneself another's shoes, terminal condition modern world.  Yet almost twice many deaths per capita lockdown masks Sweden also excess deaths accounted for, excuse However, masks also [deadly Hah. say would force everyone - I'm going wear mine. Cool, thankfully opinion means nothing. You‚Äôre stupid. See call anything want also. Hard picture everyone wearing mask. That‚Äôd great. It‚Äôs case live. think half brain comment based amount knowledge speed information obtained today, spend tiny bit time looking it. also good historic information 1918 pandemic many people bother look at.

We started wearing masks back Feb/March, why?

First off, human institutions (WHO CDC) good running them. CDC specifically issues current US administration basically put fork it. take time CDC recover damage caused administration.

Next, internet allows one see much detail countries people within reacting certain events, like covid. two institutions downplaying masks watching countries masking up.

Additionally, covid spreading extremely quick easily, appeared physical contact virus.

Finally, already number studies data various materials masks. debate around effective things like cloth mask were, results showed effect. many cases amount virus exposed important, even cloth mask help that.

 logical wear mask reduce exposure, little much might be. Great Depression? like **BEST** Depression, amirite?

^^^:( government faith people something proud of. always stockpiles PPE hand anyway  proposal: rename sub r/maskfetish make another one, mask fetish material would banned things actual interest discussed. talk Donald way. ~~What 20+ years fighting malaria/polio Africa Asia eventually made wild polio go extinct Africa?~~

Nah fuck no, hundreds thousands scientists report Gates Gates foundation absolutely knowledge virology immunology, thus makes Bill Gates, irrelevant /s Sure - remember mom watching thing Oprah way back when. Plus I've read many stories people shitting changing rooms.

But I'm sick I'm going wear mask anyone saying something shove it. too...its EU vaccines I'm concerned with. I‚Äôll make comment cute puppy get back really want to. üòÇüëç

I see shaping fall winter next year America already comments done social distancing masks. Covid 19 loves fools talk shit. 

The rest sane scientific world see asses rear view mirror. Looks like good way civilization collapse. giving away China, Russia EU keep flat earth thinking. Yeah, Facebook ads driven whatever entity buying them, like election interference Cambridge Analytica. there's Russian disinformation groups actively push extremes argument sow discord doubt, abusing algorithm ads likely get engagement Glad better protection, upset n95 better most. dental hygenist nurses mask. Yeah studies said last weeks. Minus viral load= higher probabilities less severe problems Came say Good you. It‚Äôs step need take business operators - require masks retail professional person meetings. can‚Äôt negotiable item. never heard before. flu vaccine effective them? don‚Äôt want rude again, can‚Äôt expect society keep things people overweight. Maybe need figure effective everyone every weight.  experts, including Fauci, saying masks useless point wearing them, research found fact useful. research early quickly determined even though covid droplits small mask filter still attach larger particles mask filter. 

This way back March I've wearing mask ever since. Getting lied government top health officials left bad taste mouth. 100% accurate.  Get daily dose around 5000 iU Vitamin sun stops shining, super cheap risk pop Frontline workers getting first huge step slowing spread easing medical system Maybe COVID deemed ""over"" back normal (whether means completely eliminated manageable) everyone chill maybe weeks month? Like let's agree nice possible relax bit, like vacation. Though would politicized I'm sure.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Plus people become complacent deaths hospitalizations went down. hope I'm wrong, think real tests going mid December mid-January.

With everyone indoors, I'm sure we'll still people insisting traditional Thanksgiving Christmas.  there's second wave, spread it. Plus college students coming home holiday breaks.

If make past then, we'll ok, drop guard mid late January. De Blasio Trump pushing employers NYC open offices economic reasons. Meanwhile, lot work done remotely. point, give late January see things are? 


IMO, make sense push returning office right cold flu season kick in. social media algorithms propel shit people, honestly responsible me. Watch Social Dilemma. Wisconsin quarantine list? recent credible projections? 400,000 year end? enough population vaccinated even level effectiveness still reach threshold herd immunity. 

Any vaccine going roll instantly. take several months administer even they've preemptively producing it. trivial logistics problem.

The return normal also going instant. things return normal time people vaccinated risk outbreak slowly fades. adds weight argument released/escaped lab, necessarily created there.

Otherwise need believe mutation naturally occurred city, miles lab performed research type virus bats, called poor containment practices past, performed controversial ""gain function"" research viruses, country lab accidents happened similar viruses twice before, lab destroyed samples investigation could start.

To date nobody able find origin virus outside Wuhan afaik.

I see evidence virus genetically manipulated speculative far, see preponderance evidence virus accidentally released lab fact covered up. worst thing happened N95 respirators fucking Jared shitstain Kushner playing ""monopoly tabletop game"" seized medical cargo allowing go going.

I still think recommending cloth masks would better, even considering amount fiddling them, exposed noses, etc. Net gain. reading one reasons spreading well SARS 2000's pretty much hit fast hard, covid lingering, slow acting, takes lot time allow spread killing you.  biggest issue we're facing Canada basically one gets trouble breaking COVID regulations. worst could happen maybe asked politely exit store? course cases skyrocketing, even cold weather really set in. there's zero consequences. understanding was, one really underestimated masks.

Everyone vastly overestimated likelihood ""we'll figure something else works better"" richest technologically advanced nation earth. *last* deaths. instead one worst hit countries. Maybe countries bit worse look numbers nothing else, nearly resources US does. US fucking global super power, zero excuse badly. response worst, bad, extra bad country like US. dum-dums better vision?

This isn‚Äôt video game get 5 attribute points pick brains eyesight. called science precedent. fastest vaccine history took five years. Plus toxicity new drugs tested prove fatal

So suddenly getting vaccine virus less year right election. Yeah right. Let's forget FDA walk back comments plasma month ago. okay that. fact even vaccine 1 year pandemic started pretty remarkable. expect nothing 2022 then. never claimed one decides shut certainly form opinion based data. opinion, effects lockdowns worse virus, future. ripple effects lockdown felt decades come. Restrictive measures covid limited mask mandates restrictions large gatherings, concerts. Schools, universities, businesses open hosting normal functions, albeit restricted way. passed death toll almost like uncontrolled pandemic going right? expert remember reading data years ago suggesting non-Caucasian ethnicities harder time overcoming respiratory infections likes, even things like wealth, access healthcare, factors controlled for. Surge hospitalizations says nothing total number visits people going ER heart attacks, stroke, etc. fear catching covid.  ‚ÄúOfficially‚Äù, unofficially passed number long time ago. took I'm worried #winning time, data home made masks even basic paper masks would effective are. Everyone *knew* ""good"" masks would help, lied. lied faces third country convinced 2/3 sheep.

Turns simple piece double layer fabric plenty effective stopping fast transmission, combined minimizing social contact stop spread quite effectively. That's pretty rich michael osterholm, went Joe Rogan March 10th said there's nothing do, ""it's like trying stop wind"" masks work, even medical personnell. role administration part reason declared defeat even started. Well, well, well, much ‚Äúwe need hurry open economy‚Äú ‚Äúwe need bail businesses‚Äù. Consumer spending drives economy. people : Don‚Äôt money spend - don‚Äôt spend it, don‚Äôt feel safe visiting business, don‚Äôt go there. lack foresight brought upon us exactly foolishly rushed avoid. anti mask, covid hoax people obtuse, person dying RIGHT front them...and go ""meh...fake"" Recall, president United States knew airborne capable person-to-person transmission late January... told Bob Woodward much early February. turned around told public worry it, fact, phone China January clearly freaking out. This. much this. 

It fucking obvious anyone paying attention beginning. right, entire country not. state, however, closed almost everything March May told two weeks entire time.

Than began reopening laundry list Vaccine business can't open.

This sustainable 2021. people able pay rent since March. toilet paper hoarding evidence enough think gets pass relatively quickly corrected course admitted made call order balance risks. I'm sure acknowledged mistake hindsight, consistent since. Belgium reports much bigger way countries. addition confirmed COVID-19 deaths hospitals, figures also include suspected deaths patients showed symptoms weren‚Äôt actually tested, well deaths outside hospitals: home nursing homes long-term care centers. fact, deaths account around half Belgium‚Äôs total count.

So want get even ground US numbers, need divide 856 death per million 2, equals 428 deaths per million 179 death per million fewer US.

Next time bring math statistics, remember get bottom data. almost like huge motorcycle rally middle pandemic bad idea.  US do... find hard believe affect numbers. Doctors rarely see flu deaths. IIRC, it‚Äôs often detected post-mortem tests. US, states year take part testing program numbers feed yearly flu estimate. hundred thousand people year flu listed death certificates. rest extrapolating test data 50 states assuming certain percentage deaths pneumonia diseases caused part flu. Kinda funny conspiracy theorists never point flu death number based way assumptions covid number. 

Great article issue. vaccines way, get fast possible.

No, important major shareholder companies. *sad trombone* I‚Äôve seen rct meta study showed real effectiveness influenza. ones advocating masks observational. think that‚Äôs good enough it‚Äôs really hard study this, exist. one click refund Uh, yeah. Look everyone agreeing you. dehumanize people non-pandemic times

Oh God. better visit Asia, Japan places... they're animals tell ya. mask wearing time... sheesh, they're animals.   Start process year ago. need ask leave, public enforce rule. people shouldn‚Äôt allowed reproduce Depends live. state virus control seeing increasing hospitalizations, basically Implement form restrictions don‚Äôt know outbreak crest respect healthcare system. We‚Äôve seen pattern over. state that‚Äôs problem, states opening measuring impact. Honestly, probably feel bad thinking source adequate dismiss consensus opinion experts.

I would ashamed best evidence offer. post initial comment hoping you‚Äôd get wish violence people? awfully quick escalate calling 911 someone physically attacked"
