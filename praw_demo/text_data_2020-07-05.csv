0,2020-07-05," Lots potential reasons. 

Perhaps Brazilians positive tests go seek health care, health care followup, Balkanized statistics reporting system, like US, counties states systems, 3rd parties collate media, national institutions lag weeks months...

Perhaps vitamin deficient.

And perhaps less obesity.

My suspicion Brazil, positive test means one likely seek health care, whereas US, soldier symptomatic Covid-19 symptoms become severe, knowing hospitalization costs could bankrupt us. Brazil would record recovered cases, many milder cases US never resolved records. first amendment right freedom religion, speech, press, petition, assembly... wanna go beach suck COVID air fellow dipshits, guest. would assume everything, dont talk things  People supported Romneycare. Obamacare based *more* friendly corporations Romney's iteration.

Which probably passed. Chinese guy, I'm surprised Brits Lancet Richard Horton, China publishes almost every paper it.

And UK listen them? worth Coronavirus-free rotisserie chicken! notice lot situations people wait see wearing mask put thier own. steady increase mask use testing probably causing result? East side state, seems common thing particular provider I'm reading. signs symptoms COVID-19 must cross border work non-discretionary purposes, may continue so. examples non-discretionary travel purposes are:  work study  critical infrastructure support  economic services supply chains  health, immediate medical care, safety security

Without them, lot kids either going turn monsters worse. ""Influencers.."" \*Shudders\* hes saying someone died pneumonia caused covid 19 counted pneumonia death, covid death, both. many jobs average person take lifetime? cruise liners absolutely step pay workers, workers definitely right leave cruise liners rot. RemindMe! 2 weeks wave 2 Try meditation. really helps, say experience. Add ambient sounds(with(out) instrumental music per tastes). I’m server bartender refused go back work first lockdown. People made fun said dramatic. friends said taking seriously refused meet lunch. I’m ‘ told type ’ know good family. asthmatic pneumonia 2 times young adult life. Fuck virus fuck numbers. better, must better. Lmao human stupidity really knows bounds. lockdown, masks, contact tracing. Look you’re desperate get coronavirus go get it. don’t expect hospital bed waiting need one. H1N1 likely much problem. We're already going partial immunity H1 envelope protein virus. 1918 H1N1 became seasonal influenza 1957. also H1N1 disappeared 1957 2009 old people contracted influenza 1957 partial immunity H1 protein 2009 H1N1 virus. Even though spent 52 years mutating pigs result triple reassortment N1 protein actually entirely zoonotic origin. old T-cells pre-1957 H1N1 still good enough make pandemic nothing like one.

The H1N1 pigs right similarly unlikely cause issues like this.

H5N1 different story. probably look like 1918 hops birds people somehow. Nobody immunity H5 protein. thing makes Homie feel better homieself, Homie never get tired it. Homie never happy. prior SARS infections Japan may produced immunities, Japan much likely mask up, Japan set network testing services 50s due tuberculosis, Japanese far better leadership population listens obeys. We've got Trump loyalists. won’t fill up? idk tell you

NYC got hit harder nearly anywhere Earth besides Italy didn’t ever deny care anyone needed it, field hospitals went unused, etc.

you’re naive think anywhere U.S. population density lack healthcare facilities bad NYC day-return business trip would already legal reason cross Canada, require Canadian license plate. EBD rate close 50%. Covid what? 0.5%?

Been since I’ve school 100% increase likelihood death? Damn. He’s gon bring shit back. Diiiiip!

I got bitched today parents avoided sisters kids came 3 days....less 24 hours spending 3 days river packed.

They said “it doesn’t matter. mad sister them” said am, wasn’t mean them. said they’re kids don’t need avoid them. like uhhh....are stupid? bring back easy adults? 

They said I’m gunna avoid kids rent hotel visit....I’m literally forced parents interact kids go river every weekend cause don’t want feelings hurt.

My dads cancelled like 4 river trips 2 beach trips covid. fighting cancer 5 years, smoked 50 years. there’s person 100% chance dying get rona, it’s probably him. doesn’t give shit.

They think immune something. used say it’s state. “not like New York” it’s blowing massively (so cal) it’s “good thing aren’t LA county”

Now I’ve got couple friend friends symptoms it’s “good thing haven’t seen months”

It’s matter time it’s “I wish listened you” instead “not meeee”. there’s fucking thing convince sister gunna fuck us. 

The sister “moved out” March dad fly Maine family death, “scared” he’d bring back. 

Fuck I’m irritated. Well hope so. Yup. last paragraph: want tap endowments, could always lower overhead getting rid inexcusable horrendous bloat happened name now-cancelled ""premium on-campus experience"" really much great teachers teaching valuable skills making college feel like 4 years disneyland everyone else gets - missing get it, too. judge! judge said this! Proof y'all, matter educated are, human still human! can't think variables? Two things true once.

MI mishandled crisis beginning hit NE really bad. NY mishandled well. anyone claiming, ""we known,"" bologne. saw Italy, Spain, Wuhan.

But, specidically citing happened since moment. Since moment reopen states spiralled control, states discipline succeeded.

This flattening curve I'm starting hate fucking phrase. goal health. best way achieve health case load small EVERY case isolated, contacts traced. safely reopen everything trust moment rears head it'll stopped. plan theoretical occurring China, Korea, Germany.

It happening believe super soldiers powerful science. dying like idiots.  reading this, seems Canada ambiguous handling COVID-19 testing data. That's unnerving hear reading Germany/New Zealand/Canada/South Korea, sounds like everyone going back normal except us.... mall induces motion sickness yell something makes true.... /s like donald trump? I'd imagine applying unemployment due fired covid-19, write statement telephone call verify. Since longer working there, employer probably report fired pay unemployment. paid solely state, opportunity explain situation. RIP man. following progress ever since beginning... handsome fit man. think I'd reading this... seemed like making great strides.

People... late start safer wearing masks distancing on... better say ""I wrong now"" end grave want change ways. kill elderly. overweight. immunocompromised. anything. indiscriminate. also saw median age people tested drop 65 35. That's big deal would explain lot. Annnnnnd people STILL stay home, social distance, wear mask. tragic. also confirm this. I’m UW alum, frat, girls living us house summer paying rent. what?? flu vaccine notoriously ineffective due nature virus it’s rapid mutation. I’m trying directly argue you. Testing important. it’s easy. It’s unlikely city gonna unlimited tests even entire nation dealing this. prevalence community low, test whoever, cases increase, supplies decrease, id rather accurately track positivity rate structured testing algorithm, try test everyone, especially negative test results give false sense security people. development testing highly doubt that. mom everything right far quarantining slipped one coworkers shared space work. Imagine people even care it. easily spike roof 2 weeks. Again- general reporting one health agencies.

The point top thread outcome widely tracked reported deaths (and cases hospitalizations/ventilator use).  one studies this.

We know tons studies Covid causing sorts long term impacts. None show data portals used report Covid statistics. There’s “a lot” footage Nick. He’s celebrity, he’s Broadway actor occasionally got gigs TV episodes. It’s like vast wealth Tonight Show interviews Behind Scenes features record real person. Clips playing policeman Blue Bloods going console child real memories father. anything, they’ll hurt perception real person versus characters played. base believes everything says... could sell maga masks millions. OK - 1/3 Americans quickly find absent opportunity education employment - schools employers locking refuse vaccine - they'll either get program beat thing enjoy working meth gangs. Same. sense personal wellbeing lockdown greatly exceeded recent past. old gym, couldn’t even Re-rack weights gym never enforced that; they’re going follow rules either. Cases hospitalizations rising exponentially, *what happens inevitably fill up*?

Why avoiding question much? Tech guy here. traveling nurses, extensive interviewing process get next gig? would hiring hospital know nurse good? island nation closed borders.  That's easy mode.

Hawaii PR pretty control- guess what, open they'll starve financials. believe USA already said make affordable everyone I'm looking June 13. trend shifted, reaching two-week high. June 20, reached another peak 16 days ago.

I'm expecting least another push around 600 deaths per day, hopefully downchannel continues instead breaking. really wanted recover, nothing else wife deserved that, fought every bit hard try get through. I’m sorry little boy too, can’t imagine pain knowing kids would never know daddy, it’s completely devastating unfair. Covid sucks. second this!!! Especially second third week. came back strong felt better. Crazy dizziness, headache, breathe, terrible chest pain, o2 dropped 80s. came went mid March may me. Stay top, get checked clots. Breathing difficulty complication kill clots real danger. Know signs stroke cardiac problems starting get checked lots. Stay safe everyone. Everytime see news Covid America see hospitals rake money. going postulate, would gamble modern diet caged domestication last 100 years would six genes 60,000 years ago. mean could handled better get benefit doubt first get hit.

Southern states watched NYC got brunt it. could stockpiling PPE building robust contact tracing programs.

Instead done fuckall blaming bullshit. also whining ""unfair"" medical personnel southern states bear brunt governors continue fuckall. No. Cut bars/ in-door dining, places spread. 

Covid-19 stop 10pm 6am silly. Saving people would encouraging people social distance wear masks. leaders Germany Japan managed minimize loss life economic catastrophe implementing strict contact tracing.

Trump went direction, decided let 120k (and counting) Americans die hopes economy crater he'd secure re-election. knows many people would died gave half shit lives. Nice. fun getting elderly family members quite possibly sick. Incredibly selfish. great news. 100 million great, would even better. wonder would take produce eight billion doses. wonder plants could produce additional doses. Mucinex great actually slight improvement Yakima tbf. consistently getting 200 cases day long ago. mask mandate looks working. thought Alaska so-called ""Marine Highway"" Washington state pass Canadian soil? Yes, surprising. back fat protected virus, Americans would slaying thing sure. Well idea even cases even 1% country immune. found true immunity became ton infections like new research says potential narrative would shift ""this virus feels never ending vaccine"" ""hey, lot us caught already maybe virus much weaker think""

But made comment thought testing T-Cells (which experts think would reveal true immunity number). I'm expecting small number really hope vaccines free bc wtf. fear wont though see high costs. still bad. remember 1000 cases one day considered lot here. common cold got media coverage coronavirus painted light yes think people would barging doors chance worth taking. Especially COVID damages organs.

Them see infection rates shouldnt we? saw sharp decline locked sharp increased whem opened. try dwell state things days watch news think fucked. best decent human fellow man. Oooooh... damn. fair. Oh shut fuck up.  wife's hospital Colorado achieved weeks ago stayed way. area served covid nearly 1/2 million people (her hospital taking covid patients banner tri-city area) said everything shouldn’t open. masks work outdoor transmission limited, can’t outdoor activity bans lifted? can’t wear masks inside? don’t understand people can’t see hypocrisy would willingly surrender basic human rights virus unlikely harm you’re healthy 70.  There’s also massive financial incentive first vaccine this. That’s shit load money pumped companies pockets Bucks, Kings, whose next? I'm taking vaccine standard amount time thoroughly treated &amp; proven safe. 

Everyone else volunteer quick &amp; rushed vaccine. meant April 2021

/s starters, mine. careers tech require college degree aside says listing. second, dismissing trades insane considering many high value trade jobs are.

Off shore workers, example, get paid post grad college students ever make.

I'm nto sure point trying make metric shitton positions truly require degree kind. Oh trump philosophy. test it, exist. exactly bragging point.

However, Brazil would excellent place surveys lingering disorders/disability symptomatic Covid-19. Ugh sucks really rooting him. put hell fight. vaccines already tens thousands trials, concerns nothing worry about. Even one make out, others will. He’s influential member state legislature. Rest assured administration hospital he’s admitted make damn sure care prioritized. haha funny ;) seriously, cannot life understand people freak COVID infectious diseases dismiss vitamin (at minimum). 

It's almost like y'all want everyone sick. course. makes feel better wearing masks carrying life usual. locked city? We're here! We're dipshits! Get used it! AKA Skeletor live end seven miles windy dirt road, also popular campers. (National forest, we've got tiny patch private land middle it.) 

Legally, speed limit road 25. Realistically, locals travel 30-35 safely. 

I cannot tell many times I've hurry get somewhere, dipshit city pulling camper 5-10mph, obviously looking camp site ... middle road can't pass them, miles. honk, usually flip off. stuck six seven miles, eating dust. 

So. Many. Times.

It's major holiday weekend reduced testing, various locations reporting (Los Angeles), least 3 States actively suppressing numbers. Next week going brutal. I've found filtering bit heavy too, mean kind elephant room, one main drivers increase cases, politicized someone particular. supposed pretend that's case? All-cause mortality deaths region. normally Florida 10,000 people per month die, 2020 12,000 people per month die, assume covid death count 2000 people per month, since nothing else appreciably changed. made edit. DNC already canceled activities told delegates stay home. Sorry doesn’t fit narrative . Oh past time. Half-assing response exactly got hit economic downturn virus time.

If masks enforced first lockdown (and people respected it), we'd track reopening now. See Massachusetts's success story.

America it, we're willing respond appropriately crisis. I’ve side gun control, I’m starting see people feel need protect themselves. pre-existing conditions that's asking. 


Does really matter? wife fucking 1 year old that's fatherless. can't even rally fight enemy virus. makes think rally fight alien invasion? We'll still people screaming fake news think aliens invaders great market iPhones fast food. Yup think 24 years since learn elementary school. Somehow still know words tune. Since diagnosed thought pneumonia late March, Canadian actor spent weeks intensive care Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Los Angeles, right leg amputated, lost 60 pounds hoping receive double-lung transplant.

Just fucking flu, eh? Lol noticed yours. Russia’s since beginning  Yeah think hospitals have?  Yes also consider many people would normally go hospital things like heart attacks, strokes, etc. go COVID overcrowded hospitals. 

Not discrediting fact COVID deaths counted correctly, consider deaths happened result coronavirus (but necessarily COVID-19 positive cases). That's symptom, comorbidity. incredible news. However, important make sure antibodies work get something like exposed virus. Still, fantastic news. really win win! Kiddo SpongeBob one right one Gramma embroidered Eevee. There's much room self expression. Also, first time since kiddo started preschool four years ago I've gone month without getting sick. could get used living germ factory, lol. change Unlucky vote someone stupid Ontario least one thing alright. things like dismantling windmills already partially constructed payed for. cost $231 million dollars scrap/cancel contracts windmill projects. Im saying really enforce it, Florida hundreds miles beaches. ones many people enforced I'm buddy, guy.  real. friend CA posted today 2yr old bunch friends going right past “beach closed” sign. Tons people beach. closed nobody enforcing it?! agree everything said except still slaveholders dollar bills

While factually true, also like erases significant contributions defeating oppressive imperialistic monarchy creation system government allowed progress made time since.

I'm sure heard lot, also removes context time. Historical figures praised better acts recognized serious shortcomings.

In 100 years, everyone finally wised fact maybe genociding torturing animals pleasure bad thing, also withhold praise non-vegan historical figure? like facts people know better now. cant test potential cases isolate positives never slow thing without lockdown. There's nothing get. simply follow lead cult leader. lot independent thought taking place fair, several broad-range antiviral treatments work well mitigating harm could effective novel viruses. none developed work 'acute' disease type associated COVID-19. Essentially type disease involves rapid proliferation virus body trump pretty much antiviral treatment nature antiviral meant do. best results 'somewhat effective' except prophylactic use dealing massive exponential growth.

So wrong saying totally surprising preexisting drugs work well treating COVID-19, definitely situations preexisting treatments could work well novel pathogen. America, amusement parks opening! Fucking stupid morons. local govt pushes responsibility individual. failure leadership set blame people. Last heard actually cardiovascular attacking virus. Lung issues symptom. already \~4 weeks since rise infections.

So two weeks passed. People want think COVID could kill someone fairly young healthy. Could’ve fooled too. online forestry school classroom? I've looking different schools lately I've thought switching careers forestry fisheries want distance learning it. said goodbye decade+ long career couple years ago kinda wandering. Torontonian here, thank can't wait welcome over! COVID leaving young old folks alike crippled. hospitals Texas starting get overran. maybe two weeks hospitals get real bad. means non Covid folks also get fucked get sick/Injured/etc bc limited hospital space. 

This happening across country. need strong government action force folks wear masks. mask, get fine. back account pay ignorance. Depends age. lot us 40s lost immunity one three, even *with* childhood booster. found new employer required titer immunity measles. I’m kind glad take van last year! Florida here, howdy Yep. I'm conservative come trusted looks made right calls. memorial day thing husband tried use position coerce dock company put boat, defying *her* *own* *order*, said husband joking would make call first place already knew answer? kinda irked Honestly, take names put list. get sick, need denied medical treatment. 

If want refuse measures protect health, lose treatment. Hospital space limited anyways. saying what's occured inadequate amplification negative tests following initial positive, subsequent positive occurs adequate amplification yield positive? So, differing number cycles amplification yielding different results?

Is protocol somewhat standardized, least patient? sensible? get too, like make easy username. fine, grates times.  Rest world = probably free

US = free Furthermore, whole ""I'd rather dead wrong"" all-in philosophy undermining many pillars sociopolitical system years. pandemic made measurable. Thank you! Hang there! deserve several raises! :( 

I feeling coming due everything wife described, still saddening. goes show young fit guarantee. 

I hope wife good support system kids :( Surprise, another brand new account spamming threads bullshit. don’t know; AAP released statement support reopening schools *other* risks isolating children without peer socialization. parents smashed work obligations childcare obligations—if can’t put food table pay rent without school, supposed do? 6/15-21 = 11.4% positivity

6/22-28 = 15.5% positivity

6/29-7/4 = 18.5% positivity

My goodness Yes. American, underestimate ignorance stupidity. percentage actual covid cases? CFR 30-39 age Israel 0.1%, obviously IFR much lower.

0.3-0.5%? maybe hospital care available. Agreed. They’re lying purpose money. Sorry buddy, can't come in. feels like punch gut. Well stay house ""yours"" let everyone else worry theirs. would mindset get go, could saved everyone 10 minutes time Nobody’s guaranteed make 20s 30s. That’s actually something I’ve struggling lot. I’m 20s hit tractor trailer earlier year taking dog vet 5 min road. Anything happen time. I’m staying lot newfound appreciation life accident. get one shot earth, know staying right thing can’t help feel like I’m wasting time can’t get back. genuinely wants know. I'm denying covid-19 kill healthy people I'll take chances company killed african people failed experiment major cover it. God... Damn... feel sorry family. just. Jesus Christ virus absolutely brutalized poor bastard Remember would go away ""one fine day April?""

It didn't.

Nor May.

Nor June.

Now we're July, setting record numbers daily. Well, least got reduced one third initially said. locked cases dropped level contact tracing would possible. Blood clotting Deaths March infections still trickling in- people infected weekend still dying hospitalized October. bad mortality rate low people co-morbidities compromised immune system.. could great chance lose idiots whoever happen reproduce with.. 

I hate fucking mask, even care looks cool, hell I'm Scorpion fan (sorry sub zero dont get here).

 wear mask respect others' health concerns knows one people would doctor completely ignore qualification start screaming one burn death radicalized protestor happened mishandle poorly constructed molotov cocktail Protests part spike cases. However, many states Florida Texas, opened soon covid cases began skyrocket stage protests weird family already plans mask burning bob fire clear given it’s safe so. Although plan keeping diaper changes stop gaging poopy diapers kids new cases yes use combined total cases deaths done better. 

This would good comparison due combined land mass population common knowledge. Many mild illnesses treated like ""the flu"" cause hospitalizations even testing sporadic, unless there's reason expect new infection. Even needs enough infected people compare samples demonstrate new microorganism causing infection. Odds new infections like COVID-19 identified China, Western Europe America regardless originates. global hub cities high population densities sufficient wealth precautionary testing. Go Yes. live Berlin check live map site tells related news current R0 number, along many new infected. course long incubation period, showing current situation. However know steadily rising, also much raises risk infection stay extra careful. COVID-19 need look 2-3 weeks back taking deaths.

Two weeks ago Texas 7 day moving average around 3k cases per day, double increase began start June so.

The moving average deaths almost exactly doubled too. Seems pretty even correlation far Seems like perfect time address administrative bloat could bad luck. missed yearly annual really need thyroid levels checked i'm scared. Anyone idea safest way get bloodwork aside gp? want go labcorp they're testing arent they? explain results two papers, especially first one:

 

 

They amplifying viral fragments get positive viral test--they **fully symptomatic COVID-19 second occasion** long temporal separation first ordeal (""clinically virologically positive"" phrase used article describe it--in press peer-reviewed accepted journal). testing cases. see variations level amplification viral particles could explain would positive coronavirus 11 totally distinct patients like that, would explain symptoms clearly indicated second bout COVID-19. Theodore Roosevelt sailors. second positive test, second bout COVID symptoms. Measles unique (and vaccine) generate really powerful, lifelong immunity. many bugs like will. called Covid Chinese virus? 1/4 entire world's deaths one country 

And guys like like ""its looking good!"" None really sad. think story scared March, really hoping happier outcome...his wife, can’t even imagine watching Last 2 weeks cases exploded. hospitals starts getting full.... like NYC hell break loose Ontario handling better Quebec 350 million people US makes wonder many hate crimes Asians occur regular 4 month spans? safety: mRNA non-infectious, non-integrating platform, potential risk infection insertional mutagenesis.

[What definition disability Dr Tam, essentially Fauci counterpart Canada (she Chief Public Health Officer) terms figurehead speaks media

She exact thing switched stance masks. Canada see resistance masks since did.

If use theory - that? shithole country. Egypt also sucks nurse, traveler, Cath Lab tech.

I worked Cath lab constantly bringing travel techs/nurses fill slots. gathered, you’re travel agency, they’ll basically tell assignments available where, let know ones you’re interested in. hospital/department likes resume provided agency, they’ll perform interview two phone make decision. I, rest staff, would involved phone interviews help evaluate candidate give input towards making decision bring in. Pretty straightforward far interviewing hospital positions. hear getting agency bit complicated paperwork licensure involved. actual traveler would able help better area.

As far hiring hospitals knowing candidates “any good”, it’s really roll dice, almost never know you’re going get till they’re there. I’ve worked numerous techs/nurses CLEARLY fudged resume/interview nowhere near experience claimed...like, blatantly obvious. I’ve also worked we’re great; hospitals/departments really need vetting...especially they’re paying traveler 2-3x they’re paying staff. 20* America? One million dollars.

In Mexico? 73 pesos Horrifying sad. Put virus months ago never recovering. Condolences awareness. Businesses dependent tourism border crossings hit hard closed borders.

However [doctors challenged claim]( [the elderly survivors first triaged given care families protested]( living challenges claim themselves. 

Anyway, article that: also finds Swedish NPI recommendations quite effective. conclusion study is: Swedish COVID-19 strategy thus far yielded striking result: mild mandates overlaid voluntary measures achieve results highly similar late-onset stringent mandates. However, policy causes healthcare demand mortality early stringent control depends continued public will.


Things definitely went better could overall Swedes relatively good job adhering recommendations. didn’t realize pandemic intensely obedient authority Swedes generally are, must admit *really* proving listen authorities follow directives situations.

Still, study [like previous one]( concludes Sweden could avoided many deaths taken earlier stringent control measures. data mounting Sweden could done better, also could done lot worse. nothing faith. government shown desperation reopen economy willingness spend money stimulate it. vaccine ultimate expression/resolution that.

Why downvoting polite, reasoned responses? seriousness, that's really good question easy answers.

But alas, America, least, education defunded. progressive, advanced methods learning never happen million years Minimum manning? Anchor shut off. Crew required = zero. means they're expensive start again, oh well. Guess registered tax legal shelter countries support industry. really matter live law enforcement enforce mask ordinance, cite businesses refuse ask customers leave wearing masks. live far western North Carolina expecting number new infections keep rising either everyone infected vaccine. Cancer researcher here. confirm. would job stopped testing cancer. Psycho..... I’ve made many “when plans” feeling it’s going end whimper vday level accomplishment. Child abuse?? Wow... that’s major stretch. really think type. say love kids socially isolated? What’s fucked insinuating someone don’t know abusing children following health recommendations pandemic, making best crappy situation still managing enjoy life. 

When even say socially isolated? parents laws live home. We’ve done virtual play dates 3-4 days week since school let March. past month outside friends riding bikes going walks almost every day. Properly socially distanced, course. got laid mid March helps I'm living parents still girlfriend really took advantage month got new job. Got great shape spent lot times parks really great dangerous? really sad, hoping turned corner. people need take virus seriously. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

I love that, remember trying say ""The ghost scared me"" spanish class once.... Saying ""Tengo mierdas"" instead tengo miedo.

Best part watching spanish teacher try explain laughing. way much faith current government shows. They're corrupt shit show agenda profit power. opened indoor dining starting today, gyms, movie theaters, etc. I

JFC. KNOW indoor dining risk, guess every state find themselves... miss dancing sport events.. otherwise gave average people long time ago mean, hope is, I'm counting either. Keeping things closed extracts huge economic cost people, strike balance somewhere. Re-opening guided hospitalization rates, infection rates, testing capacity. Fortunately NY good place respect metrics right now. changes they'll open reversing course needed honestly think another pandemic would bad. Look Asia, experience handled covid. completely fine. Obviously talking US Brazil, see Germans kicking ass another pandemic rolls around, know act get shit effectively. huge learning experience public health lot people (including politicians) want repeat roaring 20s end people starving propped stock market crashing many flat earthers non american? 


It isn’t exactly delusional think america full people dumb enough attach whole worldview easily debunked conspiracy theories rest world laughs irrelevant anecdote?

I added info article comment, stranger sent one time took ferry ride. Unreal Humble brag. Yeah clearly nuance evades you. 

Not protests same. One group let's say keeps six feet space wears masks another group wears masks space exercise routines part protests. can't see one would less risky partisan hack.

One group literally protesting told anything reduce spread disease course dangerous protest. would filled people would higher risk would practices would limit spread.

So yes every activity risk even BLM protests activities equally risky. can't see one riskier others stupid partisan hack. 

This even consider reason protesting. activities require trade risk vs benefit. One protests sought create change would increase spread disease kills people. protests sought stop government murdering people found guilty crime jury peers. wonder one doctors would find compelling ones saying doctors stupid risking lives one trying save lives? 

Get partisan bullshit, sides always equal big difference. Outside masked dramatically less likely spread virus unmasked indoors. I’m Canada implementing mandatory face masks fb blowing people bitching.

We also weird clause, health issues etc don’t need wear one that’s everyone going “I asthma” etc 9 12 Trust me, Europeans stupid Americans. forget ""There evidence immunity"" ""asymptomatic people spread virus"". mean learn speak reporters now? someone playing game chicken boston-area landlords right now, great hope schools follow suit Fortunately health insurance companies (not sure self-insured companies work) policies also limit exposure outbreak like this. Either way anxious see rates look like enrollment hear that. unfortunately can’t individually take every persons life account.

Uhh, ADA explicitly that. Uh, no, doesn't. 

Requiring people wear masks public certainly within state's Police powers. 

A MAGA hat political statement. wear hat, mask, even clothing covering genitalia not. pattern see handles things make several public statements “there evidence X true”. 

When hear someone say ""there evidence x"" assume: (1) x true (2) know (3) they'd prefer act like x false.

If x false know it, say ""x false""? like idea, sure could instituted state want people wearing masks anywhere near hospital right now.  like idea forcing people refuse take action safe guard community see end results covid-19. 

Maybe punish community service, grave digging projects around state people dig mass grave hand tools wheelbarrows. Wasn’t heat supposed kill Virus? /s

I feel folks Arizona. lot friends flabbergasted nonchalantly Arizonans treating thing. many still calling hoax there. would defeat purpose since people would use spaces, characters etc avoid automod. Actually start fine 1st. go straight jail though made it: 
Covid19/USA: 3 Mio. total cases. 
But still people making jokes it.  opposite here. whole year one big trainwreck. Time passing pretty quickly due shit going on. Yes, they're typically like one person poster talked about...

Poster store wearing mask. (This month ago.) older couple comes poster tells posters mask wearing unnecessary starts lecturing poster. Poster explains s/he works nurse coronavirus patients. woman couple starts freaking screaming poster even store.

You put people sick they'll start using PPE faithfully. talk big distance. Canada another country structured like that, many ways provinces even autonomy US states. Yes article even 6 feet space kids, minimum amount kids. masks.
You can't pretend everything fine put everyone risk.
Los Angeles Unified even considering plan current explosion Except Cloud Atlas...which thought kinda refreshing see villainous. 

""Here's understand:

1. Vaccines coronaviruses often extremely ineffective""

Where get information? vaccines coronaviruses animals created effective. Companies pursued vaccines coronaviruses causes colds humans big enough market, ineffective.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't confuse fact created vaccine coronaviruses cause colds done now. Treatment, treatment, treatment. like Flu. Cue gap year duck misery Zoom U! Tedros: 🙈 nuanced view immunity:

Much like memories, immunity infectious agents wanes age. get corona young child immunity likely remain lifetime, quality quantity cells diminishes time even things survive bout tend confer shorter less quality immunity time. flu shots work well old people get bigger doses adjuvants. asked right question. don’t think wants win all. He’s something can’t bullshit way of, real leader. He’s effectively quit already. leader worth salt would elbow deep jump. passes buck, lies, shoves fairy dust ass hoping go away day. know signs might get bad, many people get really sick mild suddenly get much worse hesitate seek help minute feel worse. Take advice given seriously, rest, fluids.

These breathing exercises credibility take look: luck take care! think??? could told opening early! Well people generally get tested symptoms 5+7 minimum. Hopefully lockdown lifetime thing. Think opportunity relax, better (focus hobby, learn new skill) 


Come lockdown feeling refreshed stronger you! governor lift order overrule can. thought process? Karen, unable sit restaurant abusive towards servers, complete meltdown unleashed full fury defenseless mask racks silently mock abusive impotence.... likely help themselves, question always ""can help long run flout containment strategies social distancing"". Personally, yet see anything points latter true Antibodies standing ready neutralize virus second enters system. Memory cells take little bit time ramp activity again. They’ll help clear virus faster, won’t prevent getting infected entirely. won’t happen ship sailed part issue states left whatever get go take years takes years get volunteers, set get approval trials, etc. take years people examining data years. I've done vaccine trials animal level, including one currently Phase 2 human trials. thing could missing long term safety data, would fair criticism. long term safety affects unlikely. ones people worry would surface first days. idiots cause least harm...

Has worked guys guess... Sorry dont think store near security. Obviously security would option I'm sure common many places. would think. work jamba amount people repeatedly come without mask throw fit ask call curbside insane. Like, lady, I've already told day. people reasonable go get mask car lot people shitty it, need job I'd quit here. Wish people state would take seriously, mess now. love someone says something like ""oh stop, 1 10,000"" whatever...ok go pick next one...sheesh still SOMEONE &amp; someone means everything others~ richest country dumbest evil leader.   Ok. Here's opportunity downvote again! Hope makes day better :) sure sounds like it, maybe use face shield along mask. eyes port entry. true introvert yes yes do. covid parties needed. Yes, move tourist location pandemic. Gold advice. guess start seeing infections summer true. state nation allow don’t follow CDC guidelines register DNR dont waste medical supplies them. many people don’t give damm situation. need job, Go bag bodies flip ventilated patients. Linked article useless contains information study.

The Lancet publication study here:

""Briefly, 35 883 households selected stratified two-stage sampling, strata formed cross-classifying 50 Spanish provinces two autonomous cities (appendix p 19) municipalities grouped size (&lt;5000, 5000–19 999, 20 000–99 999, ≥100 000 residents). 1500 census tracts initially selected probability proportional size, 24 households randomly sampled within selected census tract National Institute Statistics. residents household invited participate study, resulting selected sample 102 562 individuals  news hovers whereas thought flung across room? first skeptical article source. really says Spain found 5% antibody prevalence rate. 

It shown antibodies often fade rapidly post infection (especially asymptomatic cases), whether still long lasting immunity unknown. cant find equipment anywhere right now. sucks. started cooking never ordered anything, sodas alcohol either, I’ve lost 10 pounds even though already pretty skinny. totally capable it. world shows that...although, fair (and bad thing) technology might biggest catalyst moral understandings. also fucking apes mostly understand think apes...we mostly think understand ourselves, individually, don't. 

While believe humanity certainly orders magnitude better morally agree think percentages small. That's I'd rather roll dice ASI... big pussy Trudeau might be, he's still million times better Trump. He's borderline retarded befriend world's evil people  Again, allow links like Google amps. Again, approved article exact subject. Chill. believe real leftists protesting polarizing itself. US would first declare countries failed states what’s happening US currently happened anywhere else Still killed thousands definitely close time. Including 60's 70's. YOLO Well crap, evidence aiming herd immunity would Toronto Maple leafs fan make fun someone else 😂 wonder think *Philadelphia* would ""canceled"" released today. Facts. Dont feel impending break society Sweden? hamsters cute. Also think behaving ""as if"" someone environment fact benefit anyone acts assumption (i.e. follows guidelines) long run.

I totally gave specific real work example happening; misleading false information?

You said Corey Hannon Covid positive even received test results yet. Ohh b, twice. beginning May reopening stared happening, 2 months. Protests started May 26th, point still stands tho think death rate lagged 2weeks back April/May testing limited. sick enough get test, would die 2 weeks later.

Now enough testing catch early cases, means death rate lags 3-5 weeks testing case spikes. :( already misanthrope this, pandemic reinforced beliefs Yeah, sounds way reasonable fine. automod, it’ll use certain trigger words. know fact name Democratic presidential candidate one. Oddly enough, word Trump isn’t. Reported. Keep going. nightclubs open? Seriously? It’s misapplying scientific principle sacrificing American lives failed attempt keep economy going. NBD. would’ve locked properly proper stimulus could nearly back normal like much Europe instead mess now. Letters like sent universities. seems like schools aren’t taking seriously aren’t looking lives stake bringing students across country also rooting mother nature? Praise be. pamphlet mention distancing wearing mask? Otherwise I'd concerned people resistant mask wearing see out. ""I want wear mask. see I'm taking precautions. I'm exercising drinking water."" never claimed that. opinion 1% many endemic virus is. Leading deaths? take population country consideration Also 100% people breathe air die eventually maybe hold breath! Lol @ pandy. one haven’t heard perfect example time police involved least peripherally involved. woman obviously mental issues regular beat cop likely trained handle kind situation. need qualified mental health professional help deescalate situation make sure woman gets help needs rather throwing jail totally get point, please realize people states acted way. I'm AZ, family stayed home since middle March (weeks idiot governor told people stay home). lifted stay home order absolutely nothing changed us, knew soon. took seriously part, really scary us need medical care reason might unable get it, hospitals pretty much full. We're morons, unfortunately lot people are. suffer stupidity. increased dosage? doc started lowest dose 2 weeks, saw improvement. bumped dose up, it’s 2 weeks since that, I’m starting see glimmer hope. drinking waaay much past months. Stay strong. automatically though. Money would help ton kids alternative in-person think can't find 20 examples stupid and/or corrupt leaders around world within 20 second Google search?

And what's worse - ""the world"" lets leaders take institute terrorist regimes, dictatorships, attempts take world (until U.S.'s ""stupid leaders"" stepped kick Axis ass. currently rule Imperial Japan Nazi Germany today, go hug American). Ahh epitome snowflake! Bravo! article came 3 weeks ago. I'm sure never saw light day interesting read. surely wrong absolutely couple articles interesting thing calling deaths low 300 late June/July sort right. voted Justin Trudeau...  New president, dis? Trump needs 51% vote 22% population (middle America) win election. Even Biden gets 100% 78% population 49% ""crucial rural"" states. America's electoral system joke many families school-aged children, viable daycare alternative school.

Some fortunate enough financial means hire 1:1 nanny, enter ""nanny share"" 1 families, hire babysitter hours day. depending live, options could easily exceed $100 $200 day.

For option work home, schools open fall, many families choice leave workforce care children. even _can_ work home, really possible teach, parent, work full-time job day. going wind shitty job three.

If want keep schools closed (which agree everybody's best interest), parents need either:

* Extended Family Medical Leave — 12 weeks 2/3rds pay included Families First Coronavirus Response Act. good start, that's going cut we're waiting vaccine reopen schools. also solve problem getting parents back work.
* Subsidized Daycare Stipends — as mentioned earlier, hiring nanny cost prohibitive. want parents go back work, money going come somewhere.

You make argument parents foot bill children's childcare needs pandemic, reality many **simply can't**. important note that's UK might true; universal healthcare government helping pay people's lost job wages. US, things exist.

Also, I've suffering immensely lockdown involuntary solo isolation, living anyone else pets. loneliness depression stifling. believe business ask nature disability spirit assisting way helps disability. think ask proof, think say, ""Hey standing issue, bring chair"" kinda thing.  outside seems mean 10% Ohio voters decide next president is. U.S much gonna cost me? I'm gonna guess supposed ""societal"" using voice-to-text. line thinking immature nieve best. must American politicians substantial accountability actions here. 

You telling wish innocent people die may stroke ego say ""Ha, politician wrong. told so!"". know wrong care concern reelected. Right wrong, state's Governor believes reopening month long shutdown help chances furthering political career. kill people ages. Even influenza same. matter risk. dead age draw short straw.

There graph [this breaks US deaths age group.

It shows 1780 dead Americans 35-44 age bracket 6/17/2020.   end dead, question why. Honestly, god filmmaker hope is, final episode season, maybe second final, trump die covid. agree Especially US seems huge concern, yes. (But even medical debt thing countries, job loss is, social security always place especially developing countries. exclusively American problem.) speaking teachers parents point view? Speaking parents point view here, three small children, get shortened day classroom home. face extremist-left thinks morally superior refusing meet with/be around people think differently do. handing Trump election even comprehend it. Lmao Well didn’t work!! bank holiday weekend. agree news, posted video online? TRIED.  But, state rainy-day fund state legislature repeatedly told UNC system (and parts state government) need separate rainy-day funds.  also think widespread appeal general trustworthyness makes talking experience really valuable. Mexico seriously undercounting Covid-19 cases deaths policy. Well people going die going say told so. fun teasing way, no. sad core. Come man pull together, country needs you. hazmet suit take care concerns. dont evidence prove it. Good luck brave pilgrim. *is* placebo, medical experts agree it. reason neither cloth, medical masks filters small enough viruses. people wear beleive safer, end less cautious overall. study compared two totally different cities, really poor evidence masks work. 

 masks also create environment bacteria thrives in. concern people typically dying covid itself, secondary pneumonia infections. get bacterial pneumonia infection wear mask, reinfecting over. say protect others, protect you. actually make things worse you. especially problem wear longer periods, wash it, live humid environments, live warm environments, cloth mask vs medical mask. Cloth masks, medical masks filter viruses far smaller size filters masks. filter bacteria viruses. 

From first article:

The physical properties cloth mask, reuse, frequency effectiveness cleaning, increased moisture retention, may potentially increase infection risk HCWs. virus may survive surface facemasks, modelling studies quantified contamination levels masks.Self-contamination repeated use improper doffing possible. example, contaminated cloth mask may transfer pathogen mask bare hands wearer. also showed filtration extremely poor (almost 0%) cloth masks. Observations SARS suggested double-masking practices increased risk infection moisture, liquid diffusion pathogen retention. effects may associated cloth masks.

we also analysis mask wearers, higher infection rate cloth mask group second article: "" penetration cloth masks particles almost 97% compared medical masks third article:

Additionally, bacterial count external surface second mask significantly higher first wore masks spanish flu pandemic, found make difference infection rates. start move goalpost... deaths rising states outbreak. look moving averages texas florida undeniably uptrend even biggest US holiday pandemic date. vaccine changed course trials, besides early adjustments doses (they always try mix low high doses early find side effects/determine much actually necessary). vaccine get day approve October (cross fingers) exact initially decided test spring. sign fuck*s DN annoy daily re-subscription phone calls cancel abonnemang offer new subscription... worth it. put archive search engine find articles DN. prevent Trump, failed purpose entirely. never mentiomed personal history all.

Finland Norway. still really indicative free country though. able buy vodka 7 11 4am much freer, objectively speaking. like DK nice booze shops too. travel restrictions, would definitely assume passengers american tourists. lot problems studies including often cut short due pandemic peer reviewed weeks back. dunno serve volunteers; noted below, people definitely disruptive hamper operations, requiring babysitting. 

Now maybe set sort isolated observation room behind mirrored glass, required hours per day, might trick. Watching intubations medically inducing coma ventilation ... might trick. 

The main thing need actually see stuff sink in. can't lecture them, show video nameless face; needs experienced personally.  used word ""college"". Extremely obsessively stupid. ok Scheer keeps getting muted zoom  actually getting tired much winning.

3 million cases, 25% world wide total. right know whether incapacitated incapable leading, check ensure 25th Amendment appropriately followed carried out. It’s clear procedures followed many times last century kind oversight needed

My point even public knows there's absolutely recourse anything it. president could trapped pocket dimension, path replacing would still 25th impeachment. Yes need make companies accountable protecting employees. employers afraid fines lawsuits coronvirus infections deaths would see lot responsible behavior. Merica. COVID-19 spreads 32 feet breathing. getting difficult distinguish delusions, stupidity, friends president, combination. 
Hats officer keeping professional. 
I would definitely said FFS camera.

I guess maybe BLM stage one. Heh. Wow, day, time now. say, 78 though, would seem lived pretty full life. expected read less 60 so. See lockdown great get stay home significant other. still go work full time really different normal life stress. ones us enjoying lockdown ones get stay home partner whatever want ""Herd immunity"" massive health crisis afterwards...we know Coronavirus leave behind horrible disorders stay decades. find region reduction covid 19 line Jena, per article, region wear face masks would immediately invalidate conclusion face masks defining characteristic cause reduction.

 I'd stunned easily demonstrable.

PPP loans geared keep people employed. thought would better letting firms layoff massive amounts people pending turnaround.

As goal keep people employed, bill exceptions firms deemed worthy keep people employed.

I'm sure anyone surprised note-worthy companies took loans. Trump isn’t holding person meetings. He’s throwing recreational rallies thousands people, mask social distancing optional. usually case, matter bad gets him, usually gets MUCH worse. Alberta wants go BC too? ""dependent"" US what?

Their market silly 🤭 coronavirus doesn’t survive chlorinated water long pool properly maintained guess comes trusting taking care water conditions. It’s not. It’s CDC recommendation city, county, state requirement live. Continue absolutely skeptical, continue trying mitigate risk others listening scientific advice argumentative prove point, stance needlessly risks others health. anyone find source link information presented article?   Probably that. 3 million people sort symptoms, plus anywhere 10 million 30 million walking around right now, unaware it. Yeah, figured would way I’d antibodies 4-5 mo later considering I’d read people’s test experiences  that's good rule live - always listen expert sand scientists ;) *calls friend whose boyfriend drives 18 wheelers*

Just get shipped Windsor, guys. I'll handle rest. We'll need keep quarantined couple weeks get here, handle that. 🚛 Imagine, literally imagine (I not) taking anyone seriously blames ""surge"" solely ""partying"" without even mentioning protests, rioting, looting.

Imagine.

BuT WoRe mASks!  Ya someone would’ve worn mask stupid podium we’d much better whole community.  article rife delusion. mislead altered title apologize. could watch video time. Aha ok. west slav actually similarity sure :) New buzz word “T cells” 3 months ago...

We pretty much completely self sufficient PPE now

The pulp needed proper n95 masks comes source present Canada iirc . thing is, complete dicks gonna fuck rest world planning study? lose placement scholarships take semester two? would stay home. Like there's several DIFFERENT viruses.

But often hear couples one got horrible case virus asymptomatic. one gave other, that's virus. 

Even case, odds Nick Cordero gave virus wife, ended perfectly fine infection resulted put ventilator? Sha Na Na Super late update. cat got lost outdoors stuck neighbors house 3 days (how didnt know long completely different issue), local cat napper - yes someone stealing neighborhood cats.  


So - built catio! far good enough. wanted update found solution! kind avowal sounds really familiar reason. keep seeing people FB making fun mask rules. ""I wear mask get in, take eat drink. virus smart knows attack stand up!!!"" Like......no......you know dumb rule really keep safe. STAY HOME KIDS SAFE new news here? two mutually exclusive? maybe ER ICU staff go strike . Yep. I’m Florida educator got email within last half hour read entire order. already teacher sub shortage, knows happen now. math game. hospitalization rates younger people lower older people. But, time, many young people getting infected cancels out.  *That know of* Ready fill pews Easter? far know Finland offered help non-corona ICU patients healthcare system North Sweden becomes overloaded. Seems still working help needed - probably hands Finnish regulars. doubt we’ll hear trial vaccine deaths serious side effects. today’s world, news would travel well would spread lot fear. like Lone Ranger love baseball things — cancel season. Cancel sports, frankly. We’re clearly enough stay safe. moral obligation ensure safety. letting nonviolent offenders much possible. Also, let many people indefinitely detained ICE camps out.

Anne Frank literally died like early 1945, typhus epidemic spread camp, killing 17,000 prisoners.[60] diseases, including typhoid fever, rampant.[61] Due chaotic conditions, possible determine specific cause Anne's death; however, evidence died epidemic. Gena Turgel, survivor Bergen Belsen, knew Anne Frank camp. 2015, Turgel told British newspaper, Sun: “Her bed around corner me. delirious, terrible, burning up,” adding brought Frank water wash.[62] Turgel, worked camp hospital, said typhus epidemic camp took terrible toll inmates. “The people dying like flies — hundreds.” “Reports used come — 500 people died. Three hundred? said, ‘Thank God, later testified Margot fell bunk weakened state killed shock. Anne died days Margot. exact dates Margot's Anne's deaths recorded. long thought deaths occurred weeks British soldiers liberated camp 15 April 1945,[63] research 2015 indicated may died early February.[64] Among evidence, witnesses recalled Franks displayed typhus symptoms 7 February,[3][65] Dutch health authorities reported untreated typhus victims died within 12 days first symptoms.

from wiki.

I know people like comparison, literally disease sweeping though concentration camps people dying covid.

They deserve death penalty seeking asylum can't make bail small amount drugs etc. take working film production: COVID filming plans I’ve seen require something like weekly testing crew, even frequent actors people can’t socially distance easily. 

If they’re tested multiple times week, 14-day lockdown probably isn’t needed much. 

I haven’t seen production’s UK-based guidelines, seems general standard that’s emerging. Good see hope continues. see now, simple. much understand things important, people loosing jobs, getting evicted homeless, pure tragedy, sports music wait  Still better sniffing maple farts sniffing covid. He's dead inside. Fear biggest viral load. Sniff sniff. What's smell? Cooked books. really informative rather take vaccine that’s tested clinical trials heavily researched virus itself.

But two options. far nuanced options that. changed testing re-testing.  Turns ""We're gonna die"" popular narrative. I’m judging bad behavior, asshat. shared observed. Random hookups hookups? Yep. I’m fine judging. go right ahead get head ascribe notions motivations I’m good cursory observations. 

Unless somehow reconcile people fucking pandemic put positive spin it. Well, 6ft thing always wishful thinking part.  Same. want life back. question make sense?? No.

 adds  Local funding provides little public schooling. Federal funding 10%. rest comes state, lot states, like ours, state portion comes part lotto (shut weeks) local funding comes property taxes (temporarily delayed). I'm saying money spent, way replace quickly easily. Upstate NY here. already have. weekend saw license plates multiple states including Illinois South Carolina. travel ban farce. wait... Lol yeah come ICU capacity, stay chili 😂. seriously stay safe shit getting scary everywhere seems... ""user"" spam bot probably question here...  got haircut, wearing mask. I'm pretty sure even need bachelor's degree nurse. know correct goalposts are, scenario never previously experienced.

Ignorant people seem mistake uncertainty intentional misinformation. I’ve never actually watched Fox News myself, could tell? way shut up. speculation confirmed yet... address people confused wide range symptoms... might something viral load.

For example, large dose coronavirus would result severe symptoms small dose coronavirus would result milder symptoms.

  unfuckingreal 6 months crisis hospitals still dont enough PPE get saying, initial doomsday reaction perhaps overblown. that's way new crisis history. may helped find way handle future anxiety next shitstorm/World War/pandemic happens lifetime. century handful them.

Regarding success story, looks like US handling situation suboptimally compared Europe Eastern Asia, best balance health/economy/freedoms. Hopefully, peaking ICU capacity become overburdened post-July 4 surge manage ride storm. seem be, age group, “just flu bro”, least terms mortality. schools reopen. earth would take child teenager, Carsyn Davis, cancer survivor rare, ongoing autoimmune disorder. Election year

Personal gain takes precedence public interest Well, well, well, turntables... Let lawsuits begin Well, ongoing trials, preliminary evidence. PrEP PEP thing case HIV, though ask case recent updates don’t know about.

My grandfather who’s 95 lot comorbities admitted hospital stay while. hospital exploding coronavirus cases, he’ll likely die gets it. That’s reason asked. I’m assuming aren’t requiring weekly testing? testing kind? stupid enough go Disney World, means, world could without you. least considerate enough stay fuck away live Windsor, across Detroit, masks mandatory public places weeks Duuuude asshat epitome bootlicking ignorant fool?


Like fuck learn. something would expect state run Alex Jones something. governors choose ignore them. lot governors listened worked health secretaries well far ones headlines right haven’t. hell happened comment section?

You can’t deny teenager disease. Stabilized, hit terminal velocity? What’s happening Trump DeSantis see Coronavirus political opponent defeat rallying base. Yup. pretty much know mortality know increases mortality, I’m sure debate X: Doubt sounds... interesting think actually en France. That's want us think! DeSantis officially lost goddamn mind. Sorry leave visit new yacht... ""Bro FUCKING kidding literally way Madagascar shit happens"" Seriously. pandemic shown us anything, advanced/graduate degrees overpriced mostly obtain online courses. Graduate degrees public sector free tuition. Take even further, certain degrees free obtain state colleges. instance: medical, legal, engineering degrees. Require 5 years service afterwards part free tuition. headline article, heaven forbid actually gave news instead trying scare everyone. Cause 50 percent Reddit believes immunity 3 6 months. even year (its probably more) take every year flu shot. big deal. free pass brown skin incidents happen. tragic, expected. mean, already has. He's polling 10 points ahead Trump nationally, and, critically, he's 50 percent polls. comparison, point 2016 Clinton ahead 4 points, around 45 percent polls. whereas 2016 voters disliked candidates overwhelmingly preferred Trump Clinton, year polls show overwhelmingly prefer Biden Trump. Unless something massive changes net months — possible, less less likely every day — Trump headed crushing defeat. Sadly, people considered unimportant many due age &amp; pre-exisiting conditions. think also fact infection number dwarfs number deaths large margin. changing goalposts general public can't handle truth.

They trickled restrictions get people comply. two weeks, it! extend. Problem works short-term lose trust compliance long term. Fatigue sets in, cried wolf many times, even partial truth.

They never set end-date. Never. Oof. true. mention testing per capita piss poor. seems like we've actually *slowed down* testing recent weeks could finite could lifelong, without hard data could anything. gonna do, tweet me? People Toronto taking seriously. subway basically like sunday morning crowd size time. took subway accross city Canada day maybe say &lt; 10 people... INSANE one largest cities americas. definately dummies there, part great. One created June 23 10,000 goal organized friend Ashley Walters behalf mother.

Also update first page also page word word. know, seems bit suspicious. wonder family aware page?

*Edit: say proceeds going mother second one (in text, area organizer.) likes body like herpes flares throughout life?  immunity lasts year so?  long-term damage leads permanent disability? stupid question. might seasonal vaccine, maybe get yearly semi-annually, quarterly. 

It might end something like tetanus vaccine get early life boosters throughout life. 

Or, maybe ends working like Measles vaccine need once; based very, early studies date seems unlikely would once-and-done affair.

It might end different vaccines provide different levels protection, one makes illness manageable without hospital care, another provides robust immunity infection entirely. Maybe none initial candidates work well enough bother with.

I think know enough yet *any* candidate vaccines say long provide immunity, much immunity provided. I’m sure would made difference red hat areas Monday July 6th.2020 first day since March 29th Ontario Canada deaths due Corona Virus. mistaken. goal flatten curve. age well father went go get tested, tested negative. serious doubt test 's validity. starters, shell $80 got results day. reference, we're Florida testing site called Keter Medical Center &amp; Spa. anyone shed light validity it? wants help yard sale sell stuff want take California. one hand, swears people still going yard sales...but sure ok even true. =/ America best country world /s. shore crowded vacationers, also retirees started migrating back shore. eventually achieve widespread use! Pretty low mortality, around 0.1-02% seen rich nations mass testing (Qatar , UAE Singapore)  US stifling free exchange information getting ass kicked result. 

Seattle told feds fuck testing themselves, done well ever since. agree assessment..

Its Saudis 70's w/ oil embargo apartheid supporting countries. simply cut tap. US kissed ass ever since..

The US member OPEC OPEC money US banks..great arrangement

Now Saudis *support* apartheid countries..

With Walmart largest employer US stocked gills Chinese goods, similar off-switch could unrecoverable. whole thread depressing. easy forget nurses doctors human first. 
I can't imagine working hospital must feel like, especially current situation. 
But yes, expect better nurse. sad. Whaaaaaat masks work?

Let go. death Broadway actor Nick Cordero Covid-19 shaken people far beyond theater world, large part 41 reportedly underlying health experts said Mr. Cordero’s death underscored multitude unknowns coronavirus — including ways could imperil even young, healthy people appear increased risk contracting severe idea ‘I’m young, I’ll fine’ idea completely subscribe to,” said Dr. Utibe Essien, physician health equity researcher University Kloots, Mr. Cordero’s wife, said known pre-existing conditions might worsened course disease. data emerges, serious cases younger, healthy people like becoming less anomaly, doctors said. Well ask average person 1) flatten curve 2) wait vaccine 3) wait for...uh.. Covid guess? I’m sure.

These vague answers see social media feed (and here!), obviously piss poor job officials explaining it. 

And correct, accomplished half 1 part 2, southern hospitals overwhelmed again. see people confused. hope prayers health

I stick science medicine, appreciate sentiment. Well seems even test negative still positive next day, friends uncle tested negative yesterday he’a positive today even NATO member.

No, - made country. Someone invented Eurovision everyone assumed real. Ask - Estonia real place, come nobody ever there? would good time take gap year college, Freshman, attend local state school/community college plan transfer 1 - 2 years needed. There's reason pay top dollar reduced experience. 

That said, people expect colleges impossible. Students going pay tuition online university. students pay, professors get paid. Professors seem think get paid endowment magical coffer sorts enormous complications make far less possible outside industry think. 

Unless government proposes even bigger bailout/basic income situation has, people going choose working safety precautions place working figuring sustain financially. real issue individual employers, government shit together. 

It's complex issue though....it's worth pointing though risk death serious complications students small far know, rare serious complications many viruses spread around college campuses regularly - meningitis, mono, even flu. 

Also, according article 37% professors age 55, far higher industries. lead example article 70 year old emeritus professor. College campuses full senior professors can't figure technology save lives refuse retire despite financially capable so. lack space younger, diverse, talented academics massive issue field....I feeling colleges perfectly happy professors planning return. always claim actions resulted bad thing God's will. perverted religion. ahahahahahaa buwuhahahahahahaaa Americans explain government leaders, likely studied law college leading war coronavirus?

Do states medical council, medical leaders make individual decisions override law student?

I'm confused America allows uneducated politicians talk science? allowed? allow this?

Curious non american... guys claim people officially “gay” “retarded” claiming Coronavirus masks fake 90% idiot population stop becoming viral terrorists. Wait 2 weeks bro Naw, herd immunity means reduced transmission vectors. Eventually could theoretically die that's long time.  Thanks info. still pretty absurd bars open Miami! closed whole city Oakland cases much lower Florida. 

It looks like Florida New York closed city, coffin trucks parked outside hospitals two weeks later. fear come home town. =[ headline peak 2020. RN higher level nursing LPN? thought LPN's allowed write prescriptions RN's weren't. primary care provider LPN great. long term minor annoying issue doctors stumped many years. mentioned LPN knew immediately treat it, mystery solved. figured came contact dumb basic stuff fancier MD's do.

(edit:) Correction thanks responders below: Nurse Practitioner (NP) LPN. got confused. Thanks. without giving adequate notice something people could press court though. doubt Disney dumb enough leave loophole. Ottawa Public Health announced similar measure today comes effect tomorrow. Yeah! 5 day week COVID parties!!! /s firm scientific data rather hurt feelings play politics...  add wearing seat belts killed lot people still parts world people refuse wear find loophole around (sitting self wearing cops nearby commonly live, using absurd amount window tint cops can’t see). saying beginning rise again? Prison outbreak SC. 124 inmates tested positive Spartanburg.  won’t feel different son high risk can’t catch this. hope nobody dies anymore period cases can’t go deaths follow appropriate percentage . keep popping up??? Prior holiday weekend deaths flat week week basically bottomed - begin tick shortly. 

Also - people think 50k cases day plays out? would hit 60k+ holiday weekend barring sort surprises could easily hit 75k week. - ask - people expect cases play out??? see since cough linger weeks cold. Still, 2 weeks symptoms showing, I'm going near anyone. first second people? think?

/s Testing improved, need suffocating get one. positives caught much earlier stage symptoms. Parents need protest in-person instruction. Leaders pushing law says students in-person least sometime order receive funding leaders still pushing in-person teaching fall. crazy. Oh shut gimp Well, clearly know much ruling party India right now. Hindu version CCP boy PM loves PR. managed politicise every Indian institution, including armed forces elections. party actively pushes pseudoscience name Hindu nationalism. 
India like America institutions independent. I'm sad say ICMR (India's FDA equivalent) take part PR project important state election coming needs something showcase. Somehow, that’s figured you’d say. It’s 95% head. You’re cause thoughts. 
Take break news. Let go world little. Thank that, people jump conclusions. entire sub today's episode stuff known publically made available since March.... happened Northern Italy hospitals overwhelmed. blame them? supposed know? Also, makes likely spread you’re presymptomatic, since asthma coughs still cause spray around respiratory droplets you’re infected presymptomatic, dangerous around you. say asthmatic myself, isn’t unreasonable scary people around Well terrifying legislating reasonable amount sick leave? actually outbreak

And probably infrastructure place (due SARS) detect early on. sounds like great thing? need make sure everyone gets money survive fun although jpbs automated. recall correctly, states recognize law degree bar purposes x amount delivered online. I'm fairly certain NY one example. report published 2016 Journal Chinese Medical Association found evidence 1918 virus imported Europe via Chinese Southeast Asian soldiers workers instead found evidence circulation Europe pandemic. 2016 study suggested low flu mortality rate (an estimated one thousand) found among Chinese Southeast Asian workers Europe meant deadly 1918 influenza pandemic could originated workers. evidence disease spread Chinese workers workers entered Europe routes result detectable spread, making unlikely original 2018 study tissue slides medical reports led evolutionary biology professor Michael Worobey found evidence disease originating Kansas, cases milder fewer deaths compared infections New York City time period. study find evidence phylogenetic analyses virus likely North American origin, though conclusive.*** China's government probably feeling pretty smug now.
Having totalitarian government allowed total lockdown rest wood would accept. part says humans live healthy life. Especially USA etc. people tend eat drink (very) unhealthy, dont move enough (everything car), excluding necessary vitamines listening bodies......its Italy, dine heartily.....

Also point view eating much sugar covid ""sugar coated"", immune system doesnt recognize covid.

Though unhealthy lifestyle(s) creates change getting damaged/entered faster covid needs scientefically proven first ofcourse. I'm sorry America another way US model others countries knowing bad not, leads people taking care wearing mask. would still keep &amp; use cold/flu season. think problem we've become accustomed amazing vacations every year even couple times year. limited couple big trips every years would make big difference. Yeah likely COVID deaths. mean people really want attribute excess deaths everything raging pandemic happening. Like deaths coincidentally happened year deadly virus unleashed masses. 

Okay. Simple, yet understandable everyone family members' tests affect situation - getting least short-term fomite spread possible, family member coughing carrying unlikely - wash hands etc anyway.

If healthcare provider said 10 days enough, that's better info get reddit. many states got many things wrong. Meeting family, especially old people reckless time. Anyway, I'm ranting reckless people are. much risking family. fact relevant reasonable comment still sign they're beginning realize valid point. child, always sorry people skipping line : probably better way make regular customers HATE people wheelchair. :( 
In country, people stopped paying premium ""no line"" service hate received users, point service better time. I’m assuming means appreciable impact deaths/hospitalizations, may make bit worse make likely get pneumonia encounter cytokine storm response. Anyone else 4 months ? solid argument democracy Bollocks lol think mutation virus made dangerous, Wuhan even bats sells them. Weeeelll.  It’s entirely perfect way, lot better US, yes. Sorry loss. Speaking which, get load Karen proudly refusing wear mask Toronto hospital.  case one made family take ‘rona seriously. He’s Rock Hudson COVID-19. Refer expert terms coronavirus 

As far I've understood, spike mutation Fauci refers common one evidence (slightly) altering properties virus. simply putting jail solitary longer contagious kind kills 2 birds 1 stone not? gut feel would 9/11 blatantly horrible, tangible (everyone saw news) visible enemy made much easier put aside petty party politcs. SARS-COV-2, however, visible per se exponential growth actually starts fairly slow appear bad first. inital phase likely politicisation virus took place therefore people doubling getting worse otherwise they'd admit wrong. they'd confront wrong things it'd challenge whole world view. really don’t understand maintain legal argument 1.) don’t employ people 2.) bear responsibility passenger’s actions. might nail coffin Uber’s business model.

One hope, anyway. article looking 7-day rolling average, daily new cases. done math understanding rolling average higher every day 27 days. children love luxury; bad manners, contempt authority; show disrespect elders love chatter place exercise. Children tyrants, servants households. longer rise elders enter room. contradict parents, chatter company, gobble dainties table, cross legs, tyrannize teachers.""

Thank Russian man. would happy survived Covid, would devastated lose sense smell!! Smells evoke memories me. 😢 Anyone around sub get survive Covid? it? sub loves sensationalist... live central London, one every four pubs open. crowds see people drinking outside lot pubs allowed people drink indoors.

First corona psychos tell us single national holiday second spike, day beaches packed, (compared numbers pub goers) huge blm/anti blm protests full shouting, chanting drinking. fateful second wave events? going second wave, stop stirring shit worrying people needlessly. glad recovered nicely (I'll state obvious part : oxygen tracheostomy STILL allow risk life people around you. specific case, unable wear mask means ask service first place.) guy needs suicide watch... I'm 41, shit's hilarious. mean would job security Curious though, would different?

Under privelaged families tend less flexible work schedules, smaller homes, tighter budgets.

In context ""optional"" distance learning program families likely space home set one... much less two (if 2 kids) places allow focused effective learning, might even able stay home allow it, even may suffer financially need pay meals normally provided school need childcare.

I blown away level frustration time commitment coworkers describing kids tried utilize distance learning finish last school year. sounded like another part time job. 

At glance optional program seems good meet needs desires communities... likely end widening learning gap forcing kids/parents choose education, health, finances.

Meanwhile home... healthy, white, suburban, male... could swing easily extra rooms home, flexible work schedule available time off, pre existing exposure internet computers outside ""mobile"" format. addition stuff people said, I’m entirely sure supply lines infrastructure produce new class vaccines billions people. pretend happening. Mierdas Touch call it. believe acts made worse accidental intentional sadly who's really blame?

The people purchase companies? Well one Canadian singer died. leg amputated blood clot caused COVID so.... know. I've pretty life changing culinary experiences😂. Here's hoping better ones future. Look graph: tiny, thin lines top. carbon neutral power sources put together - nuclear, solar, wind, etc.

6% total. 6%! fossil fuel use continues grow exponentially, renewables grow somewhat faster.

The amount power generated renewables doubled last twenty years. That's amazingly fast, we'd _four times_ produce world's energy - that's eight years.

The world's governments would aggressively push this. People would give great deal lifestyles.

Dude healthy place like NYC ..he likely got high viral load .. especially masks beginning :-( Remember next time want go cruise. Hit care. Depends state.... (and wife) fought hard long. really really sad. terrifying 41 Broadway must great condition. Anyway, truly sad think anyone heard story feels family tonight. i'll b efine tho ways. saying. Even right, pandemic taught anything tht it'll happen WAAAAAAAYYYYY slower thought weird unrelated things unexpected effects (both good bad) considered. say sit back, relax watch burn that's whats actually happening, yet try enjoy good times here. Wear mask, stay healthy stay safe fellow redditor. Where’s “but *insert preexisting condition here*” make feel safe?? Exact boat I'm appalled amount families turning private tutors private schools alternative. going absolutely affect kids home watching TV day. wish started working back April knew still going problem think already missed boat.  Best case point put anyone means go virtual find way help means. Gonna pretty awkward confirmed. already reports showing [cases identified early December. [genome showed that's NY cases came from. Another [report shows traces virus water samples Barcelona March. worked perfectly. Well done job government case. pop put nowhere, U.S. laboratory. rush say there's evidence. There's evidence words too. know CDC monitors respiratory disease, right? bunch people come respiratory symptoms progression unlike flu anyone living seen, attendings aren’t gonna miss that. Especially sick folks common exposure.

So yeah, it’s possible, definitely slim side possible. ""The state’s statistics show infection rates declined after social distancing stay-at-home orders took effect, emerging research indicates masking orders also help slow spread vaccine discovered.""

* Anyone who's close contact (including family living them) employees need quarantine unless subsequently get tested test positive

* Contact tracing goes back back two days prior onset symptoms, even contact known positive significantly prior (and knowing take 14 days symptoms show spread even never show symptoms)


Every single one steps inadequate city/county really cared stopping spread virus. seem think positive test makes contagious, rather infected virus. Honestly. it’s media hoax. Literally dude anime porn twitter tell it’s fake.

Also, buy 10-year-old used car great shape less months pay usually (source: done 4 times myself), gas maintance insurance expensive part.

The world already decided fake. hiding covid-19? am. reason simple: high chance death virus. 

I reminded risk last week report New York City health department Columbia University estimated average, March May, chance dying get infected SARS-CoV-2 1.45%.

That’s higher lifetime chance getting killed car wreck. That’s every driver cutting off, every corner taken fast, every time nearly dozed highway, crammed one. That’s disease want get. someone mother’s age, chance death came 13.83% ranged high 17%. That’s roughly 1 6, chance you’ll lose Russian roulette. That’s game want mother play. We've tracked hundreds infections bars. Florida 10,000 cases. YESTERDAY. bars definitely problem, clearly biggest spreaders. He's total neolib Kellyanne called. hospitals full treatment. Would never pass court muster

Maybe cant know tested. Requiring risk harm others way consistent limitations freedom. drive car 85 back street, probably wont hurt anyone else still arent free take chances people's lives. would sitting waiting room 16 hours!!!

/s maybe already multiple thousand die 

oh wait bad I’m r/coronavirus south handled badly, northeast angel states reacted perfectly pandemic

not like deaths per capita long shot anything r/LegalAdvice might able help you. nearly victim serial murder rapist. father killed mother. divorced fraudulent, deadbeat, abusive ex.

I know behavior.

I get point, though, talk people see behavior ask aware coming across. Twenty-five percent don't. Seventy-five percent aware drive point home abuse.

So, close quarters long time. know looks like. wreckless disregard welfare others. Complete total belligerence unwillingness even smallest thing get society economy back track?

Yup. troubling indicators. everyone staying home. wife went hospital, went walk doctor waited 3 hours say can't give antibiotics (pneumonia) without rona test takes 2-5 days hospital 45 minutes go got they're put test xray see pneumonia believe sends home scripts antibiotics, pharmacy fill yet. No, perfectly healthy. rtPCR pretty run-of-the-mill molecular biology technique. would learned went route. We're definitely introverted say Finland. They're masters social distancing since they've always done it. America much outward appearance. Like many cars insane amounts crazy bumper stickers. Canada that's pretty uncommon benign things like ""I dog"" ""my fav sports team"" political shit. sneaky suspicion he's serious. Honestly? vaccinations. vaccinated pretty thoroughly.

But going get covid one, last immediately. simply trust things rushed first market. want see customer feedback first. “security” won’t enough. even tip ice berg. Covid isn’t apocalypse. It’s catalyst apocalypse. I’ve already said that.  get looted anything value taken you. Including holes. So. it. may free super shitty. dont money, family bring meals, blankets, pay bribe money better care. One city 80k people 2 ventilators. volunteer get firefighter training firefighters. compulsory way. Yes, case demonstrates COVID worst - taking 41-year-old healthy person gruesome 3-month death process. Although common, are, unfortunately, many cases amputations due COVID. Survival rates improving, people still dying. can't guarantee would lived he'd contracted later. Time take away freedom they've saying taken away. What’s cost? Patients typically given blood thinners expected hospitalized bedridden reduce risk blood clots. standard hospitals way covid thing. literally people working around clock long term plan said, working vaccine. meantime, prevent people getting wearing masks. slow spread people don’t needlessly die icu beds available them. Man that’s rough. :/

The diet basically eliminating problematic foods like processed carbs processed sugars, focusing anti-inflammatory foods like berries, greens, seafood fatty acids etc. dont see difference access dozens machines perform various functions paying one piece equipment? Wait... mean support choice now? subject? tier university? important factors. adjunct I've different experience. It’s possible, it’s also possible started earlier China reported, arrived Italy earlier reported, Spanish test false positive. 

But say, it’s clear didn’t start wildlife market it’s likely SARS didn’t either. know virus breaks really well meat-packing plants, China’s wildlife markets exact cold temperature humid conditions those. Stay home, wear mask need leave. Blow reps phone telling gov needs step in. Severe Pandemic Live?

 

It takes bit time load hard navigate mobile, however, hover county US see risk level. child special needs well without regular routine therapies services, may different spot many parents. talk lives lost, seen statistics injuries permanent disability. remember early days, western world thought easy spread Asian population. horrible. think medical community disservice reason told wear masks begining shortages. allowed people become infected, hospitalized. system nearly strained maybe could looking like EU curve we're seeing. care happens them. little. late. baked point, sad say. understand trump turning advantage? told everyone mask social distance, invested testing tracing, he'd probably thing control November would hard beat scenario. 

This whole Mount Rushmore optional social distancing masks pushes whole thing chaos makes re-election less likely. want win?? base would follow where's political danger?

I'm getting it. Yes ""MAGA"" kept internal. can't drive state lines even going Legal CA Legal OR. work UW opening usual. department keeping classes entirely online fall canceling summer courses. Yet another one dangerous messages spread "" kids unscathed COVID-19"". remember correctly Rand Paul claiming barely affects children. Even inflammatory syndrome cases enough make patients take every precaution. true - flu shot encouraged even non-vulnerable populations. way stop spread vaccinating enough accomplish herd immunity. That's generally 70-80% range - US would require \~250M vaccinations. Considering younger people experiencing severe complications despite lower fatality rate, something anyone bypassing unless they're medically unable take vaccine. lots reasons test person. 

Such as? shy. 

Testing extremely important, especially contact tracing. There's reason test. 

You preach ""medical standpoint"" yet go testing. seriously doubt say. Florida Texas maxing hospital beds

Yeah, worried me, impossible tell substance what's going on. know they're hospitalizing lot people asymptomatic precaution. really difficult tell things. media atrocious depicting accurate pictures usually interest. People access testing

Im assuming access steadily increasing every day last 4 months. Pretty easy make one already source code. China hide hundreds thousands deaths? China saying dangerous jump would honest death totals Sorry wrong attitude. matters much vote sways election direction, whether tell opinion not. 

Democracy based single votes decisive. based whether people voice opinion. voice opinion (i.e. vote) democracy stops working. Think like this: 1% vote, nobody knows 99% think. Nobody address needs wishes. possible contain virus. lockdown entire planet duration one infection cycle.

Somehow feed people.... sustain them. (Not sure who...because everyone locked down.)

A countries could eradicate close boarders forever. would work.

See, I'm realist.  love enthusiasm. possible... never happen.  Protesters (on either side), rule breakers, kids, schools, disease treatment (for diseases) .... list endless.

Yes, wear mask, wash hands, unnecessary contact... serve help hospitals medical professionals.  mistake general solution 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! Plus Jefferson suggested constitution re-examined every 19 years. Think would like that? 2nd amendment abortion legal constitutional level? good quote, even close relevant case. We’re pretty well Michigan. Bars closed SE MI holiday weekend decent outbreak bar Lansing. think could keep numbers low mandatory mask wearing indoor outdoor public spaces except smaller restaurants keep getting cases. think virus probably airborne expect confirmed sometime near future. don’t think full shutdown necessary case also don’t think stand alone bars, gyms movie theaters going open time soon here. State run casinos closed tribal casinos open month well. Temp checks door, masks required, exceptions smoking. Mandatory masks key slowing even stopping virus imo. don’t believe we’ll see vaccine time soon instead hoping effective treatment. needs lung, brain, kidney, liver, heart anus transplant whew Press F respects Alexa play Despacito Go look Iran. resurgence infection took 4-6 weeks start see reflected death rate. Deaths USA start climb shortly.  Sorry 😢 Hentai die. need really big sample people know sure. 5000 people testing Oxford vaccine Brazil give time, track patients. spill propaganda 'college necessary'

Well since know much it, tell everyone US corporations hire someone career-track professional position require degree. I'm talking job trades sales, require one get least bachelor's degree requirement promotion. Take time. anecdote means something ton people spreading propaganda masks cause harm people dying pre existing conditions old. I’m saying you’re one people, result normal people like start saying stuff like “there likely unknown compounding factor here” feeling normalized, even though it’s literally impossible make kind blanket statement like talking Novel pathogen. Maybe pre existing condition, maybe virus mutated, maybe got concurrent infection MRSA hospital. thing really know sure it’s Coronavirus, masks help, respirators help even more, staying inside avoiding human contact much possible helps. Everything else debatable. Mortality, Morbidity, even transmission Airborne vs Droplet debatable. It’s really hard kind research it’s unethical illegal experiments involving purposely attempting infect test subjects. somehow people taken things know works turned partisan shit show 

Also 200 million people 50 America, .05% 100,000 people

Completely ridiculous article. almost suggesting viruses pop nowhere. referring incident 1918 flu supposedly isolated community infected. well clearly suggests isolated?! Definitely suggest viruses mysteriously pop put nowhere.

China fight put much disinformation possible suggest come China. vote Chinese propaganda oblivion.

Healthy young adults also much less likely require hospitalization; it’s like 20% 20-40 year olds infected COVID need admitted hospital. 1918 Flu pandemic really bad took healthy young adults 20’s 30’s instead children elderly; simply case COVID. Plus *way* Americans 1918 course we’ll way deaths.

Unfortunately, problem recent SCOTUS decision allowing funding religious schools, end result probably shrinking public school system. Yes even lots hesitation caveats. Unfortunately evidence effectiveness still unclear countries mandate mask use still growth communal spread countries don’t virus contained vice versa. 

The US excellent example mask recommendations may still negative outcome overall transmission rates. go pub please? It’s possible. Haven’t seen infection stats age range. picked order Cheesecake factory today Friendswood, restaurant almost completely full. people masks employees. looked around, shook head went get food. Welcome Texas Lol, that’s awesome. It’s good thing it’s never hot cold never rains it’s always quite outside. 

Honest question. flipping difference make hold classes outside students living, walking eating together? number deaths 130k couple days now? sources saying 132k work Canada nooooo way hell anyone company gets overtime. comes COVID think guys ones worse us. Congrats. reference proper definition, did, that's that. work usa remember record extra hours working home. Even paid salary usa must pay overtime unless truly carved management position.
you may never claim get laid 4 weeks might want think it. work healthcare astounded many nurses think bullshit. Like, agree virus real represents serious risk think basic infection control measures inconvenient overreaction. 

I lost faith profession time. I've watched places write great policies combat spread spend thousands dollars protect staff patients alike, pack hundred people shoulder shoulder hallway line testing. 

I've watched signs go building mandating &lt;5 people offices break rooms pack everyone management room twice weekly meetings. We're risking every department head becoming infected, imagine outbreak leadership?

One really irritates keep everyone separated least 6 ft meals etc preacher come gathers everyone small chapel ""church"". count religious, apparently. 

I could go on. insanity extremely frustrating.  people work with. get news Facebook I’m like really. FL way blue idiot conservative retirees killing deep need trigger libs. one thank removing say country run. wish selfishness cause others become infected die. said that? said welcome club. commiserate together... intelligent, well-thought-out response fueled hatred kind. employers might look good thing didn’t give up

Won't matter dead friend. Or, pittance victory infect friends family. He’s director NIAD since days Reagan Truth hurts. people believe stop testing virus mean virus went away everything go back way before. sure would get crazy idea like that...it's like leader country spitting message every opportunity 24/7 propaganda channel keeps beating drum reinforcing message... classic argument- strong immune system help beat Covid19 - flawed reason: Research observations indicate die strong immune response. Anti-vaxxers promoting argument isnt correct. 

Vit. helps moderate response helpful. also novel virus propensity causing extreme blood clotting anomalies. dont think evidence showing clotting issue possible result cytokine storm, complicated it. still dangerous pathogen, matter slice people cannot rely mere nutritional approaches. 

Interventions specified experts natural anti-vaxxer strategy- *just dont get spit everything everybody-* Keep spit house, dont spit others public, dont cross contaminate surfaces spit on, dont let aerosolized spit circulate AC. stopping spit. Honestly anyone family experiences symptoms, we're getting tested can't afford Fuck tragic. day UK ceases free healthcare day know doomed. flying fuck already thing, everywhere? come every presidential candidate, worldwide, ride delivering one thing?

you may never claim get laid 4 weeks might want think it. Makes sense would drive numbers too. much impartial journalism Really? Last Sunday record high lol Eh, let dumb ones suffer kill (looking Karens too). Darwinism works. Anybody bothered mask can't wear one valued member society. Gonna get downvoted harsh truth. feel like 50% bit high experience, yes agree adhering social distancing rules careful. also know long vaccine immunity last. There's still lot unknowns, including we'll vaccine enough doses actually anything towards herd immunity. could looking 6 months 2 years.

But much agree mask wearing mandate either states US government, I'm still going wear one needed I'm going go rally thousand people understand idea distancing. cost insulin too. high percentage diabetics cutting dosage order make ends meet. worse, covids-19 much bigger threat diabetics anyone else 80s.

If high deductible plan also HSA like flex spending account don’t lose money don’t spend year. put difference premiums high deductible plan next tier HSA every paycheck. paycheck healthcare deduction paying next tier healthcare bills paid straight using credit card. don’t even keep receipts anything, automatically. part accepted gamble? knew running league control pandemic, expected. thinking - NYC might protected fact still lockdown, thousands came lot infected. Whereas Texas, open month chances lot infected people crowds NY's terrible misconception. COVID-19 kills healthy people. Maybe one maybe didn’t immediate reactionary assumption dangerous thinking. meant disease conspiratorial mindedness yea diease dude. safe brother!!

Feel like we've shared little part story Love easily people love throwing away freedom little bit security. don’t force people wear masks normal flu season, would save lives wouldn’t mandate? Last checked, deaths nosediving US even cases going healthy young population. people want avoid catching virus, isolate home. 99.8% population won’t die coronavirus allowed make choice whether wear mask. Downvote want, everyone thinks forced wear masks. I'd go far say people insisted big deal communication circles flip story, go silent. that's irks me.

Fuck living Toronto. Ain’t me. schrodinger's cat vaccine. Well, wear mask even taking walk outdoors, epidemiologists tell priority 1. Check episode Factually epidemiologist want hear what's less big co-morbidities? one corona case one corona case march. stupid compare two rate testing, sample size testing, quality testing vastly different.

We even know much virus mutated. 

At peak, 2000 people use die per day Tri-state area alone. Florida, roughly population seeing 1/80th death rate (and florida enough lagging cases 2 weeks old counter 'death lagging indicator' argument).

SIP ain't happening strain COVID. closing certain type events business Must nice. Congrats Toronto Cannot ignore obviously good news. question though primarily changes criterion “Covid Death” making count seem lower, secondarily fact new surge cases ramped quickly perhaps we’re see deaths upcoming week attributed surge.

Either way, let’s remain optimistic people aren’t dying rate NYC faced surge cases. lol gods plan I’m sure 🙄 I’m well way.

Nobody scared sobbing mom last minute consciousness placed induced coma. tear jerking facetime good byes, pictures people dying alone. Yet Americans still talk free. going listen propaganda. manipulated. 

This horror show country, filled despicable, shitty people. Lol pandemic arrived basically time US Canada. Yesterday, US reported 57,000 new cases Canada reported 300 new cases. that’s even taking account Canada testing aggressively US putting barriers testing. retirement home (Assisted living facility) grandmother cases, took precautions, PPE ass, visitors allowed ALL, staff, Grandmother contracted COVID, asymptomatic, result complications involved, died COVID. 

The retirement communities going death factories FL. Masks infringe freedom surgeon general said masks don’t work. talked people know went private school. self went public exclusive school none us know school student perform janitorial service US. curious talking charter school fully private school? Also state? Virus mutate jumps one animal another mutation. Truthfully viruses would unknown origins could mutate several times overseas finally able infect humans.

It unlucky. Hell virus could reach stage human infection several parts world final stage infection would differ slightly. even come fully human infection one first mutation starts. 

Timing unlucky. Ugh terrible , horrible way go. May Rest Peace. I’m Muscle Shoals cut ties lot family they’re handling speaking it. It’s another loss due pandemic. sucks, worry them, can’t carry psychic weight interacting them.

I'm surprised took long get point. thought south frats??? mean issue America specifically high rate rejection risk becoming endemic, 75% may enough herd immunity, 25% wont die off, disease deadly that.

It's crazy Brit see kind sentiment openly expressed, figure too. imagine we'll highest rejection rate Europe i'd shocked even came 10% Stop making sure virus not! It’s frustrating hearing “well don’t many cases state open” argument. forgot AZ, TX, Florida one point 0 cases?

Crazy happens u listen people spent life's learning shit people read something Facebook. what's point comparison? mind asking. break dude move on. lurked post history saw post mad wearing masks public. seem like smart good person. fact isnt willing support stand decisions pandemic belittles taking basic precautions cool. deserve better! Also good job tomatoes! Locking 100 new cases prevent 100 becoming 11,000. more. China would locked dozen, dozen easily becomes couple hundred time work case management. 

If there's one thing virus shown, speed need. We’ve actually increased precautions cases go down.

Which exactly keep things flat. many morons acting like go right back doing. Americans? Unified? Ha! one single solitary thing universe Americans unified on. Absolutely nothing. Apparently around that’s call “freedom”. work phrasing, leading ""to fair"" makes sound like touting defense opening bar. point reason US worse outbreak countries isn’t fault people, rather structural problems society

Bingo.

A lot people sub see masks silver bullet kill virus, they're not. great job reducing transmission, masks alone work.

Look UK. one rule mask wearing, one. must worn public transport. Even enforced. need masks go supermarket shopping centre clothes store etc. cases still declining.

I wish wear masks UK, I'm sure USA.

Theres something makes sense here. circulating long ago, cases suddenly spike? look actual infections deaths, seems reasonable originated china spread italy (and south korea iran) around january/february rest world. 

Given fierce outbreaks despite lockdowns imposed, cannot understand virus could circulate months without causing damage. didnt really see large increase deaths tons people hospitalized big outbreaks. 

For me, theory earlier spread virus originating china needs adress issues. could virus spread around globe months without much problem suddenly blow different places rapid succession? Same. know single person caught They're coming around lately, pushing narrative *months*. consistently, mind you, [a lot big names were, long Rofl live downtown Chicago. single protestor wearing masks. looters though lol  WhatsApp singled handedly biggest reason lot problems India today.

Also, think people might reading BLM Black Lives Matter Bureau Land Management, clearly talking context   I'm saying wrong - science proven wrong. even close something would considered 'right'.

The point vaccination pinpoint risk populations protect them, limit spread virus. dependent concept herd immunity, basis Sweden's failed experiment. figured - isolate vulnerable, let rest go business, herd immunity would reached point overall mitigation steps need taken (distancing, mask wearing, contact tracing) would become irrelevant.

It never happened, nobody come close herd immunity natural terms. Spain, Italy, NY. Antibodies last long enough, they're developed widely enough.

So approach 'let's let third need most' gets nowhere. virus still spreads. People still get sick, requiring time work, medication hospitalization. belief main concern fatality rate idiotic, belief anyone thirty somehow untouchable virus misguided.

There's nothing inherently 'high risk' life. choose stick head sand believe can't addressed, that's you. people seen polio, smallpox, measles essentially eradicated - handled too. done piecemeal, small sample size approach though. suffering - economic health based - continue people get idea either going mitigated vaccinated away. normal viruses floating around detection.

#Professor infectious disease physician Björn Olsen believes mistake - opposition critical.

#- chosen work different way, says Ella Bohlin (KD), Regional Care Council.

The government recently commissioned Public Health Authority support regions expand infection tracking [contact tracing], summer, state sent SEK 5.9 billion regions increased testing infection tracking.


In parts country, infection tracking units formed DN noticed, among things, Region Kalmar built central infection tracking team.


But largest worst affected region, Stockholm region, active, centralized infection detection. Instead, largely patients found infected contact people risk virus.


 - chosen work different way. find strategies utilize information infected people give us. form infection-tracking work, ”says Ella Bohlin (KD), Regional Care Council.


The left health care spokesman Jonas Lindberg critical. believes symptom region's health care apparatus equipped pandemics easily overloads.


- resources put infection tracking - performed health care professionals, says Jonas Lindberg, thinks would advisable employ extra personnel dedicated solely infection tracking.


- Unloading responsibility individual means cannot say engaged active infection tracking. 

The World Health Organization, , made early recommendation test, trace isolate get control infection. public health authority abandoned strategy became social spread March, state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell said would waste resources try find cases - important focus need care.

**But government wants regions expand testing infection tracking push epidemic. Transferring responsibility infection detection patient live guidelines May year**, Ekot first report. 

#Björn Olsen, professor infectious diseases Uppsala University, believes mistake active infection detection Stockholm.

- know organization Stockholm looks like, able put hand it. know areas spread greatest, exclusion areas, epidemic could brought down.


According him, Stockholm region could “hit two flies one fell swoop” employ unemployed people infection tracers. Olsen believes infection detection important people infected developed symptoms quarantined pass disease.


- plenty unemployed people could trained become contact tracers. would allowed take samples dig infection chains. get rid infection way, time reduce unemployment, would fantastic.


**Infection tracing would particularly important socially vulnerable areas**, says Maria Albin, professor Institute Environmental Medicine Karolinska Institute. co-author study covid-19 hits million program areas particularly hard. Järva area belongs districts Stockholm region highest number deaths covid-19 relative population, according figures region.


- fact people expected take responsibility tested risks leading underestimation spread infection. clear individuals families different conditions undertake testing, even free.


The Health Development Region Council Ella Bohlin (KD) emphasizes Stockholm expanded testing made infection tracking efforts geriatrics.


- true Stockholm infection tracking team traveling around, individual efforts in, example, geriatrics similar work. also two teams underway support infection tracking. huge region. smaller regions easier get appliance.


- definitely best testing. first strategy everyone test free antibodies virus, says Ella Bohlin.

The state money testing infection tracking paid retrospect. know much Stockholm Region ask for, compensation based many tests done.


Ella Bohlin says leaning experts' advice: 


- Public Health Authority great support, Smittskydd Stockholm Per Follin expert knowledge guiding decisions.


Region Stockholm's infection control physician Per Follin told DN infection tracking resource-intensive would difficult present still community spread.


Have chosen central active infection detection financial reasons?


- No, say that. must clear purpose relevance know work. various care areas work actively infection detection, says Ella Bohlin.


Social Minister Lena Hallengren (S) comments Stockholm decision:


""I assuming regions scaling work based needs look like taking help Public Health Authority work increase testing infection detection,"" writes DN.

I’m afraid it’s going backfire, even less help next time businesses closed. Great news! should’ve easy slam dunk administration. could even make tidy profit maga masks. failed even that. 540k fatality rate. Think outcomes, 540k people died, 6,570k recovered. That's 8.1% fatality rate. Granted many people go undiagnosed without symptoms.  That’s also point... (and thank comment)... don’t know they’ll nail it, will. supposed actually things jacked til then?! Current situation sustainable socioeconomic state. Well fair it’s uncommon electors go vote area, think it’s happened twice get used mask within days. Remind protect others. remind way earth leaves house without mask vaccine. get less social interaction homeschooled. Maybe I'm crazy feeling covid deaths reported. Cases easy report - people get tested tests get reported, cause death manipulated: cardiac arrest rather cardiac arrest caused covid. incredibly suspicious daily deaths low cases continue explode. comment made imagine licking teeth.  Worse that. naturally occurring. much generated released air one place, actually influence weather. Entire cities wiped map it. teens think fun games, practically bathe stuff. Get two birds stoned infectious measles, dangerous, measles vaccines. Right. That's implying. new studies/evidence Vitamin supplementation immune health?

Is true oral supplementation Vitamin takes least month build get blood? Gotta love right **All comments political. post political!** I’m sure find members represent given state, there’s almost 600 them, doubt anybody could name couple, all. I’m viewing angle Australian; we’ve almost eliminated covid19 although new outbreak 200 new cases day.  

The US response awful protests aren’t bad terms pandemic response. outside daylight hours, wearing mask - protesters wore masks - pretty much safest aren’t sheltering home.

Yes protests spiked infected numbers. *nearly* much reopening bars, gyms, resteraunts, indoor businesses. flU A!! 



flU A!! 



flU A!! 



We're number 1 People mass travel NH wearing masks go hiking know hike, unfortunately run trails ask leads go, get lost hike, often hike answer really....smh Probably hurt afterwards, too. Everyone loves red panda. Scotland working it! He's let politics take seat focus task hand. breathe fresh air see things get politicized. aH kNoW mUh RiGhtS!! DiScrImINaTiOn!!

Right I'm physical therapist assistant making 50k, little room growth, I'm thinking career change. working knowledge building computers BS (exercise science). I've researching CCNA good starter material, couple quick questions ask you. jobs titles could get gaining CCNA? scarce? Salary range? advice studying certification? career paths CCNA,CCNP , anything else? What's day-day job like? Sorry questions I'm curious, change careers want make sure towards something growth. they're earlier diseases cycles since herd immunity drops time new folks born older immune folks died. Also primarily childhood diseases reason. sure polio, others. all. think threshold herd immunity less. Recall spikes measles cases due anti vaxers. drops herd immunity percent think enough effect. really conspiracy theory. wiv modifying bat coronaviruses like one also happened infect people ace2 receptor. Along paper read regarding pseudovirus employed HIV. sur coincidence virus broke near wiv. surprised remember start pandemic chinese authorities admitted guess came seafood wetmarket. soon even chinese researchers wondered origiated another place third people infected virus time went near seafood market. Also many reputable people spoken said believe came lab. may “enough disposable bodies” waiting take place dead/disabled *now*. 

But know ended serfdom / feudalism 13th century? Plague. 

Eventually, Lords couldn’t get enough serfs bidding. Serfs premium commodity began demand change exchange labor. 

Could one “silver linings” insanely ill-managed massive dark cloud. 

🍀🤞🙏🤞🍀 understand.

Why think presence/danger virus somehow threat worldview? must close shutting certain states again. keep reading Texas, Florida, Arizona officials breaking point.

Millions lives stake here. No, none studies said that. said cloth masks less effective surgical masks.

None compared surgical *or* cloth masks mask-less. blindly stating authors agree you.

Which scientific. Mexican presidents allowed serve one six-year term. Around 5.5k new cases, 16 new deaths. still get fogging tightly sealed n95. Hot air rises. way completely get rid valved mask, protect others well. fair, promptly removed hospital. Masks indoors mandatory starting tomorrow (July 7th)--hopefully stores take enforcement seriously. Could compared fart physics? google that, read news spreading virus farts.

I feel like people familiar farts, could educational bridge. **All comments political. post political!**  Every time meeting annoying parent asks teachers health conditions supported work home. swear looks could kill admin would dead now. nightmare Fall would grateful. i’d honestly never complain anything else going something like  Spread far wide! caregiver know trying post Facebook Facebook removed it, crazy? less crappy masks small filters better. filter air coming one-way filter filter air exhaled. Unfortunately, become accustomed seeing large numbers even phased. long break 10 Million cases 500,000 cases day (already breaking 150K) . I'm also reminded former FDA head said real new daily cases probably ten times reported number. lockdown efforts completely wasted

the Bay Area seeing anything close LA is.. 

this Newsom also destroying sales platform masks. Police strongly anti mask pandemic probably thought favor. **All comments political. post political!** We're separate countries, heads state happen biological person California ton money early keep numbers sustainable This. Businesses cannot operate half full. It’s financially feasible. Better stay closed. Welcome world new grads. God depressing. finally gave ghost ended membership today. haven’t since February holding hope I’d able go back soon. try go since reopened. Went “off” time way many people. think official end yet vaccine required, would expect fall 2021 absolute earliest anyone could think campus. Meanwhile school board posted Virginia Department Education resume car drivers ed classes immediately. Yeah.

""Instuctor student must wear masks"". Uh huh, still enclosed car together. 3 million *confirmed* cases. true number probably much higher, number consists people felt reason tested. There's probably thousands asymptomatic people sitting home (or not) zero idea it. /r/drumpfisfinished hot spot, cases. Schools super super modified. Alternating cohorts students, universal masking, full online vulnerable teachers students stay home.  Woooosh thing say objectivity anti-racist protesters per capita masked open-up protesters (and latter came earlier). rest, there's always spin present one degree another. bigger news!? could really useful. information would helpful. Others too. Serum institute India producing it, contracted 1 billion doses AstraZeneca, whatever means. said screw went got exposed, hospitals would overrun thousands hundreds thousands would die due lack treatment.

I cannot imagine richest country world choosing let people die massive scale. people like roaming around ending anytime make go faster full force like America.

Here Czechia, cancelled mandatory wearing mask six days ago. Still getting around 30-70 infected 0 (rarely 2) dead daily country 10 million population.

I'd still wear though, sounds like latest covid news say mortality rate directly covid consequential causes started covid. new estimate 200k. seems accurate. Makes sense Florida new York blaming other. set people many cases. must cooperate enforce quarantine/travel bans two areas going stop this. Same. kid isn’t school, that’s one seat social distancing, one less strain teachers forced there. know everyone it, can, — protects us others. Admittedly, I’m lucky child responds well learning home. Same. pass someone small space quickly, even I'm wearing mask. Imagine Trump De Santis black face photos surface, think people would ignore story give pass?

Trump's base would certainly give pass Uh well people show protest alone, meet friends, make signs, etc. say protest warn directly around. (Yeah shit Sherlock gonna know 50,000 people protest) also mass warnings whole city protesters get tested/quarantine hotspot appears. trapping bando? moving bricks crew? fall chart? I'm assuming park make visitors sign waiver absolving Disney liability? Yep, bars indoor dining even open yet Ontario.  visiting wife, reuniting household isolate due Sophie catching covid-19. Also cottage 20km away, metropolitan area. horrible perhaps it'll give us tidy death rate extrapolate numbers fudged... Damn. cousin pregnant hoping get married baby born, saw writing wall cancelled it. Thanking lucky stars selfless sensible enough keep us home. company nearing end lease. considering moving getting larger space. we're considering smaller space.  :) schools opening *early* (Tennessee) couple weeks. masks required. area, cases higher ever deaths starting happen again. Nope, invited head government. Elizabeth II head state, there's chance putting sort nonsense either. Ontario today first day since March 28 recorded deaths. We've improving initial shitshow long term care homes. can't let America ruin progress. really sure asking then. asking public transparency president's medical records without access medical records. point, trusting system still functional appropriate parties invoke section 25th necessary.

This certainly abused (see Woodrow Wilson's stroke) measure citizens elect people uphold Constitution vote blatantly disregard it. zero faith administration GOP led Senate another oversight committee answer since rife corruption mention rely White House actually openly give information (proven impossible Trump).

We need vote better type person hold higher standard office. Well, hard otherwise fix stupid. 

Sorry, come on. issue. People problems understanding basic biology. even get main score beat world War 2 death toll 400k Well made scientific one freedom one. 

No one's freedoms hindered wearing mask. 

If anything would bolstered things would able open giving freedom choice go. Instead dummies wear masks ""mY fReEdOmS"" bars restaurants closing many states. increased unemployment running out, convenient. outbreaks occur, managed controlled. done present. Imo majority country need masks. Well good lasted... good luck bit joke B.C. even water cooler conversation, except make fun pseudo-americans east us. said, live lower mainland, non trivial oil gas development north. Support separation may non-zero, I'd surprised even 1%. I'd investing PAPR. City guelph already since mid june guys threesome? goes show Canada allowed travel European Union United States banned traveling like shitholecountries ad Trump calls them, Trump standards America shithole country using source months old. Try something recent ever evolving situation.

Beyond that, source someone reason want population driven system failure driven. 

Be critical sources. I'll keep buying milk bags Wild. Absolutely wild. think playing chicken FL see moves first? Hooray, still lead!


flU A, flU A, flU A!!!!!! don’t blame people wary fast-tracked vaccine. wonder. much general anti-vaccine sentiment? Anyhow, I’d probably give shot myself. Healthy, kids (and plans any), etc. vaccine generate immune response negative way could actively make exposure virus worse. important make sure vaccine causing response want. excited oxford Pfizer Vaccines hope make trials successfully. Spain one largest outbreaks Europe antibodies 5% population. 

That bode well. dump him, he's misguided. pandemic break people's brains trying cope this, wrong media throw gas fire. 

 Unsolicited advice: quarantine instead. Sigh. I’ll take 90% refund thanks. correct - Fauci referring people getting infected says clearly, patients appropriate word choice. OP used patient incorrectly title post, Fauci God takes care fools babies. painful living fear, it?  say Yes. think anyone brain give photo ops next four month. Florida manipulating COVID data months. don’t trust Florida governor one bit wife gets drunk beats kids hhmmm.. here. Makes sense. Hopefully helps. shit write us bullshit made up. hope they’re wrong

They won’t be, I’m tired Okay maybe rethink electoral college know unmasked, extended, indoor, close quarters situations associated far viral spreading anything outdoors. know bars open closed again. We’ve seen crowds, it’s big secret what’s happening point. No, known weeks Nick's amputation. posted news happened. switched all. grim stuff.

I would imagine, next kin coma, would authorise operation, including double lung transplant.

I kinda felt going make tbh. god feels like millennium ago CONTROL looks like? setting great example here. poor form government. Ah bad - state property tax. Thats looking at. won’t one rona tubes over. thought breathing 100+ people’s air hours sounds nightmarish right now. Medicare seniors. Medicaid. 

If make less qualifies subsidy, would make less healthcare costs. would 100% income. 

I’ve this, personally. didn’t let finish application income low. 

The ACA website simply refers apply state’s Medicaid program. don’t live state expanded Medicaid, send list sliding scale clinics county.  would helpful separate two think that’s harder places, like US, testing practically impossible get recently even isn’t available many people. Don’t even bother. Look persons history. Driving agenda talking shit many things. We're still hoping classes cancelled closer start date. way university protect students, staff, faculty, they're relying upon students employees self check. going nightmare, rumor classes go online last minute avoid refunds. criminal endangering everyone. Oh my... sorry hear mom thinks faking it, thats fucking sad horrible. Hoping feel better beat virus without complications. &lt;3 long large pile money money value , paradise Well there's explosion New cases deaths takes three weeks that's gonna drive death rate Probably getting restaurant takeout. show up, grab it, leave. Man, care get quarterly, want vaccine soon can, miss concerts, movies football games.  100% safe ever? Driving 2x speed limit objectively less safe driving speed limit. 100% safe injury death. 

Same metaphor. distancing 5m ?? X safer?

Btw use (metres) Canadian, what’s standard USA ? 6feet? worse, wait, used tan college.. would school shooting needed save children, ""Chinese virus"" nothing wants deal Amazing! 

What bioreactor do? many US Europe? Meanwhile Florida, emergency order went REQUIRING schools open 5 days week brick mortar. Kids go back school 5 weeks. uh good luck all. connections logged audio quality-of-service purposes.

I don’t trust anything owned Chinese government. make sense? disease gotten less lethal. hospitals overwhelmed death rates likely get NYC levels. optimism good economy. possible yeah, mouth sores studied use PVP-I. counter, first aid section. brand name “betadine” generic name “Povidone Iodine”

Iodine really versatile agent — disinfects (kills viruses, fungi, bacteria) also anti-inflammatory properties. 

Note it’s super brown staining may toxic swallowed. might gross use — imagine turns teeth orange thoroughly brush whitening toothpaste. Feeling really whole thing today. talk short lived immunity vaccines need constant booster shots sounds terrible. 

And talk we’re going need basically adapt social distancing/wearing masks long term sounds miserable. I’m trying realistic imagine next time places full stadiums/arenas can’t picture we’re living world everyone needs covid shot twice year. understanding done. I'm trying create fear skepticism, simply hoping proper testing vaccines working tight deadlines. 

And think think antivaxxers antivaxxers?

Ignorance, mostly. None arguments hold water all. combination ""ooh chemical sounds scary,"" distrust science, knowing history contagious disease dangerous combination. Connecticut great though  coworker went Vegas packed bus bachelorette party. said it’s time it’s time! funny people believe huge cover-up supposedly occuring broad daylight. like one -- epidemiologists, health officials political persuasion, hell even reporter -- noticed pneumonia-reported cases really high said ""wait minute, COVID death totals must wrong."" Pro tip: noticed, that's means. Let's pretend young also barring heaviest economic cost lock downs economic downturns too. Combine already rising cost college, housing, ect, course want sort outlet. Combine fact many live families social interaction going bars clubs, surprising young people care. 

&amp;#x200B;

 prefer summer let's wait couple months jumping new year. Could also spun Canadians too. 

""Hey look prime minister big dumbass say US president"" 

Low bar still Trump lied America one lowest deaths per capita world.

Holy shit, tweets far reaching ears tweeting blatant lies persistent illegal. fuck going on?! 

Never president ever disconnected, unsympathetic unpresidential history United States. 

If cut Twitter(minimum) going make impossible US come this. 

WHAT FUCK. THIS?! People around literally want see deaths supports narrative. Kind sick. Right 3 negatives weren’t accurate single positive 100% accurate? Oh post regularly there, I’m four months sober. thanks shoutout, sub deserves exposure reasonable want proper regulatory oversight something like vaccine since researchers huge incentives get version quickly. 

The current trump admin that. governments around world will. I'll wait them. hospital patients?  needs change. I'm sure mental health professionals would willing go field loopy hell? feel like head disconnected body. able get tested today going try tomorrow. Yeah, mine letting people come back leave campus Thanksgiving. Finals bit that, seems like able done online.

Thank god graduated. ""*Summer coming, crates migrating north again*"" 99% harmless, right? Zip loc bags  Tennessee? exactly what's happening work. Yes.. seems like lot people picking choosing science agree around here. Even Fauci said schools need person IRC. 6 month old 5 year old makes SICK.... studies shown kids getting fairly unscathed 99.9% time. nervous wreck flu season well, take lightly. agree sending kids back see meaningful
Impact, move distance learning. fact remains, kids living large portion infected populace aren’t seeing disease severe subset, thankfully. anything say assholes wear masks protect old, frail, immunocompromised.  According wife, Ever heard Reagan? Nixon? Thanks pointing me! much work finding I’ll try thorough-ish response. 

As lawyer don’t consider reviews great sources. persuasive hold little authority. Consider reviews Wikipedia lawyers: it’s great place start research, can’t rely them.

That said, liked it. summarizes law pretty well (missing tests whether accommodation would require “fundamental alteration” program — example, people anxiety caused waiting lines cannot require cut front — would fundamental alteration, accommodation reasonable). However think also overemphasizes “no policy place” scenario way would confuse non-lawyers mistake “no policy place” “policy place” institution. store blanket policy masks, none considerations go matter.

It however bring lip-reading disability hadn’t considered, even correctly pointed accommodations would needed. interesting hypothetical disability would require *others* remove mask scenario initially envisioned.

Finally, respectfully disagree assertion asymptomatic individuals would qualify direct threat. base CDC guidance says asymptomatic people infect others completely undermines conclusion regarding direct threat. Additionally, administrative agencies get LOT discretion agency exempted persons, court unlikely cobble together exception.

For reason get impression law interest based fact research wasn’t attempt argue me, seems intended augment understanding expand it. That’s lawyers do. Trolls argue. strike former tried put effort response. he, though? White House infected Trumps!  Trump Kanye, Herschel Walker, Roseanne, James Woods.

We got everyone else. like chances. Given events becoming well documented large cause outbreaks, don’t know they’re small part actually. *only* contributor. think trying say one 100% certain safe distance really is. data isn’t there. So? Mad max? Sounds great!

Too bad USA corporate oligarchy Finally, research catching logic I've heard this. all. Flu vaccine changes every year flu segmented virus. SARS-COV-2 segmented virus. 

He's saying may need regular booster shots *same* vaccine rather regularly needing new vaccine. That's like chicken pox vaccine whole host vaccines. load USA people think masks key solution. would say part package fear moment USA relies masks forgets rest. hand; well USA anyway, seem get act together matter cost Now, I'm one believe stuff like know sure, honestly surprise me. NZ seems pretty fast comment mention anything passing New Zealand Ten. One make wish. account ages make highly sceptical that, though. third people go work probably love it. necks...

/r/stopdrinking help. ""People still die wearing seatbelts, they're useless!"" hold breath that. ""They seem determined protect other""

I wish case. one thing virus shown large number people simply care others. find you? call email you? kids directly? old devious kids? parents? Either way, shocking...and dangerous. give shit country yours. valid point. know cross mind time like every says protests spike case they're worried political rallies same. Liberal logic guess. They're hypocrisy showing. called indecency laws passed legislative process. executive dictate. 

If want force mask wearing, pass law. That’s America works. are! Thanks caring furry friends! Shit, least admitting fault recognizing need change. Texas, shit-show :/ think it! summer quarantine, staying home. even realize already July.  Sounds like depression hope tecate red light would thought????? Woman x beats covid also x!! Gives birth healthy upvotes. vaccine deadly people, needs tested. Also trial make sure safe works. LISTEN doctors scientists people claim know WTF talking about. Also enforcement rules would go long way too. understanding they're sitting waiting test results. Many are, ""over run"" least mean full take normal admissions. Also read first hand accounts nurses doctors Texas. never ending day rest breaks. top comment “hating cult personality” comment somrthing like lose minds lmfao mean useless distance 6 feet, still decrease viral load thus making less likely get infected Good question. know, maybe consistent wearing masks cutting viral load inside buildings. opposed here, US, seeing maybe 25% people wearing them. dumb take. vaccine ends causing irreparable damage death hundreds millions take it? First harm. Look Texas Florida, putting numbers NY put back April.

NY finally mostly open back mask/social distancing restrictions.

Unless texas Florida another 2 month shutdown get outbreak control. see happening. interesting know charged with. disagree 10-14 day incubation people already virus. Let's look stats 3 weeks. Fourth July victims. guy guess see 2 weeks.

I hear lot! talking freedom getting carrier 😣 would need wear masks daily pre-covid? Also, doctors nurses wear hospital settings everyday help protect themselves. scientific evidence? Lmao. Yeah, doctors, nurses, dentists, wear shit fashion. Gtfo. Due summer break new spam waves weekend. 90 per cent news though reported within 10 days. Yes, get similar symptoms diseases. troubles infectious thing big scale. cource traumatic impact kids. would scared mind would loose reflexes need wheelchair sudden. know difference airborne droplet live Florida. husband two sons. decided help friend need let room us get feet. decided go club party soon bars venues allowed open. entire family got sick. roughest experience. family careful, too. claimed thought would okay cause hand sanitizer everywhere. get hard people understand.. There's literally scientific evidence behind it. Literally. 


I smell cheetos here,champ! damn shame local government left alone handle pandemic. State federal leaders failed. sure death rate 1%. may beginning, better understanding virus, lessened. even 0.5% still significant. wash hands wear mask fine. 

That's still mostly true. Obviously avoiding altogether better.

Even 6 feet thing... airborne get 6 feet away, probably going get lot higher viral load right next someone it, air well droplets maybe physical touch on.

So yeah, even still, try spread out, wash hands, wear mask. give absolute immunity greatly reduce risk. try walking around naked, dressed transparent plastic clothes let us know free that.
Your condition gives right endanger people? attributed COVID-19 decreased compared last week currently epidemic threshold **but likely increase additional death certificates processed.**

Important include full sentence. Yeah fuck...that guy suffered like three months, leg cut still died. Freedom protect us! It’s really interesting surprising. Obesity linked income blacks Hispanics average make less money. question droplet size. assume air awhile, like flu. Black people getting murdered police regular basis vs. group people want served fuddruckers spread virus willy nilly. BLM protests mostly masked, reopen protests masked. intersec\*ional anti-c\*pita\*ist bent BLM protests offensive corpor\*te friendly media outlets NYT, piece allowed published. Like anti mask rally coordinator think Maryland.... got infected instead taking responsibility blamed satan. Said satan trying stop making church.

I'd file motions dismiss motions sanctions plaintiff's counsel filing frivolous suit. settle single claim. medical care. support lost person makes money.  base stick thick thin. There’s 1/3rd country support trump matter what. downplaying risk, they’re ones won’t afraid go polls Nov. needs re-elected keep enough don’t support apathetic enough stay home. don’t think that’s going hard, unfortunately. God entertaining PC lost last election going ""BUT BLACK FACE"" still got nothing ""BUT BLACK FACE"". people say free mean paid socialized medicine I.e. tax dollars. huge supporter socialized medicine really bugs people say free context. inaccurate. Another downside people still southeast Texas. get medication-induced panic attacks sometimes, feel like can't breathe, manually breathe, start hyperventilating, etc. Luckily, happened recently, I'm going struggle masks does. I'll either deal go out, though... disappointing :(. problem one wants alarmist especially lockdowns treated enormous overreaction idiots.

We know looks like lockdown again.

I think did, might way inclined so. Unfortunately, like governor, get reap majority sowed. thought David Blaine didn’t read title. villains played Tom Hanks: road perdition (gangster), Ladykillers (evil scheming professors), CEO “The Circle”... overwhelming hospitals? Someone r/CoronavirusWa saying Covid spread children, totally fine playdates kids parties. 
That dice I'm willing roll. Nope protect vulnerable never said one time don’t matter Well yes no. europe police kill randomly skin tone.
But people racist to. One aspect vaccines include adjuvants, additives help induce stronger immune response. Aluminum commonly used effective. obviously many components obviously that's one directly affects overall antibody production. good way see people taking seriously likely staying home much isolating, morons get make public appearances Yes latter position described common wisdom area lol. ""We gotta work hard immunity""; dont people expect really lol evidence stats? pandemic, emergency-use approval given data first two trial phases compelling enough, said expert condition anonymity. would allow launch without third phase conducted, approval would likely given riders submit additional data adverse event reports. running public health agency PR money spare, I'd paying celebrities Instagram ""influencers"" share pictures wearing masks. love arguing website since late Feb early March based published research also available since getting downvoted saying much. Citizens found without mask following COVID-19 prevention guidelines public places Gwalior work volunteers hospitals police check-posts three days, official said Monday.

I love it. Every country this. Especially US. many Latinos taking seriously... tell I'm one many around care ... definitely changing Millennial generation older generations fairly accurate observation. Ever walked around city smelled cigarette saw anyone smoking? Well, that's aerosols. virus spreads aerosols.

If you, time, breathe aerosols infected person breathed out, also get infected.

You basically can't escape aerosols closed rooms (unless talking really huge rooms). could see mental exhaustion employees face. clear ""are f***** kidding lady..?"" 41 days since protests started. Get Q bullshit here. goes political narrative... Idiots like situation. seeing Airlines businesses regulatory capture USA want people talking knowing else it'll affect businesses.

Same reason we're acknowledging Corona airborne. without global pandemic context, sounds like best summer camp style thing ever. limited experience now, situations like often lifelong memories / friendships formed.

not good comparison uni part student group would organize various events students also 2 times year team building exercises, 1 freshmen one completely internal. years lot fun 2 went completely shit looking back also ones really build teamspirit.

on freshman trip 2 idiot freshman hat much drink randomly bit nose one guy group. hold huge freshman wait 45min police others drive nose guy hospital.

the internal one stuck, camping smal house middle nowhere. 1sr night rainstorm + extreme cold, to. quickly bring firewood cellar still dry light fire fireplace, helping others, getting more. wood last thi night dry it, save electronics, etc. good news sounds exactly like happened here. People got tired lockdowns following guidelines; wanted things back normal. 

I hope works better you. I'm wondered read definitive answer.  vaccines, ""done"", siting there, thing that's standing way deployment necessary testing? something tweaked way?

Because ya, interesting think vaccine expect ready go point ""done"" back March even earlier? read lot, one would hope would grow learn it, though think capable it. Basic rules adults keep 1.5 meter distance eachother pref kids aswell, hands more, work home can. 

Kindergarden 0-4 kids teachers dont need distance themselfs. Parents form line outside bringing picking kids. 

4-12 social distance kids, try keep distance teachers (but really work)

13-18 know least about. believe started later schools keep distance changed 1st july. 1.5 meter distance.

The netherlands opened exept use 1.5meter society. 
We whole diffrent safety net usa. sick stay home. cost days stuff like that. 
Thisway think also makes sure people cough stay home. 
I got covid sick 4 weeks thats bad boss is. 
In usa even healthcare plan needs job think lot people rather work sick change losing those. Exactly. studies, thought, shown arisolization.

I’m type one diabetic A1Cs hover little 7.0. Also 21. 

I think I’m better every 75 year old there. So, way see happening next six months 50 states + get together outside DC, form new coalition-government body, start handling things. bad coronavirus going point on? first remember hearing coronavirus early january year first horrible feeling surprised rapidly became global pandemic even though people around told negative.

Over course lockdown adjusted feel bit better, hopeful. expected pandemic last least sping/summer 2021 made peace that. recently information emerging virus getting bad feeling again. news even badly hit country like Spain antibody testing revealed small percentage population exposed. news mild infections still struggling recover months illness even strokes heart attacks, previously young healthy people doctors know treat help them. 

In country easing lockdown worries me. think likely second wave winter worry go much longer initally thought perhaps several years.

Am gloomy paranoid realistic? quarter population infected, there's going back now, no? runaway geometric progression.. Get crazy Q bullshit here. Lol who’s gonna pay people unemployed? “pretty simple” justify losing job able put food table, 20 yr small business shut good don’t cash flow make virus existential threat humanity?

Why want numbers though? Albegeria made country. Death cult long absolutely will.

I going fucking pissed get sick fuckwads. I'm going pissed someone love gets sick dies fuckwads.

For example, go today DMV (because sister murdered February *had* deal car finally). employees wearing masks, though required customers wear one enter building. rule wearing continually correctly though. doctors office last week claimed required masks half employees patients wearing one. people stores companies wearing masks. fucking awful. Canadian equivalent)

I trust DeSantis though 🤣 Deaths would increase nearly 600% get back highs. Cases, much they’ve exploded, haven’t increased nearly much like said treatment getting better patients getting younger. think deaths see bump don’t see NY levels reached Probably long long get decent president.  Good luck, brother hab opossite thing. train station. 2 people (including wear mask).

I even go jogging mask... ffs Go fish. Funny say this. Vaccines normally take several years develop. know side effects vaccine released late 2020 - early 2021 would development accelerated? Really? Mine awesome. Changed life. wept one passed away. prison operators responsibility health prisoners US law? ""YOU'RE CALLING US FLORDIAN'S STUPID?""

#""WE'LL SHOW STUPID!"" one said risk drops 0.


Wearing mask everyone else's safety. Everyone else wearing mask safety.


Follow guidelines.


Nothing perfectly safe. people can't cast absentee ballots, vote mail, one allowed enter polling station without mask on, forced leave take off. Adrenochome hellova drug. soulless fucks.... things inherently imply intent. I'm inferring anything, explicitly saying it. Better treatment longer lag.

If hospital max deaths spike. incredibly offensive dismissive assume everybody one day decide stop making depressed anxious. One glance major mental health subreddits make clear that, counterintuitively, people depression anxiety disorders tend wallow pain opposed stopping source pain many people simply can’t stop easily. comment ignorant analogy COVID nonsensical. Yeah hope batch turns 100% negative move next batch. batch shows positive go back test every individual sample. accomplished anything, fact wasted time batch.

In words... saves time/money batches run negative. 
 Yeah, labeled ""Pneumonia"" ""caused directly virus""

 Umm.. ok. could stay home forever. bummer miss extended family. nah nobody’s signing anything new.

it’s definitely slipped T&amp;C’s current entry pass holders.  Oh, sad. Dont tell wall street actually friends work film tv follow news it, nice assumption. Ooh sounds nutty. guess what’s coming, hopefully effective methods treatment developed. Life get back normal, wearing masks probably new normal highly doubt. Social distancing killing lot industries won’t last long, probably maximum another 3-4 month social distancing countries states countries butchered covid response. Again, saying calm down? - im calm. C'mon - pretending Trumps MO? buy drug known work minimize symptoms? funny part think actually gives shit Americans - lining pockets nothing more. sad Melania Ivanka? Thank goodness masterful decision UK incompetence international student, thankfully US, think policy absolute dogshit. Omnishambles. Lmfao We've shithole country while, apparent now. OMG. Ha ha ha. go back March EVERYBODY pushing herd immunity. Everybody. use word entered public vocabulary yet.

Even CA describing herd immunity. Newsom saying lockdown allow catch time 60% California going get infected. 

Amazingly pretty much everybody board. Nobody Sub calling Newsom callous murderer.

Then suddenly like 2 weeks later changed ""stay inside vaccine"". Wow, schools already thought Petri dish... going problematic, school become ""De Facto"" babysitting service.

Trudeau.  know wrote. never claimed thing. expressed personal prediction situation would like 'normal' circumstances. might right, might wrong, that's predictions work.
You may think preposterous prediction, case refer irrationalism unpredictability human mind. anyone know link specifically states caused happen? I've seen ""due coronavirus complications"". know 5-10 people virus nothing remotely close happened.. Obviously everyone different, something else happen caused get leg amputated that!? wear mask 4th... home sitting roof watching neighborhood erupt, felt like storming Normandy many explosions going off. That’s irrelevant. know never take responsibility mistake bad thing. always blame enemies amount hero savior. question really is: won’t say? I'm forced, I'm making decision based fact wear one indoors public places, outside unless I'm crammed people. ROFL!!!! joke, right? right?

After infect more, please send back. also employment system misuses educational system. pay play. need master's degree ""move up"" library even though could get information by...um...reading books topic, maybe? ones supposedly provided staff development never consider actual development?

and even working Oxford vaccine doubts timeline, news lately, Bell, Regius Professor Medicine Oxford University, said Britain prepare COVID-19 vaccine winter encourage people get flu vaccinations avoid “pandemonium” hospitals.  Again, that's inference. imply anything. flatly stated purpose pandemic, maybe would better word use since everyone stuck one f****** word, return balance nature. give virus heart soul, anthropomorphize instill upon intelligence.

Would happier ""The purpose human pandemic scrape humans Earth""? There. fixed. It’s hospitals get creative capacity. hospital might’ve nearing capacity yesterday, today room cancelling elective surgeries turning wing Covid floor. ballistic vests masks? oh think vaccine announced Fall, think properly vetted even work.

Thank god minority governments. Gland texted studies shown protesting, outdoor activity, lead increased rate exposure. One study, published last month five economists National Bureau Economic Research, said link protests increase COVID-19 cases. Gland said march, hands masks hand sanitizer, continue encourage safe practices.

Honestly, got accomplished set things fire.

And police stopped rioting, protesters protesting.

I hope Gland complete full recovery. got arts crafts Karen *cries Georgia* moved testing Brazil South Africa get data. protesters got message out. message needs remain. time get smarter Covid, like political rallies, beach parties anti mask social distance people. Need stop spread Covid. That’s cause he’s kinda French pretends know French. soooo ... hows going. aleady know impacts placenta bith weight.

If insurance try looking online insurance website, like mycigna myblucross whatever. That's found options, practices network. checked one Google reviews, chose highly reviewed one. looked reviews doctors. go thisl restaurants plumbers... mental health mattered much more. already best words. issue reason, people US absolutely HATE told do- even it’s health. purposely cut nose spite face, say “I’ll *I* want! can’t make *me* anything! 😝” make good point one many forget, endowments many restrictions funds. restrictions reason many people gave endowments. People want money spent operating costs could encourage excess spending school.  course current situation likely considered restrictions put place... would’ve kicked second heard. Honestly, dare idea change meeting discourse, give sex doll. wearing mask “virtue signaling” propaganda tactic

Time place. virtue signaling. wearing neck tie, MAGA hat, BLM T-shirt. is. Trumps germaphobe, ever get close people rallies, stands waves them. probably turned oval office clean room let anyone in. much wish true, going nihilist view going say support still strong, hill-billy toothless cult followers reason people getting sick follow leaders ideology wearings masks ""far left liberal antifa"" whatever bull shit spews.



I know people saying ""he screwed big time way handled pandemic"" said every thing he's done far he's still kicking go hard campaign second term supporters side.

Supreme Court ruled todat electoral college members need follow states laws involving voting electoral college. state says electoral college members MUST vote winner popular vote state/district, longer vote whoever want.

Even old people get sick survive minority get complications it. know nonzero risk every person, come guys, easy understand people willing take risk.

I've seen people compare polio say ""well polio asymptomatic people paralyzed some"".. yes that's true, someone lung scarring know got X-ray comparable living iron lung percentage people severe complications covid much smaller polio. Again, nonzero risk, explains people willing chance it.

Everyone saying ""it's flu"" naming possible complications including death also delusional. flu yes deadly. However... y'all know flu cause organ failure, amputations, blood clots, pneumonia death too, right? Like, tens thousands people die every year. harmless. I'm glad decided masks important keep people safe. hope carry energy future flu seasons too, though. think nailed flumenco.

*Makes jerk motion hand*  Read article. open campus mean classes online. colleges transparent courses campus, exclusions various research engineering (hands-on) courses, though campus ""open"".

When first started, felt like someone rubbed Vicks VapoRub face tried clean off. 

Over course couple weeks faded feeling like ants crawling face. 

I legit thought reaction medication something odd striking sensation, came lots COVID19 patients similar experiences. 

Nowadays kinda... there. seems fade out, may tuning -- like tinnitus. 

A constant feeling like holding face freshly poured Coca-Cola. TRAP!!! assumptions

Wait literally claiming WW2 veteran right now?  Yeah, damn frustrating. everyone took responsibility responsible covid would incredibly easy beat, like many countries done far. People selfish prideful wear simple mask stay fuck home months. Maybe international students, public universities reported [full(or near full) enrollment Fall . 

What H.S. grads going do? Gap year? can't really travel. can't really get job environment.

 Save money community college? Enrollment community colleges limited plus already students were/are already dedicated route. 

So basically stay home nothing enroll college/university delay freshman experience pandemic run course. Heh take loan .. wouldn’t investing them.. wear I. That's people want, it? else want me? First blood car? better say, happy eager muzzled? Sorry dude, gonna happen. coming US screwed countries lack leadership? Exactly point. still Europe gotten situation control.

I think that's made stereotype, Germans really known less sensible others. love traveling though. Even north Sweden they're quite common summer. Germans Norwegians love vacationing Sweden Darwin Award nominees Let virus run course. wont stop everyone getting it. better working class losing jobs, apsrtments/houses homeless street. run course like NY.

soooo Excess deaths poor proxy deaths Covid-19 though. irony. Yeah aren’t antibody half lives three weeks so? ago... No, absolutely saying. 

I personally believe regardless title, wealth, background treated like human held accountable actions.

What saying rules sub protect political figures calls threats violence users due high prevalence threats/utterances reddit.

Not belief system all, even agree sub rule, are. openly asking SOMEONE still violates rules. 

I hope mods explain you. hard you? issue numbers say, Florida morning yesterday, less people working log data. tomorrow's data Florida representing backlog employees enter today's data well.

edit, answer earlier question, could answered quick google search, Connecticut, Rhode Island Kentucky report new cases deaths July 5th. Yeah something similar. quit smoking cigs (still smoke weed) cut back drinking. GF makes walk 2 hours day. gained 3 hours life back commuting. afford time energy take care again. I’ve lost almost 50lbs. need to

I witnessed pushing Buzz Lightyear window earth would live life pandemic. anxiety added mix? That’s power move. wish would. wish compassion could taught easily. unfortunately care. care.

One, PM trying model behavior Canadians: wear masks, social distance, meetings teleconferencing working home, travelling. Two, USA lot distress right covid charts. People close president gotten sick. believe safe foreign leaders White House. Especially President social distance wear mask. 

Plus optics! world hurting, physically, mentally psychologically. really time throw new NAFTA celebration? Read room. CDC perhaps? imagine. see us entering deaths saw couple months like 1-3 thousand daily 2-3 weeks now? good point good example bad tweak temporarily staves catastrophe, ultimately makes worse.

Canada, still call NAFTA it’s basically NAFTA Masks usually wire stiffener top. Bend around nose wear stiffener way near top nose, near eyes. helps fogging. Also article apparently says exhale mouth (don't know yet). Exhaling fogging comes from. conversion really easy.

Just remember 1 ft almost exactly 30cm, makes 1 yard 1 meter almost equal (in reality like 1.1 yards per meter).

You remember miles kilometers Fibonacci sequence. Every two subsequent Fibonacci numbers correspond miles kilometers.

1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,88...

For example, 8 miles 13 km 55 miles 88 km.

Easy! point matter came from. United States held responsible Spanish flu China help responsible Covid-19 (if that's came from). focused wrong things... That's entire point. government wants focused things matter like virus came stop it. knowing came first going solve point?... Honestly, absolutely nothing. care? 

I say fact United States trying blame China Covid-19 one blamed United States Spanish flu pretty relevant. think issue 1918? Nope. worried millions dead people. really shows priorities United States government right now. take virus seriously, controlled mitigated. Belgian 9 cyclists die heart failure last 5 years. Something isn’t right. Yeah - people online care *citation* like play gotcha lazy look themselves. plenty articles reddit detail Texas counting beds late. plenty articles hospitals divert patients well long ambulance waiting times. yeah, feel free rant ""don't know,"" w/o ever work yourself. ...Of enough money American healthcare! short answer is, don’t know. 

I attended school, graduated 2007. taught public school year. budget science experiments, multiple violent students, weekly drug issues. Moved charter school 2 years. Left earn masters. Taught different public school year. school intolerable me. poor kids desperately need help, I’m equipped handle it. Moved back charter school last 3 years. 

During time I’ve couple severe medical issues, would miss work months time. school kept job paid full pay time, despite pay long-term substitute. 

They treated well. I’m good teacher want keep me. again, there’s job security union. I’m really torn. need system show we've vaccinated, ostracize deplorables. always remember: scientific evidence available suggests parachutes prevent injuries death jumping 25,000 feet jump experience: Scientific Evidence: ... parachutes evidence-based way leaving plane without injuries, refrain adding additional drop weight using one :) lost year anyway every tourism country, focus much Sweden tourism even big thing countries?!

Edit: argumentation talking now. isn’t funny. It’s heartbreakingly sad. health care system crap solutions dealing mentally ill people kick house call cops (as husband did) arrested. Even know someone needs help, can’t get help. asshole Toy Story admit rail blockades little disappointing, taking sides here. know enough details. dragged on........I think everyone agrees matter right wrong, decision could come lot sooner. didnt say going punch mouth. said deserves/needs one mouth. dont care they're politicians still human people need speak up. “No worse cold” - That’s assuming sub clinical lung damage doesn’t long term effects. Tests results also lagging way behind effective time period tracing contsinment. Tell good luck that...

NYC hospitals overrun, even though much higher number cases deaths, neither Texas. 

Articles like serve nothing get clicks alarm people. gives deniers ammo “cried wolf” argument.


But like said, people still need safe cautious can. much would love believe that, can’t. absolutely inundated evidence dreadful illness is. people aren’t convinced already, won’t change it. 1. corona-viruses vaccine 6 human corona-viruses, SARS1 MERS never became threatening long enough vaccine efforts bear fruits, 4 seasonal colds serious enough justify effort. corona-viruses vaccines animals subject standards humans.
2. get common colds lots different common cold viruses, corona-viruses, rhinoviruses, get one immune others. far, researches show current candidates going effective while, even not, give regular boosters keep vaccine effective. 

Basically impossible vaccine efforts go badly, looks unlikely right now. ""10 days"" means they're already screwed, considering incubation period partying went points generation never lived without terrorism, since Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

Its like 80% related common cold fuck 20% affects everyone completely differently? liked fuck buddy Keeping distance eachother, hand sanitizer. We're also testing lot people, since everyone go book test online masks much uncomfortable especially use long periods time like multiple hours shift breaks etc. think hard get idiots wear t-shirt rubber bands 20minute outing wait till try pushing masks them.

Wear masks, kids. Getting coronavirus thing dying. It’s measuring risk reward. less people, wearing masks distancing, risk getting coronavirus smaller. However, gym, lot people wearing masks social distancing. genuine question? really can’t tell Poe’s Law. don’t mean offensive. Given symptoms listed, I'm surprised doctor suspect Covid. tested you? virus airborne? No. lots. data suggests 1.4% infected die.

There 331 million people US.

If everyone got infected (unlikely), 4.6 million could die, based current clinical data.

So reach 1.7 million, need 33% get infected.

Meanwhile, assholes like refuse wear mask.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes. Businesses spread propaganda want reopen, they're losing money. Russians Chinese spreading propaganda want British Americans dead.

Both working simultaneously ruin lives. point lockdown slow spread virus reducing potential contacts. every contact 1% chance, cut contacts half, virus spreads half fast. 

During extended lockdown, China lot that:

* educated population COVID-19 transmission containment
* transferred 42,000 healthcare workers Wuhan provide care
* built 2 dedicated ICU hospitals within 10 days
* built dozen field hospitals 
* spun PPE manufacturing 12x 
* spun testing capabilities
* massive case management test, identify isolate infected people
* developed deployed 'big data' automated tracing tools
* developed 'contactless' systems
* sanitized streets buildings

China went realized serious things were. 

India using lockdown time similarly, that's takes stop disease. live rural Northern California people hanging maskless petitions recall first lockdown “hoax”🤷‍♂️ No, not. much ancestors spelling 'van Briesbroeck' wrongly ;-) county? Italy. total amount varies different jobs seniority, least 180 days every year. really problem contagious diseases. know reason could come vaccine fast working similar one? fuck wrong people trying reduce scientific studies' budgets wasting shit tons squared bueracracy, politics wars?! Go cry something else. I'd imagine since antibodies carried blood stream. 

source: Every 20 seconds someone Florida tests positive 

Goddamn 

And lately Florida reporting daily cases entirety Europe, IIRC Yep Pros cons it. 

Pros:
Work amazing I’m lucky enough able work completely remotely

I’m creative time make new things.

More time home cooked meals.

Cons:
Less exercise daily outings. 1 walk day doesn’t feel good active day.

Personal interactions gone WAY feel less connected online contact. Thank god husband I’d die loneliness.

No travel :( I’ve 5km away house since March. That’s really valid point. It’s fair accurate say ‘Indians’. $600 ends end month. economical impact study Generation X? misses point face masks, mass adoption protect wearer, protect others wearer.

We need wear masks prevent asymptotic spread, stop catching ourselves.

So selfish morons eliminated gene pool. disease take young plenty chance breed. original point people need money they’ll start radical things, country many guns US shit could get really bad. 

Someone responded implying gun owners group think virus isn’t real whatever. thought oversimplification changed topic. TRUE. 

Negative posts upvoted super high even outlier case across country.

But Fauci said he's optimistic vaccine within 6 months? 200 upvotes bunch apathetic comments. 

This sub fear mongering. new virus found called g4 ""say"" immunity humans h1n1 gonna work. Hopefully case world gives bit care things panic late. Again, saying ""the world ending gonna die"" saying keep eye stuff stay informed prepared. Mass Hysteria bad Mass Ignorance pandemic saw graph might use look one UK see correlation year previous years.

We’ve pandemic 5 months. Democracy doomed fail depend decision making masses, masses dumb. burn fast. typical flu vaccine effectiveness around 50%. Wearing mask law, Americn cops follow law. PEI amazing job resources. Anti-maskers new anti-vaxxers. Irrational, irresponsible, prone bizarre beliefs. Unfortunately seem even aggressive. probably right, I'll still day 1 take it.

Claim cannot accurate unless mask ues 100%. verdict still out. American though. personal stake this.

I talk Europeans Canadians daily basis Americans, feel misconceptions created media really happening due fact politicized country. hides real cause problem believe lack universal health care paid sick leave. think charge happy see us blaming squabbling amongst politics, masks, whether beaches open status quo remains, people forced make decisions whether keep roof heads, feed families, retain access health care, cautious going work sick.

And shutdown put tens millions health care plans. lost job. think someone health care, job, family support keen paying get tested treated uncertain economy even open work again? people love disparage “stupid Americans”. 70 countries, lived 5 4 continents. American people stupid anywhere else. aren’t even biggest fans “freedumb” people putting here. bet woman actually learn anything. lost daughter she'll probably still continue believe idiotic things currently believes find way blame everyone people lied her. compulsive liar. explosive display I'd guess pretty deeply rooted conflict avoidance.

One excuse may give don’t wanna cause panic else could best time panic epidemics natural disasters. don’t buy conspiracy theories antivaxxers ....just two fellas stupid incompetent. death rates lower like diseases, kids stronger immune systems less time develop long term health condition (blood pressure pressure, lower cancer rates, etc). it?

No didn't. right issues, claim completely wrong. Given ICE exemption spring semester, guess agency, like administration, implicit/explicit orders move pandemic start treating COVID-19 non-issue. So, look lens, sort say stupid decision.

* Dominic Cummings used Neil Ferguson's exaggerated figures get Boris U-Turn UK strategy. broke quarantine go 260 mile drive.
* Catherine Calderwood leading voice Scotland, urging public obey restrictions. broke quarantine visit holiday home. Twice.
* Days chairing government news conference Westminster reinforce ""stay home"" message, Robert Jenrick appeared Sky News via video link seventeenth century manor house owns hamlet Eye. despite Nottinghamshire MP's website stating family live 120 miles away constituency Newark, well London.

You don’t invite married girlfriend round house, send back husband children, really believe there’s dangerous virus.

You don’t drive Durham middle “national emergency” really believe could get infected die.

You don’t break self-isolation early barbecue neighbours truly think terrible disease could make family sick.

If tell shouldn’t eat chocolate, make head explode, take chocolate eat – wouldn’t think *“You hypocrite! fool! could make head explode!”*, would you?

You’d far likely think *“Hey, lied could steal chocolate.”*

When people giving us orders follow themselves, showing “hypocrites”. showing *liars*. admitting don’t really believe they’re saying. Boogaloo 
 
I strongly encourage everyone stop using word, downvote see Nazis stolen it. stolen it, did. Acting like helps them. stand corrected. saw data back May much lower that. 

So 3778 deaths Florida, 1889 nursing homes. stupid. School open matter what. School important online classes joke. saw comment. That’s think well. It’s even likely freshman haven’t made personal connections. Seniors job prospects might push through. Voldemort’s back!?!! Article follows:

A Florida medical examiner's report raised questions 17-year-old Fort Myers resident's death COVID-19 complications last month. teenager, Carsyn Davis, cancer survivor rare, ongoing autoimmune disorder. died respiratory failure contracting new coronavirus early June.

The medical examiner's report notes Davis attended 100-person church event, people required wear face masks, roughly two weeks died Miami-Dade County hospital. nine days followed, given antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine oxygen via grandfather's portable machine parents home. mother, Carole Brunton Davis, nurse. hospital recommended intubation Davis admitted pediatric unit June 19, parents declined procedure, according county medical examiner. received plasma therapy eventually intubated June 22, died one day later.

Hydroxychloroquine, anti-malaria drug President Donald Trump praised COVID-19 treatment method throughout much pandemic, later flagged U.S. Food Drug Administration possibly detrimental patients' health. FDA explained could potentially cause ""serious potentially life-threatening heart rhythm problems"" statement released April 24.

Local news outlets published reports Davis' death end June, citing comments mother wrote now-deleted Facebook post. Sunday, data scientist Rebekah Jones called attention medical examiner's findings report, published part project called Florida COVID Victims. project one element larger initiative, Florida COVID Action, independently reports state's coronavirus statistics.

Jones formerly oversaw Florida Department Health's COVID-19 dashboard removed position May, Florida began reopen. email went viral soon after, Jones suggested reason longer managed health department's virus data rooted commitment ""accessibility transparency."" continues publish Florida's virus data Florida COVID Action. project's mission statement says aims ""in proper context"" ""without political agenda.""

On Monday, Jones told Newsweek found medical examiner's report Davis' death conducting research Florida COVID Victims.

""I validating deaths data Medical Examiner's reports, Department Health's case-line data, Florida Department Law Enforcement's reports part larger project find deaths removed DOH's case data found report Carsyn Davis,"" Jones said, adding initially noticed report pediatric case.

""I started looking mother, church COVID party held 100 children, health history, felt angry sad happened,"" continued.

Davis member congregation Fort Myers' First Assembly God. church reportedly hosted ""party"" June 10. Facebook post reportedly advertised event deleted church's social media page Monday. help showing early on. everyone look Virginia Maine. states right. They're definitely it. Although start requiring masks may stop. Nope. tried that. proven wrong used platform fake news. ""See, said 220,000 people going die. think going 70k. economy come roaring back know it."" suckers ate started spitting poison health professionals causing panic. want perfectly clear he’s delusional thinking things okay “stable,” based *some* truth. 

At height New York’s outbreak, testing around 50% positive counties, testing restricted due shortages PPE testing reagents. know this. scientific community thinks 1/20-30 cases identified. point, testing much available much better idea cases Florida. way we’re catching 1/20-30. 

That said, currently two-week waiting period test county turnaround time 7-10 days. testing numbers seeing reflect infections occurred month ago. could disastrous, could good. ED visits county dropped first time (it goes weekly basis), two weeks county mask ordinance three weeks Tampa mask ordinance. Hopefully masks slow spread significantly chances DeSatan instituting another safe home order slim none. 

The narrative “young people” also unfair. Yes, we’re seeing increase cases people 45. That’s lie. perfectly clear, beginning outbreak needed 65 older qualify test unless traveled country required hospitalization. Additionally, people 45 likely back work now. surprising 45 likely infected now. 

While conclusions wrong, reasons pretty true. Tampa Bay Times, along local papers, done great job throughout this. excellent charts options different counties. They’ve also made coronavirus coverage free (without login). strongly recommend coverage what’s happening Florida. Don’t worry don’t metric system US good! 

Most American don’t know 10 meters 32 feet plus understand....what reasoning?

 usualy exclusively far left comes immigrants really see hell supposed help....??

international exchange education one nobler things humans do...education human right.

I mean ok get want let new ones in...fair enough....we pandemic....but ones already there.... That's stupid know reviving dead thread;however, major conflict interest oversee election office. find hard take seriously tbh forced us. bet charge amount, too. scam. sorry, people body type allowed take selfies without running past first? Foreign students pay university locals, way universities would board this. lockdown, everything else. mass manufacturing PPE (up 12x first couple months), app big data tracing, move isolation quarantines, contactless processes, education, more. things addition strict lockdown gave good result. 

Imagine US decided open wallet really absolutely everything possible eliminate disease. would lock hard, demand masks, ramp PPE production, train people, coordinate levels, forth. would cost lot, America would done couple months.

As numbers, yes, there's undercount beginning - every country problems data early on. post lockdown? Probably 100% accurate. robust mature testing tracing system massive capacity. numbers good, lie, even wanted to. China 5 cases go nuts. America 50,000 cases keeps reopening. Truthful reporting benefits China far lie possibly could. India 3rd highest cases, get report that. no, report 1 2 domestic cases, many imported cases, global explosion led America India. would fine, long edge mask fitted face, matter whether center touching face not. want force air go filtration material, escape sides, avoid gaps edge mask face. tent would problem long edge seal intact. girlfriend works large hospital downtown Austin. almost full ICU capacity turning hospitals trying transfer patients cities. really getting serious people need wake up. He'll pale, shaky, podium 6 months retracting criticisms. Ministry State Security good bruises burns visible suit. think confusion comes fact new vaccines wouldn’t ready next year testing go through.

But one existing vaccine (for MERS) gone safety checks, need check works effectively enough use Covid-19 prime example what's wrong people America.

Ultimately us safer LEOs wear PPE. Hopefully aware risks wear PPE like wear bullet proof vests. Good. Murder charge. calling stupid comment mean I’m upset? Assume assume assume read article copy-pasted pertinent paragraphs give idea health officials, including Anthony Fauci considering:

## ""Test groups, individuals

The basic idea [pooled allows public health officials test small groups – called pools – people using one test. means test people faster, using fewer tests less money.

Instead testing one person time, samples multiple individuals would mixed together tested one. test comes back negative, everyone pool clear. positive, member pool tested individually.

For example, imagine workplace 20 people, one infected. Pooled testing divides 20 people four groups five. Samples taken person mixed samples people group. grouped sample tested – four tests all.

One pools turn positive contains single infected person. five people pool retested individually, one sick person identified.

In all, nine tests used 20 workers screened. everyone screened individually, would taken 20 tests."" Born Europe, lived 3 different continents 9 different cities since birth. ok.

Doc told get blood test... week later coronavirus happened. putting months Thanks, hope too. really do. going take massive community effort looking get thing, one step time. don’t understand could positive research see you’re against, least verify belief asymptomatic contagious. 

On related note, government actively avoided real information education campaign regarding covid responsibly containing nauseating Masks. That's literally it.

Testing matter. Like article says, Japan hardly testing. Testing cure anybody stop spread. test want people wear masks staring big number going up.

If everybody puts mask virus virtually gone month. Tampa ICUs already full one poked hole. fact looked stupider stupider every response. wonder media fooled like clown show.

Bottom line virus doesn’t warrant lockdowns restrictions. strong hypocrisy make immediately question narrative. meant similar specifically regards local governments report larger government. person responding arguing perhaps unintentionally favor essence authoritarian government, one group/person control. tempting suggest kimd government responds best something like pandemic, democratic republics managed well. Sure, maybe ""world"" inside tiny pea-sized skull come conclusion. However, us actual ""world"" not, quite contrary. Lol @ body weight exercises. We're ok. ok people following basic protocol. People wearing masks like were. good amount wear properly. went store today reason people need make family event. know people going parties, traveling. awful. India 1 mid August Skeptical face.

Yes, certain high risk businesses (i.e. bars, indoor dining), businesses could opened safely... handled right. means primed immune system react strongly wrong way (type 2 immune response) encountered virus real. Viruses usually trigger type 1 response. type 2 response usually parasites, though also gets triggered allergies/asthma. way body fights parasites causes great deal inflammation collateral damage healthy tissue. Inflammation lungs causes pneumonia, bad enough, ARDS. pandemic people say “only” 20k deaths. enormous tragedy given India’s population size, gradually increasing numbers cases, vulnerable healthcare system expect get lot worse coming months. Zhong Nanshan normal spokesperson, went CCP narrative twice already publicly occasions made China look bad embarrassment government, yet proven right times. He's fame China makes beyond political reproach outspoken Li Wenliang's first foremost doctor scientist definitely party man. Lmao probably wants catch “vibe” light show  sure. cannot wait get pre-pandemic stressors flying. hope get safe plane soon!   feel you. hope goes well you. town taken seriously.

Same reason going movie theater that’s fire.

What’s like idiot? Cause he’s asshole probably thinks “no one tell wear mask!” UNC Chapel Hill simply worst. also, every time someone pokes hole idiocy, move another ridiculous line reasoning.

your argumentation worse actual arugment lol well too... I'd rather die see Pfizer make dime this.  Well heard campaign encouraging masks next rally. chose New Hampshire, state numbers going down. People showing risk lives. would guessed. can't lot people matter understand new cases take month turn fatalities? hope everyone plane wears mask keep safe Camp Crystal Lake, Tx hospital ICU beds, put one. Somebody else booted. Outbreak way far start contact tracing. taught say gay Hilary Duff president! Currently Coronavirus Florida despite wearing mask constantly months - I'm glad quit, noooooot worth amount money. leads purchase? think Trump wants cut every tie World Health Organization? Bingo. Oh okay, see you’re saying. You’re right could easily massive amount infections early March gatherings large basketball games still on. problem though many antibody surveys around world conducted within three months outbreak results aren’t necessarily outdated. I’m sure antibodies reliably become undetectable 3 months either highest antibody positivity found, 57% residents, Bergamo, Italy, survey conducted April 23rd June 3. outbreak peaked February sewage samples suggested virus present area since way back December.

I really wish could say 99% infections harmless like Trump said massive reservoir immunity early March, unfortunately data doesn’t seem support that. hate say this, say expect already mass immunity, less seriously people take virus problems controlling it. crazy believing it, given source.  Wow. due fact Canada prepared learned 2003 Sars. Good job piece shit. hope don’t see emergency department get sick.  I'm live WA around Yakima. Jist keeping track numbers.

Scroll mask use country territory see heard sick elderly affected, anything keeps going fun. beautiful day, 4th weekend, let's go play!


Obesity also thing people. find posts/vlogs? Would like look past. 1 ship = 100,000 cars worth CO2 didn’t appear healthy Covid.  Even *I* knew January. Anyone done reading epidemiology read headlines new novel virus China. gross incompetence corruption exposed US shocked core. *course* (Fed Gov/CDC) taken immediate measures *January*. complicit deaths. them. 7 million get vaccine then? We’ve accepted society long ago. It’s new bridge cross, sold data convenience. Friends Mountain View Switzerland. Mmm? Right, 150 million people get (nearly half US population) translates 1.5 million deaths. ICU units get overflowed, death rate goes people cannot get lifesaving treatment covid19, also strokes, heart attacks, car accidents, etc etc.

If people lost shit 3000 death 9/11 4 deaths Benghazi, utterly hypocritical losing shit right now. I’m wondering actually part problem. would think grueling schedule like would put considerable stress immune system, matter well-conditioned body might be. Yes, keep closed threat passed. Lathe gatherings drunk people shouting close proximity good idea pandemic, it? sure? reading two days ago perhaps new information. one doctor multiple. know ""speculate"" testing positive months later again. Sounds awful death paneley. way much like Avenue 5. article two days old details results Saturday, Florida made news globally. Sunday around 10.5k I’m waiting today’s. seems peak Thursday Thursday. agree, admit lot irritation people try search information, least make effort.  Taking precautions one thing stating something fact another. Hope sending anything us Australia? happens occasionally people ECMO, surprised there's another COVID patient got put ECMO lost leg. Crippling body aches? Dezoned area omw problem bar? Another restaurant bar could opened done fine.

This type ineffective leadership common punishes good operators treats innocent people like criminals.

If one corrupt councilman corrupt I'm area forever? Good outcomes 99%+ infected people proves Covid19 bad. obstinate nature many americans feel entitled put other's safety welfare risk. hoping karma offer solutions  find taking antibody test. entertaining exactly high quality TV show.  Navy destroyer somehow misses calamitous world-ending event, struggles save what's left America world ""Trumpexit""? reading elsewhere, sounds like trials already underway. Here's hoping quick successful results.  attended bunch them. one went would say poorly masked, happened small, spontaneous march. rest large (thousands), literally could count one hand number people personally saw unmasked. Experts say 90% masking required reduced spread, I'd say BLM protests overall, generally, part, reached exceeded 90%. hurry whats taking long No. It’s complicated: they’re fucking stupid. It’s incredible think handful people brought virus states, sheer incompetence allowed spread like raging wildfire Absolutely hearbreaking. Rest peace. :( think someone intelligent would clue people genuine need, ask assistance entering store call ahead make easier everyone, likely return store reduce hassle. make use shopping services avoid danger.

Does anyone know disability interfere ability stand scream store employees continuously 15 minutes disability interferes breathing can’t wear mask? true. Wow, promising. Let’s hope best! Well done 👍 Instead keeping schools closed, might let open let virus spread unchecked while, close? Why?

The please people loudly want things normal again. overwhelmingly obvious spreading disease hope people OK closing schools. 

I mean keep schools closed online disease spread stopped bunch people would say unnecessary first place. besides keep kids home sending parents back work make sense would it? teacher pointed many people school free daycare desperately need. 

So smart safe thing would require money help families GOP taboo. political plan act like nothing, hope miracle bodies start piling containers step close schools take credit bold leader. 

Wish joking that. **Totalitarian**: *relating system government centralized dictatorial requires complete subservience state.*  


**Authoritarian**: *favoring enforcing strict obedience authority, especially government, expense personal freedom.*  


What described lot closer Totalitarian government Authoritarian government. However, necessarily wrong Chinese government doubt governs well; trouble govern well relation well individuals within nation, well government dictated government itself. Wow, that's scary think diabete induced pregnancy would increase Covid severity. seems like pretty common thing pregnancy. Kinda like morning sickness (not common know mean). 

Poor girl. answer, wanted say I'm sorry good luck. Wish could send free pass Australia. One states 108 new cases today + 2 deaths. totally isolated rest country, $11K fine, 6 months jail cross border. Army 500 cops enforcing. Feb. remember seeing limited airborne transmission Feb China's debriefs. cruise workers typically pay taxes, I'm fan people contributing society getting bailed things go way movies, sports legal pot thinks looking America’s hat. brother lives there. said everyone wearing mask, encouraging weeks ago definitely case.  sure said I'll downvote anyway. Except fact low death rates lot adequate access healthcare 20% require hospitalization. hospitals fill staff overwhelmed, everything spiral pretty quickly. Like say Italy Spain higher death rates age population, lot deaths came result many needing medical intervention time. That’s triage happening. US needs f*cking federal government. Anyone notice guys posted 3 times? Also Michigan much larger Florida? death per millions include size difference? 1918 population knew fact dumb understand virus listen doctors more. 

now guess people know lot thing realize dumb dirt. 

so whatever want. Right? already sense smell. I'd imagine gradually return, though. way, could replace 'Mexico' country large outbreak statement would remain true.

But think interesting get specific data regarding country. 25% mostly infected recover, mostly immune.

We get immunity common cold flu, sure get immunity COVID-19? Public safety, man. even think twice. Report behind. Models accurate enough purpose, fastest alternative phase 3 trial would challenge trial, deliberately infect volunteers (who vaccine placebo) virus. ethically questionable scientist said want run trial, even though volunteers. highly masked. politician balls say anything would cancel even march house vandalize it. Add neutering local police departments politicians scared death angering mob. daughter RN Covid Unit said even positive test back, starting suspected Covid patients blood thinners help minimize clots. smallish county hospital Midwest. Adjuvants? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  herd immunity better

That's [herd works. Either cover sufficient percentage population kicks - get all. can't ""more"" herd immunity - check link.

Humans yet develop herd immunity famous viruses - common cold, flu, herpes, coronaviruses - really unclear get COVID-19. people still going hate regardless backbone don’t know college students would gap year since many places hiring. us get it, us want outraged direct wrong person.

Sure, laws used give government absolutely unlimited power demand anything, seize anything, long say magic words, ""it's emergency.""

That's authoritarian. That's point. originally said, ""Honestly, fucking privilege think authoritarian government looks like...""

I'm saying same. I'm saying intentions bad. I'm saying wrong pretend authoritarian.

You like authoritarian government force people things think important. Normal coming back... wondered too. Damn breaking records everyday. Half country decided follow mind instead leadership refuses listen science. sounds positive. Funny thing is, consider people follow direction medical doctors scientists viral pandemic sheep. think they're not-moronic. opposing argument know research wearing masks day in, day tiny percent us may virus, may symptoms somehow pass on.

Remember breathing carbon dioxide take breathers. I'm favour wearing areas social distancing hard making people feel safer majority people wear soon leave house till get home.

For record tonne 3M masks sell see people thinking golden ticket weight everything right. China cold normal wear mask. friend COVID-19 better it’s long road.

Ministry Health figures

The data John Hopkins University slightly different released Ministry Health. According ministry's latest survey, released Saturday, Brazil 1,577,004 confirmed cases , 876,359 recovered 64,265 deaths.  I’m pretty overweight I’m gonna try methods out. Glad hear ok sure country you’re posting US health disparities economic inequalities predisposition Hispanic Black minorities die hire rates virus. course virus doesn’t discriminate skin color.. specific races vulnerable virus health disparities biological weathering repeated bias.

You’re right it’s completion. you’re almost taking “all lives matter” approach issue. 

Asian Americans primarily experience individual racism (a form racial discrimination stems personal bias).

Black Americans experience individual racism systemic racism (policies practices entrenched larger institutions result exclusion designated groups).

I’m assuming you’re somewhere Europe? scenario may different country. Canadian here, lived large US city several years student. point “keep yourself” culture spot-on getting missed analysis. Canadians whole naturally “socially distant” Americans. culture noticeably introverted US, things like chatting public strangers much uncommon. Well fact need carbohydrates glucose brains function, idea remove things like beans diet. go keto page see things like bacon, eggs, red meat animal products, generally high fat low antioxidants dietary fiber. article mentions need reduce saturated fat eat dietary fiber antioxidants (whole plant foods). amazing man. Thank much. Ive running daily wanted way add strength training home workouts. explain encouraged Oxford AstraZeneca Covid vaccine? platform much longer period study much larger trial sizes. would seem eliminate downsides you’ve listed. suspect got went back NYC close apartment. Remember, he’s hospital 95 days would end March. celebrated july 4th fireworks yesterday together Wanted update: Nick Cordero passed away earlier today. 41 years old survived wife, Amanda, son, Elvis. you’ve aware since March rest us have, taken time educate yourself, haven’t developed back plan ideology/thought process Disneyland may (at least temporarily) answer.... 

Then yeah, don’t really feel bad. There’s short term answers. many peers worked restaurant industry. go back? Nope. adjust. bet. Blood clot. Yes get blood clots leading amputations. Blood thinners weren’t option led internal bleeding.

In case though, poor man went much. Woah - hot comment alert! Fort Worth otherwise. Exactly. 72, high blood pressure, I'm probably dead catch it. So, go food week senior hour supermarkets (Usually less 10 ppl store, 95% masked properly) Even KN95 mask goggles, go aisle there's someone else it.

If need anything else, order online. study references least one patient amputation. 

Also, given created, obvious amptuation real risk. Cordero famous example. Well, bet would look lot like current White House's strategy, aka ""What Coronavirus?"" modern reddit homey, threads blow big quickly even matter. come hoping big quote article relevant info it. think massively underestimating value Disney World. Fellow Brevard teacher here! baby April though planning taking year off...in sense timing nice...while every sense bad! can't imagine going back year though, wish best luck! overlap COVID-19 deaths pneumonia deaths? statistical purposes, mutually exclusive? think burning one awesome catharsis, but, considering world responded disease, we're increasing globalization, climate change going stressing animal human populations- there's really good chance we'll seeing thses ""100 year"" plagues often see ""100 year"" floods.

Hold masks, consider creating pandemic response box necessary items next time. People care image life. Wearing mask covers image. connection narcissism society. 

Face life. Blood clots. Goddamn upset leave Valley economic circumstances, think got time. Editing math hard. Thanks friend. Everyone getting screwed PPE. Sure wife gets wear PAPR single use hood month share 2nd shift... Yeah one first ""wtf real"" moments COVID crisis. Every time seemed like getting better, another step back. There's still MUCH know lasting damage virus causes. terrifying. survived, think he'd ever same. would extremely difficult journey back semblance normalcy... even still, seemed like least someone side committed recovery. Thank answer!

It begs question hospitals near full capacity regular hospital business like broken legs influx covid cases came in? I've heard backlog people putting hospital visits earlier. case bunch stupid people bunch stupid things hospitals full covid-19 cases?

Same results...you got full hospitals. certainly changes narrative. You’re dumb Again, though, situations cited above--in scientific reports news articles--are totally different world away South Korean patients. 1/3 subsequent symptoms mild things going on, basically indicative residual issues damage initial infection. (And even see relapse supposed better immunological standpoint--it means body fully clearing virus, raises concerns immunological responsiveness least sub-grouping patients.) USS Theodore Roosevelt sailors first positive clinically serologically, negative clinically serologically, positive clinically serologically again, full-blown COVID-19 residual symptoms. either extremely severe relapse outright reinfection, raise questions sustained immune response. 

  original linked article notes basically thing, scientific article 

 

plus Koreatown case anecdotal reports covid19positive sub credible. South Korean cases one data point lot data points topic lining March findings others showing something different. IOW looks like cases ""long-haulers"" never fully cleared relapsing, also cases genuine reinfection positive, turned negative positive again. whether relapse reinfection indicates issues waning immunity return vulnerability. said above, think reason become overly pessimistic, mean we're likely going need longer term plan lot public health discipline, including international cooperation monitoring entries exits, truly bring control. everyone option unfortunately. Like mentioned, vasoconstrictors exist. used increase blood pressure, intentionally divert blood. diversion blood side effect, patients lost fingers toes result.

That said, result unwell, using muscles much, all, main non-essential organ group. non-essential oxygen nutrient use already low get. Hmm, sounds like work bribery city level. started blood clots. Bali Governor Wayan Koster held ""Pamahayu Jagat"" ceremony thanksgiving welcoming new normal implemented July 9th. ceremony held Besakih Temple, Karangasem Regency, Bali, Sunday (5/7), around 10:00 WITA.

Article 90 days. Holy shit. fuckers continue chant virus old kills old people. say FUCK YOU. Nick young healthy virus killed 3 months suffering. baby know father. Masks political, save lives. WEAR FUCKING MASK. lol, country recovering? age well. Apparently got blood clots legs; doctors couldn’t really use blood thinners led internal bleeding. 

Despite known primarily respiratory disease, COVID actually affects heart blood vessels well: privelaged

Check privilege.

NYC many things wrong...nursing homes biggest...ventilators second biggest...and leader like cuomo didn’t help. learned much since then. Thanks trying fight madness sub. thought South Korea second, reread title made sense. I'm Dallas. would say people wear mask. noticeable group people dont , usually minority. I’m disagreeing isn’t progress happening fast timeline, realistic.

Do know mutations virus? already identified infectious strain, fortunately believe virulence equivalent.

Hep C, CMV RSV vaccines well, even flu vaccine limited effect depending strain contract.

I suspect sars cov2 vaccine yearly vaccine. age safe? produce immune response older adults? 

I’m rapid timeline, there’s still lot learn. Italy lot Chinese run businesses north .. remember travel takes hours ... Also shock - blood pressure drops, blood flow extremities reduced. Pressors really hard extremities well. uncommon people sepsis lose fingers/toes/hands/feet. leg amputation due blood clots know gag account it’s real problem, beyond sad, picture real governor DeSantis saying something exactly like this. Wtf doing... first hospitalized NYC hospitals 20% mortality rate Covid-19 admissions. There's newer protocols gotten 3.5%, though may earlier interventions/higher patient awareness/lower case load. many studies shown kids really get shed virus?  Well, recall, ""news"" groups allowed knowingly lie Canada. That's step F*x... Damn right! Even can't deny there's something satisfying explosions bullets Okay, question:

I tested positive Covid19 10 days ago. fever-free 7 days rest symptoms subsided completely. Per provider, isolation 10 day period. However, live family includes 5 people awaiting test results.

My question is, need worried ""carrier"" virus even though already it? would like see girlfriend soon possible want make sure family risk. worried okay even family member comes back positive? Good job. People never really realize effort put forth crews like this. February.

Our president busy telling us problem, gone easter! Instead go vegan, go whole food plant based. pandemics started animal agriculture palm oil farms lead deforestation.

Vegans tend eat similar diet omnivores relation fat, carbohydrates protein. vegan start whole food plant based diet better health, better environment actually better animals due land use. monkeys picking coconuts coconut oil coconut water. 

So aim Whole plant food, produced locally mushrooms too! Think so-called Spanish Flu pandemic. killed around 650,000 Americans. Don’t know population back think impact many COVID deaths current population 330 million. doctor, best guess would went septic pneumonia. Sometimes sepsis lodge parts body, like joints organs. 

Again, 100% speculation part, that's could think of. June 8th 2 weeks Memorial Day... even telling. Americans discover basics hygiene. Absolutely! sad news.

In three months coma, ventilator, leg amputated, two strokes, developed holes lungs, sepsis, lost 65 lbs. ability move body. could communicate moving eyes down. Even survived many complications, would apparently need year-long in-patient stay rehab facility relearn eat, talk, move limbs, walk. 

Cold might sound, maybe let go peacefully weeks ago. would devastating, many people would want state months even potentially years? 

Make wishes known loved ones. yeah one effects covid actually funny say that, Fox labeled news, label *entertainment* even real news network spite says title Fox *News* ridiculous. way tell someone pre-symptomatic (highly likely spread virus) asymptotic (“less likely spread virus) wait patient experiences symptoms already late. gov needs step secure testing. amazing hard get revoked.

It doesn’t make correct either. 

We don’t know. goes ways, don’t dick.

There three BC licence plates block week. Go hell home. believe we're still backlogged. got testing Georgia Department Health took two weeks (and multiple phone calls) get results back. 

Our numbers certainly way worse even seem paper. Tell star! I'm working system yes.

Keeping ""isolated"" point basicly abandoning floating prison. like Alcatraz cruise ship even get provisions regular basis. New cases stop people want do. I'm going guess random Facebook posts Twitter source. Really important issue nobody really addressing.

Nursing home residents hospital need test negative twice discharged back adult care facility.

Many people tested every 24-48 hours test positive multiple times get two negatives.

Repeat positives counted new cases inflates number.

It’s encouraging deaths stagnating even though cases rising. know people love chaos bad news, it’s actually great news. We’re testing 6x many people mortality rate looks low. That's what, 4% total pay? Same. thinking earlier today told go check Amanda’s page updates. I’m sad. :( entirely deaths classified formal CDC system. Pneumonia disease, condition caused great many diseases. time, peoples' deaths categorized died pneumonia varied. One biggest causers pneumonia influenza. Sometimes death categorized ""pneumonia,"" somtimes ""influenza,"" sometimes something completely different (most pneumonia deaths extremely frail individuals multiple conditions). seemingly contradictor situation pneumonia deaths ""up"" places overall mortality even down. What's more, great many COVID deaths pneumonia. think even common final cause death COVID patients. Isn’t removing word “Two” title post bit misleading? says shocked hear administrators tell don’t want take advantage testing says eventually began asking why.   
  couple different answers, similarities among it’s going lot effort. like, ‘we don’t keep track everything drop UPS send out,” says.   also concerns state reimbursing them.   way, says it’s frustrating hear.   
   know, people dying. nursing homes assisted-livings like main hotspots deaths.” It’s 110 days. Shouldn’t clear fir them?? you’re interested history highly recommend book someone suggested months back “ Great Influenza” it’s pretty interesting telling pandemic things tried. Still trying process giant mass gatherings -- screaming, yelling, hugging, singing, half-arsed mask usage -- fine necessary pandemic, racism. reason cases spike NYC immunity March/April. 

Truly absurd. I’m sure conspiracy theory. It’s obviously possibility. cruise ships register foreign countries, helps avoid labor laws among things. Yes, agreed, year rushed. 

But mainly vaccine long market. Development, research, manufacturing, etc. COVID vaccine expected cut time significantly. 

So results mass human trials. Immediate side effects known year offering. like time period void everything never married lol? Except like Corona viruses one probably long term immunity, usually 6 months 5 years Corona virus.

The chadox vaccine seems aiming 1-2 years immunity, risk much slower spread never stops due various immunities ending without long term vaccine leave open second pandemic years.

Now hopefully nothing even remotely like happens that's risk large unvaccinated population I'm trying put words seems collective devastation loss person many us never previously herd of. makes sad. suffered much. wife suffered much. baby fatherless now. hope there’s peace whatever comes world. couldn’t manufacture masks. still don’t them. ya really think going manufacture many needles?  don’t use brain think? ""Doesn't explain nearly identical viruses found bats China. ""

96% far nearly identical. check see 96% similar make to. you’re brain washed still think covid deadly sickness healthy adults. LOL  Happy Cake Day!

Also, thanks, I'm worried all. giving suggestion. Also, waste resources know soon might need them?

And probably get downvoted, current Coronavirus kind blindsided us. main problem novel viruses reassortment fact RNA based genetic material usually prone mutation, may may play favor.

But, use arguing something like that. great day! honors student, I'll wager Still one connecting Harvard U Professor CoronaVirus 2 Chinese exchange students aiding research WuHan Bio Weapons research around time broke out. wetshop far lab.

They gave IV glucose anti nausea meds luckily slept off. 

It terrifying. definitely trying watch fight covid stomach virus led 911 call. daughter stomach virus. got 12 hours problem.

Let's give up. couple million concentration camps. school hasn’t even started yet Hang on, baby! gon get this! people Southern Missouri poorly served so-called leaders, presumably significant number voted numbskulls office. Let's hope get healthy dose buyers remorse along inevitable Covid-19 infection. Double lung transplant surgery. Absolutely terrible. Haha true.

People take cues around them. need critical mass people setting examples get come around. got March - please please keep good tabs mom. everyone else know got it, experience feeling better days keeps coming back hurting harder harder fading away. starts ineffective breaths dizziness get doc. I’m still right 3 months later. feel you. head hurts I'm New Zealand. even want think US right now. would literally banging wall. Ironically, gotten treated native Canada (and provincial health coverage), treatments surgeries would covered. referring manufacturing capacity. ok.  Tangentially related one mind blowing things reading field medicine doctors unlikely give pain medication African Americans.

I think also opioid epidemic massive problem white Americans, given prescriptions much higher rate AAs were. Ya may students losing scholarships drop semester also community college plan works underclassmen even majors. majority students shit professors jobs disappear. physics professor currently working grocery store this. Another Shed Life Rally, Darwins Theory best went days ago, awful. Even though masks required enter, 90% people gym didn’t wear masks. I’m going back anytime soon. Yesterday three years ago last week Didn’t American professionals tell us masks don’t work? ‘chain link fence stop mosquitoes’ message. get horsing issue. science change?  Hmmmm, sure researching interesting topic Fort Coronavirus Antiviral Drug Discovery Division Molecular Translational Sciences , United States Army Medical Research Institute Infectious Diseases , Fort Detrick , MD , USA. think Americans lived America long enough know impossible enforce used scare people. Thank you, friend ✌️ time someone says this, let know masks prevent Bill Gates' facial recognition working. Turn fear whatever deep state is, keeping people safe. frightening realistic scenario. It’s time reality checks preparedness measures. study Petrovsky et al. showing high human ACE-2 affinity implying forced natural selection? Northumberland county. Possibly fewer mask wearers couple month ago. deaths people feeling pretty safe. Definitely Ontario wearing masks. needs encouragement wear avoided issue far mean be. Replace ""young adults"" ""Americans."" university isn’t anything close far announced.  Atleast they're something diligent. Fuck all. horrible. Well MS DOS man. kids goddamn Windows. even masks. full fucking partying COVID around spiking like crazy country. US whole going prolong much longer kill many more. check Stat covid (and biopharma) news.

 

 step-sisters going disappointed Everybody wear mask. Government ask everybody wear mask role model behavior normalize it.

Mandating people wear masks yet another power states taken.

Many countries mandated surveillance citizens location via contact tracing apps (although use advanced system designs build database everybody's locations). actively discussed many states. Pretending surveillance part increase authoritarian precedent due Covid-19 pretty disingenuous. Protest move COVID numbers all. Multiple studies shown states. Stop blaming protest! Maybe governors got heads ass got serious people wear masks social distance numbers would go down.

I feel next two weeks see increases US due people going celebrating long weekend. seen many news posts showing people country parties without masks many people around plus beaches (where open) parks crowded. Nope. It’s always pay half insurance pays office pays rest it’s variable obviously trying give simplified answer. really don’t know disagreeing it’s set amount pay rest isn’t responsibility. truly sorry hear this. We've tried nothing ideas. - Simpsons

Seriously? feeble attempt federal government. Nothing coordinated. state emergency states purchase PPE? federal government confiscating PPE? Pick lane. lot states would fine giving supplies states help needed. fact governors get receipts knowledge PPE sent criminal.

We still one worst hit countries, includes China, India, larger population! Why? US federal government decided joke. would gone months. nothing see.

Even federal testing, something would think could get right, hurting US government help facilities creating tests.

Can hear CDC Dr. Fauci best course action contain this? experts direct this, politicians?

I know say. US Government tried nothing, inept efforts cost us lives money.

Everyone White House kiss ass. think Canada needs start instituting visas/date entry Americans border keep track Americans within borders. visa/date entry good 48 hours. get caught window, deport restrictions future reentry Canada. doctors getting laid fired. might decide need them. Trump said magically go away!!! needs said!!!! Actually, procedure someone exit self-quarantine diagnosed covid? need get another test show negative? someone go house give test? people reported reinfected. speaking plural? different areas measles outbreaks. way knowing that. No. live Houston. husband nurse one major hospital systems. Hospitals absolutely capacity. husband's hospital entire icu filled, step units filled, portions becoming step units. There's always anywhere 10-30 (30!) COVID-19 patients waiting get bed ER. Maybe doctors short - nurses, respiratory techs, PCAs incredibly short. think actually taking care patients? really doctors. offering bonuses get oose work short staffed, burning workers. no. ""living"" Houston mean know happening. husband, friends, friends nurses coming home crying shower - trauma constant stream patients can't whole lot for, dying one nurse, lucky, side. Hospitals equipped prepared handle something like this. Surges handled days MOST. Surge capacity supposed case mass casualty situations natural disasters eventually slow end (within week 2 MAX) unimaginable dealing now, except prepared. going get worse. really trouble. get sick, injured, there's go. isn’t higher Damn. Yeah really problem (besides deciding fund hard). oppose forcing people onto one healthcare system, think everyone choice. international law? thought people fleeing stricken land, healthier countries required accept them.

Not always followed international law ourselves, past, mind you... absolutely breaks heart. don’t know else say. last three months must absolute hell him, wife loved ones. real lives. hoax. anything, he’s longer pain...fuck covid, fuck it. sub started r/china_flu spread world occupied r/coronavirus. Nope bit irish humor. keep truckin bud 👍 It’s true. Everyone reddit assumes everyone hardcore blue red. it’s mostly 10% sides middle 80% trying get laid. Kids going bars aren’t making political statement, notice 10s thousands protestors applauded politicians health officials decided must serious. Yeah, read news story able see hospital... 80th day. F. covid cause leg amputated, lose much weight? symptoms altitude sickness trekking Nepal, waking panicked pretty common, also exhausted able sleep.  I'm sure doctors tried took medication helped altitude sickness. wonder helps Covid Employees responsible cooking food, putting exits, cleaning establishments. also completely doable require employees wear masks.

This becomes challenge business expected control public. Like u/BeaversAreTasty mentioned- really enforce it? would mean workers(Often underpaid service workers) would need regularly start confrontations strangers. workers already putting additional risk trying avoid pandemic. Saying business going get shut controlling public can't happen. dangerous ask service workers police public. 

I believe laws could help. Police officers could give tickets similar parking tickets wearing mask. Maybe easy line report people violating law. course issues well. 

Free college, better education system could help get people educated course decades would hopefully see intelligent population less likely fall social media misinformation traps. really help us however. hell many tests? That's 3x per capita testing Colorado get done. terrible. go much fight hard pass away. RIP Nick several remaining requirements film crews, including regular Covid-19 testing, everyone working film living controlled bubble environments, rules meant minimize contacts people. 

....okie dokie YAY! :D initial studies showed vitamin helped. sure true is, helps, helps. maybe placebo protect you. third fourth State country lockdown. Sorry ambiguous. true school want mandate masks simply would force school provide without think that's ridiculous. parent I'd happy donate money masks like donate school supplies teachers start every year. 

I suspect also political parents may want children forced wear masks. Excluding hyperbole, virus behinds donkeys, I'm right you! ;) thought virus hoax!!!  live Arizona, group ER residents nurses know practicing salsa along handful friends, masks anyone. Facts? death totals dropping ten straight weeks now. People desperately need start afraid virus.

Your optimism toxic situation. masks work well expect NFL games 70k people stands (except Miami Jacksonville). crept 7% going higher... yeah, mostly LA... I’m super introverted news affecting mental health cousin's mother-in-law died still posting 20 times day much hoax is. always dip-shit though. Fuck man. dude suffered. Meanwhile douches like Brendan Schaub fly Texas Arizona spread come back home.

If reading this, look Brendan Schaub. joke comedian, shit MMA fighter, keeps downplaying covid despite testing positive.

Fuck. sucks good people lost covid deniers roam unharmed Everyone mentioning putting care want COVID I’m concerned people tested positive COVID cannot see health provider produce negative test take months. 

I'm concern could lead minor acute problems due COVID even unrelated acute ailments treated turning severe chronic issues. emergency room option, people delay care gets really bad. say long term complications mild asymptomatic COVID start become apparent, wonder role delay care play it. things could picked routine screening. I'm sick argument essential workers go back.

Do think currently building, daycare, hospital, restaurant, store looks like seven times day passing period? many situations right people forced go work 35 people 20 x 30 room poor ventilation. switching group meeting 6 different times different sets people. Breathing other's fumes windows poor ventilation. Sharing restrooms day. Sharing desks pencil sharpeners lab supplies. I've always purchase Clorox wipes Kleenex runs first nine weeks. 

1500 kids middle school alone hallways look like. single establishment since lockdown looks like THAT. Hospital workers right safe, grocery store workers, students teachers. think every right make sure school district government plan place keep us safe. means, send us back. least make sure basic PPE like face masks disinfectant. Hire enough staff help us clean. 

I wish everyone would stop saying teachers bitch want go back work start trying think solutions us. kids deserve safe. sad. put fight! really hoping he'd pull through. RIP. not, now. going happen insurance companies 'cover' treatment get bailed government. 

So basically terribly inefficient single-payer system many expensive steps... one thing (well, also dialysis). Also vasopressors keep blood pressure focuses blood flow viral organs extremities getting enough oxygenated blood putting risk clots necrosis Schools ordered open time live CA time without delay, sadly seems people make decisions care image let industries literally bully trusting science.

They’re also talking teachers rotate though classes instead students going different classrooms, masks required (maybe) plexiglass desks. sure I’ll choose, it’s really hard learn online without bored don’t feel challenged all. really? much would spend it? think insurance companies want cover it? people dont even go dr theyre sick, there's incentive. people barely get flu shot, u think people gonna barging doors common cold shot? I'd hardly call voluntary. Full lockdowns necessarily needed, opening everything back normal stupid. do, distrust gates silly framework million times over. Lockdown testing. order online curbside pickup. case fatality rate, i.e., deaths divided cases since start pandemic (per worldometers.info):

Global: 536,843 / 11,563,004 = 0.046 = 4.6% 
US: 536,843 / 2,982,928 = 0.044 = 4.4% 

So claims killing 0.5% infected either wrong, referring different measures. Google it!!!

In news search, type coronavirus lungs brain/kidney/blood clots/neurological/organ damage. etc. you’ll find tons articles like TLRD: 27 Children study sample MIS-C 4 developed neurological problems.

Yes, DeWine Ohio could fit story too. Initially praised getting ahead many states lockdowns, criticised opening early quick. reality Ohio unemployment insurance fund running dry, little choice. Well, originally, seemed think fatality rate may 2% range seem predicting IFR 0.5-1% so, yes, bad thought. extrapolating real rare effects common. need look overall prevalence issues /r/covid19positive anywhere close representative sample. wear mask stores one says anything. ☺️ probably higher.

Can’t scared forever, Libz!!!!!!1111122 polio vaccine gave whole lot people polio pretty bad long term issue ones going force ..... put one it’s effective, basic common sense.... it’s left right thing ... virus doesn’t care. That’s needed increase ICU capacity, train additional nurses able look Covid Patients ICU. plenty time. countries done this. can’t train critical care nurse five minutes train nurse specific critical care tasks Covid patients time prepare. awful tragedy warning there. country state extra 230 icu beds didn’t December waiting used. getting spike cases ready treat them. furious behalf US citizens first world country resources tackle literally killing citizens due assume combination incompetence assume culture war bullshit. small businesses know didnt get it. shitshow many places didnt get it. scary thing could see Trump though. Carpet bombing democratic cities mean him. Everything awful right now, need wear mask least next 6 months, isolated next 3 (at least), career likely irreparably damaged. 

Everything said things need start processing grieving join rest us fixing this. luxury humoring sensitivity right now- sucks, sucks us, things thousands upon thousands people die choking death alone halls hospitals. quote first thing thought saw headline. Damnit, well california. Incorrect mostly kill people 50. Younger folks face lifelong debilitating lung capacity reduction certainly cause complications line resulting earlier grave quality life go down. say that. Hitler's propaganda evolved starting point fearmongering all-out racism. Idk people I've heard calling hoax boomers. go Nextdoor app area. Young people may social life parents bad. Keep good work Governor, may made state attractive people relocate. It’s obvious you’ve never “positive stereotype” applied you. way actually plays real life isn’t positive all.  disagree this, able create first flu vaccine decades ago, much harder flu mutates much faster coronavirus. yes flu vaccine like 30-60% effective. since coronavirus changes slower, anymore difficultly creating coronavirus vaccine. especially scientific advances since first flu vaccine. coronavirus vaccine probably effective flu vaccine. created safe effective vaccine one strain, able create vaccine next strain much quicker based vaccine first strain. also probably something similar flu vaccines, make effective 3 different strains.

if believe coronavirus mutate similar rate average flu virus, show proof. can't, shut it. i'm getting tired people like saying ""we never vaccine bc that"" pretty much whole world putting much money, research effort it. dare say ""Well, never created vaccine past coronavirus before"" answer that, died could finish testing vaccines. believe good chance able finish testing vaccines ton spread look like going away anytime soon, especially U.S, U.S good testing place this, including South Africa, Brazil. stay makeshift bed halls. worst cases happened yet worst deaths certainly has. Maybe lot vulnerable got taken already. Yeah except \*as\* fucked COVID. good article comparing them: second wave 1918 Flu significantly worse virus mutated deadlier. highly unusual, viruses almost usually mutate [less We're already starting see now; Texas COVID strain contagious OG Italian one however less people dying. Don’t viruses mutate weaker form lot time? Couldn’t case? missing something? Asking honestly. Yeah that's bullshit, probably things could done bacterial pneumonia slammed. Assume it. Thats Im doing. don’t think it’s matter common sense. It’s plain ignorance 

We saw spring break videos everyone saying “I don’t care get it” “if it’s time die guess I’ll die” favorite “if god wants die die”

Some fucking ignorant idiots Countless home health care workers older Black women earning $8 $9 hour. can’t afford adequate PPE, employers provided any. 

My state, done relatively well flattening curve, announced “hope” distribute masks home health care workers reimbursed Medicaid toward end August. horrendous oversight, that’s is. 46k students.  Higher ""Beaters"" whack spreaders neck increasing intensity leave put mask on. (But then, someone would follow spreader around store, make sure take mask sight.) Ah! forgot! I’ve doomed us all!

Honestly, I'd like selling alcohol public consumption completely banned. FOREVER. would help reduce drunk driving, people raping/molesting drunk people, etc. addition reducing spread disease.  Actually, Texas deaths increase last two weeks. Put seven day make bit clearer. increased 20 36 recently. Problem near yet, could well get number higher crazy world live in. Parents going forced go back work unemployment benefits stop getting extended, can't make without daycare. Schools less need reopen kids neglected.

In ideal (non-American) world, would've done better job COVID sending kids school guarantee teachers get sick. Sadly, that's world live in, expect we're going forced back work, wonder right answer forcing schools reopen. Good luck construction gig schooling! always hated ""we get eventually"" mentality. Yea EVENTUALLY depending EVENTUALLY is, could affect level/effectiveness treatment virus, knowledge death/complication rate it. want get later rather now. kid's dad? Gotta say, anything gonna packed, I'd rather outdoors indoors. People congregate somewhere matter what, can't anything unless send people door-to-door inspecting, though crowded lakes good, they're better crowded bars houses. worst behind us gets worse every day? finite number experienced trained ICU doctors nurses. far limiting resource this. It’s specialty already works hard spread thin normal times. doesn’t take much overwhelm system. would argue hospital redeploying less qualified nurses doctors care critically ill patients already overwhelmed (this happened NY), regardless may appear outside. 100 empty hospital beds might well zero overwhelmed nurses doctors assigned them. He's one US's popular politicians, despite corporate media DNC's constant smearing undermining.  
I put much faith suppressed rigged voting results, use covid, combined w/ dem's refusal set mail voting, pressure Bernie drop prematurely. one likes Biden lose Trump, deservedly. I'll voting Green, alongside vote all. I’d love read literature mention. “our” “our measurements?” unemployed worth risk.

If universal basic income, wouldn’t worth risk then. many hospitalized? good news, battle far here. Numbers slowly rise story young adults everywhere else throughout country. We've already first wave restrictions put back place due crowds bars, imagine restrictions pipeline. I'm glad proactive governor, unfortunately always deal endless amount arrogant assholes refuse wear mask. one would look numbers Sweden comes close top Europe one worst case scenarios. Low testing percentages extensive amount people infected, one highest death rates per 1M. praise? practically watched hospitals filled nothing contain infections.

The handling epidemic political Sweden, coming praising one worst cases really mind boggling. Sweden practically used covid reduce population retirement save fiscal crisis. Belgium, Italy, Spain scored nearly bad Sweden.

So telling us now? US nothing hide, would suppressing information. China wants hold international investigation this, hope US co-operates. didn’t anyone think March? add #1, pervasive spread elder care facilities...yet. That's half reported deaths early states originated. spray tan thought saw headline week ago? happened? know be. I'm 31 father gives stern talking every time mention vote (he asks constantly). refuse see differently, indeed put drop water public swimming pool. thinking virus get neurological system wreak havoc well. Coronavirus masks related? Could've fooled wish store work would close bathroom public. avoid costs work there. Day day like revolving door obese people taking shits. Good you! Prioritize health Yes no. Obviously huge portion job Evaluate Treat post surgical Orthopedic patients, good portion elderly people live home independently, experiencing balance problems, elderly people injured want get back surfing, running, golfing, well high school college sports injuries require surgery. Schools closed, surgeries stopped, seniors community want catch deadly virus going PT clinic. went working 3-5 days week literally I've worked 4 hours since March 15th. small store Toronto allow 1 person inside, let alone browse.

Eh? see all... yet still can’t vote mail  said like gotcha means 500,000 deaths big deal? 

I said covid dangerous originally feared great thing. thinking one point 1.7 million Americans might die Covid19. I’m sever asthmatic. countless nights fighting air. hope one knows feeling breathing narrowed passages better me. It’s awful. 
In breath, (no pun intended) rode around entire island Manhattan course hours sweltering heat mask on.

This load shit.  Imagine thinking mask stops molecular oxygen carbon dioxide, also thinking virus pass problem. would tell use brain, probably one. Fauci’s slouch either. Dude’s 80 still runs lot every day Honestly? nurse areas saw blatantly people ignoring every guideline would quit. People always way wind blowing.  people like make simple things complicated, wear masks quarantine, number drop significantly. everything America. piece chastising lack mask wearing UK, know talk Americans subreddit, carry on... Got tested earlier month symptoms. Took eight days called every couple days initial 72 hour wait. put callback list day 7 call, did. Luckily negative waiting eight days COVID could devastating. ages matter! know point making here. weak wear mask, covid gonna kill you. obviously young person. Older people get annoyed narrative. older lives less important? older people sacrificed? insane theory let old disabled people die protect young. Maybe one day older realise awful feels popular consensus life expendable. Yes, yes should.
If interested, look 'Baby lab - bias study'  sort depend son socialization experience doesnt it?
there many horrible times school permanently damaged it.

There many reasons think time family home far better socialization experience.

not mention exposure harmful drugs practices take place school.
I think anyone really done good conclusive study shows socialization school better family environments. post shit every topic, whether it’s related not. /s  month two school back massive outbreaks half teachers leave quarantine even hospital dead, what?

We're dumb Florida. People still support him? talking vaccines take years unless fast tracked, yet get new flu vaccine year. different? be?

because flu vaccine already created, time, created vaccine based know work safe, tweak different strain, usually three strains flu vaccine.

with coronavirus, nothing base vaccine vaccine before. know works, dont. yes vaccines they're working on, based SARS MERS vaccines wasnt able finished testing vaccines. really know safe works. they're able create vaccine able show safe works beyond doubt, able next vaccine new coronavirus, much faster. basing whats already works safe. way flu vaccines. Actually true .detected positives per day 5 times announced.

Also, actually home part besides occasional grocery store run picking restaurant admit I've seen one friends couple times past months. They'll more. rest sorta work, tho, tossed clots leg enough require amputation, also probably sent organs like well. didnt least small strokes I'd surprised. vice versa well trying understand illness is. think powers REALLY piss-poor job explaining it. SARS-type infection meaningless me, many people, I’d bet. 

We understand cold. understand flu. come understanding Covid lung disease tends toward pneumonia, result that, plus awful complications. (If wrong, please correct me.)

What doctors health authorities told us is, “this highly contagious pneumonia disease.” think may made sense.

I think kind rhetoric may greater impact people. Saying “Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome” meaningless masses. 

So. boyfriend, deep love respect you—not—yelled don’t want risk PNEUMONIA complications. It’s cold. It’s flu. It’s lung disease causes pneumonia shitstorm human body. Sometimes. 

And fact, medical folks said MILD case covid *include* pneumonia. 

If correct thinking, maybe correcting people say”it’s flu/it’s cold” “nah. It’s pneumonia” perhaps slap upside peoples’ heads may give second’s pause. Maybe. definition “recovered”? 

Here US, groups Facebook sites thousands people listed “recovered” still can’t walk stairs, work, live normal life battle virus. doesn’t seem like “recovered” me. I’ve lost weight due stress make free. otherwise riots. start now? Senate acquit. see first paragraph article without nyt subscription.

Schools grown expensive faster anything else except healthcare. fault schools, employers. Teachers don’t make more, college isnt 5 years instead 4, bloat however much money schools charge, people lining pay it. 

There room price college competition, aren’t motivated compete right now. I’m suggesting motivate them. Booo, like people spry damn spit everywhere unmasked!

Yeah, find there’s surprising amount “experts” Reddit, especially infectious disease. Don’t even get started threads saw early pandemic amateur engineers convinced could jerryrig ventilator alarm clock. Separation federal state one main culprits. 

We need leader.... 400 quasi leaders.

One thing sure, beautiful nation shown weakness. Oh, panic buy def real order.. guy tray full beers still legendary looking like Oxford-AstraZenaca vaccine, traditional vaccine one phase 3 global trials likely one going win out. also largest supply chain place, production running. clinical trials far actually look promising. Basically, looking like likely vaccine, looking effectiveness numbers. 

The likely scenario people get three vaccines. 1. Astra Zenaca. 2. BCG Booster (TB vaccine), 3. MMR booster. reason second 2 boost overall immune response. 

The mRNA vaccine big question. highly experimental, Oxford one pretty traditional. would feel pretty safe taking oxford one worries. I've felt way since 14. yeah total nonsense diseases work Unlike federal government, states sock money away rainy day fund. sort crisis government supposed provide continuity through.

It seems reasonable hypothesis, secret services ones working negating it. Really good way look it. Still don’t see sources everyone catches likely damaged life. Show I’ll gladly read it.

Webmd fine source general vein wikipedia is. Gives good general idea one go explore sources. source gave. Go ahead go read today news webmd site - scroll way back want. go scroll last 4 months r/covid19 show missed “everyone catches doomed” research.

Its I’ve ever seen. people catch don’t get sick enough go hospital. aren’t sick enough go hospital recover normal.

There point - long haulers - juncture unlucky compared much larger total infection numbers. even able hospital. heartbreaking. Yeah haven’t seen death rate follow massive spike infections yet latest wave. whole family back NY got recently (3weeks ago) they’ve minor symptoms well asymptomatic. Lots noses incorrect mask usage Dallas :( one strain Covid. Oh Hurricane season coming, imagine category 4 hitting Florida Texas southern state year? now... actualy behave like animals Interesting. Well, maybe cops stopped murdering Black people, would protests. 

Maybe affordable housing available impoverished communities, protests.

Maybe healthcare universally accessible, protests.

Maybe education system function way directed absurd number Black students towards prison system, protests. 

The list goes on. talk protests unless also want fix root issues. Broken systems actively continuing kill Black people (and broadly, BIPOC) along coronavirus. Interesting thank you.

It’s funny.... this, viruses seemed simple boring. ordinary colds.... sometimes really bad, times mild annoyance. Sometimes flu going around, took half office (but usually not). then, “somewhere far away”, crazy scary viruses (Ebola etc.). 

We cavalier viruses, created world enabled new virus go everywhere almost immediately.

From stretch DNA linked Covid-19 passed Neanderthals 60,000 years ago, according new study.

Scientists don’t yet know particular segment increases risk severe illness coronavirus. new findings, posted online Friday yet published scientific journal, show clues modern health stem ancient history.

“This interbreeding effect happened 60,000 years ago still impact today,” said Joshua Akey, geneticist Princeton University involved new study.

This piece genome, spans six genes Chromosome 3, puzzling journey human history, study found. variant common Bangladesh, 63 percent people carry least one copy. Across South Asia, almost one-third people inherited segment

Elsewhere, however, segment far less common. 8 percent Europeans carry it, 4 percent East Asia. almost completely absent Africa.

It’s clear evolutionary pattern produced distribution past 60,000 years. “That’s $10,000 question,” said Hugo Zeberg, geneticist Karolinska Institute Sweden one authors new study.

One possibility Neanderthal version harmful getting rarer all. It’s also possible segment improved people’s health South Asia, perhaps providing strong immune response viruses region.

“One stress point pure speculation,” said Dr. Zeberg’s co-author, Svante Paabo, director Max Planck Institute Evolutionary Anthropology Leipzig, Germany.

Researchers beginning understand Covid-19 dangerous people others. Older people likely become severely ill younger ones. Men risk women.

Social inequality matters, too. United States, Black people far likely white people become severely ill coronavirus, example, likely due part country’s history systemic racism. left Black people high rate chronic diseases diabetes, well living conditions jobs may increase exposure virus.

Genes play role well. Last month, researchers compared people Italy Spain became sick Covid-19 mild infections. found two places genome associated greater risk. One Chromosome 9 includes ABO, gene determines blood type. Neanderthal segment Chromosome 3.

But genetic findings rapidly updated people infected coronavirus studied. last week, international group scientists called Covid-19 Host Genetics Initiative released new set data downplaying risk blood type. “The jury still ABO,” said Mark Daly, geneticist Harvard Medical School member initiative.


The new data showed even stronger link disease Chromosome 3 segment. People carry two copies variant three times likely suffer severe illness people not.

After new batch data came Monday, Dr. Zeberg decided find Chromosome 3 segment passed Neanderthals.

About 60,000 years ago, ancestors modern humans expanded Africa swept across Europe, Asia Australia. people encountered Neanderthals interbred. Neanderthal DNA entered gene pool, spread generations, long Neanderthals became extinct.

Most Neanderthal genes turned harmful modern humans. may burden people’s health made harder children. result, Neanderthal genes became rarer, many disappeared gene pool.


But genes appear provided evolutionary edge become quite common. May, Dr. Zeberg, Dr. Paabo Dr. Janet Kelso, also Max Planck Institute, discovered one-third European women Neanderthal hormone receptor. associated increased fertility fewer miscarriages.

Dr. Zeberg knew Neanderthal genes common today even help us fight viruses. modern humans expanded Asia Europe, may encountered new viruses Neanderthals already evolved defenses. held onto genes ever since.

Dr. Zeberg looked Chromosome 3 online database Neanderthal genomes. found version raises people’s risk severe Covid-19 version found Neanderthal lived Croatia 50,000 years ago. “I texted Svante immediately,” Dr. Zeberg said interview, referring Dr. Paabo.

Dr. Paabo vacation cottage remote Swedish countryside. Dr. Zeberg showed next day, worked day night posted study online Friday.


“It’s crazy vacation I’ve ever cottage,” Dr. Paabo said.

Tony Capra, geneticist Vanderbilt University involved study, thought plausible Neanderthal chunk DNA originally provided benefit — perhaps even viruses. “But 40,000 years ago, now,” said.

It’s possible immune response worked ancient viruses ended overreacting new coronavirus. People develop severe cases Covid-19 typically immune systems launch uncontrolled attacks end scarring lungs causing inflammation.

Dr. Paabo said DNA segment may account part people Bangladeshi descent dying high rate Covid-19 United Kingdom.

It’s open question whether Neanderthal segment continues keep strong link Covid-19 Dr. Zeberg researchers study patients. may take discoveries segment ancient fossils modern humans understand became common places others.


But Dr. Zeberg said 60,000-year journey chunk DNA species might help explain it’s dangerous today.

“Its evolutionary history may give us clues,” Dr. Zeberg said.

Carl Zimmer writes “Matter” column. author thirteen books, including “She Mother's Laugh: Powers, Perversions, Potential Heredity.” @carlzimmer • Facebook Pretending forcing people wear masks seen public tracking citizen’s locational data pretty disingenuous. Please attack points actually make. 

If you’re public don’t mask, deserve fine, amount proportional income/net worth. 

The states lot powers. good, aren’t. It’s smart plan say states shouldn’t given powers powers bad. examined issue-to-issue basis, ramifications power used nefariously always considered. 

So exactly nefarious part forcing people wear masks public global pandemic? one seems answer pointing different, entirely separate issues. dont know ppl dismiss everything China... consume western media... mostly (UK,US,Aus) isnt idea brainwashed?? least Chinese ppl see viewpoints thru vpn... voluntary want join thre firefighting teams. Entirely voluntary. Right now? You’re trying stay positive *right now*?

Your positivity toxic insult doctors nurses currently worked death keeping death rate spiraling control. buried lead till end: 

“Overall, number emergency room visits COVID-19 influenza-like illnesses steadily increasing since June 8, records show.

Still, Florida remains within target goals hospital staffing, Health Department said.

As Sunday, state reported 26 percent availability hospital beds 34 percent availability beds Florida’s intensive care units.”

Note ICUs generally always operate 60-70% capacity Okay...and help way containing virus now? Placing blame wasting time. Well don’t know. recall beaches closed due elevated E.coli levels. Especially problem nude beaches. 

Actually, maybe could cure crowded beaches. Stay logic now- crowd beaches. Lock beach bathrooms. Therefore poop ocean. E.coli levels rise dangerous levels. Beach closed. 🤔 r/LegalAdvice mean kinda place there. first comment trying prevent next one, go say way preventing them. suggest leave know doing, think good idea find source probably good idea. Article correct long store offers reasonable accommodation. Sadly many smaller business desperate business look way instead enforcing mask requirement Okay... don’t know anyone started really social distancing Whitmer’s stay home order went effect towards end March. March coronavirus really virus China countries maybe parts U.S. We’ve 10 straight weeks declining deaths lol. It’s holiday thing 9 apocalypse going happen. Again, say someone went full prep &amp; lockdown mode back January (which include beefing security). Back then, data see outcome going be. data now. look survival rates, recovery rates, antibody test rates, well measure behavior throughout see infrastructure going break.

I spent tens thousands dollars prep this. absolutely clear me, prepped. I'm fine that. fine going mindset worst case scenario meant buy supplies year two, and/or donating supplies. donate yearly income anyway.

I know else say. I'd love able say something like, ok survive, know level going follow guidelines reduce risk. say follow guidelines follow general best practices risk COVID low. terms infrastructure, see data changes lead breakdown. thinking thing. story story suffering. wife going back forth thinking he’s going die one day live next. watching body get destroyed more. I’m relieved suffering over. can’t even imagine pain family yet experience least don’t go watching suffer anymore. I’m parent two small kids loved this!! I’ve decided homeschool them, least fall. looking forward too. kids happy. miss friends we’ve kept fun them. I'd shocked changed mind this. pandemic opened many, many eyes.

Let's flip Senate seats well. feels bit reactionary. egregious examples super-spreading events? Unfortunately, yes. LA implemented full-scale lockdowns? No.

But doesn’t mean it’s complete utter disaster here. Bars closed. Restaurants closed indoor dining. Beaches closed weekend. vast majority neighborhood seems wear masks, even walking dogs/riding bikes. went local park 4th pretty much everyone social distancing wearing masks. also drive quite bit weekend, people wearing masks (although observe two instances made cringe due larger groups/limited mask wearing). 

LA’s clearly heading wrong direction, isn’t level willful ignorance see communities. us pronounce ""Misery"", thanks. haven’t able get antibody test yet - I’m currently broke work since started. hope get one ASAP, also hearing they’re accurate I’m surprised hear didn’t detected. used buy jeans khakis TJ Maxx $40 felt like quality price. normally $100 though? I'd never pay full price them... economic ramifications could last 10 years. would think world would stable vaccine well that. classmate college passed away, yesterday apparently. 25. father apparently passed away last week. 

This joke. wish people thought humans, lives taking. They're numbers statistics... Must shitty university. I'm adjunct students great hiring/retention rates. Yes, please! love attitude America needs of. Carng beyond immediate family community large. minor inconvenience individual, yet prevent many others getting sick. agree Trump utterly despicable, disagree MI vs AZ comparison.

MI 670 deaths per 1M pop.
AZ 250 deaths per 1M pop.

So, quite reasonable point MI success story point AZ government failure.

My current take US situation this:

a. northern states NY,NJ,MA,MI,CT hit fast even chance lock down. near/close enough herd immunity levels

b. rest country lock time, lockdown successful enough stabilize and, likely, even reduce new cases (testing increase 10x-100x so) nearly hard enough eradicate.

After 3 months shutdown, way start opening.

The bad part state lock near peak, it'll overwhelmed deaths much higher would otherwise.. everyone world laughs 

The lack self awareness makes even hilarious getting 20k cases day late March early April started pumping 2k+ deaths days good article webmd Current news collected 

on another topic - seriously, webmd source? covid info??? new internet?

I'm sure update every year ""However, early estimates predict overall COVID-19 recovery rate 97% 99.75%."" --- no, one predicts overall recovery rate 99.75%, writers may want check what's going 2020.

Find sources timely info want accurate information. feel like sometimes everyone world playing prank go join everyone fun living lives there? tell “If nobody else going grownup, it’s part” continue staying home? that’s wife feel. toddler kid early elementary. One condition could make coronavirus worse. People never talk lot people get long-term lung scarring breathing issues. rarely get curbside food pickup, see tons old people pouring restraints laughing good ol’ time masks. see people lining doors. Packed parking lots shopping malls drive by. current infection amount 10x higher lockdown easily climbing. hate everything right now. believe it. models built last longer. Look cats dogs live 20-30 years vs average 10-15 years lifespan.

Probably means. Cruises wack fuck anyway. go lol literally eradicated polio without that, tho? 

We need enough vaccine vaccinate enough people. one vaccine massively scalable, great. vaccines sufficiently scalable combination, great.

but no, ""need"" ton different vaccines work. need ton effective vaccine. Missouri: Show Stupid State described trolley problem. Intervene save 5 lives kill different person intervene let 5 people die take action kills 1 person.

There's correct answer. Many look national state new cases deaths give whole story. many small counties like Yakima, WA Covid-19 every bit bad Los Angeles, CA worse. Let’s admit it. programs undervalued, like Engineering, overvalued, like English/Literature. pre-existing condition? Something addup seems healthy prob shape performing stage...any addictions alcohol? $130 billion left deadline hit. House Senate extended deadline. problem getting funds forgiven business. Many business better closing rather operating even larger loss. despicable, unforgivable behavior.

Plus antibody titer really interesting topic go context sars cov2. Oftentimes patients confirmed infection measurable, low, antibody level. led increased research role innate immunity rather B cell response body fights virus. also goes might making mistake many vaccines using spike protein it’s target.

I love social events I’ve lost 10 pounds. I’m thriving. MD seeing covid cases.

CDC hospital recommendations are:
Quarantine least 10d since symptoms first started
AND
at least 3d fever (with antipyretics) symptoms improving (cough/SOB, don’t resolved) 

So could mean you’d fine stop quarantining day 10 resolved day 5, might quarantine 14d symptoms hadn’t improved lot Patterns repeat themselves. Mossouri mini Texas.

Cant even stay tesco past ten let alone go pub  Lucky citizens started shooting officials yet, mean? So, people pay attention scientific community saying thing awhile now? Ty According Facebook overwhelmingly boomers talking rights bitching masks/being told do. appears opinion piece. 1) testing. IQ testing, would way stupid people. 2) playbook treatment getting better.

I think comes paid sick leave. people still working US, many didn’t paid sick leave US face difficult decision. What’s covid stroke reason increased deaths. 


Sizable chunk world’s population shuttered inside homes, stepping essential supplies. Although may reduced chances exposed coronavirus, may less obvious effect immune systems leaving us vulnerable infections. someone virus stop in, crap, leave without infecting anyone?

Seems unlikely, given transmission likely explanation one day's sample got contaminated?

I would believe one study, multiple results different countries explanation becoming harder believe. People infectious unknowingly spread even feeling unwell. weekend lag indication cases slowing down. see interventions impact 2 weeks since today's cases people got tested last week even earlier case, medically viable option though I'm sure good Dare fear. sorry dealing that. infuriating Wtf really? I'd heard antibody plasma showing promising results. source? Yeah hard find info. around 15% posative recently 1.5 million evidence peer reviewed even published yet. Let's pretend known fact even reading ""evidence"" finding consensus whether legitimate. Fingers crossed get effective revolution! :D ""It's China, that's here.""

""Italy's hit hard, that's Europe.""

""Oh no, NYC really disaster, let's see plays here.""

etc. That's play again, guarantee. Especially much pressure parents get kids back school (well specifically cases: house).

And unsurprisingly turns shitshow, ""WhO cOulD sEeN cOmInG??"" death rate covid Sweden among highest Europe. I'd call failure. Swedes blocked entering country till seriously deal live epidemic.

I surprised Swedes take streets burn ministries responsible genocide caused. Well, gay men New York responsible spreading AIDS, can't COVID? COVID-cornholio anyone? Good luck - must American. camps UK. Pay 3-4k 2 weeks isolation. Yes, are. constitutional republic literally democracy. constitutional monarchies (and republics) Europe.

Otherwise, thing democracy.

Democracies limited narrow definition. Colorado's positive rate \~5%. we're quite well testing. 

it easy get tested Colorado. still feel way mid-late June. public service job background important. Firefighters routinely placed situations could commit crimes like theft. Please literally millions volunteer firefighters previous training would kill career spot. Probably another masshole jealous Michigan legitimately deaths whereas Massachusetts computing error death count made look like 0 deaths.

I’m saying kids going catch die- I’m saying it’s prudent use caution throw children back school without plan. served. takeout food thrown trash. allowed purchase anything. tantrum break things, they're arrested. present one idiotic ADA/HIPAA cards, they're mocked idiots.

Consequences. buy drink bar restaurant without wearing shirt shoes February 2020 health reasons around decades.  July 2020, we're facing millions potentially dying, also wear mask. Oh well. NY's surge coordinated competent governor, Cuomo. listened doctors scientist. strong armed president send USS Mercy hospital ship NYC harbor. Somehow see Abbot that. seems favor pleasing superiors helping people elected him. 

Next point, NYC complete shutdown. traffic, people streets, people drinking bars, even then, NYC reach peak infections almost 3 weeks later hospitals began offload patients satellite stations. Mass graves dug, many deaths occured once. I'm fear mongering, facts. 

Texas right shutdown, people refuse wear masks, social distancing, think happen next weeks? 

I know Texas resilient turn things around, first step take virus seriously. imagine absurd going sound history books. ""Even evidence masks made huge difference like countries like Japan, people around world refused simply task wearing one possibly save life others"". sad times friends. see graph hospitalization data state country? Brilliant point. well said. mass protests everywhere including big cities Canada. city Calgary recorded single covid case related protests 3 weeks ago.

Nope 40 year old father 2....I wish sugar daddy. think (for profit owners) triage patients like Italy. Judge good chance recovery give beds them. Good luck older people medical conditions likely die. Amen, brother Please, tell us really feel :) Also said people dying taking contribute, totally wrong. Pensioners might taking alot they've spent entire lifetime contributing paying taxes sorts ways. Nobody deserves die, everyone protected. Lol Really? Nasty. actually meant good getting subpoenas standing  craziness change. 

And, HAIRY PSLAMS- hope get deserve good thing :) I’m essential worker wouldn’t think striking. There’s nothing afraid of. three month lock many places testing increased.

I hope baseline holds hospitalizations shooting across many states I’m hopeful. 

We went lock back normal.
We gone lock new normal mask use restrictions crowded events places. I've thinking lot, I've come conclusion maybe people embarrassed wear masks. Makes sense whatsoever, people refuse wear bike/motorcycle helmets fashion/""freedom"" reasons, too. college work students degree certification programs campus now. hands-on type like nursing, EMT, dental hygiene, etc. case positive EMT student, dental hygiene student test positive. building. shut mon afraid gonna turn orgy remember first started wearing mask March people stores gawking like kook.

Like sewerage sample means likely humans or? say it, behind want disloyal president wearing mask ""group"" belong wear masks.  agree false sense safety security many people willed greatly contributed situation, it’s cause. lot infections occur workplace consistent exposure. lot factors, avoidable. 

The problem keeping everything “open” contributes delusion safety got us begin with. People see stores restaurants open, forget risks focus immediate short term satisfaction eating out, shopping, socializing. Shutting things would create reset expectation. wouldn’t even need long imo, could mostly used halt behavior leading increase infections long enough put orders place protect public; primarily enforceable mandate masks. Ideally would get testing tracing fixed time know better even consider possibility ever get fixed. 

Another problem leaving everything open economic damage that’s done due decline consumer trust. Many businesses operate thin margins trying stay afloat 50-75% capacity already signing death warrant company that’s Target, Walmart, big box stores. think happen businesses people staying home don’t feel safe going anymore even less occupancy? 

Shutting things isn’t protect public health, also protect economic viability lot sectors. problem yet leadership right way. 

Tell companies furlough employees promise return, provide business forgivable loans contingent rehiring employees, pay unemployment workers it’s safe return work. provides safety business, workers, government people unemployment already job lined go back there’s risk forcing people life welfare. little enforcement highly doubt help much. 2 classes/labs went shutdown. went 100% online. One teacher, I've absolutely adore fine transitioning. new teaching really struggled. said feel like learn much either would learned classroom. I'm 1 summer class/lab feel like I'm really learning anything. physical science sends questions/problem sets basically Google since notes terrible. Simple, many deaths quickly approaching scores Belgium, Spain, Italy, quit testing deaths show covid19 related. 

The took chance based wild epidimiological hypothesis FAILED. case state failure meant thousands unnecessary deaths. would nice sick people feel need go go work would wear them. reminder President said thinks keep deaths ""100 thousand 200 thousand we're pretty good job."" went outlaw party last night. literally one wore (N95) mask dance floor. wind, dance floor makes extended close contact. sinking feeling people still think crazy wearing mask 7-10 days now... Depends mean airborne. think virus chills tiny water droplets breath linger air bit. yeah virus comes mouth nose put paper bag sugar daddy’s head enter Uh, yeah...just enforce masks social distancing, close closed social spaces (bars, etc.) throw offenders jail. Problem solved. making important decisions without facts always difficult.

But life often presents us choices. mention behavior problems, definitely include spitting coughing know that's arsenal. hol' freedom without remorse consequences Yeah, kept infection/death rates low.

And opened soon, infection rates spiking. ICU's getting maxed Florida Texas, soon California follow suit. trump level fingers ears going there.

Why assuming me.

I followed closely since Jan 20, taken seriously since then.

Factually many know January. seem missed argument, I'm correct regardless say.

Literally nothing say changes that. already objectively correct, I'm bit bored making look like complete dumbass. I’m fine plan stop protests too. beginning stay inside weeks wear masks. ppl keep fucking muy rights! say young people surging hospitalizations? It’s much sobering statistic. It’s also followed large percentage “survivors” (the 3 4) life-long debilitating illnesses catching COVID. FL's deaths heavily delayed reported. can't find read website something like day recently deaths April May.

The way report shit kinda confusing times lol.

For example. county(Pinellas) recorded 14 deaths today. look line list like 5 deaths July far. track deeply enough know exact date range reported deaths day def lifelike picture. Anyone Toronto need hire copywriter Master's degree? either doesn't; need tell us. sister got tested yesterday (we don’t know yet), said ONE hospital save employees. going postpone remaining dental work things still going well California. gum swelled up, realized can't postpone end rotting, painful teeth 6 months now, choose pain going worst pandemic. trying get finished, even may pick things put off.

Also must inform people nobody told wear chin straps. Cover noses folks! straight propaganda, can't believe sub even allows this. Lockdown killed extra 30,000 people first 6 weeks? Wow... That's fast acting societal trauma. dental cleaning scheduled tomorrow canceled it, I'm AZ much I'm sure dentist office taking precautions, seem like good idea.

So really, privileged students opportunities.

Especially hospitals/docters. Many still think cough/fever thing. really bad moments 2nd wave. felt times gonna make it.

it pisses go ER life death situation pull anxiety card send home vistaril say ""come back 2-3 days gets worse"". would make SOB chest pressure much worse. go back tell worse, pull anxiety card send home fucking vistaril say ""come back 2-3 days gets worse"". without looking could be.

They acted like tone deaf robots seem care look covid ""reopened"" gone like POOF, even though never truly real ""lockdown"". half ass recommendation lockdown real shit actually hit. nobody wants lockdown ""we already that""

After 11 ER visits 3 different hospitals, gave going back hospital. many medical bills docters trying mindfuck believing ""just anxiety""

Why? never said implied threshold mattered not.

I simply pointed weakness argument, correct about. RemindMe! two weeks Let's forget susceptible people get pnemonia vaccine, works quite well--but covid. Working vulnerable people every day think honestly seen maybe 10 dangerous snakes 15 years I've here, used outdoors lot. Even give wide berth usually shuffle off. things can't see scarier IMO, like brain eating amoeba flesh eating bacteria. usually problem summer. know don’t go away, I’ve avoided frivolous activities. haven’t gone movies, dined restaurant, gone bar, etc, don’t plan starting vaccine daily new cases drop virtually none. 

There’s health avoiding exposure, end getting exposed work something else that’s necessary life wanted make sure health good shape I’d best chance fighting off. 

Still, situation seems practicing caution prudent move. Happy Next Spike Starts Day!

I saw many idiots yesterday. surge next two weeks we're still feeling effects Memorial Day.

No one wearing mask. 6 inches apart? Maybe. Look 7 day average. Day day nearly meaningless. many sources sampling artifacts.

Economy favors rich human lives hmmm hard choice. Well 2 + nothing = nothing really want world go back prohibition days? know, Mafia running amok, crime rates skyrocketting civil unrest increasing? even reducing drunk crimes much? yeah, punishment opening early. literally article cited original comment. think expecting second wave. precautions place, mitigate affects best can. determined airborne. longer question. Hence, masks 6 feet distancing. No. bulk people refusing done research, found 1/1000 death rate coronavirus said ""I'll take odds!""

Is stupid calculation personal opinion? Yes real world people every single day past 100 years+. Doesn’t help frats throwing parties get it? Back early April cases pretty high area, dad's partner work another co-worker close contact caught covid. dad rides car partner shares desk work. thought sure he'd test positive. quarantined two weeks got tested second week. tested negative! possible? True that! keep telling every low there's high man cannot wait high First sentence article, “After several months mixed messages coronavirus pandemic, White House settling new one: Learn live it.”

So that’s it. That’s new response.

Learn live it. Nice, right? 

I would suggested, “Just live it”. Nike-sounding flair. /s I’m hoping best fearing worst. Kanye west running lot millennial friends said damn I’ll vote Kanye in. I’m close giving up. Canadian CBP allow Americans enter country say driving Alaska? Seems like big plot hole whole effort making protect Canada.

Still waiting tests done see it’s gone, alone experience lucky surgeon able push through. also family TX works surgical oncologist working right now. true. Poor thing!!!  breath, homie. Also, wash mask frequently (if cloth). Michigan talking here? state or... rom Sunday Sunday, Florida reported 59,036 new cases, highest amounts one-week period since pandemic began. 312 deaths also reported 318,851 tests administered, latter breaking another record comparison, week ending June 28 saw 43,784 cases, 258 deaths 282,000 tests administered. previous week ending June 21 saw 21,723 cases, 230 deaths 190,000 tests administered. think anyone ignoring it. ok.

Dumbass selfish douchebags. zoomer brother. Generation Z, ages 5-25 years old, last alphabet 🤔 figure out.

You've probably already noticed sub skews older particularly risk. people sheep, they're scared, trying what's best others, world full conflicting information.

Yes, sub biased clearly mods specific agenda. mean name calling insults acceptable. fact, that's never acceptable efficacious way making point.

Once again, please stop. wouldn’t take city mayors word gospel. sounded like they’ve wanted awhile get ok Abbott.

Mortality rate going down, throw number window hospitals overwhelmed. Also, 0.3% mortality, even 140,000,000 Americans get infected, that’s 400,000+ Americans dead posts seem denying virus.

Seeing videos coming China. gf theory lot people's stimulus check bought fireworks.  going around us days irony anyone strong respiratory ailment couldn’t breath mask would high risk group covid-19 death.

But simple. mask, wear face shield. also helpful. really don’t clue actual DOJ logo looks like you? ;) Expert pro-China propagandists mean. Chinese people arguably economic freedom Americans, totalitarian. China clearly governs overall benefit people. Looks like pretty wrong timing things. wave following different trajectory before.

Average deaths increased significantly Arizona, Texas smaller extent Florida (obviously offset places done nationally up). seems almost certain week higher death count last week, last week may higher prior holiday weekend.

Are deaths spiking? moment, looks like may begin slower crawl week. graph supposed back story up? Yes, thoughts exactly hes vent since march. like damn let go already. Horrible say position say damn wasnt good all. keep chopping cling little hope. personally wouldnt want loved ones keep getting procedures knowing little hope bringing home. You. Are. Not.

Australia, whilst much virus circulating community different situation, grappling school attendance discussion throughout pandemic. school year starts around 1 Feb finishes December, summer break help make decision us.

All schools transitioned virtual learning mid-March school holidays early April. holidays due finish late April (Easter), students started returning school 3-4 week period certain year groups returning specific days (Year 1 &amp; 3 Monday, Years 2&amp;5 Tuesdays final year students returning every day) help physical distancing. went well, one record child child transmission Australian school [happy corrected!].

It currently 2 week winter school holidays states &amp; territories school students returning normal next week, except perhaps one state, Victoria, experiencing significant transmissions. 

[Victorians, nothing announced, suspicions various discussions r/CoronavirusDownunder ] It’s could blame 9/11 someone else, even brownish skin. 
 
The virus continues spread badly US due failures people country. that’s hard many face. keep ignoring keep spreading making failures worse harder confront. get one dude. nooooo really? almost like people warned live SD rally Mt. Rushmore. violent mobs? mean cops tear gassing shooting somewhat-lethal rubber bullets people tee shirts holding signs protesting state-sanctioned brutality? Yes, agree that! Yep there’s still data says contributed spikes This. Although heard cured demise. completely fair, based comments read echo chamber reddit, would expected US higher Germany France. numbers also May would assume they’ve increased countries. would loved even week home nightmare. Absolutely. don’t know true nature viral damage even asymptomatic carriers. Infectious disease practitioners work said this. Honestly considering wearing mine go might contageous fight stigma wesring masks here. Coming virus hoping people would take things like flu serious things played sounds like opposite now. flu kill quite bit every year, deal year colds flu wife pregnant baby, inexcusable people barely got flu go back work public. even vaccines every year usually pretty effective. excise flu season bad is. Yep, them. 

I blame anyone following science particular manner act cases. 

Its normal consider science behavioral imperative, like advice. Yeah science tells us bad health eat fatty foods smoke. excuse me, gonna BBQ shit bacon smoking good cigar. go almost everything. Science tells no, subjective value overrides advice. Instead teaching material 7 times day teach record one time. One 10th grade English teacher school district could English class play videos 10th grade high school students district. district 7 10th grade English teachers, frees 6 English teachers right there. 6 teachers grade assignments turned in. reassign teachers elsewhere. Maybe ask blood thinners take baby aspirin. know controversial.

What's special memorial Day weekend far remember lot ""reopen economy"" stuff pushed specifically would open memorial Day weekend. Impossible separate reopening holiday celebrations unless find specific spreader events enabled economic reopening. almost literally like dumb child would do. ""OMG WEAR SUN SCREEN BEACH, NAZIS!"". ""Latino African-American residents United States three times likely become infected white neighbors, according new data, provides detailed characteristics 640,000 infections detected nearly 1,000 U.S. counties,"" continues paper. ""And Black Latino people nearly twice likely die virus white people, data shows.""

The full article New York Times here:

[The Fullest Look Yet Racial Inequity sort article you’d expect read February Abbott always plan re-evaluate necessary actions

Or people call ""no plan all"". 20% people test positive need oxygen?? children wear warm glove winter? children want wear sun hat sun? post shit. posted 100s times two days ago.... That's well good except fact real data support claim.

How sure new cases continue increase? sure exceed surge capacity? sure increased hospitalizations correlate increased deaths?

I'm taking precautions speculating future based past events well millenial. welcome party :/ die COVID 19, died complications COVID 19. Something sound right. takes man 5 months die COVID 19 people die 2 weeks? think left things article. American, humbly say us dumbfounded *very* loud minority acting. It’s terrifyingly frustrating. Sadly, majority parents want kids back school. necessarily think safer, need return work. think respiratory failure is? People die breathing difficulties. young womam 20s lung transplant lungs damaged. Also asthma attacks cause heart attacks causes much strain heart, pnemonia also cause heart attacks strains heart breathing difficulties.  they're gone America stronger. agree, seen alot older asthmatics require intubation almost immediately hospital. Anecdotal, know, adjusted age, I'm sure u would see trend. Also, free meals qualify. noticed smell lacking since senior year im junior college poetic beauty this, considering people trying travel non essential reasons high likelihood ga people whole campaign based o. ""were going build wall, going make Mexico pay it.""

That seems far away now, would 100% brashly claim victory tiny border town set length chicken wire keep American plague vectors.  Karma!

Popular subs suffer people karma farming. lying said virus takes ages kill healthy people. brutal experience. know safe distance indoors, virus documented travel well 4.5 meters, excellent illustrations. Outdoors least air currents dispel particles. Yeah seen photos, lots people wear mask packed like sardines. Politicians going call mob lack ppe ave social distancing ave turned become violent.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* People disabilities selling services lol. respect hustle. Excellent. hope learn mistakes wearing freaking masks. may need locked second wave hit Pace probably worst salsa buy like lung damage pneumonia lungs try wall infected areas basically gives scar tissue inside lungs. GOT AIDS! would expect many family supporting jobs. really awful situation. someone said different post, virus takes elevator stairs down.  Oh, got it. Thought related COVID. hit diseases like cancer, case usually welfare benefit kicks in. Death toll 958+ Benghazis 1 scientist supports lab theory put it: virus came animals, seeing infectious is, would finding everywhere animals. 

Also, seems skipped stage adapting human human transmission. 

Maybe New Zealand looking sweet Yuans trade deal? largely related “youthful” population incorrect recording causes death. 
Only around 22% deaths 2019 medically certified, according experts. lost part sense smell 3 years ago Bit introvert generally happy life. live close mountains going outdoors big part leisure time. hated lockdown. Honestly, outdoor seating areas much safer. virus present bar/restaurant, *all over* everything place. transmitted staff spend day working building, sitting outside marginally removes risk. Yeah dunno, news seem great, yet see packed parks masks place still.  It’s complicated. Unfortunately humans many lands turned everything matter belief empowered people act it. 

When people say America developed country, really need wonder. Poor third world nations Asia much higher compliance wearing masks. culturally people believe saving society, individual. everyone tries considerate others. Western countries developed individualistic culture every individual important rights. 

Add pitfalls democracies state enforcement poor, tons people exercise “rights” wear mask. 

This people Asia, China Korea survive, America go trying hold dollars. 


Really sad. course helped spread. partisan asshole would try convince someone didnt. guess what? Human human! Good luck that... mean don’t count probables half state? father two, understand. anti maskers wear grocery bag face? Sounds good! lot old people, they’re tiny minority like people can’t medically wear mask. Well problem card say ""official"". Yes, requires adjust too. People ready lie wear mask accept need *call ahead* staff paid, crew, ship legally salvage. unpaid staff also maintain ship beyond need survival.

That either really dumb plan, cruse lines expect cruise business collapse medium term intend scuttle large parts fleet. Hi there, residant Toronto working tiny apartment 4 months, lining 6-feet apart masked neighbours hour get grocery store capping capacity 35. pretty evidant measures put place interest public health slowing spread Virus.  

Canada USA recorded first cases within days other.  One nation largely closed 4 months starting slowly re-open strict public health measures mandated masks areas.  One confidantly past peak first wave. 

The other, closed couple weeks. Gave up, went back status quo continuing record record numbers daily. 

Masks quarantine actually work. looking vastly different situations America Brazil reset world evidance such. didn’t apply correctly then. mess weeks, ran smoothly. 
 
In fact, still apply isn’t backlog. Funding happens quickly “But free county, wHatEver wanT!!” 

Sigh.  Play video games another language, stream hopefully income Yesterday went gas station really fast. front door masks required sign. Masks required statewide public closed space. tiny gas station occupancy limit 116 I've seen city grocery stores limit 30. half masks on, several mask covering nose went check lady stood right behind without mask enough space. I'm sick tired this. They're trying really hard spread they're kicking screaming like children ruining economy needed bare minimum could probably opened now, masks political now. agree political compromises don’t happen anymore America pandemic allowed become partisan honesty question you’re going require students come back campus vs online learning keep giant Petri dish campus life, difference make sit six feet apart outside classes?

Unless college changed since slept roommates. showered floor mates. friends talked, ate, studied, partied etc with. Libraries, labs, cafeterias, club meetings. There’s endless places virus transmission going happen. Let’s even pretend classes outside going make bit difference. People care enough others show protest support Black lives generally also care enough others wear mask (which can’t said right wing protesters...). And, racism major public health crisis far longer covid has. believe you. disappointed Swedish media. real pros buy toilet paper en bloc cut need: (interesting part starts 3:39) right, live bubble. travel south illinois work, would say business contacts open opposed lockdown. area stricter :) many us militaries Love it! Who's grossly mistreated US? What? PPP isn’t difficult get Compare situation US developed country numbers (and resulting freedoms enjoyed relative safety) speak themselves. leaders... Show video, assistant facilitate discussion every 10 15 minutes. Video pauses discussion. works. going crowded places pubs stop threat hot zones spreading virus. Pretty self explanatory really. someone recovers goes back playing sports notices decreased lung capacity I'm sure fine. permanently damage people recover. study showing real long term damage, 6 months post recovery, post it. stop fear mongering based speculation. already scary disease without speculation fake news attached it. bad saying is, fair, might *only* get really sick go bankrupt literally die? point? even point making case anything keeping bar closed letting stay unemployment? would say predictions made using models. models constantly updated using recently collected data.

I agree cases death increasing recently (obviously). question trend continue severe get? Alarm bells raised two weeks ago alarm bells heard. rushing judgment texans responded appropriately yet. say jury's still that. 10.6% unacceptably high also number currently managing. Who's say wont improve near future based actions taken gov/ response citizens? Right 240 doctors 30 countries sharing evidence linger air much smaller droplets. urging change guidance. meme? people actually thick. Reminder 0.05% 5/1000. That’s fuck load people. entire population USA age group 17.5M people would die coronavirus. Think speak. U.S protestant work ethic, people feel guilty work.

Not much thing elsewhere. It’s I’d politics. I’ve seen many social media post doctors nurses claiming covid19 hoax masks don’t work unless filters air etc etc. 

Even one doctor block grew talking size mask don’t block things small. pointed piggy backs water droplets mask block water droplets blocks covid19. went end said I’m blocking you. 

Mind discussion comment thread mutual friends wall shared original post. also note posted links verifying claims. 

Pro tip: don’t make doctor look bad facts backed science. 

One last thing, doctor works hospital according messages got laid doesn’t directly work covid19 patients. Amazing doctor let economics interfere science. podcast link immune compromised could considered disability current environment wearing masks physical distancing would reasonable accommodations provide fair equal access all. That’s lethality. problem schools remain open. virus going go around school system like wildfire force closures.

Because America didn’t deal properly virus put no-win situation comes schools. school systems starting half assed security theatre fail keep anyone safe. that’s we’ve told move learn live virus... Getting mean Twitter comments much ""punishment"". Dude needs involuntarily quarantined. Yeah get half size class thing. can't see effective all, especially young kids. snowballs chance hell dude. It’s nice thought though. Catherine Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist University Texas Health Science Center Houston, studies Covid-19. When, wearing mask standing edge great swell people, attended recent protest Houston supporting Mr. Floyd, sense contradiction tugged “I certainly condemned anti-lockdown protests time, I’m condemning protests now, struggle that,” said. “I hard time articulating Health officials Houston Los Angeles suggested demonstrations led increased infections, provided data. New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio instructed contact tracers ask infected people attended 10 epidemiologists interviewed article said near-daily marches rallies nearly certain result transmission. Police use tear gas pepper spray, crowding protesters police vans buses, puts people “In likelihood, infections occurred protests; question much,” said Professor Lurie. “No major new evidence emerged suggests protests superspreader virus hit Black Latino Americans particular ferocity, hospitalizing populations four times rate white Americans. Many face underlying health issues, likely Americans live densely populated housing work front lines epidemic. result, Latinos Black people dying rates well excess white Americans. Thanks, know that. Yes great time people social anxiety relax actually try things never able many activities online remote. Could diet/inflammation maybe blood sugar, things...as virus limits oxygen flow throughout body.  people, perhaps inflammation, might get bad outcomes, complications like dominos...could fatal. So...diet ?  Maybe ?  whatever causes inflammation leaves prone others. (Which could genes too.). think real question is.. know this. permanently quarantine third? Yup people know typical symptoms like loss smell, fever, cough getting tested self quarantining home.  still entitled REASONABLE adjustments make sure access goods services. Calling ahead asking groceries handed you, getting assistance load back car expectation. Probably points like enlighten you. matter white gay? facts entirely irrelevant here. Possible. rules stipulate going back forth shits giggles. Pick side stay. time travelling. detailed, recent information including changes usage time. compare US lots countries. Wtf, even possible much motivation disciplined. level 9000 awesome. Exactly this. Plus mine super cute lol Someone done TV reality show lives. SURVIVOR: Abandoned Cruise. 

Can't worse Tiger King! Hi- someone smarter ELI5 anything applies individuals whose disability makes wearing mask impossible/hard moment (but due health reasons, physical/intellectual limitations)? 

Obviously curbside, jazz- work trying educate case question comes up. Yes, normally good patient care avoid ulcers critically ill patients sometimes poor circulation almost unavailable. patients ICU covid work longer month developed stage 3-4 pressure ulcers, despite turning providing good nursing care. Another problem proning patients, developed facial ear pressure ulcers due positioning despite best efforts. sixteen year old boy district died April. change damn thing schools re-opening. IMO already months. Virus rewards woke cause? people willing look calendar artifact ""good news"".

It national holiday weekend. course *the reported* numbers down. Low deaths good. Younger population. Unfortunately Bangladesh one highest population densities world. need test want get ahead this. Otherwise see numbers long time. 

Extremely unfortunate time get this, superbly well economically even growth rate outperforming neighbor, India. sooner control virus, sooner start economic recovery. probably understand pay bribe I'm white. simply turn back fellow citizens get grossly mistreated. called ""human."" 

Yes, good luck indeed. Haha! got’em, boys! google long term effects. Lots it. Also group called long haulers. Although right small people dealt Coronavirus continuously 100 days age 35. seem worse. Apparent stimulates immune system even virus leaves ..your body still thinks fighting disease. didn’t ask intent.

My intent counter disparaging groups people suffering outbreaks.

In state, almost half cases come certain small ethnic minority. don’t want say state know lot people want make connection outbreak rates stupidity. 

My point reason US worse outbreak countries isn’t fault people, rather structural problems society. Remember anyone drowns they're witches! Interesting, thanks. Yeah, got. Welcome Thunderdome. ban UN. laughing stocks world now. wife would look another job immediately. even considering teaching immunocomprimised? job achools go virtual? think Art stay curriculum? was, European sitting official place Europe without cases since start, hoping least 1 50 States gotten shit together. 7 day reporting delay + 18.5 day delay symptoms deaths.

Irans second wave deaths came 1 month wave new cases. Wear damn masks!! I’ll help science. Air conditioning removes humidity air. That’s air conditioners usually water dripping them. hot outside people uncomfortable go inside air conditioning. United States biggest user air conditioning world. lot people inside space low humidity created air conditioning one effective transmission vectors. hot States reached peak temperature people inside low humidity rather outside. scientific study COVID called “Chinese Restaurant Study” explains effect. Get it? takes effort someone try use legislation fake cards wear mask public, instead putting mask on. Worse, they're going countries cause problems.

[News footage Several Americans (presumably USFK soldiers) decided celebrate 4th July SOUTH KOREA setting fireworks middle busy street harassing local police officers. Nobody even wearing mask.

Who knows many people infected drunken stupidity? countries allowing American tourists. Getting vaccine guarantee get Covid-19. might help, who's going risk getting vaccinated without testing? takes years test vaccines thoroughly. thanks. I'll take chances virus 99%+ people recover issues. untested vaccine kill you. rash skin, discolouration fingers toes....difficulty breathing shortness breath chest pain...loss speech movement

These related changes blood clots. “Covid toes” example: rashes typically associated irritation immune reactions, also display due changes blood - micro clots example cause tiny red purple spots (petechiae), purplish bruising look like rash (purpura). Pain chest also sign clot thrown lung, loss speech movement stroke...which course caused clot. understand Canadian news covered likely wonderful states, however Canada, especially major cities still regular large protests.   100% right, wrong share feel excited good news. borning, stay home life tough lot people nice see tangible result meaning something.

I've read articles lives saved three month horizon meaningless wetter place six months later. plan we'll spend 6 months minimum maybe years wearing masks rest?  delaying inevitable prolonging damage?

JK whores. weighs duck.... Somehow nba going testing people twice day yet can’t test asymptomatic people?  Yeah shit. live HK I'm tired reading comments articles say put masks went life normal. We've varying levels restrictions since January. Borders closed, quarantine arrival; schools, govt offices, bars, gyms, salons, public venues, etc closed months many working home. centre health protection plans protocols place start followed them. Masks might help fucking magic amulet disease. part too. started exercising home vigorously though. explain doctors catching corona bub I’m American you’re worth arguing with. You’re idiot mix dengue. Brazil currently dengue outbreak sets new records. probably linked. students see tuition bills loan statements blow up, they’re going lot demanding get investment.

Lockdown ended ago here. effect allowed go exercise within 1 km home, 1h most. Europe took lockdowns quite seriously. sucked least got thing control enjoy life again, now. San Diego checking in. reports 7/4 lumped one report 7/5. 1000+ cases headline, mentions one line numbers 2 days. That's good bad single day increase. Yeah, too.

I even catch that. probably incorrect since overall risk 0.4% according cdc Username checks out. Cool argument that. public health safety. Remote learning make it. pile big enough build stupid wall. Whats current status immunity Stockholm far? remember 7% start May think 20% last month? yea, they're reporting, actual immunity levels probably much lower... Tim Honks defender logged I'm sure anything. I'm guy. I've read:

Most coronaviruses produce least short-term immunity. SARS immunity remained high 4-5 months declining next 2-3 years. human reinfections COVID-19 documented time. Rhesus macaques could infected 28 days first “clean up?” old article - found strange China posting ""It's Airborne"" cartoons early May, never knowledge released official statement shared determination WHO.

Two months later scientists petitioning announce virus airborne....just bizarre series events. so.. pop help defend discovery led development marketing trade name Viagra, works enhancing action NO

&amp;#x200B;

but **still can't go store** for.... least 4 hours. Obligatory reminder start celebrating taking masks off. 

Keep social distancing wearing masks public spaces. I’m sitting dentist son right sweating dutifully inside mask link still doesnt say ""fair share"" is.

And information discussed numbers use prove increased taxation would cover nearly 1T+ bill/year MFA. quick math that, best, finds $200B I. right though, should. USA looked worse nazi Germany. definitely higher kill count factor genocide, slavery, 9/11 well middle eastern nations decimated profit control oil. Meanwhile US going full steam ahead opening schools fall. Yeah open one box, one solar powered satellite phone it. really close all. I'm continuing powerlifting program without significant investment weights.

I suppose powerlifting, no, everyone else it'll fine. Years ago bought used power rack, adjustable bench, 390 pounds+barbell (the latter Dick's Sporting Goods). can't remember total price remember paid within year versus gym fees. 390 pounds much deadlift I'll admit, much major lift powerlifting, limit deadlift weight anyway. game-changed fitness wintery Minnesota, walk downstairs instead driving cold car. realized skipping many gym days effort get there. Obviously need space this, crazy. moved stuff takes space 7 feet wide (+ barbell loading room) 5 feet deep. US: dibs! going here. None reopening phases triggered surge yet. equating whole country region different story happening others. 

No reopening phase happens previous one increases numbers. That's actually built process here. last reopening phase happen pre-vaccine. final solution! flu plus pneumonia plus car crashes kill 100k per year normally. year combined kill nearly 250k far, why? I’m asking missed point comment. probably got stuck there. Snowbird season ended april/may ""lockdown"" began. canadian would choose stay hellswamp summer. Also reasonable accommodation curb side service, online shopping, virtual shoppers, various permutation go store. 

I almost 100% sure ADA would side maskless morons. Norway's measures due Sweden's high burden infection. choose ignore measures problem, esp. Finnish government late issuing stern repeated warnings Finns stay Sweden due dangerous is. numbers juiced explain significant increase cause deaths March-June previous years? large number excess deaths aren’t explained reported COVID deaths, real number almost certainly undercounted. Well hopefully she’s immune immunity last long enough foolish wants infect anyone else. There’s still much don’t know. oh yeah, vaccine half americans violently gonna protest against. month Probably get married all. government need know relationships also stole dead guy's shoes I'll ask again, see argument made without actual suggestion better time beyond ""before did"". specific date why? I'm also sure know ""declare"" pandemics anymore. highest level alert PHEIC, declared Jan 30. 

The recommendations change Jan 30 March 11th. follow question exactly think national governments would reacted differently use word guidance change Jan 30 March 11th? Same. far rich. work manual labor job. happen know budget money live means. problems making mortgage payment paying bills unemployment. millennial sister bar tender Dallas, exposed Covid 3 times 7 weeks telling vaccine going kill us couple months. 

I reminded needs stop basing opinion theory's hears online wait science available make decision. Theory's that. Science lie incredibly tragic much unnecessary suffering going happen. rate, herd immunity seem far away I’m saying idea talking 😷 increased herd immunity level - reason facts... difficulty don’t know when(/if) vaccine coming. working unprecedented speed promising early results. knew vaccine coming 3 months, 18 months, 3 years would able make better decisions balance risk necessity, don’t know. nheld hostage ship getting paid. guarantee repairs would cost ten times supposed paid minimum. Right. separated reason. KNOWS this, chooses longer hold true. ... imagine believing companies care first company capitalize vaccine order reap financial rewards 🤣 must say, love working home. Asperger's ADHD, get lot work done able stim otherwise manage focus without worrying looking ""normal"". careful significant figures. 0.0001% 1 million. There's 300 million Americans, give take. really want argue every single American caught covid 19 300 deaths? God emperor United States. 

It’s dumb meme folks share president crave taste boot. That’s cool. appreciate trust God angle it’s minimized still there. Basically don’t trust god keep safe stupid decisions, “take care god take care too.” Basically good way help lower panic anxiety everyone must feeling load crap. virus whatever want to, serve whatever political agenda want. 

The virus different strains lethality? coincidental. Yet see strain sequence breakdown, death rate predicted back April 0.26% 3% like thought..

Young children suddenly big transmitters schools reopening? strange coincidence. 

Covid struggles spread outside meaning protest thousands go beach? Im asking obviously you’ll happy home discord day didnt leave house party shit started. faring better lockdown countries same. keep trying tell people that. Also, people quick blame China Coronavirus Spanish Flu originated United States. virus stopped United States confirmed cases. Meanwhile, cases spiking low flat. I'm glad fewer deaths (though I'm sure reporting...), looks lot like they've gotten control haven't. rented room 70 year old dude would fox news going 3 TVs house. worst part slight delay them. seriously felt like brainwashing camp Wooly Mommoth still alive Exactly. always race time. question slow COVID enough hospitals prepare scientist learn virus find treatments vaccine.  still race things like physical distancing masks slows transmission buys us time. Get antibody test rub face. upset going deaths don’t massive spiking? everyone sub really want people die don’t you? Yeah that's pretty unbelievable. among countries similar size demography do....among countries near top, discounting small countries, even closer top We're working it, long even children still call kids ""Lapjärvel"" going long way True part human nature war men action needed 

We fought lot poorly thought wars done pretty awesome raids  Absolutely not. Naw, far European half WW2 goes least, I'd say safest protraying Allies good guys Axis bad guys major war last several centuries. bad guys friggin Nazis, know...

However, typical USA portrayal America swooping war winning single-handedly, mere helpful assist Allies happened there, definitely silly. Kinda looks like Rick Grimes picture. believe hoax, even come here? Father 1 year old here. I'm sure situation wfh. are, one thing hope/optimism give amount time child this. Never lives get opportunity spend much time bond now. say bad days positives. Best luck family congratulations good. weird wasnt aware before. covid news OP always shocking, simply bc aware flu ""undangerous"".

dont understand downvote though days remind much I’ve lost (10 since covid, 10 before) remember whole lifestyle change isn’t going ruined cheat day- even week crappy eating. Don’t beat it- enjoy feeling lighter feet everything you’ve done far  BTW, add qualifier non-Canadians know see yuge is. Thank you! ever ask relevant questions nah I’m Canadian. 

And I’m glad sports right now. Lets people focus punching Nazis. wonder numbers going up...you wanna argue semantics ignore big picture.

Truly insane allow Indians travel right now. Covid daily deaths reached lowest point since March.

You would think news would report That’s went herd immunity since poor weak culled... what's abbreviation stand for? LOL, deserve mocked. want see May July update this. could even include Mexico stepping saying, ""America failing, time close boarders""

Oh mighty fallen. many different subs going post weak argument lol

You've posted like 20 times, stupid realize proves nothing like people come local museum small poodles strollers claiming service dogs. I'd like think scale countries dealing this. others. us Darwinist survival fittest moment. Tech graduate here. gotta say I'm disappointed, surprised. Tech always treated students staff like garbage. cringeworthy call someone tool using words like ""pro tip"" focussing tone message, I'll add shallow. That’s airborne means. virus present sufficiently small droplets droplets remain air long periods time, remain infectious periods person passing airspace future time inhaling droplets become infected. I'm letting stupid virus stop going beach brink r/collapse, mean? reckoning long time coming feel like many us could see mile away. hoped I’d never live it. really hope improves soon frustrating stuck kind level long! sorry deal kind racism. Definitely earlier March 16, months Covid19 ravaged Hubei, Wuhan, SK, Singapore.

A pandemic declared fits criteria clearly defined. 

They declared H1NI pandemic weeks first case reported. 

It took months declare Covid 19 pandemic think overestimated H1N1.

Their failure declare covid19 pandemic earlier resulted numbers now.

They responded Covid 19 way reacted H1N1. 

Risking lives billions people would accused overestimating virus outbreak strange position take organisation that's supposed representing World Health. 

H1N1 Sweden dead Covid per capita US does. *That’s expensive add-on.* know maybe FATHER. racist meme got stop. married, husband raising kids. student teaching spring I’m looking jobs now.

Here’s someone addressing vaccine then? Yea dude. switch distance learning possible. Brightest year? know, pain virus caused world weighs me. enjoyed lock down, making best good situation.  Search Toronto’s mobility data here, compare curves USA.

The actual mobility data shows Toronto’s curve looks similar US’ average terms depth duration.

It true Arizona’s particular 10 percent less deep didn’t last long Toronto’s, national average similar One thing like Hanks way way stories portrays fighters heroic. Almost like war ""good thing."" Especially obsession ww2. many movies involved portray us good guys ww2?

We victor war, real stories way complicated black white: we're good guys bad guys. donned masks second suspected March. WELL Canada took seriously. 

We think everyone order get this. work team, united front kick damn bug's ass. There's HUGELY Canadian saying old ad, puck stops here. That's family opted treat situation.

its lockdown. can't lockdown forever, time buy lockdown used beef testing capacity, boost hospital capacity, get contact tracing place advise local businesses conduct business safer manner. also medical research vaccines treatments

the US fucked up, including lockdown. can't get right, fuckin embarrassing ironically I'm sure skating rink brings tenth bar town (in sales/liquor taxes). People illogical this. r/rollerderby skater saying team considering resuming practices. THREE people team covid-19. full contact sport. spend lot time mashing shoulders hips people putting sweaty, panting faces 18 inches less apart. league single skater case one skater know family it, we're still coming back anytime soon. Meanwhile, another league city sent survey parents junior league asking parents felt comfortable sending kids practice. hike appalacian spends lot time fantasizing world would look like slam-dunked problem, imagines speeches he'd give, praise he'd receive. 

Then next day says speeches fantasized head, followers cheer shower adulations 'saving' them. 

And fast track major re-outbreak, Florida's hospitals peak, Texas next week, one implementing nation-level rational plan anything. 

The thing administration done artificially bottleneck PPE make ton money cronies. 

In sane world would jail. 

This sane world anymore. i'm helping them, think literally themselves, listen experts opened they're economy fully. complaining pork that? Sad reality all. 

It's also colleges + schools continuing say they'll reopen things on-campus in-class. people drop take gap years receive money saying quickly, ""because COVID, we're moving entirely online"". Hell, universities like BU UNC said, can't afford lockdown Fall semester. people used work tweeted Pretty sure Germany structured similarly past, states lot autonomy. That's also times looks like even Merkel keep track allowed state right now.

BUT what's certainly different divide country politicians. remember correctly lot major decisions (like mask requirements) made meeting every Governor chancellor present. Though requirement that's Germans decided things. (Though states like Bavaria sometimes step front, border Austria). i'm looking math assistance. 

has anyone calculated long takes hospitals filled? know every city different number beds different population (including nearby areas feed hospital system) seems like calculable.

x cases per million amount time z icu beds = overflow certain number days later. 

anyone recall reading articles math yourself? person classes 3 weeks highly irresponsible. hope come senses soon. American made laugh would, live US. I’m allowed Europe right now. YES!!! Scroll up. got flamed accused child abuse family managed enjoy situation. Apparently we’re supposed depressed angry? would try happy kids time? supposed apologize succeeded making crappy scary situation enjoyable home? idiots EU, clean soon find them. mean yeah, use parenthesis? Yup, it’s long enough haven’t new cases weeks certified “COVID-free”. 
Hell, one disembarked Florida half crew positive wouldn’t make big impact Florida’s infection rate! lost 15-20 lbs lockdown... mostly new human brought world. gained weight though! 4 lbs far! has. Sweden conditions intimately correlated ethnicity first thing check correlation black Latinos confounder factors explain situation. I’m trying argue... honestly heck do? vaccine it’s going keep going X amount people non-carriers virus lacks ability affect new hosts. I’m arguing masks hand washing btw, keeping kids school obliterating chance us work provide families going break society way we’ve never seen. America really screwed pooch one I'm introvert would love it, except fact I'm single. You’d fine served dog something then? Needless say, we’re happy campers Melbourne Yes, poor children loving supportive family units. I'd say gullibility average uneducated citizen refutes pretty soundly. Degrees almost important ever, need require critical thinking logic out. woke hurt want go back bed. Won’t covid mutate? Climate change never went away. We've made beds lay it. financially better spending. would happily left patients fend stayed home. stressful lonely. One key functions report data. Question: measure newer observations antibodies last 3-4 months tops, second half relying T-cell reaction? make sense Fingers crossed goes vacation times year? havent vacation 5 years... “We’ll vaccine long end year” coming reality star turned politician bullshit spin. 

“I can’t predict vaccine” honest statement, matter says it. textbook concern trolling worth response point out. doubt victims domestic abuse break-ins, type violence enjoying it. used web MD, least reputable medical site existed. It’s bad actor Isaac Kappy started naming people like Hanks ended dead soon after. 

Also weird coincidence Hanks put ‘missing clothes’ post Highway 66 (location Kappy’s death) soon gotta tell you, I've never seen denial like this. best denial. World leaders keep asking maintain denial. real great American denial apologize stereotypical towards you.

Not sure auto mod removed comment. said appreciate worry. Oh, forgot mention printed tithing envelope. Haha playin, that’s cool though. main thing gotten upset, whole Covid-19. one talks exercising nutrition. would great time (maybe) inform people getting sun stretching legs!

Also mother 1 lung COPD, use oxygen, able wear mask well. I’m curious post isn’t allowed here? subreddit blatantly pro-China I’m start get real suspicious mods motives. search last week China related articles almost entirely China good job someone thinks virus came somewhere else China (what CCP trying since beginning). 

Does anyone else see this?! incoming (maybe) international student, scared way pretending everything normal. Either way, though, still get flat $600 week federal.

States' rights states' responsibilities apparently. would elect use rubber bands instead. pretty much implying people 65 dont deserve live. fucking piece shit.

Biden running score California NY, though. He's moved needle pretty evenly across country, including swing states. He's going win popular vote huge margin lose EC, that's vote distribution looks like right now. 

It's possible Trump still win, economy comes booming back example C19 dies down. he'll come back popular vote well. could see moderate popular vote/EC split like 2016, we're going see extreme version. Well hell... spent time reading today...is much excitement around this? who's taking anti lockdown people seriously? gives fuck us think? second stop wearing masks, R increases back normal herd immunity anymore. governor already said take them. going end getting flow Arizona Texas. he's good cyber. zoo midwest city open month indoor portions closed, limited capacity. gone times now. things would touch (infoboxes such) taped basically walking around park animals look at. come within 15 feet strangers everyone good giving space looking different animals. super refreshing ""go out"" something first time months.

I’m wondering purposely took preK kinder school last year travel, 7 months stopped traveling(which crazy fun!) homeschool WORST tried sorts different homeschool/roadschooling/unschooling systems.

But sister homeschooled zero issues kids chose go regular school.

Homeschooling probably work already feel great home time, doesn’t work every kid. daughter fine, son suffered it. Luckily caught regular school daughter year ahead according preschool teacher. Wait, what's suggestion here? far, there's increase cases, means protests spread virus much people thought. protesters go get tested infection rates go up, say protesters increased infections.


Currently number people getting sick rising. protesters got sick, got home got people sick, would see increase infected people hospitals. see that, yet. month since really big protests happening. Ah haha haha. Let hoarding begin [""If get corona, get corona, let stop Understated comment.  There's reason negative karma, know. ... analogy I’ve used cigarette smoke vape clouds.

Honestly, tell Christians, America makes special god? see all. Gotta wait till Nov. 5th  Same, kid daycare, wife assisted living facility. I’d rather take vaccine that’s tested clinical trials heavily researched virus itself. Ok enough enough, I'm going live north pole. first coronavirus... mention yank handshake  maybe help keep people inside Covid, still get vaccine? FYI, people Fire Island arent typically people support listen Trump begin with.  mental health. clearly showing symptoms paranoia Makes sense bro one question, cold, cover mouth hand cough? so, why? Well, February. yeah easy get antibody test well. drive testing center went every appointment. Personally feel like working hard helping enrich wealthy elites, maybe helps live country functional tax system.

Just curiosity done lately better society get ahead yourself? Remote company policy changes tracked website: seems many companies gone fully remote due pandemic! remote shift happening! primary establishment electoral college ever designed care slavery. also improve gesticulations? worst thing world hearing speak. second worst thing horrendous hand gestures. Drive insane. Can't bear like 10 seconds watching him.  assumed re-opening Disney World would canceled pushed back light dramatic surge cases Florida, actually looks like maniacs plan opening. can't see theme park like Disney reopen safely. Totally agree dude wish Canadian. Fuck country electing idiot. man killed grandfather 19 Covids.  200k deaths end next week? Unlikely. Deaths going up, seven day average, 0.41 percent day. 

We see 200k deaths long long time rate unlikely change dramatically within week. I’ll never understand hate internet. would rather leading us right now? Scheer? Like may best prime minister. it’s pretty clear what’s happening brother south, dad messy divorce cousin pacific could much worse leadership time like this. He’s best he’s pretty okay. looking this. wonder financial impact be, even though sad disappointing issue handled poorly. They're waiting services needed people ordered confiscate equipment supplies.

You think benefit public, you? also steel / alum business, started right tariffs, worked electronics China tariffs fucked us over. 

Man customers hurting company crazy prices. Prices changed literally daily, caused many headaches larger workload guess. hiring freeze also brought stupid. 

Yeah, industrial people hate US now. buy MUCH possible Canadian mills QC &amp; ON. 

I also recently got burned truckload Texas due Covid delays STILL happening US, us Canada lead times trucking essentially bounced back. Since black face shouldnt banned america like everything else? Everything expensive. There’s perfect solutions here. got good ideas? share Monopoly niceness Australia reason neither cloth, medical masks filters small enough viruses.

The thing is, virus always inside little droplet, never air itself. droplets rather small, still larger virus particle therefore likely get stuck mask.

Also, cloth mask supposed reduce amout virus spread exhaling reach. seen different reports videos, that. Since game probabilities, every percent counts. It’s crazy people point New York needing extra capacity direct result lockdowns. Man I've seeing many posts beforehand people enjoy lockdown current moment. nice see even many people hear still positive experience lockdown rn. return work last month hand definitely enjoying lockdown got basically whatever wanted home. could I'd settle months lockdown lol. 1/3 people must kids job. Yeah really. News me. 


It's also kind hilarious: time complain I'm specific time ALSO complain never sleep. can't even consistent baseless attacks. outside physical distancing fine. Pardon ignorance and/or dumb question, would end safe/good take this, ineffective better one comes along months later, take one? known unknown? I'm going college freshman, whole predicament sucks. Like want finish college ASAP, dont want pay like $20k year zoom university. Smart man. always rather dad laborer.

Edit: also hate people!  Taking Scotland England example, England 4 times population density Scotland London saw many English deaths lot better New York did.
I know fashionable nowadays scapegoat England everything accounting population density excluding London one worlds cosmopolitan cities, 4 nations UK pretty much equal other. force make masks lol

Giving access patients good idea due liability reasons. would head state want meet Trump stand prop attempt legitimise whatever unhinged rant deigns inflict upon society day? Blonde, crazy? in, congratulations! list borrowers published Treasury Department. mention right would use ammo make look weak mask brave Trump I've gotten much done. find life much simple like this. pressure go things, stuff. all. comment low effort tbh.  truly insane see long people waiting test insane heat. [whole report itself]( 
 quite interesting worth least skim, especially middle ground worst case scenarios. thing caught eye this: summer, becomes clear covid-19 carries risk prolonged neurological symptoms, especially people age 30. many, rehabilitation leads marginal improvement, number long-term sick leave increases. causes concern many infected. time, number sick leave due fatigue symptoms also increasing, least among healthcare professionals. generally rising physical mental ill-health society strain healthcare economy.

This first indication I’ve seen Swedish authorities considered possibility herd immunity strategy may lead herd disability. think good least acknowledge *possibility* report. growing realization *may* happen substantial degree perhaps one factor behind least saying want towards Test, Trace, Isolate strategy taking tentative baby steps direction. 

Another thing thought interesting changed Sweden image pandemic leads lasting change world view Sweden. high death rates, combined perceived negative unique choice dealing crisis first months, etched itself. Sweden, previously regarded safe country, country built reason, seen instead risk-taking country country high risk infected. cases, also paired envy Sweden's never shutting society, therefore economic psychosocial social effects countries suffered from. immediate effect changed image unwillingness travel Sweden, even countries lifted travel restrictions. foreign tourist streams existed spring early summer, people applied ""open"" Sweden sin. late summer autumn 2020, foreign tourists visit Sweden. Another effect continued travel restrictions Swedes many countries Sweden extensive economic relations, makes difficult cooperate them. Planned exchanges, example research sports, also canceled. longer term, Sweden seems way becoming less attractive partner corporate research collaboration. desire invest Sweden declining, case ""brand Sweden"" also means Swedish export products losing competitiveness.

Rest World Squidward, closet full uno reverse cards... Archive link: premature assume pandemic Sweden waning. contrary, continue explosive development infection. worst case, may also outbreak mutated virus, according report produced guidance MSB.

“There risk lower guard beginning summer curves seem pointing right direction. need prepare next phase pandemic able handle several simultaneous events ”. emphasized Dan Eliasson, Director General Swedish Agency Social Protection Preparedness (MSB) new report.

Therefore, early summer, MSB, together authorities, worked scenarios pandemic could develop March 2021. 

[The scenarios presented report forecasts, show different conceivable trends next nine months.]( purpose authorities actors better prepared. Three different scenarios pandemic presented, followed “shocks” make situation even worse.

#The three scenarios pandemic are:

• **The hopeful.** spread infection world gradually diminishes feeling worst over. regions Sweden, however, infection increasing.
In spring 2021, spread infection Sweden low, restrictions lifted, healthcare economy slowly start function pandemic.

• **The nagging.** prolonged spread infection continues burden outside world Sweden. still severe economic consequences feeling endless crisis among populations. 

In Sweden, situation health care care elderly becoming increasingly strained tired staff, Swedes tired restrictions, increases spread infection. 

In spring 2021, spread infection continues globally effective vaccine yet. political divide EU increasing even commodity shortages threatening. 

In Sweden, health care severely strained elder care knees, unemployment increasing, evictions bankruptcies, housing prices falling. Sweden still cushion crisis fiscal measures, less political agreement. municipalities warn may forced cut operations.

• **The explosive.** initial decline global spread infection, explosive outbreaks occur parts world. sense confidence existed many places replaced strong distrust. Several countries moving authoritarian direction, restricting trade, damaging world economy even more. 

Political, economic social tensions rising - least US pandemic coincides presidential election. EU crippled internal deadlocks. 

In autumn, Sweden affected several major outbreaks infection. Health care lower endurance forced hard priorities [triage], care queues growing. Restrictions reintroduced schools open Christmas holidays. population divided tired restrictions require mandatory face masks. 

The Swedish economy hit hard shortage certain foods drives prices.
In spring 2021, spread infection Sweden low, severe regional outbreaks. public exhausted pandemic pushes away long-term political issues.
The economic crisis deepens increasing number notices time layoffs cannot return work. Inequality society increasing, leading dissatisfaction polarization. 

Highly indebted households forced sell homes number evictions increasing, bankruptcies. Swedish economy position reminiscent 1990s crisis.

**In addition scenarios** , MSB also warns shocks. One mutated virus spreads rapidly. Sweden, 40 percent workforce lost work sick caring sick family members. 

Another shock security political crisis pandemic gives rise social unrest violence extremist groups right left. Terrorist acts carried war breaks near EU ""when state attacked neighboring country"" situation becomes increasingly unstable.

#Several authorities behind scenarios 

The report ""Scenarios strengthen existing analysis planning corona pandemic, version June 2020"" available MSB's website.

The scenarios prepared MSB together Total Defense Research Institute (FOI) support National Board Health, Public Health Authority Riksbank. 20 authorities stakeholders submitted comments. 

FOI extensive experience developing scenarios. used increase mental readiness exercises games later lead military civilian preparation. may longer usual reporting delays people taking vacation now. Yeah saw even including group probables it’s 1,000 deaths official totals right world?You honestly sound delusional. Agreed called specific exceptions. also think casinos super high risk. love post, shows socialism UBI don’t work all. (mostly) take serious. FYI...most state borders closed since March border NSW Victoria notable holdout finally closing. Thank God survived. mean, first off, he's Tom Hanks! love guy! also, amount ""Tom Hanks never Covid-19, executed pedophile,"" conspiracy theories would start get nerves. symptoms loss smell taste. actually terrible, food thing look forward isolation felt like nothing. senses came back week I'm still testing positive even though smell taste past 10 days. dual citizenship, much right Canada you. Maybe want switch plates one reason another. Maybe rental. Maybe they're planning moving back covid dies America. Everyone seems think magical two week number drop dead

Its two weeks incubation, averaging around 5-10 days exposure 

Thats sickness phase starts; things like hospitalizations start, sadly deaths typically follow that

What happened Italy, New York, Spain...they ran capacity hospitals thats things turned ugly....Texas Florida starting run capacity... Hey, r/SpringfieldMO 50% morons, thank much... Still acting like voters picked Biden. sending kid school september wife might quit teaching job force classroom quotation marks around *crisis*? entire thread proof sub shouldn’t taken seriously. bunch twenty somethings life happy sit home play video games day without care world. really surprised church pamphlet left door tips battling covid-19 included: nutrition, light exercise boost immune system, spending time outdoors, drinking enough water, etc. mentioned trust God last bullet point (and also pointed God gave us sunlight water experts conduct scientific studies). partner religion particular, thought pretty neat. Upper room GUV cost 3k per unit 600 per year maintenance. prohibitively expensive, cheap neither. I've reading local community page. LabCorp backed saying today's results June 26. info came local urgent care that's testing people. sitting around crying fretting day going change anything? going bring job back faster. going make feel bad I'm anything wrong. reasonable person would consider emergency, though. get claim anything emergency. 

Authoritarianism vs libertarian ideals binary on/off switch. broad spectrum. Anyone anarcho-communist anarcho-capitalist believes forms authoritarianism. (and, record, political philosophies absolutely bonkers). 

Forcing people wear mask public global pandemic authoritarian sense poking kinda hard forehead assault. technically correct reasonable person going take seriously melodramatic. 

Real, painful authoritarnism Putin imprisoning killing political dissenters, Chinese social credit system, Kim Jong-Un sending political dissenters work camps, American police almost never facing consequences murder. worrying wearing masks public concern yours, live privileged life take lot granted. 100% comes someone hasn’t read study. Part thigh numb that's it. Doubt permanent well. think hat cut ability oxygen reach brain. States received almost financial assistance federal government safety nets running funds, even states well financially. much direct support money think went corporations CARES ACT? Tree shrews too. ""Third people""? mentioned well Germany doing, point nice chunk America well upset you.

I admit found amusing, predictable  *incredibly* long yet still rather incomplete overview article. Still, pretty decent job summing situation. said, point someone needs write book series even longer articles order give proper overview since massive wall text is, still misses *lot*. Things like loosening restrictions facemasks elder care, withholding various kinds information, economic impacts, etc, etc, etc, really touched on. It’s still good sketch overview though. 

It’s bit bad wouldn’t archive images, since graphics comparing various Nordic countries implemented various NPIs quite telling: summary Sweden basically always late never enacted various NPIs compared Nordic neighbors. downplaying virus caused global pandemic, killed 500,000 people infected 11 million. expect? Yeah got barely 10k name *shrug* would still rather homeless risk life schools open European nations month still seems kids dont really get sick. 

It really seems kids fine, exept really small nr, understand dont want sent kids school, ive debated lot. end dicided trust medical community sent school. Hope anyone know love anyone don’t know pass daily course living doesn’t contract it. do, hope worth it. telling why? slows everywhere time, including Sweden. evidence protests spiked anything? Sadly UK infected tories sarcastic, Virus completely uncovered divided racist USA is. horrible. Obama NEVER would let happening USA, happen. talking vaccines take years unless fast tracked, yet get new flu vaccine year. different? be

It fact isn't. Oxford University team's product, called ""ChAdOx1 nCoV-19"", recombinant viral vector vaccine. sort like base platform adjusted different diseases. well understood regulators familiar it. also used strains coronavirus (albeit labs think). oxford group looking September completion, much like seasonal flu, designed quick.

Some vaccine candidates complicated ""cutting edge"". candidates routine available quickly successful.

The ""vaccines take years"" idea come bad reporting IMO. true averages long, true virus' difficult crach meaningless know SAR-COV-2 falls category. Heard woman losing sh*t masks symbol deep south's agenda blah blah....and thought...gawddd...the US toast. Great attitude.

Apparently Japan great vs virus advising karaoke 90% Japanese people capable wearing mask. flu season well. anyone really blame people calling sub doomers there’s ton posts like lockdown great! get play video games literally nothing lot us vote higher populated areas, mostly rural voters. course places higher populations going worse farm towns population ~500. One exception Branson. lot country fried idiots there. two BIG problems facing crews right now. One many countries letting crews disembark go home...but another big problem countries allowing replacement crew (for minimum manning) join ships relieve stranded crews. don’t think country come close “winning” COVID battle. ignorant people “leaders” vaccine candidates sprinting. claiming vaccine ready distribution end year. Bringing vaccine production 9 months prior pandemic unheard (to best knowledge) European, think problem general. know maybe every state America , teach school basic biology (what virus, bacteria, spread, works pregnancy, ecosystem etc... really basic science), learn since time. sexuality basic knowledge, 13-14 years old, bacteria, virus, basic knowledge 11 grow up, knowledge advanced, obligatory learn it. low risk, low cost, seems nonsensical high dose vitamin given nationally help reduce death rate Covid. people try argue left right center wear mask. Hurricanes smart, they'd stay away mess. Even natural disasters know safe Florida. 67% America: ""wtf COVID"". Seriously people care/won't care affects them. point self quarantine much possible take necessary precautions. Science told benefit performing tasks, I’ve seen science I’ve seen ill-effects so. exact reason wear mask travel public transport go shop. Science proves good fellow humans, wear mask. let’s honest, even somehow doesn’t, it’s hardly major inconvenience wear cloth mask 25 mins.

This one health experts couple weeks Contact tracing going fine many places BLM protesters out, cities world. WTF? hope happening America. FHM's notes week later noted soon Ramadan. Public Health Authority talks Swedish Islamic Association information needs disseminated new virus.

On April 7, brainstorming complete. Public Health Authority posted links several languages pandemic.


#Tuesday, March 31: presses government

Ever since first party leadership consultation early March, Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson chasing government tests. rather stifling castle peace [ed note: “Borgfred” Swedish, refers tradition political parties falling line crisis] opposition, question tests breathing hole - Sweden testing anymore? countries do, successfully too.

""To measure know,"" says Kristersson put finger hurts. would Swedish corona strategy little better countries? ""knowledge-based"".

But Public Health Authority changed strategy, aimed tests health professionals seriously ill. Mass testing, Kristersson's demands growing, follow Public Health Authority's plan phase pandemic. 

On March 31, Social Minister Lena Hallengren commissioned Public Health Agency develop ""national strategy"" expanded testing. April 7, FHM notes started working: ""Analogous government assignment, significant upscaling tests prepared.""

But go fast. Perhaps time initiative come expert authority - part Public Health Authority's plan phase.



#Wednesday, April 8: Löfven failure protect elderly

FHM reports day 687 Swedes far died covid-19. infection found every four elderly homes Stockholm County.

In Public Health Authority's ""pandemic preparedness checklist"" December 2019, item labeled: ""Creating routines managing outbreaks special housing, elderly homes nursing homes."" 

Svenska Dagbladet interviews Stefan Löfven asks question:

**What think - managed protect elderly?**

- No, could better, obviously, answers Stefan Löfven.

From on, death elderly care dominant answer government representatives receive questions Sweden failed. Responsibility elderly care municipal.

Löfven's statements elderly raise resurrection abroad - Sweden abandoned elderly? Many Italians Sweden express concern Italian embassy, Facebook explain compatriots ""everything fine"" ""Swedish anomaly"" comes fighting corona.

#Friday, April 17: Testing start

The Public Health Authority presents first version national testing strategy - one ordered government - April 17.

A week later, FHM notes testing still quite started regions. ""Clearly"" case people tested healthcare, writes Inger Andersson von Rosen. always - since strategic change early March - public health test focus.

The moderates kicked government, kicked FHM, hopes regions take responsibility ramping testing.
But regions understand strategy, according survey [Expressen]( , moderately interested. much happens, close target 100,000 week. Lena Hallengren becoming increasingly frustrated.

According Director General Johan Carlson, major problem pandemic - cooperation regions spread.

- Normally advocate self-government, lot initiative this. situation, bottlenecks. allocated different large resources, different commitments political region management, slightly different attitude, Carlson tells SvD today.

#Friday, May 8: system deadlocked

Spring scarcely arrived, snow-mixed rain fall capital within days. funk villa Stockholm, Professor Harriet Wallberg sits home office computer writes final words report medical ethics.

The phone rings, raises phone side line hears Social Minister Lena Hallengren (S). call over, Harriet Wallberg become Sweden's new coordinator testing covid-19.

- government appointed me, perceived frustration minister Ministry Social Affairs testing went slow. mission identify bottlenecks engage dialogue regions, says Wallberg.

Her view responsibility principle worked. 21 regions number infection prevention doctors 290 municipalities autonomy. government responsible country crisis, Public Health Authority experts.

- system deadlocked, says Harriet Wallberg.

On June 4, hard-tested Lena Hallengren another press meeting tests. time six billion SEK almost complete settlement regions.

It two months since Hallengren gave FHM task expanding testing. ""greatly increased testing infection detection"".

- extended testing infection tracking contribution whole. I'm happy that, says Harriet Wallberg.

#Monday, June 22: Sweden - pariah state

“The focus Sweden international news media see unique. Swedish Institute seen much attention traditional media before. "" stated Swedish Institute Director General Madeleine Sjöstedt [at end April]( authority dedicated studying outside world views us. course, positive curious articles written Swedish example. also texts almost described horror depictions.
British [Guardian]( headline ""Sweden plays Russian roulette citizens"", Italian La Repubblica written ""Nordic modeling making dangerous mistake"". ""Sweden's covid-19 strategy amplified epidemic,"" [according France24]( Swedish government forced fight virus, also world around world Sweden fought virus. 
At end May , [Foreign Minister]( Ann Linde hold special meeting foreign diplomats, message: ""As ambassadors Sweden important role inform capitals situation here."" is, ""Correct wrong image spread!""
A heavy blow Swedish establishment comes June 22, New York Times headline ""Sweden trying new status - pariastat"". NYT angle salt Swedish wound arisen since Nordic neighbors chosen close us out.
#Did Sweden challenge death?

Did government expect Swedish model lead higher rates infection countries?

During course article, SVD asked question number actors Government Offices, background interviews interviews. Everyone categorically denied thought. Here's Mikael Damberg answers:

- No, ambition reduce spread infection Sweden, make sure healthcare system coped situation. wanted reduce spread infection properly health care challenged.

- secondly, protect vulnerable groups. Achilles heel, still took elderly home service.


It six months since Inger Andersson von Rosen Public Health Authority hoped ""good 2020"". characterized sometimes violent struggle Team FHM lockdowns. 

In summer program June 24, Anders Tegnell says madness countries closed borders societies. calls destructive - warns might happen open again.

But Tegnell says something pointing another direction also effect shutdowns: ""The infection fell sharply countries extensive lockdowns.""

Tegnell's manager senior government official, Johan Carlson, believe lockdown worked.

- millions people would come home anyway. no, think so, tells SvD today.

**Is Sweden basically ill-equipped pandemic?**

- Yes. system poorly equipped pandemic. would say that.

**Who responsible it?**

- shared responsibility. set pandemic plans late December 19. everyone expected deliver it. supervisory authority, IVO National Board Social Services.

We best system, says Director General.

- totalitarian state, look China, scruples, anything. decentralized society far-reaching self-government extra sensitive. feel well. Funny thing, buddy, straight be, wears skirts like pants. wear shorts, pants. He's unique soul give shit people think him. #Saturday, March 7: Italian traveler arrives home


**Kjell Johansson infected covid-19 March. first got council go work despite risk area.**

**Kjell Johansson worked doctor 40 years.**

Kjell Johansson, 64, Torsås Kalmar worked doctor 40 years. early March, became one line Italian travelers infected coronavirus.

- several old guys usually ski week went Canazei northern Italy first week March year. little hesitant. lot contagion went, careful.

He remembers man sitting sneezing back seat flight flight home March 7.

- really felt shower came seats, landed neck hands. I'm pretty sure infected me. Another company became ill, says Kjell Johansson.

He friends came home one Saturday. Monday would work. Since hazardous area, called contingency doctors Sunday ask advice.

The infection control doctor's answer Kjell Johansson: symptoms, work. then, four days since Denmark invited everyone risk stay home quarantine two weeks.

So Kjell Johansson went work Monday, care center Torsås patients 33 years.

The headaches came late Tuesday. got test Wednesday.

- covid-19. third county. stay home.

Kjell Johansson sick leave three weeks. 

- one think may infected municipal nurse. none patients met Monday Tuesday got sick, pretty nice.
 
#Tuesday, March 10: first strategy change

“There signals social contagion [community transmission] fact, solitary country's metropolitan regions. Thus, strategy shift made focus future limiting effects covid-19. ""

This stated notes telephone meeting Public Health Authority regional infection control physicians.

The week change strategy, FHM Director General Johan Carlson meeting Geneva. 

- everything escalated Italy towards end February, probably saw struggle resist, says Johan Carlson SvD end June. 

Then pandemic upon us.

He says March ""a suspicion"" infection Italy. much later, June, authority would say infection went radar came crawling several directions.

- time, parallel outbreak France particular UK, got influx. pandemic upon us.

In practice, shift March 10 stopping testing infection tracking [contact tracing] foreign travelers symptoms. community transmission means many sick people, huge resources would required test them.

Instead, testing focus severely ill, well health care professionals symptoms. new strategy also formulated goal ensure healthcare system handle pressure, protect particularly vulnerable groups elderly.
 
#Wednesday, March 11: ""As world went crazy""

WHO declares spread covid-19 pandemic. press release, Public Health Agency highlights World Health Organization ""points countries beginning infection take extreme measures"".

The day first Swedish death occurred. deceased 70 years old underlying illnesses, according Region Stockholm.

In [summer talk]( June, Anders Tegnell talks FHM's change strategy March. ""Now time go stopping virus coming here, trying reduce effects much possible.""

“This classic pandemic fight model, discussed international colleagues various meetings past 20 years. big important step, feel dramatic right then, ""says Tegnell Summer P 1, continues:

“Most countries EU situation, thought make decision. world going crazy, everything discussed seemed completely forgotten. ""

According Tegnell, madness consists ""that country country closed borders closed communities altogether"". 

Sweden not. stuck plan.
 
#Saturday, March 14: F-word pronounced - stuck


[*Ed. note: “F word” refers “flockimmunitet” Swedish means “herd immunity English. Swedes use English word “fuck” would know “f word” polite term ‘taboo’ word fuck, play words: meaning “flockimmunitet” ‘taboo’ word.*]

The public health strategy's strategy shift perceived Sweden chose allow higher spread infection population, thus achieving so-called flock [herd] immunity - means many antibodies disease dies out.

One reason one Anders Tegnell's predecessors state epidemiologist, **Annika Linde, [wrote Facebook March 14]( exactly strategy Public Health Authority**. 

A shutdown delay number cases while, restrictions released, cases still come.

Another reason next ex-state epidemiologist, Johan Giesecke - strong ties FHM - believes [almost futile]( try prevent spread:

- shutdown delay number cases while, restrictions released cases still come. believe count number deaths country one year, figures same, regardless measures taken.


The fact Swedish strategy aimed achieving flock immunity denounced Public Health Authority - preferably take F-word mouth anymore.

But thought stuck. repeated [recent report]( written Tore Ellingsen Jesper Roine Stockholm School Economics. conclusion this: Swedish authorities accepted many Swedes would die early, prevent deaths later - second third wave.

The Swedish strategy thus expected, researchers' interpretation, result deaths overall.

#Thursday, March 26: ""Drinking champagne Tegnell's navel""

The outside world reacts Swedish line. big-eyed journalist Danish newspaper Information sees Anders Tegnell invite Danish TV journalist buffet dining room Public Health Authority. ""The buffet super good,"" says Tegnell.

**“From Denmark, almost like diving section German Big Brother. almost expected state epidemiologist would offer journalist drink champagne navel.""**

Andersson von Rosen writes word ""brainstorming"". meeting March 26 finding ideas authority reach ""hard-to-reach groups"", i.e. people Swedish mother tongue. infection protection Stockholm reported infection over-represented Tensta Rinkeby. really sounds like get it. Many states worst outbreak right failed reopening procedure, guess allowing millions students go back school weeks big deal. Definitely nothing see there. June 1st rolling 7 day average 22 262. June 9th 21 289. Want talk maths? fucking put out, asshole. Yeah dude unit decades! CA, AZ? That's it. Due prep work, widespread testing Michigan contact tracing. fudge numbers like southern states actually put lot work add past uncounted probable deaths counts. 

There expected holiday weekend bump, plan test heavily keep control. 

If Michigan get end August without huge jumps driver's seat come winter people much likely accept lockdown necessary again. mention rumored horror stories human trafficking. Young women disappear cruise ships, staff refuse report disappearance customers avoid panic, refuse stall boarding cuts profits, essentially destroying chance finding evidence ship. even imagine. thinking made cry. Covid thing we're dying of. Overloading hospitals way higher death tolls, already happening cities *cough cough Houston Thank good news change. Glad made it. way understand it, also NYS resident, shutdown intended ""flatten curve"". hospitalizations still looking decent regions open. Open =/= pandemic over, believe least seeing social media feeds fact hard comprehend. continue personally take whatever reasonable measures protect family, like New Yorkers choice take greater risks wish to. I'm worried happen tourist attractions colleges reopen. I'm upstate we're phase 4, there's much reason people visit now. Come August, nearby University opening- 17k students state/country. hope college's risk mitigation plan enough prevent spike cases. Estimates wager it’s $13-30 range. mRNA vaccines much cheaper produce don’t raise virus cultures.

It may distribution storage costs add expenses mRNA requires special refrigeration.

That said, paid $200 antibiotic ear drops. Pharmaceuticals squeeze every Today 50 400 tested buildings positive. referred verticle cruise ships. #There political disagreement important listen expert authorities.

The reasoning rounded tested control model best handle crisis: ""It interesting see.""

There nothing wrong Swedish self-confidence corona crisis enters intense phase. government anchored choice - decision Public Health Authority governing - internally February.

Participants GSS could alerted objections ministries, none came. ""There political disagreement important listen expert authorities,"" says one participants. Another believes Sweden knowledge-based tradition countries.

The environmental party could protested, not. ""We party often refers science, example climate issue,"" notes green source government office.

The fact Public Health Authority allowed control Swedish line leads strategy make large parts world gape. seems completely undramatic decision Swedish Government Offices.

Neither opposition parties objected arrangement either. Swedish management model, quite simply. plan, followed.

 
#Monday, March 2: Prepare worst! 

On day Crisis Management Council gathers, researcher Fredrik Elgh warns article SvD Debatt corona virus.

""We must prepare worst-case scenario immediately!"" writes Elgh, consultant professor microbiology, also Center politician.

It constantly said early stages never danger.

He later one group researchers harshly criticize Public Health Agency's strategy - turn deeply questioned. tone research debate often unforgivable spring. 

- constantly said early stages never danger. signals Public Health Authority back corona virus would come here, first China, Italy. came here, says Fredrik Elgh today.

- feel take seriously enough.

 
#Tuesday, March 3: Lack protective equipment 

The Public Health Authority's memo notes identify lack personal protective equipment (so-called PPE, personal protective equipment ). “Access issue regionally, long lived 'just time' stocks. time, great global demand PPE. ""

It pointed Sweden joined common EU system considers ""difficult believe resolve PPE supply"".

The lack protective equipment - whole world fighting - problem emerges early Swedish crisis. 

Nevertheless, point included Public Health Authority's ""pandemic preparedness checklist"" December 2019: ""Plan increased need access peripherals may needed pandemic, protective clothing, needles, respiratory protection, disposable masks"".

Interior Minister Mikael Damberg (S) sits top government's crisis organization. defends Swedish principle responsibility tells SvD beginning summer ""it basically healthy people work deep initiated certain areas everyday life also run lead work crisis"". adds:

- think discussion crisis commission reviewing this, worked well badly.

Protective equipment example worked less well. National Board Health forced take responsibility procurement regions municipalities. worked regions, Swedish municipalities habit reporting National Board Health Welfare.

- take time build new systems 290 municipalities. lot activities elderly care home care across country, says minister.
Damberg says investigated something needs done ""we switch fast enough"".

#Friday, March 6: Nordic countries slide apart

""There high degree consistency Nordic countries,"" notes FHM meeting February. consistency survive month March.

On March 6, Swedish Ministry Foreign Affairs advise travel northern Italy, Sweden thus last Nordic countries advise travel Italian risk areas. 

The pattern repeated March: travel recommendations, closure universities, restriction gatherings - Sweden others, last Nordic countries. 

Sweden recommends travelers risk areas stay home - get symptoms. Nordic countries introducing two-week home quarantine everyone returning.

- staying home two weeks creates false security, convinced that, says Anders Tegnell SVT 6 March.

In several areas, Sweden makes different assessments Nordic countries. Norway closes ski resorts. Instead, FHM's notes mention ""appreciated meeting"" lift owners, cope congestion lift queues après-ski.

Sweden keeps schools open, borders. matters, Nordic expert authorities agreement governments countries.

According Institute Public Health, political decision close Norwegian schools, National Board Health Denmark points proposal close borders come authority, government.

Oh boy. folks Georgia supported two animals killed Amoud Arbhery wont like tables turned them. wonder one get shot complying they'll still support citizens arrest Yes, completely agree... lot education needed.

You actually know pretty good virus got there, even though dead. main issue first 3 months trying find one damn things lmfao fyi come it, credit goes comedian Andrew Santino virus new, known. don’t test positive antibodies doesn’t mean didn’t virus. Negative antibodies don’t necessarily mean immunity (T cells types immune cells important cannot easily test them). Vaccines rely immune cells too. don’t know immunity lasts years disease existence seven months (as far know).

TLDR: It’s bad news. Vaccines could big factor controlling virus long term. individual electoral college? people know names? got back trip started couple days shit went March, Arizona actually. came back quarantined 14 days choice. worked AB shifts we're partially essential.

There nothing definitive yet, keep mind 4th month pandemic, last month majority infections. enough time get virus, recover get infected again. Therefore, enough time following weeks, see reinfections. Firstly isn’t answer question. Unfortunately people need keep vital goods, services (including healthcare) moving/ production don’t always luxury. assume relation sectors circumstances. 


Second, “Stay upwind”, seems completely nonsensical practical application standpoint. Wind direction speeds change dime (such silly departure even worth providing evidence this).


Third, “they” “they’re going tell you”? Labs constantly studying “novel” virus, “if” ways reduce transmission distancing more, differently using technology come out. seems like conspiracy talk me. There's enough space 100 people keep 10 yards away block easily.. Stupid shit like virus isn’t going away anytime soon. Reading article published she’s better job containing virus people think deserve go careless. even says Sweden paradise liberties? Europe stereotype falls US. 
Everyone Sweden life knows queuing Systems (kölappar), alcohol restrictions, smoking prohibitions, bureaucracy. tell silly rules? Protecting non-Smokers passsive smoking? silly...

And curfew meant buying alcohol, unrelated Corona..., right Words would sale ban guess. Sucks party going beer empty BW BY. Well hard post, it. Can't say article anything anecdotal, though, certainly seems like German people care regulations safe potential trip would be.

I think Nordic country let read every privately owned magazine free? can't find every major daily newspaper them, atleast app. guess we're dysfunctional Nordics, huh? imagine heads state going canceling visits US, Corona wait see results incoming election hopefully deal Trump again.  Congress make sure they’ll free liabilities well... increased moisture retention, 

Your knock masks work. suppose moisture exhalations goes collected mask?

And yes, course collect it. optimistic? Denial. already capacity. matter long denied. isn’t new research realm, though. reading possibly airborne now. article I’m linking published June 11th. I’m surprised they’re outright saying news articles, hoping they’d figured exactly much outside (or didn’t) We’re hitting 200k August Maybe take advice friend Yeah kept asking could make trade deal Germany explain that, no, trade deals done EU. Leading example following rules

During Easter, Trudeau family traveled cottage Quebec celebrate daily reminders telling people stay home visit family cottages.

Still salty it. dont want guinea pig. Why? difficult make? Surely works whole world could produce surprise Yep read story. hoping supposed “reinfection” relapse clearly sounds like reinfection. EC 435 members House Representatives + 100 members Senate + 3 representatives DC give 538. That's it. That's get number.

Each election, states award number electors based statewide results divy votes proportionally way. Maine Nebraska distribute based congressional district winners. That's EC.

The real issue existence EC. problems began [Reapportionment Act That's law limited House 435 members rather allowing grow match population case before. law shifted power large states small states House. law, large states held power House (well, like every citizen relatively equally represented), states held equal power Senate (to counteract power large states House prior RA 1929).

Repealing act would one way fix EC issue, would mean House Reps would become way bigger lots members. options could allow Reps cross state borders, may constitutionally illegal. could also increase House set number new Reps, would really make current problem smaller, fix it. could also go full popular vote, negative issues silencing parts country.

Personally, favorite idea allowing House cross state borders, idea make word legally without full Amendment COnsititution probably going happen.

Other pressing issues voting rights: gerrymandering, voter suppression, voter registration deadlines, lack automatic registration, poll locations, polling hours short, enough mail voting, lack voter education, etc. Got “eye fucking.” Wtf they're scrubbing quite bit seems Completely agree us rest world still trying work fuck electoral college is

It's something invented 1700s, backwards nation still thinks appropriate day age. made heart hurt... trying make living wtf... hard time processing evil humans actually be.. Right, things ameliorate need lockdowns virus spreading exponential levels? Bs Lol nobody talks anyway positive samples assessed infectivity SARS-CoV-2, presented data supports previous claims aerosolized viral particles may carried remotely source indoor air currents produced built environment HVAC systems. 

That's key, studies matter much take next step determine particles viable infectious. finding RNA equate finding infection source. Gerrymandering effect Electoral College. Like said, label value me. possible fight good without fighting name.

But you, buddy. Lol wrong Yeah. It’s really worth it. 

I went wedding end February. time, NY/NJ, knew virus way (and turns out, already here.) remember wondering really safe large gathering. three weeks later closing down. find answers survey. individual behaviors, policy instruments - closing restaurants longer, limiting international/interstate traffic more, forth. Why? never ask normally clearly redder zero evidence virus originated lab. happy discuss scientific topics going acknowledge conspiracy theories ton, we're going start seeing videos Karen Floridaman assaulting Disney staff soon reopen. long time since proud country.. Sweden. 

If reddit, might week last time saw virus mentioned, far removed daily routine now. 
So dead even report weekend anymore. ""Corona-cleansing technology"" others puzzling actually simple -- central air system filter high enough MERV rating it.

The real issue idea infections primarily happening via recycled air. studies seen show infection pattern suggests infections happened air made trip system instead air flowed away infected person recycled. is, infected people downstream airflow occurring room, rather upstream/nearer vent.

Putting fancy filter system fix that. $$$... r/Florida nothing shiting NY april. friend nurse England, ER day opened pubs posted pic like 4 drinks saying ""getting wasteeed finally"", people never learn, even healthcare there's dumdums Trudeau guy wore blackface? electricians go school. say didn’t need lockdowns??? said post everything slow spread. Nothing lockdowns. 

I merely pointing saying hospitals MAY overflow alarmist tad hyperbolic. could definitely become capacity, likely won’t IMO. Still, read it. laughed outside crying inside reading this. Meanwhile admin people making millions continue home-office... one thing I’m worried about. covid airborne it’s likely seasonal. means spreads less efficiently summer hot months. However it’s spreading quite quickly hot weather regions right now. may less deadly infectious. remains seen. 

But it’s seasonal spread right tempered warmer weather. covid weakened state what’s going happen come fall winter? guy buzzkill think would take leadership, considering many deniers elected leader, eh? view attack? serious question, ca't understand written brain, bother trying rephrase it. Sometimes milk transformed sold powdered milk, ice cream, cheese etc. it’s carton milk watch for. argue him, he's russian troll trying spread division shitty milk/there’s better milk? love milk! *What missing on?* probably lower BP, healthier organs less pills ever STFU. old even? comparing child. spike new cases started 2-3 weeks ago. Deaths tend lag 4-6 weeks. theres fact new infections among younger healthier people, treatment virus improved significantly since March. 

If see significant increase daily deaths end July I'd astounded. Good. correct, reasonable thing do, many levels. 
Strike that, **on every conceivable level**.

*""Mommy says I'm sick something con-tay-gee-ous care wanna play, nyah nyah nyah. Come play grownups me.*"" Sure, disagree OPs main point, labeling person healthy makes people take COVID seriously. person unhealthy, person reading probably likely unhealthy themselves, whether consider unhealthy not. Lol

And *exactly* *informed* this?

By non answers snark? Hahahah

Sorry, can't hear sound 500 years colonization requisite white tears whining move forward break apart..

Enjoy watching happen 😉 100%. Smoking joint St. Pete beach July 4th watching endless fireworks get shot random boats ocean surrounded young people peak experience me. implies gave shit prior 100k shut bars mandatory mask order place, however can’t enforce it, that’s also reality here. 
 
Why not, exactly?  also allows talk doctor get prescription pretty much immediately. infection telemedicine like 2A, prescription ready woke back up. much better waiting appointment really necessary. Apparently eastern Ontario acting together it, four health units issuing order effective midnight tonight. 10m never leave home. good time unionize, then. Work schedule allows nine interrupted lockdown days home row.

Go first day groceries liquor store, stay home. paradise. Sleep later. leisurely breakfast coffee, read paper. Listen podcasts. lunch wife works home. Matinee film double feature. Happy Hour cocktails deck 530pm every day. Nice leisurely dinner. Cigars afterwards. Evening double feature whatever streaming. Read books ever right around bedtime. Well things consider:

1. average age cases dropped significantly. Meaning impacting age bracket less lethal, though still dangerous. likely vulnerable age ranges staying home younger ones venturing out.
2. Deaths lag behind cases week two. We'll know end week.
3. number deaths/day still high. seven day average 500. Keep mind year would put us close 200,000 deaths (high virus). certainly better 1,000 2,000 day likely result hospitals overwhelmed NYC staff getting sick reducing care. now, we're hovering close overwhelmed many areas still threshold hospitals time prepare plan. Trudeau good
Trump bad Trying hybrid model *college's* plan B- student's. point best students expect likely outcome (open campus) try disappointed everything goes sideways.

ETA- Cuomo say two weeks ago college students could likely return campuses come fall, infection rate better then. sure can! they're called grad students adjuncts!

That's university doing:

* TT faculty teaching upper-level lectures online option coming campus all.
* host newly-hired adjuncts teach freshman-level lectures person (the 200-seat weed-out classes, held normal capacity) handful classes cannot taught online like ceramic arts, theater, etc. Apparently enough unemployed PhDs area pull off.
* grad students handle 100% face face student contact (office hours, recitation, exam proctoring) continue spend 20 hours week teaching windowless basement lab classroom like before. Lab classes full capacity (30 students). bags milk NB too. can’t cause lady FB says numbers fake count tests wrong. think happened states spiking states high enough caseload enough tests spring indicate big problem brewing, unlike NY/NJ already spread widely &amp; deeply earlier year, testing ramp around shutdown time, already lots infections circulating around. entire country handled exactly manner NY timings, many states probably would've spared virus. least got control we're seeing FL, TX, AZ. US need referendum covid-19. exactly would unified approach be? 

And please answer reducing cases \*today\*, three months. course slow transmission reduce cases July - delaying inevitable comes back soon emerge caves, tourist brings again? big picture objective saves lives anticipated remainder life pandemic? mitigation slows transmission get number cases stop spread (whatever saturation point is), spreading impact period many months would otherwise sooner? understanding spikes limited resources, obviously want avoid shortages cost lives. optimum rate transmission gets gets us back productivity treating conditions put hold this, without overwhelming limited resources? guess I'm asking is, believe ""beat it"" (not slow down) stop virus short working vaccine 6 months forever away future (how's vaccine SARS ... oh - none worked)? anyone actually beat come back? science evidence beat mitigation (not slow come caves again), example world someone beating strain we're battling, central message rallying cry compliance. everyone board flattening curve. They'll clearly expressed strategy. certain type antibody. body many different ways fight this. get much prepared fight it. mentioned considerate people 10 threads posted around Reddit weekend, woman mentally ill. mean slangish way, detached needs professional help. trash cans need make twentieth snarky political comment day, so... Stop harassing us Putin. Still mad U-boat? sounds like ""under ideal laboratory conditions"" situation I'm sure sign waiver, Disney lawyers fuck around. That’s fair. Like said earlier, I’m skeptical read online, rarely do. 

So question probably flirt uninformed/naive. noticed trend curious. Apologies asking repetitive question would hard elected official ban BLM protests, would hard ban Reopen/Anti-lockdown protests. one agree protesting either reasons smart idea pandemic, would set bad precedent Constitutions 'Right Assemble' try ban sort protest would likely challenged court. wizard it. What? even talking about? see gets bizarre ideas from. looks obese photos. 87 90 case want know big place is.  thanks doctor asshat, im glad diagnose young girl's health problems couple shitty angled photos. TIL word picayune, thanks. Indian government expecting vaccine day independence like manager expecting project done company's founding date something. /r/coronavirus /r/fatpeoplehate collide Dam even kink shaming!

Netherlands wear masks apart public transport 

But Dutch people ride everywhere bikes. Lol, guys still trying make thing? short condensed answer yes, difficult produce even difficult scale effectively. types drugs usually made Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. genetically change CHO cell produce protein want produce. make big bank cells subdivide multiple banks, heavily scrutinized. grow cells (21ish days ballpark figure) maybe 15,000L, time monitoring cell viability, metabolites, pH level, dissolved oxygen, multiple factors yield product small roughly 5g product per litre solution. purify using several different techniques, expensive (think like 10+ mil purify batch) difficult create process parameters for, time losing product due intrinsic nature purification. eventually get product 100 tests complete ensure efficacy safety, well holding samples conduct stability studies.

Normal synthetically produced medicines could scaled use v quickly, types drugs process product setting production facility produce monoclonal antibody takes least months. Never even minding logistics licencing product manufacturing elsewhere. time founder company holds manufacturing rights legally responsible product made, company makes error somewhere founding company deal it. Probably significant sunlight physically killing virus boosting vitamin levels, mood, things sunshine, fresh air, outside overall health. better overall health, better odds surviving getting sick if/when exposed. People could see devastating situation person Covid go through, everyone would little more.  vote psychopath option November, maybe we'll get little leadership next year. IAMA First time expecting father December full time nervous wreck,

So wondering mind couple questions:

* old daughter now, long ago ?
* point pregnancy get sick long last ?
* sickness itself? fever else ? long know fevers scary womb?
* risks doctor explained you? outline risk normal development ?

Sorry I'm probie Usa! Usa! nursing home stats factor too, that's many variables me. agree, point work places telling employees sitting small enclosed space others safe long 6 feet apart fails smell test think small droplets/aerosols. Shop hard! never broke 100k cases day USA. information wrong.  need offer random person internet education right this? lucky anyone took time inform lol, people would laugh go day... rare potentially life-threatening occurrence arises soon infection coronavirus causes covid-19. symptoms affect whole body, including fever, skin rashes, breathing problems, sudden drop blood pressure (shock) deprive organs oxygen lead death. syndrome likely result flawed immune response virus, rather symptoms caused directly study, researchers identified 27 children suffering symptoms consistent MIS-C. these, four also neurological symptoms. included headaches, neck stiffness, sensitivity light, trouble speaking, swallowing, walking. four children also experienced muscle weakness two reduced reflexes. tests, evidence damage brain’s corpus callosum, region helps two sides brain communicate one another. Interestingly, none children reported respiratory symptoms, despite testing positive coronavirus antibodies children contract coronavirus develop serious symptoms less likely sort flu-like symptoms seen adults. MIS-C considered rare treatable existing anti-inflammatory drugs, especially caught early. right now, real sense often happens, children develop it, prevent it. It’s children worry neurological problems connected covid-19, either; adults also similar complications post-infection. many survivors live lingering neurological health problems unanswered question. think anyone died hill, thing anyone said anything milk. Lockdown helped us figure lot stuff basic biology virus, ramp manufacturing. come lockdown know universal masking, social distancing handwashing help limit spread. Except people like refuse engage simple precautions.

Also, plenty vaccines give lifelong immunity, that's get flu shot every year. already inject monthly, big deal add corona vaccine every six months. Ironic know damn well they're gonna make people sign waivers, I'm guessing Disney lawyers make near impossible normal people sue. .000162% population only. 17 years pace Sweden infected! #NothingBurger literally wrote comment, good theory. I'm gonna guess company policy. live Canada, company HQ'd Canada pays CAD. told CEO I'm moving Merida (Mexico) winter, said hell yeah it. conversation compensation would change think should. gets nuanced, Bob's compensation partially based city's cost living, that's included contract, might change, situation that's specifically said contract.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: think one biggest bonuses working remote live somewhere affordable. huge problem lot junior guys / girls company. try live downtown get slaughtered cost rent here. moved hour out, would whole different story. forgot four countries world! Silly me. Zyzz blew roided heart 22 sitting still sauna we're gonna act like 16 year old girl, who's coma dying btw, picture unhealthy existence overweight. probably better medical readings half posted thread big chill shit Mr. Late Twenties Pills. 



Think implication saying moment. 16 year old nominal medical readings get absolutely destroyed virus overweight, happens virus get bad flu, bad cold, bronchitis, lower respitory infection? promise you, better even fit fiddle. What's interesting terrible things shake faith often make people double-down it. twitter video chat option? bet he’d use  Well least getting laugh expense lobster industry. Trump fucked Chinese trade deal sent business Canada.  would forced labour opposite freedom. going get voted someone ""poses"" question many times throughout day. need cut paste reply. deaths still going down? Hopefully we've gotten better treating virus protecting vulnerable populations. celebration opening super premature. We've spiking maybe 3 weeks. Deaths lag behind. People also claimed things reopening causing cases weeks ago are. FL probably fewer tests staffing shortages holiday weekend. 

Every Monday like clockwork, somebody surprised lower numbers, realizing Monday's numbers Sunday's numbers Sunday's numbers always low. ...and succeeding worked hard often possible 1970s, chances kept degrading since then. Nowadays, chances succeeding without college degree close nil – college degree guarantee success anymore. Donald finally gotten Mexico build wall. Haha company still plans move everyone offices increase productivity.

I’ll soon potentially 3hr 30 commute. video teens Germany. didn’t even need hear speak German know wasn’t shot America. actually healthy overweight. fat person seen. Nope, opposite said. definitely deaths less. Nice try though. 😂😂 Theres thread subreddit ""volunteer"" help local hospital forgo mask.

Seems like pretty good court mandated community service session thats educational.

Also would required wear mask entire duration work 20 minutes takes shop. I'm getting tested partly due I'm one believes get tests. live somebody risk person. Also, dont symptoms He’s probably referring head CDC’s statement [“best estimate right every case that's reported, actually 10 takes 3m confirmed cases 30m total around 10% population Thank you. try distance reading news articles find end going crazy. listen governor. Wear mask, maintain distance, go day.

Just got intrigued saw downward trend deaths. Next week it'll flagship series ESPN. play devil's advocate, people family round faces. 

I doubt given stats US, weird response article lmao live rural sask amount people around want wexit insane. start talking logistics forming new country stop listening lol. like bunch toddlers tbh been? Zoom headlines months based numerous security issues. don’t actually use end end encryption, say do. called say define end end encryption differently. Lol yeah define established encryption policies differently /s. They’ve also found routing traffic China. 

Don’t think president using shit platform. Full lock required least 2-3 months. It’s way.

Edit: whole country working together saw headline epidemiologist Imperial says immunity COVID “fragile short-lived”.

Is true, not? Sounds really bad true. Pandemic not, fuck would say HELL fast trump toupee would spin hollow head. fuck asks people visit right now? GTFO goddamned moron. He's alright cases, two major issues really disappointing:

Proportional representation - full promised it, half-assed survey show ""it's canadians want""

Their current firearm ban they've misrepresented statistics facts straight lied it. Hope find good deal! friendly ‘not always’ here. arrested bench warrant (due court filing documents correctly prior dui conviction). who, speeding, arrested even sent long term facility spent four days worked out. attorney. Side note: didn’t say one word entire time announced pa pack things cause going home, started crying. One inmate says “girl, crying?” response “because guys didn’t beat up.” least twenty got bunks helped get sheets bed prepare leave. also confirm you’re system, it’s nearly impossible get out. that's him. live Africa lost job virus limited data phone can't watch videos. mention students. US college structured is, millions students rely loans scholarships order money make - might voided skip semester. We're scared campus reopening, happens August. Administrators mandating masks students, said faculty might even need wear masks, properly distance. Luckily, county mandating masks. care faculty, staff, students, money.  talking lab theory February weeks later start reject claims. childish already read mainstream media nonsense. Fact would never know virus came. much politics science overpasses truth. Oh damn Mexico really build everything sleep O'rangers! woman CEO PR firm. 

She's obviously reasonably high-functioning, right? Although numbers small, record Oregon's current growth period cases going month now, totalling half overall cases. deaths today. airborne suggest seasonality? virus takes weekend Well, least, one movies, President USA hops airplane attacks giant alien ship. stupid move, maybe sending President frontline tactics could save USA right :) flu first time 7 years ago, late 20s. Holy shit worse sickness I've ever had. numerous days fever, chills, lack sleep brutal. I've gotten flu shot every year since. But—but mUh FrEeDoM!!1! Idk man. seems aggressive could danger society. don’t think doctors deal physically aggressive people street aka outside mental hospitals. what? take social distancing seriously  definitely agree, I'm means advocating working sake work. idea nature demands you. what's fulfilling you? write books, make music, create something help people, service people (teaching, raising family, et cetera). even excersize, humans naturally stagnant. ,

it's meaningful make music, that's do. I've people reach say much music meant important,. also help guide friends family, read time help them. even one person effect, know 10 people effect on. excersize often well staying healthy also something value. 

thats longer wanted lmao, find meaningful. I'm still young (early 20s) hope make much bigger impact years go on. I'm now. really many? Like food courts not? Ive never Monday effect? theme parks reserve time come back time. wait, necessarily line. digging os zoom say regarding HIPAA ""millions people""

👁️: 81 Fucking moron, poor Latino Black populations really unhealthy start with, waited last minute get health care afraid costs.

The white man keeps down, give hope, educate give access good health care. fucking stupid you? Even put lag still dropping math game. percentage tested end getting hospitalized. 

No matter way spin there's young people hospitalized before. 

A Texas Doctor said 10 young patients need ecmo pick three No, it’s even saying scary. It’s quite simple.

N95 higher protects wearer catching virus (eyes still vector!). There’s reason healthcare workers wear protect eyes.. protect you. Anything lower protect wearer sufficiently, lower amount droplets potentially take in. Less always better. 

For preventing spread EVERYTHING helps. homemade masks 3 layers cotton works, surgical mask works, N95 higher masks work - everything. Obviously different levels efficiency, help. word patients clearly written top screens then? said patients misleading word here. lie, patients wrong word here? repeating previous comment? started following days ago damn wrecked me. Idk wife kept going like also idea leg amputation till today husband call police. publicly posted video vandalizing Target business Instagram account. hard figure lives. month now, sub freaking predicting catastrophic rise deaths, yet happen.

Have seeing what’s happening south? purposely stupid? say that?

*looks probably made deal devil Asymptomatic. cost Dementia

No. didn't. 

Both unfit office. one done far less damage US other. guess one I'm talking about, much cult-member red-hats 'haha lib' cult members? seem really saying year. research reading prior BLM news coverage US indicated people verifiably contracted virus overcome maintain immunity 2 3 months. know tracks vaccines, would assume related. Everyone around gets tested daily many days 100-1 mil?

The jump 1-100 really rather lengthy remember correctly. Phase 3 late stage testing? thing phase 3 launch approval (i.e. FDA double checks data weighs risks v. benefits). Phase 4 happens drug released. Chavs can't afford go pub. Blame wine bar patrons posh twats need service remind important are. True Frenchman? biohazard symbol trick. Yea, makes sense, distribution going probably hardest part, especially anti vax group. I'm student, hope get relatively soon released pretty high vector spread. OP putting bullshit words title problem. way overreacting, record. Kids done well Covid far part pediatric deaths occurred 1 age group.

Well, bunch countries eagerly gleefully ready point faults, kind obviates need self-critical. Fuck ya! Gochu fam. people like yes. would riots banned AC here.  right. autistic kids already missed much social skills classes therapies this. country/city that? It’s 2 weeks decline v rising inflection new cases. Next two weeks interesting watch. deaths don’t rise, might signal change approach going forward. understanding done. I'm trying create fear skepticism, simply hoping proper testing vaccines working tight deadlines. 

Sidenote: think antivaxxers antivaxxers? news you... You’re medical professional. Look USA antimask idiots corona spreads still dare write massive bullshit? 
Wear fu??ing mask chances better without. could try dispute exact numbers, nobody says exact. Based repeated downvotes seems though majority thread accept open school year vaccine available. Weird thing is, CEO PR firm. Camping absolutely higher risk— 6 simply testing identifying cases across broader population. 

That’s it. Expect obvious “trend” continue. 

The official case mortality rates inflated 4.5%+ USA average known actual mortality rate 1%.

So means aren’t even capturing 1/4 actual amount cases. would too. probably smells like ham farts. question might sound stupid, please kind.  fabric masks supposed fitted nose, way cover nostrils? I've bought couple double layered cotton masks keep problem, almost get inside nose breathe in. used N95 surgical masks definitely flexible way/ get sucked nostrils.

I want modify cotton masks add something would make stay away nostrills, like wire maybe bit rigid sponge make ""tent"" effect tip nose, without creating gap elsewhere know would defeat purpose wearing all. say ""patients"" says age getting infected. Don’t care all. dairy cartel country fucking sinister. receive huge government handouts fuck Canadians lobbying dairy protectionism, making us pay way dairy-based products starting days see numbers start go way everyone parties.  awesome private insurance, able take weeks present lifestyle, without hurting finances. *cries ‘I **still** haven’t received mine’...* can’t. 

I really hope China’s system government something similar doesn’t turn effective fixing this, I’m really worrying might since USA systemically unable rise occasion. Yep. Psychological splitting action. nothing think ain't healthy. Exactly. example want others see. travel consider sort representative country visiting someone else home. much better technologies texting video calls.

There technologies allow let connect two rooms two distant locations (using simple cameras video projector) one (falsely-)larger room. Also, think augmented reality.

Still, mention, may share examples agree conclusion. Sadly no.. golden corral. sad reality many us already tackling serious health problems. Next three weeks key. We’re 2 weeks inflection point cases declining v rising nationwide. don’t see death rates rise significantly might change approach things. Except says average age people getting infected decade half younger, say patients. got sick 2-3 times earlier year lot me. worked open office would usually get sick 2-3 whole year year. feel spent half January sick. 

They awful flus too. feel like thing coming back waves. Nausea, force eat. lost scent really stomach issues though. remember.. 

Now I'm sick really done much months I'm couch feel entire body I'm cold sweats. can't concentrate drove get covid tested morning (they closed holiday) basically drove red light. temp fine 96ish ordered accurate thermometer I've using meat therm. 

I've feeling super lethargic days. kind assumed depression feel way worse today weekend. correct best case herd immunity 50%, means 5 times infected (and dead) over. That's 650,000 dead. Best case herd immunity scenario. die third week know specific examples vaccines created short time periods? I'm pretty sure still isnt even AIDS vaccine. nypost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Take morgue show consequences driving influence? Idk well works that. Everyone thinks ""that me""  native English speakers imply actively fight illness virus? nothing, can't beat it. quality immune systems pure luck everything else depends treatment. anyone ever dealt people bringing pets Walmart, mask thing exactly like everywhere. testing enough that?

Also, US really working hard keeping first place. imagine epidemiological knowledge average journalist.

Now imagine Redditors consume even digested diluted form Sorry hear that. unfortunately can’t individually take every persons life account. billions ways shop online get friends help. bad asthma sucks I’m breathing problems wear mask. alternative much much worse. basically covid bingo either mask make arrangements. even weirder think people eligible priority vaccine happily deny it, vaccine.   

But yeah definitely weird think many vaccine stocks waiting approval! wondering much money Canada could make yearly raffle one free automatic citizenship.. Normal man.

Herd immunity viable option. one wants anyone die, would great somehow thing became less deadly. Numbers show people die increase means people die this. i'm surprised nike, armour capitalized making masks ""cool"" Psychosomatic It’s cycle isn’t pretty. Florida thought control (because really never got hit hard considering data made sense.... neglecting second wave process) New York could certainly problem. Especially since it’s travel hub. think you’re 100% right ask question. gives shit China invented toothbrush look don’t disagree you, wouldn’t wearing mask also pose risk people certain heart conditions? like air conditioner filters make ACs work hard move air, face masks make lungs/hearts work harder move oxygen breathe. I'll see tom hanks Bill Murray.. exactly POTUS directed fuked. Trump blame him, watch.

Given many workers informal utter lack social safety nets, prolonged lockdowns inevitably cause riots. lot people risking COVID death put food table.

The best thing masks strictly enforced. economy still churn limiting daily cases. op asked general public. assume trials pass start reproducing it, go military, first responders, medical people, government officials, nursing home residents, especially vulnerable, etc etc long goes general public.

What noticed need greater emotional support, training, mentorship ""adults"" lives - family, educators, managers, etc. - increasingly pervasive lack interest/recognition making investment among people 40. 

I've also noticed increasing world-weariness/resignation seems directly tied lack economic opportunity. least US, 22 year olds graduate college going ton work debt jobs pay $45k they're lucky lot fairly mindless work little control little clear path growth advancement. look people 10 years older see still struggling problems. can't say blame them. terrified canceled yet. live 15 min away fair brings people everywhere another breeding ground virus agree that. appear NYS better simply flattening curve, long state continue right path every state running ""experiment"". 1% chance dying ‘extremely low’ even close! one causes worth dying for. access article video, picture dude bike.

Kudos you! Didn’t Whitmer delay reopening Michigan spike protests? think mask wearing BLM protests vs reopening protests probably made big difference seeing cases BLM protests. think something weird going yet understand. Yes, deaths delayed 2-3 weeks behind cases. Yes, treatment protocols better. Yes, younger people unlikely die.

In country (Netherlands) saw people mostly abandon social distancing yet cases deaths tracked extremely low levels.

I think virus somehow fading away. Remember, found waste water long emerged Wuhan, guy thinks viruses dormant require specific conditions emerge disappear too. Maybe happening  never go back way was.

Comme ci, comme ça Vaccine clinical trials generally take years. Like, 6-7 years. discussing potential vaccine could theoretically available form public next year. That’s 5-6 years faster clinical trial data review. like 8 months also legitimate issues certain people autism sensory issues. We’ve worked around keeping family members home. first flight day pretty full. seen 1 person airport without mask general concourse area. Could Americans world favor stop hating calling humility.

I 50 several serious health conditions. also take care elderly parents. 

I wish things safe enough 100% person learning — isn’t. I’m tired people claiming teachers lazy prefer distance learning time. well really REALLY stupid people talking about, course dont understand them. Might well different species dumb are. surge deaths, sure, think reason hope death rate bad was. seem figured treatment works, know ventilation absolute last resort ventilator worsened lot outcomes. 

Though hospital capacity, availability health care workers play role too. Exactly. rate stabilizes would take 23 years US get it. That's assume like measles.... not.

I think need check math exponential can't become immune... (for sustainable period). vaccine would last 6 12 months (to generous).

Well, virologists exactly sure immunity looks like yet. presence antibodies may may confer immunity. don't, immunity happening another process, possible. So, antibodies appear sticking around long time, yet know means protective immunity I'm baffled many lack type understanding.

Blame leadership blame lousy reporting. Listen Week Virology podcast get view actual evidence-based thinking like subject. yeah coming sub makes angry detracts $17/hr essential shitty job working home. everyone think Americans stupid people around world exact thing keep going? ""allowed protest""? country live in? produced exhale wasted done mouth microchip BSoD? Okay underlying conditions matter? Ok got it. US leading deaths countries could recording deaths differently? I’m trying think sorry I’m seeing things clearly.

I calculated things county.
In Bexar County Texas 14,500 people tested positive estimated 2 million. .007% counties population. 122 deaths county. .000051% counties population. 

When numbers doesn’t seem add people saying. missing here? ""I dislike cult celebrity"" here, people like TH actually use influence get people good world like contribute charities, vote, take events like pandemic seriously I'm it. seen usually celebrities absurdly famous well known long periods like TH good will, gaining sudden popularity tend go abuse most. research shows every case confirm testing, 10 cases.

That number changed time testing available used be. buzz words. extrapolated post could really shed light talking going vid myself. Seems similar shortened influenza flu. Great actor. first feature role volleyball scene Top Gun. Prior-before. Intake-joining team current season.

Asking questions doesn’t imply someone doesn’t think virus dangerous. You’re literally making assumptions. anti-maskers? trolling attention? willfully blind? dumb? evil want people die? really don’t understand... said March, got 20 downvotes here. I'll get limes.

So anxiety, nothing see bois gurls. /s Houston, live large apartment complex still people it’s 20% residents wearing masks Agreed, feel though year started we're going second half. Gen Z reside hometown? Hello!

I diagnosed COVID, symptoms since last Thursday. running fever, coughing small amount, aches/pains/headache, abdominal discomfort. doctor recommended rest, fluids Tylenol. 

My question is, specific milestones look ? Meaning, early indications could get really bad ? really honestly dont feel bad, like mild flu. dont chest tightness people expressed.

Yesterday felt almost totally normal, went outside yard work, today im feeling worse. 

Im 51 year old male, pretty good shape. serious medical conditions. 

Thanks advance!! get feelings anecdotes upvoted... Absolutely. business first foremost, especially giant research university. admins never diminish pay (including lot plum perks like cars housing allowances, especially top) mst assuredly places faculty unionized capacity. staff part-time/non-tenure stream faculty massacred first that's well way. block stations spewing bogus information child safety functions TV? married? 🙏🙏🙏 system garbage. put lot people ""disposable"" category. worst thing many people still universal Healthcare. Also I'd rather someone punch mouth, fine $880 something done themselves. took nearly month reopening cases spike hard, current spike states opened soonest. Give time, we'll see happens Young adults likely engage social behaviors matter are, congregating thousands one location would catalyze situation would escalate much campus setting home town Without unified approach, basically like designated peeing section swimming pool. one actually wants death rate climb. That’s sick misconception opposing position. better way keeping death rate besides letting virus spread like wild fire trying find comfort death rate. majority hospitals 5-25 ICU beds start (just context) I’m rushing year pass, knows lies ahead. Could well be.



But must also remember scientists University researchers Chinese payroll. Everything control That’s froze science coming Taiwan. It’s like scientific data doctors scientists deemed invalid originated politically contested territory. nothing else, make us examine view bit closer make sure ones misled, never bad thing.

Bill Murray sort watched heard it, stuck hand said I’ll make sure gets properly disposed off, proceeded chug it. It’s unfortunate ones hurt elected officials chose to. I’m fine wearing mask. I’m fine illegal govt. mask mandates. Businesses force masks, that’s fine. federal govt authority national level. Yeah hope loudest stupidest fewest. matter time cant leave enter different parts United States. going build walls within border Northern States keep Southern residents vice-versa. mask new reason civil war? 

Im partially kidding also kinda started see New York want people going FL vacation home come back without quarantining themselves. 

If could predicted way Jan, Feb, March, April, May.... Instead lead believe gonna float away done heat comes. Maybe 15 cases most. 

156,000 new cases July 4th weekend. bound start getting million week. keep pleading Mother wear mask goes places. people fully understand scope casually roll hospital sick, that's people used to, hospital says ""Sorry, can't help you. Go home. Stay home. hope die"" mom pretty religious told would praying like never catches shit. tried get imagine country nurses doctors overwhelming, worked prepared run room happens? 

We country care shit happens sudden shit becomes real. Anyone explain gets better continues get really bad?

If can't get people wear mask makes us think get people vaccinate? going see effects virus decade least. Buckle folks, ya know seat belts thought impede constitution use widely accepted law. seat belts work. means, many knew early silly cute ""we say SOMETHING"" advice, really never helped much

What help, people wont do. Wear masks, everywhere. fucking public be. latter one impossible expect Americans Man fucked would higher death rate really brings home what's going world right now. 😭😭😭 any? Within subject interest, is. Finally logic coming higher institution. Yeah, babies really concepts friends social needs either. Taking kids school really cramps ability develop socially. part true

Also think behaving ""as if"" someone environment fact benefit anyone acts assumption (i.e. follows guidelines) long run. would exercise caution optimism. Based saw mine others’ Facebook feeds, beaches around state absolutely filled brim weekend. I’m sure enough kill virus UV also present night well. Yet people saying “stay home you’re scared”

Must nice asthma, asshole difference strict academic review research public guidance. 

For instance - maybe don’t full research data COVID19 transmission small droplets. good data influenza SARS sufficiently similar diseases say “until research, wear masks precaution”. Like go err side precaution maybe walk back research later shows otherwise. 

But opposite. explicitly told public wear masks - even homemade ones - current evidence showing masks effective.  

This pattern keep seeing. they’re failing providing useful current source guidance information. Specific hospitals filling. Texas ton hospitals though, maybe hospital region may fill Texas probably won’t. Southeast Texas presently [50% bed Yelling ? Didn’t know could yell screen..

Don’t come saying i’m wrong didn’t watch video him. 

Thanks. Reported.  Yep. tracking transmission using video elevators impressive. know that. Based around county, look way I'm good indicator. look that. That's I've hearing others experiencing myself; tried stay away lot reports psyching out, later went check symptoms heard others started noticing things, like lingering joint pains, suppose may COVID complications. 

The memory loss REAL. I'm massive Star Wars fan (particularly comes lore minutiae writing / gaming purposes) I've started forgetting really basic shit; that's know remnant disease. things I'd never forget, otherwise, I'm far young suffering even early onset Alzheimer's anything sort. fuck's sake, left kettle walked away go bed. roommate finding steaming explode, knows could happened.

Please, Rona. adult asthma days I’m perfectly fine wearing mask days feel like I’m suffocating :( mentions antibodies waning thought immunity much complex that? doesn’t matter said not, didn’t provide evidence claim. People say lot things. mean air travel? shared globally using zero profit model. Manufacturing agreements already place. think AstraZeneca make much/any money vaccine.

Yeah, title ""news"" confused me. thought known spread air awhile - thus masks. news? Quick reminder: Peer review (especially quality peer review) slow. One challenges facing pandemic act incomplete information always time studies go full review process.

Conversely, lot published COVID-19 gone rigorous process review revision.  supervision

And issue. Masks proven slow spread saves lives. understand people like want save many lives everyone stock masks home really. take much space lot uses.

DeSantis pointed deaths Florida among people 65 older said state’s focus trying keep people age range exposed virus, protecting nursing homes.

Since elderly live nursing homes, policies using specifically protect seniors **I think** we’ve stabilized we’re at,” DeSantis said.

So he's guessing.  see link. look daily tests done country see ballpark. BUT, inaccurate negative test result takes fraction test, two different things (tests versus test results) distinguished source far tell. 1% positivity, instance, pooling get 100 test results 10 tests. 30% positivity, there's nothing either run every test, (what instead 14-day backlog samples waiting tested) calling presumptive positive moving useful test.

Another example China testing Wuhan within ~two days. needed find 6 positives within 10 million samples, theory could done 100 tests total (in practice probably far higher, still trivially tiny compared 10 million results got). even they'd actually done 10 million tests, that's still 1/100 population tested two testing made priority

Yes. coronavirus cases small, testing incredibly efficient. However, still contact tracing isolation important parts process. first world country

Yeah bro, I'm sure maintain 10% unemployment several years, happily that.. It’s hot Gov figured 100% opening pretty soon lockdown best call Wear masks wouldnt happened. Bus driver lives matter!!!!!

So, next time see someone without mask, ok kill them? Stupid people. Texas right seeing massive delays making appointment getting results (7-14 days). Might well setting appointments every third day make sure get test time.

In Austin, also processing tests symptomatic patients, New England ever another outbreak/spike, every 3rd day shit certainly go window. copy paste another one replies:

Given ICE exemption spring semester, guess agency, like administration, implicit/explicit orders move pandemic start treating COVID-19 non-issue. So, look lens, sort say stupid decision.

But incredibly difficult see officials tune news college-age people, outright college students college towns getting infected thousands. fact, that's rather huge talking point certain politicians. case, would much line policies ICE designed discourage various forms immigration making process painful dangerous. would willfully evil. effective way protect covid without wearing masks taking precautions like distancing

This entirely conjecture based scientific evidence all. Huh. guess pure coincidence cheap remedies dangerous patent-protected remedies gods gift life earth. announced it, july 27th match transit date. hope move forward, it’s set least. Karen said going inside doesnt help anything though! /s That’s true, you’ll notice deaths lag infections weeks. means won’t see death spike recent spike infections weeks. 

If go bottom US page Worldometers, see lag. initial big wave infections hit mid-March, deaths didn’t start spiking April. Hmmmm Sports also factor. campus students means campus sports. That’s big financial loss too. don’t see college football happening fall. Mildly concerning. That's going looooong wait since one wants us! I'll dead countries want Americans there. LOL, link? going show say wrong deaths surge?

I think will. Lol... sure let know gone. wonder many years disease pass realize wrong. That's true. 

There also recovery factor. also survival factor. Currently hospitalization length stay coronavirus patients half was.

There infections recoveries fewer deaths. Yup help even Dr Fauci saying masks useless early whole grade school (current administration people ignoring mask rules) messing select likely case. Remind me! 1 month see graphite, there! actually died. That's use much orange paint hold stick. clear we're longer sprint. We're marathon.   agree least year vaccine that's accessible people. Mass immunization likely come 2022, even then, Toner says vaccination may require double dose effective. think mask wearing degree social distancing, living -- hopefully living happily -- several years,"" says. even remotely sustainable? Deaths continue decline week week. know it’s binary outcome really addressing reopening accelerate.  Average means nothing. One 3-year-old getting infected brings national average years. 
I'm concerned median infection age. Secret Service restricting access anyone seeing tested daily and/or isolated first. the? could sworn 130K cases entire country. don’t think nobody gave shit. People die alone time - nurses step room short there’s change come back patient died, family doesn’t make time, etc. Especially elderly patients slip away quickly without much forewarning. unfortunately, early pandemic, lack PPE acute, nursing homes weren’t able let next kin attend patient PPE reserved staff. fine. Sure! meet halfway.

But ey. Firework goes boom OP, *did* take Covid party succeeded come it. 5x higher March/April now.

The deaths coming. huge increase cases weeks now. deaths lag 4-5 weeks. either number cases March/April much, much higher now,

It was. 30k cases back barely testing many cases now, far testing. ... That’s talk show is. Literally every talk show like that.

People watch talk shows hear person talk. Often people, it’s still particular person involved. playbook trump.. who’s passing around garbage GOP politicians? It’s bad playbook. Actually people can't think critically. How? live Monongalia County, W.Va. rarely see anyone wearing masks. Hell, people can’t seem stay least 6 feet apart. hopefully, they’ll start realising important wear mask. Check endowment. poor colleges going miss billions revenue international students.

Of course Harvard Princeton opening campuses person classes. Ugh terrible , horrible way go. May Rest Peace. hope I’m good back cripple. still work bullshit start happening? looking forward getting commercial plane, work purposes, 10 hours. know sound like conspiracy theorist, bats believed source virus live anywhere near wuhan. However, two virus research labs, one specifically used study coronavirus. 

These labs also flagged following safety procedures. Could breakout result wet market? Absolutely. fact remains, know that's came from. We're even certain came bats. 

My money lab two streets wet market source virus. CCP helpful, might never know sure.

Also, something I've noticed happens lot large organizations term work well get stuck people's heads. see companies sometimes new manager executive gets hired brings favorite phrase, something innocuous like, ""Let's touch base"" ""can take offline"" previously common workplace. person powerful personable enough, spread organization, suddenly hundreds people gone dozens years without wanting ""touch base"" take things ""offline"" using terminology.

I found telling TMC published dashboards while, projections turned grim took everything offline convened government. government pushing phased reopening, people probably thinking phase phase weeks. board comes back ""Sustainable Surge Capacity"" ""Unsustainable Surge Capacity"" two terms clear unambiguous, got replaced ""Phase 1 IC"", ""Phase 2 IC"", ""Phase 3 IC."" new terms detached technical, what's difference ""Phase 1"" ""Phase 2"" ""Phase 2"" ""Phase 3"" clear me. tell getting worse, system operate indefinitely Phase 3, quality care go down, triage rules change? I've tried googling around definition terms guidelines, can't find anything publicly available.

It seems instance ""soft language."" George Carlin good bit around   charge Brain Drain. they'd better hurry increase testing excuse. best thing happen this:

2. Trump brags great alonenis responsible fastest vaccine ever.

3. endorsement Trump, anti-science followers get vaccine alongside everyone else.

4. Trump loses election. Thanks reply might've wanted grope Prime Minister's wife. isn’t external force artificially spreading virus there

If Estonia this, precursor EU general do, significant.    sound like stable genius. believe you. Like said, hospitals overwhelmed lockdown. getting now. Every state needs ban travel land, air, sea Florida.

If we're going America's Brazil, need isolated completely. wish virus gets sick dies? don’t grasp reality conversation serving word salad point. Get better argument stop inserting words nonsense people’s mouths make feel better. Build wall
Use ancient magic wathever build gigantic ice wall dont look back  Trump's fault? good die young..... vice versa among ignorant wait, get article via library not? earlier said access article eventually gave text.

If can: that's would expected. It'd bizarre Sweden Nordic country give access citizens. hey never know days. 

And stop lying personal attack. I've actually said I'm European past stop trying call American kind weird insult even line reality. Yeah, Arizona &amp; texted sister last night WE'RE #8! Oh...we're #8...shit. good thing. good thing all. 

I knew country would hit 3 million week. Arizona still climbing list. re-opened soon thanks certain orange person pressuring state leader. slight roll backs, stay home orders. Numbers rise next 2 weeks 4th July parties, hey, we're #8! Yeah mean, (hopefully) see positive changes coming pandemic...more wfh, increased social safety nets, health care improvements, maybe higher minimum wage.

But point (either death rates get low/vaccine/herd immunity/slower transmission) people snap social distancing throw away masks. Americans treated like criminals wearing mask?.

Why countries enforcing wearing masks?. wrong?. know for, accomplish it.

1. slow spread could get handle overwhelm hospitals.
2. dramatically increase testing
3. establish robust contact tracing program, assuming number 1 (manageable level cases)

Most places accomplished half number 1 while, sort number 2 still enough tests, that's it.  equating covid chicken pox, cause they're idiots You’re missing point. longer issue. Many others clearly do. it’s true thing finally stop sort digital self-harm decision stop, others help pushing right direction. makes us.... fucked. still fear.

Oh FYI complete hiring freeze merit increases frozen. many grants awarded? Wow good job high tier publications far! crazy good you.....but get raise like contract said would. See August!? even took Titanic solid form! Deaths doesn’t need to, Trump work point. Biden could probably say absolutely nothing publicly election still win. Cuomo pissing wind expects Trump 2 anything outlived chapo trap house. greatest achievement besides war crimes. would thunk.  Liz ain't going DC. Apparently reading comprehension weakness yours. I’m saying does- impact negligeable a) people less non-protest social interactions b) indoor social interactions people don’t wear masks, crowded keep breathing recycled air (air conditioning also particularly bad) way better propagation outdoor. enthusiastic drinker definitely surpass 655 calories using alcohol delivery systems. That's like 4.5 beers? Easy peasy. Nope. Tenured professors usually absolute worst anyway I've heard greenhouse gas too! dihydrogen monoxide air increases temperature! church needs face stiffer penalty congregation. Taking kids covid party. Fuck outta here, that's child abuse. cancer spread country elected sits throne. Bunch ""good christians"" ass. Bunch brainwashed idiots. Yup, surprising stuff happens over. BYU, university fervently dedicated religion based massive advanced Jewish civilizations ancient America fairly large history &amp; anthropology departments. God knows anybody possibly goes programs still believes religion time graduate... Extreme depression mixed long term anxiety noticed Germany, people use masks stores, mandatory, logic responsible choice.
One foot still store rip masks faces. RemindMe! 5 weeks “this nice person seems know taking about” much trust them? careful distancing masking, wake slight sore throat morning believe call cancel? respectful concerns concerned children's behalf? answer yes, outdoor visit adults wearing masks probably reasonably safe, decide it, need draw boundaries need respect it, i.e. allowed touch hold babies, allowed talk (speaking may produce much droplets coughing according research, masks catch everything). Healthy babies low risk become seriously ill virus low risk mean zero risk. People taking virus seriously know that. family bring safety issue talk want minimize risk children, would refuse based that, tells everything need know potential risk pose. would mimic vaccinated.  Wow. literally said ""a human pandemic intended scrape humans Earth"".

That either implies virus intent there's act intent sort unleashing pandemic. Yep, top 1-5% applicants, rich poor alike. get in, figure make affordable. Ugh, l'm scrambling cover now.  Excuse me, NINETY SEVEN ?!

This catastrophic... That’s shockingly fast. idea could produced quickly. probably young lived anti-seatbelt years US. kid started becoming law wear seatbelt, remember “I’ll please stay away government” attitudes among 1980s US adults.

Looking back, right beginning “right wing” party forsaking science reason political party religion, “infotainment”, emotion based small town Christianity policy.

A culture become particularly heinous needed control pandemic. That’s quite vocabulary Daily deaths US continue fall Wishful thinking reality Taking notes Trump, see. Good you. Lots us actually enjoy spending holidays families though. large majority people currently abusing Asian folks would probably greet people 'white' American

Had read comment, seen preposterous claim Awesome. kid (currently summer) lives st Pete. 

Bout #amberalert motherfucker keep house. 

Jesus Fuck dumb Teachers need strike Florida- schools going engines herd immunity also death traps student teacher comorbidities. Targeted harassment individual users tolerated subreddit.

Still easier keep distance trail bar though. stop pretending religion fucking problem please? accept anything less USA #1 everything. Exactly. rest world smells blood water going wait rather engage further. 

Trump's real strength ability change narrative dominate news cycle, he's completely drowned pandemic. He's trying ignore virus gen culture war statues monuments completely fallen flat.

All Biden needs pop every let people know he's still alive. Damn, almost real leader country. Feel free enlighten crystal ball gauged opinion then. long envision takes? Like were*

why ask specific state list deaths 5 minutes gave 3? saturday holiday, sunday sunday. look every week lag. sit say deaths high were, uptrend again, wait tomorrow Wednesday get accurate picture we're at. What's latest data folks recovered virus? Seems like they're immune? caveats? SD whole could apply disability check case Ok, think mostly agreement point. really know currently - likely fair amount lower overall ratio counts time period testing really bad. 

Interesting conversation, thanks! nice day! Real

Really investigation ... great point certainly radar. possible new strain hit US harder Europe?

Just got delayed. initial announcements ore stock prices anything else. live? sound like live America I'm sure arguing government seem know nothing about.

Gretchen Whitmer, governor state Michigan, called protesters quarantine sorts awful names. called anti-American used word ""killers"".

Is it? groups fell AIDS, blacks. Men could not/cannot come gay practice victims stupid? would argue victims.

Well, yes, point discussion? Gay men are/were forced promiscuity. poor people. Like last year trump taken hospital one evening rush. said start physical? like 3 months ago. Epidemics change time. would madness open everything 3 months ago. done that, we’d probably well second shutdown right now. See Florida example. truWudeauWu No, mean lets say high r0, would need 70% get ""herd immunity"" would take 2 years get there. 

Then, low r0, would need 50%, could also take 2 years get 50% lower R0 means spreading slowly. 

Either way, immunity lasts 1 year, ""herd immunity"" non-vaccinated means even possible. 

I'm obviously making numbers prove point, lower R0 still better many reasons, point lower threshold herd immunity due lower R0 mean geto herd immunity quickly. Using logic wouldn’t want label poutine maple syrup? hockey gear? cover bases? think less, adjust age. stats hand suspect cases last month skewed towards &lt;65 people, whereas back 1Q even distribution cases age. 

Not saying insignificant angle mainstream media missing. Wait, Whut?  Young people spread virus? I'm flabbergasted! Flabbergasted say! grown lab like DeSantos, keep forgetting people parents grandparents.

Oh... France real 3rd world country, avoid costs. deployed phases. starts fall won’t see 2021. similar mortality black plague (1346–1353).

You seriously fucking idea talking about. factor 10.

"" **Mortality** depends type **plague**: Bubonic **plague** fatal 50-70% untreated cases, perhaps 10-15% treated. Septicaemic **plague** almost 100% fatal, perhaps 40% treatment. "" zero measure

They've clear plan distribute it. agreements GAVI others ensure access low medium wealth countries. There's quote somewhere cost fancy cup coffee dose.

I imagine they'll learn lot might help future, financially short-term. really?

pretty sure canada guy pictured blackface ok FUCK means need rather deliberate assessing extent risk transmission via aerosols general matter. 

I agree far many places moving quickly reopen, many places disregarding far less burdensome precautions, doubt take much robust ones based know aerosol risk today.  LEGITIMATE SALVAGE! just....I can't anymore guys. know typically joke say this....but given American citizens government. MD tests staff weekly months. Almost half deaths northeast nursing homes. needed early February. Good point. trying say could even effective people wore properly, trying explain differences countries see. mean I'm doctor, read this, seems like lot nothing. Emphasis mine below.

Asthma Comorbidities

Correct means excuse attempt enter store without wearing mask. thing happened New York City shortage tests meant mostly hospitalized patients serious illnesses got tests. true picture emerge later, though Brazil's situation looks objectively bad right now. Almost everyone catches sick mild symptoms week needing hospital care. immune system generate response time mild cases becomes worse cold. made claims Florida, I'm glad hear they're accurately counting death toll. 

&amp;#x200B;

We need accurate data grapple gravity situation plan accordingly. We're economy built endless consumption. Saving 'help' all. anyone think poor, struggling economy? suffered greatly already! Yes. mask-less photo op followed press conference Trump would rant leftists media, etc.

Trudeau rightly passed brain dead idea. They’re fine. continue go despite eased restrictions expected cases would rise. think one outbreak old age home contained. even BLM protests led rise cases, least photos saw one wearing masks. major differences FL/TX Mass though.

1. reopening bars nightclubs. Full stop. phase 4 phase 4 happen treatment/vaccine exists. one major superspreader venues shut.

2. Mask usage high. everyone wearing mask. definitely wearing improperly, higher mask usage help lot. Mask usage south much lower.

3. Baker's plan already involves taking steps back data calls it. start seeing increase positive % jump numbers, we'll returning phase 2 thing stabilize, phase 2 called for. We'd start seeing small increased massive explosion. FL TX nothing late. could sustainable got really good both! even antibodies disappear while, memory cells primed produce quickly upon potential reinfection major boon too! may require us normalize masks though lot settings though! comes studies showed virus weakened killed temps 75-80 degrees. 

But dumb American asses never thought think studies meant 75-80 degrees *celsius* Actually medical researchers still waiting see effect protests. OUTSIDE. outside instantly lowers risk level- often dramatically. Well, it’s choice. want live virus two, three, four years... that’s choice go ignored want lambux Great explanation, thank says ""The measles virus, example, remain contagious air 2 hours.""

Which means, force air currents miraculously remains air two hours, potentially contagious. 

It mean measles I'm walking sidewalk cough certain location happen walk exact airspace 1 hour 55 minutes later, risk catch it. 

If we're going worried cough likely infect someone two hours later, way avoid would put everyone hermetically sealed rooms. literally means nowhere safe, ever. want go next 6 months two years whatever narrative bouncing around head... you. lay hang-ups rest us.

I'm trying asshole here. I'm trying point inherent risks alive. let paranoia control you, that's sad. It’s reddit TOC advocate political violence + breaks subs rule politics. 

Not fault cannot read rules. got live safely home that. Try fresh college survive shit. needs clear reasonable accommodation still require allowing physical entry location. Example, allowing curb side pickup would satisfy retirement. forceable lockdown like Italy did, could stamp month. Things quiet stay home measures first implemented, people got bored month weather got sunny warm around then. Sigh. Nowadays seems business usual judging cars people. area also freedumb types doubt keep home. older neighbor across street even socially distance. couple months ago came chat gobsmacked didnt stop walking came husband started touching baby cheek. Recently came within three ft husband baby chat. husband polite back say anything try tell stay heck away neighbors cause obvious taking seriously. Husband keeps saying statistically chances getting low drives insane. Older neighbor relative definitely doesn’t believe this, guess person’s poisoning well. neighbors continue socialize also happen super devout Christian. idea attending service, don’t even want know. Oh jesus people... think U.S. right? lot people site think open borders everywhere Businesses employers also ask details disability order provide reasonable fair accommodation. “I can’t wear mask isn’t disability”. Also doesn’t require people get wear mask, businesses accommodations:
*Online order curbside pickup 
*Have staff member shopping
*Wear face shield
*Have person come back certain time accommodate request

If disability can’t expect people accommodate don’t disclose disability is. Also certain things qualify disability ADA. get decent face mask mid-June order put first week April. still able get proper 3M N95 mask amount money. 
Fearful Frugal: Coronavirus Wreaks Havoc America’s Psyche
Covid-19 ushering dramatic shift U.S. shopping habits, one likely seen since Great Depression.

Many malls, like one Tucson, Arizona, reopened, shoppers still aren’t showing up. Americans hesitant go back stores, according recent survey, could long-term shift behavior.

As U.S. reopens, Americans much interested going spending.

A survey 2,200 U.S. adults shows Covid-19 dramatically changed behavior world’s biggest economy, potentially long haul. data flashes warning signs recovery, showing waning interest public events material things, like appliances clothes, new austerity, expressed pantry stockpiling delayed big-ticket purchases.

This foreshadows era fear frugality could push full economic rebound—one Washington Wall Street banking on—out reach. data also raises doubts much rising consumer confidence translate spending, economy heavily relies. survey, polled last weekend, doesn’t account past week spike cases stalled reopenings several states, potentially deepening pandemic’s behavioral impact.


“People generally expressing they'll certain things less, home, own,” said Victoria Sakal, managing director brand intelligence Morning Consult, Bloomberg News’s partner survey taken last weekend June. “There’s also health component safe, comfortable protected people feel.”


Fear Factor
Wary American shoppers say yet ready return mall

Note: Data 2,200 U.S. adults surveyed June 26-28, 2020
Americans—often stereotyped around world confident point arrogance—have developed fear enclosed retail spaces. three-quarters U.S. adults feel okay shopping inside grocery stores small businesses, half don’t feel safe inside shopping center, data show. adding woes malls.

And new preference smaller retailers appears staying power: Even pandemic ends, nearly 30% Americans say plan buy small businesses virus.

“Small businesses built people’s trust,” unlike shopping malls, Sakal said.

It’s malls Americans circumspect. asked social plans economy fully reopens, half said weren’t looking forward going movie theater, sporting event, concert show.

Drinking Home
When stay-at-home orders end, Americans go beer

Source: Morning Consult, Bloomberg
Note: Data 2,200 U.S. adults surveyed June 26-28, 2020
Bars, particular, lost appeal, half U.S. adults even little bit looking forward grabbing beer lockdowns end. apprehension comes amid recent surge cases tied drinkers spreading virus. Around 100 people recently infected four bars Minnesota, another 100 cases linked one watering hole Baton Rouge, Louisiana.


Americans appear less fearful restaurants, even then, roughly two-thirds say they’d feel better eating indoors eatery required employee masks, new kitchen cleaning protocols spaced-out tables.

Diners say they'd feel comfortable eating precautions

Note: Data 2,200 U.S. adults surveyed June 26-28, 2020
These cautious attitudes mark stark change country admired derided at-times extravagant consumer culture. America invented shopping mall movie theater, eight world’s ten biggest sports stadiums. coronavirus lockdowns given rise new attitude: reopen it, might come.

Some hesitance economic. Americans became frugal pandemic, survey shows. past three months, 23% respondents purchased generic items, 28% increased bulk purchases 41% chose save money often forgoing purchase. People also increased price comparing, putting luxury expensive purchases hold higher rate.

Discretionary Items
Nearly four ten Americans skipped clothing purchase save money

Note: Data 2,200 U.S. adults surveyed June 26-28, 2020
This thriftiness could stay, permanently shifting makeup average American consumer—not unlike Great Depression’s impact spending habits 90 years ago. three quarters consumers say expect increase savings rate financial conservatism economies fully reopen.

The survey comes days U.S. government's top infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, announced “disturbing surge” new cases, sparked hotspots Texas, Arizona, Florida California. time, New York neighboring New Jersey, original epicenters disease, second thoughts speed reopenings delayed return indoor dining. Meanwhile, cases young Americans spiked.

Nonetheless, lockdowns fully come end, it’s youngest Americans first door. survey shows 29% Gen Z consumers looking forward returning restaurants, one four getting excited concerts movies—more cohort.

If afford go out, is. study shows comes saving, Gen Z adults, ages 18 24, intent “definitely” frugal pandemic.

That makes sense, according Sakal. “Younger generations likely changed purchasing due Covid,” said. “They've directly impacted job changes, much savings.” Yeah, arresting dipshits going partying knowing they're infected.

Sadly I've heard different things personal friends groups. Many want wear masks scared go might get coughed spit (as happened article). sounds really common form hear, reports back up. 

It probably different place place, though. Hopefully places really 99% people care mask Absolutely. Hell, could use Oxford vaccine buy time maybe fine-tune MRNA approach, like Moderna others working on. put stop pandemic work new technology help us stop next one. Let tell Turing test...

Blammo! feel Trump would courteous?  seen fucking guy say anything tweet anything courteous?

Have states reported weekend, ones?

7 day moving average continues trending down.  Trump: ""Hey u up?""

Trudeau: *Read 2:30* like changed options sustainable unsustainable, phase 1 phase 2 (or 2 3, can't recall). Unsustainable sounds bad, phase 2 sounds like something plan want happen. current spike directly connected protests occurred Memorial Day weekend after. way mathematics work expected.

I complain it. social distance, wear masks, wash hands, etc.... also think young people ones going getting it. likely ok. People risk old need careful. vaccine coming anytime soon. best vaccine 97% effective. Flu vaccine been, times, 10% effective. Better develop medicines let virus burn population. bad economy going kill people.

Also, love peaceful protesting. right needs exercised. violence atrocious, require 20 year jail terms. night day difference two. Free speech get hit face. talk, talk, talk. agree disagree, talk tomorrow. vote.

Why assume thoughts, mind reader? Pretty sure live blood little boys.

You need wear masks.

You need avoid large gatherings.

The actions required regardless testing way many cases bother contact tracing. Testing super important able use something super rampant less useful. 

If anyone cares, month ago. comment replied far off. article saying ~1/3 always wearing masks outside house, ~1/3 wear masks public spaces, ~1/3 wearing masks. definitely underestimated guess, suppose that's I'm region cases low, people wearing masks, case across country(as everyone knows , Texas, Florida, etc.). anyone find precise statistics many people wearing masks US, I'd like know. photo would perfect buddy cop movie poster. aren’t going stop young people going parties/going bars they’re open. aren’t point.

OH wait, people reasonable, nevermind. Well, least vote. everything simple black-and-white right? 

It’s possible 40 maskless cops lined front people screaming top sides shitty cloth masks still might’ve spread something? 

Like use head. basic science. bandwidth testing Italy height pandemic least 5k tests day. 

Still, even populous city Italy conducted around 1/3rd tests Lombardy. never lacked testing capacity certain areas, it’s fewer people dying areas country. weird. vacation? neither, used check subreddit good news wasnt worth it, instead started drawing, writting cooking. Trying learn new things improve skills things enjoy helps make quarentine times shorter. Remember talk loved ones professionals surely try best help you. :) willing go got word trip 3 weeks ago. race fans (SRO social distancing years anyway), pandemic numbers looking okay. last 14 days though...oof.

I'm flying United way there, week later, American way back. I'll let know goes. 

I mask hand sanitizer. feel odd two things two definitive items virus. drive Doordash everything lockdown SLC best. Little traffic, less time waiting people answer door, lot orders. People even tipped better while. chemically burned lunged grateful less air pollution.  Spending much time family, saved 2 hours driving every day, managed put money away, finally completed load house jobs we'd putting years underlying health conditions have???? need fool thinking could happen me.  American thing, think? I'm Europe people know well difference common cold flu. Influenza awful put fit 28-year old bed 2-3 weeks, sometimes more. I've felt like death. people vote, harder steal election.

Also, gerrymandering based certain percentage voters actually voting. Trump says, higher voter turnout would ruin GOP. That's based poll April dude. July. yup, source according article definitely China. would right thing make go bankrupt? They're paying staff definitely significant costs people still ships. They're feeding them, giving medical treatment, additional fuel ship full staff. commented got banned. 
Alex Jones banned too. 
And thought people would fight death freedom speech. \*Cries American\* UK lockdown terms seriousness? know nothing compares China, remember even seeing Italy pictures crazy. US, outside NY CA (maybe even there), really lockdown, business closures. That's bandaid. instead changing society nobody go work sick all? hope true. SOB every single day since late March. really starting get me. used ride bike 20-30 miles. get winded walking hundred feet. Really miss riding. beautiful state, mecca art music writing, one ""worst case scenario"" states, corrupt, low information state government among worst nation.  Wow Tom heart wrenching. I'm sorry loss difficulty able say goodbye get comfort closure mom makes whole process even cruel. Even though happening much right really put perspective. Thank sharing. hope find peace good loving memories her. people trying undermine disease know people start shedding dead virus several weeks. far understanding vaccines go develop antibodies exposed dead virus.

Is possible develop antibodies exosure somebody shedding dead virus cells? Ever heard atomic bomb? yet kills people numbers literally compare wars ecological disasters.

Fuck off. Oh that’s interesting, that’s news mention people suffering terribly don’t die. get counted? aren’t everything power prevent dying suffering surviving destroying lungs rest lives? Right, politics. that’s dumbest thing I’ve ever heard, don’t know is. shit joke. course It’s definitely sad tragic story don’t want take anything story it’s much exception norm. IFR people aged 18-50 around typical seasonal flu. honesty wouldn’t surprised died things rather directly covid, hospital long know ventilators now. might recovered much better take hydroxqurlquine zinc. Rip regardless. Good know, thanks! Well, dying devastating dying FaceTime definitely shitty.  Go out. Elect Dems October it'll taken care of. ""In country, gotta make money first. get money, get power. get power, get women."" God sub stupid af. world war. 9/11. virus. Simply virus. Like flu. Like pneumonia. Like common cold. take preventive measures don’t go outside. choice.

The reason hung death rate don’t lock economy 0.26. worried humans dying mental illnesses, cancer patients can’t get treatments, overdoeses? affects lockdown. know don’t care matter much virus.

Also hospitals country overrun right now. Houston overrun. Florida overrun. California overrun. stop kidding believe news deeper research fear mongering online. thought China could easily said nothing, instead sticking neck out. ever say vaccination would also part effort? course vaccination essential. But, contrast previous years, ALSO social distancing increased awareness. arrogant face monster wondering teeth. exactly right. Please kiss touch many loved ones me. less ignorant, better world be. Funny pro-vaxxers become anti-vaxxers.  

And exact legitimate reason. get upset inconvenience mask, Brunch whatever people think important “right”. son won’t even get know him. wife widow. There’s argument offer can’t worth life someone else. honestly think going say China caused it?! elected government screwed guess really immediate testing much potential side effects long-term. There's big unknown factor get know happens people taken vaccine 6 months, year, 5 years, etc. time like. Certainly appears considering even optimistic timeframes throughout world end year. Even get viable vaccine, way produce enough august. calling people idiots *(comment mine)* ok calling covid....iots....is not? I'm confused. Anyway guess I'll refrain using word here. Also, variety common infections crazy inflammatory responses etc, even common cold, never got much media attention. COVID-19 something worry about, weird shit happens time, like allergic reactions etc. **It's almost funny, anti-vaxxers take super rare cases autism interactions make seem like vaccines everyone.** 


Sorry got downvoted probably too, think lot people assume anti-mask, anti-social distancing etc even question veracity practical chance anyone healthy (including genes) reproducing extreme fringe cases. California. Results vary guess. brother got results 3 days. Hey who's darn testing? We're trying keep numbers getting voted truth hurts Expecting see article Florida Arizona well. I've already started seeing 90%+ capacity articles areas. I'm like want say well said. need guilty pleasure really think stereotypical fan, image invented people prefer make things seem black white order post hoc rationalize feelings simple justification. Much bashing see Reddit ironically tends people idea they're talking about. love listening long form low pressure conversation lets guest expose actually articulate ideas. Nobody know like Joe thinks he's source anything nobody know blindly jumps board guests... guy experts know thing two though vocal subset reddit can't stand people disagree given platform. fascist antifascist crew, often product recent surge neo-Marxist ideology left. Many kids young even recognize they've pulled cult thought hard anybody large platform they're desperate manipulate discourse themselves. They're really not. There's huge misinformation campaign works, many people area even think exists thinks part government conspiracy. external force like almost protestors covering faces with? 

It’s weird conveniently consideration. It’s almost narrative you’re disingenuously trying propagate denying/omitting important pieces information? seems completely reasonable protests could helped bring spikes, we're seeing data show that. NY, many major population centers spikes increases tremendously less AZ, TX, FL, southern CA seeing. Anyone telling dump boyfriend based solely singular incident insanely 

Is boyfriend wrong mentality he’s taking approaching virus? Absolutely. 

Should gotten upset wanting stay party? No. understand upset doesn’t think COVID big deal, yet still took time take home. 

I would strongly recommend draw strong boundary require quarantine 2 weeks see again. 

It’s silly anyone recommend break based 1 incident. It’s relationship. You’ve countless experiences. Presumably good bad. Use judgement. think Texas states might start using stadiums extra COVID-19 space. Man, scary. pictures rows rows beds. stupidity brought us. he's bit racist. Thanks, thought pretty funny. Thank you. can't take bad news level head anymore. Mississippi also noted hookworm various areas.  wife said pre-existing conditions. smoker drinker chance? people see habits underlying conditions absolutely affect health outcome Chinese government knows doesn’t 100% lock media accessible people. Telling world pandemic bad would definitely gotten back country undermined whatever internal propaganda spewing keep population panicking. 

China doesn’t give shit anyone outside country insofar doesn’t impact directly. Lying nature pandemic protect domestic interests expense half million non-Chinese brainer. testing capability abysmal point. bandwidth thousand tests per day, reserved patients sick yet die.

I numerous friends work New Orleans hospitals got slammed March. someone came covid symptoms, they'd swab send off. person died 24 hours later, they'd call cancel test. hundred tests per day, waste time testing dead people. imagine Italy thing. Evidence suggests virus started China (there documented cases prior global outbreak) spread Chinese labourers travelling world.

And information published SARS-COV2 twinkle bats eye.

 Even happens,

China officially talk ""American virus"" would hypocritic months' defence virus politicalized.

The rest west dare offend US.

So, bit deal. I’m going see goes since literally idea expect. haven’t months. like you, I’m prepared quit I’m uncomfortable. It’s tough call since one hiring F&amp;B managers right now. time everyone partied 4th. downvoted you, lose 1000 karma either apparently high 50% asymptomatic possibly higher sars-cov-2. Another US police quitting virus protesters already mask fires saw country level breakdown Covid trends; Brazil India trending even worse (US) are. That's 3 5 populous nations serious trouble. problem irrelevant matter, matter lives.
All China's mandatory city closures, minor treatment hospitals, centralized quarantine, mandatory masks, measures come country's top respiratory, infectious disease, disease prevention control experts.
If sick want live, better listen doctor. Lol, think mods see good news? seen masks beach? haven't, live beach city. several protests went to, people masked. know think find evidence contrary, city perfect, well half protesters masked city, like 90%. 

how drinks get shared parties? close contact maskless, close distance conversations? 

conversations happen protests like beach

then also bare feet, people running around other's loogies, hot dog stands, people sneezing hot dogs beer coolers, etc soforth

Like literally none shit happens beach happens protest

Finally, HARD DATA infections following Memorial Day weekend BLM rallies. 

One way another, infection rate shows gigantic difference. 

Whatever want chalk to, FUCKING MATTER CONTROL LIKE GODDAMN ADULT blah blah blah cut admin bloat. money schools sucked go teachers, tech, labs. went explosion admin staff. Damn, that’s deep takes 20 seconds make mask bandanna couple rubber bands.

Or wear bandanna like mask. Cowboys 200 years ago. Lets use mouths squirt guns!!!! believe cough pneumonia persist body cleared infection caused immune response. read patients ventilators actually longer infectious, they're still sick body's immune response fighting.

Still 8 days seems short. country 14 enforced law. agree, may watch like day. showing symptoms keep someone asymptomatic could possibly spread patients said hospital. thought. I’m going see goes since literally idea expect. like you, I’m prepared quit I’m uncomfortable. It’s tough call since one hiring F&amp;B managers right now. Hey, good old 22 Fillmore still going. :) Amateur. Spray CFCs light fire. Gotta keep ozone layer carbon emissions up! /s Ducey sadly example many upper level officials Arizona. put higher risk straight spreaders orders account sanitizing anything else. Can't wait see statistics many state employees die Ducey friends sociopathic greedy fucktards. Someone dear fighting trying survive hearing orders state gave tells hell lot dead people Ducey opening way soon requiring proper protection. ok felt tsa it’s infringement freedoms wear piece cloth?

the freedom crowd travel air. Nice! area live in? Paramount, Bellflower, Norwalk area barely saw masks all. I’m glad voted her. what's crossed mind recently, too. Obviously, feels extreme like something one needs get used to, infection still occur person's home, especially living people. knows wind carrying. I've opened windows home create type ventilation worry that. pandemic gets control, really matter time become infected, unfortunately. ""Yeah, Black Strippers Lives Matter proteset"" mask social distancing could reduced surge. Ffs nice UK join US phase! border line that’s body. 

What's stance abortion? imagine. would still shell shocked you. liked politicians told Trudeau release Mrs. Huawei get two Canadians China released Trudeau said absolutely not.


He seems able recognize moment leadership attempts respond responsibly. I'm sure he's far perfect seems like he's trying. know....I mean surely president ""the healthiest ever hold office,"" doctor said.

They tell us want. never full story. Stop breaking sub roles fucking donkey ""I think, Mr.Fox, phonecall suffice"" saying Rick Astley let down? might gotten covid hospital think friends lying me, think people writing groups making things up, thin reports media making things up. Thanks! basis that? It’s double edged sword You,re* Everyone says he's getting plasma injections recovered children concentration camps. know, everyone saying it. prefer speaks. forefront trying get fools right things YEARS! Last thing want silence sane. Perhaps. Johnson made big deal still meeting people without masks shaking hands every day - got it. Trump never that. seems like Johnson might bigger dunce here, Trump always understood bad response entirely cynical (and also stupid) political calculation wins dividing, easy way divide people. 

Charles, knows happened there? trying hard enough / taking seriously enough. Johnson indication, latter. 

Yes, saying given evidence, least early on, seems like Trump least handlers took coronavirus much seriously - purely personal level - British leadership/royals. Rona Pandy... think sat next outdoor concert once. racist nazi 

Don’t mind testing words acceptable moderators What's context that? Right wing Canadians HATE Trudeau, even left wing Americans hate Prez.

I vote guy problems governs, bile see social media people vote **actually** insane. 

You'd think Trudeau literally went every single person's house slept mother, wife, sister front people talk him. understanding aerosolization means spread air without droplets thus stay air longer. Whether spread droplets (that fall ground relatively quickly) never contention since early stages pandemic. fine later. stats disprove that? [this quote end JID truth major difference culture ex slave owners living minorities among oppressed allow guns. shitbags running mouth off. heard yanks propose nuking middle east. police differ. gonna say. seems like get stuck dinner plans trashy couple hate. hand mention one stayed home work sick today like ""oh man wouldnt wanna risk it, soooo sorry really looking forward it."" point needed it. still 10% population needs insurance. would people could imagine needing $400k health insurance (there others well insured would high pocket would capped well $400k). likelihood group extremely low.

Like stated, going conversation want be, let us least honest one. Reddit makes everyone needs medical care bills hundreds thousands. true. stated system broken needs improvement, case rather skeptical needed $400k medical bills everyone too. fun Maga rally. succeed america great now? Naw, proactive that. blow away wind God.   Glad 800k deaths simply political fodder. Hell theoretical deaths. 132.5k American deaths. far. job? frustrates many people refuse take seriously. work event weekend hotel 4th July. county, city, resort mandatory mask policies, yet people attending 4th wearing masks. ban events greater 50 people. hotel 600 rooms sold weekend, yet even consider canceling. 

It absolute farce one follows rules enforcement. Expect spike cases 4th July. hope kept distance enough event. Really hard maskless people walk within 3 feet ask question look shocked take step back them. Yes, think need specific data people disorders affected. wouldn’t surprised outcomes worse, also wouldn’t surprised kind seemingly paradoxical protective effect degree. ...that never goes away. thought went protest can't get it, explanation racist.  mean takes test time hes old man hes leading usa 4 years go unlike guy are. Also could dementia. something going on, sure. 74 years old man, surprised even walks straight considering he's much exerciser. Oh, meant *next* Easter mischief managed really believe Covid survived would never hear end it. “Strong genes!” lot mistakes easily identifiable Gypsies trash vaccines.

I cautious take one rushed market. ""Canadians favour complete idiots running country "" 

What Trump anything? I'm American, I'm Canadian, care Trump. agree favour electing idiots, seem continue elect anyways. think Trudeau idiot exclusively purpose running country. agree pushing ideology evidence buying votes like believe doing. hypocrite highest order, matter handsome likeable is, nothing whether good ruler; isn't. Leaders ousted, voted out, impeached. 

But can’t advocate violence sitting members government reddit. 

The reason rule exists good - everyone could talk wanted inflict harm world leaders, sub, probably website would shut down. 

Please read rules. mods work hard make sure reddit breaking rules get caught. also talking right now. one knows reopen due burden infection remaining high. 

As tourist, would think people would want avoid place Europe highest burden infection really thinking much regional differences. know pay go Sweden right now, would happily go Nordic country. Ah, see. worked FL would staff slam ICU 3:1, cause fuck you. Also, put HIV virus, clear evidence admit it.I get link want. 

Read tell think think gist is, can't escape indoors (unless room really big). consider viral load. Time essence here.

Imagine walk grocery store mask 15 minutes. let's assume infectious person well. get low viral load, likely infectious you.

Working together infectious person 8 hours small office makes high viral load.

This bars, protests caused US surge. Outside, mask, never together people long save(ish). Yeah difference real life dies, dies. - Drago could case. main point 40000 new cases 200 new deaths mean disease less deadly. new deaths comparable number cases first diagnosed little new cases.
  
Plus, high numbers new cases low number deaths could also indicate huge rise cases given fact deaths lag cases. He'd acknowledge he'd done bad job. He's mentally incapable anything puts bad light. reason WH denying interview requests Dr. Fauci, would paint fragile President bad light. Tuition= price bunch services u can’t use guess im one 33% . honestly would happy lasted ... well forever. vast majority Americans right thing, right thing interesting enough go viral. spend much time watching Trump. Health care service here, business, unfortunately. Trump clueless, he'll try sign executive order forcing Trudeau come. study virus said get 10 meters airborne spread - would additional 2-4 feet significant enough additional coverage? Yep, loved one hospital reason *besides* COVID-19 *still* can't visit them. Everybody locked out. Happened father April. never COVID-19 (tested twice) still visit confirmed actively dying.  Don’t move kids around, teachers move. Lunch classrooms, assemblies, outdoor gym class etc. things done limit interactions. almost like large group people many experiences large swath people come conclusion. Hmm...

Really makes think. Describe specific reporting issue(s). justifying racism based anecdotes? I’m 51, married working home. Lockdown wonderful even virus terrifying (if either wife get it, we’re probably dead).

Also, work large company we’ve surveys research see people dealing working home, stress, etc.

More half HAPPIER now. Close 2/3 want ever go back office. ones stressed extroverts people young kids (some describe existence “hellish”). use public restrooms look gas stations/restaurants vs unmanned reststops. Gas stations/restaurants clean restrooms depending passing try stick brand gas station (Loves, Casey's, QuickTrip brands trust traveling). layout gas station mostly get fast. fair chance right 1% claim then... Gotta get money ammirite? mom works nursing home North Carolina. Two staff tested positive week half ago. didn’t test staff another five days. getting around testing residents today It’s matter time tests positive. bed Satan That’s honestly great question. opposition leaders suck ass.

I would prefer someone would stood towards rail blockades, used N.S. Shootings political agenda, let word electoral reform stand ground China. Address money laundering affects real estate.

The SNC Lavalin affair blackface incident little disappointing, lot companies corrupt don’t believe ever racist apology alright.  Hey guy family man Two things...the ages infected dropped risk death less still hospitalized. 

Second deaths lag 2-3 weeks behind. Hospitals certain hot spots starting see ICUs fill up. People usually vents 21 days. deaths start increase soon. Yes, admit, hearing lot common sense coming NDP lately. might right. Misleading headline guess. read article headline blatantly bogus. Trump years ago. Covid exacerbated problem alternatively could suggest true herd immunity requires much lower threshold previously thought.

Remember, 1-(1/r) formula assumes full native susceptibility literally zero behavior change. neither conditions occur real life Sounds like kinda guy!

RIP father condolences.  pretty sure authors study would say cloth masks basically ineffective talking about, small, aerosolized particles. small particle size leads traveling large distances remaining suspended, also leads virtually penatrating weave standard cloth mask.

The question always largely size particles giving transmission? fact cloth masks seem measurable effect indicates probably larger particles, don’t stay suspended don’t travel far. Stay safe curly king, he's perfect he's best right now. Hospitals capacity management plans adjust needed. F/e, Palm Beach media reported 80% capacity one hospitals. First, report inaccurate second plan shift admissions area hospitals.

2-3 weeks ago told hospitals would overrun hasn’t happened.

The media creates mass hysteria nearly everyone falls it. 

Name single situation someone hasn’t access hospital bed. haters.. god.. guys gonna hate next 4 years.. need accept hero toss biden. Dead guy can’t use shoes! He’s utilizing resources emergency. Interesting. virus hits everybody differently, although know delayed symptoms common. 

I got two months ago. fever two nights consistent cough couple weeks, although cough non-existent cough drop. I'm 100% now. I'm 19 asthma. 

I'm trying argue anything this, interesting.

Edit: weird little fun fact I'll throw in. I'm nursing student I'll freely admit know research, although I've two professors mention believe getting sick infrequently actually weaken immune system. 

Just thought relevant relates sick 5-6 years suddenly getting hammered this. 

I sources, know shit. know professors said. So, take grain salt. problem protesting, however protections protesters receiving little ridiculous. New York State, allowed ask someone attending protest attempting contact trace people. ridiculous me. decide going shame people believe cause worth fighting safe enough fine. literally scared even ask question risk people losing lives stupid me. Pandemic big enough reason thrown kind crap window afraid scrutiny. New York State done great job time also getting pass lot things. Cuomo mandating nursing homes take COVID patients probably increased death count least 25% getting pass that. would work home possible even sniffles. know everyone luxury, really need normalise distancing degree illness. Trump wants get everyone sick 😷 Elected officials ones rushed reopen! Wonder demonstrators fighting right hair cut doing. there's creditor garnishing tax returns (especially student loan institution) get refund day file. ‘Murica hey wait minute.... countries leader downplayed severity virus,activity discouraged social distancing, encouraged people “liberate state carried weapons lockdown protests?

It’s US “in line” countries policy doesn’t mean people actually it. embarrassing, really turned country joke Nope. Governor said beaches going close lot pretty big crowds.  Another excellent analysis. I'm keeping copies posts handy reference able express thinking able put words. Thanks! I'd never heard ended checking every wondering getting on. thought pulling through. sad news. RIP. dont know opening bars problem USA. works fine Germany illness classic features covid-19 went around area too, everyone got it. around late December middle February estimate.

I it. every covid-19 symptom think of, pneumonia, loss taste smell, fever, diarrhea, etc. almost certain already it, want take chances, took IgG antibody test Quest. came back negative. So, sure covid-19 exposure without testing. Man, really wanted test say previously exposed. let hard results. Right , ""a lot mask enforcement ""

&amp;#x200B;

I never seen kind mask enforcement. happened South Korea 2 months ago we’re still trying stamp spread. could even get laid! imagine that..? No, stops eating. silver lining guess died getting lung transplant would suck gave pair lungs died anyways abd someone else wouldmt get them. Afaik relating blood clotting ? Cant recall exact reason. Yay :) Could get five placements worse. Australia did. suppressed initial growth AKA first wave came lockdown started see new community transmission AKA second wave.

I mean, agree thing barely gotten started Australia's perspective suppressed first wave. First thing came mind big part reason death rate low hospital workers working extremely hard putting asses line.

We everything take pressure them, limited resource, means everything prevent spread virus. That's fear mongering, that's strategic sense, top right thing morally them. Oh god, UMich got smart enough deal properly... right?... please say yes. Tbf seems many countries thought got first wave relatively unscrached really experiencing it. Right? gofundme make sick number new cases hovering around zero, restaurants bars packed people without protection social distancing. Many people become overly complacent.

This going new norm, basic strategy play wach-a-mole game vaccine achieves herd immunity.

You see cluster, shut part city contact trace.

My parent goes walks outside Suzhou alot, say wearing mask anymore there. appeal people want structured trip want travel themselves. hate I’m standing line people inch closer closer. It’s irritating. feel like I’m going wig someone someday. Yeah doctor gave allergy medicine never allergies I'm going try see helps Gaming 8 hours day literally wasting time. Nothing wrong spending time idle entertainment ideally things well Awwww broken health care. well said. searching right words nailed ""..it somehow diminished face bravery patriotism..."" reasons cannot understand, people really think virus changes nature based determination stand it. still virus always virus. better yet, go vacation. tourism industry destroying environment destroying towns cities around world. entire country needs listen Trump. think so. maths, want develop herd immunity controlled way ( ie never many cases hospitals overwhelmed) process take years require ongoing social distancing. simple result fact 10_15 % people need hospital treatment length stay 1-2 weeks, cases increase rapidly soon restrictions lifted 
The way achieve rapid herd immunity ( less year) acceptance mass preventable casualties due hospital failure. soon industrialised nation actually understands this, eg Italy, Spain, New York,Sweden, rapidly pull back brink unacceptable voters sacrifice parents grandparents.
This pattern see again, underlying maths simple, depressing irrefutable.
Different matter poor country limited choices- either properly get go, like Vietnam, crash burn like Iran. ""could"" Lol people said 2020 2019. Mine busy posting picture crowded beach, vacation COVID hotspots bragging cheap flights, risky situations WITHOUT mask. *laughs bitterly Chinese, knowing people continue commit hate crimes us anyway*  Yes places still paying office multi year contracts. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Shows ignorant India's broken healthcare system. dealing stress 40+ hr / week office job ran delusional boomers? check

Lockdown / quarantine fucking amazing whilst 2020 collective year shitshow probably brightest long time. Yup. looked cdc data they've 7k pneumonia covid deaths Feb June. Last year 1.1k pneumonia deaths Feb June. Total 6k extra death official count sits 3.7k right now. Guess u hide it, one know. point. 

Looking John Hopkins 5 day average, we’ve previous peak consistently since June 24th. Seems likely seen 27 days straight increases. Hitting new records 11 days. 

That’s still really bad. yes, shitty reporting. Misleading headline. source. stay winning, Floriduh. People see civil disobedience save lives conclude engage civil disobedience put lives risk like people learn man walked moon want know haven’t walked sun. Nah , lied Archer trades Learn exponential growth works. India 1.3 billion people. one force pay debt. Sure call harass can’t force you. sue you’ve got nothing still won’t get anything. Well blood pudding something eat.

Pudding blood eats you. Thank good person. know, losing Tom would borderline national tragedy. Fauci lied. many people died?

Misunderstanding Fauci said lying. clear get-go. Idiots would drive past hospital's ER screaming valet attendants they're hiding real numbers virus real. group young adults times obstructed traffic minutes time, demanding ""tell truth public.""

The result wealthy OC socialites keeping blood lines little pure, clearly. education fail fail education? Either way that's whole lot nonsensical BS drive Sweden Norway. Swedish Russian borders still closed though. worries made edit. Great News! happen Stockholm days ago well. I'm obama. Head sino chat lads Chinese. Aussie police always armed, that's irrelevant.

Second, Australian news Premier grilled press several times. obviously there's concern it. Insignificant change. I'm avoiding Dentist. know go, seems stupid expose someone mouth propped open hover tooth ache. said thing may around 4 years  friend grew Michigan still family can't stand Whitmer acknowledge leadership contributed improving situation. political her. 

*sigh* Whether cruise ships survive crisis without bankruptcy still huge question mark. They'll cut costs wherever can. Seriously. guy apparently thinks virus would lie dormant planet, activate within months everywhere? 

That would AMAZING bioterror weapon, honestly.. especially conditions activate could triggered somehow targeted way.

But would trigger activation “dormant” virus entire planet like that? get he’s saying temperature trigger would explain meat packing plants significant case loads.... doesn’t really explain rest cases we’re seeing activating people don’t work cool environment. Fat put options opinion

Why feel opinions make valid base forming public policy? agree man. don’t think widespread immunity yet. best guess 5% population immune. remember though, people don’t make antibodies could contribute higher immunity number marginally. Something tells another shutdown coming lot places long overtime lower commute time, would worry I'm planning it, thanks. Totally right. looked page day marveled wide range countries list successes. day age America banned travel list absolute disgrace. wall serve another purpose: keep us away rest world. ""elected officials"" burying lot voters. saw stayed. Die economy. think mean blood pudding. Also yes. literally seen massive blood clots heart lungs. Like holy fuck massive. Yep, danger milestone announcements give feeling ""it's easy downhill skiing on"". Nope. work continue. give leash virus, immediately capture space give it. vigilant attitude carried end. I've working more, partner enjoying semi/lock-down working home reduced hours. visibly happier, started hobbies (pickle making, playing guitar), time socialise... still got work done. happy (and little jealous honest).  
It's depressing go back daily grind office... really want us chained desks. country like China weaponized viruses bring countries inside, keep vaccines themselves? shower thought question. It’s funny, say don’t go hospital unless it’s emergency, given none us reference “emergency” comes COVID-19, confusing! able breathe sounds like emergency! China must new plans nothing else. Coronavirus China’s strategy weaken countries' economies. 1.4 ? thought would higher. 1.x look bad $250 enough. Louis Bossi's brought DJ turned restaurant packed nightclub long line people waiting get in. literally said fuck regulations place $250 fine? “Fake news, fake news” Brings new meaning phrase 'Better dead red'.  soon show decreasing numbers, bars open up! yay. seems least demands serious talk working together make things better: person, lover, member society. understand love him, seems needs assume bit responsibility. Reddit quite dramatic one sided. sound like reasonable accommodations given circumstances. interesting. reporting recent? googling could find anything. Texas still (June July) reporting pneumonia deaths? can't believe numbers, seem going Germany route looking reporting blow lid story. get rid American Machismo. really want get antibody test since something similar New Years (came visit family Chicago area). Full Pneumonia, unbearable cough, completely incapacitated two weeks. feel like normal flu general feeling something incredibly wrong sickness really scared crap me. 

Keep mind December peak influenza season surprise far widespread gap months Chinese suppression virus actually began start limited testing. I'd actually gotten break work, may amazing, balancing work home small child exhausted stressed ever been. Big Gretch! Much respect Gov... really? live smaller town really many peoples still wear mask. still write aame sanitize enter shops Austin lot less progressive they've convinced country are. 

For record, felt safer visibly queer Houston Austin. even realize I'd spent 2+ years constant threat assessment public travelled outside Texas boyfriend. confusing field hospitals hospital surge capacity. Texas Medical Center Houston using surge capacity. surge capacity comes converting additional sections handle ICU patients. requires equipment, staffing, proper prevent virus spread area. one I’ve established another pod icu patients. Made almost every regular nursing floor covid unit. also hemorrhages staff you’d likely 1:6 icu 6 vented patients. think keeping changing drips (lowest amount one patient tended 5) would could do; let alone make patient’s room change them, turn them, clean them. They’d probably get turned prone stay way rot due lack staff flip supine. K much it? 🙄 Call cynical, trust good news Mariña.

""La Marina"" sounds like somewhere Costa Blanca. Yap, complicated. *plays Pirates Caribbean main theme* People shat open Michigan protesters like gonna spread virus guess one talking huh Bio fucking terrorism. That's knowing spreading much possible. prior peak New York collapsing bringing rest New England them. time, NYC basically testing severe cases, positivity ratio extremely high, like 40% more. Now, tests picking way people mild symptoms way young people unlikely die. 

Also, New York New Jersey deliberately sent coronavirus patients nursing homes (NY even barred testing incoming patients), resulted significantly higher deaths one would expect states deliberately expose vulnerable people virus. Assuming states manage avoid following disastrous NY model, deaths remain lower NY. Although they're surely going increase today. Far it. basically saying injected vaccine got sort immune response. Whether protective not, long last, information. Still miles go. Religion/tradition probably. Like Chinese grind kinds exotic crap ineffective medicine ailments, treat/cure effectively proven medicine. sit without masks Damn. fought hard, wish things could ended differently. biggest threat way life stupidity! study proudly brought CCP Reddit. CANNOT UNDERSTAND GOVERNOR ENFORCE MAKS! many countries Europe sick leave limited amount - depends whether sick judged doctor countries falling apart lack manpower.The reason already way much manpower way little actually society can't live without. I’m saying it’s disingenuous suggest virus cause long term permanent damage large swath asymptomatic carriers

I literally never said that. reading toilet, shot shit one swift machine gun burst got ooga booga. Thank fair; COVID-19 complications serious WAY fringe. rarely ever gets serious. likely guy type pre-existing condition worsened infection. may immunocompromised known it.

I think people start renewing fears COVID-19, need keep mind global fatality rate something ballpark 540 000 people...out 7 billion. (As post)

It sucks die, REALLY unlucky. didn’t reply it’s 7 whole minutes. I’m saying isn’t concerning. I’m saying it’s disingenuous suggest virus cause long term permanent damage large swath asymptomatic carriers even articles cherry picked anyone suggest could case beyond gratuitous “uh yeah, never know!”. trust pulmonologist NPR interviews radiology today whatever shit managed dig up. time cant stop thinking "" Let die"" hoping nuew plaque anyway weed dumb people exaclty covid . problem people love die dont want .

Oh right. never Marxists bulshit. 

Oops. Sorry reddit garbage. That's link, article text. FYI, 'agenda' see downtrend deaths continue. use 27 days worth rolling averages would actually indicate I'm correct use shorter term data based overall trend change started 3 weeks ago.

Interesting. Yes, Anthony Fauci's nickname China American Zhongnanshan.

Likewise, called Zhongnanshan Anthony Fauci China. People infected asked generic questions think may contracted virus from.

So far, [there hasn’t increase attributed It’s like thousands protesters gotten infected decided lie attending parties going bars cover story. None. thoughts moment.

How certain totally isolated? “If stop testing right now, we'd cases, any” I'm atheist myself, try crack ""your God real"" crap someone grieving pain would make a-hole.

It’s reason Americans insist going around shooting people. demand right guns. Nobody tell otherwise. principle masks. It’s right wear one. Screw everybody else. Uh, seem like it'd work. sort practical joke? outcome fight SARS might without academician Zhong Nanshan. (Senior Chinese leader Zhang Dejiang)

(Reviewed Guangzhou Daily) Ah, Chinese said 'No'. There's surprise. 😷 im still laughing fact Dem voters rejected Sanders &amp; Warren......and chose ONE candidate resembles Donald

like, damn yo. went school guy elementary school. shut everything everyone locked home vaccine 2025. leg amputated? Covid-related? though? 🤔🤔 Connecticut also number three US coronavirus deaths per million (numbers 1 2 are, course, New Jersey New York wide margin). Massachusetts seems per capita coronavirus deaths Connecticut. Still way higher US average (about 1,200 per million vs 400 per million) though. Anyhow, non-coronavirus deaths must compensate. America destroyed hubris. much worrying external enemies easily brought inside. happend butchery. soo sad. 1956, Zhong Nanshan, third year college, excelled sports member Beijing Medical College (now Peking University College Medicine) athlete represented Beijing University Games, took crown 400-meter run. day, Peking University College Medicine several unbroken athletic records set Zhong Nanshan.

In 1958, Zhong Nanshan transferred Beijing training team train first China National Games.

In August 1958, competition test first China National Games, Zhong Nanshan broke national record 54.6 seconds 400m hurdles time 54.2 seconds. No, China ""totalitarian"" like East Germany, North Korea, Soviet Russia. China little interest managing controlling every aspect peoples lives. China properly termed ""authoritarian"", one-party state commands absolute political power.

The oddity Western political scientists trouble fact China competent governing. Chinese government derives legitimacy virtue governing well. Chinese people trust government act behalf, right now, cooperation people matters, reap rewards communal sacrifice. 

Also, China advised Italy Spain properly implement lockdown. That's numbers eventually went rapidly. Europe reasonable amount sick leave, use cold fever (and happens least two times every year). would gladly wear mask protect coworkers, hope would same. Ca confirm.

My dad due get routine screening cancer. remission since five years supposed get tested every 6 months.
We already late four months unfortunately feels like it’s gonna get dragged year cases India spiking exponentially. First all, “common cold” caused dozens (hundreds?) different viruses.

Secondly, vaccines without side effects. risk/benefit analysis one.

For example, born, BCG tuberculosis vaccine part standard regimen country. longer case, prevalence tuberculosis longer justify risks associated vaccine.

For measles tetanus vaccine’s risk orders magnitude smaller posed disease, routinely given.  Indoor dining bars never opened back up. Wishing swift recovery, fuck man, nipped town (rural U.K.) People smirking wearing mask, others wearing masks knew gave nod. It’s weird there. I'm beginning realize life human nature, general, remembered might better remembered freaking idiot. within right choose goes body.

Americans apparently problems understanding ""muh rights"" end others rights begin. comments embody self centered focus core problem. inability care others, 70 health problem (as mention), casts disturbing get rid parts society, problem, yours. theyre selfish morons deserve eliminated gene pool 

I already did. asymptomatic cases mild lung inflammation signs illness, pulmonologists say they're likely kick infection quickly see lasting lung damage.
 suspect that, followed asymptomatic people several months, CT scans would completely normal unless known later develop symptoms,"" Taylor-Cousar says.

I’ll follow more. projecting actions onto me. incredibly disingenuous risks even presented additional data additional cause concern.

There *multiple* different groups tested abnormalities across multiple studies. clearly even read articles.

To respond edit, cherry-picking articles linked. literally concerning enough looked more. trying make seem less harmful potentially accusing sensationalizing? There's point time presented entertaining.

You see dates those? new thing. want proof? I'm sure plenty future studies. case realized, we've literally never dealt we're constantly learning new things. I'm simply speculating there's room release mild cases, see reply original dialogue   41....fuck young. medical issues?  Huh, TIL. correct then. Take responsibility step down. Still arguing wearing masks, make stupidity up! Leaders free world leaders loony bin? Ok doesn’t appear anywhere link cited. 

Also, someone shot head neck chest evidence “CIA execution”? pretty damn flimsy even conspiracy theorist standards. mean gonna kill someone that’s I’d aim too. sued oblivion revealing someone’s health data. individual owns health data controls access. employer disclose theirs. Technically speaking course. Get fucked quit job. course you’re “lecturer” professor, you’re probably barely employed yourself. Looks like COVID-19 way seasonal illness. think people expecting vaccine end all. one know decried U.S. World 1st class public healthcare system virus particle supposedly smaller 0.3um. That's within range odour particles. course fucking airborne lol. Chinese doctors said virus particles hitch rides dust particles such. know this. Parts legs arms permanently numb.... fuck literally sold American soldiers improve personal relationship Putin.

This help America all, Trump. was...but seeing user name makes better lmao! cavalier way talk throwing people jail disturbing. median age dropped 65 35 massive effect infection frequency *and* asymptomatic positives.

I'm curious, agenda think I'm pushing? anything gain sensationalizing misleading people. Fuck off. India less 100,000 ICU beds population 1.3 billion. People dying without access beds hospitals. Heck, even hospitals people left die, doctors/nurses lack PPE refuse touch patients. woman left hospital bathroom decompose. 

Get covid19 induced heart attack? left die, one come airlift nearest hospital. still access testing town. fuck insane comments. think cases, normalizing per capita preferred/more informative, no?  map best unintentionally misleading using landmass visualization scale. worst actively deceptive. 

Example:
 
**Montreal total cases:** 27,428, displayed map all

**Toronto total cases:** 14,270, displayed map all

---

**Vermont, US total cases:** 1,249, entirely red map

**NH, US total cases:** 5,897, 80%+ red map

**Maine, US total cases:** 3,415, 40+% red map

---

Toronto 3,000+ cases 3 state US listed. Montreal double. cities red all. I'm sure similar things examples could found along border.

New York blows Quebec water 400k+ vs ~55,000 point map show that. 

Canada keep border closed map shows us nothing. good! figured case commented hoping help clear miscommunication. title article really misleading terms misrepresenting expert confusing issue. hope honest mistake writer

Edited: realize title direct reflection original article, worded op ""you're i'm white! i'm rich! i'm jewish!""

no happening delusional possibly danger others. even know angry internet stranger point. app lets reply via Android notification hear lot available beds Texas, close capacity regards healthcare staff? Look RED AZ! Taiwanese call useful information ignore don’t even acknowledge existence nation. Problem antibodies dissapear quickly sometimes, even immunity there.

Also, test antibodies meant skew toward false negative(if remember correctly)

So, could higher might well lower now, actually. mean much. guy keeps saying asinine statements. bunch consensual adults make decisions themselves. Neither parents grandparents senile. place tell them, can't see grandkid. know risks. smart people. people different risk tolerance you, might find risks worth taking.

RE long term, nana ""long term"", anyway. spat coffee. far COVID concerned, folks prison issued death sentence. feel badly situation. justice system repopulate prison fresh batch non violent drug offenders. Essentially shake poor people minorities. people immune virus, ebola virulence list. pathogen ever going infect 100% even get close. come from? Sometimes plea agreements innocent alternative life path even worse. might give 3 years (including time served point) plea threaten 40+ lose trial. Public defenders can't help every person represent much dedicated defense team would, people take losses take plea see way jury would believe them. truly unhelpful comment supplement somewhat helpful comment: 


Decimate means reduce something 1/10. US economy, word looking ""Annihilated"" funny real sow, good let virus flow you. Really shit thought *coincidence* thats swaths population dying pneumonia influenza stroke year. like ""what could cause this? COVID19 that's hoax could be?"" Probably likely 10 1 March April, we'd much closer 1 1 right overall hospitalizations deaths much lower percentage. A.K.A, easier get tested right now. fake numbers

1500 normally die Feb

2000 died Feb 

=500 excess deaths

Of 500 excess deaths 

325 COVID cases = 65%

175 don’t know = 35% barring unethical challenge trials can't prove it. Thank you. looking exactly this. Yeah, read article locale said candidates ECMO beds already Texas shit ramping up. electoral college shut due representatives coming ""the hoax"". Trump lose way lost businesses. mentally ill, that's base talking about. Hard vote mental ward. like idea. High unemployment + high need child care = perfect jobs program (just remember background checks!)  What’s consensus taking ibuprofen? haven’t taken months early cases thought link severity taken ibuprofen. stopped taking case get it. much prefer acetaminophen curious could go back ibuprofen. limited re-research shows found true problem. what’s consensus here? yuri's cloning vats basement churn French French. International media dont report ""usual"" North African hoodlums \*\*\*\*\* us French people decades (90% street crime). Pardon medical naiveté, someone help harmonize ""Interestingly, none children reported respiratory symptoms, despite testing positive coronavirus antibodies it"" ""In study, four children needed intensive care developing shock placed mechanical ventilation?"" basically, zero risk all.

Police incredibly safe job. Police almost never get killed job. fantastic PR times cop actually gets killed. 'man bites dog' kind thing.

Also, cops would obey law wear fucking masks, they'd fine, too. I'm optimistic.

The majority new cases younger, healthier people much higher survival rate....so hospitalization length stay half was. Yes, hospitals crowded, that’s mainly due re-installation medical care non COVID-19 patients. 
Yes, infections, can't stop that. focus protecting people going serious complications. think anybody thinks US *right*.

What many people site believe US useless, expensive build, expensive maintain, expensive staff, that, based history current administration, either never finished handed evil officials hire.

In case pandemic, course, priorities change. Really? info optimistic Oxford scientists Dr. Fauci have? seem think pretty likely. brutality videos protests already alarming number unmasked police absolutely would taking back "" brothers sisters blue"" wanted badass display full affect really baffled .

I'm sure online education grow improve exponentially, can't imagine gap students who're able go person schools attend labs/practicals otherwise get hands practice things vs. students everything virtually.  huge swaths death?

Less consumers, all.  Damn, make really good points. Sounds like hurting constantly exposing sort information online. Unsubscribe option. employers ill informed, show study ""Were 206447 cases, soon zero."" everybody knew study Sweden refuses admit study.

No comment. correction: prisoners got railroaded plea agreements able breed many specialists staff though? German bloke living Ireland. English tends towards Hiberno English British English... Nice Trudeau Covid handy excuse. many leaders world would want hang orange POS. Makes easier get obligatory visit. sounds like situation pandemic true cause feelings you’re trying pin blame people discussing it. much value claim asymptomatic spread rare, currently shared around enemies 'conspiracists'. see 2nd 3rd worlders get stuck with! Right? Pandemics happen happened, contingency planning advance large universities. many impacts coronavirus, massive amounts students held back educations fall cracks. That's encouraging. seem confident vaccine candidate. Singapore 

They comprehensive contact tracing, testing, regularly wear masks.

Singapore 7,000 cases per million (the us 9,000 cases per million). accused Gypsies responsible. we're telling you, want safe, stay far away people. Get mom pulse oximeter! may show oxygen low notices. It’s shame fifty states can’t form sort single, united entity. Like something fifty states. What? warned us years ago Thats fucked up. 
Wonder much money private jails cough get happen.  one truth managing crisis magnitude. Again, lie, rather made recommendations based assessment best interest public. correct yes am. 9 years sober past April I’m extremely thankful. change fact I'm born, I'm Sámi stop guys racist family. 
So screw you. wrong meaning hope see trend fall cases Wut..? Okay, seems definite opinion. Heath departements Scandinavian kingdoms must totally wrong. Stay safe! Okay....like, normal person normal reaction virus carried life?

Who cares? covid-19, weeks biggest shit life. posted? Minor nitpick: Trudeau head government. head state Queen, she’s present, Head State Governor General, currently retired astronaut Julie Payette. Watching news gave impression too, living US talking friends family home daily, could see despite heard news, lives pretty much could could different points time. course state state varies. knows many people infected drunken stupidity?

If can, drive least week make sure battery die keep wheels rotating. sits long tires flatten, loss air actual deformation. You’re going stop players getting even sports. least organized sports hopefully help provide bubble constant testing. you’re literally making things up. I’m exempt wearing mask “reasons” probably means airborne. also recall debate corona subs start year fairly obviously airborne based information getting. split people airborne people thought droplets though, like consensus issue. Evidence suggesting airborne old news though. India inevitably get worse. always take every calamity extremes fucked hard creating billion + people governed racist caste system. get lot worse. viciously attacked truth, officer... 2020 isnt freak nature unlucky shit, foreseeable results years foing stupid shit. Forcing people closer exotic animals little oversight way. poorly controlling efforts fixing it.

 Years systemic racism police enforcement plus huge increase angry unemployed people nothing time leads anger reason act.

 random luck, cause effect. like staring directly douche-sun. amount douche absolutely overwhelming. ""I kidding"" excuse, obviously kidding. bathroom mirror shot even remotely jacked, skinny. hair. face. equinox trainer. 

Also terribly sorry happened. would never go righteously infect people. thought part. 

Doesn't know word ""righteously"" means. Thinks ""doing part"" means staying inside 1 week covid going fucking beach party. bother wearing mask, guess qualify ""doing part"".

It's physically painful much asshole guy is. think that's true. spread slowly around ship. testing them. fair, doctors gotten better treating mitigating worst symptoms. long hospital capacity, expect death rate lower NY. Someone edited anti-mask nutjobs [Parks &amp; Rec pandemic serious virus 1. incredibly contagious, 2. extremely deadly, 3. could widely spread asymptomatic carriers.

Not viruses going sit sweet spot. know causes death abolished? looks like junkie tbh merely increase testing, positive rate wouldn’t also increasing. 

But know that, you’re agenda.  Leg amputated? Wtf, why? diabetic? Let know get wall finished. see experiment worked... afar (don’t want jeopardize experiment) study narrow focus - ask ""when around people"" asking inside shops etc. mention public transport, walking streets can't distance safely, packed beaches, events plenty scenarios still happening regular basis. Obviously around people wearing mask superfluous. mostly Biontech making money this, company actually developed one. Florida Africa People literally didn’t know viruses even *were* 1918. following fight, heard today, said husband “oh no, sad, fought long time” replied “why life, that’s sad. everyone else that’s lost life?”. replied, “ example tragic sad virus is”. people may saved journey”. Rip mate  Oh, that's crazy... week long period really sleepy time. 

Now wonder... Probably much, Pfizer vaccine, Biontech (german company) one, thus part largely European initiative make possible European vaccine available everyone low cost. Lol, reputable science/health news sites. science/health news articles glorified links studies may-or-may reflect actual studies findings. Mine 21 18 15 it’s easier they’re older. Maybe type words google call something ""absurd It’s literally text- “seven day average”. 

Maybe misread things lot. said doctor told stay home seven days

No didn't. said 14 days. Everyone planet earth knows 14 days. Protests happened cities control.

It's wearing masks. opening bars. Agreed! think Oxford's Country sure feels great again, it? respiratory issues. I'm oxygen. things need others cannot you. One thing needed go bank. needed go inside. transact business ATM. Unfortunately high risk like going places without mask others wear masks. work around using bandana seem restrictive mask. Former UN expert well known one sided, ideological, politicised positions. UN packed sort ""experts"", happy report UN committes plagued diplomats sent authoritarian, non democratic countries. nonsense.

 No. Where. ;( Kind useless wear mask around people. I’ve lost 13 far!! started free tube yoga. I’m happy be. current lethality 4.4% holds,   
6,864 new batch die.    right. that's exactly I'm saying, can't look tests per capita isolation. also need see many tests returning positives. case, experts agree number confirmed cases paint accurate picture actual number cases. look number daily deaths. accurate deaths respiratory failure CoViD symptoms tested coronavirus. actually Indian government unearths new hotspots. daily deaths India trailed US since beginning pandemic. ""I'm wearing mask, you."" (sharpies RNC low-risk) ""There, fixed you!"" aerosols lower temperature short lived CO2 forever. 

So start emitting aerosols climate change fixed /s think problem we've become accustomed **amazing vacations every year even couple times year.**

Jesus Christ. Get load Mr./Ms. Money Bags here. current lethality 4.4% holds,
6,864 group die.    Wait..the still find evidence airborne transmission COVID 19 conclusive? WTF..at point, hell think getting around? Pfizer vaccine, Biontechs vaccine. Pfizer distribution partner Biontech Biontech necessary production capacities. May want save next pandemic. absurd baseless claim. Proof? Disney implemented system go somewhere else sit 'slot' ride. Seems reasonable many people happily abuse 'front line' method without needing provide evidence disability. could choose swim across river, walk bush, use dirt tracks,""  (NSW police commissioner Mike Fuller, quoted Guardian)
  
Though probably suffering COVID-19 neuron count? marketting institutions far less popular legitimacy yours, even now, yes, public cooperation always going patchy limited, like US issues masks vaccines.

But US can't likely imagine yet detailed ramifications living country whose administration pervasively corrupt dysfunctional implement almost policy, good bad, patchily incompletely. Try imagine bought medicines nearest drugstore, 1 4 would counterfeit, FDA unable address problem cheaper drugstore bribe FDA inspector stop counterfeits. try imagine well administration can't get together inspect certify genuine medicines (an inexpensive effort require vast resources) would address major public health crisis, current pandemic.

Based little know Brazil imagine face similar situation. Penn State University, big 10 football, one largest college stadiums nation. definitely ""destination campus"" 😉 ownvoted? 4 times? Really? people something else. DFW, I've seen numerous reports young people dying homes. I'd bet everything stayed away hospitals fear life crushing debt. Remember said fifteen going zero? effect lower rate spread. terrible. basically poster child everything could go wrong someone catches COVID - strokes, amputation, fungus lungs etc. he's lost battle. poor wife child. difference contagious flu gone away. *in addition* everything else.

Plus we're really still learning virus exist before. Mutiny, ransom shi back cruise line. were. We're majority fucking idiots here. yet least.

Give another decade, we're fast track Idiocracy. 🤷🏻‍♀️ not? largest protests Minnesota, NY, WA, cause huge spikes cases. states reopened earliest AZ, TX, FL, ones going fastest. feels like major depression? point goes effective remote learning. suggest pre-recorded video equivalent reading assignment attendance pointless. agree students able watch video schedule. One values in-person classes instructor tunes presentation real time based questions. addition, one student's questions may spark questions observations others. Further, significant portion class struggles topic demonstrated performance assignment reflected approach instructor following lectures. class participation part learning experience believe taking attendance appropriate. 

That said describe fundamentally self-study. impressive offering premier school. Good hear that. Oh lol different PSU best even though tough talk things out. virus seems take anyone throw cliff without possibly discussion since I'm assuming spouses able visit wives husbands hospital. seems like every day there's another ""Our vaccine looking real good far!!"" understand thing, kinda wish would shut fuck finished product ready deployed, nothing general public gain. simple answer anyone thinks ADA means something. Look word *Accommodation.* home ambulances ánd hospital full limitations act difficult business question people whether specific disability (were exist) applies. Easier depend logic exception threat everyone else. No, tainted food formula. Why? Probably intentional. Wonder why... Egypt Egypt 4D chess True. yet people wonder Sámi trust Swedish all. mention want us ""their"" country anyway Thank 2/3ds qualify going become homeless. Egypt worse Russia dealing criticism, definitely bad China..... yet dad's wife 45 might it, initially thinking get fine, I'm sure think. I'm concerned now... could go full Romantic-era everyone single Grand Tour lifetime. country stupid makes every thing political. Dumb shits would die en masse objectively existing viral pandemic, still look reasons blame political opponent.  find funny call others ignorant may never stepped India interact health care developed country. 

Now indeed shiny compared India amount time wait pay teeth . 

You would wish India. masks? Realistically problem even people are/were asymptomatic potential permanent damage. probably issue later. The. 04 percent number still bad, think we're going see results years come. damaging number let's on. According current models it’d require 60% herd immunity newer models show herd immunity virus could reached 43% - 48% population. 

Here’s one  It’s conclusive course shows trend would down, up, 60% estimates. “But experts say wearing mask *worse* you!” Said ex coworker mine. said “if name two, I’ll buy lunch. went Fauci said 3 months ago, Fox News, let ramble nervously briskly took leave conversation. Smdh. could seen coming? /s

Good luck. Feds hands-off far. But, maybe potential battleground state get special treatment Trump team. 

Stay safe all. So, check thing called Supremacy marijuana still illegal federally. states follow federal guidance highway funding, education funding, etc. entire plethora business, like trucking, airlines, railroads, primarily federally regulated.

Again, idea talking about, making fool yourself.  I'm empathetic I'm sure shit handing free pass. karen. testing one person time, samples multiple individuals would mixed together tested one. test comes back negative, everyone pool clear. positive, member pool tested individually.

Reading magic I'll buy Tom Brady Tampa Jersey wear every Sunday, NFL fans stands fall. Note: hate Brady I'm bitter. surprised whole two meter rule seemed completely arbitrary beginning doubt Tom Cruise going hang anyone anywhere public anyway. He’s going pub crowded beach. infants died Covid? children photos seemed thin normal weight? something could pick make fault too? central authority US. seriously question role executive office is, manage crisis like this. Turning Pandemic governor ""what feel best,"" given connectivity states, bit ridiculous. compared America insulting thing I've ever heard country :( Test groups 10-20 samples, get negative move on. get positive, test one.

It works best massive testing low positive rate  Ah yes, plague wagon. sad... Mexico called T-MEC (Spanish Treaty Mexico, USA, Canada). political semantics Trump, Trudeau, Obrador make appear got upper hand. really fighting them, recognizing tagging exist white blood cells kill them. pattern matcher. much effort body. Brother semi agreeing you, yes need backup claims. arguing guy made 10% number said 5%. evil policy. students foreign safe US. 

It breaks fucking heart know might able come back fall, place safe them. 

This evil.

Edit: anyone resources give students? know it’s long shot, really wanna able assist students ASAP. already shitty milk. guess, it'll get worse. old forever. Anger towards older generations new stuff. 

You angry boomers, vast majority boomers poor rest nothing shift economic landscape past 40 yrs. 

So many crazy political social situations transpired. Blaming generation current issues fruitless endeavor.

You may want someone easy blame state things, vitriol towards boomers helps nothing, learn anything so.

You better understand boomer generation's mistakes talking them, putting down.

They tried. got decent result, best. learn it?

Always remember: Todays progressivism tomorrow's conservatism. shoes subject scrutiny soon enough... Nope. Dont speak us. one upset slightest anything Trudeau done past 5 years. 

Blackface scandal closest could comtempt him, gave heartfelt apology shown us isnt person anymore.

Actually, I'm still kinda mad FPTP debacle that's it. add this, academic report caused media clusterfuck examined 17 ASYMPTOMATIC 17 SYMPTOMATIC cases (read small sample size) found antibody levels diminishing groups 2-3 month mark. 

By means antibodies sole mechanism immunity. Diminishing antibodies mean ABSENT antibodies. 

Memory b cells much indicative long standing immunity antibody titers. ICU admissions probably technically stabilized since they're full places like Tampa. *good*. Unfortunately people follow dying. social distance wear masks. get sick die. kills every day NJ Gov Murphy reads dead. I'm puddle trying work updates cause get emotional entire thing. What's wrong milk? curious, northern friend. figure tons people try defer year take year off. isn’t correct. We’ve months Europe I’ll tell fatality rate doesn’t drop cases skyrocketing. 
What’s happening lack reporting cases deaths. 
This bullshit. 4 months ahead US still worst come. 

Reporting anything but, negligent beyond belief media needs stop seeding false hope. 

Edit: last paragraph Yes agree obviously incorrect reopenings would lead increase cases states already hit hard. convincing evidence suggest outcome, plenty evidence suggest otherwise (South Korea Iran). However, significant increases treatment massively improved public health policy, including far better protection nursing homes, suggest situation death numbers different. Case point, Oxford researchers finding survival rates among hospitalized patients increasing. we’re seeing is, opinion, correction ratio infections deaths. massive mortality rate NYC area beginning pandemic result inexperienced doctors, doctors time, dealing entirely new virus, inadequate protection elderly. understand virus improving treatment every day, death count correcting itself.

The entire idea behind “flattening curve” that, even cases increased reopening, hospitals would prepared deal cases fewer people would die. Outside states like New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, United States success story front. don’t care you’re drunk would say this. need able buy alcohol 24 hours day feel free? Look mirror man. make new flu vaccines months. really comparable coronavirus neither AIDS polio. really?? Fucking hell.. really don’t know sports go pandemic. 

It sucks too, I’d love distraction shit, expensive players, coaches, support staff, families. Well, friend, looks like discovered cure aging. know lab work done students home/off-campus result pandemic. we'd back problem: pressure institutions conduct in-person education campus, even safe so. anyone say right call? right call still tough deal spending $50,000 every semester. also got one brass door opener dealies I've seen online. I'm scared touching doors, really like feel using it. falls sky it’s terrible enough much 😳 long people aren’t busy blaming Americans stupid spread coronavirus without proof, stupid people countries, happy.

This doesn’t taken gospel, feel misconceptions really happening due fact politicized country. hides real cause problem believe lack universal health care paid sick leave. think charge happy see us blaming squabbling amongst politics, masks, whether beaches open status quo remains. screams fake news keeping kids home next year least risk catching possible lot damage mental health social development. 

Children extremely resilient adaptable. Many kids end needing take time school long periods one reason another without issue. means today continue educate kids remotely ability connect friends interact socially remotely level unlike time human history. year outside school building damage nearly much losing parent friend, getting brain damage virus. countries spread virus controlled makes sense get kids back classroom, US spreading like wildfire would irresponsible lead schools closing make whole thing drawn even longer like states reopened bars restaurants safe did.  Smarter POS White House Yes. said stabilized. Really. on? RemindMe! 3 months think people charge denying reality like Japanese Olympic committee. can’t grasp world fundamentally changed. ever meet friendly gypsy would change mind, yet happen. I've met absolute scum trash Seems unlikely based everything I've read. would love wrong. God bless imbecile White House lol ""I'm pleased report situation Chernobyl stable..."" Wow. hope right. Truly.

Despite seeming impossible true. think isolating two variables, ignoring context, thumbing nose people discuss things ridiculously ignorant plane created Obesity risk factor, per CDC. overweight listed risk age following conditions **are increased risk** severe illness COVID-19:  kidney  (chronic obstructive pulmonary  state (weakened immune system) solid organ  (body mass index \[BMI\] 30  heart conditions, heart failure, coronary artery disease,  cell  2 diabetes Gamers paradise too. Well, Fauci saying age coronavirus patients drops 15 years. want happen me. Either R0 1 1. theory, could exactly 1, would quite unlikely. means infection either going going down. virus decide done enough damage gonna chill level awhile. Well, three go perfection! unpopularity ACA huge part red wave 2012. I'm sure Dems win, want repeat that. great, terrible. Fair point 116 130,000 proves point. vaccines?  masks political thing USA?


Here mandatory really hear anyone complaining much it. Stay safe wear mask. live NJ Gov stellar terms keeping us updated reopening state covid. together. get trying study? literally entire population contracts disease, herd immunity irrelevant. rate transmission highly unrepresentative normal population, modeling perspective data seems mostly useless. got nursing home data? Miami herald states “highest-in-the-nation percentages fatalities” “ nursing homes account 50 percent COVID-19 deaths Florida, greater percentage hard-hit states New York New Jersey, roughly line percentages neighboring Georgia Alabama.” Roughly 6% League, pretty much NBA.

Frankly, NHL season fucked. 

The players play icebox, tons close contact, recirculated air. fans breathe air players players get fan's air. basically like playing meat packing plant.

Only way see working fans, moving outside arenas, one really infrastructure yet.

Other outdoor sports like Soccer Rugby probably ok - fans players separate they're open field outside. Even baseball probably fine space seats. understand that’s terrible couldn’t take chance bringing immunocompromised people treatment. would malpractice so. Exactly. idea death counts always going skyrocket cases increase implies “flatten curve” effort doomed start, way adequately prepare hospitals. increasing hospital survival rate documented Oxford researcher contests notion.   thou' sed article says 90 people jail, 87 infected. technically correct, statistic bit alarmist honest. obese. Obese automatically puts high risk severe illness category.

 age following conditions **are increased risk** severe illness COVID-19:  kidney  (chronic obstructive pulmonary  state (weakened immune system) solid organ  (body mass index \[BMI\] 30  heart conditions, heart failure, coronary artery disease,  cell  2 diabetes reaction Swedes. assure know Brits, Spanish, Balkan Americans would react way. What? never said one? said know it. really read newspapers, know.

After looking around bit, seems generally, pressreader application referred to. Although libraries services well.

The site linking name big Danish papers either, probably missing ones talking last comment. 
So that's Sweden Denmark picture, care asking sources library containing every privately owned paid newspaper free?

And insane you? Americans never pay newspapers?

Look, get really like country Sweden. hard least try jump conclusions start spewing hate someone says ""I know access every single newspaper free"". basis anything, borderline sub rulebreaking. mention absolutely obsessed treating Nordic countries completely equal, ""apples apples"", completely different lots lots ways.

I'm sure uni courses take learn Nordic countries, remember seeing looking fun courses exchange program. Oh sure, optics announced looks horrible. Also, I’m guessing little, talent travel usually pretty micromanaged seems plausible keep isolated set &amp; home, assuming talent isn’t asshole insists flouting everything. 

It’s mess, I’m US based everyone’s struggling hell start shooting. Commercials indie movies easier, 40 person crew, major shit like usually involves 200+ people we’re finding new cleaning/distancing needs actually increases number. 

I think industry actually try careful start back up. can’t imagine union film environment wouldn’t forced shut least week moment crew member tests positive. it’s main cast, you’d commission least month. stoppage costs shit-load money, hopefully companies behave responsibly, 🤷‍♂️ Less 1% least two. like month Friendly reminder white supremacists ruined word Boogaloo everyone. Yes! thinking thing. sorts anxiety pandemic, course, somehow wear mask feel kind invisible. social anxiety decreased quite bit. eat like pigs, problem. put donuts. Demark excellent example this. parents still choosing keep kids home societal safety net allows put CHILD's safety first job. Fuck Florida! 
My best friend dying Cancer!
And can't go her. 
You dumb fucks! care man's then. clear there's dialogue this. 0 faith we'll football. fact fans allowed stadiums also boggles mind. entirely possible deaths continue decline because: 

1) already ravaged nursing homes/long-term care facility patients vulnerable regarding mortality. 

2) better treating whether drugs ventilating patients immediately.  

3) average age infection decreased drastically meaning younger people responsible case surges therefore cases less likely end mortality reduced age. Yikes. Add 1st amendment subtle/not squashed discourse. 
And 2nd means enforced really easily, freaky.

I mean get haters American ethos, nasty self serving part it, selfish part. two amends. missing everywhere else, little unnerving know history, WW2 basically govts. historically. Let's see actual independent investigation.

And mean truly independent inquiry can't shut like Moreland Commission was.  number cases getting lot attention. know getting attention late? number deaths. Actually that's valve, correct. stupid decision willfully evil one?   normally paranoid? combining testing tracing, absolutely stop pandemic. That’s Germany done it. Masks weren’t mandatory Germany late April, numbers already dropped significantly. get impression condition made worse hospitalization. induced coma contributing blood clot amputation. continuous infections. It’s easy understand get infections hospital. Eh. France Spain open bars, cafes restaurants nearly month they're ok. think different Europe community transmission low now. Ha sign ‘Masks Suck!’.. pretty much sums mentality. Reminds toddler throwing temper tantrum. People can't afford travel unless they're fucking loaded almost everywhere. Matagorda Sargent beaches open... Big crowds, little effort distancing masks articles months old, source.

Also, used terms **speculation** **if** define possibilities, _it could happen_. make comment spread _fear mongering_.

As wrote comments below, _No need panic. little aware. Like wanting cross road high traffic density._ inconsiderate asshole literally everyone around (by wearing mask) selfishness, definitely ""strength,"" lmfao. Hahaha wonder happened guy? loser.  India's current prime minister mini Trump. dumb shit give appearance toughness. bars 1000 x worse beaches IMHO. beach distance, droplets likely fall harmlessly sand get irradiated sun die exposure. preaching choir there. fees alone stupid. Thankfully last year, prime dorm close bulk classes dorm kids got along great we'd chat moving out.

It's hard everyone. used freedom, stuck home. mrs teaches home months. cooped feeling stuck. get daughter much possible. friends facetime none want person visits, even distance. 

The upside daughter got PT job healthcare place pays well, making decently weekly check gets house.

This one hot mess though. Check r/covid19 (a sub followed scientists worldwide working vaccines medicines studies). 

And MedCram YouTube — he’s pulmonologist Cali working C19 patients start longstanding YouTube channel med students nurses — completely reliable agenda. hope happens sustainable cruise ships come along. wonder much faster problem would solved say East Grand Rapids turns second wave Victoria caused leakage hotel quarantine, low lying transmission. genomic testing show That's true all. far smallpox humans.

Polio almost eradicated 1 type still circulating Afghanistan Pakistan.

Measles keeps coming back due best efforts anti-vaxxers.

And Malaria developed world. Well, they're kind healthy, they?  thinking delaying dentist appointment decided go anyway, good thing did. found lingering gum infection treated it. Happy went. :) Technically, no. spread via tiny water droplets coughing sneezing. Thank you. like you. curious - think vaccine like Oxford one would rushed?

The reason moving along quickly unlike normal diseases, ton candidates willing tested participate trials right now. wait cases pop hope they're willing want see customer feedback first.

This trials for. People stabbed shot this. depend help customers. 4D chess Yeah, campuses refunded quickly. UNC people started sue. $390.00 closest cure remdesivir

 Clearly time reopen universities politicalization covid-19 country USA) profoundly disgusts me. Even disturbing selfishness, willful ignorance, lack compassion.  They’re selling candidates, billions doses, governments around world. It’s breaking vaccine testing incentive make vaccine works, one makes good headlines make sale. dumbest move rising epidemic pretend nothingburger. makes everything less efficient dealing virus. death atributed COVID complications? Trumps EGO issue, virus medical one left pros. Hahahahaha, no. Even aren’t increased risk physically still stay home unable wear mask. someone anxious can’t wear mask tf hospitalized going go? roads lead terribly. probably worse Brazil. today, can't even get basic otc medicines town. insanely difficult take preventive measures bc a) people care b)even impossible social distance bc population density/poverty. counting animal vectors. Richest nation? know much US debt? 

I'm sure heard remdesivir TV Government trust issue.
Mainly government give 2 shits using population test shady shit. 
The eugenics program comes mind. Tbh, speculation new pandemics might break frequently. 

I love zero source zero knowledge behind it, fear mongering sub decided upvote anyways. Amazing people take advantage adversity instead complaining it. might tissue samples still lying around lucky. No, doesn't. read something cbc.com they're going testing donor blood try get handle underlying asymptomatic cases. course Canadian response way socially mature ours. get cbc.com news feed, keep track people rational country. I'm surprised Americans trapped there. One woyld think could get pass out. know majority Canadians want border reopen. much gonna charge it? free. can't research go law school, *that's sign go law school.*

There so, so, many articles. have** sat shut fuck let CDC take charge

So, Trump issue. that’s still case. MERS vaccine candidates years, including ones phase 3 trials don’t make market. vaccine overconfidence Covid isn’t good. Governments buying billions doses unproven vaccines. It’s incentivizing pharmaceutical companies release early, relatively meaningless, data. forget casinos, everything almost touched. actually fucking wild even opened. state is. American version:  something suspected may protecting younger generations severe cases older generations may MMR part scheduled childhood vaccinations would susceptible Covid. obviously requires research, could lead easier time re-opening schools vaccinations already provide level protection. common cold kill. Nothing short stint reeducation camp convince anyone thinks hoax. two people one room (one covid positive one negative) touch even touch items touched know fact healthy person got room mean airborne ?

This happened many times. Congrats!! Keep that’s awesome France highly centralized. Germany federal, fine Overwhelming majority people US impacted enough PTSD. Survivors maybe, healthcare workers maybe. 98% country, no. love this! made political rather die admit defeat. Covid causes hypercoaguable state. Combine stuck bed ventilator, people chemically paralyzed ventilator, we’re seeing ton nasty clots resulting amputations, strokes, pulmonary emboli, etc. Same! cat age. lost pretty much teeth except fangs, still moves like he's lot younger 19. old people die “en masse”. excess mortality aged 0-45 almost negligible. excess mortality 80+ staggering. 

As in, overwhelm funeral homes staggering. young people risk nearly 0. One way another, we'll go back normal. I've decided stop reading COVID news entirely months. Covid 19! ""people"" need re-education camps. Arrest jail Good Thing Tump signed executive order...to create garden house Statues 'American Heroes'... pictures seen people wore masks* Holy FUCK made detailed post before? could link readings go? sorry loss livelihood, thank compassion others, selfish, seeing big picture. hope good things come way things even better corona you. Thank setting good example. Thankyou!!! I've saying ages! point... why?

It's like anything going make look like handled worse US Brazil country like difficult keeping check. story sounds similar, found much relief though baking soda. teaspoon cup water hour im sick hell feel normal. Asymptotic asymptomatic? keep seeing people using words interchangeably, annoying could arguably relevant discussion. scared face reality, can't handle it. denial self protection dumb cowardly. Narcissism. want one thing, whatever want, whomever want, whenever want. 

Anything universe says might get decried enemy. narcissist’s worst nightmare better themselves. new disease, doubt w long term complications disease. lot people sub try paint picture 90% healthy people “long term” pneumonia like complications isn’t case true number unknown . went yale. go law school. gain loss weight. Slightly increase mental stability, despide economical uncertainty. Slight improvement familiar relations. Slightly increase alcohol consumtion.

Not great neither bad experience.  anti-intellectual set politicized facts, science, reason defining politics opposition reality, course masks political. Unfortunately them, they've finally run problem denial, wishful thinking, propaganda make go away. Pretty sure long it’s rule everyone private business tell fuck right off. mask rules like shirts shoes service. Don’t see people freaking rules Great, virus going away. /s 100 million feel nearly enough. Nope, 300$ per semester two thirds public transport ticket entire state. matter one life less value another. Statistical comparisons need several dimensions order give better understanding produce reliable models. type statistic context placed makes huge difference.

I family member working Covid ICU, people dying daily. Every death affects staff point suffering PTSD. make less caring slight relief seven people died yesterday compared 12 day last week.

Yes, Reddit shit-pit time cannot assume everyone prejudices, even understanding. Actually current outbreak likely leaked quarantine hotel holding international arrivals. logic mask effective unless wearing p100. curious cogent explanation. Yup, cancelled like doctor's appointments essential. Like listen know blood pressure high need work eat better. fell ill receive level care politician today. get plasma early on, example? doubt it.  Thanks Lol COVID advice Texas institution. thanks. probably pressured play risk. took lockdown chance quit drinking. Easier without work stress lost 15 pounds.

What drinking, milkshakes? excellent points except SARS-related immunity. Japan actually never reported single case SARS virus known infected 8000 people Holy shit, fucking sad. Canadian government run ads saying...

""Stay fuck away! Sorry"" worth, Americans would like quality investigate reporting this. Florida, Texas California. someone missed word ""nuance"" speed read dictionary Please provide evidence spike cases due protests. festival wook 6 months ago, Reddit virology expert today. lmao 🗑️🧠 disagree. believe lot countries would like hey um virus killed hundreds thousands people span months guys need take seriously. Instead didn’t want blame &amp; harassment virus originated country report virus water samples Barcelona March 2019 reliable, water probably contaminated pandemic. know mean, frankly speaking, least, far know, possible origin virus China.

They're really thing, asserting ignorant best, likely intentional intellectual dishonesty. reason you’d go isn’t pandemic. way talking scientific name calling? Got that’s need know. others sub plus social media internet reason country continues lockdown. Sheep narrative. Blinders on. Plus they’re fairly cheap vacations, depending you’re going kind room stay in. Food’s included activities free. Even companies go one pop take place. common theme low humidity.

Did imply **Florida** low humidity? Haha no, even close. Hawaii highest mask rate nation 58% recent poll. NYC 70% wave F☆ck Mr. Roboto I've back gym month Things change fast summer Covid.

It's wishful thinking, intuition. can't lie I've pretty chilled throughout chaos. Got spend time really trying understand kind person everything gets back normal really hope so! 2021 worse 2019 still manage much much better 2020. issue hospitals reaching capacity.

Yeah, reports worrying me, too. Hopefully, information misleading news. Like, there's still lot asymptomatic people hospital. We'll massive malpractice president.

It open economy Texas. would governor. Auto-bots worst.  thought so, got bored hell two weeks. Gee, wonder they're differently America. allowing people whip paranoia, allowing paranoids reddit validate you. Stop it.

You're experiencing type mania hysteria need snap of.

Locking entire country severe overreaction compared severity virus. even scientific basis. gonna fight, please consider wearing mask sake others

No thanks. going wait majority population vaccinated run course? we're dealing TB AIDS type outcome keeps breaking slowly months months, what? people arrogant they're gambling everything herd immunity fairy tale. Nice VA perfect lot better private system. Also depends location going treatments. fucked. I’ll honest. needed break life. working like crazy 6 years straight. Dropped University, worked overtime take mind depression. Go college, still working side I’m essentially 60 hour weeks two. Graduate keep working like madman I’m conditioned it. First time forced relax. It’s nice. really want get back work full steam I’ve reset, like lol Keep mind leading causes death like car accidents way way down. rise numbers means even looks. seem focused telling ""team"" better one metric matters per capita death toll

But get feeling ego, facts pretty risky potentially dangerous? Like said, matter protests about. Gatherings people spread virus. Mask not, risk still there. kill people cops year. fan base fraud Ramdev ffs. guy releases Immunity booster COVID cure, even media starts defending till he's exposed. 20k deaths 10,000% already gone month, enjoy it. things always want never feel like invest time, like (for lot people) reading. started taking Harvard's free ChinaX series courses Edx lockdown learn China.

Keep mind lockdown enacted Mar 9th. India loves good bit propaganda. Indian workmate shares lot WhatsApp group. poorly edited clips various sources made support message. Let’s hope so. sounds like disaster waiting happen. Considering like 50 million people anecdotes cases severe post-viral fatigue, it‘s probably rare. anything even remotely common hundred thousands people would complaining lungs etc. low daily death rate attributes North East able contain it. look Connecticut Michigan today, usually post 100 deaths each, today none. New York cut hospitalization drastically, Massachusetts also South, hospital max out, Wednesday states seem like hitting new record death, case especially hospitalization. important statistic hospitalization, even thought young infected right now, eventually go old overload hospital, hospital South already experience Title outright misleading, then. basically saying ""Young people asthma worse elderly, diabetic, etc.""

Uh, okay. That's really argued. question ""Does asthma make COVID19 deadly asthma?""

Compare series asthmatic patients, alongside non-asthmatic patients, age, pre-existing conditions, **then** write article. Well, can't pretend know really, could Trumps Narcissism ability deny reality, could Trump held five known phone calls Vladimir Putin: March 30, April 9, April 10, April 12, June 1 Last Ship TV series. first .4% .024%? Lmao day let upholstered men’s room dictate what’s funny what’s ain’t happening anytime soon. enjoy seeing people like get worked nothing. I'm worried fact parents think okay send kids back school like this. Even children vulrable group, still fking dumb that. need. I'm happy anything slow spread virus Dont get excited yet. Michigan many local departments report weekends holiday weekends especially. awesome none reported, doesnt mean none occurred. accurate numbers Tuesday-Friday, slight dip Saturday, huge drop Sunday, slight rise Monday. Every single week. Streets paved actual street... earth would go gym pandemic Shame Americans fat stupid realise need pandemic thing. Hopefully none family get visit Obviously. stupid enough go gym knowing could catch / spread deadly virus literally deserve get around there? That's good hear masks. gonna fight, please consider wearing mask sake others. body may weak premed bio major published author try strong aspects life control. No, I'm fine JHU WM. Either fine. meant him, harmless him...but read one son's gal pal covid? guess 1% dangerous...to him. can't speak understand wanting know it. getting better understanding virus sub about? definitely see comment others similar one could people trying blame something else keep ignoring give people benefit doubt. There's chance they're trying learn shaming helping anyone. even cover everything bogus stuff they've done, including stuff they're seemingly sul involved in

I pointing silver lining wheb class real people attendance, they're gonna proximity infecting other, haha let get friend. Hang there. pandemic got mental health hard struggling get back mental health needs be, faith humanity. much money research poured pandemic strongly believe get look back remember relieved going anymore can.

Your leader failed steak salesman.  Sorry, thought since Coronavirus subreddit, could get data, given I'm interested studying virus. Again, rest peace, hope wife child recover tremendous loss. lag behind, people dying weeks lockdown started.

You’re trying play “Gotcha” discussion, it’s childish sad. Public funding universities fallen cliff last 40 years demand risen, requiring investment buildings, technology, instructors, etc. money come somewhere, coming states. 

If demand universities go down, corporations requiring degree entry level jobs promotions, universities could reduce hiring, mothball buildings, offer lower tuition fees entice students. now, ""motivated compete"" students year needing instructors, labs, food, housing, counseling, doctors, student jobs, things university provides students. 

Most students would gladly get university hamster wheel companies would hire allow advance. happens, universities continue see increased enrollments increased need services students. costs money, unless states step plate help out, arms race continue. idea lockdown isn’t it’s final solution problem. Lockdown used buy us time find vaccine. also lowers amount infected people cases don’t spread beyond hospitals manage. medical intervention, mortality rate skyrockets. 

If enough people get sick problems start occur: supply chain break down, won’t enough healthy people take care ill, healthcare workers die leaving sick people without care, people permanent damage organs survive it. suck stay socially distant wear damn mask go out. It’s difficult “ravingislife” 

You weak hedonist you’re older 20 disappointed Well thank service sir. This. mentality whats eating away America. Sweep shit rug pretend everything's ok. Many get sick hospitalised. Depends, dude. lived central tx college, live Vegas now, quality life contentmess index decreased dramatically. run away Austin Dallas monthly get away college area, still maintain urban Nevada much refuge better state governance Texas offered.  issue hospitals reaching capacity. There's fake news way hide fact. Texas hospitals overwhelmed, morgues overflow soon corpses forklifted freezer trucks hospital parking lots like New York. massive malpractice president. unpredictability gets me. mostly taking old underlining health condition, also taking healthy, random amount others would think effected. morbid reminder death come anybody anytime. 

I hope one things two younger generations (Z Alpha) learn take life stability granted. Things change matter weeks sometimes overnight. Remember took little less 3 weeks New York shutting peak new cases. back Coronavirus new scary.

I hope Houston prepping temporary hospitals, they're going need them. Obviously anyone get sick covid, odds requiring mechanical ventilation increase dramatically obese. am, cause people like aren’t

The weak fear strong Yes, a-holes FIGHTING wear mask Walmart.

Its disturbing shallow selfish people be. This. mentality whats eating away America. Sleep shit rug pretend everything's ok. Gas degrades time. eventually lead harm car’s engine. Might want start driving car tank runs get fresh gas. Chinese CDC made public accouncement regarding mysterious sars like virus bsome time December. literally Taiwanese government knew it. [always](http://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirusvirus) propogandists spouting fear. way worse back March. \~130,000 dead, 55,000 cases day (compared 35,000), four epicenters, hospital staff fatigued, economy shit, etc. health issues would make fighting coronavirus tough husband serious discussions want far intervention worst case scenarios. me, I'm willing go ventilator long term, want resuscitation heart stops. already living we're planning writing one case. sounds morbid hard conversations loved ones, think right something doing. Yeah I'll pass. time truly sick last 10 years one time got flu vaccine. Never again. Extrovert here, I'm loving working home. amputated leg virus tho?  That's stores businesses - talking generally home. Glad see number relatively high least in-store use. saw guy going get double lung transplant news.

He didn’t make sadly. Rest easy means unspecified amount. First all, idea you. Second all, fact think nothing you, therefore ""it happen lot people"" get literally demonstrates incapable critical thought are. 

Unfortunately, capable critical thought really consider humility possibly keeping opinions yourself. First wave definitely over. looking better day though. wait total deaths comparing year year. Allergies possibly- gf experiencing similar things. comes goes her.

Also, knows, maybe it. tests inaccurate, there's much incentive doctors tell not.

Either way, best act best interest others still limiting/quarantining much possibly can.

But experiencing severe symptoms consistent, worry much covid. depends get tested too, e.g. tested day 10. 


I know Italy's numbers well, least 5k tests per day might shortage testing. top 5k new cases, almost every tests positive, indicating tests real sick people. Thus short period peak cases vs peak deaths.  following updates condition People.com, genuinely believed would eventually come alive. I'm actually disgusted stupid fucks crowding bars beaches picking fights grocery store employees people like Nick Cordero suffer die hooked tubes ventilators, unable loved ones nearby say goodbye.

Until solve problem rampant selfishness stupidity country, COVID-19 never go away, deaths like continue happen. WHAT?!? respect mental handicaps! 

RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE! doesnt matter anything reopens, effect always going same. virus cant eliminated cant stoped sadly. 

Closing kicking problem future, creates bigger problem: extreme poverty believe stock investors public runs away it. states requirements reinstated  Worth dividing society even alienating huge portion people?

Well, shall see... “stuck” New Zealand right went rugby game last week. really surreal experience. felt wrong packed stadium discovered vaccines first place. Chinese 10th century found grinding scabs people smallpox powder form sniffing it, inoculated people it. virus different nature small pox, I'm sure simply exposed dead virus cell raw form would boost immunity. Even survived COVID reportedly lost immunity months. Dead small pox cells sure lot easier harvest COVID cells need someone cough up. No, definitely yet, keep lying?

It looking better day though. yet still tons people refuse wear mask, refuse socially distance (they see wearing mask get close you), etc, etc. wife fat.... That’s zoom for. 13yo zoom party. helped. joke doesn’t leg stand Oh great! listened today's TWiV yet, thanks reminder. Dr. Griffin's clinical updates always enlightening. biggest, greatest numbers. Fines, arrests. would trick done consistently. H2HT? Google help much lol Q—was post screened bot held moderation? posted CNN coronavirus link (USA) held moderation specifically stating cnn.com may reliable news source. It’s bit ironic since plenty Fox links :) days wake feeling ok. days, like today, wake wonder fuck even bother.

I'm stuck working shitty job hate, options (that continue dwindle,) we're see severe economic impacts likely cause infinitely damage virus could ever hoped achieve.

The thing kept going playing music, what's point?

I feel tremendously guilty human every single day. what’s that? good soury ? bad english? "" Sorry hear daughter deal that. thing happened Walmart closest me. first days state mandates came employees really good enforcing social distancing masks - polite yet firm. know details apparently much anger directed associates Walmart completely gave turn blind eye everything - aisle direction signs, store capacity masks. That’s ok. Anti vaxxers die lol let kids get Snapchat FaceTime. It’s good pre-pandemic socializing loving “taboo” lol point virus already everywhere, letting cruise ship employees come shore isn’t going change much school requiring in-person classes Thanksgiving, go online, means choice live campus.

No masks required even mentioned.

All said ""Before class everyday take temperature ask feel sick, so, avoid going class."" exact experience. honestly want quit stay home, enough ride hoping fix house soon. one manager wears mask nose another manager went different store (in uniform) flex freedom give employees hard time refusing wear mask call manager complain. 


I really starting hate people. Can't trust robots man. many people extra careful. people aren't. infuriating. That’s lot- nice. I’ve lost ten can’t belive good feels stretch. Can’t remeber ever noticing that. Congrats good health! Could dumb thing college alternate online inperson every day. way everyone gets unhappy, sick deal online. LOL January March, spread disease became serious, Fauci &amp; cdc actively discouraged use masks among general public.

Surgeon General Jerome Adams even tweeted masks ""not effective preventing"" COVID-19 general public, saying, ""Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!""

Fauci 60min saying United States reason people walking around Fauci admits public health officials misled public effectiveness want people worry coronavirus, danger ""just minuscule."" want take precautions ""influenza outbreak, second wave."" Risk coronavirus USA 'minuscule'; skip mask wash healthy young person, reason want go cruise ship, go cruise ship.”
Anthony Fauci, Director sort misinformation damaging. misleading public public official
is never good idea. reason officials advocating masks ensure health care workers sufficient stock, say without emphasizing masks useless preventing infection. pure contradiction makes citizens trust government less; hence currently ppl refusing wear masks.  I'm Oklahoma now, friends reporting much better there. imagine still better surrounding areas, issue lot party spots Austin large gatherings that's biggest issue them. peaceful protesters

hahaha, stop watching CNN fucked. help many give fuck go outside wearing masks. Seriously, closest park one wearing bunched together. wrestle school, needed lift get stronger. Since masks required, thought everyone would wearing mask, wrong. also assumed would less people there, people went gym February. share med people trustworthy follow? Yup. I've got something going right hand. sure causing lot pain, swelling, stiffness middle finger. risk exposure virus (I'm high risk) lack health insurance think I'm going get used able bend right middle finger anymore. How's unnecessary? doctor prescribed able fill they're out? What's unnecessary? ones actually working would getting paid. engineering normal sailors still running ship getting paid. wish would lose sense smell lol. depends geography. Alberta example, anyone get tested. big provinces made relatively difficult. plus side, weight problem, thinning up. Loss smell takes joy eating. Taste smell closely linked. Welp, exists now. Ouch. Really? expected y’all

Also, username checks damn last time remember 9 elixir. course Sweden first wave. Happy? Currently panic attack doctor told go ER right due symptoms chronic health issues. delayed treatment long. time truly speakeasy. FDA actually suck, remember mask shortage back March? FDA blocked Chinese mask export KN95 political reasons......

The massive fckup U.S. due Trump administration. CDC, FDA, alot agencies part it. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Many people India tested. sad. It’s true exact use can’t admit patients.  mean, borders Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia Western Australia closed months now. New South Wales realizing Victoria problem. come new cases date deaths? Everyone knows weekends usually show lower number deaths see spike Tuesdays. comes new infections consistent throughout week. Well yeah... unnecessary antibiotics really bad thing take. news tested 3 different kind tests, provide consistent results, always careful assume person even negative test results.  Austin. pretty bad, progressiveness mean much many think means mask wearing. don’t...not good like Castaway IRL

wiiiiilssssoooooonnnn....... Well AAP seems think it’s best kids go back school person fall.

Most places pushing school person. see anxiety online people worried kids getting this, don’t see reflected people real world... floss first Paid actor Good Job Toronto &amp; Stay safe !!! :) - Montreal. ""Second wave"" implies first one ever ended. never did. fact, initial outbreak virus slowed lockdowns mitigation measures. thing barely gotten started brother. That's truth. destroying world another level. Hope patients get recovered it. life like. Getting loads good quality sleep, grinding commute, saving money, eating healthy, plenty fresh air walking, stuck overlit soul vacuum shit day every day. Work something do, somewhere go. get daily work done couple hours home without pointless distractions/meetings/traveling. Already decided I’ll quit go back old way working. Fuck that. I'm total weirdo, live release serology studies. There's much important information reveal. I'm guessing testing accounted fraction infections. Actual # infections probably 500K-1M. Texas, please stay home. need leave house, wear mask. It’s heartbreaking see getting hit hard, went northeast.  Florida could vote blue? Holy shit Imagine nanodrones 3D. make holograms happen I've sore throat 2 months, sometimes cough nose congested went Dr said suspect covid could wrong? Whenever get sick cold flu, remind I’ll feel better week so. Knowing illness cripple healthy person months eventually taking life horrifying. curbside pick comes in, applicable.

I'm sure customer concerned enough stores would allow employee shop them. covid caused get blood clots led needing leg amputated Thanks, didn’t time look wanted wrong “right” direction. Maybe also strong freedumb like USA? Calling now: schools open, bunch kids get sick, die, people bitch Fauci saying 4 months ago infection among children unlikely. almost though understanding virus becomes clear time goes know know know it... TwO wEeKs  personally breathed sigh relief upon hearing recovery. Hanks nice Hollywood.  wear whole time though. Trust get lol, actually started typing one deciding check post history first. anyone think Abott issue hard hard lockdown anytime soon? like month like 2 days week settle everything. feel like would helpful least temporarily appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* July 23-24 4 billion? really proud local Chinese place. restaurant get take thorough careful. call order in, pay phone, show built small room inside door restaurant box food it. human contact all. leave, come wipe surfaces next person. seriously top shit we're extra glad we've always liked food.

It's now, reading this, wondering ""no human contact whatsoever"" approach protect virus. :( Oh fucking well.. lol piss people off. sadly become rather clear two common elements universe hydrogen human stupidity. optimistic think things would normalized July. Foolish foolish February me. Appreciate references here. I've following closely well (I popular comments r/covid19 regarding CDC Roosevelt followup) think overview fairly accurate.

As far actual science goes, next data look in-depth look T-cell response. know Abs wane, infections result Ab response, Abs protective; need learn protection inferred T-cell response primary infection, specifics related protection (which Cells protect, titers, role priming play, etc.), longevity degree protection secondary infection conferred cells. 

Basically everything we're beginning understand Abs, also need learn cells. expect that's coming (in response know immunology, think groups definitely looking pave way investigating cell response) that's less established field research since much easier study diseases involve viremia (and thus focus Ab response).

More on-topic, we'll definitely able achieve level cell response vaccines, there's growing body evidence significant cell response effective terms protection. worry many, many spike protein-targeting vaccines (all 'Operation Warp Speed' candidates...) less effective prone unintended/unprotective results target viral body whole virus, even simple things like adjuvants help boost cell response significantly contexts w/ vaccines. Nvm healthy rip can’t this. lung cancer problem breathing. people need less dramatic favorite one locust lady. Oooook. Enjoy alternate reality. got work morning dude fun bubble. She’s convinced guys tv show bigamist actually reported around last couple days Deaths usually become exponential hospital beds run out. Texas ain’t yet. kid won’t even remember him...and stories mom remember... goddamn course 13 weeks, Tony Award-nominated star endured several difficulties hospitalization, including undergoing leg amputation, waking medically-induced coma procedures temporary pacemaker.

I've never seen evidence Coronavirus Antibidy Dependent Enhancement (the mechanism Dengue increase danger second infection) leading second, worst infection naturally. case, would getting fucked common colds. Maybe millions attend, 5,000. U.S. roughly 10% add recovered death cases, get total, see percentage death

([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Tbh, speculation new pandemics might break frequently. Chinese scientists actually recently discovered new virus similar one caused swine flu. also potential cause another pandemic.

If one happen 2021 scale similar or, fucked then, bigger one, world might really break. pandemic already caused enough stress people reaching saturation point. might care much next one leading greater disaster.

Novel viruses far terrifying seem first. So, please, sake, least family's, burn mask. Stuff box throw corner storage destroy them. new deadly one breaks out, stop people buy masks. It'll rip everyone much could.

Also, burning would cause pollution might cause complication people breathing problems ; p did. quarantined 14 days got follow test negative. got CT scan. Liver enzyme. Bloodwork diabetes. Lipid panel. 
 Everything checked ok. A1C slightly elevated assume due stress exercising much normal. can’t believe administration thinks harm death 1% population, 3.3 million people, acceptable. actually close one cats possibly ones SARS MERS, diseases stick around long enough confirm trials. We're talking MS protests nearly large LA protests. unis real jam. Parents aren’t willing pay full price online product; local economies getting wiped spiral accelerate kids stay home, especially international ones; thousands workers security, food, administration, maintenance either students look 8 weeks laid off.

Lots college towns aren’t going recover many years. Hey, there's sorts dysfunctional families world. aren’t even listening see lol shows Fox News opinion news figured weirdo response made aggy replied instinctively lol dropped college. wasn’t smart enough it. 

That isn’t option me.

It’s part human nature empathy strangers Shit. That’s terrible. He’s hospitalized long. I’m sad hear this. Oh god remember those! Yup, one classic, really tough moral dilemmas neither choice upside. know, kind difficult, complicated, nuanced dilemmas simply don’t handle well country. One strong, competent leadership well educated public capable critical thinking required minimize harm find best possible outcome sea poor outcomes. It’s good thing tools.

I 5 year old, he’s already less selfish third adults country... Downvotes incoming. 

I'll first! One closest friends Canada, says socialized medicine crappy. trying immigrate says lots Canadians come US get medical care pay whatever price otherwise wait years life threatening. conservative either. good friend Scotland remember complaining thing. needed back surgery wait two years could get it. Meanwhile wear massive back/neck brace time raising toddler. seem easy fix healthcare issue. I've heard get trump office. I've heard going disappear election.  I've heard second wave fall worse. 10 people 14 opinions Anonymized location data, publicly available social-media information, data smart thermometer app. worth noting [public health already thing used inform &amp; tailor epidemiological models. type predictive algorithm merely raises certainty models, may hold predictive capability own.

The fact website, probably cellphone, likely social-media accounts, means seem setting bar undesirable surveillance wildly surpassed.

At least ability save lives, rather build advertising profile. Pessimist here! glass glass water it, stop layering hopes dreams metaphor onto inanimate fucking object! Honestly, beginning get bored. get liberate hazmat suit abandoned 'facility', find suitcase full worthless money use cook, hide terror wasteland raiders? Reality letting again...


I plans. gonna go certain supine british mp's house tell 'told so', noooo, instead gotta stay home get better cooking get lives better balance... FML.


I'd say sardonic sarcastic. Hell, like electricity much want survive armageddon... would women work cruise ship? That’s something send man 6 months time send money back home family. Beyond stupid. Like violently arrogant. *I read faces book mild flu, doctor saying different liar.*

Like, *fuck* aunt Karen, know coronavirus food poisoning, know better anyone medical degree. Go search vitamin D, least two past week still randomized controlled trial opinion thing could settle question. people I've seen crowds wearing masks. unfortunate enough need groceries Saturday morning Publix packed. one social distancing unmasked boomer like 1ft behind breathing neck. People taking seriously Florida. work hotels horrifying many state cars parking lots one wearing mask. really saying legitamizes group people essentially children throwing tantrum. grandparents 80s binge watch conspiracy videos YT think masks bad health. sending emails saying things like thankfully state locked required masks, they're going shopping eat. IIRC grandmother moderately high blood pressure too. high risk group caught it, there's significant chance I'll one grandparent, almost guaranteed least one end ICU. two kids school district it. Neither knew other, one high school, one elementary. They’ve recovered week icu. 
But we’re weird ones won’t let children around anyone. 🙄 say anything bad. seemed inevitable given steady bad news. I'm sure held onto whatever slim hope could. I've there, know. Texas 20-30 year olds ones filling hospitals. said spread others. people claiming still effected months later. fair they’re young excuse needs die. One devices use ICU Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation machine. 

It's associated high risk blood clots even blood thinners. attacked leg left gangrenous covid also increases chance getting clots. next idea. experts telling necessary tackling pandemic, unified approach. 50 governors whatever feel like approach clearly working. Trump vaccine syringe full bleach. also predict DeSantis ignore/deny it; water wet. 

Oh wait till there’s footage hospital workers dumping bodies back freezer truck... actually way that's good encounter hardship age, makes responsible after. get kinda thing late 40's-50's even learn something late knowledge help much. Meh millennials second time 15 years. Welcome misery Good you. There’s ample evidence reason countries like Japan gotten lightly already wearing masks even covid arrived. I’m glad wasn’t one! Oh! WOW!!!! Europe American tourists? BLISS! too, I've getting much reading can. little 4000 pages far. Feels good read again. Japan. someone family sick, everyone (or least sick person) wears masks home, sleep too. houses big enough otherwise, many families Tokyo living 50 square-meter space less. Many us grew like natural.

It really, really, really big deal. I've pushups, burpees bulgarian split squats home. Quick easy routine that's better nothing require anything. give good effect proper gym workout 15 minutes. asked Bill Gates, that's also dad's name. mean mine theirs?

Numbers speak themselves, one highest death rates Covid19 Europe nothing brag about. propaganda WHO's favorite child attempting float deadliest administration Sweden's history. change position. fact, week think charalmagne interview, well covid reeking havoc NY, said he'd veto msm news segment. give af. getting paid big pharma like Trump. Playing kids, going camps Honestly shit years cyber warfare misinformation coming head. many people fucking batshit believe ridiculous conspiracies. problem though, without enough hospital resources, see spike deaths. Right now, spike cases recent past hospital capacity patients staff/equipment available prevent dying. resources run bc exceed surge capacity, will, thats people would otherwise survived start dying. data ab get real scary yep almost finished second week them. 22 went deep end alcohol, better still feel terrible. mean, maybe teach lesson? got asthma? That's underlying condition. black? Underlying. left handed. got chart shows that's underlying researching why. birth control? Underlying. parents die young? Underlying. HX foster care? Adopted?

Stop it. thing left unable run 500 metres used able swim 5 k work. point fool. read story believe it. people went nothing short horrific. 
Comparing someone telling wear mask stop spread virus speaks volumes spoilt ungrateful people become.

I like wearing mask that's do. slavery , coming new world order, protection. Probably going pay full-boat already insurance cover it. Outdoors too. doesnt magically disappear outdoors. LOL. Also 3 kids rough. good things, older one really struggling. ( 2nd grader) here. I’m grocery truck driver I’ve working whole quarantine. days feel motivated lately I’m burnt out. make decent money I’m still barely able afford anything bills weekly expenses, people know unemployment buying whatever want. goals wanted achieve soon keep getting steamrolled current affairs. 

On top tiny sore throat called work today. I’m sure it’s allergies I’m worried even more. can’t take much longer america something different Reading idiots, trying imagine remake ""World War Z"", would more.... realistic.

This realistic pandemic/apocalyptic movie look like. Alternatively, death pretty good bills jobs... mean left. plus rare complaint people wearing masks. Also complaints street racing.  Yep. Almost like overpriced medical insurance system tied current employer bad idea... cost much medical bills? Whoops fired, right work, don’t want premiums going up. Seriously? Title is, complicated.?

Glad Mexico Canada vigilant. pisses people selfish they'd spread this. know what's fun? true. Straight people enforce rules manipulating children using childlike naivety spy regulate actions straight families.

Most us gays kids want them, look straight people, society, happy nothing it.

I hope wife stay strong whole thing. Mama it’s really bad disguises. general public give shit big names die personally affects them. Fucking selfish. bring millenials this. Statistically 30-45 years age population likely wear masks right now. Also drive it, generally good change oil sits, start every two weeks so. get Hollywood A-lister unless protect existing Hollywood power structure. None ever level meaningful criticism industry.

Although admit masks thing early CDC really wierd considering health departments like every asian country pushing masks really, really hard.

In fact mask wearing times pandemic actually pioneered Chinese pandemic 1911. then, no-one thought masks useful. work done Manchurian Pandemic basically made mask-wearing one standard responses pandemics (in Asia) works.

Now, know this. Dr. Fauci CDC know this. say differently?

I think political. firmly believe CDC free political pressure White House, would've said differently. 1918 flu contained all.  understand need full-on infection develop antibodies, exposure virus fragments may cause cell mediated protection, typically good enough prevent infection may help reduce severity symptoms. Basically, lack federal assistance cost CA, many states open early. easy say lets stay home work home, many including states, cities, people suffering. CA sustain unemployment benefits. federal govt gave states cities help would. Still phase 1. Even hospitals cutting wages laying people off. Covid-19 irritates lining blood vessels promotes clotting. haven’t followed details Illness it’s likely threw clot leg. Wow totally incorrect &amp; absolutely sadistic say. disturbed train thought. Dude... i'll dishes like, 3 months. let in. Stop spewing bullshit understand talking about. Although good news, it’s still like airplane people going every day. Really puts things perspective. brb... gonna see pitching Onion O:-) thats whats important- people directly helped *prevented* horrible outbreak *her* state see appreciate done. LPN Florida getting $15/hr hazard pay, deal people patients, quarantine developing symptoms, much. Obviously country still values common sense COVID-19 specifically causes too. We've known time :( seems since Americans associated mask wearing oppressed sheep able turn around anytime soon. did. beginning June San Antonio recovered active cases. averaged 20 new cases day double rate 31 days. Abbott opened bars, increased occupancy restaurants 75%, Fiesta Texas Sea World opened, water parks opened, mall opened, went shit. even putting noticeably dent human growth rate. need go back Spanish Flu, we're still fraction much recent 1968 Hong Kong Flu. Lol privelaged gym equipment.

St. Anthony’s Kindred hospitals five Largo Medical Center seven. Bayfront Health St. Petersburg 18 beds. yeet trash... sad. Poor guy, rest peace condolences family. know people commute different states time work right? 10 million people Looks like Covid really bringing best people. Umm you’re idiot lol. 

There may 13k beds free. Texas pretty large state. bed available 6 hours away doesn’t help people told isn’t space Houston. 


But okay... flu cause 130,000 deaths 5 months? treated much bigger deal seasonal flu MUCH BIGGER DEAL SEASONAL FLU.

Every possible way spelling fact exhausted. still don’t understand you’re either severely mentally impaired willfully ignorant. meh florida...  don’t say Making masks voluntary students absurd.

but gotta respect freedumbs spread disease!! Big thank mom lied vaccinated child. found years ago attempting get job state hospital. Found newborn shots &amp; stopped. asked said 'forgot'. also mention mom huge narcissist extremely emotionally abusive. 

I looked weeks try find records. state grew keeps paper files computer well. called elementary school, middle school, high school. one them. extremely bizzare experience. 

So guess saying is, even think them, always good check! sure part Texas in, North Texas there's plenty people ignoring face masks signs mouthing conspiracies. 
Like said another comment, Texas seems split middle idiocracy. Labatts. ramping testing asymptomatic people limited number tests available, workers available provide them, labs available process quickly

People realize that. bit bitter jaded. Giving asymptomatic testing acknowlegaing failure. symptomatic people take precedence asymptomatic.

Not everyone agrees. clinical diagnosis made. CT scans used found even useful PCR. argument know sick. need find isolate aren't. Nick Cordero died LA today :( “Being politicized” far passive way putting it. *Trump* politicized pandemic. No. Deaths counted labeling everything Corona COVID-19 really vascular disease. clots blood, lead sorts tissue damage. seem lapped narrative like little doggy. Good boy! Good boy!

It's odd grown adults say things like others, especially they're abjectly wrong. guess that's America now. Oh, you’re right. bad. Landing Strip ok? Really insane far Trump pushed states divide. name country even make sense now. Doesn’t surprise all. I’ve country last 20 years I’ve learned anything it’s Americans love things go boom. yeah, wondering too. Maybe something abnormal blood clotting leading tissue death leg? Thought smart school Georgia? say time? want anyone else risk lives...

""...but sorry, going to, greater-good.""

If year goes poorly, educators end getting sick dying, going see massive attrition educators education industry. Affluent districts never trouble, use money brute-force issue. What's going happen lower-socioeconomic districts going end 40, 50, 60 students classroom. they'll water requirements teacher need high-school degree teach kindergarten.

All make work year. break education system, going take very, long time fix it. Doesn’t surprise all. I’ve country last 20 years I’ve learned anything it’s Americans love things go boom. think really messes circulation. Cordero, 41, leg amputated Saturday Cedars Sinai Medical Center Los Angeles struggled blood clots ventilator ECMO machine, helps oxygenate blood.

""They put ECMO machine save life,"" Kloots said. ""It literally save life, did, thank God. sometimes repercussion putting machine cause blood issues, leg."" Invest UV resources Turns out, shithole country US along. wrong. I’d advise taking back store getting faulty one. well understood point COVID-19 cause blood clotting issues. One complications covid-19 issues blood clots, developed one blocking blood flow toes. tried putting blood thinners causing issues amputate leg. Blood clotting. looking double lung transplant next. valiant fight.

Now, widow hit hospital astronomical bills. They’re hurricane season. It’s named Covid reverse florida [Blood shame downvoted.

People getting caught rules debate opposed larger point here. Whether rule debate broken terms moving goal post point still remains...

With vaccine, problems appear immediately, long term. polio vaccine issue manufacturing seems independent rush taking place opposed could happen time manufacturing, also seems addressed. wish comment true. malicious ones absolute worst see videos of! Flu death rate 1% elderly people only. 

Covid 3% death rate ideally. 30 50% still required hospitalization cases depending health populace. US HEALTHY. 

Rip 🙏 people fixing die droves ICU done filled asking seriously, man infected back March passed away today, extrapolate that. Likely blood clot. tiny minority covid-19 patients end ICU beds, like common cold flu patients sometimes end ICU beds talking ass state number deaths Texas? illinois, illinois 11 COVID deaths yesterday. surge many weeks ago, hospitals mostly empty...nurses laid due business. county hospitalizations hit high may 6 hospital. remained zero COVID still spreading. 

Many lost jobs illinois. schools planning e-learning, 5 days week session. ironically daycares pick kids schools let down. Daycare employees probably make 33% less average teacher makes. Yet teacher still gets paid.

Chicago put field hospitals surge, stood empty. already came down. restaurants opened, stores opened...and yet deaths still declined. COVID runs nursing homes kills already verge dying, death rates start declining rapidly. 

One ‘hot spots’ illinois two people hospitalized city. COVID repeats patterns Texas different. Lockdown not, pattern occur. Sweden right beginning.  live Texas deeply deeply ashamed deeply deeply scared. Thanks, I'll give listen! Cough first. mean really play up. either spend week jacking alone day huge party contract corona way.

Why both? curcumin turmeric. Turns remove curcumin turmeric it’s still anti inflammatory! silly, think lot people following story. one early ""WTF, flu"" stories, due fact leg amputated. think thought young enough would pull through, setback setback.  learn something new everyday. would Spain it? I'm trying make excuses I've going gym long really hard disassociate gyms working out, meaning hard motivate workout effectively home. 

That said, still gone gym courtesy, pretty much feel body withering I'm anxious return. following current covid thing beginning? anecdotal evidence groups higher risk severe version COVID-19 others,” said Kon. “Overall, almost everyone develops COVID-19 mild symptoms. fact, many completely asymptotic. develop severe infection.

This comes directly article linked. easy freak anecdotes outlier cases, seems consensus almost everyone gets virus mild symptoms long lasting effects. I’ll acknowledge ranting protests off-topic, misleading link articles symptoms common statistical outliers. 

What harm letting people make choices? People choose wear masks isolate want. people want go live like pandemic started, choice so. rest recovered fully without lingering symptoms.

as now. suffered fibrosis, even ""mild fibrosis"", medium long term prognosis worsens time goes on. scarring lungs, means they're likely blood clots future everything goes that.

If SARS 2 like SARS 1 (which is), main way present future neurological issues. mean India can’t figure public toilets so... People live long time family willing pull stops try keep alive. 

I remember years ago coming across blog girlfriend documented struggles boyfriend gone fire. course two months skin grafts, surgeries, ended fighting infections fungus, ended TB bacterium lungs passed. :( Modern medicine keep 'alive' hell lot. 3000 cases Friday one county? that's crazy... Oh shit! family there! Damn shame shitshow that's Detroit Flint. one power done shit cities beyond me. numbers, live Colorado, one left leaning states around. someone lives Florida... would want live here? one worst places earth really? know that. Yes wife always positive hopeful, never seemed catch break felt like endless circle. I’m sad child, also sad hear face pulled didn’t seem likely :( lose GOP voters? NEVER. ignoring Trump, “that female governor” saved populace aware. “they could stopped it” reference Trump saying. exactly that. pretty sure means China, but, hell knows. ... particularly good example critical thinking skills. Novel viruses reach pandemic levels exceedingly rare. That's true pre-covid, hence crisis sense least 100 years. virus identified Chinese candidate pandemic nature, quick Google search show isolated years ago. Well duh think allowed strike quit country. not? federal government obviously strike dealing virus.  thought riot shields, tear gas, rubber bullets normal protest gear cops? people protesting dark?

I like handful NGs shields though. least gear consistent. still lead total cases, active cases, total deaths. could set traps, like roach motels. Take abandoned restaurant building, reopen it, put sign reads ""Covid Freedom Party"", lock dumb fuckers inside three weeks let go Lord Flies other. Leave rest us it! Really? would eat then? Plenty responsible people btw. dumb ass leadership enabling idiots go spreading.  ""The warnings came President Trump said Saturday administration made “a lot progress” combating pandemic. Speaking Independence Day event White House lawn, said country “learned put flame” coronavirus.""

Trump delusional..,, people internet credit cards lol. think people gym memberships? punishment failing comply order made declared emergency range $100,000 fines year jail time individual, staggering $10,000,000 fine corporation.

Like music ears. Hope party worth it, piece shits. Poor guy, poor wife, poor everything. 

This fucking sucks doesnt give fuck guidelines quarantines. wanted wear booty shorts body glitter. could three days test. feeling good missing party. Selfish asshole. China already made statements would help Philippines ""priority recipient"" vaccine available

Cost wise per citizen time tell guess I’m halfway thru junior year, want finish school already I’m behind semester already I’ll take whatever get know I’m definitely getting money’s worth. able smoke airplanes restaurants. Tyrants! Take look persons recent comment history. They're going nuts bunch different subreddits, seems lot comments getting removed.

Very likely someone crisis. original thoughts, repeat people said. Recently closed social circles. see people households, don’t switch regulars are. Well maybe CA, states indeed work way. I'm Alberta, every Alaskan plate see driving south I'm questioning why...would leave Alaska head mainland...wait, no... ""Banff part U.S. Get back truck keep going, care north south!""
I mean, pretty, seriously?! got mountains, parks, lakes! one trusts anymore Alaska, could you... Good point realized deleted sentence original comment. 

Hospitalizations racist I’m saying look “all cause” mortality doesn’t matter death classified Covid pneumonia. link shows states don’t deaths expected TOTAL deaths reason far year. Yes. I’m glad didn’t die without loved ones side. definitely devastating part pandemic. terms hospitals hitting capacity getting overwhelmed, yes. Deaths, probably not. two different things. People around world still debating efficacy wearing masks?

No, Americans still arguing.

If all-American field trip visit abroad way know masks work, well.... love god please wear mask looking freedom people real please wear mask hoax kill anyone please take serious. anyone definitively traced infection back grocery store? NJ hit 1 today.

only 10 states growth. ordered [this one wear 10-12 hours daily heat, almost impossible.

We also tried extremely light, well made. again, heavy hard breathe.

So searching alternative. greatly appreciate help &amp; I'm sorry immunosuppressed boat. *No no. can’t let info get out. “Kick Kung Flu” going one main talking points rallies* Mother Approved. love vaccines, pro-vaccine, way going trust one comes November 2nd. begun. going get worse since look like wearing masks practicing social distancing. 200,000 include non Florida residents? know ones may catch Florida bring back home states, rest states enjoy Florida's new #1 export. Unfortunately person position something national level says masks worn spite masks political statement him. we're SOL front. police beat, rape, murder civilians. could possibly enforce mandatory policy like that? police executed people hurricane Katrina. want set loose everyone months?! way. safe. So, ICUs clogged Covid patients, people need help heart attack, stroke, catastrophic accident, etc also cannot get treated *those* events, higher death rate well. 

Can imagine going hospital heart attack, ER ICU filled up, medical staff exhausted drained? terrifying. 3 plus months felt like pneumonia (which sense still is) damaged lungs bad needed lung transplant guess moving around lost leg disease (it's known cause blood clotting)

I mean age 41 really go general narrative strikes people 55 worse. 

Poor guy. starting life family. barely middle age. Go now. Don’t risk tooth getting worse. visited dentist twice (one emergency visit) pandemic. Healthy teeth important! Tate Tate. overhear coworkers friends endorsing nonsense, speak out—especially protest(in Hattiesburg, rare see anyone without mask). I’m sure surveillance cameras police state verify this, guv must bidding master. make mistake, signing flag legislation endorsement civil rights BLM, denunciation “the lost cause,” attempt cool fervor voting November. Please think anything material happen better lives black people, poor people, marginalized group, unless stay active bringing new leadership November. dark souls segregationist politicians change. say... Women led nations shown handle coronavirus crisis well. Take look new zealand's prime minister. 0 2 cases day. Germany's chancellor made coronavirus testing available everyone well taiwan. Michigan's Governer Whitmer handled protests covid crisis well. healthcare workers michigan really respect her. Georgia (at least said were) shut lot testing sites holiday weekend others reduced hours I'm trying figure still managed post big number. Since federal drug prohibition law built Commerce clause Constitution, States legalizing weed also ""bypassing constitution"". People seems fine that. virus gets hands (even sick person) put hands. wipe nose, cough sneeze hand. 

If sanitize, hands clean next time expose virus. Hopefully people keep hands face 5 minutes buying Cab Sauv! Plenty medical journals saying case. even true, even close main reason number severe cases. good description. Well said, mate. Except one believe it. least make kind significant change. looking it, doc could tell want biopsy. way go unless absolutely necessary. Two classes gonna remote five far. I'm glad I'm paying tuition (grad school) know would go back. Hope everyone costume picked character wears mask!

We've consistently indoor trick treat (malls, etc) past several years due really little ones also weather here. Last Halloween snowing. I'm guessing indoor trick treat gonna question year, unfortunately. Newsest stands alone know either. guys asked virus that, trying illustrate bad virus be.  *Mississippi* offer. 20 dollar lap dance ronas side prefer stick scientific publication. reqd it? charged public endangerment day court. agree points made, think university try find balance giving students education also freedom leisure. Imagine able work local union get college degree? definitely hard since relies time money, options would best.

But again, formal education still something necessary. show accredited, critical thinking skills, etc. cannot internet exist. opinion always matter, especially local elections. It’s uncommon see local primary elections 20% participation funding bills may decide fate public library something else significant. voting you’re getting 5x voice heard. Imagine convince friends vote snowballs.

Thanks voting, hope keep finding reason so. Sure, once, opportunity starve beast CANT let record foreign students"" cover (although Americans want take gap year undermine quality education foreign enrollees dump 60k US education system per head stay overseas wherever go ""overpriced university Phoenix"" year......that's cool me? gap year means get come back after, like schools double admissions one year plug hole - room everyone year gap year students return. boyfriend going Arkansas philly see family got new niece. Im furious him. Im high risk doesnt get quarantine gets back house. drives nuts, told needs think plan even though begging go. problem earth South South East Asia mostly got away Christmas tourism season. like two regions immune considering bad gotten winter season ended.

Whatever spread pre-december China strain spread Europe post CNY. know people reinfected yet, otherwise we'd seeing many reports. reports come debunked extent. I'm sure ever left ICU. ""Will need bilateral lung transplant recovers"" translated medical specialties 'imma pretty surprised live' says ""Brazil highest number recovered people, 1 million, however US still country infected people"". Trump's strategy get pay along keep friend thoughts!! Wishing friends good health. Stay safe!! 

And trust me, definitely told hes stupid!!! Lol I’d love live money didn’t work. sounds like incredibly strong person. Good luck dude, congrats incoming kiddo. got this! Thats spinoff series need Please don’t ruin us, good thing going  Both. hotspot, stay hell away states. they're running out.. can't test ""for asking"" anymore. hate American healthcare. honestly sound really stressed out, call friend relative tell what's mind. constantly new strains. Bought fuckton fireworks set middle nowhere sister, kid, ex husband. welcome show, Evant. Please explain position masks... I’m sincerely curious.  Welcome world can't tell joking not... try kn95 masks still available websites, according cdc function n95 masks. make sure fits right try get seal outside air. rise faster soon. Lagging indicator fewer ICUs, packed hospitals make healthy recoveries. Dont understand... either UK+US leader coincidently idiots., planning something, strategy.... god dammed calculations... people stupid. Civil rights movement drunken parties   Yes well aware health care comes tax dollars. Canadians blind think tooth fairy like entity delivers money 

If making vaccination cost every citizen rich poor tax dollars get allocated, 100% ok Omg gut-wrenching. scariest part unpredictability virus. get you’ll probably fight eventually, don’t. die. clue fate family members would fall into. 
My mom now. high-risk everything could protect herself. Fortunately far (about 10 days) feeling better originally keep telling lmk starts feeling worse all. It’s frightening. Never extubated, working on. woke medically induced coma month half ago, never made ICU. still weak battling lingering lung infections virus. could communicate looking yes no. But, week two ago least lifted visitation restrictions able go visit hold hand. there's silver lining least held long enough could surrounded family say goodbye FaceTime. fucking devastating. I'm proud seriously taken here, man strange. got car still taking bus weeks everything getting worse. announcements virus social distancing kept playing PA. ""Welcome City 17"" Half Life vibe. 

All said, want anywhere else whole thing. coming back definitely count walking transit. stick everyone else wear damned mask, lol.  Great news. Americans thinking trying cross border: stay fuck away. want here. Major League Soccer re-starts season week. I'm excited! Ha...one friends works vet posted employer: lot people acting like complete jerks pandemic boss calls out. don’t know holy shit wiki article says amputate right leg 820,000 Definitely comprehensive lockdown. Every time come people saying streets would littered millions dead day Oof, feelings get hurt? feel insecure education? I’m sure fully grasp concept racism. Combating racism involves identifying unique challenges specific racial groups facing addressing society. Black people treated like whites Asians. 

Being “color-blind” ignore systemic racism.

We could start removing corporations healthcare prison systems.

I would say things longer institutionalized someone’s race doesn’t directly relate educational attainment wealth.

White people (and Asians certain extent) given handouts federal government decades. ability grandparents get mortgage buy house directly impacted achievement.

Also, home state (Oregon) funding public schools determined property tax district. Resulting disproportionate funding schools rich neighborhoods (predominantly white Asian) poor neighborhoods (predominantly black Hispanic). Public schools funded uniformly, regardless neighborhood occupy. 

The police smallest part issue. idea go fixing issue least try. much worse. charts showing viral growth new hotspots stunning. exponential uphill climb. first wave pretty much NYC epicenter. least four giant epicenters FL, TX, AZ, CA, others coming rear. there’s good ole ‘Merica 50% positive results? mean every 10 people get test, 5 positive? that’s true that’s charts. Seems like highest percent seen anywhere else around 10-15%? Maybe memory wrong? country humanity great things? Hello!! puds come from? someone daft get fucked existence? why? type conditioning didn’t get youngster something? absent day told everyone like Mikey mouse face facts? country dead slave over. That’s IT. that’s coming is: 

Death

Suffering
Mass murder
Starvation 
Rape

That IT. hope. humanity. We've exhausted national testing ability week. nasal swabs reagents, machines already exist.

Why people continue hallucinate particular government going sufficient quality proper distribution hundreds millions people injection?

The wealthy certainly get it. Corporations thousands doses delivered headquarters.

But ""essential workers"" ? Good luck that.

Try get testing appointment tomorrow, dare yah. imagine vax appointment.

On positive side anti-vaxers finally good leaving want it. cheaper burn hospital records kept. even relevant? anything? Yeah, saw it. Utter embarrassment. going comment, sounds like questionable person around. Probably areas measles outbreaks. blame one bit. keep eye shoulder. solution still trying cope fundamental problem every aspect modern society. incompatible action needed prevent catastrophe. Large restructuring society necessary humans don’t like change norms many absolutely refuse change major aspects lives everything work food random stuff consume needs reworked. 

Electric vehicles band aid. ignores much energy resources use every day function type society.

I wonder even enough recourse battery materials provide electric cars everyone world? Developing nations want cant carbon emitting fuels use. them? 

I agree cars become necessary survival many parts world doesn’t mean solution hoping impossible keep system going. underlying conditions?  areas measles outbreaks. 50% people survive 5 years lung transplant, numbers keep going that, unfortunately. long-term prognosis sadly particularly good. Fuck FEMA fuck Mayor Yes no. people long gone. forgot. I've always concerned virus outbreaks never imagined could actually happen widespread level. Society needs protocols institutionalized sure.  one annoying memes whole sub. simply true. Especially long since almost testing writing people pneumonia flu deaths ever wake up? I'm sure conscious leg amputation. poor body assault months, suspect unconsciousness protected aware it. Vaccines typically take decade develop test... work all. 

It hasn’t 6 full months genetic sequencing COVID. see vaccine 2020, it’s rushing. review results search seem several good online indepth reviews sample courses. Yup, keep hearing. think issue. awarded man computer screen award . Yes could possibly consequences even close 30k deaths. 

Next weeks telling. time, big motor companies (Ford, GMC, etc.) lobbied federal, state, local governments destroy underfund public transit systems (the death streetcar) build huge interstate highways straight city centers give suburbanites easy access workplaces city centers. Eventually, workplaces also moved suburbia, creating ""edge cities"" sapped wealth density urban core could used revitalize public transit.

Wowww, know American cities experienced quite combination factors led death public transit rise automobile. turn shaped landscape US way difficult rekindle public transit flame economically sustainable way outside largest cities, even political exists

Very interesting can't believe fast outbreak turned nothing absolute shit storm. really hope contained. anti-lockdown protests big deal all, sides. Need test adverse reaction, takes months. Nobody wants vaccinate population find causes hypersensitivity non-negligible percentage people kill tens thousands more. Going number tests ~2 weeks ago, labs 80,000 tests process right now. 40% today's confirmed positives tests done week ago. We're right around 20-21% overall positive mark right (PCR &amp; serology positives comingled AZ's data). Since serology positive rate ~3%, we're probably around 25% PCR tests. Bruh dumb keep glucose tablets gel you? should! They're best way rapidly raise low blood sugar. scary thing witness! endless requests contractor recommendations lost pets read ballet dancer lost 10lbs performance.

Also governor one racist states union many people grieving today. feel like piece many us fighting family. heart broken... looked love much love proud son. Life bummer. states take weeks report deaths. 95 degree weather would make non starter quite states someone test board ship test negative let leave already quarantined 14 days. massive protests NYC happening almost every day lack massive covid spike?

Plenty 20-30 year olds tv saying issue. interviewing people street hitting bars one young person another saying ""I care"" IKR, even his/her username rip something else, joke never got real answer Basically for. spread things facts were. would hesitate make bold policy based single small study preponderance evidence informs us covid19 incredibly infectious asymptomatic cases could responsible half transmission. children unable meaningfully transmit virus adults other, would need see far far definitive data corroboration putting faith would rather miraculous providence. virologist, sincerely thank great post. reading rabbit hole almost lose mind. science, specifically virology, use adenovirus based vaccine delivery platforms MUCH general public really care point time. Like, massively wide spread used, incredibly well understood, pointed stable humans products. 'problem' full picture available click bait news article, ton details matter molecular level something news going waste time covering. Death rates tend lag behind infection case count due fact infected people usually die instantly.

So might look low might higher 2 2 weeks. ""Recovered"" nonsense stat many places (including U.S. states) track it. one outside tiny island countries like Iceland right, test patient twice, two negatives meaning ""recovered."" Eh like mask feel like sexy ninja. got twin crackhead mayor Toronto something still. suburbs reelected him. Really why? I’m process leaving. gone last year half coming back help parents. hate Yeah, go mostly Virginia Mason Seattle since bought hospital Yakima unless patient relationship another hospital system (like transplant patient lives Yakima normally goes Swedish transplant care). US separated 2 big oceans two weak af neighbours big ass army. one anything. Horrible. horrible. Doug mandate masks, fact refused so. Betting number deaths now, we? Nope. pay $10, pay $20, office required eat difference. protests definitely caused virus spread LA. Garcetti admitted much. two big protest locations. Hollywood Blvd dtla. get people drive neighborhoods. carpooled people took public transport. Hollywood protest packed. everyone wearing mask. much proven young kids learn well screen

In decades Also homeschool kids may goods test much lacking social side.

And know how?

LOL. Come man. ridiculous. numbers success show better results.

I know fantasy public school think kids attend days that.  Denial age limit family went hell back.

I hope peace God... don’t even know say family. People like live like 1 hour town even means spending least 2 hours day commute slightly larger house.

Ok, cultural piece information missing!!!!!!!!!! people lack food prefer live multistore buildings public transportation, since cheaper? Except California, seems completely fucked housing, mean. prefer live expensive houses expensive cars afford food? still understand. I'm sure nothing protests weeks ago right? let’s forget graduating med school still young (27-ish, didn’t take break education since graduating high school). ability pass National Board Exams guarantee student developed empathy, seems real problem fighting spread Covid-19. Belize. One brought vivid him. read late last year employer...HIPAA laws generally apply businesses regards employee health info. 
Not lawyer, take grain salt. Also, restaurant employee tests positive Hepatitis, makes news here. grey area sure. Whose comment(s) referring to? Source events? Believes conspiracy videos YouTube.  Calls us sheep. OK buddy. aren’t wrong you’re gonna get downvoted “murica bad” Aren’t places hang businesses? will, way. Heck still getting hair cut illegal. places opened up, people used gathering homes sheds bars restaurants still suffering. public pool may closed, many 10 kids swim given day. U don’t need business gather. Saw photo bridge backed cars heading feeling wouldn’t good. imagine mess full freedumb people say easily get workout home gym never seriously lifted weights gym.

Most people can’t get equivalent home.

It doesn’t matter, though. Going gym right would stupid, would endanger (at least) health others lives. I’ve fantasizing day 20 years now; sitting dock drinking Tecate reading twitter son tries get outboard motor running little boat take young family water little bay somewhere nice.

I see tweet Bill Gates: “COVID-19 become 4th infectious disease history become completely eradicated.”

I hit like go help motor. Great news!! fine,and 2 week suspension...etc......about time people standing form this!!! Cities US exploded population unique time Americans car technology wealth necessary car. Thanks American dominance global market WWII transition massive amounts war materiel factories factories produced civilian goods (e.g: cars tanks), cars uniquely affordable American middle class (which predominantly white, race relations topic another post). such, massive automotive centric suburbs constructed new families GIs returning home war cash spend house car would necessary get house anywhere useful. Around time, big motor companies (Ford, GMC, etc.) lobbied federal, state, local governments destroy underfund public transit systems (the death streetcar) build huge interstate highways straight city centers give suburbanites easy access workplaces city centers. Eventually, workplaces also moved suburbia, creating ""edge cities"" sapped wealth density urban core could used revitalize public transit.

TL;DR: American cities experienced quite combination factors led death public transit rise automobile. turn shaped landscape US way difficult rekindle public transit flame economically sustainable way outside largest cities, even political exists I'm wondering graph would look like ethnic densities based population totals &amp; compare two. I'm wondering virus affecting specific races concentrated one area? area hot spot? noticed, example, Washington predominantly white deaths, majority white races. Okay bars, gyms, restaurants movie theaters nothing it? Lol. Protesting caused spike yet dc, chicago, Minneapolis nyc dont similar spike huge protest? Like said course spreading happen nothing compared reopening early. governor Texas regrets opening bars. doubt, rapid death highs.

TOTAL, we’re almost 3M confirmed cases COVID US, estimated true case count ~20M (we really idea). given flu season, estimated flu case count 9M 49M. Despite efforts it, still COVID still early spread, we’re seeing huge death toll. 

New York City population ~8.4M. ~23K deaths attributed COVID New York City. 

Approximately 1 365 New York City residents recorded dead outbreak. 1 365 confirmed presumed infected, 1 365 residents. That’s including “pneumonia deaths” deaths otherwise missed. reflective toll COVID takes person survive either. 

The rest country still “first wave.” want better idea dangerous COVID is, look New York City. Multiple ICUs south hitting capacity Arizona already putting triage policies. Coronavirus specifically refer one new virus emerged late 2019. family viruses, also includes SARS virus, MERS virus, handful viruses collective cause large percent diseases grouped name 'the common cold'. isn’t ccp though it?

I’m saying ccp. I’m saying people agree (including many government officials) China hasn’t honest outbreak, least beginning. actually trust say first confirmed case early december? I’m saying didn’t start China

That’s headline/article seems suggest here, people comments seems somewhat convinced.

It doesn’t make sense wouldn’t China though. agree cannot prove anything, come somewhere else, China first one notice it? Wouldn’t original place start see outbreak China? 

Hey maybe I’m wrong. It’s difficult see originating elsewhere read story 30 minutes ago Franklin county cases. They're definitely reporting. supposed fly ft Myers week visit grandparents. bad idea? distance safe? Looks like upstanding establishment Well probably small bitter.

Just stranger's opinion though.

What load shit.  US Government could taken steps, due national emergency, ban sale N95 similar PPE consumers, **while time promoting mask-wearing homemade mask creation.**

One thing people don’t mention nursing home patient hospital needs two negative tests discharged. test every 48 hours. people sit hospital 2 months test positive again. likely adding cases.

Its encouraging death rates stagnating declining areas, even though cases skyrocketing. test 6x much initial months naturally uncovering lots cases.

ICU capacity quite fluid. given hospital easily convert units ICUs need be. Hospitals country cross training staff work ICU since started. Patients also hang ICU abundance caution longer need to, bed needed types patients rotated step unit.

I think it’s fair say hospitals want full. Two months ago empty laying direct care staff, encouraging early retirement, offering nurses summer off.

Nah agree. people would initially going planets star systems would best, brightest, community oriented people have. would indoctrinate children, new generations born new places, importance things.

The issue humanity much culture. Humanity perfect, reason US failing terribly handling Covid-19 individualistic culture fuck everyone else. mean look Japan South Korea see different cultures handled this. Individualism benefits competition, personally think required innovation (and would argue even inhibit it.)

""I can't truthful, otherwise i'd replaced total yes man"" 

Fauci briefings long time, trump already took out. 

Well months prepare worse stage than, before. 

Fauci's lying took chance pay off. I’m sure understand point here. Median means half values value rest less value. statistics, generally use median performing non parametric analysis. 

Regardless, think data segmented age group location (among variables) order better model rather state median 12. also curious source, found small sample study Minnesota showing median 11.5 days. live can't get appointment test least week results taking also least week. 
Kinda defeats purpose Yeah that’s b protesting 😂 reopen schools, teachers students die car accidents. Well see, Canada didn’t tens millions protestors social distancing wearing masks. saying reason spikes certainly contributed that’s undeniable they're ships much longer, repopulation may start soon. ;-) PR stunt keep masses bay

India new China less power less influence tho 

Now bring votes patriotic shits Cheaper go bankrupt. least option us want it. Obviously think us would pounce opportunity get vaccine. Michigander here. think done good job, unfortunately many people know hate simply goes everything trump says. quite scary listening relatives talk much hate her. scientifically, nothing blame. finding source ready next time. understand middle ground likely happen, result lot deaths states unfortunately.

Last checked two active cases dorms. doubt lot bruins getting infected, campus not. I'm glad majority classes upcoming year online. That's nice dream, however I'm sure relegated staff quarters food drink rationed fancy. ones repopulate earth Hi there, already posted Reposts removed. That’s concern though, trials abbreviated results inaccurate crowded protests, sure let’s ignore part ;) Really hope two different fronts. One, lot smart people working vaccines, already pre-production. far, lot good news front terms blowing away records implemented vaccine. difficult argue experts working vaccines terms predictions.

The front terms surviving virus itself. virus amateur-level test. Sure, we've failed... boy failed, despite stupidly we've reacted, we're seeing lot people surviving infected.

The governments (federal, state, local) could throw hands tell us we're own, dealing apocalypse. would bad, bad, I'm suggesting (just opposite), virus level cause complete breakdown infrastructure.

30% cases already recovered 883,590, take account unknown cases people infected symptoms significant enough tested counted case.

Infections skyrocketing, really tragic. However, result lot stupid people taking risks seeing consequences. lot people impacted yet they're taking risks. impact becomes real them, many become cautious.

To clear, need take precautions increase steps mitigating spread including closing things down, wearing masks, social distancing, etc..., achieve lower number infections consequences. Regardless that, infrastructure ability survive society still survive covid, probably won’t survive that.

My wife going survive COVID. taking risks. stay home. Nobody comes in. go hike empty trails. Food delivered cook ourselves. Everything coming house disinfected.

As far failure infrastructure... planned well. 1-2 year supply need we're maintaining, certainly end consuming donating over.

I'm saying someone started planning January. cautious I've top ""preppier"" whatever, I'm saying I'm seeing signs may light end tunnel pretty soon, there's high confidence tunnel collapse.

**TL;DR: Hang there, keep following best practices staying safe!** they're two weeks away already late. gonna get rough. Well like business needs pay rent employees sleeping moment, I'm sure food close garbage point. like they're eating actual cruise level meals right now. They're probably living canned food. If, recently claimed, virus transmissible aerosol, practical purposes safe distance. jfc, Phoenix rockin *25%* positive rate PCR tests? fuuuck. getting data? read tonight Toronto new cases today. even seem plausible? know someone Nova Scotia, cannot come back yet. Good thing family there.  looking (tons of) colleges decade ago, *had* attend consecutively wanted keep financial aid. 

Maybe schools allow taking year off? ones looked northeast certainly didn’t. mean, *allowed it*, you’d disqualified financial aid. 

So unless they’re wealthy paying pocket, can’t imagine many college students saying “fuck it, I’ll take year off.” Ok?

What gave random need dick stranger?

It’s stupid joke yes - you? Yeah wouldn’t want talk party well. seem like grew putting others perk ego people rather leave party knowing you’re there.

Anyways. 

Have great night. you’re saying true. say reinfection possible declaratively? Please check [what posted elsewhere discourse that’s ensued. People failing realize healthy public discourse, entitled opinions, facts!

Lockdowns could answer done right. Unfortunately right would meant going sacred Constitution. mean, maybe bringing back sports Covid spiking good idea.  good point! Yes, I've heard, things used different regarding breaks &amp; smoking. right nurses, makes upset hospitals understaff point breaks always possible :-( Let cross, put cages. Pre-COVID19 universities distance learning added online learning infrastructure fee. expensive person courses. Rude also inaccurate. Youre probably seeing ignorance then. Live southbay area sure, people wearing masks *in public*, gatherings almost certainly reasons things jumping much been. say move close indoor dining etc pointless, doubt COVID-19 spreading significantly places first place. People parties without masks everywhere every single day county, likely elsewhere. Profit people. American way.  ask you’ve around large groups people.  Link this? guy fought fought. Everyone who’s following sub since beginning aware arc. Rest Peace, man. Devastating family.

That people can’t bothered wear fucking mask really pisses end. vaccine cited go human trials? seems would extremely irresponsible gone thought people might want read NY Times obituary. I’ll get archive link too.  Ohhhh politico op ed Biden 'moving left' M4A said mid march (COVID) he'd veto it? Woah! OK! Totally changing stance this! see light now, thanks

Too bad DNC actively fought Sanders two separate campaigns, actively propped Trump via HRC's pied piper strategy, vote ""veto m4a"" ""i want kids grow racial jungle"" "" shoot criminals leg"" ""poor kids smart white kids"" ""if vote ain't black"" Biden remove trump (which, sadly, anyways)

Yes, politically naive. trying mean, quicker end bullshit political naive posturing quicker make real change Screw off. didn’t even shouldn’t died. I’m tired morons posting shit like every time someone dies covid-19. It’s like want prexisting condition justify death. Sad. man. stupid control number people there... establishment I've technically lost weight, that's stopped weightlifting started drinking more... silver lining I'm totally ready lean bulk over! husband extreme homebodies would honestly heaven poor two year old. I'm best get safer outdoor settings I'm getting increasingly worried social development. needs around kids learning interact really think might mildly impacted life social deprivation crucial early childhood window.

It sucks bad. Yes, two weeks thing dead two weeks. Seriously though following everything takes way longer happen two weeks. stop crazy kids movie Friday 😀

(Looking video clip. memory bench rusty though...) Ah, 1%er. Good hear things going well you. rest world happy privileged life working well. waiting get coughed find out?  People disabilities also spreading virus. really can't wear mask, stay home. End short sad story. need stop Florida first could let people like judgy fucking asshole.

Asymptomatic people getting tested unprecedented levels explains lot surge reported cases Happened FIL April. say goodbye video chat. Still funeral. Also true Yes. dangerous Trump believes intuition instead science. Maybe get Americans donate pay That's fucking horrible... I'm little confused, covid 19 lead leg amputations? Exactly.  rate stabilizes would take 23 years US get it. That's assume like measles.... not.

You can't become immune... (for sustainable period). vaccine would last 6 12 months (to generous). 

I'm baffled many lack type understanding. rushed reopen? come leg amputated? I've never heard covid before. Ha, that's far. seriously, drugs alcohol often underestimated huge factor many social criminal problems. audibly said ""oh no"" saw this. 

I work live theater ran lot circles. caught COVID around time cannot help wonder caught place time -- caught closing show theater exposed late February. 

Regardless, devastating. month ago, theater announced we're closed fall 2021 (this announced spikes started happening nation-wide); filmed live-performances, small audiences -- nothing (and maybe longer).

I shocked happy we're so, even unemployed time being. think caution watching condition decline. 

I'm sorry suffered much passed -- amputations, treatments. Horrible. Sounds like Iowa too. Good, availability smart people. Knuckle draggers gonna drag knuckles. Yes, exact fucking time that. Covidiots understand *almost* every protestor even goddamned rioters wearing masks *and* gloves cases *still* maintaining distance whenever possible. Covidiots going bars, restaurants, theme parks, churches, back yard cookouts taking *zero* fucking precautions spreading Covid-19 like wildfire. turn around whine protestors spreading ""global hoax"" aimed taking Dear Cult Leader. persecution complex lethal absolutely self-inflicted &amp; self-fulfilling. 

Trump Jim Jones-ing cult members sadder Old Yeller. Yeah, believe avenues deserve looked at. meant find strange wheeling fella again. Particularly time UK might need somewhere point people's anger coming weeks. sorry loss. wish people cared one another. can't force believe numbers details COVID-19, least could live normally without sordid things like clubbing partying. Prima facie, lot pneumonia deaths untested/underreported Covid deaths. also important note ICU capacity due staffing due physical rooms. hospital ER patients often held day shift another nurse take 1:1 said true, fuck graph make believe false narrative! shit last test got negative. given months gotten sick. would bigger story still positive point. Prior lockdown, everything pretty fast-paced family things super structured scheduled far advance. admit one thing enjoying everything slowed bit opportunity spend quality time two young kids. That’s silver lining this. Tell think happens ICUs reach capacity. still get stared coughing. opposite. started trying lose weight January, used fact covid fucks obese people motivation continue. 65 pounds since January, 35 go! feel pain, I'd say - think situation person AIDS sex without condom, aggravated must wear condom, since feel nice.. contend mask-wearing situation. 

It seems anti-freedom one perspective. perspective preserving safety others. Consider someone gave AIDS avoid temporary personal inconvenience. Imagine that, understand logic behind mask mandate. That's disgusting. Mad respect athletes. Reminds MMA they're trying make weight. go extreme measures takes toll bodies. Small business? daughter works Target told to, “attempt enforce” mask mandate shoppers made threats violence employees. Disgusting - employees still need work, yet faced violence possible exposure. wrong people? you’re talking fact lockdowns aren’t answer, yes half country refuses listen science doomers keep pushing narrative lost mom COVID. contact ambulance took away, put ventilator fairly soon got hospital sedated that, sedated died. enjoying it. Sure, want old life back, I'm going feel bad staying safe home. Maybe time reevaluate way go jobs significant portion people forced homes pandemic still feel happier rat race. scientists directly involved GoF research. Peter Daszak literally talked engineering infectious bat viruses last December. Ralph Beric supported GoF research helped wuhan lab creating chimeric Coronavirus 2015. Scientists conflict interest raised questions lab leak scenario. 

US literally outsourced GoF research wuhan lab via Ecohealth alliance. US research enhancing SARS/MERS/avian flu 2014 they'd banned safety issues. virus result GoF experiment leaked lab, can't see US British intelligence communities (and extension governments) would lie people? think people die lung issues, clot issues brain issues.

This virus awful seems able attack anyplace blood circulates including blood vessels. Thats fine make fines least $300 think ""poor writing"" refer antibodies test ""immunity testing"". Given amount immunity antibodies confer still studied. Also research shown many infected show rapid drop antibodies, may illustrate true infection rate.

Still worth though. seeing weeks ago medical professionals preaching masks anything. read that, actual numbers people long term consequences ? People know got virus fine now, know first hand cases like this, wondering 10÷, 1÷, 0.1÷. like yes kids died virus, marginal Dude, Florida's death rate ever catch New Jersey's. NJ NY got absolutely rekt. Murphy ordered infected people nursing homes like Cuomo, like Cuomo thousands thousands vulnerable old people died. he's giving advice. Lol. 


Both NJ NY 10 times death rate Florida. NJ 23 deaths today 29. 25% deaths almost three times population. Plus, bunch old people living here. fortunate get powerblocks someone selling it’s life saver Money. It’s quite possible testing federal government got behind funded it. universities could even testing geared it. Testing isn’t difficult complicated do. mixed feelings this. problem negative test equal negative infection. It’s hard find sensitivities PCRs recurring number see 70% nasopharyngeal swab. 
So roughly you’re swabbing 10 people guaranteed covid, 3 negative. cases community go up, care positivity rate. go 5% 25%, don’t need know absolute infection numbers know there’s huge uptick community. ideal world, swab people 
- symptomatic risk live/work risk. 
- symptomatic healthy
- there’s plenty tests swab close exposures 

But everyone else low risk exposures nonspecific symptoms quarantine week

Btw, worth saying India actually got *incredibly* lightly virus. deaths per capita tiny compared global average (14 per million India, 69 per million worldwide). big numbers population bigger continents.

If Britain (definitely tropical) size India, would close million deaths. India 20,000. Ok, I'm arguing come China. answering points.

""why China first one notice it?""

China actually robust tracing system types outbreaks, probably countries. reason things stand good chance come China. mean did, mean didn't. fact is, become clear countries earlier first realised, shows able recognize was. tricky bugger able pretend regular flu/pneumonia. 

The fact wuhan large outbreak first makes lean towards starting nearby. Although add that, announced wuhan mass panic followed undoubtedly made spread super fast.

Basically 6 months built upon 2 decades hard work hopefully figured out. Londoner here, too.

On street, much mask use (though, busy street keep 6 feet other, bad). live suburbs go 3.5km night time walk, wear mask. people street, cross side walk side street give sidewalk. Everyone seems good live.

In stores, I'd say 50-60% mask usage grocery stores Walmarts.

Don’t want guy want everyone know Corona virus related stuff free right RE: death rates 
Death rates low sickness incubating. Deaths tend happen 3 weeks day infection. rough numbers, people feel symptoms around day 7, assuming get tested feel sick, looking death occurring 2 weeks counted sick. 

Death rates also much lower hospitals still able cope. moment hospitals overflow, numbers start multiplying. Texas says 10 days away overflowing.

On positive note, getting better treatment, since we've half year learn grow. Ideally, even bad circumstances death rates would better happened NY months back. Plus also policy means slow things down. 

So hospitals get overcrowded, less stupid states go temporary lockdowns. Or, know requires people much smarter us, people could wear masks reduce infection rates naturally without forced lockdowns. time looks like favor lockdowns. Many refused wear though, would simply forget. think it’s less ingrained us now. It’s years I’ve car somebody refusing wear one. pretty sure last person rode wouldn’t wear seatbelt killed car accident along pregnant girlfriend 2005. weren’t wearing seatbelts, course.

Combating racism involves identifying unique challenges specific racial groups facing addressing society. Black people treated like whites Asians. 

I think astute noticing pointing difference concepts racism. understand correctly, definition racism, race-specific changes need happen groups elevate place. However, definition racism, everyone begins square plays rules. Thus, affirmative action no. Something like equal school funding yes. (no idea isn't. need read 
 would say things longer institutionalized someone’s race doesn’t directly relate educational attainment wealth. 

Basically understand ""there institutionalized racism long black people get number diplomas make income level races"".

And one separate correlation causation? indians (people india) among wealthiest races US. Part (on average) highly educated (the ones immigrate over) highly education-focused work extremely hard. Since correlated race, ability grandparents get mortgage buy house directly impacted achievement. 

Yes. generational passing-on-of-things there, stand atop 3 generations ""build next generation"" (and hoping fuck chain) yeah. recognize critical is. education achievement beaten us (literally last two generations), great personal sacrifices made reach increasing levels achievement financial security.

I recognize black people are, comparison, kind fucked aspect (starting little inter-generational accrual game). tell this: results equal one side sacrifices another? father grandfather sacrifice nothing? Or, compare one person's effort/sacrifice another determining ""worthy"" get additional help advance? keep freeloaders? And, can't, entirely based race (not talent effort), regardless individuals' characteristic, would anyone buy there's cost benefit? 

After all, reason anyone strives anything literally rise masses produce inequality. (but fair system).

Milwaukee Bucks one three teams given good chance winning NBA 2019-20 title shut practice facility 25 days season re-convenes. facility opened. There's rub. Perhaps season played Orlando, one weaker teams emerge victorious, lucked fewest positive tests. case, good omen--these guys need get playing shape. needs arrested. cruel inhumane behavior! Yes tweaking model provide entirely different outcome. It’s difficult abuse ML system like this. hope wife well! Pharmacy strong voice rly get much PPE unfortunately. Every time went covid unit, awful feeling realizing I've wearing mask week everyone else face shields N95s. Completely agree. many colleagues chronic health conditions, immunocompromised spouse child - one best teacher buddies primary caregiver father, undergoing chemotherapy. takes COVID home, supposed live knowledge increased father’s suffering hastened death? 

There much galls me, decision require students wear masks idiotic parents complain unconscionable. Yeah like “they got blowjobs reports now??” *clicks link* best buy fear ain't dying it, think would survive seeing low % die it. Rather fear fucking lungs part body. Like happened Broadway actor. despite death rate getting better. I'm still cautious infections getting high Meanwhile Florida we're running ICU beds available statewide. counties near zero available beds. surprised someone party helped make sure listen appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  Yeah, I’ll make prediction right now, gonna big spike covid 19 everywhere America, 2 weeks. 

Source: 4th July Outcomes vs. busy work. Damn. Didnt realize old. cases individuals harassing employees mask rules cases mask requirement imposed business, government.

""That's law""? Neither masks states/counties, thick fuck. Yeah got pepper gel too. Looking getting gun although ccw doesn’t seem likely reside . Stay safe friend . Health wealth, best luck finding work, onwards upwards Masks aren’t even mandatory lot US. It’s individual states cities make rules. Good thing ""sleezy orange 3rd rate huckster born silver spoon"" ""doddering career politician 'good friends' pro-segregation Dixiecrats time fought donors people every opportunity"" lined helm highest office next 4 years. people could follow basic rules listen experts could emerged lockdowns may fine. conclusive proof people cannot trusted act responsibly, treat everyone like children. 

The worst case scenario isnt continued infections immunity- worst case scenario complete collapse healthcare across entire cities weeks time. ramifications orders magnitude worse covid death toll would been. Oh god, 5?! flabbergasted heard 4. That’s genuinely terrifying. cannot imagine stressful was. A, there's delay deaths month diagnosis death. B, they're intentionally underreporting thousands COVID deaths labeling pneumonia etc. fishy. Scientists finding better treatments, effective medicines.  as? Tht shit's coming unless full-on revolution. US *very* easily distracted. r/COVID19Resistance Remindme ! 2 weeks see. live latin america. big city 13 million people. like, flithy rich people cars. people use buses poor people use train. fact, covid going big country going bus slum another slum. guess got irrationally angry saw americans cars complaining enough eat. think understand better. Thank you!!! ask drug charges are. [There racial bias drug laws system skews minorities getting trouble, use system built put away quickly effectively, use labor skills prison save lives *and property rich people*, letting out, society excludes jobs use skills built prison earned 5 dollars day for. 

... well fuck man. would do? often wonder people would placed situations men. decisions would make. used make little profit seats huge profit selling reward miles companies, turn use promotions. I'm gonna guess side business cratered even harder actual seat selling part. Yes, expect office workers ability remotely work continue work remotely longer Sept. keep virus contained, otherwise, open floodgates, Go Train / Union epicenter. terrible happening. Indian, remember encountering incidents hate 9/11 scary. . lied people-for reason- we're wondering people trust him? decreasing precautions... think public universities would prefer online education fall even spring. need state cover budget shortfall.. Set safe socializing bubbles families take seriously do, maybe families antibodies. No. don’t think anyone anything don’t want do/isn’t best interest comes creating life. That’s point. It’s abortion one options people often leave conversation. science it’s also surveillance. I’m OK sort thing. potential abuse tremendous it’s worth it. Believe me. Mate, grew abject poverty too, single mum. kid school TV watch, even paper read. also kid school almost always stayed behind school picking rubbish keep occupied everybody else class went school trips. know like.

The Governments around world passed law freeze rents evictions everybody (homes businesses) pandemic.

About rationing: saying grandparents great-grandparents ration last Great Depression also last Great War. found way survive, died hunger illness, even lead-poisoning (last bit - really funny, know).

There's long-life powdered milk, could make bread to, there's biscuits munch on. point is, reduce amount eat, know want go back whatever going called ""normal"" ends.

If Governments given everyone stimulus cheques get enough long-life food last 40 days, locked everything tight would now.

Does anyone feel this? guess easier blame protests listen data. course comes guy won’t wear mask.  Hicks also derided social media critics “liberal Marxist parasites,” adding, “As traditional American, enemy.” 

&amp;#x200B;

Uh, OK... What’s 1% 3M? 🤔 Since death rate plummeting kids 19-22--i.e., exactly vulnerable group--these kids likely safer school, exponential growth not. origial droplets. Coronavirus airbone. 'We're 100% sure this."" 

The article listed said Lidia Morawska, professor atmospheric sciences environmental engineering Queensland University Technology Brisbane one scientists wrote “We 100 per cent sure this,” told AAP.

What misunderstood? regular ICU beds capacity, they’ve moved surge capacity. She’s saying two weeks surge beds full. Masks infringement rights speed limits. It’s public safety issue. ok put sun UV light disinfect it? Meanwhile, [the Lmfao change needs solved systemic level.

I get specific point, covid also needs solved systemic level, wearing masks bare minimum mitigate damage alone enough make whole pandemic go away Especially ironic given arguably leading American researcher coronaviruses, Ralph Baric, works UNC. I’m Georgia. much tired 5 7 year old ass every day, sure hell signed virtual school. 


If teachers fayette/coweta county scared go back want private tutoring, best believe I’ll try find pay them. means would everything possible assure safety. *Laughs American* Sorry buddy. guys cure coronavirus... do. damn China flew comes home, i'll leave holes rifle. God 2nd Amendment protect me, dumbass face mask called ""Harvard"" ""CDC"" scientists think help. God bless guns, God damn it. hear rumors 2 days half school, 1 day shut cleaning, 2 days half school. seem worse keeping classes online me. You’re right, course, quarantined home months makes want nothing eat sugar. Ooo sub going hate article... live underground bunker? Western countries high testing numbers now, that's often misleading statistic: lot starting lots tests *after* outbreaks peaked. Many countries large outbreaks (like US) done fewer 10k tests per million people dropping like flies.

For example, Britain one highest tests per million stats world (the highest medium large-sized country). country's infections happened time hardly anyone tested (at peak first wave, Britain's testing like Brazil's). Antibody studies show 90-95% country's infections missed, despite eventually managing test 1/6 population.

India's deaths certainly higher reported, true countries compared to. Huh? say hypocritical? ""the evidence"" support? take minute appreciate guy believe flu shots work. 

The article claims believes ""these viruses lay dormant waiting right conditions"".

I'd love someone qualified state whether thats even possible sounds ridiculous maybe I'm uninformed...

Also thinks thats true required specify conditions are, occured, occurred preferably occured time... Im well aware, pay attention these, inability produce source displays opinion speaks legitimacy. ^(as non american baffled use prison inmates firefighting. dunno i've never heard before) look ""atomised"" (or ""atomized"") Dictionary, one meanings ""to reduce fine particles spray""... TX, illegal teachers strike. strike, lose teaching certificates Teacher Retirement System (TRS) benefits permanently revoked. teachers know terrified. they're required go back classrooms, thinking quitting. Death rates politicized longer trustworthy comes cause.  

And could correct safety going keep students leaving campus? meanwhile see celebrities like Hilton family going restaurants get paparazzi shots LA. It’s amazing hospitals filling many people still want carry normal social lives. don’t specific link; it’s example crops lot /r/Covid19 many folks far learned tend dismiss contaminated. I’ll try dig specific examples if/when get moment. brandish firearm person verbally harassing you. That's legally justifiable reason point gun someone. really shocked. Majority OC acts like can't catch flu.  involved like reading BS ten lines right mobile too? usually like this. ""I think we're saying thing dude"" 

Or petty ass childish shit. 

I love these. little clue pull well

I working math tutor went down, know exactly feel, side things. No, doesn't, lie. second round actually shut access big banks periods time allow smaller banks upper hand. Money still available today. English/history majors lectured everyone exponential growth feel vindicated hundred positive test results mean daily headlines “new time high!” 

This almost funny refusal acknowledge maybe maybe young people might rationally decide risk coronavirus instead prolonged social isolation. coup would nice fall. I'd attend I'd wear gas mask body armor. get to, I. Take upvote Sorry actually care people Hong Kong Uighurs I'll probably get email. Think Peter Griffin, southern politician isn’t obese. mother law infected long term care home. nephew hospitalized. Yes give government money. That's always answer! Lmao, freedom. Freedom stupid. Huge crazy hospital system CT, Yale new swallowing hospitals, it’s largest employer state crazy good funding reserves part Yale. That’s guess anyway. 

Also governor good job getting everything shut quickly March. didn’t get elderly homes death rates CT probably would bit lower. It’s also like people feel slightest unwell would desire go gym anyway.

You definitely go gyms gone too. People colds hacking coughing snorting sneezing.

I daily gym goer shutdown. Gym opened back couple weeks ago. still sticking basement outdoors work out. don’t trust others slightest maintain “good hygienic practices” times, never mind now, especially seems people “over it” getting even slack. would end reclining seats!!!!

With FAA safety considerations laws, I'd say incredibly painful expensive paperwork hard.

On hand, Trump running FAA, AA could probably go sneezguard store order thou made whatever shatters sharpest shards. Me, married doctor managed office years.

Wife agrees him. Intubation last chance try treated so. God hate part ""we"" nowadays someone level head believes science. could look window see neighbors 30 person fourth July party Texas... fucked. premiere Ontario switched Liberal Conservative license big wind farm revoked, probably thinking of.

It ended going ahead following court appeal. pandemic, I'm going hug every Asian see. can't charge love incidents. shit ton simpletons like Canada Appreciate reply! Best wishes moving forward.  Alaskan checking in. Cases spiking state especially around Anchorage there’s yet case reported burough (2500 perm residents). us live Interior Alaska naturally self isolated really hasn’t change day day life. enjoying usual summer activities backpacking, hiking, camping fishing done relatively crowd free. ""Kids"" go University? least lock planes full people hot spot states hotel rooms 2 weeks... Got plenty friends Florida still trying play catch-up state unemployment system. throw numbers want end day..it doesn’t work like that. get behind account 3 words. get paid for? cover person’s expenses? heck would go unaccredited law school? Build wall! Jesus. assume point PCTs administering meds (though expect confirmation denial point). can’t see another way make work. 

No way Florida budget bring nearly enough nurses. They’re gonna transition nurses roles qualified, quality care going suffer. 

I worry enough loved ones health care Seattle. can’t even imagine medical care workers sun belt. 

I hope you’re calmer work environment (relatively speaking, anyway, given world today). There's lots people traveling everywhere again. Airlines adding flights, Key West last weekend (not holiday weekend) occupancy rates 88%. high prices charge jeans different. source this? odd bias toward keto. specifically unhealthy.  South Korea spritzed bunch people covid holy water infected entire congregation. Idiocy knows borders. finally got numbers managed slowly reopen venues. Mandatory masks help everything stay open instead second wave shutdown.



I think afford second wave shutdown. Masks help save economy. problem, delete post. need rude! Yeah man I’m mindset you. Unfortunately tell anyone here, people tell excuse can’t somehow can. Like said it’s numbers game, takes one yes. Congrats job! *Cries Floridian* Weird mention ventilation; common ventilation shafts tower blocks big potential way virus transmission.

Also fuck window design? live able get tested rather easily. boss harder time. Mucous swapping city there, best part paid corona end 🤣 wife emergency C section time sensitive zero pain killers type baby completely.

This one obviously going different direction Well 1300 accurate. 1000 accurate. Whether 1100 1200, it’s 1300. It’s semantics sure I’m dickish right it, you’re gonna state something, least accurate telling go research myself. actual number 1035 according worldmeter. No. opened without proper protections place masks opened businesses stayed shut clubs bars.

Nothing see here, folks, move along.

/s Whoa slow podnah. America, unlike countries, we've got whole hellofalotta comorbidities. Americans rank 30-35th health developed nation. That's bad, real bad, cases control mutants spreading everyone come contact with.  again, whomsoever mutants come contact vulnerable 50+, shit's gonna get fucky. Also, people deaths argument eluding to, eluding fact 2020 even 100,000 deaths something know prevent spread way much. pass 130,000 deaths callous bullsgit argument kind problem now, innit? last guy go tit right. politics, makes sense. conservative, bigoted, self-serving also happen least intelligent willfully ignorant. too. im texas. hurts see society badly. pray family. Good thing keto doesn’t involve high fat. risk level U.S. vs pretty much everywhere else developed world? Outstanding, thanks posting Even still, california large state large population even exclude counties. genuinely dont know I'm getting downvoted, I'm trying say coronavirus isnt real isnt serious I'm simply saying 2000 cases mean different things depending at, already gave Rhode island example, here's another one. 2000 cases day place like California Texas GOOD, bad COULD given population population density places states. 2000 cases day place like virginia, less major cities, would indicate bad outbreak. Humans share 99% DNA chimpanzees. 90% cats. 85% mice. Point 4% difference DNA implies pretty distant mutation rather next line evolutionary step. Hope makes sense. plenty places show daily death counts. Pick whichever one trust Yeah, see reopening in-person learning tough decision elementary-age children, college students? way, easy choice. Besides misreading title, must cause many us ""underemployed"" even though we're back work. Mine reference distance Toronto Tampa FL. ICU filled capacity. It’s almost like testing day behind, results actually yesterday literally national holiday 4th July? Haha I'm Jax bad here. least masks since city mandated restaurants packed, one respecting social distancing, people rude hell even nicely ask back up. Florida: Hold ventilator Yep. morbid, going take lot dead kids turn right around quick. covid taken lives kids. much lower rate, yes, kids US returning school fall, cases. 

Unfortunate faculty personnel get cherished sympathy, that's is. Basically, go vegan. Bonus points everyone vegan would almost zoonotic diseases like oh don’t know COVID-19, swine flu, avian flu, mad cow. major dietary orgs stated nothing get omnivore diet can’t get vegan diet, it’s suitable stages life. lose nothing flavor there’s good plant milks, butter, cheeses, faux meat, etc. anything it’s easier ever. Oh animal lovers actually back claim loving animals selectively financing enslavement, torture, murder species others.

TLDR: COVID-19 latest reason go vegan, zero reasons aren’t born complacency selfishness. aware it’s July school isn’t session, correct? students campus housing summer.

I know it’s asking lot research I’m sure it’s also better narrative believe every fucking student campus summer know. live boston. calling numbers provided page easily tell you. Yeah lot places file bankruptcy glad Canada I'm introverted too, quite frankly first 10 weeks actually really okay working home etc, I'm sick need normality again. Thankfully able get haircut go cinema feel better, damn miss gym. Daily death rate lowest since beginning. Unlucky. Feeling better? really don’t think senior orange that. would admitting defeat. He’s going let cases, eventually bodies, rack up. need National Reconciliation. bet expect paid full, come Fall though. 
At least we’ll able save lot money firing janitors, maintenance staff, support personnel, drivers, security, admin. get students pay full tuition clearly inferior online offering people get Coursera free, school net fortune. Newsom always gotten shit leftist Californians (and there's quite lot them) moderate politically, makes sense perspective.

But they've also given lot shit much negotiator, elitist, concerned public image. always thought criticisms dumb petty, traits come clearly past 2 months. Agreed FeAr mOngerIng! 130k dead! know testing sites closed holiday that's going mess numbers bit play catch week.

plus locals hard time getting testing. site available times. report success rridays getting time slot following week. means someone feels sick Tuesday get slot booked Friday following Tuesday. Huge lag time limited access. Perhaps millions untested asymptomatics suffered damage feel later. conspiratorial, hiding Covid deaths. I’ve taken squatting wife. Great leg day! Hell sane American donate labor get citizenship? want crazy ass place lol. really fucking stupid. Alot people loving wearing masks since affords bit privacy before. honestly wanna keep wearing one indefinitely lol Would never pass court muster United States America. Full stop there.

Even Maryland, tried 'compulsory masks' legal experts said ""It would fly courts especially Supreme Court go there!""

So went back 'mandate' really mandate businesses enforce. absurd know, judge... Bingo. supposed elective knee surgery March. still crutches waiting new date. dead yet.

However... read recent problem AZ. Guy waiting kidney got call donor week.... hospital bed available kidney sent elsewhere. He's dead--still dialysis--but horror show. (No bed meant ICU bed, assume, staff needed toncover transplant recipient.) answer arrest warrant Iran put him? really would like know percentages serious complications. I'm quite age may kill definitely worried may fuck organs. hoped step toward something better definitely flaws get go mostly insurance industry basically wrote it. really cared would cancelled reopen. something happens blame DeSantis. PR people deflect put plus probably check box waiver stepping foot takes responsibility away Disney anything happens Unfortunately US laws make difficult hold judges responsible negative effects rulings. No. live Houston. Hospitals “at capacity” ICUs aren’t overwhelmed. It’s true large number positive cases. big issue elective surgeries taking ICU beds Abbott’s order last week helped open beds needed. Even ICUs fill hospitals equipped handle situations like necessary space. lack staff, talking multiple doctors I’ve yet hear shortages. know whether ever received text forwarded a.m.., bot removed post purely political, ha, ha. understand. Anyway, was.quite long. bot seem care free speech.We free newspaper midcoast Maine, called Free Press, ought see printed letters pages. receive posted text. hope survive virus, somebody put brakes Covid soon, decimate country population. keep watching horror California, Arizona, Texas Florida. Oh well, much else except go r/politics. rant. can't even convince selfish people wear mask slow spread. would want get vaccinated help end pandemic?

What could unintended consequences getting vaccinated? Can't attend school college, can't go public facilities like bars, restaurants, theaters. Cant work office building job close coworkers face face public. No, nobody sane believed fake January. Nobody sane. trying rewrite history. mean cmon, watch thing, 100's 1000's people shoulder shoulder yelling?? course what's going on.. economy number one concern them. Canada every right hate us now. like douchebag next door blaring loud music night donuts 4-wheelers back yard spikes started two weeks ago right? guess we’ll see within next week two know ""peers"" reviews right?

Other scientists - two hundred consensus. get much ""peer reviewed"" that. ""true People Color Experience. "" implies ones false. seems implied asian color experience true color experience.

"" Asians usually protected positive stereotypes sufficiently isolated deal open racism.""... appears comparison say ""asian racism bad black racism"".

I get saying, might true median asian experience might better median black experience... core racism? Assigning individual identity/experience/etc based group, regardless individual experience is. Therefore, people experienced bad racism asian, acknowledge suffering annoys them.

I feel better first comment would be, ""Yep, average Tuesday POC experience"". month ago, getting groceries wearing mask. guy 60s walked past said manipulated Bill Gates ... words him. approved FDA, safe Jesus wants horses survive barn fire, will. /s Honestly, Canadian would thing 😂 Could please PM location? know someone needs test asap. supposed IFR 0.5% lets break down.

100% people = 1.64m dead

50% people = 820,000

25% people = 410,000

10% = 164,000

Current Death toll ~132,000

This *obviously* perfect reported data. 

Not including damages overworked healthcare system.

Now let know many enough care. Meanwhile city ran ICU beds lol shame sin. American Africans dying twice rate United States citizens residents general. sure, there’s definitely profit motive swaying elections. know fatality rate based published data various countries. fatality rate highly variable seems depend numbers tests accurate reporting.

I expect fatality rate (~~much much~~) lower published numbers get accurate diagnosis, and/or late reporting. Welp like months warning would happen taken seriously. mean... lose sense taste smell... that's something going brain. behalf US: Challenge respectfully accepted. right!! could be!! virus care activity doing!! favorite kind science. 
The kind explains common sense lol That’s scariest part. don’t know enough yet. brother grocery store manager Portland. fellow employees diagnosed Covid. One young woman died, folks mild symptoms. sickest they’ve ever pulled through. suffered secondary infections, immune systems suddenly compromised. Brother cleared go back work 2 months ago, still tires easily. They’ve creative isolating families. Meanwhile, customers complain clerk wearing mask. one social distanced 4th July expect huge jump beyond current rate increase. seems inevitable. I’ve seen, I’m 100% certain alive no, see, slow, controlled, phased reopening make sure virus spreading... actually stop Phases data came back showing spread getting control reopening... Covid-19 affects respiratory system, major affects circulatory system. Blood clots causing stokes occurred alarming rate unusual (young) demographics. sense irony eh? ""Yer sheep"" cried dingus swallows every word emperor. make work however want- government fucking friends purpose. choice. don’t know agree, really care die media finds got COVID one parks. Say want Disney care PR whole lot.

As side note, prices high people paying much parks still overcrowded lol, can’t really lower prices Yes downtrend people like go back gym things part brought back. Look viruses don’t go away. Thanks reconsidering. Good news give attention Cana-Karens, since significant positive things better ourselves. hate whataboutist? Could've fooled ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Yeah idea supposed work India. Tap water drinkable country, people survive without able leave house get water? knows get antibody test right? Brunch people die instant get virus. There's 10+ day lag time infection possibility death. virus goes show house cards economy truly is. can't stop social climbing... insta stories SLIVING /s Actually models said ""If open without certain protections like masks, would really bad!""

Ducey ignored models went full throttle reopen. Bars clubs stayed shut vaccine, hard say that.

All events 50-100 people cancelled well. tuition Here's list locations: seems require referral. bunch deaths good economy either. understand essential employees, even venturing shopping, seems like people unnecessarily. One clients goes shopping every day get apartment. get it, we’re stir crazy, seems excessive time. I’d already transitioned working home 2 years ago. husband started working home stay home order around March, go back 4 weeks office June, possibly exposed confirmed case we’ve quarantining 2 weeks per doctor order (no symptoms everyone seems fine). company small, 4 employees one CEO able comfortably social distance offices, it’s still ridiculous boss made return office soon phase one opened. It’s quite challenging avoid everything else though... two young toddlers. walk around neighborhood best wear every day. days work nightmare. miss daycare much! Yeah live nearby Mississauga every store go keeping strict head count. bubble tea shop frequent lets 5 people time. Time review basic science work university USA, confirm.  think manufacturing issue 1950s really applies Somehow drinking games made article. Huh. open schools kids teach themselves? professors, administrators, staff. dining, financial aid, academic advisors, bursars? Interesting thought. feel “experts” seriously downplaying risk levels. Going fucking road trip low risk like fuck it’s not. Way many variables things . Never blowout job I’m intrigued DARE interfere GOD's method breathing! fear. can't handle stress anxiety situation we're in. attempt mitigate stress denying problem even exists. wrong? CA one highest bed capacities too! sorry, i'm american countries exist /s mRNA vaccines proven safe - completed phase 3 efficacy trials. think safety issue DeSantis won’t even bother issuing mandatory mask order, even though hospitals begged to. poggers That's true. difficult draw conclusions. one reason may spread quickly mutated [10x contagious. However, shown deadly. Example: read anecdotal account guy dying needing liver transplant. surgery put elective, surgery take living donor is. Weird since almost euro cases came unique Italian covid strain US cases europe Labs processing less tests? know TX FL show us many tests reported day. I'm guessing TX processed less tests usual yesterday reporting broken. mean place residents showed meeting Orange County Board Supervisors protest masks God, like making wear underwear (“things need breathe!”). Colour shocked!   Agreed! urban academic centers operate like that. shocked moved somewhat rural hospital system found hardly wait direct admit- previous center 3 days 2 weeks unheard of. 

I didnt know TMCs baseline capacity huge- that’s insane! Totally makes sense though. Godspeed future holds! suspect surge capacity also displacing elective procedures, put period time become urgent well. husband broken, u tried turning allowed head shoot pedophile insane sister law ruins every family event? Good thing really need pants anymore. little V Vendetta-y Good point. would definitely give weekends minimum! vacation time! No, plenty information publicly available government easily access lot information public.

Yes plenty unconfirmed information. even thought hoax, would still completely appropriate president say loud, incredibly dumb say public video played back everyone else shown hoax anyway.

Sure smarter politician would hedges bets early on.

No one arguing Trump brilliant person here. general thinking thing hoax back January reasonable, that's fact. president saying much? No. Dammit. Beat it. don’t see confirmation actual national response. here. Doctor visits safer--you keep mask throughout visits. dental visits insist mask, wide open mouth. Oh, didn’t hear folks? made OC health officer resign due death threats mask mandates. We’re gonna hit 1K daily cases soon. ICU capacity already almost maxed hospitals putting tents. 

“We’re danger.” plain ignorance. Ignorance would never heard coronavirus ways prevent it. arrogance I'm 2 year technical degree plant operations. necessary plants really like new operators program. Yes totally completely agree. let anyone wants citizen citizen come go please. Us adults solved problem. welcome. That's really hard all. I'm in. also seem care many survivors permanent damage lungs, and/or organs. act like recovering simple cold. really wanna help dox I'll say major city south. Cool, arrested/fined $50 000 person living Kansas stunt pisses majority us aren’t simple minded reject idea masks saves lives ignorant think it’s okay publish kind garbage. states implementing required shelter place orders yet? Weren’t positive case numbers mere fraction first set lockdowns?

(putting aside moment insanity large portion population flouting guidelines suggestions) That's built Internet! Rochester NY side lake 9 ICU patients 

NY way cares, CCP blame matter what... Research funded study. 

Also parties bars exception. It’s utterly ridiculous assume protests didn’t cause spread people groves shoulder shoulder shouting. protests, don’t tell anything less that. “How test positive hoax???!!” No, far, far worse position. fact, 50% higher first peak 7 day average April 10th. 32k then, 48k now. talking about? followed thread mid June showed exact tourists dude, American refugees seeking asylum beautiful country. I’m CA county high rate new cases actually pretty impressed seems like people conservative overall. large supermarket Friday, mostly avoided months (sticking smaller local markets) 99% people wearing masks. 

The park across street larger-than-advisable groups picnicking, otherwise almost completely empty weekend. couple weeks ago, case. fucking bounce houses full kids there. think lot people sobered curve went full exponential end June. I’ve that.

Exactly 0 people listened. Forbes credible source hahahaha “Give example vaccine caused problems”
“Polio”
“No, doesn’t count, dummy” someone suffers healthy anxiety totally get this, I've gotten point feel like might better mention anxiety everything gets hand waved ""ah anxiety""

Like yeah, mean maybe is, DONT CHECK SURE? Unrestricted access citizenship national borders= GOOD. 

travelling NY Florida= HOLDON MINUTE would take scientific paper telling simple mask doubles time exposed 1min 2min. rest dreaming results good masks simply available. matter time see deaths start spiking again... disaster leaving die streets

/s wedding got pushed October ‘20 October ‘21. 3 weddings within month. 2021 gonna rager get vaccine I'm skeptical, figured would place ask plausible. University went made 1 mill month parking violation fines alone... I’m sure need back. Dr. Jefferson quoted article saying ""Where SARS-1 go? disappeared,"" then, dear Dr. Johnson, seen numerous epidemiologists say SARS-1 'disappeared' due fact almost ALWAYS spread people symptomatic, world good job isolating sick pandemic died out? can't believe level misinformation reached especially states. two sides seem far concerned blaming side problem (right, based assumption recognize even problem) getting behind everything possible deal it.

Maybe, MAYBE millions start dying shut up, stay home, care risk neighbors, wait (a long time) pass.

Some may say system can't sustain solution, result deaths. well, case maybe finally stipulate sytem broken, likely irrevocably so. talking FL go big testing site testing areas cant take get test results back. physical Dr Thursday, ordered test right went hospital hour later drive thru test. Got call today negative! landlord's nephew (he hangs landlord lot housework I've got know him, distant friend friend.) got tested major site last Monday still waiting results. think surpass 1st peak no? Catherine Great got son inoculated Smallpox prove it’s functionality court Russian populace, trust treatment went direct result. Politicians sides aisle could tested vaccine, imagine many Americans would comfortable vaccine. There's almost 0% chance new microorganism causes illness H2HT detected originates. That's especially true illnesses asymptomatic transmission highly stable surfaces. mimics symptoms common illnesses already human populations. need remember needs critical mass infections/deaths initiate testing even there's high degree luck involved. That’s good. Unfortunately majority people still think it’s high 1% though. way smarter loser. dump ass respecting concerns. Smoke little bit weed evening(Indica) one two puffs people smoke. Put funny movie maybe cartoon used like kid. Decompress. welcome. 18th-21st right Creature? Means positive display symptoms. think tricky. one child grade 3 one SK distance learning year. think lot cover kindergarten social skills, etc. feel like 3rd grader actually far behind even though French Immersion (and speak French, doh!). little ones least likely respect physical distancing, etc... Texas hospitals already forced pick patients admitted hospital. sure sign medical system collapsing. much one wants another lockdown, think they'll forced it.. extremely jealous. Texas using much brainpower. People like need start charged attempted manslaughter. Oh hell yes. broke temporary crown extremely crusty bread. husband started making need bread pandemic like, yeah thanks. prefer soft food like give home. fairness, they're probably young employees extremely small chance dying Covid. might end tens thousands medical bills, 'just' sick weeks lingering issues months after, simply catch pass grandma regards cruise ship; author making sound strange first person shoe symptoms happened day 8? 

Isn’t normal? Yes, listed bunch real authoritarian behaviors. try lump “wearing mask” “surveillance phone calls torture” part ridiculous.  Right millennial driving surge. boomers going bars parties. ""severely ill,"" need go Target, Karen. seems countries never talk/hear much powerful comes dealing actual problems rather going war.

See Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, Greece, Slovakia examples. Toddlers genius. Toddlers. Common Australia. Lucky didn’t know child swimming rivers summer. swimming river wilderness 10 years old barely supervision probably wasn’t great start with, life 80s.

-Cases likely least 10x higher definitely undercounted due testing limitations (many states limited testing March/April). antibody samples done shown 20% New Yorkers got means case number state 3.6m underreported.

-The median age new cases like late 20s/30s (likely getting bars, work, protests). lot data showing doesn’t kill healthy young people masses (in US total deaths 35 deaths less 1000 per cdc).

-Long Term Care centers lockdown everywhere. We’ve seen nursing homes lose quarter residents week. isn’t happening frequently

-potentially could virus mutation well (viruses don’t necessarily want kill host, becoming less lethal good them) Yeah people forget incidents, natural disasters normally make news year still happening now. Hell, SpaceX triumph months ago forgotten like sooo fast. Yup that’s need! white Christian god protect you. /s
Joking aside know someone mindset. thinks goes church prays immune. Maybe bit late whole pandemic, *Asymptomatic* mean? 

Is complete total absence symptoms simultaneously able spread virus? 

Or usually minimal symptoms go unnoticed? 

With that, people able spread virus without symptoms many people usually don’t symptoms contagious initially, effective temperature checks detecting preventing spread virus? Lots people wearing masks beach, they? I-O  :) true. State legislatures pass law tested court right after. Ummmm ya try putting mask toddler (aka ones touch everything) obviously don’t kid. 

Full grown teenagers wear masks, probs don’t need go all, j agree. Sometimes it’s convenience factor though (ie stop store returning somewhere) 

Obviously majority reddit doesn’t kids sadly needs de-programming, radicalized disinformation capmaigns exactly way isis recruits were. hope safe doesnt pick up. least arent enabling misguided views, really something hopefully penny drop see going close 13 think going seriously go away get bailed out? Lol comment history. See therapist. county California reported new high daily cases today (3rd time week new record)
Reported hospitalizations also new high. 
And live appointments get tested week results week more. ...so lagging Exactly! told wash hands easy, science showing effective preventing transmission virus. It’s also frustrating fomites messaging still common constantly sanitizing everything additional cost businesses hurting providing minimal health benefit. least it’s July flu currently something worry about. 

For example, went shopping try support local retailers last week got impatient ended going fewer stores planned waited full 20 minutes line store. weren’t even many customers, combination fewer cashiers due social distancing especially need thoroughly sanitize counter, credit card machine, etc. every customer made take long. mention line long increases risk transmission, although hopefully six feet stickers mask requirements would prevent that. either! boggles mind go people aren’t wearing entire families shopping sprees!  True indoors important. That's ridiculous people can't get simple task wearing mask right... outdoors though, impossible socially distance sidewalks streets, would really better everyone wear mask even outdoors. Plus normalizes practice hopefully helps adoption proper use, especially indoors. article linked nothing title.... Start classes in-person. Collect tuition regular rates.

COVID rises.

Citing safety concerns, move classes back on-line.

""Whoops, could forseen this? worry, still getting *quality education*."" also heard overwork liver kidneys cause brain swelling. People count herd immunity, doctors scientists even know long immunity recover virus, people left serious chronic health problems. get regular flu vaccine, need new shot every year, flu changes every year. people working vaccine know yet Covid do.

 really sorry bit shocking live supposed Super Power country symptoms aligned covid still know regards getting test going work. happens frightening lack leadership. 

Okay, said, advice would : Call work say symptoms. (In Canada, would expected stay quarantine get negative test. job would pay sick leave). Next, get tested. (In Canada, call 811 tell symptoms tell go.)


Best wishes. would make want punch person. 

Not violent person nature, WTF WRONG PEOPLE? brainwashed ""its hoax, china virus, blah blah"" Fukin hell.  sounds like something movie SAW 

Also

 Jails prisons decimated Covid though not.sure would contain spread. No, seen significant amount mask fits country, post asked instead downvoting. Yeah, suppose one possibility haha That’s true. know someone whose philosophy right she’s wearing mask otherwise ignoring everything basically says can’t deal it. she’s definitely smart enough know better.

Congratulations Toronto! Keep up! view Dallas area. wife walked grocery store last evening snacks. saw several parties social distancing well 10 people. Today went laundromat wash comforters 50% people either mask improperly.

I'm hoping numbers drop grim feeling. also heard Hidalgo county south Texas maxed hospital capacity 10 12 hospitals Rio Grande Valley hit capacity. First found definite link wet markets virus straight blaming Chinese people cuisine little premature. 

Second think it’s important distinguish Chinese Communist Party Chinese people. CCP withheld information world that’s one thing Chinese citizens suffered greatly responsible. majority state scoffed risk last months believe they've smartened select pics people social distancing? Forgive skeptical. It’s already bonkers isn’t it?

Googling clicking top article considered research understanding topic. School system definitely flawed, core understanding fundamentals knowledge. Okay source agree though? Cases rise deaths leveled steady, decline. that's possible? possible child infect adult? 

Mild cases 1/60th viral load severe cases almost children asymptomatic mild, likely low viral loads.

This plausible Children much lower expression ACE2 cell receptor, increases age, virus uses enter cells.

There's also observed cross reactivity neutralising T-cell antibodies children generate response Coronaviruses, particular HCov-NL63, children catch common cold Coronaviruses frequently adults. AstraZeneca 

My money one (AKA Oxford vaccine). oldschool tech (deactivated mild virus protein want immune system recognize), got head start (they already working MERS vaccine similar coronavirus pivoted one), thus likely safest definitely furthest along. Security sick people start discharged prematurely make room new admissions, deteriorate need come back again, adding already strained load cyclical fashion.


PUT MASKS DENSE MOTHERFUCKERS Since rich power, easy choice indeed... Duh tried squat wife paraplegic Ya, lot changed years, I've encountered like-minded ppl north East coast. like they're here. Imho, worse areas. Body weight exercises, stretching, running, walking, biking, dumbells, kettle bells (both bought stores online).  easy do.

It done ""very easy"" do....Not everyone lives suburban three bedroom house put gym set driveway. need money space. nice access things everyone drop hundred $$ dumbbell set pay grand quality road bike.

Realistically, thing low maintenance enough running things like pushups. However, bad joints fucked knee running option me. 

You seemed privilaged try ignorant lucky I'm Texan looking for...I stayed home watched Hamilton. acceptable. T1's bit dramatic. 

I've luckily never see partner insulin shortage, seen high low blood sugar. becomes incoherent. 

The time dropped low, stomach virus. literally rubbing honey gums, making sugar water, anything could think of. EMS come would BAD shape. Right? see people freaking wearing seatbelt violation rights. That’s old try 20-23. Yeah honestly idk used friends haven’t seen since March. I've stores much possible. try look bright side. Saving much money, I've ordering truck parts. nobody gives shit numbers, Columbo course isnt win-win-win Yes, needs acknowledged: people die well. presumably vulnerable populations continue isolate infection rates drops zero casualties relatively low. would still casualties group even 100% compliance.

My point okay: long willing accept many ignorant people going get killed could saved them, even 25% rejection rate really hurt rest us much. biggest cost rest us might overload hospitals final wave death, think long get triaged back line behind serious condition, that's fine me. thought already reached 100 percent last week? Like doctors decide gets in..now saying 2 weeks reaching capacity? Okay thanks. I’m hoping governor actually something, seems unlikely... said don’t think either activity huge risk. don’t think either one contributed substantial increases cases.

My point media served narrative one terribly dangerous (Michigan protests) reversed liked protester’s message. ate up, obviously. is. Reddit elitism. true, new normal stay. gonna happen  thing R0 1.1 takes number cases start ramp up. Cases peaks valleys day day numbers. start see trends plot data weeks. Moreover, weekend reporting holiday reporting often shitty, numbers often don’t get accounted next business day. 

Also, lockdowns actually primarily driven ICU beds ICU staff. hospitals hit capacity, region starts forming trend line shows capacity hit, lockdowns fast tool quickly slam curve back down. 

Hopefully people wear practice good hygiene won’t need lockdown flatten escalating curve. Damn Fritz, referring voting poles, people Poles..... ahhhh nevermind! friends aged 26-40 saying they'd vote Kanye. rapidly drift, become ghost. thought read long ago experiencing surging numbers? virus turning deadly now? sucks ok bad year 2 life long. shitty teenage years, twentys fun, thirties even better.

The rest GAF. Waste space printing something they'll likely never read, let alone influenced by. trying sound like conspiracy theorist, anyone considered connection covid strange phenomenon ""vaping illness"" US last year? always seemed bizarre me. Vaping around quite time never problems, US ones initially see cases. Perhaps origin virus (prior mutation) much less transmissible much lethal, viruses apparently mutate they're deadly. scans lung images covid patients vaping illness patients appear alike, though I'm capable saying certain. thought wonder long going take miscreants turn racial issue push division agenda. Brain-drain you’re looking for. it’s biggest problem US facing looking torward future. perfectly healthy people well. ""It envisaged launch vaccine public health use latest 15th August 2020 completion clinical trials."" phase 3.... Ok I've always advocated safety Covid vaccines even think rushed. considering dire situation India many lived lost day delay suppose justifiable. hope goes well. odds favour thing go wrong huge blow cost lives later road giving fuel anti-vax movement. massive handout wealthy pittance rest us distract former. deaths scattered look average show clearer trend. average increased 85%, significant change average. trend average consistently couple weeks now. really get clearer this, unless instead wide variety daily numbers instead showed steady daily climb. Since data come steadily like that, examining moving average best bet.

Honestly, even without moving average look peak death days. week peak higher last four weeks. think showing insane trajectory March / April nationally numbers flat people troubles accepting facts. mean, point ships report cases safe dock? family going continue wearing masks. can't unified approach. Hopefully help replicable, that's debate. times crisis better careful agree taking precautions anyway revommendable, acting like knoen fact since beginning march plain wrong. Sounds like slavery tbh. land freedom ass. sure fuck hope think people deemed essential even outside medical community. suspect significant effect many them. Save masks, forest fires, dust storms, maybe volcanic eruptions always happen additional use also produce runs masks. Eh, physical presence school debatable. Lots children homeschooled successfully. 

I'm sure ideal children limitations also think health publics health important. 4 months, child going damaged lifestyle change quickly maybe something else going on. 

In non pandemic world, many children get extra activities costly programs even play dates. 

Going bike rides, hiking, camping (even backyard), home art activites, going nightly walks, etc options. adults find ways cope, parents find ways children cope. 

I also find strange parents say spend time involved children burden problem stressful negative term. 

I would loved anything parents spent quality time growing up. show list families deceased victims. I'm sure make feel better. much money get Big Virus he’s dead? Dumbass. want know politicians stockholders take scared of, this: people realize actually need endlessly consume happy. yes. record levels unemployment becomes clear one largest flaws American healthcare tying healthcare job.  us feel right we're contributing society one way another extended period time.

That’s definitely case. definitely wasn’t healthy wouldn’t died then. one ship sick, clear unless people going ship food supplies. 

At point, probably safer travelers. agree mask mandating late game. However, already seeing dramatic decline due effective social distancing delaying re-opening non-essential businesses. 

People staying home. government pretty decent job meeting financial needs found work due Virus. 

As inch towards re-opening even mandating masks Critical part getting back level normal again. know going sound horrible Im glad finally gone. family put much stuff trying keep alive. felt bad kept him, knowing wouldnt make it. May rest peace finally free pain. public shaming drunk drivers. one storms city council meeting demand right drive drunk. No-maskers need made feel shame. How? Leadership needs brand masks patriotic. Go USA . Let's hit 200k !! true need case numbers low enough make safe reopen. places may case, Texas. try get antibody test. even people longer antibodies. sick January. entire month. got antibody test going back work positive. get retested recently longer antibodies. Stop reading news, check major newspaper week something. online media consumption gone way down, read proper books now, mental health better years. member aforementioned political party let say nothing party person follow.  one cannot say said person worthy leadership.  therefore opinion masks.  protect others wear one. isn’t magic, UV, lesser extent, heat humidity outside.

You seem really attached result. it’s good science, easy verify. course can’t verify it. It’s like finding alien signal far away star system losing recordings. telling science consensus thing? way dude.  Yes is. reliable covid tests. need quarantine coming boat seen case probably 2 months. sound like somebody would necessarily healthy immune system. US tests less per capita country like Portugal example. US severe testing issues. Russia tests per capita US, almost 1.5x times more. China different level, test anyone else astonishing speed, last month tested entire city size New York less 2 weeks.  
 
 
Values testing available worldmeter exception China, article 2 3 weeks ago reddit talking many tests China tho, trully insanity. Okay, 007-boomer. Ain't like one warned 🙄 course not... first hypothesis, observe theory....

Etc. stage facts yet, no. diamond princess pretty good evidence. Guests isolated cabins centralized air getting sick. valid safety concerns vaccine. I’m extremely pro-vaccine, rushed vaccine long term effects can’t studied short time frame. young healthy people see thinking risking covid might safer us end asymptomatic. Wearing mask protect others one thing (and I’ve obviously it) injecting rushed vaccine potentially risking health protect small number people at-risk can’t get vaccine much different ask. Fuck shit man. fought long hard. needs put big boy pants say cameras:

""Listen fucking bastards. Wear mask! care excuse is. Put mask on""

*Thousands* THOUSANDS lives could saved this. testing free? Oh noes!!! 85% increase considered insignificant? Since nearly doubling considered insignificant? think talking public dangerous give credit for. one talks Japan's tightly packed trains, people emit little droplets silent. Mask play role, better spray masks catch spray. 

There one super-spreader event Korea, instructor infected lot students fitness dance class, none yoga class. researchers think workout intensity, suspect yelling instructions loud dance music vs speaking soft yoga music important part. super-spreader events happened call centers, bars, resturants, churchs, choirs, weddings, sport stadiums, places people talk/sing/yell lot. Maybe instead focusing physical strength could dedicate time fortitude motivation become stronger person it. new challenge. Meet head on. Talking Americans come every summer still plan coming end July idea need quarantine 2 weeks worth food...oblivious logic, simple scientific figure. &lt;0.3um &lt;0.3um matter think it. answer self-explanatory, it? worry, truth thing always comes time.

Frequently , ship registered one country, crew another, company owning business registered tax haven, ship contents insured one entities who-knows-where. Cruise ships legal ball yarn. crime occurs sea, ship found moving illegal cargo, finding responsible expensive difficult. federal government used time insure production enough safety equipment, ventilators kind specialized medical equipment (like ECMO) might useful specific circumstances.

Returning Germany may problem aside, never really understood pork divisive topic religious texts teachings.

I heard several theories.

The first, common, is, /u/vlad__k said, ban due parasites (raw/undercooked pork dangerous meats). People noticed many eaten pork became sick said ""Alright, guys, let's eat animal"". 

Another theory due pigs competing humans food (sheep, goats, cows eat grass leaves interest humans, pigs' diet similar). ancient times food abundant raising pigs seen wasteful therefore banned.

And third one that, contrary, long time ago pig sacred creature prohibited eat (case point, India cows), time initial reason ban forgotten, ""do eat pigs"" imperative remained subsequent Middle-Eastern cultures interpreted ""pig bad"". Everyone eligible. It’s possible make *too little*. *should* state’s Medicaid.

I'm sitting scared bc 100 degree temp rn weird feel fevery ur comment made laugh loud lmao fair though university doesn’t really teach critical thinking either though. get degree without ever demonstrating original thought. make effort either way. Good luck trump Thanks explanation. Like makes sense lol thats literally predictions made, using past data forecast future. look case trends, DEFINITELY increasing. Thats fact, speculation. Also, positive test rate also increased pretty dramatically , testing cases. Currently, number people test positive, 10.6% hospitalized- using data previous 2 sources looking Houston area example since thats discussing. average hospital stay covid patient is10-13 days arent critical ICU [Source : (if survive, obviously longer ICU care). Based that, fact already half way surge capacity TMC (largest medical complex world), hard jump. resources (beds staff) facilitate could standard covid recovery PEOPLE DIE otherwise would lived Thus giving us increased death rate... come dude This. Glad state good, low numbers across state yesterday underreporting. 

I mean LA county zero well, assure ain’t nowhere near accurate. 

Expert larger numbers today. /u/howstupid least appologized (Great username though) Ok, let's honest, that's shitty list. looked find getting data from. Also 2 months old. list 26 countries us 16th list, great ranking far comprehensive list. _America_ early estimates I've seen say around 30% hospitalised cases show least signs lung damage post covid. destruction death comes friends family turn blind eye deny live Africa good luck one.

Tragic. exploitation. Basically Walmart getting away paying employees liveable wage, forcing tax-payer subsidized food stamps, employees happen pay into, employees also buy groceries Walmart using food stamps. Lovely point is, don’t blame public’s stupidity mess. better explanation. don’t like plane populations based group’s prevalence virus. state, almost half cases found ethnic group small minority. don’t want say place minority don’t want promote group blame game, see problem considering groups people worse outbreaks stupid. First round tests, looking good, next round (with 100 times test persons) supposed start weeks. Ugh, hospitals overwhelmed death counts grow exponentially, anti-mask crowd blame everyone else it.

Germany 80mil inhabitants. shut March/April lower cases cases low enough, contact tracing mandatory masks kept infections control despite reopening step step since May.

We still tighten measures new cases city reach ln 50 per 100,000.

Yes, solution vaccine, then, test/trace/isolate necessary protect people.  kids still living Greek houses? seeing cruise ships basically petri dish attached toilet that's dumping directly oceans, think I'll ever get one Yea Covidtracking.com much better states. gets numbers straight state websites Nate silver uses daily COVID tweet would solid effort destroy 100m doses though Cool, I've always wanted thought dirty diseased American travel abroad. wish death upon deleted. saying cater small group people? logic could used say covid wont harm vast majority population immune compromised elderly stay home. 2020 really giant loss.

Yes. That's possible intent behind posting response. Yo man, that's real fucked shit, hope allright soon. I'm beginning wonder much church attendance might factor infection rates expressed different communities. Depends we’re talking about. USA, CDC said many 1/3 cases asymptomatic would mean that, best, 2/3 cases symptomatic. death rate USA since beginning pandemic 4.5% Many still suffer extremely unpleasant symptoms, course number across demographics - older people people disadvantaged backgrounds kind likely face higher rates morbidity.

Chances show you’ll survive. ‘Not dying’ low bar, it’s clearly meant. don’t even know long term effects illness yet - cases chronic fatigue anecdotally affecting mainly young sufferers disease, we’ll fully understand impact things like well decade.

Of course, you’re one lucky asymptomatic cases, may well still pass disease family, friends, coworkers. could find losing one them, temporarily. 5% morbidity could worse, possible pull together 20 people know love represented random selection demographics America, could safely knock one got coronavirus - we’ll probably end getting rate. wouldn’t bet life it, anyone else right mind?

I surprised half workforce transition work home permanently said done, another quarter going couple days week without fixed seats. come us experience whole new world Michigan transparent data. I’m sure actuality deaths due holiday, overall Michigan pretty well LMAO. didn’t need bring angle. asking scientific viewpoint. Dark skin means lower vitamin co-relates lower immunity. Don’t hold breath. 4th shit show.

For **human** coronavirus. vaccines coronaviruses, canine one instance. disagree decision, protect little PPE supply healthcare workers could it. also important note understanding virus changed time. Masks prevent people infecting others, protect people getting infected. knew many asymptomatic spreaders were, telling people stay home sick seemed sufficient. Masks really help sick people about, they're best neutral case. little PPE, messaging.

Again, disagree. also know tell Americans there's dangerous disease going around, healthcare workers need masks, hoard anyway. that's exactly did. think real solution ramp domestic PPE production December, obviously happen. Kind of. suffocation. hate headlines like this. *reporting* deaths slowed halt. 

Maybe one died - let’s hope so. reporting deaths isn’t something happens instantaneously automatically. currently happening kids illegal immigrants detained? exposed virus? heard peep since virus fiasco began. Well far bigger problem blood testing usa basically billion dollar duopoly. small labs attached hospitals universities small state labs everything else pales comparison.

Well done Michigan. least one state positive news. Atlantic danger getting wet! True true, suspect it, still verified peer reviewed studies also proof people spreading Covid going beaches Florida example? American caravans coming. new coronavirus cases seem gone exponential US, yet death rate still trending downwards.

Is simply delay, factors play here? Better treatments, misreporting deaths? holiday see real data?

Somewhere 12.5% 25% state infected. That's enough drop R significantly. Even enough drop R 1 (though might be), enough combined mask wearing/social distancing. Whether call immunity herd immunity semantics. effect. I’ll lucky get pack wipes week. That’s dire is.

There standard timelines vaccines. Every single one different, amount participants trials due widespread vaccine also differs. 

It sounds like regurgitating something read Facebook fact willing source claims telling. Someone actually done test Weibo. took CT lung scans vaping illness patients showed COVID-19 specialist doctor China without revealing context see reaction straight went ""that's goddamn positive case"" immediately. Looking fatality rate metric nation handling virus better flawed why:

Canada's well past peak first wave. sweeping majority COVID cases Canada resolved.  Statistically higher fatality rate going die first wave, already died. Mortality rate currently Canada close 8%. 

We currently 27883 active cases. 75% COVID cases Canada currently resolved (Recovered Dead)

The USA currently mortality rate 5%, biggest difference still much peak activity virus.  1,852,019 unresolved cases America. 64% COVID cases USA unresolved. 

You looking situation 75% Canada's COVID cases resolved, mortality rate 8% comparing USA 36% COVID Cases resolved mortality 5%.  harsh reality lot people USA still sick whether survive still determined. 

The TLDR higher active case load lowers mortality rates. 

These numbers revisited again, USA similar position Canada resolved majority cases. think sits toilet makes stuff tell followers. makes fake ""facts"" fall constantly! think permanent damage claim alarmist. study lung recovery looks decent 2 month follow up, /r/COVID19/comments/gixkjj/followup_chest_ct_findings_from_discharged/ recall correctly comparable better SARS1 lung scan follow ups. mean ""Great Juul Sky?""

Whatever, I'm getting cheese fries. 95% us never even seen corona test. lmao.

150k dead counting.... Based IFR estimates, somewhere 12.5% 25% state infected. point, herd immunity effect lot working reducing R. similar situation MA, NJ, NYC. Mask wearing social distancing still important, unlikely kind major surge possible. loss smell/taste temporary? Also, happening symptoms sort comes goes severity? me, dude. Ive wearing 3 months.

I trying avoid hypocrite, people decided strictly follow science would convenient me.  US divided follow Murdoch publications not. articles really need start identifying enemy. going keep copying pasting this? It’s meaningless. Michigan got hit early, deaths came months ago. locked early though, flattened curve well contained. 

Meanwhile Florida (Desantis) nothing short criminally negligent get go. took recently finally blow up. That's great news indeed.  antivax might wait month trying get vaccine. Something rushed got flaws naive dude. cant see they're trying articles like hopeless you? gap cases death due combination testing capturing huge number milder cases, new cases significantly younger (fewer nursing home outbreaks far, primary driver deaths spring) treatments getting better (Oxford said hospitalized deaths fallen four-fold since April). spread also increasing, number tests leading cases, portion tests coming back positive increasing well, suggesting spreading faster ramp testing. many hospitals end reaching capacity, next weeks pretty rough. Phoenix? ""special"" exactly part problem. ""I've never heard trust it.""

5 minutes google explain what's going on, apparently big expert that's necessary.

Tissue damage pneumonia leads scarring, called fibrosis, reversible. Tiny blood clots cause new blood vessels grow, they're disorganized, pressing high blood pressure lungs deceased efficiency. Also reversible.

Based Italian study, estimate 1 5 people needed intensive care end kind damage. run company thin margin can't even get couple months bad times wrong. really embarrassing unacceptable anti-China trolls around world, think professor Oxford must paid say so. Following Italy, Argentine Spain also found traces COVID-19 waste water samples taken November March, 2019, respectively. What's extra disgusting people actual disabilities often ones way risk getting dying horribly covid. Yet antimaskers problem putting disabled risk convenience even apparently okay using ADA weapon people designed protect. mean fuck, much despicable get? almost bad stealing money kids cancer charity... pulled something chest weird tight pressure, sure lifting something want go ER (definitely turned heart related). Wife got sn infection elbow almost go hospital, ended going ER whole forearm turning red (antibiotics gone now). 1yo bicuspid valive doctors want keep following make sure developd fine, GP checkup (would catch murmur something) deferred echocardiogram things settle down. totally get delaying treatment. Pisses people want go party say ""just stau home"" excuse anyone objects, wish could life happens still interact someone eventually. Wonder many end crippling medical debt. It’s literally piece cloth wear maybe 30 mins. Boohoo. wear mine 9 hours day :\ believe you. I've reading lot personal/anecdotal stories people r/ covid19positive story sounds lot like many there. people fully recovering 90-120 days.

Good news lot 'long haulers' (people who've symptoms long time) seem recover still, takes bit. keep taking easy, make sure see doctor monitor things. get it. Think cherry picking data though. saying look peaks use relative low point come 85% increase.

Yes, uptick past two weeks. Texas responded appropriately severity uptick? opinion time tell. I'm rushing judgment believe data inconclusive point think viewpoint shared experts wonder long going take miscreants turn racial issue push division agenda.

So uh... need mirror? That's special kind WTF, Coronavirus put end more-than-one-year long political split Belgium... nobody wanted remotely responsible bad response. 
1) mainstream parties decided truce made ""emergency government"" special rights months. 
2) created discussion group, territorial bodies *de facto* followed decisions. 

For unaware, country three languages seven independant governments (3+3+1 : 3 different main levels according competencies involved). 
For example, even maximal driving speed roads different. 

We ""that country"" one territory single-handeldly blocked completetion CETA agreement lousy clause reguarding tribunals, never able make thing across even two governments, political parties even unofficially advocating splitting country half... 

And politicians STILL decided forget differences 6 months covid behind us. online cant one teacher make lesson video shown students district grade level? Seems efficient way? teachers grade assignments get reassigned positions, sub teachers sick cannot work? record, Minnesota big spike. We’re still one states level slowly trending up. I’m homeschooling kids. Although comment directed towards socialization aspect coronavirus lockdown, want send message give info, could try help schooling (former elementary school teacher here). Thanks explaining it. doomed. still sounds helpful. Life Corona could well mean life next one. mustn’t forget viruses keeps coming indications frequently. prevent daunting challenge answer long-term. virus saying? here. one overly optimistic idiots thought we'd somewhat control July well. forgot share country Trump voters. shame that, forcefully wrongly told something fine actually evil, people sometimes respond thinking nothing wrong. Don’t worry everyone, doesn’t affect children all. aren’t dying, therefore everything great! /s

I say though, virus shined huge light problems US. Schools huge babysitter food source parents. I’m kids split schedule class learning remote. remote learning, parent leave 7-8 year old home? daycare send even afford. many unanswered questions lack plans, least Ohio remember linked DNA similarity (90%) . DNA similarity sometimes misleading. Actually, chimpanzees share 99% DNA us. origin complicated mostly impossible. People bring hypothese find weak clues. Illinois' governor done great job. vote feel imminent danger get groceries go work, I'm thankful that. Yeah direct threat direct threat, doesn’t matter disability case threats others. Yes, coronavirus economic recession! Haha fair zone second movie days. Pretty sure family kids fine. cannot imagine families kids special needs. Specially live small accommodations. everybody lucky big house big garden. one reason must avoid new lockdown costs rage people taking simple precautions like wearing f\*ing mask. Carve Trump's face it, he'll much desired sculpture mountain. make monument symbol utter total betrayal abandonment American people party responsible for. narrative young people ignoring distancing masks fit endless groups older people see without masks annoyed hoax. 

But sure. Young's fault there's Karen's seen anywhere. mind wearing get vaccine. makes feel better, almost contact people outside family 4 turned ok. sibling mother stay-at-home parent kept home. You’re replying denialist, fyi. young getting infected, thus death rate lower opposed earlier outbreak majorly 50+ “I’m paying rent home enjoying yours” news still reach homepage amount vote manipulation. Covid America's perfect solution minorities. time fine. way better options now. Iv saying months now. People gave Alot flak saved countless lives unlike president.. Outside seems ""safer"" 127 new cases Australia closing internal borders. Meanwhile, Florida seeing 10,000 cases day they're...doing nothing. think would die laughter find first case actually USA. individual level, extroversion peaks early life (kids, teens, early-mid twenties). People young emotionally *need* around others. Introverts 26 demographic minority. HIV appear risk factor severe covid 19 recent studies I'm frustrated. People blind.  death probably take two weeks actually added California’s count. Time reap sowed Reflux/GERD another possibility. would surprised viral 2 months. worse eating? !RemindMe 2 weeks happening county well. husband careful. family going nothing happened. sister (50, morbidly obese diabetes, lots risk factors) indoor party last Saturday. parents went well, 70s health issues. declined invitation, trying respectful it, said things like, “Have thought seeing someone paranoia?” “I’m going let media run life!” I’ve completely lost respect them. fact get shamed trying contain spread global pandemic making seriously lose faith country. Well still would say daily infection rates size small town (40k 50k) far ""under control"".
Especially Europe similar population size US, curve flattened even worst times infection rate lower what's going accros pond.

Not mention absolute moron leader Mt. Rushmore speech talk wearing mask want to. dude supposed lead good example. expect form man needs cartoons briefings, otherwise pay attention. agree. takes lot self control openly pissed people refuse wear masks. think would made sense make masks mandatory Ontario stores places like remainder 2020. pretty sure people, (and seen them) beat gums social media masks, ""killing people"" nonsense like that, pretty sure would insist doctors nurses wearing masks ***they*** needed surgery themselves. would ***them***, would change opinion effective masks really are. Masks new idea, mask effectiveness open debate. That's masks used hospitals long, long time. pretty easy Google. need PhD understand spraying spit people pandemic probably good idea.

When couple narcissism stupidity, seldom turns well, Canada, people quite minority, thank goodness. Can't catch break 2020 we? No, truly tough, must tough enough tough society hating you. Also fact deaths lag many weeks behind case numbers. Filling hospital beds make number much worse means OPEN TGE SCHOOLS!!! 

“I can’t take kids anymore!”
“How supposed go back work!?” Whatever figures data China gives you. think it’s pretty safe multiply factor 10 Asking legal advice...my landlord come work place. never wears mask gloves, even ""dirty"" work (my septic tank backed basement weeks back, direct contact actual shit). usually brings wife along I'm single female, wear one either. wear mask come over. I'm wondering rights here. I'm renting them, feel like ask wear mask property. Also, did, God Forbid, get COVID, would case sue wearing masks possibly passing disease me? Stop believing lying media. profit fear understand that? whole lockdown panic also wonderful side effect forcing digest bullshit content 24/7 means $$$$ them. sounds like virus racist. likely stupid people stats. probably (again) US inequalities.

in essence, people like write articles living social conditions increase effects corona. there's justice world... appreciate reasonable accomodation, need accomodate it... that's problem people. still does. righty Facebook thinks unpopular cause circlejerk other. Yeah look Broadway star lost leg fought 91 days ended passing away days ago.... Yeah confused comment well. worst yet come brother Bubonic plague shows naturally time, including US. easily treated antibiotics.

China already put earlier cluster plague earlier March. Yeah he's spamming number means anything. 

Michigan already first wave. Florida Georgia getting started.

And that's even get fact Michigan actively counting testing without numbers games. point different, I'm sure asking like gotcha question. Pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) results coronavirus infection, cause permanent lung damage.

There studies confirming permanent long term lung damage covid covid around like 8 months. do, however, studies similar coronaviruses like MERS show kind permanent scarring. unique quirk covid causes scarring blood clots, immune response people seems severe affects lungs (whereas MERS SARS mostly affected one). One theory explain cytokine storms, that's confirmed afaik. CT scans show ample evidence damage, reported imaging features COVID-19 variable nonspecific significant overlap SARS MERS. Early evidence suggests initial chest imaging show abnormality least 85% patients, 75% patients bilateral lung involvement initially often manifests subpleural peripheral areas ground-glass opacity consolidation. Older age progressive consolidation might suggest poorer prognosis. Besides acute phase, CT recommended follow-up individuals recovering COVID-19 evaluate long-term permanent lung damage including fibrosis, seen SARS MERS Impaired diffusing-capacity, lower respiratory muscle strength, lung imaging abnormalities detected half COVID-19 patients early convalescence phase. Compared non-severe cases, severe patients higher incidence DLCO [diffusing capacity carbon monoxide] impairment encountered TLC [total long capacity] decrease 6MWD [6 minute walking distance] decline.

They're seeing kind outcomes damage saw MERS SARS (also coronaviruses) included permanent lung damage, known negative health outcomes pneumonia ARDS, like permanent lung damage.

Instead sending kids school, write representatives local governments implement measures. Visit local food banks feed families; better spend half hour several hours work grocery store. food banks going give time soon; keep getting ""unsellable"" product (day old bread, canned goods past ""expiration"" date, etc) donated grocery stores.

The idea crews time community service rehabilitation part prison sentence vs prison punishment.

What hoping instead? think case thread along lines people otherwise low-risk cannot put remove mask own, like otherwise healthy quadriplegic. think people medically unable wear masks mostly public and, I've seen them, Lord careful, scared, apologetic.

FWIW Denmark also period March like: ""oh, HARD, can't test trace *everyone* never happen :("" reassessed thought ""nah, good"" around time *actually* shifting policy, similar thing: praised Denmark roof core message ""good thing changing right strategy now, pursued wrong one time"".

So think looks good terms Swedish authorities' *desire* switch Test, Trace, Isolate... hangup *ability* switch over. There's lot dysfunction Swedish system making change harder Denmark.

## Abstract

**Background**

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) believed mostly transmitted medium-to-large sized respiratory droplets although airborne transmission theoretically possible healthcare settings involving aerosol-generating procedures. Exposure respiratory droplets theoretically reduced surgical mask usage. However, lack experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage prevention COVID-19.

**Methods**

We used well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters naïve hamsters closed system units comprising two different cages separated polyvinyl chloride air porous partition unidirectional airflow within isolator. effect surgical mask partition placed cages investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens tested viral load, histopathology, viral nucleocapsid antigen expression.

**Results**

Non-contact transmission found 66.7% (10/15) exposed naïve hamsters. Surgical mask partition challenged index naïve hamsters significantly reduced transmission 25% (6/24, *P*=0.018). Surgical mask partition challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission 16.7% (2/12, *P=*0.019) exposed naïve hamsters. Unlike severe COVID-19 manifestations challenged hamsters, infected naïve hamsters lower clinical scores, milder histopathological changes, lower viral nucleocapsid antigen expression respiratory tract tissues.

**Conclusions**

SARS-CoV-2 could transmitted respiratory droplets airborne droplet nuclei hamster model. transmission could reduced surgical mask usage, especially masks worn infected individuals.

* [histopathology [surgical face Section:** [Major edited comment something radically different, talking coronovirus affecting diseases, referring ""brain eating virus"" Florida. much want bet substantial number ventilators still think it’s hoax. funny everyone finds impossible believe someone great shape could killed virus. many people making excuses, trying convince can't happen someone young. ""Nick Cordero health coronavirus"" top search.  surprised every day see stories ""some person went Florida vacation, returned home caused outbreak"". feel like must coming. here! took week pretty strict diet last week, Sunday felt like garbage. Never wanna again. feeling lockdown lot enjoyable married children.

All people know kids think lockdown SUCKS. third tome I’ve posted last 5 minutes. Probably annoying, well written: It’s called broke buddy. Universal healthcare free even cheap healthcare. Universal healthcare would likely made difference Cordero's case. People wear mask discriminating people high risk groups worst way jeopardizing safety. unheard of. amazing done loft burden ridiculous government wait times. Even FDA Priority Review, companies wait least 6 months, usually even longer. get feedback tests wait even longer. waiting eliminated here. Companies also able build existing MERS SARS vaccines virus complicated like retroviruses hiv. medical condition makes impossible wear mask half hour make risk group covid? Nothing done says country happens regularly... Hi live here. suburb fairly middle high economic town. took drive yesterday get house. Every church parking lot full. Like... them. couldn’t believe it. people ignoring virus. Luckily work home financial ability never leave house to.

But keep mind, Florida swing state. many intelligent, educated, responsible people “Florida men” riff raff. speak us say... much non-Floridians outside looking thinking “how state obtuse?!”, Imagine feels inside looking around piss poor job state done, leader didn’t vote for, surrounded half society doesn’t believe science dumb even opinion. 

Help us! would forced factories produce swabs tubes testing. Communist! Educate Americans properly they’ve missed lead government false practices keeping people safe oh, bad, always go alone.

Grab child, 2 people along know like :) point Texas hospitals overwhelmed? I’min Houston reading 4 weeks “this week run beds.” (I believe overwhelmed already like...what message? goal post seems move every day?) yet black black death crime awfully quiet. 100 killed weekend Chicago NYC. Still peep. None know of. kind moot anyway, even formal result, she'd say ""bad test"" part ""plandemic"" propaganda... (I hope hear eyerolling way are.) Anyway, results would Japanese, she'd still reason ""doubt"" it. arguing kinds people using facts logic. remind 1 week brain hurts idea ICU space elective surgeries. entire recovery wards patients return surgery. don’t need ICU. “half-maskers” onto something? right include people 20. majority people world 20. Deaths rates raise quite bit every ten years 20. evidence everywhere. Go live leak. see plenty examples. hope Americans keep civil war dont drag rest us you. werent sports Hollywood guys wouldnt anything value obese medical research subjects. That’s prediction. guess next chopping block gyms, theatres indoor dining. opened while. Fast food never actually closed. Ice cream places open month- biggest issue Cape Cod rude customers.

Theaters knew addition mentioned. think we're exactly flocking go there- mall restaurant reopenings also subdued. 25.9 positive test rate. level, number new cases report basically depends much ramp testing down. whatever took, worth it. Silky guy! :) Yeh whole thing cock pretty much control Victoria. kept letting people come go hotel quarantine worse ever. Stage 4 start selling drug see there's widescale issues. big city. Densely populated areas always going worse rural ones. giving contradictory protocol also free... yet O’fuckmeville Mayor BLOCKED Ducey imposing mask mandate WEEKS Bexar Travis counties Texas enacted last mandates 6/22 6/23. impact cases 7/5. We're seeing nothing real time, yet cling pseudoscientific assumptions.

Masks recommended pre-COVID reason: scientific evidence behind them. Forgive me, don’t think idea able return pre-covid normal bad news? 

The idea living world never large social gatherings social distance 24/7 sounds absolutely miserable me. Maybe it’s frequent concert/sports goer, anything doesn’t get us back nightmare. time span 15 minutes article reveals far back well known disease. thought aerosol transmission established. even relevant anymore? Well Russian interference propaganda playing ""Trump"" Card president, dont think we're going last much longer world stage. Setback no. 795 herd immunity plans? shit. shocked. 

SHOCKED!!  “It’s airborne! means let breath freely cough virus get sick! Dumm liberalz don’t understand common cents!” Yep, there's specific provision indicates accommodations would put health safety others risk required. Ah yes, comes second bot. pretty crazy good news barely gets attention (besides random vaccine post) recycled Texas, Florida Arizona doom posts hit front page. I’ve always wondered is. guys clicked article read it, highly recommend do. bit long side but, God. sheer ignorance stupidity people never seizes leave wanting leave Earth sometimes. We're number one! We're number one! hand, Swedish border towns still seeing traffic Denmark Finland. thus easy see part harm due Norway's measures. I’ve saying months! husband rolls eyes me. tell come back face shield welcome business. There's bit spectrum ""dead"" ""100% okay. plurality people permanent lung damage. Including people asymptomatic. Viral load also huge factor! Masks bring load down, therefore, lowering likelihood infections. Also, wear mask velocity particles lower, spreading around much. even disturbing states getting hit worst right watched unfold NJ/NY.

And we're seeing happens states see happening ignore it/don't learn it.

And fear we're going see states who, despite watching states watch happening NY nothing seeing effects, STILL GOING NOTHING. like states learn we're spiral layers layers watching anything different.  Tons people arent wearing masks Europe! like Swedish online defense force here... dying it, mean ok. Sure he's wrong hamtaro time use word “least”, reveal agenda.

As already said, taxing Wall Street fairly would fully cover universal healthcare *and some* meaning ""freebies"" (which know actually free, intellectually dishonest arguing bad faith). social life pandemic nah Yep. It’s leaving healthy folks devastated. sure hope don’t children use air conditioning car giving nonsense advice understand, wants reelected, action helping himself, thinking? Don’t bother.. sub pro-fear hurts. it’s good news turned bad news. 

“Just wait 2 weeks” Reddit user -LockdownTill2030 said 2 weeks ago made webbing? Norway closed down. Sweden not. borders stay closed due this. Borders Norway Finland open shopping normal. EU allow us travelers, would let EU travelers go come back? Nice use statistics.

First off. numbers FDA bullshit. Period. End story. Pneumonia deaths *happen* massively higher year year modern history. *convenient.*

Secondly, factoring people died afraid go hospital Covid-19. Yes, clearly killed Covid-19 directly, would alive Covid-19.

Thirdly, fine, let's use .26%. US population 328,200,000, approx. would 8.5 **million** deaths.

Let's put 8,500,000 deaths perspective.

The Civil War, bloodiest war US history, lives lost: approx. 620,000 deaths.

US deaths WW2: 418,000 military deaths.

To hit 8 million deaths, would look Russia's loss life WW2.

Russian military loss life WW2- 8- 10 million... called creative accounting.. billionaires it.. natural government follow lead. I'm scientist, believe vast difference riding microscopic droplets AIRBORNE. Someone smart chime in? wonder stats compare ww1 soldiers people across world traveling commercial flights 2020 actually worse we're acting like better.  fear go US. No. example virus that, worse.

People think virus big deal. wAnT TesT gET tESt according Greta leader. liked Barack took lot heat saying want keep insurance Donald lies, falsehood, misstatements 1000's. Barack made mistake Donald lifestyle.  dad spent long time watching Fox news yesterday he's stomping around claiming current surge covid cases backlogged tests April, ivu beds filling elective surgeries. 

This like fifteenth set conspiracy crap I've heard since pandemic started. Well whatever people successful reducing death rates 25% April.

The Covid death rates lowest since things know April makes sense less people died. Let’s hope less deadly deaths lag. 

I worry hospitals states getting overwhelmed, though. he’s Redditor! often found talking typewriters. archive [http://archive.is/CCsw7](http://archive.is/CCsw7#selection-405.0-405.9) Listening podcast episode,""Four New Insights Coronavirus"" *The Daily* CNN. Summarized:

- Covid-19 respiratory illness, vascular (in blood vessels illness), meaning although enters body lungs, eventually get affect parts body. Causing blood clots. looking pneumonia low blood oxygen levels isnt enough.

- virus *has* mutating. made virus deadly, transmissible. two main strains, currently, Wuhan Italian, Italian one better getting cells infecting people. 

- much likely transmit catch virus indoors compared outdoors. Talking breathing releases ""mist"" carry virus. outdoors, wind open air disperse blow virus away (compared stuffy room mist circulate around). Standing 6ft apart outdoors quite safe. 

- growing evidence young children big transmitters virus adults (because they're less likely get respiratory symptoms cough/breathe out). Opening schools needs done carefully, probably done.

Even shitty comment copied posts. DeSoto nice? family matters wanting enjoy quiet time alone beach can. Obviously wanna beaches crowded! never sure like. I'm hoping find secluded beaches sure hard come across. May stick pool can't find one we’re weird ones won’t let children around anyone.

If case covid yeah, weird fuck. course exceptions, medical condition bad can’t wear mask cause it’s taxing heart lungs prolly shouldn’t shopping right now.  Hi everyone. I'm sure may discussed elsewhere many times, discovered sub wanted get thoughts/feedback. means math expert, vaguely remember statistics class college. I've pretty fascinated data look pretty much every day. part job -- work employee communications large hospital insurance system Pennsylvania (which overwhelmed even little bit, fwiw.)

We've hearing (at least have) hospitalizations deaths better indicators severity actual case numbers. lag (2 3 weeks) new cases deaths. Looking Worldometers info, however, I'm seeing much connection spikes new cases high #s deaths 2-3 weeks later. maybe I'm reading correctly?

For example, first spike new cases occurred around **April 12**, terms 7-day average. first spike deaths occurred around **April 21** \-- 8 days later.

Then, new cases kind hit new high-water mark around **April 26**. next big spike deaths **May 6** \-- 10 days later.

Using recent example, US set new (then) high daily cases **June 25**. since then, daily deaths declining. Using 8-10 days barometer previous two examples, July 3rd 5th would key dates look at. turns out, death totals last three days declining. fact, declining terms 7-day moving average since **June 2**.

So mean? I'm sure. I'm either ""side"" (which ridiculous sides, 'Merica guess). I'm pragmatic person like diving data. could way takeaways here, trust many way smarter random 35-year old guy! strong sentiment ""everywhere else dumb, we'll right"" now, while, yes, seem like southern half country dumb fuck

Only need 10% population dumb damage. Lots places trouble :( belongs r/facepalm painted many miniatures.. built many little houses, bridges, wind water mills, forests im building castle... last time touched model 20 years ago(i bought sporadicaly still boxed tho) wondering da f comes games workshop minis... also bought whole lot 3d printed minis... staying away crowds closed spaces since late january/early february...went jogging occasionaly keep kardio fresh days im going summer house(altho live 3m shore split croatia) mighty Swedish passport fallen. :/ like, one power consider allowing virus spread 'controlled burn' rate would lead much higher burden infection cause countries chose suppression / Test, Trace, Isolate keep borders closed one developed EU nation opted herd immunity? No? not? Seems absurd. 

Speaking absurd, TUI trying *sneak* tourists Greece terrible, terrible look. people worried comes making exceptions Swedish tourists, give cm they'll try take kilometer. Cool Greed literally killing us. cannot ok this. Explain wasting time. 

What waste time you? 'Own' body. Without mask threat others well may willing get virus are. People like reason country topping charts u/summariser_bot seen study posted several times people post idea read information inside study. Easy, commit felony choosing Good see slow steady reopening. Show rest country done. Well thank you. Running articles post stuff friday? Nothing said new. It’s well documented students better person learning (arguments often used homeschooling online charter schools). However, person learning better doesn’t mean it’s okay disregard pandemic. issue pandemic homeschooling vs regular school. It’s frustrating. really feel parents child’s pain death Covid completely minimized. I’m also concerned inner city urban districts open back impoverished areas parents students health afflictions. that’s addressing teacher staff concerns. ""Everyone wearing masks me!"" irony. Excellent! Have, good I’m nurse hospital still don’t get work home. However, light nonexistent social schedule relief. I’m less stressed sure older person told heard someone nurse said someone came hospital procedure tested positive coronavirus labeled coronavirus patient. guess expected shocked evidence really bad, cover hospital gets money? hospital do? label known positive coronavirus patient? mention huge difference South North Sweden. sparsely populated north much higher risk case big outbreaks, community hospitals capacity take proper care patients.
Luckily Swedish people fully stupid quite lot looked Norway rest world implemented ""lockdown"" That’s fuckin outrageous. That’s fact haven’t received anything crime. wife waited 2 months randomly got lump sum deposited account. There's handful kinase inhibitors market, anywhere hundreds thousands dollars (under $10k) per dose cost. Yeah bodies street detrimental economy well... Would make hard enjoy Denny's meal Haha like states seeing increases ""pneumonia"" deaths rates 500-800% higher 5 year average anything.

Those extra 30,000 deaths higher expected also totally caused car accidents roads people outside last 6 months 0 lockdowns. recovering leg injury (nothing serious bad sprain) BJJ gym reopened. Smaller classes like 8 people so. thought well bad. find two people got popped Corona. Unsure gym elsewhere still... pretty scary. making want go. However know dodge forever. essential worker deals international travelers. Granted wear mask 100% gloves theh wear sort mask, think matter time everyone gets it. Yeah, think hard pull US, choice guess Thanks! Today first day. Hopefully death march. 😁 also asked parents Shawn Hornbeck* sexually abused air front audience. Oprah POS. none business, sensitive topic child might wanted whole world know. 

*He kidnapped held captive while. honestly really go beaches St. Pete except Fort DeSoto. like beaches lots people. noticed DeSoto Weekday way less busy. DeSoto general also seems open space beaches St. Pete Beach/Treasure Island/etc

Hopefully sorta helped you. yes weekdays less busy ware mask slow spread save vulnerable people. problem probably lack empathy. 9/11 way USA tighten border create animosity towards middle eastern people whole, give reason decimate nations rich oil. ""avenging"" 9/11 ""Attacks"". countries want open borders, uncertainty higher infection rates Sweden whole, probably hard act local level. Oslo, area Norwegians crossing border would come from, twice many cases/capita Strömstad, meaning Sweden probably put higher risk Norway allowing people go back forth. course, would hard control crosses border, problem lies. seen Norway opening border high risk areas though, presumably they've prioritized things keeping infection risk  Sweet, stupidity lead virus proliferating unfettered across country retarded fellow Americans are...now covid going make even retards! Yay!


***FUCK!*** wish country well. Peru last year time enjoying much Peru offer. hope return again. Stay well. Georgia State student second this. Fuck USG Kemp Covid Patients undergoing surgery need identified anesthesiologist need manage airway, anesthesiologist probably last person want infect - airway management high risk viral transmission practitioner patient. Also, undergoing surgery, Covid could put additional risk providers need pay extra attention issues like preventing blood clots, even totally asymptomatic. positive optimistic. lose liquor license Regular actors make best crisis actors spend less tim worrying things control disagree all. reality is, businesses need find way make money state governors facing pressure since Federal Government helping much anymore. Yeah, California reopened slightly earlier starting well giving pressure, reopened (6+ weeks) things fine. Obviously things start surge again, imagine they'd shift back Phase 2 pretty quickly. think. I'd love company cut footprint half. could come 1-2 times/week share office someone opposite schedule. could save boatloads money real estate. Well finally got em. really is. many Sweden acting though deaths hospital admissions going now, worst sure there's nothing left worry about. 

But! least *very* strong signals least attempt made switch Test, Trace, Isolate. good least. know flat? Long term / permanent internal damage. know was, reasons news keep appearing news feed past couple weeks. thought things looking him. Sorry hear passed away sounds like put good fight family. build wall /s Don’t forget Ruby Princess started initial spike one Canadian singer died. leg amputated blood clot caused COVID so....

Yes. singular unique horror story.

Doctors saying people 4th good predictor next months go; screwed article correction, read lol Yes, I'm Latin America good public transportation, sprawling. confortable, think less greenhouse gases. Thank you. 

I linked article gtfo guy reported form removed made look like idiot interrupt circlejerk now. Feelings facts. true one vaccine already development years, replacing novel virus instead SARS1. sure good amount information. Also vaccines nearly invasive German model. mean undocumented workers, right? School, playing people, going playgrounds, summer camps. Feel like needs South Park episode making fun conspiracy nuts seem think everyone side political alignment automatically pedo. That's great! I'd like add non profit's yard community park benefited free time. Weeding great exercise. I’d lying said wasnt though, fucked earn money nothing last 6 years I’ve spent busting ass? absolutely

Long time like gives time really reflect life plan best future, besides getting best shape I’ve ever also able make conscious decision go back finish school fall. know fact neither would’ve happened still working full time job hated. Yeah year shit. Especially along Great Lakes. Snow rain year. get ""good"" weather 4 months, one cares. 

I think people way thinking hunker winter anyway that's COVID tamp naturally. thinking (or caring) right now. negligent way thinking people currently though ripple winter. People push enjoying long allowed. really think managing masks shit one listen they're forced (shut bars, restaurants, beaches, extracurriculars, etc again). Even then, done large scale, people travel able want. 

America mess. Obviously aren’t comprehending. loved fact don’t places every day right school. don’t ass early every morning. actually SEE kids day. Go back reread original post. I’m lucky easy going kids happy, healthy, making best situation. course we’re ready get back normal, although may cut back activities see much. SORRY enjoying major bonding time kids. 

By way, you’re sad, sick person tell someone they’re close abusing children based sentences Reddit. put link comment again: yes, said comment remarkable incredibly obeisant authority Swedes proven whole. Thanks kind words. still hard believe happened. It’s weird theory children don’t spread this. I’ve never understood reasoning completely, get got data countries beginning I’ve never felt like correct conclusion children spread everything else except extremely contagious virus. Unfortunately, simply isn’t way minimum wage workers sanitize things properly movie theater bar. usually young inexperienced, places probably can’t even afford PPE enhanced cleaning anyway. End result? 16yo wiping table pandemic hoping it’s good enough. Hero. understand change? improvement mental health teenager summer camp last week amaaaazing. really need real physical social interaction. end gen x got 2000 tech crash, 2008 now. boomer presidents. change. feeling ok? friend acts like sweden. brink breakdown due corona. 

Just wanna make sure ok do! think finding way homeless increase risk death (as opposed risk dying Covid) would difficult, best.

 Harder female. harder yet kids. 

If feel like would viable option you, I'm really happy you. consider might dangerous option others.

Personally, I'm you. enough survival training live land months, least. also recognize everyone streets probably dangerous classroom. ""If build it, come"".

If open gyms, people assume safe go workout. Without masks.

Thats happened roommate. cared lockdown gym would open back up. opened again, right away. Thats people prioritize things. Yes it’s quite depressing. I’m Ukraine people didn’t cars, even villages, public transit good. it’s money, poor countries wonderful transit, US. I’m originally Texas love state people I’m friends fb still live insane. many posts they’re adults don’t need told wear mask, stay home, etc. I’m like ya that’s great all, apparently need told lol.  yes. administrators it. give shit it, can't even track changes person's case, job. lol. Right! lot talk importance kids back school, don’t disagree that, idea going something soon? I’ve also read children don’t spread virus know stopped schools Covid hit schools?

Is chance we’ll see another spike cases schools resume. 
In schools, time stomach bug, colds, flu spreads quickly building. 

I’m worried educators. Studies great, studies also done assumptions, could quite bit rosy would actually occur. entirely possible could save money, also entirely possible could miss astronomical increase cost, example report going doctor 1-2 times year currently may begin going 5-6 able to. Sure could lead better preventative health, could also lead hypochondriac-chase. shitty situation, I’m sorry :( think anything I’ll sure DM you! Hope you’re hanging there. Wishing best! Leg amputated? for? hardly sounds COVID-related... might even throw coupon movie theatre! even close true, wearing masks.

 

 

 Ugh, I'm surprised sadly! There's quite lot anecdotes like that. sad say mark times changing. New York alone beating numbers 2k deaths day. Let's take seriously several states once. Nah, Trump's plan along, completely fuck corona virus response let hundreds thousands Americans die Mexico would finally end paying wall. exact partisan bullshit expected. favor go backpack europe rather take bad job. bad job resume takes years correct. way better sound like sowing oats gajning life experience. debate reason, need information hope come back bite later. [The documentary Yeah, glad Italy turned private jet away last week. We're time bomb need bring others us Well time noticed Dick Cheney guy 8 stories tall crustacean protozoic era 20% people hospitalized... Yeah guess that's bad /s “about quarter report fairly lax approach mask-wearing, saying ""sometimes,"" rarely"" ""never"" wear one, compared 7% said nation vigilant early April.”

I don’t believe numbers jive see go out.  people lie polls? people stop dying sweden?

Because measures restrictions place, place since early March, enough flatten curve dampen spread.

Also, look total mortality per flu season, 2018/19 mildest flu season 20 years Sweden, even covid-19 deaths, 2019/20 flu season *still average* mortality. another explanation statistically likely die people dead, there's many virus kill. Dont think going happen unless absolutely fucked Seems racist. Thank recognising privilege. someone gives better answer

The studies concluded virus lives long periods time different surfaces infective used amounts virus much higher see real life results much longer 100% fill that's many medical professionals sounding alarms right now.  Hospital space finite, infinite tone deaf governor's I'd expect coupon one free round drinks bar. strong disagreement Sweden triage. One geratics doctor linked called ""active euthanasia"" since thinks many triaged could survived. example linked clearly shows least initially selected triage appropriately selected since recovered healthy now. agreed. get spend every day family, get work home. get exercise, play basketball, spend time cat. dont worry look people think me. kind like living like child again.

my heart goes people struggling though. Tried read article. Unfortunately, cannot read Swedish. results false positives, false negatives, both? wouldn't. act like medical staff can't keep track stuff like this. would take minutes per case worst.

So think “medical staff” United States keep track severity millions coronavirus cases every day also regular jobs? Without extra pay? going build significant muscle also dropping weight. Embrace cardio hit goal weight. spend time family case infectious. Instead spent time work alone room. like subreddit won’t allow news China hiding investigators. 

Yesterday former head MI6 said thinks theory coronavirus came Chinese lab seriously considered.  word Chinese run subreddit though. Well time noticed Dick Cheney guy 8 stories tall crustacean protozoic era! Again, misunderstanding point. never even opined 'the point' vaccination. say 'obtuse'. One time, nice chatting. Honestly cutting carbs really helped beer cravings well body adjusted. must part body also jsut wants carbs beer. Americans first, Africans second presume. General consensus deaths lag weeks behind. that's correct deaths start rise. People catch COVID die day, takes 4-6 weeks die. Hospitals better prepared hopefuly help keep deaths low. counted “recovered” include people needed bilateral lung transplants, limb amputations, treatment chronic cardiac arrhythmias dangerously thick blood.

All outcomes incredibly rare. 

We already 1.2 million people Covid. cant go re-write history suggest need lung transplants amputations. Well, well, well. consequences actions. reminds Trump first becoming POTUS. Unbelievable obvious isnt going end well, time almost hilarious Americans let things get bad. sure cry laugh. Oh well. Fuck it. One bigger bordercrossings tradevise north norway less infections death norway. (västerbotten)

Actually, border regions less infections, long stockhomers dont come visit. 

Its also region allowed travel denmark. distancing protests? 🤦‍♂️

Yes. Many protests social distancing *with* stations set distribute masks sanitizer. Hell, almost every leader attending pressured social distancing. mere fact held outdoors another indicator slowed otherwise disastrous spread things. still spread? Sure. act like precautions taken example bad faith. think everyone gullible uninformed you?

Are speaking mirror something? Never seen wartime president surrender quickly. anyone asked mental health professionals want go dangerous situations?

I'm sure would love sort opportunity. asked making assumptions behalf mental health professionals? know, thing problem others doing. electoral college greatly suppresses votes states super red blue. I've lived knew people cared basically never voted voted primary knew vote meant nothing us saying months now. see shit show Canada ... saw people blocking rail lines shutting CN impacting commerce Canada .

He Prime Minister tourist. 

They go G7 G20 summitts.
Amid chaos.

We one Toronto .


He afraid set foot US soil.

Question - ? Good. White House petri dish virus. amazing someone would watch shitshow Brexit say ""yeah, let's that, tie shitshow similar name"". Yeah noisy neighbor lives pineapple sea. worry, lots people do. Years ago (pre-smartphone) long discussion couple Brits trying passionately tell wasn't. England time Loonie prove it. weird seeing beaches completely empty, pretty much everyone knew went BBQ 15 20 people kinda defeated purpose lol. No, sure did.

However, outside sunlight heat much less chance spread COVID dining, drinking, exercising indoors AC.

Or forget President wanted treat COVID shoving lamps Americans' asses. suppose one might argue serves purpose balancing Executive branch Senate Legislative. would charitable interpretation. But, truly believe Chief-Executive's main task preside Union whole strict popular vote makes lot sense there. hard no. ""Fuck you, ugly country stupid anyway"" saying news reports also lies? make sense. still many people groups 300, solution. Misleading, correction Victoria borders Western Australia New South Wales closed. state Victoria coming Western Australia would refuse entry cousin lives Perth area. Easiest decision ever! That's happening right now. result nil. was, basically spot-on. Apparently particular test they’ve using may [very high false negative  
As plasma transfusions, don’t prevent infection, lessen severity acquired infection. body still catch infection learn make antibodies.  
 
Hmmm, wonder would happen getting plasma transfusions African Americans base found out. explained tests people medium seriously ill, Mexico high positive rate (almost 50%). 

In case deaths Health Subsecretary said count every death. really abysmal job think hospitals would saturated able receive patients (like happened Spain Italy), case far. Trump made wearing masks political issue are. claim truly infected taking test part ignorance *sad Daniel Craig noises* look case studies infection happened across 4.5 meters, air conditioning currents blamed. know someone air bnb booked Miami next week claims it’s exempt it’s “short term lease” short term rental (isn’t thing?) IDK property owner bullshitting that’s true what. girl obviously idiot going first place I’m really curious that’s loophole actually exists not. 2018. felt waaaaay worse Eastern Europe.. Next exaggeration theater... excellent point. attack actually post articles. It'd great started posting good news. know think telling answer, much good news well one would think. 


I much time day I'm interested need fixing (therefore interested ""negative"" articles) preponderance news still vein. Read constitution Populous II: Trials Olympian Gods Yes. Thanks pointing out. 250 US deaths almost certainly undercounted due holiday weekend.

Today well recent 600-odd weekday deaths become typical, simply catching up. make useless, useful.

Any one statistic useful own. part bigger picture though, potentially helpful epidemiologists looking big picture data. Everybody’s sorry, aren’t they, yet parties continue it. problem *is America*, works *fundamentally*. core, see Canada partner, see us pet. think sad thing Trump opportunity really address issues manufacturing China, chief among security IP theft, strengthening manufacturing economic ties Canada Mexico. Instead, he’s managed damage trade relations China also alienated neighbors allies north south. real opportunity make change could benefited us nation, typical administration botched everything way hurt us benefited economic adversaries side world. differences political Muslim majority countries generally autocracy/theocracy. government basically dictates sect allowed country. major differences Sunni Shia comparable differences Christianity Judaism. Shia Muslims majority 4 counties 50+ majority Muslim countries. 

The main difference/conflict Iran Saudi Arabia religious political. hate United States, believe 5 pillars Islam one Shia one Sunni. fighting proxy wars similar US/Soviets decades unlike Cold War instead politics economic policies almost entirely rooted religious differences. many examples history nations going war name religion nations religion. since daily number cases doubled things begun reopen. 

Most people know frustrated anxious trend definitely one heading wrong direction. 

[The outlook Latin America general pretty poor get time kids. Strangers spending times kids do, that's right

Absolutely nailed head!

Granted rough days worth it. SoCal, things starting get bad. Los Angeles 1000+ day, San Diego 500+ day. Schools expecting start back session 6-7 weeks really see happening either time person. expecting oldest start 1st grade iPad like finished Kindergarten Good information, thanks contributing! dare areas people are, pay keep rural areas going say. view Trump president never lost election eyes, even pretend leader. fair think speaking terms child development social growth obviously in-person classes better especially compared rushed online classes seems likely case. Schools open terms development growth question worth terms virus mitigation controlling spread disease putting staff risk wife got tested scrape back brain nose.

I cant imagine trump day I'm American. Last checked, Trudeau make entirety extremist-left. i'm sure making nonsense mind.   

That said, extremist-left DEFINITELY handing election Trump. combination cancel-culture, Extreme censorship, choice candidate childish pattern simply refusing even meet with/talk POTUS ideological differences helping Trump secure second term that, always thank petulant children extremist-left. could go disco dancing Duterte. America completely utterly fucked. feel bad innocent good proper people there. hope come alright side hell they're put through. I’d post think pathetic excuse mass flesh currently occupying White House would get removed.

Instead I’ll point far strategies haven’t worked well him. Apparently never learns. million statistic all. seems future death toll people care others. 

Fo belive god, think happen next? seems like old testiment leader fuck right now. Nah ""bro""... would hate would offend use low blows. wanted steroids would health benefits weight yeah thats :) said much better could have. really believe ""context"" idea. particularly vulnerable people he's like cult leader elected official. neighborhood block party. Everybody masks. Laughing spitting eveywhere kids picking nose digging butt u/undeleteparent Sure, even possible it. lot know.

I'm fine. got better really fast. actually never stopped working entire time complete TEA training rescheduled would lose job several months. driving school bus. whole thing sucked really bad. Valid capslock! Here's found executive order:

""Effective 8 p.m. Friday, April 17, 2020 individual age two able medically tolerate face-covering shall required cover nose mouth mask cloth face-covering public place unable maintain, maintaining, social distance.""

There's lot wiggle room there, would seem friend right. live New York, maybe there's update law, doubt it.

Honestly, people selfish would wear damn mask, matter handful people got medical exemptions. article nicely illustrated case studies indoor transmisson distance. add period .com news websites, bypass paywall. Like “ .com. ”, works New York Times among others. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Honestly 4. get late 20’s they’re fucking constant man. Group 140 MPs! may important get Trump office, fuck things even worse so, 20 years?

Setting bad precedents worse danger even Trump. “A single death tragedy, million deaths statistic.”

- Someone Trump would try befriend link us poor Europeans? go post office several weeks ago. I’m thinking, _Leave doors open_. 

I know ups AC costs maybe it’s safety issue, it’s also safety issue bunch people standing box. don’t know that. /s  Peeing? Pooping? real danger kids bring campus somewhere outside NY. big part college's plan test everyone move randomly afterwards, breaks holidays cancelled, students asked stay within county duration semester. There's also dorm building left empty quarentine covid positive students. Honestly, many pages restrictions asked daughter she'd rather save money commute. Yes, know. agree looks indicators ""one"" released. reassuring know already history testing trials behind originating COVID variant mid 2000s. Obviously adaption version COVID19 test that.

Still, need remain hopeful.  basis would think this? risks transfusion reactions negligible. reasonable doctor would, weighing options ""completely unproven transfusions risk transfusion-reaction"" versus ""simply practice good hygiene infection avoidance"", prescribe transfusions. nice don’t get it’s okay leader visit another leader following strict distancing rules it’s okay thousands protestors sandwich streets screaming projecting spit molecules eachother. populous. Trump wanted Trudeau show offered free vacation Florida, free car. Trudeau help then.  Speaking which, Supreme Court made ruling this. money come always comes from, city/township budget. physical interaction becomes safe again, children’s social skills met outside small selective social circles. 

Just given extreme change real necessity, wouldn’t bet it. he's propagandist. guarantee works closely CIA. read link shared? works right doses demonstrated many Asian countries. 

Nope - one study found worked. Dozens others found not. I'm idiot I'm going scientific consensus. trying besotted liberal you’ll disqualify info that’s sensible. 

Why make political. showing hand, making assumption revealed care politics want believe antiparasitic works virus orange God wants believe studies showed HCQ didn’t work done four time dose used Asia. 

All studies used dose? Unfortunately, endowment piggy bank Carolina tap necessary. Instead, mainly bunch smaller ""directed"" gifts.  example, alumni says ""I want pay $10M endow scholarship students East Guilford high school."" $10M + $10M part $5B endowment, spent one thing.

Next time see something DTH somebody giving bunch money, check restrictions money spent -- nearly ALWAYS restrictions. neither uncomfortable, problematic tie BLM general strike. Nobody exploited employers BIPOC folks.  Workers rights intersectional. Soon rapist child molesters released. Must nice live country took COVID seriously endured momentary pain sacrifice long-term success battle pandemic.

Astronauts need wear masks! Dolphins need wear masks! Lions need wear masks!

Next say, ""Get butt stop making shit up"" ban people either. Shutting people pushes preexisting beliefs. VP cabinet remove president major health beyond me, technically already covered.

Because he's convenient them. leaving jackass president endangering millions, get little money power. average dirty asshole. mean masks outdoors kind pointless. lack distancing real problem. don’t think that’s sarcasm. literally work US Good. Stay Chile.  Actually Governor General is, unless Queen gets involved directly, like Canada Act. Governor General decides go war not. Riiight.

I believe lack leadership huge issue, least America. media told wore masks outside fine!? Sad thing probably work lot people. live people acting like normal summer genuinely seen moved part what's going on.

Come think can't even argue they've grown numb death toll, like care. case deaths Health Subsecretary said count every death. really abysmal job think hospitals would saturated able receive patients (like happened Spain Italy), case far.



He literally said 4 days ago Covid-19 deaths could 3 times registered amount register every death. victims die tested, tested post-mortem.  applies everything, final say level school returning person classes. reason got sent college wants pay next years tuition. hope reopen long enough make past refund date, likely forced close. honestly see person classes happening part. feel deceived government openly promised something utterly failed deliver?

But true enemy, true enemy mass people easily swayed bullshit invective. **Trudeau needs stand produce movement. fear restaurants near fools close travel town next one.  1/3 people introverts soo.. Proof? entrances? Hallways? Garages? Mail rooms? nearby locally frequented areas, like local shopping market?

That’s really generous. think committed random act kindness day!  area, pickups, first 2-3 months impossible even make pickup order due demand lack enough ""shoppers"" meet demand. calendar full even offer it.  Fan internet sensation Pluto dog? don’t considering dozens studies already can't class living dorms. mitigate virus? dorms interactions others repeated exactly said. comment even starts literally words ends with.

Since ? 
I hear used time (im Midwest, MI specifically) Fuck, I'm going live nonsense. title edited One model saw estimating 4-5x many cases reported. Whatever true number, definitely much higher official tally. makes conviction stronger get vaccine people waiting provide good guidance. brain, stopped listening back im February. like clear SARS2 pandemic trying tell people wasn't. Pretty clear thing airborne months ago. water wet. tiktok, instagram pretty good amount, seen 50 different videos parties 0 social distancing. Students done virus, realize probably wont affect what's point. I'm northern state dad hates masks think anything, wears one willingly required wear one. Why? alternative can't go places things. get people make big deal masks, like, throw temper tantrum want wear one get put time wear one get play kids. Take politics away that's boils to. agency said aware adults children ingesting hand sanitizer products contaminated methanol, wood alcohol, led recent adverse events including death. Methanol acceptable active ingredient hand sanitizers must used due toxic effects, FDA said. interested providing unbiased image, post combination positive negative posts. doesn't, thus looks like he's operating bias.

I'm commenter poster, see hinder pointing posting trends others, like right now. 

With said, post, I'd try provide full picture let reader judge things themselves, instead sowing agenda always commenting ""Ooh, makes X look bad"". lazy troll Kenneth - you? know, People tend remember dead relatives. immunity Antibiotics really affect viruses, though. numbers India? flyover end working? think depends information released. day day breakdown provided usually backdated. Lockdown 2.0 incoming? Seems stable. Many similar antibody tests showing results. saw similar ifr estimations UK Austria. Germany SK also around remember right. 

Previous estimations guessing infection rates higher. turned lower. Plus death count far behind lag. saw Broadway star died 95 days due covid(it insanely long processing disease). lag effect wrong infection rate estimates caused scientists guess lower ifr. check countries’ antibody tests many closed cases cruise ship cases, ifr unfortunately 1. 

Ofc many hard time accepting call people like doomers. yeah... Giving birth triplets ain’t easy, crazy woman could beat COVID still give birth healthy kids

Source: triplet, mom occasionally reminds us lol Can't blame guy. buddy buddy head state done almost nothing virus good press back home. Denial one hell drug people high fu@#ing kite right now. Best-case Ontario, boys ???? :o growth communities color comes people communities live average people per household, essential workers, people reliant public transit, less access healthcare including testing, etc.

If look explicit data anecdotal reports doctors, people Covid ending hospitals tend either “essential workers” people live household essential worker.

The systemic racial injustice protestors marching strongly tied current disparities health outcomes US. best stop Covid, society look protect weakest society, making sure every resident adequate access healthcare, etc. sissy. How's leadership, sissy Probably third stuck quarantine gfs, friends, SO, loved ones like family/siblings even pets . 

Me hand, introvert, stuck alone, fine 70odd days went downhill, 5 months fking lost it. Although fair isolation part gets lockdown itself, loneliness feels bad, someone life like gf sister feeling bad. 

Humans social creatures all. one good thing go work now, silver lining. afraid social distancing?  NY myself, people still wearing masks social distancing part. places re-opening need make $ survive despite better judgement. cases naturally rise, can't keep things locked vaccine hits, without gov't $$ assistance least. point assume everyone see public this. I’m pretty sure that’s already happening. I’ve seeing sorts state license plates. Thank you! Chickens. ""Hey guys, want go home Arizona roost?"" tried asking landlord would mind wearing mask they're you? literally today suggested ending hydroxychloroquine studies. studies showing benefits initial trial, although poorly done, showed promise well. given premature approval, given emergency use approval. different things. Ah, Ellen surprise me. need, Texans. I'm Joplin, MO, city that's news fastest rising number positive cases country. pass mask ordinance figure enforce it. easier dismiss problem problem-solve dole consequences. /S

So sit, basically trapped home God knows long vast majority fellow neighbors refuse wear mask. Successfully homeschooled kids typically participate variety extracurricular social activities grow isolated peer interaction. Also, huge difference homeschooling working families, homeschooling working **every** family, typically parents different, full time jobs. That's clearly going good substitute kids situation.

Kids access things like playdates (which cost nothing) bad thing, pandemic not.

No one saying bike rides, hiking, camping, etc., broadly, general family time, also important. always were. Related, I'm sincerely sorry parents spend enough quality time growing up, sucks. scientist ? Proof ? evidence then. Got it. Facts matter. US lost cause seems.. True. obsession masks scary witness. I'm Europe sometimes wonder Americans really want get virus control. Someone asked could hug finally able say feel like wondering nutcase. Saying normal reasonable now! feel free. entire thread reason nobody takes sub seriously. showed politician, rather leader leads looking science. Nobody said anything dismissing lax precautions. 

Don't put words mouth want let Brazil take number 1 spot fuck'n time alive man. mean Xi? also Trump hard know reactions respond singularly unhelpful comment.

Sorry, chose yours.

The US shown completely culturally unable deal something like pandemic. beyond control multiple states.

Your economy decimated decade more. struck, already laughing stock every country earth. longer laugh, pity. worst health care system planet. probably stratification society earth. Even call working class need multiple jobs survive.

If guys don’t act concert unite, every state agreement, matter ideology, protect all, many hundreds thousands needlessly die, economy continue dragged along weeds decades.

The BLM protests crucially important, blip compared this.

You need United group States. odd idea. I'm saying stay hidden bunkers, saying people take risks need taken.
Europe started opening again, yes restrictions, life going again. Masks public seen normal nobody bets eye it.
While time see photos Trump rallys thousands people single mask sight anywhere.
I've recently read paper one core statements was, people dying rapidly anymore mean over. ICU units filling quickly people still alive nobody knows long stay alive long term effects health. 
The fact people dropping like flies simply put mostly thanks medical staff working asses keep people alive overall better understanding treatments work can't. 
So slight inconvenience wearing mask really much ask, high risk person, might still put people risk?
I'm low risk (living cars, young, healthy) still precautions I'm outside, make sure I'm putting others risk.
And like virus exclusively killing old sick people, otherwise ICU see 20 year olds brought in, plugged ventilators.  Also, unpopular first. Many people ACÁ didn’t go far enough. 30% voters want right wing healthcare policy. Universal Healthcare popular. It’s basically much government involved debate is. me, need UK style NHS public healthcare protests risky, obviously antimask protests people intentionally wearing masks going less safe one majority masked. understand anyone could support guy. world completely insane.

#Translation:

The government chose path great confidence. really happened behind scenes Sweden stayed plan - made outside world wonder dared challenge death? ""The system ill-equipped pandemic,"" says Director General Public Health Authority Johan Carlson.

# Pandemic policy life death

The pandemic caused world's countries count deaths. deaths countries.

Politics part world often twisting development little way, rarely life death. Perhaps explanation strong feelings Swedish corona line aroused, home abroad.

Based memo notes, background interviews interviews actors outside Government Offices, Swedish Ministry Health tries describe unique Swedish corona strategy - would noticed worldwide - grew. 

Sweden, course, plan - completed days Christmas 2019. time, Public Health Authority published document ""Pandemic preparedness - prepare"". There, government modest role compared Public Health Authority.

The document contains well-known curves - steep flattened - simulations various pandemic processes calculations many die. expressed rather skeptical attitude non-pharmaceutical interventions, is, characterizes lockdown.

#Thursday, January 2: ""With wish happy 2020!""

Public Health Authority Coordinator Infection Protection Inger Andersson von Rosen sits computer writes memo notes telephone conference. notes outbreak mumps sickness Christmas party early December, one stomach sickness another Christmas day.

One points aimed world. heading ""Pneumonia"" Inger Andersson von Rosen writes media noticed ""atypical pneumonia"". 30 people become ill links Wuhan South China Seafood Market.

Andersson von Rosen concludes memo notes meeting: ""With wish good 2020!""

#Wednesday, January 29: ""Much frustration""

""Due event trend 2019 n-CoV possible consequences Sweden Swedish interests ...""

This call begins Elisabeth Backteman first time calls GSS, strategic coordination group, meeting. GSS, secretary state meets ministries affected crisis. week that, Director General Public Health Authority Johan Carlson decided corona virus ""handled special event authority specific routines activated"".

Backteman secretary state's secretary state, job comes responsibility crisis management government office. first meeting held called ""small circle"".

The summons includes heavyweights Stefan Löfven's State Secretary Nils Vikmång representative Emma Lennartsson, recently returned Government Offices - Ministry Finance - following expulsion connection Transport Board scandal.

**During February**, GSS meet almost daily. “This strategic overall view, follow things up. may need done. GSS coordinate discuss, ”says one participants.

	
On Wednesday, Public Health Authority grappling growing pressure communicators. Memory notes tell ""Aggressive / angry comments emails"" ""Very frustrated, feel anything"".

It's January - feelings already strong.

#Saturday, February 29: Stockholmers return home

**Stockholm's sports holiday week** - Sweden's second last - eleven planes land Italy Arlanda Saturday.

It probably day KD leader Ebba Busch thinks - February, June - say government courageous courage allowed large spread infection allowing thousands Swedes infected areas ” go straight community spread corona ”.

On February 23, temporary train Italy stopped passing Brenner Pass Austria Italy, fear corona virus. 

#Monday, March 2: ""A good crisis preparedness structure"" 

“I think perhaps distinguishes Sweden little good crisis preparedness structure. basically speak. authorities far-reaching powers normal situation, also take position serious development. ""

So says Elisabeth Backteman P1 tomorrow, day first convenes Crisis Management Council - gathers authorities crises. 

Her statement song praise Swedish ""principle responsibility"", means authorities, regions municipalities responsible business ordinary cases also crisis. 

The Swedish organization better countries, is. completely different context, days later, central person Government Offices reasoned highly benefits Swedish model dealing infection. based science, knowledge competent authorities. unlike regime many countries, keeps government - politicians - sometimes populist impulses short.
1/3 mask front, look country approaching daily cases amount Canada's TOTAL cases. Like told may worn many masks (although bullshit) locked better country social distanced. Everywhere. longer hot spots. country completely mismanaged this, good thing come fucked USA massively greedy pharmaceutical companies fully engage make virus monetary rewards, world part benefit. thosethings provide subjective benefit obey science told so? Yeah called triage. 

If life threatening wait turn line. Seriously, everyone pointing Tom Hanks Rita Wilson nice mild cases; described ""the blahs"". Thomas Jefferson spun quoted it.... people call ""the patriarchy"". people call ""the system"". people call ""the man"". people call ""the global elite"". end same. big club, ain't it. Oh yes. shame. Let's fix bad gay people right away adapting cultures gay torture murder quickly enough. shameful are. 

Typical. two small children 10. can’t say it’s perfect really enjoyed extra time get them. get HD pixel density... 1920x1080x1080 lot nanodrones Well, lived Los Angeles 90s I’d see Greek church I’d go to. wife wound run gyro stand annual Greek fest. Pretty sure worshiping satan. But, admittedly, Greek great can’t 100% sure. journalism, marketing.

Pfizer pushed ""news"" release press invited conference call basically fed story find essentially story *real* story Tuesday, Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. INO, +8.71% shared first data Phase 1 clinical trial coronavirus vaccine candidate, FDA issued guidance telling developers approval requires vaccine reduce risk COVID-19 50% compared placebo. day later, BioNTech BNTX, -1.35% Pfizer Inc. PFE, +2.28% jumped fray, sharing experimental vaccine generated neutralizing antibodies higher level reported people recovering COVID-19 news sent Inovio’s stock pushed shares BioNTech Pfizer. might end homeless even greater risk. people big enough nest egg quit. Methodist hospital UMMC aren’t hospital... fucking bet loved shutdown.

I got smoke weed, play video games, practice art day long, *and* got paid gone work government. Hell, even picked painting new skill, actually started enjoying little bit got hang it.

Thankfully well enough could comfortably taken 2 months work, scary beginning quarantine me, damn miss paradise home.

Now I'm back working retail getting bitched Karen least per day could actually something matters me, like practicing fucking art never time anymore I'm back work. Think small schools fancy boutique amenities– brand-new gyms, ultrafast internet, fancy rec centers dining facilities...how get stuff? didn’t pay cash pocket, that’s financed debt. Debt planned pay back future tuition money. 

Except can’t keep students campus, can’t charge pay costs...and since they’ve marketing on-campus experience cornerstone sales pitch, they’re scrambling figure compete (imagine it) educational services, they’ll need deliver online. Spoiler alert: they’re going fail this. 

They set luxury landlords created demand building school around it. Without bodies beds, school collapses. next two years going wild higher ed. don’t know RECOVERY trial data valid yet haven’t released data. longer take release begins look like retracted Lancet paper refused release data. Following book ear pork dire time survival mode on... know ignore purpose annoy occidental enforce way civilisation... Wearing masks lower risks. Like going protest lowers risks. Like working home lowers risk. ? Doctors did. Viruses plants known end 1800s viruses animals humans studied starting turn 20th century. assuming mean general population, people 2020 think fake vaccines trying control everyone element remains challenge then. Assuming moved back Canada border locked, even April, 40 days transfer plates. 

I see trying - reality American Canada right now. can't get Buy Death Road Canada Steam save 50%! fully remote since March, CEO announced permanent remote May. say, company really good us since whole thing happened, can't imagine going back office next months. small square feet refrigerated trucks beside buddies morgue fill up. institution contact tracing protocol place 100% grind uni halt two three positives everyone moving forward anyway. impression nobody wants one make controversial decision deferring tough decisions weak local guidelines means passing buck. 

It feels like opposite leadership willfully letting students worst, simply under-baked analysis best. 

I hope I'm wrong, foresee coming fiasco. go pretty often non Covid times. like Rail. supposed ALS benefit last month got cancelled. Appreciate it. I've going starting car letting run minutes every week know that's helping. Without shots fired un-civil war ourselves. two different directions country pulled. politicalized virus. ideologies kill us assuredly bullets. Ouch add comment flus like discovered time, remember also scientists humans vested interest capitalizing current events bring grant dollars keep research projects going. That's there's often much hype around scientific ""breakthroughs"" amount ""discovered something weird Petri dish may someday possibly right conditions stars align effect could potentially misinterpreted blown proportion, give funding please."" vein, account deaths happen, like car accidents, people staying home more.

Someone's going detailed assessment excess deaths, parsed cause I'm context, get good estimate. way cause death reported, we'll likely wait next year know year. someone legs, reasonable modification shirt, shoes, service policy would allow enter store without shoes.  


Not wearing mask reasonable modification person whose disability impairs ability so. needs individualized, case-by-case analysis. However, pandemic, direct threat clause almost certainly applies reasonable modifications made allow access facilities services PWD needs something along lines curbside pickup home delivery. course! don’t smoke, wash hands take shit, make sure cook chicken properly, don’t believe god, wear seatbelt drive, believe earth round, wear jacket cold... could go day get point. Emco btw :) haven’t. people still vote gop. Big crowd people, shouting, sweating,in pandemic.

There's risk. Thanks. That’s thought. know moved back Ontario since lockdown first time seeing car? “Lady you’re losing oxygen point passing slightly restricted airflow (after two minutes!) need medical care right anyways”.

""...and we've called ambulance you. They're way."" r/UsernameChecksOut  Cleanfreak introvert here, crazy anymore, huh? Hell yeah! I'm tired conspiracy nuts. reported deaths Michigan dropped considerably Memorial day (12), pick back following couple days (26, 68) claims killing 0.5% infected either wrong, referring different measures.

They're estimating based inclusion asymptomatic people. person AIDS literally die exposure infringing wellbeing asking wear mask! /s it?

Summer?

Warm weather?

Why people stop dying sweden? Cases trending since June 1 (35 days). deaths still trending downward. hurts us laid April May still gotten single unemployment check live yuppie part Dallas. Nobody wears masks anymore. Period. older folks that’s it. business establishments see masks no, complicated, ""complicated"" give stupidity consideration give science. must kids. Kids tend look kids play outside. thing life changed can’t go work. true fuck load people. Rates diabetes higher groups. Diabetes one well-known co-morbidities increases risk death. Admitting know willing ask help one mature intelligent things do. Nobody got today themselves. be? Great article! cannot blame people circle returning ""normal"" life, still makes incredibly concerned. whole saga gut wrenching. final chapter printout much whole thing ended costing three month journey... Yeehaw. Immigrants coming europe making money ad fleeing back country money stop flowing pockets... time brought back little gift. Well must blame misfortune America egalitarian meritocracy. /s

My guess, part reason handling pandemic properly went window. people fine especially takes poor minorities. reminds HIV/AIDS epidemic way. tell method inaction pan well. Look idiot, Toronto got lock 10 days ago, watching idiots Florida Texas fully engaging bars beaches art end April. Use brain.

Arizona never locked down.

Are delusional argumentative self esteem? be? whe thing hoax. /s Yeah, cost? would good news people could afford it, broken healthcare system fixed. then, we're fucked without question.

From public policy standpoint zero chance made widely available free Denisovans? CoVID-19's achilles heel competent leaders intelligent citizens. Dunno It’s kinda following expected pattern. Young people, like 20-somethings, wearing masks pretty high proportion. Pretty much everyone else - there’s maybe 1 10 less wearing masks everywhere. Grocery stores strict (finally) less less people without masks. 

That doesn’t mean aren’t tons suburban morons forcing way places keeping restaurants open.  yeah it’s still Texas even town idiot trumpists won’t play nice matter what. 

I fully expect hospitals overwhelmed- whether Austin residents surrounding areas sending people don’t ICU capacity can’t bothered wear masks anything. I’m 42 since March! makes sick realize much fast food eating. I’ve done started cooking home going daily walks. Marshalls. looked today went brands adding polyester stretch crap jeans. Can't imagine going gym rn, risks high. Home workouts ftw point. Even 50% population got it, would still significantly reduce rate new infections people still using masks public places yeah? legal requirement store provide reasonable accommodation person disability. requirement provide reasonable 'modification'. Lol, joking right? either willfully ignorant outright lying.

But right. They're going find whoever blame current problems. There’s really lot argument it, clearly crowding together yelling/chanting isn’t great idea right now. it’s binary either; outdoors better, sun/heat even better, wearing masks distancing best. 

Blaming protests current outbreak incredibly short-sighted political. Crowding stores, bars restaurants parties without masks distancing happening large scale since Memorial Day. 3rd 4th week July. That’s uptick MAY begin NYC protests. Back napkin math understanding takes multiple levels spread see uptick (which takes many weeks) shows timeframe next round may begin.

That said, accommodations person seek service animals required matter law. However, wearing mask times pass muster companies allowed prohibitive rules based actual risk. wearing mask established risk, ergo wearing mask required accommodation.

Yes is, inability understand shows stop talking.

Trudeau one Canada taking Covid seriously. GOP GOP thing, nothing surprising.

Okay. sit reddit pissed day another year so. Let know helps situation. It’s fucking sanity, dude. Goodness that’s scary. can’t imagine five random strangers deciding hey let’s beat bus driver. It’s issue police flagrantly killing people - disproportionately targeting blacks abuse - issue worth dying putting risk pandemic.

You realize live society, right? putting risk! note inflame national epidemic mass gatherings, exacerbate epidemic everyone society, including vulnerable people color able attend school fall result rising cases. Americans would think okay mass gatherings happen pretend would minimal public health impact. I'm embarrassed try explain logic Europeans East Asians.

Europeans back normal life right now; meanwhile, Americans wearing masks afraid walk inside book store. protests partially responsible reality. get staffing supposedly St. Luke's ready go. point staffing may run rooms. Always shove people need staff supplies especially ppe still low stock. Ridiculous. case, need take nuke orbit. I's way sure. According hospitals themselves, they're close overwhelmed. create ""surged"" capacity ICU beds COVID. stand point, they're 60% utilized they'll run initial planning. hospital county, Santa Barbara, took four patients Imperial County, ICU beds. Imperial county border Mexico, four counties away. send virus jail = problem solved... I’m surprised President AMLO messing up. doubt he’ll get re-elected. dipshit literally rebranded USMCA put America first. policy wise....same thing. friends went Kansas California.  hit road probably thought Kansas safer, time got Kansas exploded cases. Let sick second.  know who's stupider, California Kansas.  need people traveling anywhere let alone two states little control virus. Think many indoor spaces Disney World. 

RIP, Orlando. also Wierd know “millions” fraction needed. mask wearing protestors vs non mask wearing protestors? Yea, I've barely left house since mid March wear mask everywhere. listen follow science health guidelines. 

But yea, far they're reporting 4 children entire US. reported everything horrible happened children, parents would terrified let kids anything. Thanks want true won’t make so. Thanks UK train operators telling people must wear masks unless exempt due medical reasons telling exempts wear 'sunflower lanyard"" sign hidden disability. might stupid one can't wear mask due respiratory health issues surely travelling small enclosed space people one of, worst thing right now? Looking twitter revealed plenty people telling everybody asthma, cystic fibrosis etc glad travel train wear mask. 
I bet people call everybody else wearing mask too.

I assure America fair share entitled braindeads too. Sorry guy, case nothing terrible outlier. millions infected, bound younger people draw short stick. general, virus dangerous small risk groups. One unfortunate case alter statistics. know nonzero risk every person, come guys, easy understand people willing take risk.

I agree, home since March, along parents can't judge going wearing mask practicing social distance, can't expect everyone stay home vaccine out, know want start going safely next month can't imagine living life next 1-2 years risk dying even parents 60's risk low. Relax corona thing fluke, nothing get upset about. dear Astra-Zeneca working vaccine. Meanwhile i’ll hugging grandparents sharing pint friends. irony statement 😂 hospital county, Santa Barbara, took four patients Imperial County, ICU beds. Imperial county border Mexico, four counties away. What's wrong ?

Lmao, actually COVID rn actually closest describe way airs smelling rn man google trump vaccine 300 million, obviously things go according plan probably wishful thinking going ask questions wall building going help make quicker. virus even normal people. totally imagine grabbing random stuff shouting ""this shit's over"". long aware posting habits make come quite biased, that's fine. However, find interested need fixing (therefore interested ""negative"" articles)

a tad hypocritical, least telling whole truth. trend posting positive articles comments countries make Sweden look worse comparison.

This either hypocritical (because Sweden posts negative non-Sweden posts positive) selective due interested Sweden ""needs fixing"" (and thus quoted statement whole truth). both.

In either case, saying interest posting negative / ""what need fixing"" articles Sweden. 

And want claim personal attack ground reality, happy edit comment fill links previous posts comments shows fact. also hybrid model know would work college since main concern probably dorms. Mexico :/ perceived level risk. examples high risk. Wearing mask implies fear consider low risk. low feel give it. going sounds like mask compliance better before. People say stores care others enforce it, sounds hit miss. also area dependent, counties mask mandates imagine goes... hope mom stay safe, tell hang there! frustrating right now, especially people seem even slightly concerned. No, north better shape many people started blame border traffic. significant exchange people crossing ways every day. Baja California specifically believed brought someone crossed US travelled Washingtong something, back March. know joke, many parts Canada absolutely zero idea bagged milk it. 

Bagged milk localized thing. even worse solid form. Okay sure, difference 75% Americans 25% people UK saying wear masks frequently well outside margin error Lol surviving disasters terror killed unmanaged plague jokes write themselves. Correct. miles km conversion 1.609 golden ratio 1.618, differ 0.5% total coincidence works well. Girl, too! (I cut altogether). I've gained kgs. Also, indoor rides? can't see stopping ""It's small world"" ride every time someone takes mask boats. tested positive antibodies. clue covid, symptoms beyond usual allergies. pretty much gonna okay now? I'm 28 year old trans man negative blood counts anything. really. per article seems reason upon return Canada Trudeau would isolate 14 days per Canadian law. would disrupt ability job. dumb hill die on.

Hopefully people came senses coming semester Cornell Ithaca PD would patrolling parties anyways. fair, lots governments bandwagon beginning. still like Denmark. quite successful virus.

But spite government said, Americans wore masks Canadians almost every point time pandemic. normal life want committing mass human sacrifice generating legions ""covid veterans""? hell wrong you? wrong. US 401 deaths per million, Canada 230.

Whether safe another issue. would suck America pushed bad vaccine politically expedient so. Gee could've sworn high elected official govt screaming LIBERATE! twitter states right thing covid pandemic early on. grow exponential unchecked... inflection point even idiots deniers lock down... then, 3 week wait peak level off. Unfortunately think that's exception saw, saw footage many states. Almost police masks, maybe 50-70% protestors. link study considered reinfection? read seemed point patients clearing viral infections fully subsequent positive test. Bought plane tickets October San Diego something dream nowadays. I'm expecting nothing man I'd love vacation even though we'd wear mask.  Yeah, thought thing. I'm sure least job offer now. I’m probably going downvoted let preface question.

I think COVID 19 needs taken seriously. love state adopted mask requirements, sustainable social distancing.

My question:

Deaths COVID continued trend much lower peaks April/May. Even looking new case increase 2-3 weeks ago, deaths continue decline.

What explanation this? cases April/May untested? risk death much lower expected.

I’m starting wonder push towards opening up, find way protect vulnerable citizens. You’re still understanding I’m saying 😂 Close eyes imagine bus driver dad uncle.

Fuck world, man. doubt they’re using prisoners way *up front* they’ll sure hell use results. elaborate? I'm sure I'm understanding. reading survey seems survey 21,000 people/week individual behaviors. misinterpreting it? Please don’t use word “colored.” Son's pediatric therapist went Florida week celebrate july 4th whole family, including 1 year old, back next week, im sure anything stop interacting kids day.... son might miss weeks therapy though There's really much plan though, there? classes resume person, they'll go online again. college, state funded tuition- move labs another semester. everyone's plan B? I'm introvert, social pressures expectations - LOL - quit giving damn people placed them. Also, WFH since 2002. things miss getting walk around Parks, gym (open, hell no), eating (also open, hell no). know smell leave cheap water bottle sun day? bad anxiety late last year psych put chelated magnesium methylfolate supplements.

Melanie.... don’t really care, you? man far left photo, case interested. mask makes look weak would admitting wrong early severity. would rather almost die look weak admit he's wrong. He'd probably actually dying though, weak often wrong. teenage girl,

Shit like people don’t take COVID seriously. girl “healthy.” I’m sick shit. People going read this, roll eyes, start distrusting facts reported COVID. 

I wish news reporting news less making money.  go search 'vitamin D', seen randomized controlled trial probably thing settle debate. 

Oral vitamin absorbed within hours, people severe deficiency take weeks months gradually build normal levels.  lots family NY. People walking around masks. They're generally taking seriously. They've opened indoor dining higher risk things. also probably ~10% population immune already. 

Once TX, FL et al go spike, they'll similar position. feels like everyone stopped giving shit 100k Yeah, think states playing chicken other. None want issue stay home orders first, waiting states first. People die needlessly pandemic politicized. Redditors:

/s Per capita. They’re little 7000 per million. China around 62000 per million. airborne virus doesnt matter sitting front plane Yup... sure. weird counterintuitive move, there's movement among states form ""[National Popular Vote Interstate would use ability EC voters vote whoever actually go states' vote order coincide nation-wide popular vote. Thereby essentially bypassing concept electoral college favor actually using popular vote.

It's using power Electoral College make Electoral College pointless. love it.

As right now, 196 EC votes officially adopted (pending referendum Colorado), another 120 potential EC votes states voting adopting compact. (you need 270 win presidency.) Virginia's latest vote passed House vote Senate postponed 2021 due COVID. would add another 13 EC votes. Compact currently committee several states.

(also, total EC numbers may change slightly year due 2020 Census.)

For wondering works: comes effect compact prerequisite 270 total EC votes, then, states operate - giving EC votes whoever wins *State's* popular vote, compact hits 270, members' EC votes required law vote block whichever candidate popular vote, regardless state's individual results. recall reading something recently plan develop universal virus vaccine platform could significantly speed vaccine development viruses would cost billion. seems like ideal investment COVID-19 pandemic. I'm worried, though, politicians unwilling spend even small amount technology.

I can't remember name proposal, maybe someone else knows I'm referring to. Pretty sure talked sub. Texan, confirm. Yeah happened times everytime has, elector's decision reversed elector removed position. 

The electoral college ton problems, faithless electors really one them.  Wow, even get HD-DVD!  Guess US... remember miles kilometers Fibonacci sequence. Every two subsequent Fibonacci numbers correspond miles kilometers.

And fun coincidence. states legislature picks method determine themselves. reliable sources information prevalence post-covid infection medical issues? see tons anecdotal stories lung, heart, organ damage recovery can't seem find anything help understand somewhat common rare, relate pre-existing conditions. agree NY DOH reviews record decides nothing wrong. May option mid-January so, assuming US last long. feel ya. Good luck. Took checking everyday signing email notifications find bumper plates

It seems like catching demand some. honest know picked up. Could strip joint protests. DeSantis step save people Miami-Dade oppression?  
 AI check CT automatically.. already better doctors detecting cancer scans.

 Also, they've already trained dog sniff virus... sure practical scalable approach is. Possibly. Disney might able get insurance payout state *forces* close, voluntarily close.

If that's case, they're makes sort sense. Except play chicken DeSantis, he's fucking crazy. Help/advice/anything
I two month old twins. Everyone excited. partner’s brother, sister law, two year old nephew coming El Paso, Texas (we live Michigan) Thursday want see kids. They’re flying several layovers. makes nervous. Thoughts? paranoid? don’t want risk TWO MONTH OLD BABIES.... one instance think given pass. friend 3 year old autism. She’s terrified take public wear mask doesn’t want get yelled :( 

The poor kid needs get house back community can’t take anywhere. I'm sure David Pumpkins good guy. know open-up protests small big, TV nightly news casts made look big. anti-racist ones far complex included kinds forces page, hard compare. attended one protest march (3,000 present) single person unmasked. organizers Floyd march emphasized masks--all police masked. county really great since state order. Go county next door like order even exist. Oh boy, prescription death destruction. honestly believe vaccine end next year. Vaccines usually take years develop, lucky get 50 % effectiveness. looked CDCs website, 1 percent blacks it, close levels homosexual men.

But ya get cultural structure leads outbreaks certain communities. people didn’t get beginning AIDS. blamed behavior homosexual men high prevalence community. Covid-19 disproportionately high among Americans, people want blame behavior Americans instead looking social structure causes higher like sick leave example. can't measure number particles they're small.

So time best translation viral particles calculate infection. know time spend around infected person, viral particles inhale. Moral superiority nothing basic biology viral spread. Yeah, tried Target face masks? $1.50 simply tiny piece fabric holes cut ears. I'd destroy fucking display, too. Normally return something ask anything wring it. returned masks ask single thing, Yes. clearly unarguably violates 8th amendment Constitution. matter rich politically powerful country taken Constitution, ripped million pieces flushed toilet.   ""While face masks strictly enforced throughout park whole "" ass will. Hmm, I'm using cheap surgical masks it, though guess fabric ones might not. N95's somewhat stiffer metal bar fitted properly, supposed seal pretty well, can't smell anything inhaling nose mask (that test good fitting). 

My main discomfort masks comes wearing physical exertion like walking uphill. get full exhaled moisture, harder breathe through. 

I mostly avoid issues staying inside time, that's always possible course. need right now. see many people throwing around absurd mortality rate 5% don’t understand difference CFR IFR. best estimate CDC IFR 0.26%, number may go learn T-Cell responses prevalence asymptomatic infections. 1.

2.	 cannot determine *permanent* damage virus 100% cases contracted less full year ago many cases less 4 months ago. study follows models Neil Ferguson &amp; Co using fresh implementation. parameters adjusted different counter measures try match actual outcome deaths ICU demand. final simulated result comes quite close actual numbers.

There predicted number deaths unmitigated strategy, also known herd strategy, 100 000 beginning june. Lucky us chosen one. wish luck, feel sorry pregnant women right now, stressful without pandemic! happened AZ? Fuck. Vegas like magnet people money blow don’t like told do. notepad guys use copy paste comments over.

How ridiculous. AmErIcAnS sTuPiD reeeeeeee I've always lockdowns beginning. never going work effectively.
 
Do mean concept lockdowns generally? America? Feed mouse, nom nom one small bit hope, fact since testing sucks US, there's probably double even triple number confirmed cases US, means fatality rate could bit lower. Though death rate US higher average could undercount real death rate... could 1.5x confirmed deaths. infer selfie portly want hear fro DeSantis. *adults children ingesting hand sanitizer*   


Are adults encouraging kids drink Trump said  disinfectants ""on inside"" protect you? fairness, American, I'm still trying work fuck electoral college is. That's still optimistic Companies like this, companies deliberately risk public health name Mammon, names plastered every imaginable media outlet 24/7, shamed bankruptcy. owners charged endangering national security. dads pacemaker end batteries life hes suppose seen monthly check it, doc said last october. able get actual appointment since then. office visit 2 weeks hes trying make months. pulmonologist lung issues. wont make tele appointment waste times doctors like that. Ah yes, American individualism, definitely explains Black Lives Matter protests occurring around world US.  never ask someone died age 40 underlying conditions? Stop obtuse.  there’s enormous crowd outdoors, masks become necessary again. Stfu dummy lawyer. didn’t see much law quoted article.

[Read National Law lawyer, presume find acceptable source. milk california  true, again, i’ve read states contact tracers weren’t asking people attended protests, wonder actual strength studies “then probably percentage healthy people United States probably 10 percent take account factors.”

Yeah. disagree that? seen average American? also assumes everyone who's immune equally likely catch virus spread number people, that's almost never true, certainly case one.

This virus spreads rapidly specific environments, means people spend time environments likely catch *and* likely superspreaders. high level immunity achieved among subset general population, cases could drop significantly even population whole low levels immunity.

This might one reasons crowded cities like London New York, high levels subway usage, saw incredibly high levels spread early on, followed huge drops number cases seen regions laws different living conditions levels infection. live Sweden I'm slightest surprised this. remember couple years ago couple students talking worked summer something, one guy talked saw guy choking puke hospital. reason everyone thought funny hell laughed ass off. like ""huh""? hell funny that? Well I'm native, disturbing see many NY cars road right (in south Florida). kinda get natives would appreciate visits, particular case. 1) average age infected decreased, younger individual likely survive.

2) treatment methods improved extent, there’s less trial treatment going now. months ago effective treatments unknown. Corona officially change name ""Notrona"" It’s hard social distance Greenland would lambasted media hUrtInG eConOmy agree.

Yes, lot unhealthy people America. Please read Bogalusa heart study. Heart disease issues start someone still child overweight. 

So many conditions becoming normalized obesity. Shit, tell women LOOSE weight get pregnant many overweight. can't even see body article??? Research shows outdoor spread far (20 feet), viral load lower, diffuse, especially distance. People wear masks near others. Oh absolutely does.

It’s closer Sweden did. IMO Sweden also made mistake, wasn’t ignored science, looked data chose different, risky plan.

They would money if:

1) didn’t spend unnecessarily infrastructure projects negative NPV. (They still going those, btw).

2) hadn’t spent half balance Public Revenues Stabilization Fund last year due poor budgeting.

Funnily enough, money spend things like baseball (I wish joking) hasn’t dwindled. shows current administration’s priorities. It’s tough make states lock longer that. government needs to

Even then, least first couple months pandemic, medical facilities followed guidelines admitted urgent care / ICU otherwise exhibited underlying ailments tested.

""It's 100% effective, therefore even try"" argument? Check.

People giving shit needless deaths? Check.

Freedom vs societal safety? Check. month now, sub freaking predicting catastrophic rise deaths, yet happen. went “deaths lag two weeks” “deaths lag month,” it’s probably going get even longer. subreddit legitimately doomsday cult; whenever receives information contradicts catastrophic predictions, ignores evidence continues panic. Reddit needs remove sub front page COVID notification put r/COVID19 place. subreddit dangerous. Doctors jobs death rate dropping dramatically hospitalization length stay half was. Yeah think 10x recorded cases said scientists. Maybe less testing like NYC probably way cases Texas hospitalization/deaths arent close yet(besides lag time) literally said 4 days ago Covid-19 deaths could 3 times registered amount don’t register every death. victims die tested, won’t tested post-mortem.


Yup. accurate measure actually excess deaths. circumvents lack perfect testing. 

Even places like NY extensive testing program underreported cases. It’s inevitable. discrepancy 20%.

In Mexico, one world’s lowest testing per 1,000,000 inhabitants, discrepancy 300%, rightly point out.

It’s laughable people say “well panamerican Health Organization says they’ve done things right”. it’s impossible take seriously tout argument.

Same applies motto “but health system hasn’t collapsed”. deaths keep mounting. It’s said: “look, pantry full” half family starved death. prices expensive one buying canadian milk Where? right hijack momentum voice turn something else. can't like, look pissed black people, let's redirect anger something us white people care more. need general strike needs built backs. stealing peoples movements Right, first comment taking issue Oxford reputable not-for-profit. nothing either concerns.   mean sure,

Dr Vin Gupta, regular NBC news, talked resource MSNBC. evaluates risk quantifying infection rate, percentage tests coming back positive, ICU hospitalization bed utilization, contact tracing infrastructure.

I'm Virginia, across four measures considered moderate risk. Corona virus still spreading, rate slow. percentage tests coming back positive pretty decent 10% threshold recommended, ICU bed utilization little 25%. contact Trace 46% cases however.

Only two states green status outbreak actually controlled, that's Vermont Connecticut. fibromyalgia exactly feel. Aches time unable concentrate. Okay, reflect particularly Oxford anybody else could conceivably produce vaccine? making sense. Without vaccine recovered plasma infusion contains neutralizing antibodies closest thing immunity Covid. believe currently used therapy people hospitalized Covid. county breaks within parcel numbers apparently scary.

Once that, I'll feel better collect unemployment company. need able prove enough protect you. protected PUA California. also call state get shut down. wrong. always consider questioning something see claim science science said. God sub... Well, one *partially true* statements. new virus theres much dont know, hard look overall picture know people died Covid specifically.

So, one way generate numbers look deaths overall. running trend ""average"" number deaths location sees given month/year, compare deaths happened month/year compare average trend. perfect? No. show people dying would ""normally"", cause concern. picked one worst degrees possible job bad GPA. never going get good job offers. 


Go make money without degree. Construction service booming Yeah, it’s hard people relied gym. I’m fortunate workout equipment here. But, we’re expecting 2nd (last) baby month, I’ve scrambling getting things done around house. (Pressed time) advice you, would be, try rucking walking dogs. increases heart rate works legs. squats ruck sack dogs sniffing around. FYI: don’t start heavy weights. Gradually increase weights daily/weekly/monthly. guess depends overwhelmed mean.

There's overwhelmed where:
* Doctors work weekends
* Doctors work weekends plus extra hours
* enough ventilators
* enough hospital ICU beds
* enough meds
* enough hospital rooms
* enough doctors
* enough temporary beds
* Doctors start die exhaustion
* Doctors start die suicide
* People told even bother coming in

Which 'overwhelmed' now? know, list list get worse things be. someone explain 2 graphs me? track somewhat equally?   Wars literally started foreign bloke failed salute another person's flag. 


People get *crazy* flags. irrational point. wear bikinis burn them. Silly. We, country, barely accommodate disabled people accommodation causes slightest inconvenience. yeah, I’m going shocked affirm court putting people’s lives danger reasonable accommodation. Honestly point even something like work. can't educate people steadfastly refuse listen anything anybody else say. America free nation, people choose wear masks go crowds that's decision. mandates crap, people want wear masks they'll without mandate getting downvoted this, logic sound. absence preventative measures. 

I know mask situation Mass, main mitigating factor think of. don’t get y’alls hopes up... I’m praying best won’t, kids fine maybe get brain damage covid This. went subway live, older woman (probably well 50s) working point sale, hooked oxygen tank, tubes face, wearing mask. That’s determined literally ZERO excuses wearing one. Good job Mary, you’re fuckin beast. skews *heavily* towards later report government puts every day - Check age groups details. Lol, seriously? Get life. Move Daniel Craig, redditor new fantasy KNOWS this, chooses longer hold true.

It sad people deeply entrenched political positions completely ignore information know true may harm worldview bit. hope true, one study make so. case, high schools certainly remain closed. Same. Even killed 1 100 people absolutely nothing would still best make sure people lose loved ones. Pretty messed mentality 1 100 fine. people everything make pandemic political. point gatherings done people mainly right, far left people sub mocked them. 

But now, Millions people went protested middle pandemic cause people left want claim; find way protests good spread virus / kill people. agree hard decision. 

The netherlands denmark,norway, sweden open schools. 
And kids getting sick. netherlands kids till 12 even socially distance since 1st july, ""kids"" till 18 years stop social distance. worked catering university sadly probably wouldn’t even surprised many trustees admin meals ‘meetings’ had. Meals sometimes open sometimes cash bars, dinners open bottle red bottle white wine (nice ones) 6 tables members show half go waste, I’ve seen crab legs, prime rib, chef manned meat carving stations group 15... hired new admin publicity marketing something week welcome meals meetings him. Working service positions like hear PLENTY money going too, since you’re basically invisible half them. 

Universities ABSOLUTELY could find funding need forced to. Hell, president Uni could take pay cut (ours makes 450k!). Frustrating say least Yes did....your point being? fyre festival boat? Oh... things cherry picked? trump agree unfair worked Disney Cruise outbreak happened. guests, got paid, could watch movies theatre, swam day, events like karaoke bingo, drank bars, worked gyms. Wasn’t bad time whatsoever. Can’t speak cruises, took care us. sent home still keep touch people cruise, everybody works still gets paid. reason people can’t leave aren’t cruises fault, countries won’t take take them.  Nope can't compare numbers back March everyone trying tell ass hole ground back then.

I get point still important testing metric arsenal. saying goes, go war Army have, Army want. headline “Are Protests Unsafe? Experts Say May Depend Who’s Protesting What”.

I think headline overall tone article disingenuous, disservice NYT readers. None experts seen claimed protests inherently less risky based cause specific people protesting.

The factors affecting risk level include: whether indoors outdoors, whether people wearing masks, spaced people are, whether people physical contact each-other, whether people go hang indoors protest, ...

All experts saw expressed support BLM protests explicitly mentioned going protests riskier staying home spending time outdoors far away anyone households. said risks seemed relatively low protestors took precautions, thought cause worth risk. IQ 70 disability. IQ 70 130 privilege. People average intelligence usually dumbest. hate say (might come insensitive) but: NATURAL SELECTION! NATURAL SELECTION! NATURAL SELECTION! I’m sorry mom. Sending love way. Absolutely, data point, trend. 

While nice see four digit number instead another 10,000+ day, foolish think we're headed towards anything resembles right direction, sadly. fight. wanted u understand actually easy diagnosis ppl sick enough. list automodded words somewhere? Lock idiots wear masks. Masks going primary defense time pander idiots sociopaths. relevant particular country downplaying part global outbreak. still go reasons though. grocery store on. yeah, paid sick leave sure well. That's obvious. Right? bad need surgery land patients ICU? exactly rushed? idea reacted like this? normal reaction virus. really is.

Group 5 people protest Texas hair salon refuses close sub condemns ignoring science, 5000 gather March streets BLM ""Protests spread virus"". Doubt it. mental gymnastics still blame science Obama somehow. I’m seeing friends masks. saying “experts” lied flip flopping masks importance. see evidence even it’s true. ones left still supporting won’t ever admit wrong. 0% Really? I've heard there's good chance one would developed October year. long take mass produce working vaccine distribute public? Buy finger splint rest joint. I'm doctor worked past. Also rotate ice heat joint. ppl dumb hard take seriously (shitty, corrupt) world leaders keep downplaying every turn ""save"" economy. world fucked thought case. Equal access means make accommodation people can't make steps, need special seating wheelchair access, things like that. also means require masks protect access immunocompromised people. people sink low can. Pretending disability low. 

But, end even one people wear one, businesses still stop entering, provided make reasonable accommodation (like offering curbside pickup). plants protein, show exactly people ate. freacking universe even real scenario?

It is. U.S. healthcare system massive flaws. *But* good insurance and/or money. need rich good insurance, U.S. healthcare best is. 

The problem continue level care yet provide everyone. Well can't but, need better options. 

I know several people Canada European countries come U.S. get treatment. Usually treatment either non-life threatening improve quality life issue, experimental/costly treatments, include life threatening issue government agencies want pay it. ADA let shop owners shoot maskless. would horrible. Ati vaccine conspiracy theories worse enough now. hope find something soon. I'm sure even close understanding dangerous virus is. hate it, I’m one 40% that’s gained wait it’s hot balls outside live. However, don’t hate lockdown nearly much group introverts I’ve seen getting people’s misery. people boil blood, probably lead miserable lives themselves, things considered. yikes? It’s like staycation.  needs gold. *Some* deaths quick though. average span 18 days infection death. That's *average*, means shorter longer times well, including stories someone gets Covid dead 5 days later. one mysterious strokes heart attacks doesnt require long hospital situation.

So *those* deaths ""starting show radar"".

But US currently lowest number daily Covid deaths since things started. I'd throw IL well. locked pretty hard governor frequently Trump's cross-hairs it. Still lot do, experiencing lowest daily death counts rolling positivity rate (\~4%) since mid-March. someone tagged essential work whole time - otherwise empty building, bad - pessimistic outlook grown leaps bounds. introversion even greater lockdown become even clear there's less less worth leaving house for. (Certainly people, they've gone insane.) Coolio, that's helpful US demonstrates capable responding virus like countries have, welcome bring again.

Until then, I'm moving objection. Yeah, certainly oversimplified metrics. appreciate home state creating robust plan. corpse wall

That disgusting brilliant Yes. Tuesdays, sometimes cake dry. want nazi good guy stories dont ya. first protesting deaths protesting deaths. feel free refuse ventilators too. better people give that's evil hill I'll die on. What? Unless they're US. go back US. information widely known months now. Whether spread droplets 5 microns 5 microns, still floating air. wonder they're trying redefine ""airborne"" means. “High” relative term. anybody else get weird sickness later January early February terrible body aches one day? bones hurt. basically sweat everything night. suck unique sickness, still wonder was... Exacyly. Houston, nearly every COVID patient diabetes. Yeah, wild. article Spanish person lived Sweden many years throws lot light differences: lack masking frustrating since simple. said, *some* signals *may* reconsider it: http://archive.vn/x60I7. given slow molasses Sweden reassess failures, expect change fall, ever. Sorry, trying pick fight. know doctors time valuable getting stretched thin reports. obviously know medical side I; defer try find couple trained apes 😁 also worry make lost money aggressive treatment suggestions point. Medicine business. Presumably, blow want good stuff inside lungs. I've seen lot different stances too.. looked academic comments (doubt get peer reviewed scope knowledge area good enough know sure), looked backtracked known cases look discrepancies transmission hypothesized rapid spread within enclosed spaces aerosol must present.

I proper knowledge parse things like create informed viewpoints, initial thoughts viewed positive cases, must taking viral load account talking amount aerosols present. US elect politicians! know literally zero much countries wear masks, worldometer told quickly death rates testing numbers.

but population density determinative factor sweden really shitty job defending covid. population dense vermont (state US) currently 90 deaths per million almost double testing sweden per capita causing home rent prices skyrocket popular destinations. instead home prices tied cost living, become tied much money make pimping homes. people dozens airbnbs reason, footprint home much greater people would take even 5 star resort. also usually results town losing tax revenue would expect hotels addition local income tax people work driven become commuters.

This results ever-increasing tax deficit even made people literally getting taxed homes due skyrocketing home values. 

So, home values go standard living goes down. LET THROUGH, SUPER AIDS! LET FRONT LINE! Oh yes, forced labor hazardous conditions legal penalty. Sounds like wonderful idea. 

Also, folks making OT pay jobs right love learn indentured servants working job.

And really love part non-compliant people pandemic sent hospital. 

Everything bad, feel bad thinking otherwise. Love it. play cats, grill deck, take walks evening, play ps4 hours, get reading in. going clear data virus that's year. Many things cherry picked every way. vaccine US leading deaths. there's like lockdown traffic easy. Unfortunately still go work possibly exposed covid unemployed get paid stay home work. 😭 Sounds like typical case Mondays. Im glad recovered. Universities can't afford houses? Yes. fact noticeable outbreak anyone else. fact first people sequence genome.

If didn’t come China, original infection must’ve travelled Wuhan forgot one big flaw fantasy: fucking way anyone still using Twitter 20 years now. seriously! man health issues this, really hope death wake call people die vain know empirical, attempt distance protester's spread blame laughable. responsible, well Karen needing haircut, Chad needing party 4th July, Kyle going large car meets. same. responsibility, recognize actions good bad consequences someone help understand herd immunity thing? Like, chance can't happen?

Here's understand:
1. Vaccines coronaviruses often extremely ineffective

2. evidence indicate person cannot reinfected covid-19 -- may like chickenpox get once, like cold get again

So POSSIBLE could get vaccine works, POSSIBLE herd immunity could take effect even isn't, given even likely.

I guess I'm asking, possible we're entirely screwed nobody official wants say morale reasons? Well.... flu season. every year. flu similar symptoms coronavirus. What. possible? Mass inoculation public vaccine gone phase three insane. love Monday’s now.

Didn’t used start work week it’s really tough getting way back Tallahassee beach. Seriously who’s idea build capital inland panhandle thousands miles pristine beach.

But now?

Now Monday’s day CoVID19 cases drop like rock get celebrate I’ve done crush curve.

I mean look daily new cases 5,000 days. Show one governor drops.

The real kicker drop happened weekly months across country mainly due reduced reporting weekends, somehow everyone forgets point take another victory lap instead? Nearly infected also diabetes. better leadership would obvious solution day one. United States isn’t federal system world yes decided go 50 different approaches it’s president idea lead manage crisis. Viruses linger cloud airspace hour. 

They do. Airborne particles much smaller droplets linger air longer. Air currents also carry longer distances. measles virus, example, remain contagious air 2 think it’s like holiday delaying results due lab hours reduced many tests take days come back. 

I can’t even imagine see 3 weeks. Everyone partying groups 4th. numbers beyond testing capability. (To fair, think we’re already maxing capabilities). surge many die? 

I read sociologist paper put forward going take 3 4 million deaths United States fill gaps separation; degrees separation, people change attitude. sad socioeconomic paradigm important life. article didn’t say, five people know other? five random psychos? started, like reaffirmed why. Yep. mean, I'd always heard Sweden bureaucratic pandemic shown *extremely* much so. Well, least rusty, creaky gears sort grinding motion try implement Test, Trace, Isolate now, albeit frustratingly slow pace. It’s 1100 last Monday. literally political opinion piece. auto-mod? Originally, thought kids getting sick largely appear asymptomatic.

It turns vascular issues caused COVID-19 simply mostly asymptomatic causes significant issues.

What's frequency asymptomatic test screening public schools? Also long open? feel like one. really believe vaccine readily available Fall. That's likely expected. certain benefit running around day getting mild exercise fridge near. However, there's also surge bicycles purchased gym equipment shortages. allowed protest also dangerous? much Doomers want happen, people never “dying streets”. None posted papers support that.

Most provide strong evidence it. *political agenda* cares exception would endanger others, direct threat others.

You required wear mask, accommodations made unable to. (Online ordering, curbside pickup etc.)

There lawsuits ongoing, pretty clear businesses require wear mask. That’s CSICU’s for. separate regular ICU’s. I'm not. would love everyone would differences aside come together. fun make believe pokemans world. submitted day, link here: paste take couple days ago Sonora State government partially closed border state Arizona way prevent American tourists visit mainly Rocky Point (but certainly areas too) July 4th weekend. State Sonora hit hard increase covid cases recent weeks, local state governments imposed partial total lock downs certain Rocky Point depends lot tourism relaxed measures somewhat, still monitor people coming city. Apparently Rocky Point authorities fact turning people back come city, people neighbor municipality specifically city Taking account, riding border shutdown State government imposing, activist group blocking Americans entering Mexico much fear Covid way pressure Rocky Point city government letting enter city work essential activities claim.


Basically border entry point one municipality (Sonoyta), Rocky Point another. Rocky Point city happy check return people coming Sonoyta essential activities Rocky Point (they mostly want look work among things), Rocky Point city quick check return American tourists. put pressure Rocky Point, Sonoyta residents blocking border trying prevent Americans reach Rocky Point. okay, virus ""going disappear soon""! Like protests, outdoors okay. group 5 passengers refused wear masks... tickets trying bring dog bus. Methinks may played regardless coronavirus. also refused pay. Well thing would turn ""Oh that's said"" said/she said thing. always Principals decission choose trust, teacher Sámi student. imagine odds one.

I Skype chat day, sad comming back school cousin called give boy pep talk (I'm ""scientist"" family, yeah) told him, want's first Sámi Mars eat veggies, homework brush teeth anything likes he's older. 
His brother even used presentation ""women inspire me"" thing school International Womans day (honestly felt awkward it, also super proud chose amazing ladies history) Thank you, kind stranger! Depends part country. live people begging workers. Begging. Reducing hours. Turning fat contracts. 

There whole world outside hometown. Ralph Baric said zero scientific evidence this.

And, GoF research reimplemented US. fundamental part virology research. VAGINA KIND AIDS! KIND. big one. Everyone graduating next five years screwed. one going hire new grad experience enough laid experienced workers pay entry-level wages. Everything say correct.

Over pas weeks&lt; events like soft reopenings, protests, reopenings.

At stage people said ""You going see results fo 2 weeks! wait!""

And week later ""Just wait! 2 weeks!""

And week later ""Deaths lag! Give 2 weeks!""

And are. months&lt; that. death rate steadily dropped lowest point since beginning Covid. Scott Gottleib actually thinks 12 1 right now, trust anyone space. Straight shooter agree bit think closer 6 8 1 ration actual current cases current confirmed cases. gonna reason people think wearing flag crotch ass respectful patriotic? carry long term damage lungs, reducing lung capacity substantially (perhaps rest lives). Others suffer heart problems still others greater risk organ problems/failure.

Any sources long-term affects corona? enough time passed researched gathered state fact? That's awful. words put ""amputations infections"". Damn right. Loving time read Thanks. good!

Yeah. Unfortunately, Arizona following advice public health experts killing people. Scott Gottleib actually thinks 12 1 right now, trust anyone space. Straight shooter agree bit think closer 6 8 1 ration actual current cases current confirmed cases. virus care are. get virus matter political beliefs are, gender, race, ability. attacks human gets contact with. Wear mask. can’t, please social distance stay home. best you, dear fellow!  Gov Ducey: &lt;pikachu I’m responsible country 400 new cases everyday downward trend. death‘s also fault protesters. Smart virus Woke AF!. Cause science! people refusing wear masks would danger patients. Vote red restore law order US happend spain around Madrid 10% people got sick (average around country 5%) one aim herd immunity... get 60-80% 10% less 4 months enough overwhelm system? Sweden needs complete picture leader like orange man. That's stupid selfish acting thing. Disgusting. federal government ground flights safety hazard? would start stopping spread states. special way disappearing characters seamlessly answer always same. Money.  life tough. Yes, wrong. see I’m cunt!!! It’s MEDICAL condition! Reeeeee Name checks Good one could written LOL would received message.  Timelines fall/2021. oxford vaccine works, immediately start shipping doses(they're mass producing right now). 

The US could 300 million doses October. assume mass inoculation start.

For example, entire population netherlands vaccinated weeks( 3 million people get flu shot 2 days) meeting Trump pointless- man honor agreement deal makes inner circle infested coronavirus- Trudeau doesnt need put staff risk Trump photo op standing next halfway competent adult. Test positive rate 15%

Looks like test positive rate kinda flattening (it 14-15% last week too) sure. That's Marxist is. Umm peer review pretty standard form legitimizing data long remember; getting uppity would prefer adhere accepted norms industry I'm familiar with?

Or start road bending rules fit needs? necessarily fan way road ends.

To own, please look nose I'm trying go right processes procedures outlined experts community; good look. damn really end lol. Head vat state-at-home? statewide stay-at-home mandate? Incoherent Logic: See, masks aren’t 100% effective I’m wearing one. Probably latter. Vitamin deficiency connected higher mortality rates. unfortunately, people melanin difficult time absorbing vitamin sun. African American adults shown highest percentage vitamin deficiency. test people symtoms, tests presymtomatic people. 
Schools open month (sweden never closed theirs) 

0.6% patients got admitted hospitals younger 18. 

So question is; worse kids worse stop schooling/socializing. nation dicided schooling important. 

But everything open netherlands 1.5 meter distance play adults, also dont use masks (i dont agreet masks) exept public transport. dunno, week ago someone twitter called moron said I'm dumber gave credit ""This airborne."" 

Okie dokie! course! I’m sorry co-workers father. agree unknowns still large risk talking Covid. GOOD OL ONTARIAH BOYS THOUGHT looked familiar, damn, place face! lame stop lets clog site less useless bs cake days people know repeating comment great can't ways can't let people choose wear mask expect open economy one things happen. YYG showing pop late July/August months now. get hopes doctors learned treat patients since March. far, Houston patients younger, healthier sick New York's.

This must death rate come close saw March. bad people make be. ill take 6 5 odds absolutely way schools prevent spread airborne coronavirus particles educational setting. School ventilation systems recirculate air within building. MERV filters capture coronavirus extremely costly. Buses coronavirus incubators. told local district, students take masks eat lunch obviously. masks removed imagine happen air. Kids scream, shout, talk, cover noses. Exhaled coronavirus particles drift everywhere end surfaces. Kids return home school bring virus homes infect household. 


This prediction. 

This happen. midst pandemic spreading people spread virus matter old are. Fully agreed counts friend. Half us want end, half barely believes real. I’m starting think there’s intent reopening. businesses want open don’t care risk put employees through. Coming NV resident we’re still phase 2 numbers steadily climbing. 100% correct, also insane ""only"" 20% increase considered progress. great news! guess time go India buy generic drugs... Mask usage US actually pretty high compared western countries throughout someone actually needs ADA, I’m disgusted people bullshit. What? borders closed March doesn’t fit agenda guess win. 

06/22 (previous monday) 2900 
 
The highs week 9500 
The highs last week 11000 
 
meaning, highs week going 13000+ approx. problem Florida testing anymore need to/want to. Yeah, nothing related antibody test probable case counting methodologies. referencing? giving blood thinners hospital thats dependent doctor wants use treatment. people home getting blood thinners. No, America go full Brazil anything stop virus.

The baby Lockdown crumby stimulus single best attempt fix things that's we're getting far help. Can't drink right due medical issues. confirm. Boring AF. Sociopath: person personality disorder manifesting extreme antisocial attitudes behavior lack conscience. 

Like said, get help. Yeah, stupid theory gets trotted *every* outbreak. Happened 2003 SARS, Ebola, 2009 H1N1 get trotted next pandemic.

There *zero* scientific evidence this. Yea, think it. think you’re right. people already bitching complaining simple thing like wearing mask now, imagine people work them. course numbers lower due weekend trend while. course numbers increase week long continues decreasing week week exciting. feel better now?? 

“People look people, don’t end looked to”... worth noting Sweden made testning covid-19 available General public recently, mening neccessarily new cases, rather reported numbers getting closer actual numbers. No, extensively elderly die put ventilator, hence found ways provide oxygenation invasive gives better chances - something unique Sweden either. people idea flu actually like, “bad flu” very, scary concept. Bill Gates pedophile Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* understanding, too.

But know enough really speak appreciate clarification want everyone get along, want someone “fuck up”? blood sugar low something? Agreed, positivity rate lower would mean something. thing means today less tests processed holiday weekend technically one step closer death yesterday ones working gettingpaid retired. Othetwise, one enjoys it. quite easy jump conclusions irrational educate yourself. trying spread panic ""america-hate"" feel entitled shun people based plate actual situation. another ignorant Canadian shouting nothing. Define normal - seemed bunch issues already know C19 causes, passed away, C19 also causes. often wonder people dont take seriously idea go even managed asthma. hear lawn mower, run inside. idea playing kickball team friends sounds awesome isnt possibility. Want go hike!? Sure give couple weeks take extra meds lung exercises hopefully asthma wont bad can't hide everyone fear panic/be annoyed. Wanna get high? Hell yes...oh sorry edibles. 


I remember college still legal smoke bars would go suffer weekend. made laws people complained right want body...but didnt seem mind mine. 

I guess point maybe people saw illness like asthma, cystic fibrosis, copd etc like normal day, would little compassionate giving movie theaters house parties year. Maybe....probably not. Nick Cordero instance... taking away freedumb Sorry, meant Arizona general, could worded better. several neighbors bad luckily recovered. According several still back 100% weeks months. personally know one co-worker lost father COVID.
(Tri-State area)

The biggest thing scares unknown long term consequences. already finding 40% asymptomatic cases (I'll recheck #) reporting lung damage... that's people without symptoms reporting long term lasting lung damage. child cases reporting blood clots? 

It amazes people focusing death toll. long term financial costs long term consequences? 

Even entirely false would still want take precautions. ironic protestors background video holding signs apparently quoting Jefferson, saying, ""We prefer dangerous freedom peaceful slavery."" Ironic since Jefferson slave owner Good guy?! killed Wilson!! people KNOW Covid positive like "" Corey Hannon"" still go parties.

I 100% agree first paragraph, also agree anyone symptoms stay home, part true, please share false information, benefits one. doesn't

If they're disabled.. probably first ones wear them.. seeing chance dying higer 14.97 %.  Pretty fucking awful. times laugh absurdity it, times I'm crippled sadness stupid are. us them, need breathe air... I've seeing speculation children major transmitters months now. seems like evidence now, talked even more. That's science works. Information constantly change learn something we've never seen before. necessarily virus changing (although know mutate), knowledge works that's changing. better start overly cautious assume worst come learn safe. Ah, wasting time people die need trials apparently. Every day we're distributing vaccine 1000 people die, time wait. Medical ethics way conservative develop drugs active pandemic. Exactly point. Maybe it’s browser It’s politics... Well, experts looking can't hurt.

Glimpses certainty golden days. Honestly, pleased feel like dragging despite pretty much cooped since mid-March. 'common sense', cmon man. virus probably kills 0.25-0.5% whole population. danger old, ill people. want isolate, till vaccine comes out? it! leave There's whole lot American denial. shit stupid cock suckers Haha well think that's also part good role model sometimes. ;) 

Thank sharing insights! always enlightening. :) that’s lot people think - everything black white. You’re us us, good evil, etc. try explain nuance people simply lost. Excellent information. Don’t come yelling misread (or didn’t read) article says *lingering* numbness. don’t know it’s permanent. Reddit cucksville misinformation like get upvoted much reddit? just...so, wrong. best part said another blonde white woman. guys damn dramatic. anyone even read interview? 


*“Oh no, we’re fine. discomfort virus pretty much done two weeks different reactions, odd. wife lost sense taste smell, severe nausea, much higher fever did. crippling body aches, fatigued time couldn’t concentrate anything 12 minutes. last bit kinda like natural state anyway,” says, another chuckle, father telling monsters bed. ""* Could make strong statement tested many many times various conditions outside parties replicate results? addressed last sentence, value views hold application current situation? Can’t claim long term immunity three months trials. probably breathed other’s spit too, right? Michigan proud!!  Lol yeah agree 3 leaders enough experience opinion. Good fuk least live, things feel relatively normal right now. social distancing measures still place course, think everyone used way things are, panic sense imminent demise largely diminished, roads full again, people shopping, visiting friends family etc. 

I think area live hit hard far virus, could different parts country, easy see people could forget severity we're dealing with. false sense security, coupled ever growing restlessness...I think lot people beginning simply care more, they've enough there's little apparent consequence letting guard down. 

So pubs open, obviously people going go take slice normality. goes pub (after several months isolation) sensible afternoon? go socialise, get drunk forget troubles evening. course pubs full people acting stupid, ridiculous expect anything else. quite likely flu also spreads aerosol

They literally cited paper states Influenza also spread aerosol provide overwhelming evidence humans generate infectious aerosols quantitative data improve mathematical models transmission public health interventions previous undrluing conditions? 1% overall? Umm, paying attention.. unified approach: ignore virus, pretend going away magically, hope election day. 

Oh..wait..that one person's strategy. masks don’t seal around face well (N95 similar masks exceptions). main goal masks catch respiratory droplets talking/breathing/sneezing/coughing/etc. Air flow around sides masks.

That’s say can’t cause difficulty people barely able breathe effectively without mask. Masks create slight difference amount effort body exerts especially masks thick, wet, dirty, clogged, etc. It’s 100% everyone’s right wear mask even mask creates mental hindrance. problem people insist it’s right wear mask endanger health people around them. stores happily offer curbside pickup reasonable form accommodation people can’t wear masks don’t want wear masks. Unfortunately people bothered wear mask bothered work reasonable accommodations too. “We” I’ve heard opposite people worked her. everyone gets everyone. everyone bad day. long article, it’s really worth read. 

Thanks sharing it, OP. think data/trends showing too. There’s lot open up. Outdoors low risk. Indoors low risk good mask compliance.

Indoor dining MAYBE possible strict distancing requirements (we haven’t huge spikes yet 50% capacity restrictions here, I’m still sticking takeout/outdoor dining crowded areas now). 

Bars clubs people getting drunk spraying spit everywhere yelling other/loud music huge NO. 

My philosophy is, I’m indoors people, need mask. going get worse. Pushing schools opening back two weeks? open schools going get worse. already insanely control. ambivert, also paradise me! Sometimes miss going restaurants bars friends, also time sit read book porch! Kids still going partying campus. can't wear mask due disability, really going all? US straight line top deciding sacrifice people order appease donor class.

If lockdown immediately... may still already late. long provide immunity real question. One issues correlating cases deaths. certainly some...can't death without infected. But, happening people associating March/April case rates death rates. March/April testing around 100-150K people catching 20-30K cases. tests NYC area hitting 40-50% positive rate. NY churning 20K positive cases day. essentially testing severe cases elderly.

What something different. testing 600K 800K people day. positive rate (nationally) 5-7%. want lower somewhat cliche testing naturally going catch people. also capturing people different demographics earlier spring - younger people virus less deadly. obvious hot spots virus spreading right high positive rate now, positive rate still way NY's rate was.

We also developed better treatments.

Also, size nation almost assuredly going bring outbreaks certain areas. Europe extremely dense small. triumph countries like Czech Greece gotten, really areas asymptomatic infected people moved into. outbreaks there. 

You fit (from UK European Russian) continental US. US spread out. lockdowns reality strong cases actually appeared there. short, Texas/AZ locked people eventually got frustrated bored cases/deaths, people pushed re-open. Maybe masks beginning would helped going outbreaks lockdowns loosed country. something live forseeable future. Small outbreaks somewhat higher levels restrictions. Generally, virus need get herd immunity weaken, outbreaks weaken hit 20-30% population infected (though big country ever area hit). Spanish Flu example (and ancestors still around today). waves less kindling serious. 3.4 bad GPA means... bailing pension retirement funds right now. Also keeping home prices sky high forget home ownerships younger folks. Well poop believe authorities closing led QAnon Trump. One conspiracies coronavirus hoax numerous actors, politicians businessmen fake deaths pretending catch die gaining new identities process escape prosecution. 

All pretty wild. Region effect different strains mutations virus different regions ""Sorry, forgot mask."" HERE? can't say might disability. me, person actual cardiovascular disability, wear one entire shift kindly fuck off, thanks. “We lockdown forever” -priviledged 24 year old working home social life who’s idea friday night pandemic virtual DnD Open windows. Stay outdoors. become hermit.

I guess comes this.

Plus mask-wearing public reduce viral load.

Until vaccine ... possibility antibody test might shine light situation. USA. 60% wearing masks. Obviously places like NY California skew results, overall USA decent amount mask wearing. Honestly, home since early March still loving it. Love flexibility work whenever motivation hits, fixed time window. work productivity certainly gone result, interestingly enough also find time enjoy hobbies. Seems crazy would take 7 days get test results. need faster turn around time results. People obviously stupidly impatient spreading crap waiting results. STAY HOME!!!

(orange county, ca) cause go cvs like 9 10 people mask on.... 4th July like half mile later lighting fireworks 1 10 people masks on. Twitter people contacted employer NYPD. 🤯 pissed Fire Island folk, THOROUGHLY. people think fake get intubated.

Hopefully people crazy. crazies always vocal visible. fact antibodies wane matter B Cells make remain make much quickly get infected again?

Also, plan can’t develop lasting immunity virus? we’re screwed basically you’re going start throwing stats around hope cite data? 90%?

I agree article, however it’s kind hair-splitting. rise 27 days, breaking records 10 days. People really concerned that. It’s good news.  big box stores curb side delivery, local places too. looked nursing home data CMS. Arizona Georgia near 50% homes reporting cases residents cases per 1000 residents.

Of recent hard hit states, Texas best, still seeing consistent climb. 14% homes end May 28% end June. 

And recent data 2 weeks ago. Looking no, take trash. Hell yeah I'm state expand medicaid. really shitty many people. basically ""lol, die. racking millions medical debt since wait til sick go ER."" “The numbers great, going down. It’s going disappear like magic. soon summer comes go away. Great”

Motherfucker it’s 100 degrees outside still can’t go bar it. turned America worse place live Northern Mexico built wall. Still beating LA county every day... almost 1.5 x population compressed together. 

AZ governor ashamed himself. Thank you. try good role model little ones family, although sometimes want hit broom haha think mask hard, wonder they’ll feel ventilator. tell don’t use seat belt... get cancer, reason get treatment. things don’t 100% chance keeping alive. odds. bother? Eh, agree annoying hear that, banning people different views sounds like bad idea me. Especially one, since argument could made support claim too.

I agree it, think important include viewpoints. unsafe, levels unsafe. marching protest, people wearing masks safer stationary protest masks.

Look headline picture. may more, see four people without masks (two bottom left, bottom-middle mask down, one middle right). Conversely, ""I want haircut"" rallies close zero people masks.

If article said ""Is Shopping Unsafe? Experts Say May Depend Who's Buying What"" equated grocery store sit-down restaurant bar, think everyone would say that's ridiculous premise.

I'd say this.

Everything increase risk staying home, equal increase risk. Manage health entire fucking world? Yeah, small task. Covid hardly kills working age people. age range par much less dangerous flu. heard radio today Sweden making preparations second wave comes fall/winter. make prediction guy post something like: Sweden prepares second wave, or: government certain second wave coming. Good. Even diplomatic curtesy, can’t imagine could possibly gained visit. would waste time even without pandemic. importance #BLM movement justified accepting degree risk

This line people lose little bit faith. give us science without sort politics behind it. premise injects politics personal opinion conversation, people going assume (rightly wrongly) working backwards conclusion justify political stance. US unified cannot sentence True. Dieting, counting calories, eating healthy, putting 15-20 lbs quarantine. hard hit daily calorie limit (even reduced ""I want lose 2 lbs per week"" limit) without resorting comfort food!!! “No Cover Image Available” WTF! want see Syrian golden hamsters masks!!! Yep. months lockdown people following safe practices works wonders. US could prevented good leadership like Malaysia. don’t, we’ll put vaccine Chick-fil-a bullshit! hell wrong Administration?! 

A lot foreign students contribute important research economy. evil.   need executive order, need competent leadership national level coordinate strategy messaging population right things do.

Unfortunately, leadership. median age today 38....which actually highest since June 22.

lol? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wrote work.  Yep we’ve also 100%lockdown, social distancing masks parts. older ppl even village got memo shopping mask on. 
Lets remain hopeful weeks ahead.. Good stuff, get curbside. That's accommodation. YAY! uh, what? 

I firmly support opponent. want 4 years shit. fuck staff then, right?

Furthermore, can't average it. Clearly happening clusters. going read article see stats.

So kind wrong 10 1. ""894 staff members 441 children."" 10 1 all. Seems matter many examples thing tearing through, devastating whole regions, people going insist continuing bury heads sand. seen proof yet natural antibodies keep getting reinfected. best bet right avoid getting better understanding immunity long would last. satire surprised poor typical police marksmanship is. Harvard tuition 50k year key problems, problem. fundamental failure administrative level, even within state. governor Florida declaring victory rushed reopen state month prior record breaking new cases. 

The Premier Ontario much controlled response. Canada still much crawling regards reopening, compared US. Also, someone dual citizen say fundamental problem Americans, family included, anti-science sentiment, ability critically examine actions state leaders. also quite bit entitled level, led rush head back restaurants, beaches bars things controlled. Canadians potentially impulse given mile, rather inch, fact given mile. province Ontario slow reopen, hopes getting stage contact tracing. let citizens rush bars restaurants, made difference. Touché. better. Got it. uncontrolled spread coronavirus hurting restaurants small businesses joking 10k new cases every day FL 18-24 year old virile asymptomatics, governor actually believes unironically  Sounds made up. Probably best come see now, see family may persistent. Perhaps arrange outdoor visit, people wear masks maybe ask wait days arrive town coming see person? Hopefully contract anything, days may difference showing symptoms catch something layovers. way sure milk Canadians. Imagine voting killing loved one man's misinformation. That's lot hope! fuck trail buying sports car many lost employment. Pretty selfish expect health care workings ""throw virus "" people take precautions stop spread. Enjoy car drinks bar. Holy moly! Uugghhhhhh .....this frustrating read. Either you’re trying you’re not. Lots people many areas trying. Lots people areas aren’t trying. Oh well. intend practice indefinitely much becuase wouldn’t I? simply reality situation. know report shows. daycares usually pre school younger, older kids typically go camps summer. Keep mind Texas currently COVID hotbed, assume NH not. right? I'd probably enjoy shit lot getting paid $80,000 benefits such. Instead got laid stop-gap job able get hired main field nobody hiring right now. Decided go grad school like main field much anyway, yeah... alright first month can't wait start school. rash pneumonia certainly. people different risk tolerance you, might find risks worth taking.

That's great infection stays limited folks -- body, risk acceptance. Unfortunately, that's true. go onto infect people even mean to.  Im assuming similar things make meat quality Alberta beef. lot opinions come breeding/type feed (corn vs grass)/grazing requirements regulations livestock general. least arguments I've always heard growing up. clear know specifics arguments often hear cited.

I question - going still show admit wrong deaths come? told long death recordings take. I've seen people explain over, yet keep saying debunked stuff. gong disappear proven wrong?  DINGDINGDING! WINNER! avoided worst case Ontario! old people Florida would think death rate would skyrocket. opposite recorded.

Anti-intellectualism uniquely American phenomenon. happens *leaders* anti-intellectual, puts finer point it. guys always think normal? someone lived life EU, Australia NZ: normal developed countries  somewhat contained due off-season. tip off, full campus traveling, get worse. home country course doesn’t ban reentry citizens, international flights halted **at least** September 15th. humanitarian flights working repatriation efforts increasingly less often. would somebody get back can’t exactly buy plane ticket?

As understand, 8 years ago k US student visa, visa isn’t renewed continuing next academic period (ie. fall semester summer), visa expires literally day University indicates commencement date 90 days grace period leave country after.

Generally commencements end May. graduation takes place day May 26th, good unto August 25th. Okay flights country? 

You’d obviously wait leave records, would show remained United States status carries pretty severe penalties (including banned forever). 

I think kids situation would need case, go maybe someplace *are* still flights - like Cancun - 90 day grace period expires, *then* fly back US reentering *tourists*.

But course tourist cant study US soil, even it’s online. would weeks get flight home.

To great expenditure mention health risk contracting covid foreign possibly third world country.

That’s insane. somebody who’s never experienced it, it’s hard explain delicate issue remaining status granted entry US is.

People require visas don’t general visa US. studied, student visa stuck passport tourist visa. according stated purpose trip upon reaching port entry, that’s thing do. mean people try get caught it’s fuckfest - rightfully so.

Every clinic that's open line goes around block every single day testing. lot protesters also make point pass messaging on.

Protesters well aware virus impacts minority groups harder. Testing important protests goals. talking America Denmark? kid kid... seriously... go Denmark? Perhaps it’s location thing, I’m Europe it’s pretty standard least one overseas holiday year. get week package deals couple hundred. assume you’re US that’s don’t see you’re less likely travel abroad what? Would stop ignorant whiny assholes stop going public start wearing mask? lot people voted want ""Wexit"" (West-Exit) obsolete oil jobs magically fixed gov. Super simplification that's gist it. ""IF"". true. I’m NH they’re basically begging people get tested, even you’re asymptomatic.

Contrast alternatives, yes, look real damn pretty. talking ORF8 paper ""put HIV virus"" firstly make sense. Secondly believe referring control experiment expressed HIV protein called Nef cell line show downregulates MHCI like ORF8 does. called positive control, take protein known perform function studying compare new protein think thing. way links virus HIV.

As new paper posted, yes showing effect cells, I'm arguing nothing function HIV. paper study NYT article talking shown depletion cells blood. mean cells gone, actually NYT study say hyperactivated migrate (which would fit cytokine data paper posted). Also huge control missing new paper: comparing SARS-Cov2 virus. Transient cell depletion blood unheard localized tissue infection due migration cells tissue site, increase exhaustion markers also happen longer infections due availability antigen secondary regulation immune response. 

To make claims long term cell depletion ""like HIV"" would need show long lasting (this paper looked one timepoint, likely go back normal resolution infection). also cells actually dying dysfunctional, neither paper.

Your interpretations going way beyond papers showing 1. Yeah right bad, I’m getting 725% 

2&amp;3. Agreed, since lag 2-4 weeks, keep rising cases peak hospitalizations deaths beating expectations far though, hopefully it’ll stay way Nja nästan, skillnaden är att ett troll skulle vara en person som bara försöker irritera folk, det här är mycket större och mer intensivt.

It would require month long global lockdown would never happen. agree obviously incorrect reopenings would lead increase cases states already hit hard. convincing evidence suggest outcome, plenty evidence suggest otherwise (South Korea Iran). However, significant increases treatment massively improved public health policy, including far better protection nursing homes, suggest situation death numbers different. Case point, Oxford researchers finding survival rates among hospitalized patients increasing. we’re seeing is, opinion, correction ratio infections deaths. massive mortality rate NYC area beginning pandemic result inexperienced doctors, doctors time, dealing entirely new virus, inadequate protection elderly. understand virus improving treatment every day, death count correcting itself.

The entire idea behind “flattening curve” that, even cases increased reopening, hospitals would prepared deal cases fewer people would die. Outside states like New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, United States success story front. Nice dude spent 30 minutes Wikipedia learning Trumps family tree. Sounds like typical day assume _anti-covid_ misting booths no-no?

Like looking certain disinfectant % ratio may still make viable covid? (disregarding potential breathing toxicity/hazards, depending sanitation compound used) went Ivy League graduated less debt friends state schools.  alum, call ask cash, happy write check pay forward, fact afford attract student want, provide socioeconomic diversity two strongest selling points schools. get it, got argument mother (62) decided fly cross country help highschool friend move house husband died COVID in. got really pissed told self quarantine hotel room month niece sister high risk. beyond stupid, it’s decision really hurts American students.

A lot wealthy international students go college US. pay full tuition generally receive financial aid (and aren’t eligible government). tuition dollars make possible discount tuition American students scholarships. 

Now many students can’t go US universities next year. schools won’t get tuition dollars. could’ve stayed home country gone school remotely, least would sent tuition American school. that? Screw rest world access vaccine? 

Okay need calm down. countries thing US made similar deals AstraZeneca produce vaccine proven efficious. India, Egypt, Brazil, EU Japan far this.
 
Like, know vaccine UK right? Vaccines often generate stronger immune response disease prevent, use adjuvants. You’ve obviously never even held job think that’s they’re going through. fucks sake dude, pull head ass. see pack landed safely fire. MMA still going strong. beauty 1 1 sports guess. Yes popular Abbot tests almost never false positives. False negatives common though Somewhere Africa. Sob Gov Abbott WTF. Ay Alberta squad know agree Yeah. 

It’s complete policy-making mess. 

I understand people bent using cherry-picked indicators (such article send constantly, Hugo López-Gatell’s nomination part committee public health response, fact available beds hospitals) call success... Come magic kingdom kill kids! Sounds like talking economy order create short term optimism. Money guys getting greedy again.

CAC 40 still 15% start year, recovered half losses sustained March, time bit promotional push bankers Monaco set minimize losses cash second wave Covid-19 hits fall.

Classic pump dump. Indoor dining started week ago Illinois.

Texas started month ago.

Arizona started mid May.

Apples Oranges. depends population size.

250k individuals required keep producing new babies without immunity measles, example. 

So example, bat colony 30 k individuals critical mass particular coronavirus 100k, roost achieves herd immunity.

That major part oft neglected discussions. It’s herd immunity strategy could work homogenous, young, relatively small population people like military recruits, Norway, whatever. 

I’m saying it’s good way, it’s way. Thanks! normal language: We’re totally f*cked... Uh yeah, pretty much do. Let get straight, church ""covid party"". god let happen?.... right???.... RiGhT???? # SCALE:

**The US pop. 328 million.**

**India pop. BILLION+ 720,000 cases 20,000 deaths** Losing optimism vaccine eventually proving effective. Apparently antibodies wane quickly recovered patients several new reports possible reinfection already. I'm afraid going deal without vaccine. resident Tennessee, don’t see anything. believes “freedumb” point Governor doesn’t think power mandate masks. Heck, barely even believed lockdown measures. 

Schools open 2-4 weeks depending district. We’re seeing plans made public they’re...worrisome. Damn beach risky :(? fucking stupid. get broad logic “if it’s online home country” there’s many problems that. 

Like... home country much different time zone teacher lectures etc certain times, want people get 4am go class? want thousands thousands people travel back home country right now? many problems. frakking insane? article March really hope state mandate masks. 4 metro counties 2 surrounding Nashville well. start recovery stories US stays stagnant another 8 months vaccine. definitely VP contender Biden. hope okay! lockdowns for?

WE STILL DONT KNOW earlier today article sub says employers abandoning idea frequent tests employees expensive slow.

Harvard medical labs... Maybe plan run tests.

Or maybe empty promises. see effects herd immunity places like Texas, Arizona, Florida start August. 

Guaranteed.

People really seeing numbers. place like Florida even insane crazy miracle Flordia catching 20% cases would Florida like 2% population infected last WEEK. capturing much likely 1 10 20 cases much 10% Florida infected June alone. mean, wasn’t awesome, probably wouldn’t comment. Well would say central bank probably incorrect also note title incorrect. 14% reduction followed 14% increase simply full rebound math demonstrates. 14% reduction 10 gives 8.6 14% increase 8.6 gives little 9.8, i.e. still 2%. Ok wAiting. sub saying months. point longer wait ‘2 weeks’? Then, u acknowledge isn’t virus u thought ?

I feel lady. Gee. someone seen coming... contact trace people based 30% positivity presumptive positive, however.

I think agree central point though, contact tracing testing limited absolute number. infections few, test lots people using pooling find infected, trace quarantine achieve something like -50% R value. many infections per day (and I'm putting number value *far* less 1/500 population), attempting little contain spread resorts let everyone get infected hospitals overwhelmed, lockdown back within testable range. Also combination people wanting snap back normal, slowly improving treatments.

Bolsonaro, turned 65 March, said 38 ° C fever 96% rate oxygenation blood, said taking hydroxychloroquine. symptoms, president's schedule rest week canceled. 

The president already tested Covid-19 Hospital das Forças Armadas, Brasília. test result released around noon Tuesday (7).

Bolsonaro also informed **CNN** also MRI lungs. According president, examination identify problems.

In May, Bolsonaro delivered STF (Supreme Federal Court) documents according [three tests Covid-19 carried March president handed exams newspaper *O Estado de S. Paulo* went court obtain results. Anti-mask people now- “I PREFER DANGEROUS FREEDOM PEACEFUL SLAVERY”

Good Tyler Perry! basically like old studio lot days? Perhaps lead Renaissance similar environments. Wish best luck. So, comments reaching herd immunity 20% infection rate pretty much wrong.  comment. Never taking granted anything ever again. hospitalizations hit critical levels (and they're starting places), going start seeing even deaths already are. amazes people still saying definitively “you get once”. zero (0) proven cases this. long immunity lasts don’t quite know, know exact details post-antibody immunity, still amazes people say fact. Oxford vaccine already gone lot safety testing created MERS. There's bad side this. Lots older folks cross border cheap pharmaceutical drugs. tight budgets.

Without real consequences, protests meaningless. Peaceful protests modern world accomplish nothing. point rail blockages force people act.  Yup makes think even already asymptomatic case. whole population already thinks social distancing cases skyrocketing. THAT’s problem. People think bar 75% occupancy social distancing.

Any gathering, indoors outdoors spread virus, period.

The people gathering virus people contract virus gathering, delta. Places opened protests infected protests places didn't; thus seen much larger acceleration number cases. 

That change fact gathering lead virus spread. Even outdoors, even mask, even social distancing spread; lot lower spread would without measures.

Bottom line BLM protesters stupid, equally guilty ignoring science morons protest closing hiar salons wearing masks, inevitable spread every protest inevitably lead deaths.

Claiming anxiety reason wear face mask equivalent emotional support dog....change mind. Uh, 16 days youve produced 46 pages comments mention ""swede"" 1945 times.

A month ago also checked back 13 days produced 44 pages comments mentioned swede 909 times.

Before already spamming sweden month.

Claiming dont agenda insane fixation sweden absurd. see multiple people already gill-ty horribly fish puns. Anyone else want rise bait? would curious see survey taken. Since self reported data, ‘mask usage’ could mean ‘I wore mask store.’ Personally I’d take info grain salt. would hazard guess many places seeing spikes realistically seeing high rates mask usage. UK. we're around 20% wearing masks. need wear public transport, enforced. don't, never, needed supermarkets stores. actually know read thread, possible fly commercial plane already. also said couldn’t spread human human contact early January Maybe nice Zoom meeting instead. Probably exhausted pedo. People wake up! Tom Hanks evil. Censorship offended? Literally worst reason censor something. Honestly point I'm looking forward news Oxford vaccine passes phase 3 long lasting immunity something, day going world wide holiday. lockdown many cities, observed multiple families highrises got infected time. common space shared elevator.

There's link somewhere, can't find though. idea non medical masks protect others much wearer, touching mask time really isn’t going matter much. Especially masks ability protect people around mask wearer. **［July 6th OUTBREAK ALERT ］The COVID-19 pandemic situation deteriorating rapidly United States.** following 10 developed countries states United States reported new confirmed COVID-19 cases far today (will keep updating since countries U.S. states reported) :

Right now, Americans can’t travel Europe. it’s necessarily safe travel within US, especially come home aging parents/relatives.

OTOH heard single report like another Nordic country. sad shocking read people harassed wearing mask wanting keep distance. 

I'm curious authorities ever told people stop hugging Sweden? Denmark hilariously commonly repeated early on: ""stop hugging"". thought adorable. see advice Sweden, maybe missed much normal Sweden. keep distance, avoid public transports etc.

Things don’t compute. interesting thought. We're clearly unprepared society handle deadly disease. Hoarding would much worse society would actually break down. need protect food supply somehow. one would work min wage grocery job. What, testing tracking end-all, beat-all solution? What? obvious difference one case, politicians pundits boasting many epidemiologists, virologists, ICU doctors saying “We studied field professionally whole careers keeping latest research Covid, idiots going disaster hands another weeks, here’s ...”.

In case politicians pundits saying (without evidence own) “all experts hypocrites partisan hacks”, experts saying “we cautiously optimistic risk dramatically higher expected, keep updated learn otherwise”.

I hope see two situations quite analogous. Good. Notify Karen army! means either believe doctors telling him, much coward risk upsetting base crazy wingnuts give out. 
 
Probably honestly. Good point! hope fuckers rot jail rest lives. Somebody try bring suit pissed either video call wear mask enter courthouse. way go - skipping trials undermines safety deploying vaccine, would also signal already reluctant get feel 'rushed'.

Follow normal process, use mitigation strategies available. new way life isn’t sustainable wouldn’t allow us go back is. example, even maximal driving speed roads different

Je souviens pas que c'etais let case quand j'ai appris conduire en 2005. So, can't use certain words, can't know words off-limits? 

Some us would like play rules, so, need know rules are. Cool, actually attack virus way have: nothing indoors medical food supply related open, every indoor AC system needs acknowledged possible Super Spreader zone get every single AC system cleaned retrofitted Corona-cleansing technology.

We knew back April, decided businesses making money important saving lives stopping spread locking completely exited entire country's population. Glad individuals arrested. hope book thrown them.

They'll probably remember fondly time lives (hopefully) whole family home together months information still stays even get downvotes. internet points matter. truth always outweight downvotes. countermeasures bring R-value down. take seriously, obey them, try make others obeying too. Sticking head sand stupid.

We brains, virus not. win. kinda believe part though. I'm pretty sure stopped hiring credentials started hiring based merit lack thereof. seeing mass numbers already completely true. Instead handful anecdotal stories actual proof reinfections- relapses scientists actually investigate.

That suggests we're missing something. US fundamentally different cultural symbols, motifs motivations many countries Western Europe. culture based rugged individualism self-reliance.

And know what, really good thing sometimes. Americans pretty tough overall. there’s time place it, time rugged individualism. earth isnt flat. cna literally look sea see curvature. Many people wearing masks china mouths, nose, use one layer masks - must make impact statistics. think two-fold:

-people china likely wear masks, prevents contamination air carriers
-people china likely reduce social activity, prevents contamination air carriers

Notice countries people reduced social activity, wear masks (e.g. Canada), that's enough 'contain' virus. countries people wear masks reduce social activity (e.g. Japan), enough 'contain' virus. countries happens, virus basically stops dead tracks. 

This thing airborne, still needs people propagate it. countries virus contained, people still actively propagating virus: distancing wearing masks. (e.g. US).

Obviously glossing many factors, that's belief based results I'm seeing. Sadly, nothing consumer habits reduce risk. second shutdowns could honestly insane first higher-ups step help. 

I think need happen,but there's got support citizens. taught breath martial arts well. Keeps getting gassed high exertion. mean wrong ok, 10k pnumonoia deaths sounds perfectly reasonable.

Pooh dictator elected officials crumbled demands moronic constituents. Surgical masks likely ad-hoc masks effective stopping someone already infected spreading *droplets*, aerosols penetrate them. need N95 (or better) properly fitted handled order protect thing airborne

That matter debate. ""Airborne"" circumstances? Yes know spreads via droplets, big stay airborne long relatively easy filter. Airborne refers much smaller aerosols, readily remain air penetrate masks. Covid known readily aersolized medical procedures form ventilation (cause early outbreaks washington state, EMTs responded calls elder care facilities using airbags patients breathing difficulties). sure aerosolized generally, question common that. ramifications huge terms necessary precautions one assumes readily spread via aerosols. Genuine question: 4th, much due 4th much ties back protests/riots happened? still president another 6 months. Even running re-election, still 1/8 4 year term left serve, significant amount time. lot happen amount time, like executive orders one. presidents powers aren’t rendered ineffective last 6 months office. 

Meetings foreign leaders also extend past presidency, policy objective discussed president send message forward house senate. leaders don’t talk individual members Congress senate get things done. much slowly able get control fixing diet eliminating gut stress?  Good god... that’s don’t talk much shit even tho could really use break right now. sure I’ll survive boss like easy prove number debate optimistic end. Right estimates .6-3% even 1% estimate somewhat generous. .5% rate, frankly generous would 1.5 million dead US hit 80% population. 800k dead half US get infected .5% death rate. acceptable numbers you? Yup! Disabled person asthma POTS. stay home, order delivery, insist masks people home them. 

 Masks suck poor blood flow bad lungs, hospitalized REALLY sucks. I'll everything avoid getting Covid. 

People ADA cards laminate right asses. Hey man, lots people deserve punched mouth. guy annarogant, hypocritical piece shit. admit voted him, regret it. forget /u/ReallyRickAstley mean witness? camera crew filming thing. ones initially then? mental gymnastics? TLDR: state politicians want stop mandatory mask wearing (in shops such), conference 16 states health ministers (they coordinating) decided still needed. agree. However, disturbing even considered abolish mask mandate (which already applies closed public spaces additional exemptions). Mask wearing works. scientifically proven. Besides okay numbers moment Germany, nothing changed. still know enough virus, still cure, still vaccine. changes, mask mandate imperative. many kids gotten Kawasaki? wish....however keep Disney World would give also? Many Europeans balance dislike Roma desire racist. make easy though. LA, it’s free insurance. walk “walk in” clinic it’s free. Including antibody test. considering past weeks. Since talking increased deaths would like mention 880,000 suicides 2019. year currently 551,000 suicides(1 week mid year). currently 19,000 deaths coronavirus. 

Lockdown killing people too. need balance. Oh, ""let's replace white people"" comes across quite racist. Well least United States country problem Didn’t want get lost deleted comments Karen. Oh hai Mark   I'm sorry, hope alright, alone fear. keep safe best stay away others (if possible) hopefully ease soon. 

But yeah, people need start paying attention, way much complacency. ignoring actual data New York Minneapolis here? take measures hands. Stay 1-2m person. Wash hands, often. sanitizer go out. Cough sneeze inner elbow.

All simple measures everyone take. wear masks, cases start declining. No, said evidence. Absence evidence evidence absence. Agreed, would require poster move parents house experience life beyond college experience, beyond older college students wanna cling college days live college students. people actually move the. like omg actually work way bottom company? mommy daddy told special deserve top begin with! Luckily white privilege live home figuring out.  Yea, Charlie Baker seems like taking cautious sensible approach reopening. Recently hit 0 COVID related deaths, said still take even thinking reopening state. social consequences holding kids back year DEVASTATING. Even casual search literature shows kids largely condemned substandard life. imagine whole generation kids graduate they're 19. kids affected? proceed on? start children education time kids entering system? 19 year old football players 2022-2040 sharing field 14 year olds? 

I think option table either, unfortunately. anti-mask turns anti-vax realize tried harder fix still mask stage.

I mean, dont anti-vax generall fast tracked vaccine, perception safety vaccine much subjective political issue Yeah, lot supervisors managers, job make sure everyone look busy, that’s management :( Lol Korean immigrants? Europe? day day life barely changed. vivid dream died fucking thing believe kind thing, really fuckin sticks afterwards.

So talking I'll deep heart feel like ""well there"". staff.

ADA lists exemption 'direct threat' meaning may compelled offer expemptions direct threat health safety others. kids daycare program one kid autism needs quiet space aid sometimes may reasonable accommodation, taking child autism regular uncontrolled fits hits staff children reasonable accommodation business make. cannot compelled risk safety.

An employer must offer reasonable accommodations also offer employment operating heavy equipment person epilepsy. Maybe equipment operators make 25/hr desk work pays 15/hr refuse transfers higher paying job safe. 

Safety always defense. Unless you’re Russia Saudi Arabia. heard that. link information? easy provide one says 1% affected? 100 million years end, 330million US stock going go assume. probably looking healthcare professionals government types inoculated years end average Joe wont see till sometime next year. woman both. agreed. currently sharing household parents figure fuck happening next months. jeallus people get deal significant others live get decide degree risk comfortable consistently.

as told husband, biggest psychological example societal gaslighting ever. many people acting like covid flu liberal hoax longer issue despite record numbers first two months places took seriously.

He 41, pre-existing conditions. COVID tore him. It’s devastating healthy man’s body. poor family. 

I know wife finally able see him- doubt ever conscious, knows brain damage strokes lack O2 caused. I’m sure ever really got see talk version got sick hospital. It’s devastating. heart broken her.... him. Wealth health :( understand small events like farmer's markets, etc. fair... bad news. surrounding counties even sub-200 cases COVID-19. Gonna suck shoots up. get saying, *would* reasonable shopping accommodation: online shopping, home delivery, curbside pick up, wear masks. Nearly everyone Texas working diabetes lol. fattest cities America Fuck red blue. Let's start revolution. women family lived til 95 generally good health still could another 15 years lay accept fate wear masks, lay down, accept slightly worse fate? Masks social distancing.

Americans won’t admit this, tend think lot like punk rockers culture. lot people see recommendations restrictions say “you can’t tell do”. study done Australian bush fires moving hand away actually protect getting burned, advisable it. one person plane carrier, everyone considered exposed. Lol begins? Christ according little girl allegedly molested. 12 days results!! gf got tested results within 24 hours. joke! Outdoors way safe indoors. Makes sense 10 people. got virus severe asthma didn’t symptoms. It’s getting much weaker evolves Yes, chasing symptoms quite adventure, turned endometriosis, booo

Good luck tummy feel Widow. widow. It’s mixed bag me. There’s stress wondering loved one get sick tomorrow, company planning another round layoffs. hand, don’t miss commuting two hours day. I’m saying steroids shit even though you’ll get big af naturally always better. get tho work hard fuck 20 years vs work hard fuck 2 years steroids lol. Thank you. :) sure holds true times plague?

 mean part wants think superstitions would fade modern times, I'm sure people alive today interpreting Coronavirus ""Punishment God"" I’m sure discussed half Brazil’s test positive. extremely scary opinion. Technically many test US would like 15 million cases. thoughts this? Yeah ""please"" that's working really well headline writer could compete Fauci ""king understatement, 2020"" sash swift ban 

Not empty threat, got power. Yeah might trouble. 

The thing hurricanes never really know. Sometimes LAST minute veer away. 

Sometimes lose strength. 

And sometimes leave stranded surrounded water power couple weeks.

I'm betting Delphine bathwater grift face-off.  That’s crazy we’re sending folks elsewhere. wonder risks increasing virus spread person transport. Close borders enforce two-week quarantine anyone coming oversees. closed borders China country, makes sense. That's March - picture Mexico different point.  Yeah, “help” drones.

 work mall, every day see less masks. fucked super easy, barely inconvenience Thanks hate it. Yup, mention USA economy. Nope, I’m point I’m curious see I’ll look like year getting haircut According Cuomo today one received approval state reopen. probably happened approved reopening plan. today made clear said whether schools reopen fall. asked every single school district, 700ish, submit reopening plan middle month. important numbers, usually lag testing significantly. Ivanka crestfallen! tried find mention “outdoors working” effective (except NYT paywall) didn’t find anything. direct says that? wait till November It’s literally fucking question. people actually use brains going questions. maybe Canadians pumping growth hormone antibiotics cows. know aren't, would make better milk. Although, hair eyes made laugh...I see 😄  good die young Oh worry, four siblings procreating enough make it, they're like Ontario 0 Covid deaths 0 new ICU admissions past 24 hours. We're populated province Canada, Toronto 4th largest city North America population. Ontario US state, would fifth largest population New York, Florida, Texas, California. migration efforts work us, work elsewhere. wait till see prizes! That's freaking amazing! long I'll retain (along american) another story 😂😂 thank god google cell phones guess, wish I'd learned metric system school rather buying drugs 😂 guess disagree viewed ""proper approach civilized society."" opinion, political violence completely justifiable case. Yay JT! Canadian, I'm extremely happy turned down. basically nothing gain going since agreement already signed; lot lose even looked like marginally getting along Trump. Good stuff. 

It's proud day Canada, therefore world. Antibody Factory new black. Covid low death rate. Calm It’s extremely individualistic culture sure. Also, rules place aren’t really enforced. States left thing. population, simply wouldn’t put nearly many rules Europeans did. People will. not. comply. Antibodies lasting doesn’t mean you’re immune retain memory memory B cells
to rapidly re-expand upon second challenge. try harder would bet somewhere. national one, try local city one. access it? Maybe try said ""Germans follow rules recommendations"" . Everyone knows Germans love Americans eat McDonalds Mask 100% safe, reduces risk. safer stay away 'murica. travel remove mine one responding to, political opposite opinion? According logic 0% winning lottery 40% chance winning lottery you’re still deciding play it’s guaranteed? Lol people stupid everyone helped vaccinated long ago post report button avoid politics mods don’t enforce it? I'm finding hard believe. Running, sleeping back, cleaning dusty area, even simple cold flu makes feel like cotton balls lungs breath through. also smaller lung capacity, yeah, I'm good. “No, I’m good.” Agreed. scary variable Utah, California Nevada getting slammed well, New Mexico rising it’s dire, hospitals Colorado far away isn’t metro anywhere near Arizona, closest would Pueblo isn’t close NM border

So they’re going send patients another state I’d imagine best option New Mexico. Colorado could also probably take time getting isn’t big issue got dumber reading comment. god hurts. Yeah, Tom Hanks random dude brainstorming. mind? No. think ""liberal"" means ""extreme left wing"" know parties actually represent. Trudeau experienced coronavirus firsthand. wonder risk it. Assuming 10 cases every 1 confirmed statistic valid, kind crazy would mean we're approaching 10% population? want kids back school gonna stay inside then

edit: also summer No. Sure fact remains carcinogen market years due cover extreme ignorance manufacturer, discovered inadvertently independent testing agency. inspire confidence system. Maybe also good reading: Yikes. I'm sorry
I hope guys turn around. Trump It’s proven iffy correlation cotton masks prevent COVID transmission. proven medical grade masks prevent transmission numerous credible studies. I'm also NY, upstate. We're getting cases restaurants reopened people coming back travel. work place reopened curbside stuff. really feel safe tbh. Unless newly stationed low infection area low risk poorly enough surprised people start push conspiracy theory certain government officials failing purpose effort clear bunch people collecting Social Security. Proof country president fucking retarded. Kill myself. Yeah, that's perfect spot area. plus side, upstate recently entered phase 4. Ommegang open outdoor stuff according website. Albany area, Saratoga real fancy decent amount stuff open too. No, U’s eyes W nose. Lol, supposed used cute, funny, happy.  Hug, supposed hug death. I'm pretty sure Snopes servers handle capacity reddit clicks. That's rinky dink operation. Amazing photo that! Hmmm dunno would even say murderer doesn’t deserve killed covid... it’s part judicial system, prisons still duty care! Mexico, one employee entrance retail shops malls taking temperature refusing entrance people w/o mask. inside way reinforce tho. Okay, we're reddit. visibility comment reddit receive people browsing reddit.

There's reason (well, least ideal, something many people consciously practice). notice one posts downvoted apparent legitimate reason I'll often edit note asking people downvote comment disasgree it, link reddiquette FAQ. I'm pretty sure makes _more_ likely I'll downvoted people assume I'm mostly concerned internet points, pretty ironic.

Bad voting results fewer interesting valuable discussions helps spread disinformation. Also, even internet points meaningless, discourages participation response person receives comment snap downvote (or several downvotes). did, would especially nonsensical Spanish Flu begin Spain.

From Wikipedia: ""The first observations illness mortality documented United States (in Fort Riley, Haskell County, Kansas well New York City), France (Brest), Germany United Kingdom. maintain morale, World War censors minimized early reports. Newspapers free report epidemic's effects neutral Spain, grave illness King Alfonso XIII, stories created false impression Spain especially hard hit."" Yea last sentence sums up. turning invitation better job photo would imo talking about? Lol right?! Na, leftly passed Probably also Trump world’s joke. Seems working perfectly fine us. nation, seem avoided almost negative effects Trump presidency. Poor India. virus going destabilise world much. Honestly, that's start looking doping steroid use culture.

There's likely common thread somewhere it’s TexASS agree. And, think Joe Biden way savior, isn’t elected large uncontested majority November completely fucked. husband eligible Italian citizenship working case. US withstand another 4 years trump. Toronto (in Ontario) would third largest city NY LA. (or essentially tied Chicago depending measured)  Listening experts experts every Nordic country wants government questionable? Ok, Maobot Switzerland also went wih fewer masks cleaning hands ans cases rising again.

I guess safe miss masks atm. I've got wind, doubt divine. probably mistake assume people willing oppose basic public health measures would make kind rational bargain here. companies promising benefits free travel tickets, housing food draw workers urban areas, others managing hiring new faces nearby locations. trying mix both.

Wild exploited abused workers suddenly recognized essential business owners executives. far exceeded expectations. bar pretty low one would surprised followed Trump actually listened experts sand scientists let lead. done good job Ford crisis. think helped Canada Ontario Trudeau's wife Ford's mother law got Covid early on. Nice dude. Wish best cleaning mess. I’m glad got smart folks like top this. He, rightly, wants distance Trump administrations dumb reckless publicity stunt.

He also probably wants distance coronvirus. Would terribly bad look someone team brought virus back them. sad see Quebec 3 times number deaths per capita. can't force people get help.

Why not? used time. Source reporting Palm Beach? Plot twist, Trump never leaves office Either way, thanks chat spot chap. nice meeting you, internet houses strange ones refreshing encounter person manners kindness. 1039? Fuck dad necessarily trash, link appears poorly written (in scientific sense) interpretation foreign national. Pieces conclusions useful. wear face shield mask. 

Now someone severe limited communication skills etc, different story. sounds high func really apply Unfortunately bodies streets people think big deal let run rampant. see bad side gets control late, incredibly sad..but Murica I'm sure company would argue increasing likelihood global society returns ""normal"" quickly, shareholder's best financial interests. said I’m fine Business/mayor/governor orders it. 
Federal government legally.

Emotions aren’t factor here, law. ""Then get non-union Mexican equivalent."" public health it’s I’m making career. Wear mask. need safe according studies even close quarter contact. No, people saying deaths low states haven’t reported data. RI, Connecticut Kentucky wouldn’t swing numbers one way other, fact deaths low weekend.  China knew long term health effects since least February doubt kid college freshman fall. 
 
There’s many half-baked plans university. It’s one thing another, piling up.
 
Ex. comes home Thanksgiving, self-quarantine 2 weeks. Break 5 days. Unless widely available, rapid result, test kit made ... idea her.
 
Ex. Someone dorm floor tests positive. what?
 
All staggered move-in date promises modified environment meet distancing rules. That’s simply good enough. **And death toll virus keeps going down.....** Yep. wife professor smaller state school. commuter school traditional big college campus.  far refused mandate masks leaving professor. still requiring classes held person. hoping something changes next month. enforcing mandate?

Our ""mandate"" VA fucking joke. Hmmmmm thanks! think started producing en masse UK government funding parallel trials carried out. think said million doses ready month 30m ready August time, can't find read that, months ago. stuff made preferentially UK partnership AZ, know rest world in-person question period important tool get media attention, without Trudeau dominated coverage people gonna bad time too. see lots jobs realizing either

1. didn’t actually need people, resulting job waiting get back.
2. Businesses realizing pay someone India half price work home. Resulting lots job cuts over.

Lots people bad time blows over. tolerate mask face, also would tolerate wearing face shield likely. way simplify real problem families guess people learn firsthand. Oddly enough, many also believe (by word, rather action) higher power less verifiable evidence. least one family member mine come revere nation's current leader almost genius messiah figure. He'll take word scientist's / doctor's second thought, proceed construct attribute elaborate reasoning behind actions. 

You can't fight remote facts, needs first-hand eye eye. POTUS ignoring things extending visit invitations?


It doesn’t. feels like Trump trying make covid worse US, suppress voters stay power long possible. already forgot government leader Merkel infected, too. quarantined two weeks all. reason keep secret, great role model that's people take pandemic quite seriously here. Wait what? Another shitty ruling? deaths/day approaching zero. Seems okay. Could country falling apart anything possibly get help. Nowhere claim science absolute truth. Calling wearing mask “virtue signaling” propaganda tactic discredit people following scientific advice. See Texas, Florida, et. al. successful wearing masks doors works empirically. Taking measures hands nothing country whole. Especially since many people go work grocery store can't control actions others. Washing hands nothing remove virus air respiratory stream maskless woman behind grocery store. That’s pretty accurate. Hopefully experts trying figure make reality. 

I think community outreach goes along way Basically without entire country would dictated New York, California Illinois regardless rest country thought. It’s reason. want get rid fine, need divide main US landmass 50 equal parts otherwise would absolutely fucked know reason NY got control extreme lockdown country right? surprise all. Reminds vape clouds drifting near full city block behind people. Congratulations United States achieving shithole status. Seems like you’re hating bro obviously despicable, least theyre ALSO demanding students &amp; instructors put safety line order attend school they're committed attending &amp; working at. university basically forced in-person instructing. show up, someone lower ""chain"" expected instruct in-person place--an undergrad TA contingent lecturer. first year students still housed dorms like everything business usual. Duh! race ended! /s apple? No, work. already confirmed Pfizer vaccine causes immune response like coronavirus does. fact better immune response coronavirus itself.

That means vaccine work. End discussion. issue ""Does work without horrible negative side effects?""

That reason rolling vaccine right now.   Herd immunity US without vaccine would require least another 195 million people infected, antibodies don’t appear permanent. It’s terrible fucking plan. one might think lawsuit settled without admission guilt bad wearing blackface multiple occasions hey, whatever  Yes.

We'll basically wait see, Fauci considering reasonable expectation seasonality I'm inclined believe that. Misposted reply Ahh 2020 version russian roulette Go Ireland worry big shoots, I've seen lot worse this. tip iceberg.

If want treat mentally ill people way treat people, flipping middle Target wrong, I'm gonna talk shit you.

So it? pity treat different put pedestal? treat like Karen freaking public? Yes surprise all. open state well. kids old enough yet used teach really summer daycare. fun things home summer kids stay home them. countries wearing masks, hard say 1.5M specifically.

 Also, we've several super-spreader events would indicate much larger radius 1.5m. would official account.

May outdated. case case basis.

But wonder knew back many would lasting effects... Sounds like zoo pretty serious public health. three states don’t make significant impact data either way.

No, deaths uptrend. check 7 day moving average Worldometer see trend continues downward. 254 251 two days uptrend. graph deaths check 7 day moving average. Also, point, individual response varied. know someone close infected Feb still strong antibody response last week. wage slave, know choice. No, think whenever loosen restrictions first cases go up, question whether testing contact tracing good enough bring back down. people won’t change year. Look smoking, took long long time decrease. need look behavior change long term game doesn’t end vaccine comes out. needs real effort interact communities deny medical expertise work create small changes lasting effects. Lots girls work easier jobs like servers, entertainers, activity leaders coordinators. experience, girls loose shit. probably hooked 9-10 cruise workers worked cruise. remember one girl hooked got tattoo guy shagged. 55 time got me. wrapped sure!

LOL kidding.

 


It's going bad God hope something soon. needed treatment UK, would likely taken specialist Covid-19 hospital paid nothing extra. depends insured well state/municipality in. cities/towns offering free testing. anxiety-provoking *not* wearing face mask... also numerous states even reporting results. 

Yesterday (July 5) 42.5k new positives 654k new tests without 6 states submitting test data, according Covid Tracking Project. seem think positive test makes contagious, rather infected virus. 

They even think that. failure intelligence. outright purposeful treatment humans cogs machine. Keep going wear out. serious actions would obviously result slowing machine unacceptable machines. example extreme overprecaution. extreme opposite would turning away anyone whose already die. Obviously, reality would somewhere middle.

I'm wondering room start discharging mile patients needs happen. rushing testing phase all, even little bit. rushing delay testing manufacturing. 

Usually wait tests a-okay starting manufacture vaccine use, takes time ramp manufacturing (ordering machines, setting production sites, hiring people, training people, marketing). time, already manufacturing vaccine HUGE numbers testing going time. soon tests finish results good, use millions doses pre-manufactured. horrible human never knew flu asymptomatic year.. feel like that's common knowledge all. I've never wonder that's why. :/ exactly false comparisons? beach different protest, fact would say it’s safer. protest it’s big crowd, people screaming shouting. virus can’t tell difference protest beach even news tells can. get it’s first amendment right that’s case, don’t wear mask anywhere it’s within right choose goes body. People often know things people know... FYI. I’m enjoying lockdown. Here's why.

(1) Get spend loads times wife, kids, dog.

(2) neither wife waste time commuting.

(3) fortunate live great circumstance—a large house work relax here, fair amount open space taking walks bike rides safely, neighborhood pools, tennis courts, dog park, home gym, good weather, etc.

(4) don’t go many boring meetings. meetings held zoom, tune out, multi-task, read, etc.

(5) need travel, whether across town across country.

This virus fucker me. I'm mid twenties.

I diarrhea, lost appetite, sense taste, head ached, entire body ached days end, waked every day mild fever.

It quite bad ride. hope people understand flu. get complications many like actor Officials states surging coronavirus cases issued dire warnings blamed outbreaks early reopenings Sunday seven-day average daily new cases United States reached **record high 27th straight day.**

From linked article. saying ain’t so? fair, filled illiterates base votes party give free laptops, fans, TVs Biryani (a spicy dish popular South India least). epitome misinformation like ever since independence guess. Much, much worse we've told. contracted COVID back MARCH.

As someone else caught late Feb/early March, I'm fucking terrified anew. Granted, case much severe, I've experiencing issues might small blood clots time time, too, fucking JULY now.

I really, REALLY think people taking shit seriously enough. scares me, too. Yes. personally I’ve developed bronchitis end cold I’ve past years. Surprisingly didn’t bronchitis getting flu winter. post-viral cough lasted long time.  2009 H1N1 pandemic flu first discovered Mexico. 

In opinion, whether pandemic form virus first started China USA, stop lot blame going China, evidence outbreak Late November/Early December, failed fully accountable destroying virus samples, suppressing information angry countries implemented travel restrictions early. 

Lastly, even China final confirm original place virus first started. still valid reasons express racists sentiment culture, long industries occupations human animals interact, threat next zonotic disease always there, need prepare it.

well, *kinda* similar, we're unique corruptability

seeing entire nation founded compromise sect ended fighting death all

Shame you. thing t-cell hope antibody tests done people confirmed cases validation almost always come positive good test, even asymptomatic. don’t understand means could additional large population tests negative antibodies, already virus immune. Also know antibody surveys well 1% US indeed immune, likely still less 10%. common symptoms. lot folks worst flu *their* lives (of many every year) think got experienced extremely common symptoms rewrite narrative pandemic happens. far bigger number folks outside China really end 2019.

It less intense mild cold. Christ, charging 90k year? \^ This! article describes 3000 deaths “probable” deaths reported based symptoms. I’m skeptical two reasons:

1. It’s flu season Chile.

2. Chile found nearly 300,000 cases highest per capita case total world consider countries least 3 million citizens. would many people severely ill enough die never tested seems unlikely.

Lol. hahahahahahaha piece add new cdc guidelines review covid deaths actually delay death numbers week occured. Good chance adds well, plus fact started younger crowd. I'm still holding breath far happily surprised deaths seemingly going . Ah yes, much better country dictated minority, regardless *the majority* country thinks.  yet strange reason far virus spreading society Europe. mean, sure, counties refusing follow order, milquetoast shutdowns. today, thousands Orange County residents who, high probability social distancing last weekend, went back work recycled air offices. people going infect hell other.  what? no. makes say that? I've house three times groceries past month so. know getting impression. last week covid-19 patients went occupying 35% occupied ICU beds 36% ICU beds normal circumstances 45% occupied ICU beds 44% ICU beds. Hospitalized positive patients 1600 2200 week. Surges delay inevitable two major studies mask usage SARS-epidemic don’t provide enough scientific proof effect, according Scandinavian health departments. 

Also mandatory use masks would collide strategy principle stay home feeling symptoms follow social distansation. Encouragement mask usage would send signals it’s “okay” quick run store even feeling symptoms. It’s “ok” close people etc. Social distancing safe. 

In theory masks harm good. example person COVID-19 positive puts mask touches virus sticks hands easily transmitted. It’s hard touch mask gonna wear day. Even medical staff education struggling. 

Sorry bad English:) Take look yourself. Know testing US able around 50,000-70,000 per day.

Don’t take believe lies. positive cases Mack g around 70,000 per day. indicates far cases able test for. Melanie Billions. got hit harder, faster earlier locked harder Cali. Also Cali huge state. lot country locked people moving slowly, virus slower enter populated parts Cali.

There reason Massachusetts 1.8% 7 day rolling average positivity rate kids back school. Sure. AZ Texas might not. But, AZ almost 2500 miles apart. Europe would akin saying schools UK closed virus still raging Moscow...oh, wait saying schools UK open positivity rate 7 day average 1%. much worse part underage sex ring private island protests take time setup mask distribution station, sanatization, held outside... Trump rallies crowds many people side side arena. Yes, think likely gullible trump followers far likely spread virus. Great excuse. ""Sorry can't make it, pandemic!"" mean perfect way get party ! smoking medicinal, playing video games, baking muffins, cooking good meals, watched Wire among many great shows--yeah, pretty great.  could years. US 9th highest deaths per million 183 countries reporting COVID deaths. say lowest deaths per capita pretty far right.

Edit: actually read Trump's tweet posted this. assumed OP correct saying Trump said lowest per capita deaths world, that's actually said. said lowest mortality rate world, different stat.

Luckily, even though stat automatically populated linked information, information get number. need divide number deaths total cases multiply 100,000 get death rate per 100,000 cases.

The death rate positive cases 4,400 deaths per 100,000 cases US. right middle pack countries slightly lower worldwide average 4,616 deaths per 100,000 cases.

If widdle 20 countries cases, US comes 9th 20 (just coincidence rank per capita cases). France, UK, Italy, Mexico, Spain, Canada, Iran, Germany higher mortality rate Brazil, Peru, Colombia, India, Turkey, Chile, Pakistan, South Africa, Russia, Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia lower mortality rate US.

It also noted US far far higher number recent cases European countries, means mortality rate likely climb within next weeks.

Either way, think Trump's claim among lowest mortality rate supported fact. Thanks man, took lot. basically throw life away start fresh. Totally worth though. I’m sorry people. think helped immunity boost shots got Whole Foods. like $4 tiny shot. Immunity boosters. chest physical therapy time myself. felt like person sitting chest horrible fever pain. knew something quarantined myself. working masters nursing infectious disease followed WHO. knew something up. whats that? weekend trip cottage? social media needs block him. shit old. old 4 years. get supporters stand somewhere 1800's. fact supporters testament stupidity America. reasons. First, one said virus attaches “mucous membranes”- said attaches ACE-2 receptors prevalent nose ears. Ear plugs needed. Second, (cloth, non medical) masks prescribed keep droplets yourself, meaning exhale talk cough, preventing spreading others. It’s known cloth masks best prevention protect inhaling what’s floating there. Third, seen healthcare workers wearing face shields? used reasons would use goggles, people recommend eye protection you’re likely close contact Covid positive people could exhaling, talking coughing near eyes. way virus getting eyes touching surface sticking finger eyes. That’s everyone telling wash hands, use hand sanitizer, stop touching face- advice easier follow telling everyone wear goggles time. Im UK. This... sounds like designed corruption.

The people wearing masks wearing nose, setting picking up, touching repeatedly dirty hands. saw guy yesterday mask covered dirt dont see could breathe.

And remeber, lockdown fauci said 4 MILLION people would dead now.

Lol live US. live next hot zone first reported cases were. whole town (500) got sick (first store clerks, whole town) December March. deaths, either reported hearsay. 

Bottom line me, someone wants good people arguing focused non sense. Let's wake don""t we. many lost out-of-control virus. even close. lol

But,

If leadership proclaims victory virus hadnt even reached state yet, takes piss people states problems solved eventually ridicules lockdown/mask regulations, kinda wish huge surge upon make eat words. Check yourself, it’s 91 degrees Miami. region organized special cars administer tests - think later whole country started using approach. Maybe could suggest governor? arrive swabs full PPE call door take test. also acknowledging fecal-oral transmission vector flushing aerosolizes virus. means even 6 feet away, using bathrooms dozens/hundreds others like campus bathrooms well within 6ft range airborne particulate every time use bathroom.

Also, there's AC blowing building particulate ain't hanging nearby person that's spreading - shits blowing every direction them. can’t effectove tracking test results far - I’ve waiting nine days still results. Tested 3 days symptoms. started tracking contacts tomorrow, would two weeks behind exposure. syphilis balances out, somehow. That's workers good access paid leave, stay home even mild symptoms. Also, good routines access protective equipment masks face shields would decrease asymptomatic spread lot. vast majority ones charge delivery fee. US simply spread delivery make sense. also uses “virtue signaling” pretty obvious right-wing term use excuse they’re racist. 

“Oh you’re white Liberal supporter violence minorities? Nice virtue-signaling!” kind happened pretty fast people prepped think. Maybe situation start sink catering service appears also badly under-prepared, hope improves given compensation. Ummm........we kind figured one Canada six months ago. Herd immunity take years even current rate. top new research coming showing antibodies last nearly long enough sustain herd immunity. It’s unethical it’s nearly impossible. I'm sure better this, safer, I'm believing quite safe enough terms positive test. interior space, air becomes mix everyone's breath---how else done nothing grocery shop ended positive. rigorously everyone comes close tested covid.  pretends care free forces others careless, probably freaked average person team people trying prevent getting it. Sweden can't access online library? 

I think Germans care, won't. Germans caring Right Way Things generally would guess would. November 4 months away. loses election, becomes lame duck get anything done last two months. assume he'll go world tour / business networking Russia, China, Saudi Arabia. think Trump really clearly defined policy objectives beyond pandering keep office expect anything presidency carry next. Trump centrist work undone least give appearance moving country centrist stance.

You're right executive orders. That's think strategy using covid excuse engage see Trump smoothly retirement Trudeau's intent. like Canada number 1 Trump's list right issues agreements rise PM/Presidential level right let issues inertia behind play avoid starting anything new. Yes, thank this. Mental health professionals vary training! worked residential treatment facility adolescents behavioral problems yes, deal situations like glasses/rocks/whatever thrown you, patients picking fights, kid stabbing another kid pencil getting drink drinking fountain...

..at time, direct care professionals trained restraints safely (and different adolescents weight), supposed absolutely necessary actual response ""Call security handle it."" Even counselors saw clients appointment, offices, much less training/expectation realm restraints. think moving towards getting rid restraints period rely police escalating situations, years know protocol now.

Even world relying mental health professionals de-escalating situations, would still 'how safely restraints, possibly take weapons away, prevent people hurt' counterpart job. received training restraints DCP - ZERO training grad school around that. kind de-escalation talking even kind situation specialized, standard curiculum mental health counseling/counseling psychology. actually wouldn’t surprised speak Trump often. Jesus Christ. going openly racist? even UK better United States. mean can't even get sports back yet 😭 reputation germaphobe. might easier get sensible private playing fears. shitty human matter position deserves punch mouth. saying politics exempt accountability shitty? Ok emo. usually take shit going whole day avoid issue. it'd real edge case.

Anyway beach even go public shitter, go swim ocean wash hands.  wonder people react vaccine made readily available...  need fired. Quit bothering people want wear mask Jagmeet Singh? Alberta throwing fit Harper used suck dicks dirty oil Trudeau doesn't. 

Also history said oil. Alberta made lot money gave away instead investing social services like Québec did. 😭 like care better argumentation this. guess thats last resort someone doesnt know countries talking bout. contact tracing US joke must already gotten mild case careful *only* doctor says unfit work. want clog healthcare system mildly sick people need nothing sick note.  Jesus. It’s clear Johnson ready today scapegoat folks order avoid taking responsibility. 

The US U.K. drastically dropped ball here, starts leadership response virus. specific type therapy professionally I've never trouble getting job, there's simply enough professionals even make mental/behavioral healthcare system less fragmented. extra tragic much personal preference plays role treatment, someone doesnt get along therapist psychiatrist 30 mile radius, slow make treatment impossible. 

So General Practioners trying hardest fill gaps without experience knowledge base needed provide good psychiatric care. end teenagers prescribed psychotropics date modern practice ineffective straight counterindicative therapy supplement treatment. client months ago 140 pounds prescribed enough Ativan knock NFL lineman. still hallucinating, high worry it.


By comparison NIH system flaws atleast provide cohesive care people chronic mental illness.


Atleast COVID crisis proven telepsychiatry teletherapy effective safe alternatives. that's silver lining. said facetious sarcastic. covid=flu trope still used despite evidence covid much serious flu. expect information show flu causes severe rare complication rate similar covid flippant. don’t know say yet. I’ve yet see good data people Lupus autoimmune disorders affected, it’s possible since people Lupus weaker immune systems they’d less susceptible cytokine storm. signaling” 

As yes - cry right-wing whenever someone left leaning something try improve relations minorities.

You’re sort fucked you’re white guy running country. say “we stand blacks!” you’re virtues signaling. don’t take stand keep quiet “why don’t stand us say something”

Can’t win. He’s honestly probably getting antibodies pumped daily. He’s getting top treatment, demanding aren’t get back work. People stupid entitled. put way too, point every state keeps mask basic constraints mass gathering reach point within 1-2 months.

Which say, NY, NJ late implementing lock down, CA, AZ, etc early ;-( (maybe not, gave time ramp testing and, hopefully, prepare). much difference policy, rather (somewhat) accidental different timing.

PS. course eradication (SK/NZ style) would better outcome, clearly unreachable US Ah yes, state officials rushed reopen blame rush reopen Corona spread...not said rushing. 

What hell accountability? know closed place good, right? talking think tourism change future, yet treating countries question would still amount infected right now. places in, say Sweden, run small risk exposed virus. surprising tourists found miniscule risk one worth taking hope Uni paying attention headlines... I'm scared going back fall. w/ dem's refusal set mail voting, pressure Bernie drop prematurely

He getting ass kicked chance He's one US's popular politicians, despite corporate media DNC's constant smearing undermining.

Someone popular people might support president. 

The DNC really far less power think. can’t flip millions put much faith suppressed rigged voting results, 

But keep conspiracy theories excuses. Thankfully one Bernie types never win primary don’t honestly audit came short look improve.

Bernie got destroyed black vote again. FOUR YEARS one likes Biden

Evidently 11 million democratic voters I'll voting Green, alongside vote all.

And Donald Trump thanks voting green. listen Bernie he’s voting for? Terrible, hope science figure come healthy people get bad don’t test, don’t cases. don’t meters, don’t spread. It’s quick maths. tell Bill Gates do. Comical lol went back neverland like fictional things Heparin clotting tendency?

If pacemaker answer according doctor, ! hope history repeats itself. Case numbers US rising death numbers still falling several weeks now. Nate silver talks lot. Deaths simply patting two weeks. One plausible theory young people getting sick dying. Yeah seems luck buddy, least tell happy cake day. person trying tell based rules subreddit, comment likely removed stance promoting political violence. 

You realize verbalizing desire act violence politician world leader -- OK comes part hopefully tie threads together -- openly stated desire political violence high profile political figure public forum.

As stating wish something violent would happen politician, voicing encouragement political violence. sure: can't keep salvage, that's myth. also cannot salvage something owner want to. however ignore rudder ships happen let slowly drift nearest cliff. right call is:

NOT PROBLEM!  Toronto surrounding cities (Mississauga, Vaughan, Brampton, Markham etc) making masks mandatory week  secret Denmark? Masks gyms feel good regulation anyway. going saturate mask fast working out, point might well wear it. sounds like give blow jobs. yells penis ejaculates. can't offer DIY, share experience cloth masks.

Sadly wont really find many masks fit like N95. I've best luck slikhound masks find closest N95 far coverage, want look else look basket style vs accordion style mask. get mask enough coverage glasses still fogging consider pulling mask tiny bit upwards setting glasses mask (this helped me)  Often young athletes die suddenly heart problem, turns caused undiagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. least one hot countries Asia (Thailand?) banned use AC that. afraid stores area start using AC gets hot. :( Americans Covid-19 [**the promiscuous**] AIDS.


FTFY know, right? seriously thought he'd contracting months ago.... Colleges schools reopening... cases like 40,000-50,000 cases daily America yet deaths America 500 day so? expect deaths eventually re-reach 1,000-10,000 deaths-per-day rate again? honestly care much incident particular. think astounding posting gofundme medical expenses even reality first world country. man needed pay right die. care rich poor was. right. Hard take out. far worst year life, hope gets better here.

Same. I've learned time hope something guaranteed never happen, can't even hope it'll get better anymore. mean, surely testers take weekends global pandemic, right?

Glad see many people missed tone line. stick head spike bring trial, wanna see discovery. greater proportion immune individuals community, smaller probability non-immune individuals come contact infectious individual, helping shield non-immune individuals infection.

You really learn read, light switch. Herd immunity increases time people gain immunity. state power something mean federal government can. example, state banned masks reason, national mask mandate would violate state's right ban masks.

In additional, generally regulations passed Congress, can't unilaterally decreed President. executive branch, theory, supposed enforce regulations Congress passes, power pass regulations. Huh? States still report weekends, number lower. happens every weekend. reporting issue. think right........ tracers New York told ask, Minneapolis asked 4 testing stations, protests.

Irrelevant, large spike NYC Minneapolis despite testing far extensive NY ever before.

If protests spike cases, NYC, DC, Minneapolis ones leading surge. Instead seeing big surges places big protests lead way opening up. another data point Spain antibody Population - 47 million

Percent anti-bodies - 5% (2,350,000)

Cases - 297,625

Ratio Actual Cases Tested Cases - 7.9 1

IFR = 1.2% 

So 8 1 probably safe ratio right now.... dream situation ngl. I'm quite happy. IMPOTUS president January 20th, 2021.

That’s 6.5 months shit deal with. Definitely! Sunlight certainly also part, humidity also help droplets fall air quickly. think main point 1.5 meters indoors equal “safe “ Sure, great things do. I’ve 4 months. 

Washing hands like crazy. Hand sanitizer like crazy. Washing groceries months fully disinfecting kitchen car. 

I’ve vigilant hell didn’t stop Florida blowing become become. 

No one cares I’m doing. don’t want people coming behind grocery store coughing without mask. That’s want. don’t even GO anywhere else. really many people right things. 

We're embarrassed people act like legitimately concerned future country. Christ, bunch babies. mean Spanish Flu pandemic 1917?? ^(/s) I’m sure you’re trying prove here. Sweden high death rate. data yougov per capita current cases, I’d interested see it. US, masks essential coronavirus response along social distancing. could Sweden Denmark better contact tracing, complying social distancing ways, environmental factor play. situation US night day, many refuse social distance, wear mask, comply contact tracing efforts exist. argument correlation mask usage case rates, science support argument. He’s cockroach. commenting comment isn’t immediately comment.

Really tough see story.  countries reporting deaths differently? reporting positive cases differently? 

From understanding, san Antonio Bexar County first spikes positive cases seen. affecting younger population far good thing procedures place mitigate spread vulnerable populations? positive cases eventually going spread vulnerable populations disease. 

Calculating deaths county's total population worthless stat unless whole county positive. ...of confirmed cases. French trouble-makers protests put American rioters shame. FIFA celebrations circa 2018 people make blockades, smashed ongoing vehicles, personally witnessed reporter pushed still going vespa assaulted, grand finals celebration. Stinkmeanermeaner call Revelers. even know means president's health info usually never released public.

Example: Eisenhower heart attack office, Woodrow Wilson stroke office. found years later.

Edit add: probably right plasma. That's probably he's done whole situation, too. 2020 gunna wait long can, make reason vaccine costs 1000 dollars provided insurance watch. masks, distancing, shaking hands. reopened tourism. First planes people country already landed. need money, they'll lie interesting. things say that, know, they're nice, I'll shut up. sort consistent care medicaid/medicare.

I believe pretty decent insurance, holy hell hard find decent care, much less consistent. Especially living rural town, half hour bigger city. get topic, told could six months someone could see me, hour away, promise insurance would cover it. Anyone closer/sooner taking new clients retiring soon. Keep mind depressed, told suicidal ideation, something really put six months. Thankfully get worse, soul crushing trying actively get help told that. hoping die get arrested soon leaves office. Don’t wear masks big one. beginning CDC told us didn’t need masks. Later came made bullshit supposedly prevent hoarding. came biggest hoarder fucking white house. 

People don’t trust government. frustrating working healthcare, isolating since March, following rules, get many people aren’t. would believe time CDC says actually true? chances infected 10m? Sure may happen likely? Probably not. tragic even Shakespeare written it. Yep, dedicated P100 respirator changing browners. probably taking nudes Melania, they'll text Trudeau later today. Enjoy living authoritarian future type attitude. Canada came close install literal American citizen leader (Scheer), last minute NDP vote switch, NDP leaders support, Canada retained independence.

So dont count Canada safe ex ""friends"" bitched bf wanting go everything reopened wanting hang week later, bar went 5 bars/clubs within 25 feet reported staff diagnosed coronavirus. stopped friends also wear masks club, saw pictures Instagram. 10+ people group went couple times masks. Smh they're blaming young people. bf 24 turn 24 end month we've inside entire time. give examples Russian Chinese propaganda? 4 N95 masks wife I. unused. better using masks, cycling virus might die uses? continue using reusable cloth mask?

Should close respirator valve somehow order prevent unfiltered air escape breath out? started going Dr appointments friends fun. last place needs be. Literally bottom comment unless they've made things strict, thats used be. really used got go front ride, even thats anymore. one point things like broken limbs getting transport provided park, show kind proof, wanted use certain amenities. Otherwise yes they're allowed. media see indoors unless leaked ...  decider chief. accept input anyone, bother. wouldn’t “unsubstantiated” described accurately. BS. part Q narrative. Unrelated ass. specifically florida pretty much every hospital purposely downstaff save money. Antibody tests show infection rates peaking 25% NYC 15% areas. Michigan likely closer 15% well. way, way herd immunity levels.

I'm aware numbers. also think that, common treatment herd immunity bit simplistic. Typically goes like this: R0=4 (somewhat high end), herd immunity got 80%. that's based R0 uncontrolled spread!

 Guess happens 80% population wearing masks? R0 drops. happens 50% practice good social distancing? R0 drops. Etc, theory current level compliance US, herd immunity seemed reached somewhere 10-20% infection rate.. Europe around 5%. 

Also, naive herd immunity estimate make major simplifying assumption uniform population. Taking population non-uniformity (different mobility or, perhaps, different susceptibility disease) tend drop required level herd immunity. See e.g. look worldometers numbers: US states covid19 declining ones infection rates (based death numbers IFR 1%). Similarly, Europe infection numbers 5% (with major exception Germany) I’ll take seriously I’m told doctor I’m going die, else I’m living short life fear, I’m going enjoy Belgian cyclist Niels De Vriendt died age 20. amateur, rode VDM-Van Durm-Michiels-Trawobo CT team, taking part practice race ahead season restart collapsed.

De Vriendt racing Wortegem-Petegem time, quickly received medical attention falling ill, including 40 minutes resuscitation efforts, passed away. cause De Vriendt's death attributed heart failure, according team.

The race first one take place Belgium since COVID-19 pandemic shut cycling season across Europe organised mother Alpecin-Fenix rider Tim Merlier. get shot January die something different March, died something different March. else possible properly categorize stuff? 

The main cause death born. highest Monday result far. numbers trending up.  Lol looks like people agree you. it'll change mind found funny. Agreed, every single one mayors governors keep flouting best practices advice scientists, virologists, epidemiologists need get ass front lines “reopening plans”. want mayor slinging chicken Popeye’s. want governor checking groceries Kroger. want city councilman fetching ice chips graham crackers changing beds cleaning blood pressure cuffs ER. need think HARD harm decisions have. least go doctor's appts. like people become used rat race finally getting chance pause realizing work toiling profit others. quote Marcus Aurelius, 

""So born feel “nice”? Instead things experiencing them? Don’t see plants, birds, ants spiders bees going individual tasks, putting world order, best can? you’re willing job human being? aren’t running nature demands?

You don’t love enough. you’d love nature too, demands you."" Pretty sure Canadians least thankful competent leader right now. Keanu reeves tops every celebrity genuinely nice department. Wasn’t Tom hanks one upset celebrities said they’d leave country trump elected never left? COVID-19 known affect lungs, assholes. 

Who fuck think picks tab $7 trillion worth **debt**?

Fed action take tax money, however creation $7 trillion **debt** lends inflation possibly stagflation. worst kind flation. lead deflation, let's honest, that's going happen 2020. also midst credit debt bubble first started.... so.... bailing corporations gone back acting 2007 seems pretty rwreckless long run, pay it. Let's talk devaluing dollar. Remember testing slow due weekend holiday. Please don’t assume everything magically got better 48 hours. point circumstances ever speaking tiebreaks talking saving lives, especially ""so-called tiebreak win"" Fair enough. likely failure rather strategy. DeSantis avoids taking bit allowing mayors/city mangers/local entities make call. Maintain reelection chances. State govt override orders? Trump declare pandemic ended. Thanks answering internal question religion gets much credit science despite science able perform ""miracles"" whim. think so. provision Indian Penal Code 1860 voluntary work jail sentence fine. challenged shredded court. I’m going read article seems really extreme. 1918 Flu pandemic lasted two years didn’t real medicine. It’s like cancel tourism forever... Oh yeah ☹️ stay away. want anyone get hurt. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Thanks first laugh day! Ooooooooo, Caaaanaaadaaaaaaaa! positive Gen Z moved outlook neutral title false information, implying got 156k new cases July 4th . true. pacific I’ve Covid test it’s painful, wouldn’t want everyday. Doubt letting happen everyone around could care less. still wave. even second wave yet. true. vaccine, vaccinate, going huge herd immunity. Exactly!  sub global pandemic. place insight political violence.  Attempted manslaughter possible. Manslaughter means intention murder attempting would make logical sense. clot related issues u facing? remember Cruiselines refusing refunds wanted cancel trips due fucking Hurricane! (Hurricane Doran SE) 

Fuck Cruise lines. refuse go one sure shit pay taxes claim based tax havens. he's trying damnedest get virus excuse resign. I'm living drawbacks. foster cat got adopted borrowed family dog awhile take back sad/lonely now. offer table foster agency get blind kitten already know end adopting cat. family 2 hours away can't anything can't trust them. go office twice week try best hide everyone work, occasionally see want give anything them. made hamburger buns 4th 70% people going grocery store wearing masks. Thank God Costco requiring masks makes think Hulu show “Handmaid’s Tail” are. don’t work charter schools. work charter school. Quadruple shocked admits worse flu DNR means Resuscitate may know. 

It never happen, did, would probably many wearing masks. Still, change anything. Couple things superspreader-driven pandemics.

1. typically drive heterogeneity susceptibility transmittability up, drives herd immunity thresholds down. key characteristic watch whether people tend get COVID early (most susceptible) people tend transmit widely (transmittable). are, easily see people would become immune early pandemic super spreaders would become rarer rarer, reducing herd immunity threshold.
2. Bans large crowds become important, important form social distancing. Masks close second (you can't really super spreader wearing mask).
3. Super-spreader driven pandemics lot easier control others (say, influenza, super-spreader driven although much less virulent). Seriously? never Disney Universal?

The bulk lines bulk rides inside.

And enclosed box full stationary people gourging food beer shouting nothing like people moving around outside wearing masks.

You make easy.

Kinda boring even.

And x^nth time protests also bad idea. Soooo excited ready this!! What's going here? mean, comments, Room references, candles?  Wat?

Worse what? virus vaping cigarettes. picture make clear aerosols stay air long. Coronavirus isn’t bad fever... use oven analogy...

If everyone ever lived ever baked cupcakes one ever made bread recipe (as prior coronavirus vaccines)... may trust oven bake perfectly fine. 

But first recipe might suck. Maybe there's enough yeast whole thing one massive heavy clump nearly raw dough inedible makes everyone tries sick? second batch, tweaked based results first, far likely resemble actual bread. 

I trust science make thing. trust first manufactured batch, widely untested, rushed production, safe effective second third batches. dare you. working man's beer! suicides 25% higher last year World wide. 2019 880,000, currently six months 2020 551,000 Denmark opened school April without masks. Back transmission levels still relatively high. still able get virus control. Even short, shallow shutdown low public mask adoption levels 2-5 percent. Eh probably White House security compensates it’s bio security rules. know who's taking day reduced staffing causes it, Monday Tuesday consistently low case reporting. bet Thursday week another record setting day.  Switzerland also gave social distance long time ago one ever wearing masks. Unfortunately spike now. also testing aggressively rate positive tests going well, 1%. Since today made masks mandatory public transport, good thing imo I'd surprised effect clubs open big groups allowed. wear masks indoors, everywhere, does. media consume like narrative, know. accurate. exact numbers social distancing much, much less likely get infected. say upset much? I’m arguing shouldn’t responsible, acting like case detailed article realistic expectation contracting isn’t true. Wear mask, socially distance high-risk people, etc. agree that. let’s scare people living lives fear anxiety. You’re weird Sadly, lot people, it’s way change behavior opinion issue like this. Using mortality rate main factor closing closing really terrible idea. Deaths come three five weeks (or sometimes longer) infection. rising mortality rate factor used lockdown lockdown, they've acted late. Seriously, time real? 

If so, thrilled ! volumes* came wife took hydrocloroquine heart palpitations result. Can't kill devil. There’s way don’t. COVID aside aren’t excess deaths huge many states 2020? Complications, blatant number fudging bit there’s way good chunk excess deaths *aren’t* COVID Would love able search date, watch develop spread like radar storm. Would interesting see patterns emerging. difficult purpose. take risk anytime enter building people, avoid can, can't, stay far away people possible risk contract virus, risk goes closer others people building. 99% okay though. That's bit like saying catch HIV dodgy drug needle, caught alley shooting in.

Idk think it’s really good chance Oxford’s vaccine ready September Sentencing someone community service crime committed common practice free world get fucking vaccine stop complaining holy shit. 28% deaths, sounds right.

Pneumonia, Influenza, Stroke Covid-19 symptoms counted Pneumonia, Influenza Stroke, **not** Covid-19, post-mortem tests determine whether person Covid-19.



Seeing host deadly side effects counted blanket disease, seeing lot ""pneumonia"" related deaths would've year. 3 million ?... look statistics countries, it’s death number x 100, roughly speaking. real number probably somewhere near 10 million. ""Brain-dead"" apt phrase feel way many citizens country. Florida governor: stabilized.

Me (choking rage): fUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU plenty options even require go inside get tested. Drive testing popular method seems promise you, none medical professionals performing tests want get COVID. take safety measures seriously kinda assuming without looking testing options. said starved attention u/ibesmokindoe Except one uses Word Immunity Passports, use often ""lättade restriktioner"". DeSantis going blame on? Zach Braff good friends stated family would taken care of, luckily. Mission accomplished... change Well current death toll isnt helping narrative Let us Canada, it'll fine. brains,.......more brains,........brain poutine........

By July 21st, virus magically disappeared too!  live America don’t blame Canadiens one bit wanting that. It’s right thing do, kinda pisses I’ve seeing stories lately many Americans *still* trying get across border. Like cut crap people, make everyone hate us PASTA-DEMIC! feel way “cult celebrity” also think it’s important remember “celebrities” humans job public eye. get sad, insecure, nervous, sick, etc. lot never knew getting set career path. Also Canada 14 day quarantine people coming US, apparently Canada head state law, go figure. You’re getting lot anecdotal evidence you’re wrong yet you’re trying tell us we’re exception. Turns might wrong Weekly surveillance testing doctors nursing home staff probably single effective way use tests.

-We can’t contact trace effectively people won’t share cellphone data

-We don’t really test asymptotic people

-There cure, would influence treatments available individual

All get virus nursing homes, shelter elders place, wait virus become endemic (or maybe vaccine). 

I hate pessimist, rate going herd immunity natural way US. Within last week started show article article written educators bad idea going back school is.

Yeah think schools releasing plans starting sink people much trainwreck gonna be. yep, big brain police work hard believe.... LA County Health briefing showed graph plotting infection rate different age brackets. 18 40 year old cohort surging past month, oldest demographic actually declined. point need tell 20-somethings practice ANTI-social distancing. Going 8 best friends trying keep 6 feet apart masks chin working. doesnt know t-cells are. Anyone peddles majority trampling minority saying ok minority trampling majority. 

For reason system A-ok. letting opinion majority one everyone goes with? thats bad. Lets take least popular idea make everyone adhere that, that's great! Nobody knows sure. hunch mandatory paid sick leave universal health care. people make decision risking spreading virus putting roof family’s head, giving access health care, feeding etc, bet people would choose go work sick didn’t make tough decision. Plus many uninsured may want get tested treated. shutdown exacerbated issue tens millions lost health care coverage it.

When news virus hit, called said would recipe disaster reason. Ohh fully believe I’ll die, that’s wear mask  Well hopefully never drink drive again. deplorable crime. lucky kill someone. places doing. instance hear Washington state increasing infection think Seattle protests, growth eastern Washington food processing plants.

Look California see big cities Mexican border main trouble. 

The souths problem along coastal beaches. Sounds like people repealing votings right act. gotten us Danke! Hell, look Palpatine's unexpected (and mostly unwanted) return. Good him.

If invited see president, I'd skip meeting also. Excuse me?..



Diseases allergens: cockroaches carry large number disease-causing bacteria, including Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Listeria, E. coli, also fungi, viruses parasitic worms. Swedish government would give fuck this. Let carry viral load second lot bars restaurants depend sports events concerts nearby business know right? TX, hell yeah:

 Gov. Ron DeSantis **visited Florida’s largest retirement community Monday** announced average age new cases state DeSantis spoke Villages alongside doctors University Florida Health system said even though state hit new highs COVID-19 cases past week, people testing positive aren’t suffering many “If you’re 21 don’t significant comorbidities, fatality rate pretty much zero,” DeSantis DeSantis pointed deaths Florida among people 65 older said state’s focus trying keep people age range exposed virus, protecting nursing DeSantis said doesn’t believe situation Florida dire New York height **State data shows rate people testing positive Florida climbing close 15%. mid-May, positivity rate “We want get back sure. think we’ve stabilized we’re at,” DeSantis Florida Health Department statistics recorded 6,300 new cases Monday, raising overall total 206,000 since state’s outbreak began March Nearly 3,900 people people tested: 45,000 per day, double figure month ago. **But positivity rate tests past week 18%, four times higher month Since outbreak began, 30 Floridians died per day virus - **and number rising, averaging 43 per day last two weeks.** 

*emphasis mine, bullshit DeSantis'* Maybe. Maybe not.

That’s whole issue, don’t definitively know yet. fair, know long ago Trudeau stated know many times he's done blackface years.  Unfortunately one knows, countries able ban citizen going home..  stage, conversation impossible.

Please return looked ""Marxism"" Wikipedia (or favorite encyclopedia) :) good call whole thing really hard relationships. Best luck hope things work ok.  small price pay olive garden! Yeah, pretty much. lot government starting look pretty heavily weighted favor corrupt action. Thats it, seems harder find negative articles days, drift away main topic Coronavirus, often go internal politics minor political details thus flooding sub anti-Sweden propaganda. European country mentioned often Sweden would say, many countries actually experiencing drastic resurge cases (Romania, Balkan). Agreed, thank you. Ever since posted found countless students similar issues, going coming different countries. really messed nobody talking this.  Umm... what? read article still understand people 21 getting means outbreak stabilized. live Canada, please keep border shut. gladly welcome Americans passes. articles like attempting humanize going around us. people become complacent trying put stories good people died other, thoughtless, maskless, asshole people maybe understand wearing mask go even come hemisphere sacrifice people made.  allowed come whine people jumping conclusions despite claims indeed backed up, offering evidence contrary. 

Here's model, jackass. Sorry can't arsed Seriously? people believe Trump Pence. Lmao. Trump really retarded fuck seem particularly universal, less 50% Americans behaving way I've moved Svalbard 5 years ago. change nationality, Doavki. say fuck Im job anymore. 2014 Ebola: Wildlife talking about. I'm talking WFH better way life, that's debate could argued ways.

I'm specifically talking young people work ethic happy see lockdown continue play fucking video games sleep day. single mother struggling walmart paychecks relate that.

Most people enjoy lockdowns. WFH maybe able actually socialize groups fucking sucks. Everyone know fucking miserable can't much normal summer look like: Going concerts, hitting clubs/bars, going group restaurants, etc.. I'm really bad sewing can't help fit, tell this, things come coffee bags close first open them, great use nose bridge!   kinda reminiscent school children passing tests enough made tests easier know what? Great success! kids passed, go USA! child left behind! Really really, REALLY horrible move. report attempt government. get through, could cause outbreak. Public health nation undermined selfish Swedes. A+ fitting buzzword 'systemic racism' virus scares people.

This sums pretty much! Wow, Yuma's (AZ) 103 cases per 100K day insane. neat tool exploratory data analysis. bookmarking now. Uh no, lot patients isn't.

""Chemo"" refers WIDE array different treatments. vary type, severity, method delivery. bizarre service read *major* news papers online library. Denmark one: I'm told countries too.

Just another way Sweden fails people guess. 

And article relies public opinion surveys. ~~Löfven~~ Putin promised bonus money medics, give. 


Edit: Sorry Putin russia, sweden. number actually dropped! drop absolutely nothing holiday weekend! Yeah, baby 40% drop today, 60% tomorrow, it'll magically gone Thursday latest! make Ducey take responsibilities setting house temporary hospital. Make eat shoes. He's blatantly lying now. political ""side"" anti-mask? Stupid sexy Trudeau Canada better brace gigantic temper man-baby gon throw this... slight! dont think U qualified make statement. Noone Knows true Origin Virus now. Oh sure. totally trust China's numbers, especially beginning outbreak, also hard deny took much extreme measures US preventing spread. lockdown china much much stricter anything seen United States. anyone help analyze video Kelly Victory? mom posted worry contains lot misguided information it. want address unsure start. 

 can't believe cancelled yet. true, remember read either What? seriously idiotic. Get help. Unsubscribe often option people severe mental disorders. often need somebody break trance show light. Well seen lot BLM protests since occurred daily illinois....and would say seen opposite. So, since illinois hasn’t surged, mean since illinois LOT protests? Probably thats dependent everything going plan, chance may not. People barely following safety guidelines imagine start saying expect vaccine soon September assume even people ignoring guidelines spread/strain economy hospitals meantime. right virtue signal.

It's converse/inverse (Which word? Anyone? Inverse?) lionise law enforcement military. done start... followed mask wearing contact tracing Fun fact, Gwalior city Madhya Pradesh, state India.

The word, ""Madhya"" means central, Gwalior Central India. I’m going still hold (blind optimism keep sane) hope we’ll able eradicate virus without vaccine. Anyone follows trumps lead utterly fails Looks data reported province level Canada, US reported granular level. yet crazy aunt came visit refused wear mask :( pay that? People hating people speaking another language something never go away. Anywhere go europe encountered this. Mostly England/Scotland. Im realy suprised people didnt learn Sámi school, piteå. Maby far north. even learn phrases speak högstadiet.   work exactly? pays tests? actual fuck! literally talks ass. We’ve “stabilized” we’re peak testing ability. Please also note level testing time, positive percentage, demography infected Again, like said before, hope right. see good coming election. She'll run 2024 win, I'm sure sad. map unhelpful. numbers speak themselves. US numbers dwarf Canada's. Comparing Toronto' numbers 6 million residents vermont apples oranges. way border opened months US flattens curve. Even US move Chinese style lockdown, numbers change week. Yep. There's real mask narrative America numerous lies half-truths get people comply. Thanks info. least tag ""Good News"" flair one. much bacon clog arteries, may suggest fewer doughnuts? Wow it’s almost like schools care money students.... 


Of course schools care money lol employer recently asked start working tomorrow. job involve taking temperatures handing masks well normal duties. I'm sure I'm comfortable working soon reopening. people feeling going back work? arguement logical fallacy makes sense, bus accidents contagious low risk vaccines, ""done"", siting there, thing that's standing way deployment necessary trials? 

They're done, portion *are* sitting still. thing is, making vaccine difficult. tricky part figuring safe effective, there's trial error done there. could hundreds attempted possible different COVID-19 vaccines invented now, probably handful actually effective, cheap, easy produce, safe enough mass distribution. filter bad ones running expensive, massive trials take months get results come different phases. Realistically, Oxford vaccine almost surely covers criteria now, Pfizer one probably others. small chance aren't, spread billions doses, could create catastrophe, mention anti-vax movement would spread even further. Recent research shows antibodies last long. Many people point may longer antibodies immunity. Impossible confirm now. Unless somehow t-cell testing en masse. 97% getting virus good chance dying make sick 8 days prison without good medical care even mild case chills crack tooth, hallucinations, give lasting organ damage cool cuz didn’t die isn’t pandemic. 

Or get don’t symptoms give someone else gets really sick may die lasting organ damage. that’s cool cuz pandemic death rate low. Even 130,000 deaths. 

Ok. Sounds like party. Watch 200k August. Good luck that... can’t get healthcare Faucci? guess downvoted edit provide sources inquisitive follow up. know deaths related not, realistically. testing bodies. Ironically, testing capacity becoming constrained again, states play testing eligibility again: states testing asymptomatic persons pretty much party wanted tested add constraints like showing symptoms known contact allowing tests.

As happens, expect tests resource constrained states shift pendulum back toward severe cases. Ivanka, too! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ would like see two weeks? That’s different anabolic steroids. They're saying proven antibodies disappear couple months. That's fact. told employer would working home week instituted policy widely. kinda put ass line it, others followed suit strongarmed allowing us. 2 weeks stay home order. people started social distancing quarantining back January realized shit going get real really quick imagine quite won’t able keep lights don’t get enough students enrolled.

— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [October 15, Reading stuff coming Canadian PM seems like they'd make bigger deal it, state owned media right? Except time instead making tests easier stop testing together. 


Just give everybody A’s problems solved. Isn’t Trump genius? Man solved literally worlds problems one sentence. 


Stop testing!  Thanks reminder thay always, always, always, silver lining look! :) Sports music provide lot jobs so... take viagra instead NO-kick? absolutely loved it. I’m introvert all, obligation anywhere amazing. meetings! compulsory social events, travel. 

I’ve stopped drinking, fitter I’ve years, house tidy, caught sleep, started eating right etc etc. feel completely refreshed. 

But best thing going round neighbourhood. Hardly traffic, quiet hear birds trees. Instead cars roads families going walks bike rides together. smell cooking coming houses restaurants closed. like holiday grind. 

10/10 would lockdown again. 

Shame pandemic course. Somewhat relevant, testing made priority, AZ places exceeded containment. Testing solution could prevented failing AZ Federal Gov.

Do link 1/500 claim? *Exceptions apply think, happened 130,000 people far, death tolls likely start sky rocket next weeks. many families torn apart reason. people seem realize magically recover coronavirus calms system: shit fucks whole body, mainly lungs, leaves complications place gone. 'Fun' fact even people known immune HIV/AIDS. 
 

Virology amazing field science. since Bush Jr. greatest generation yet figure yet though rona making confront possibility. said acting brave? merely accepting death rate much lower originally thought...and acknowledging elderly need locked down...not younger people. can’t run away forever. Step one needs open schools. teachers paid, need classroom youngsters. teachers don’t want teach, find new ones will. That’s every profession works. Can’t speak OP, Richmond, VA people mostly masking city. 10 miles outside almost one wearing though. Indoor dining looks fully open, rooms full unmasked people, many older/heavier looking. 

Some yokel told friend didn’t need wear one going gas station/diner week ago. haven’t gotten spike yet, it’s gotta coming. Acting public health... someone either going go wire flat tell dementia man he’s batshit crazy????? What? nothing negative articles, long they're factually correct. Lots articles, positive, negative neutral, not. Depends atmospheric conditions extended contact others is. stabilized change graph line increase sharply. max amount tops 7 billion. /s Union rules all. sanitation worker lumberjack likely die job cop is. hundreds hundreds pictures seeing showing 95% wearing masks. gloves, shields, goggles? understand info comes like this. can't believe conspiracy theories. Duh, you’re Reddit full 18-30 year olds. Unfortunately point, survey wasn’t 1/3 Reddit users report....

In actual random sample, there’s lot people like moved office job WFH like life lot way. employer makes return, they’ve said won’t, I’d quit another remote job. I’m particularly introverted, learned love working home I’m better employee way recognized employer.

It doesn’t speak anything virus people’s attitudes towards lockdown, shows working office fucking sucks drains people’s lives. never forget disinfectant/UV light press conference. visible cringing experts around spewed nonsense gold Staff shortages going cripple traditional school. teachers get covid, use sick days mandatory 2 week quarantine? child gets stay home them? think teachers unions need get questions answered educators. hope so. work university, they're returning almost everyone campus fall. Counterpoint: undercounted number excess deaths time pandemic. IDK people downvoting you. pointed unsafe probably wont go back due that. Hopefully dont live anyone susceptible dont see go open thought safetly measures put place. gym appointment one person per section mask required times. fully recovered. actually sent hospital secondary bacterial infection. thankfully Antibiotics. three months since got coronavirus happy back normal self. Yesterday 1.5h cycling tour. amazing :) I'm shocked!!!!!!!!!!! shocked!!! doesn’t be,omg it’s article paid service. didn’t read it, you? worth noting cytokine storm rare complication virus. reason Spanish flu deadly common cytokine storm think mean know gets transferred via droplets (somebody coughs breathe tge droplets directly close by), research also conducted maybe airbourne.... means somebody coughs hangs air somentime maybe even gets transported somebody breathes in. Two different scenarios. Anti-maskers already lost cause. still seems much stupidity ignorance masks actually do, though. complete psychopaths might go, ""Oh, fuck, realize..."" actually amend behavior. masses I'm worried about, loudly stupid refuse change.

But also, even assholes usually want *see* assholes, making people either means basically admit they're asshole, something it. bullshit think time write nice letters loved one.

But you’re right, sound bad. Sorry Tom Hanks! leg amputation due blood clots Tom Hanks goddamn (inter)national treasure. course made it!!! People still think underlying problems nothing happen healthy unfortunately. would imagine 2021 travel would still highly regulated whatever forms established now. doubt we'd borders open 2019 soon. new virus popping may opportunity spread far &amp; wide may say 2029 whenever started relax things &amp; become comfortable back BAU COVID-19. mean time global pandemics? visit Germany US . early march works pharmacy, likely it. symptoms showed, called doctor tell get tested admitted hospital unless fever broke 100 degrees breathing life threatening. yea,it ole ""don't get tested assume it."" China 2.0 sorry hear, stay strong internet stranger Ooooo. Rock died AIDS. good comparison. 😳🧐🤗 would make worse. Anti makers care hear masks help others, they'll double down. Flu kill anyone anytime well. What's point? long term permanent damage makes think come China? Ok cool. let virus run rampant see happens? take seriously don’t large numbers preventable deaths?  OMG...this thing really political people. matter you?

I real scientific information you: Removing President Trump office cure coronavirus. can’t take person classes. stupid plan isn’t surprising given government doesn’t want nonimmigrants here. So, different names? seems silly. Oh see looks bad, meant reply another discussion. Looks bad context. struggling new app update  got pretty low standards shit creek chicken wire canoe. Damn... last week tonight episode right think demise US, definitely ICU life support right now..

Thank link. eye opening. especially liked Trump started COVID-19 briefings, hoping would provide helpful tips like that. used time pat back, air grievances, promote quackery.  answer no, many know it, they've gotten base fired issue trouble backtracking CCP silence criticize it. policy believed caused virus escape China. CCP allowed free exchange ideas world would known early enough. Depending kids split up, may much social interaction would like. split groups ten, kids smaller groups allowed play (I preschool). Therefore, one kid two playmates entire ten-hour day really supposed change it. trying avoid one gender two other, going 100% avoidable, therefore kids could literally ""no one play with"" cross gender barrier. girl two boys, odds getting play Barbies you?

Parents sending ""play friends"", majority day likely watching friend play across room people get ""yelled at"" teacher try join them.

I would see individual school's plan much interaction actually going allowed making decisions.  think parents' impressions school going play before, smaller groups. Well mean tmobile, sure, id recommend verizon Canada officially called  agree obviously incorrect reopenings would lead increase cases states already hit hard. convincing evidence suggest outcome, plenty evidence suggest otherwise (South Korea Iran). However, significant increases treatment massively improved public health policy, including far better protection nursing homes, suggest situation death numbers different. Case point, Oxford researchers finding survival rates among hospitalized patients increasing. we’re seeing is, opinion, correction ratio infections deaths. massive mortality rate NYC area beginning pandemic result inexperienced doctors, doctors time, dealing entirely new virus, inadequate protection elderly. understand virus improving treatment every day, death count correcting itself. reporting done government employees, mostly work weekends. animal meat tasty, people eat it.

The truth Americans admit failed government individual level, cases go down. honestly cannot foresee border opening anytime soon lack introspection southern side border. even prison, jail. put people arrested yet tried. odds someone innocent, petty issue might make ""scourge society"" much higher.

So expect see another lockdown death late August people great time then. Ohhh third infectious disease eradicated? Polio measles? Swedish propaganda action Honestly, I'd like spin news mainland China coronavirus.

But none make front page....

Yes, Chinese coronavirus longer front page news, little things like Beijing testing 11 million people Beijing's July 5 confirmed case fruit vegetable chain promoter....

Instead, ""neoconaviruses appeared elsewhere appeared Asia"" article gets attention.... Sympathy, anyone? No...? None here, move along... Reasonable accommodation.

Someone disabled can't wear mask?

A reasonable accommodation would curbside pickup. 

End story. enter without mask. pass GO. collect $200.

Stay safe, good luck! Check comment history. I've linked paper multiple times. Thank you! received rude comments people outside healthcare assuming opposite. travel literally see everything encounter every type population think that’s develop medical knowledge people skills. usually couple days training new facilit, often given difficult assignments regular staff want take adaptable. 


Not gonna lie though, encountered truly horrible travel nurses, less fact travelers fact EVERY occupation, contractor not, people bad fits really lazy workers. Based picture article believe they’re talking March here, July. It’s tough tell apparently get first paragraph article everything lines crisis first hit, clue they’re publishing Way go! That's awesome :) Trump literally worst person President right this. mind blowing people still back him. Wait die?? may kids suffer kind TEMPORARY psychological impact distance online learning. School important social center kids/teens. fact.

However, think anyone wants parent 1 7 kids gets inflammatory deal goes real bad. Moreover, infections skew growth younger younger groups (right average age hospitalization 35-45), already know kids Teens get die well, figure least parents educators might decide - can't logistically implement realistic safety measures - paying therapy dealing delay social growth likely better disabled/dead kids.

I 'keep kids home forever' anyone home forever', matter, camp. think enough date data (the data CDC APA using recs months old necessarily accurate more) rush send kids back person.

Look what's happening across country right now. That's enough hesitant cram kids back climate controlled, poorly designed school buildings.

I want one 'rare' parents burying child watching bright inquisitive kid become mentally physically disabled home schooled MIGHT give access wide range social interactions.

That's me. parents make choices. best way understand become political situation. one hand, Democrats want protect people listen scientists results things needing shut curb virus hand Republicans want listen scientists shutting things means hurting donors wallets means need approach virus something serious is. might saying ""Oh we're Canada, affect us Republicans America saying it."" Well, good sir madam, people want side democrats need someone power position i.e. political position say hoax wearing mask anything belief cemented truth them. matter politicians walk back anything, said become truth. back Trump calling hoax, Republicans screeching worth shutting things certain percentage population needed create realities. way people jam packed protests time.  Holy shit water parks still open? Even Fckn Arizona closed water parks. Incorrect title. It’s England opening pubs.

I'm sorry poor wife. issues don’t mind asking? something ""see serious"" attitude consistently see around Service guarantees citizenship, sort deal? think 5 tested positive weekend.  Really, business owner doesn’t want let without mask, It’s business option refuse, long he’s discriminating letting without. vaccines takes hold, curves going change greatly.

The herd immunity better, certain point virus much harder time wild, start burning areas faster/easier currently.

We can't eliminate risks 100%, radically diminish them. goes people at-risk well, protected herd immunity well. We're trying escape. comment confusing relevant think. 

The point closed longer safe open. Greater Toronto Area opened week 10 days ago deciding now, gets control like Texas, Arizona, Florida, California, start wearing masks. lock Canadians part respected social distanced go out. going wear masks risk areas. said done way mask compliance country USA. bet - shit sucks every way Shutting early wasted opened quickly.

Covid nothing skin colour. racist default. That's insane.

If want understand Asian racism, read. promise you, appalling. compromise competition. racism bad. Innate immunity sucks phat balls though. cells hairy ones.

Measles gives person lifetime immunity, highly contagious, never got herd immunity it, making vaccine necessary. still, popping place, usually due activities intentional spreaders. love humor, aren’t funny. 
Sorry breaks heart. cannot imagine wife feeling right now. It’s one thing lose loved one, it’s another watch struggle 90+ days, start gain hope, fall apart already reopening cases still consietently going down. Weve heard ""just wait two weeks X"" since April, knock wood never happens.

It really Toronto area lagging behind short farm outbreaks lately, rest Canada save Quebec done exceptional far faced massive restrictions.

According Instagram post wife, didn’t pre-existing conditions. sad story around. think replace doctor ICU nurse hours/days even weeks/months basic training serious misunderstanding medical professionals.

Personally would love go bars friends again. realize right possible safely. Multiple community outbreaks tied bars. possible keep cases control enough people follow guidelines, wear masks, avoid physical gatherings people outside household. cities, states countries proven this.

Throwing hands saying people want get drink let ignoring reality helping cause massive spike cases, hospitalizations, probable future deaths. mom followed story ever since day Nick admitted hospital, devastated. feel Elvis especially since dad passed away around age. heartbreaking...

Now you’re saying want data medical journey literally MILLIONS people infected coronavirus? exactly assume approach gather information reporting statistical studies new information comes in? imagine thinking people critique Bill Gates retarded QAnon bros. will, long everyone knows someone dealing worse.

Why would best squeeze juice it? excess death data June 13, unless I'm missing something.  tell us much recent apparent upticks new cases areas getting hit hard now. 

I'm still hopeful death rate getting lower though. Yes, *but enjoy them!* /s foreigner, Detroit see big protests month ago? Seems current spike COVID USA hard blame BLM movement way. work disinfecting. disinfect places COVID been. Wbu? said mortality rate low people aren’t obese, implying they’re ones affected...

I am, cause people like aren’t. Every entitled piece shit we’ve got country. Global warming let us go back normal. 10 years effects severe. competition? I've read like Spanish flu, covid cause cytokine storm, body's immune system ends attacking fact killing healthy people. were/are testing anti-malarials treatment immuno response malaria result extremely damaging inflammation. Pretty hard ignore shitting vomiting blood.  NYC didn’t see exponential growth? growth see? I’m confused statement Yes it’s pretty good years people used lot fewer folks would die. Pretty sure stupid people, ages. exactly. probably feeds kids. father healthy died. clean physical. know fit narrative. It’s several weeks. Exactly many want? Cases spiking since protests started. deaths you’re hoping for? Sure, generation really admired USA kind miss it. hope guys make back good times. abhors bad news. aides lie constantly otherwise invites unending rage. There's positive spin whatsoever. perform worst western country. person look perfectly healthy still high risk.

I never claimed otherwise. hope sheltering place. Absolutely love need post day this. sounds like Government propaganda, even Ministry Science Technology contradicted ICMR's statement saying vaccine would available 2021 latest. ain't happening sure. No, unfortunately fusion power problem cost. actually don’t tech right replace fossil fuels fusion power plant. produced fusion energy, sure, stands takes energy heat hydrogen incredibly high temperatures required fuse helium fusion reaction produces. goal build fusion reactor sustain long period time started like sun, yet achieved may well decades.

That said, plenty working alternatives fossil fuels could scaled investment (solar wind example). time place dude. must slow. Generally speaking, long people distancing properly, beach pretty low risk place hang out. gotta directive straight Kemp's office. want wall built around NYC. course 13 weeks, Tony Award-nominated star endured several difficulties hospitalization, including undergoing leg amputation, waking medically-induced coma procedures temporary pacemaker. know everyone feels terrible terrible, man suffered fucking much.

Thank sir. muh rIgHtS “I protest. swear!” Toronto lot. Good read. govt eventually step in, it’s matter when. willful compliance failing. don’t know 1 million 2 million deaths convince them, maybe 10 million. Italy Spain moment actually start fix this. Tell visit med center (starting flashbacks interchangeable Nokia phone ""faceplates"") shows 57 deaths July 16th peak death 72 / day.

Remember Tri-state 2000 deaths per day peak. even ball park numbers much fodder ""It's flu"" crowd Cries American r/theydidthemath Can’t seem get anything done.

In year passed biggest stimulus package ever. Please sue them. protests happened everywhere upticks happen everywhere.

If protests indeed contribute spikes would everywhere. NYC raging inferno virus far isn't. [Excess deaths whole consistently going down, even according lag fact seems like undercounting begging pandemic.

I think likely explanation deaths still going simply lag behind cases/hospitalizations, getting better treatment average age going down. get getting voted. reason flu seem bad fighting 100 years we've dealing covid like 6 months. poor wife. I'm impression combination things causing rise infections. Dont celebrate yet. going 100 million doses year end. US alone needs 320 million - I'm sure arent getting 100 million. 

The world need 4 billion doses.  informative! Would agree reinfection quickly likely outlier, people somewhat longer term protection? Like least 6 months? would gladly get shot twice year end this. Wtf, healthy begin with, stop talking shet There's reason gotten sick. called quarantine. can't believe administration claiming 99% cases ""totally harmless"" ""just disappear"". There's significant number Americans believe nonsense. kind nightmare living in? Get grip. I’ve lost someone virus even us personally affected upset death high profile rooting recovery. 30 days? Weak. Maybe east coast little level headed this. don’t see masks public suburbs portland, streets wide enough people cross steer clear.

I’m keeping defense mechanism getting infected thing plays out. afterward, I’m leave three decades worrying sickness dust. Life short crap! I’ll purposely breathe toxic waste burns. Meanwhile Toronto zero ICU cases Yeah I’m aware article. We’re fine, back &lt;600 new cases today. fully eliminate it? Probably not, it’s rare NY whole bunch diseases nobody bothers test 60k people daily basis. I'm huge progressive, fun assumptions. hateful could lead chronic inflammation. Afaik pretty clear evidence pangolins bridge species allowed virus mutate spread humans. agree consider possibilities probable country origin one native populations pangolins. Sorry forgot /r/Coronavirus. Calamity always “two weeks away”.

I've 10+ restaurants take last months, signs say 5 people one time, definitely enforcing this. would say often 5 people inside, stood outside waited less people inside. even times people tried go around waited, irritating little bit funny. completely agree, kind like everyone protested masks signed waiving medical care COVID form nouwrong know sounds silly I've I've following story months. ups downs, struggles family doctors. kind long shot, young healthy prime life guess always hope.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Imma call water one. least likely bunch called [harvesting continuing trend; mask debate nothing IQ test. 

Wear god damned mask part keeping everyone safe. 

It's easy. Jax know already signatures canvassing reject it. I’m sure numbers Jax people doesn’t want it. got governor lunatic bone mayor dingo doesn’t care. Please American, let us in, right thing. varys wildly age health viral load area moment 3.99% someone mostly mask-hating family (I fine them) say least relatives one biggest reasons mask hating lack of:

1) understanding science 
2) confusion anger changing “rules” regarding masks
3) sense hopelessness agency life change

That third point one seen discussed much Reddit. 

My relatives don’t want wear mask overwhelmed nutritional health science feel defeated world medicine. overweight addicted sugar spent years binge diets one form another. 

Wearing mask abstract form self care care don’t really connect well. people eating dessert lunches every dinner know watch weight scared get scale look mirror. 

Plus wearing mask genuinely harder. don’t move well. get overheated get embarrassed. It’s harder breathe normally walking length Home Depot. Add mask it’s worse. 

It’s sad course concerned caring others themselves. certain extent are. also risk factors make susceptible disease’s worst consequences come part lifestyle choices make less likely feel agency health all. 

Put another way - wife, fit, adds mask wearing list dozens things health self care already, success, knowing actions benefit her. 

My relatives, fit, add mask wearing list dozen things health self care already don’t feel confident ability shift health reality. 

They still wear masks encourage strongly so. understand feels like one-more-thing-to-do long list things already defeated by. 

Of course it’s much easier proclaim it’s rights admit everything wrote out. NY numbers never match Cuomo says. know get data Look cause mortality. long. stand corrected part Navy sailors manifest fully negative COVID-19 test positive tests. Koreatown case also negative test reported, Redditors COVID19positive giving true accounts (I see wouldn't), also negative tests testing positive again. linked article also indicates negative test turning positive again--again one could argue variations testing protocol could factor, would clinically (symptomatically) negative between, turn positive later virus coming back?

Looking big picture, suppose say (at least cases) relapse uncleared virus instead reinfection. really better immunological standpoint? seems happening young healthy people would indicate immune system, whether reinfection relapse, often difficulty clearing it. could disagree more. father “rising 1st Grader,” can’t think important time child classroom, developmentally speaking. would prefer reallocate *upper* grades’ resources serve youngest children, are—if we’re honest ourselves—quite incapable distance learning. High schoolers (and especially juniors/seniors) already basic tools required learn things, perfectly comfortable things online. Six year olds don’t skill set. Maybe shouldn’t marry 3 times... think lot Americans idea everywhere else world happily wearing masks. really dont think case. private healthcare immunizations free. get flu shot year free. Coronavirus tests also free, co-pay waived. 

It financial self interest make testing vaccination covered free, costs paying sick people treatment far more. 3 states reporting weekend, believe  Asian American dealt racism. late February, asked 4x whether went China everyone else asked once... people street lash stay extra far away (basically across street) even though walking white people. I'd interested stats across years regular poll. Well, see, share single brain, unfortunately belongs Trump right now, decides do. questions asked. Again, aren’t reading others saying. I’m wondering ideology reopening cause cases going up, community spread places reopening. Every time local county announced next phase repening MIL would link article cheer, would tell way mean safe things go back normal. mean, govt says ‘ok, start reopening’ people go, ‘oh, things going back normal’ hang friends, hang family, let guard etc. know feels like preaching choir general public really needs hand held get us pandemic, sigh. Young, healthy, dead.

Thanks asshokes can't mildly inconvenienced order stop global fuckin pandemic We’re imperial decline. surprise always money. OK Karen. That's guy gets salsa New York City hostility? crapitalisn. That's kind general pattern prolonged serious hospital stay. point secondary effects treated big deal primary effects disease itself. Obviously trying say hospitals bad anything like that, still disease's fault would way worse without treatment all. learn basics K-12. assume it’s grown version happens that.

Sure, everyone learns basic research papers vet cite sources. graduate never apply skills anything outside context, politics products. 

In words, lot people make grade get certificate drop everything directly used everyday tasks door way out. No. Next question. effective treatments. % dead better San Antonio here. saw lot friends posting pictures backyard parties. 15-20 ppl masks. neighbors party stay inside safe. Trails packed restaurants packed. I’m terrified next weeks going look like. Idk, maybe go medical/ pharmacology school find out. outdated notion.

90% complaints PPP 2nd round people gotten re-educated. thanks friend Look one could seen sunbelt surge like summer.

I mean sure seen cases grow exponentially month now, who’s say why?

I mean long time ago passed responsibility onto citizens FL right thing, I’m sure you’re even bringing this. surface-level show. Window dressing makes people feel better nothing. know dont live desert island alone? work, arent perfect think wearing masks infringe freedom, wear pants? Population wise, there's bit difference: 

 Canada: 37 Million + versus US: 328.2 Million +

Toronto's population 2.93 Million _ - NYC population 8.33+ Million

Think that. fault, saving ""Do kids"" rainy day. Perhaps certain subset country constantly attempting defund mismanage VA attempt justify privatization, giving lip-service ""supporting troops"" instead funded correctly, VA might better.

The bad part lockdown reason situation - lockdown amazing. FOLLOW? kidding. Easier harder them, especially 18 15 year olds. happened many times proven (like airconditioners coolers playing role f.e. meat processing plants, singing churches etc.) would pull conclusions. reason wait experts proving stuff. basically best advice every single aspect virus, especially experts governmental organisations best taking grain salt. Australua, New South Wales South Australia closed borders state Victoria - 500 cops plus Army enforcing it. $11,000 fine / 6 months jail breaking quarantine. muck around. disgraceful 115 new coronavirus cases today boom lowered them. love lock down. want people 6 feet away on.

This hotly debated Ebola, SARS, Swine Flu breakouts well, never established study, evidence, experiment, etc. either, though consensus airborne transmission.

You can't ethically run actual experiment measure actual airborne transmission would require intentionally infect people virus. approximations, aerosolizing fluid containing virus air measuring long viable, statistical analysis past, guesses often fall apart peer review.

To say ""spin"" simply statement facts. dozens articles past 6 months virus past 15 years viruses topic. scientific method limitations can't prove everything. anecdotal evidence airborne transmission scientists frank saying know virus spread.

Reason Nr. 56 **you treat COVID-19 &amp; pandemic bit seriously!** Even though parts US / world pandemic bit manageable, shouldn’t get complacent, always guard protecting health. It’s definitely “not flu”, unfortunately we’re seeing notable celebrities get sick &amp; die. 

Rest piece Nick, still fond memories going see “The Waitress” Broadway New York City several years ago. Let’s hope people think pandemic “isn’t serious” finally agree heed warnings tone lifestyles bit. prioritise vulnerable, effectively 'kick' virus far fewer 320 million doses. vast majority young people need overly concerned, vaccinate elderly/vulnerable enough get back 'normal' (whatever is). developed [Acute Respiratory Distress left unable oxygenate sufficiently without ventilator. pure speculation, mutations Covid19 shown weak antibodies Oxford vaccine produces Well think it, US ur work due covid get sweet sweet unemployment bonus... soo get covid.. oh yeah gonna take looooong 'recover'.. atleast Im getting monies. Same. TBH never heard Covid story came out. following closely ever since. knew deep odds slim. hits hard right now. Staying thing last... two papers saying thing? Got it. Blaming legislative branch executive failure. Well, them, open means take increasingly risky actions. countey deserves whats coming Great! Glad hear Define recovered? Europe's deaths infections heavily weighted towards beginning pandemic. started later, troughed, infection rate came roaring back reopened (prematurely, half-hearted stay home orders) not. 

Although treatment improved, improved much expect US death rate remain stably low, especially looking overflow capacity triage hospitals several states. 

If keep going way, several massive waves manage spot outbreaks. that’s skip pain killers source this? Genuinely curious. fact common ancestor types, Type A, found highest numbers (10% Chicago) US also tells something.

Yeah tells virus mutated twice far. One mutant strains contained China however original strain likely spread Europe (and US), virus mutated new strain original continued spreading. That's it. say time get comfy over? 100 million US. countries ordered additional doses know. It’s awful. several news outlets tweeting guy today. Maybe testing isn’t massive. 

There rise Coronavirus cases testing massive good, far bigger better country. great news, even better news death, death rate, DOWN. Also, younger people, get better much easier faster!

Waning immunity potential relapse reinfection appear likely given weight current evidence, community lets COVID-19 run wild mass-infect population--with (in US) 5 percent death rate even higher rate severe organ damage survivors--with worst worlds. 

Large numbers dead sick people, also likely loss immunity within couple months (once again) vulnerable population. officials like sociopathic Lt.

Looking likely manageable immunity come combination booster shots perhaps immunotherapy hospital setting, along ongoing public health moves including social distancing masks reduce total spread first place. US, means really need form universal healthcare else people get tested early enough. flawed response UK been, could never gotten control without NHS universal health care EU keep viral loads down. people afraid medical bills get tested treated, viral loads spiral upward much time wind hospital, they'll susceptible transmitting getting everyone else sick, making harder measures (including booster immunisations) able keep bay affected communities. fucking fake statistic know it. That's deaths lag behind hospitalizations, also going up.

You even privileged guy Im NY coworker went SC weekend. planned trip January it’s hotspot quarantine 14 days. guess didn’t want cancel trip 1/3 COVID 19 ICU patients: also evidenced “milder” cases “Covid toes”. It’s actually quite known point causes significant issues blood clotting. mean? reaching what’s reach? Waaaaay people Embarrassing live country that’s norm. people know lie, cheat steal much possibly can. assemble people larger groups, would behavior change? would best possible outcome. Especially gives long term immunity disease forms. Fingers crossed, 2 weeks usually cover strike. crazy money too, like 15-20k 2 weeks. So? countries reporting single, double digit deaths still take virus far seriously US population.  Yeah, college going total nightmare. Young adults get infected spread coronavirus like wildfire. class indoors 50 students many wearing masks recipe super spreading event. Someone please tell horrific sever cases Covid-19 like people asymptomatic get headache sore throat. blood type? determining wether someone severe case not? can't scientists/health experts answer yet? Philippines. Dr Fauci, Birx, Surgeon General said back March need wash hands stay magical distance 6ft away people. end majority students actually want back person, online learning ass. PNW did. clue, throwing shit yelling things asian Americans racist piece shit way addressing problem. engaging racist piece shit behavior? Disney still opening next weekend? like cut jib. #hindsight2020

I mean, come on. sinking feeling CPS come plan fall teachers union say ""f**k - that."" first strategy fully implemented? US sticks broken democracy, sure. need scientific dictatorship right now. What’s going funny re-reopen early Yea might work, desktop air filtration units use UV (not sure effectiveness). One caution however intense UV radiation converts oxygen ozone, toxic inhale. 

I know countries experimenting sanitizing things like public transport UV light. HVAC system proper filters and/or recirculating air though pretty substantial itself. Sorry, can't come in. US shit bed covid front. Keep yourselves. K, thanks. Mine actually almost $1,000 year. go virtual classrooms longer need community schools. videos created USA schools, proctored low paid assistants. want, could see happen. bet school administration wants kids back school, lot jobs risk. sure college level could done. that’s scary think about. someone might make 2021 idea show example mind? I'm sure mean exactly. someone working face face people, puts sort ease. likely Brazos county 49% positivity rate, testing people sure exposed That's point.

I'm saying even masks *were* useless staying 6 feet apart going outside 'bubble' still good things practice. Good luck USA. unionized, zero issue striking money maybe strike health safety? plan going soon gyms open. Luckily live Canada open gyms safer so. US close state borders? laws even allow that? forced told, America that’s way it’s supposed be,” Dorris said. “Anything feels like tyranny, right rebel it.”

It's ok guys - felt oppressed, right it..... useful skill replace idea formal education? think so. People meme certain degrees pointless useful, degree proof expert certain subject. That's really it. 4 years get accredited something later put resume used certain circumstances. can't become expert topic solely (keyword) relying Google. There's even statement, C.D.C. cited “national security reasons” rationale releasing information decision. holiday weekend. Lots places reporting deaths. Lets see numbers look like beginning next week jumping conclusions. wishes brain kept alive costs transplanted robot body first opportunity. 🤖 Yeah, thats required too, sick, liquor store, still spread hand hand contact, best use leave. hooray well done Toronto Northern Ireland also 0 Covid-19 patients ICU, South East NHS Region England 1. see actual mortality rate Texas determine total number cases. 

There's bias here.  Actual numbers biased. test results, statistics opinions.   true mortality rate COVID-19 around 0.2% even less.  Texas flat curve.  point shutdowns?  Seemed worked.  There's spike deaths.  We'll keep eye.  

Note say 'current death rate 1.4% Texas - misleading - say current death rate, even scientific? scare tactic.   many millions people Texas, many dead?  plague. seemed privileged try ignorant lucky are.


Says person insists $420/year use someone else's gym equipment risking personal health privileged. Check privilege. original commenter right- exercising home cheaper, take lot space. set ankle weights cost like $20 (They take maybe cubic foot space shelf). bought 6 years ago. also found theraband free ago. pretty darn good weight training those, I'm spending thousands dollars (like would gym membership span 6+ years). also conditions affect joints. take walks use walking place YouTube videos can't go outside. get gym workout free, 650 square foot apartment. Lucky man it’s 97.5% shared mice. yeah, SARS-CoV-2 shares much ""predecessor"" humans share mice. wild. Dude hate us. point traveled somewhere else would tell people Canadian sheer humiliation. honestly can’t believe people don’t know respiratory disease, vascular one well enough healthcare firms go belly up, *could* lead big fail type nationalization bailout. Emphasis **could**. Xinhua, state controlled media, - still - sticking neck out. Hopefully becomes trend PTSD exists time even vaccines out. Lots football players things like this. LeBron James reportedly lost something like 15 lbs, water weight, playoff run. cardio capacity, especially size, playing 46 minutes night 2 months straight insane. Although teammate. Happy cake day! Mid April even.  


ICU patients dropping too:  Marshall, Royce, Sean guys gonna diss virus? He's clearly total douche. wife actually die (or get worse)? fact alone argues doctors right wrong, it. least succeeded pestering giving script almost certainly ineffective antibiotics. Drugs absolutely nothing viral illness, wife almost certainly suffering. thought CARES act stopped work search requirements ? Computational biologist Bing Liu U Pittsburgh, working Covid-19 research, said ""breakthrough progress"", shot home three times head, neck chest, classical CIA style execution, carried another old Chinese scientist ""suicides"" car later day.

Local police Pittsburgh announced murdered ""Love triangle affair"" shortly death. released long WeChat dialog murder's wife, match style 21 century online Chinese conversation two fresh-off-the-boat immigrants. blatant display stupidity willfully endangering public large, shut indefinitely. Covid patients regularly put blood thinners part plan care. yes.  Everybody would like socialize friends beer. Everybody. However, bars essential given situation viral pandemic without vaccine consequences another outbreak/lock down, caution taken. People could acting caution. Particularly bars parts US shutting upticks viral spread again. example many people feel apply them. old story again.

Also, describing believe characteristics people make poor decisions, attacking poor. fair minded reader post would recognize that.

If feel post describes you, hope rethink decisions. not, nothing upset keep moving. Yep. hobbies lean introvert feel background anxiety p much everyday upcoming college senior come leg amputated? lolz? Sorry, previous comment error. disagree logic. seeking world risk zero. need risk zero able live 'normal' lives. need 'herd immunity' live normal lives. lower risk manageable levels high enough vaccination level makes risk infection lot lower 'herd immunity'. Sure, outbreaks still happen. live lives risk. ridiculous look incredibly low death rate among under-30s, example, suggest people cannot get lives manageable risk. Life comes big risk factor. Vaccination vulnerable first allows us live risk. Ergo, 'need' 320 million vaccinations get back living lives. Zero risk goal. Manageable risk goal. saying goal vaccinate 320 million people. saying live manageable risk well get 320 million vaccinations. sadly accurate, honestly. anyone Trump I'd say statement hyperbole. right protest without potentially judged sedition incredibly broadly worded law maximum penalty life imprisonment. Back day shut trap dug trench like told. Jk got two girls home ready burn motherfucker pookie! might one could get coronavirus symptoms, could end ICU,"" Hart said. ""You could age death bed there's going anyone beside you. parents going hold hand. They're going tell everything going okay."" Link? sorry hear mom, deepest condolences. Nice job Michigan! gov stuck guns it’s working out. fucking sad heard , literally mentioning struggle way saying fucked coronavirus really get 


And someone said “he died right?”

I googled like “fuck man , haven’t reddit much today would seen it”

Sad , horrible, “just flu bro” fuck 

Rip nick key component “beating” virus prepared manage subsequent outbreaks occur. Flare-ups always possibility due either chain local cases going undetected (like Victoria) international travel (like Beijing outbreak). Australia taking step like sign success, failure. economic societal impacts closing border would pale comparison impacts virus spreading control across country. authorities acknowledging honesty don’t outbreak control yet willing take step good thing. extrapolating much. article says, FDA established benchmark that COVID-19 vaccine ""would prevent disease decrease severity least 50% people vaccinated.""

This imply pandemic stay. implies FDA US ready declare vaccine ready prevents treats *at least* 50% subjects clinical trials. 50% success rate huge step forward anyway. Right evidence-based treatment viral infection. 

Plus, successful even one vaccine, would first coronavirus, already medical breakthrough. certainly last making. like like nba basketball It’s easy lump Austin rest Texas, please don’t. I’m sure dumbasses Austin too, they’re far progressive rest state. tight knit community Discord chat watching movies together weekly. watching *Overwatch League* weekends sport fix hockey hiatus. personal library I’ve collecting years I’m reading more. Steam Summer sale single player campaign games dive in. 

I’m mentioning parents acting like children, like *they’re soooooo bored* can’t go outside play. It’s sad watch people world fingertips home miss opportunity new experiences haven’t changed along time. Xi charge back January Zhong Nanshan went national TV said ""nah, limited H2H transmission bullshit, there's definitely large scale H2H transmission going on""? Yikes. That’s horrible startling. effort whatsoever classify deaths properly. I'm sure gain that. America chapter history (and economic) books COVID. They're indicating that's many new cases they've confirmed. 150k+ got sick last week. correct number generated holiday festivities likely higher. know bit. Winnie Pooh charge then.

And time said this, China already apologised Li's treatment, - - sticking neck out. control ... That’s great analogy too! used seatbelts it’s something that’s fun demanding still difference life death guess less others scenario. I’ll use need :)  College starting autumn mega trainwreck. Granted LA County alone population bigger population 43 50 states, still pretty fucked up! actually shapeshifting amoeboflagellate excavate likely came lab US. It’s true. get angry, silently behind mask, see folks...failing keep safe wearing mask staying away me. don’t want see another 3+ months cancelled kids feels inevitable live Brazil. top politicians like you. average thousand dead per day, rising, idea stop.

Yes, politicians making wear mask fucking worth it.

Do know Brazil undeveloped country? Cause full people like you. that, probably widespread vitamin deficit. darker skin, lower level vitamin D. 4 years magical drunken fuckfest Disneyland

when ya put like that, $50k-$90k per year sound bad XD political all. whatever So, get infected low viral load. Got it...so infect low viral load, mean, gets control, we're going get infected anyway, right? Yes that's point. day 51 enough two lakes. Day 52 enough 4 lakes. Canada Australia bigger diverse NZ, comparatively OK. I’ve got two autoimmune diseases weigh 110 pounds. think ya need check facts. 

A person look perfectly healthy still high risk. Presumably want spend rest life stupid arsehole. ready dump yet least isolate couple weeks. WaPo article actually cite elected officials, appointed officials.

To clear, I'm saying people social distancing wearing masks, WaPo joke. feeling better? hate you, need break. Find that...maybe backpack Europe apparently Canadians allowed now. Omg nick Cordero! mother live? Scientists tracing mutations concluded current variations virus descended case November 2019. don’t understand concept exponential growth, congratulations. sooo in. 

Freedumb

The Zona Rona (for Arizona)

And Ivanka see manager would it? common cold isnt killing hundreds thousanda people within 4 months. Good thing mortality rate low people obese. 👍 Politicians making statements infectious disease unless high level background medicine, specifically epidemiology case. Even letting experts tell us what's best. course fucking politicize medicine are. fucking learning US basically large scale collapse. I'm usually one call doomers I've seeing people past couple months I'm sure us go sort reasonable direction. I'm sorry.  ...turn tables? Yeah. silent majority happy state decision locked home. 100 Huntington Beach protesting caved. would fuck wildlife though comes old age obesity. lot people die majority old obese intersection those. Humber (sp?) hospital highest obesity Toronto. deaths globally nursing homes continue aren’t relentless. Second sick US least one third population obese. Gives new meaning “morbidly obese”. developing nations gluttony supposed sin, it’s norm. Many countries ways deal you’re going tell bunch cowboys don’t right eat death. [How Japan Deals Obesity Yeah I’ve got idea would absolutely surprise actual slavery. 

Those cruise lines horrible employees. Well tests basis case counts too, yes case counts also bullshit exact reason; voluntary testing source reporting rate data like this. definitive data hospitalizations deaths, everything else simply misleading public consumption. Like trump said; tested less we'd see less cases That's see long ass lines people waiting get tested

right thats exactly small minority infected people (and small minority; much less 50%, closer 10-20%) bothering get tested first place; want wait day car summer sitting parking lot, plus they're worried cost, worried giving name address state, worried knowing truth themselves. Plus even saying yourself; people choosing choosing get tested based various human behaviors, whether that's fear (rational not) external pressures families, employers etc. Trump went TV told everyone watches Fox News ""go get tested"" think would affect numbers following day? minute things affecting people day day choose go get tested not. 

So let's look numbers again, first SC's ""test positivity rate"", 7-day moving average currently 16.5%, back March peaked 27.2% (which means daily rates much higher that? discrepancy? everything better March them? say enough testing proving point mine? LOL! See bullshit metric.

The fact given single number (21%) even moving average (16.5%) cannot much alone; need know going not, rate change happening, external factors caused adjust demographics people getting tested draw conclusions it. true conclusion ""we're testing enough"" already 10-20% infected people getting tested well going now? 

source: want give award can't please accept gratitude instead 🙏 Relevancy comes first Well lot reasons number high. Dense population, major outbreaks elderly homes, transition country Europe count every suspicious death covid19 case. yes numbers high look countries like Germany Danemark numbers barely risen since schools reopened (or never closed) What's situation now? didn’t respond entire reasoning.

NYC SEE HOSPITALS FULL EVEN HEIGHT CRISIS. highest population density ANYWHERE America, also faced peak proper treatments, safety precautions, serious lockdown imposed people.

Now tell me: now, JULY, Florida worried all? much better spot NYC NYC never worried room patients. saying HIV basically accepting fault without accepting fault? hell rushed reopening them? I'm dismissing trades all. I'm saying anyone suited trades, sales, entrepreneurship fucked go college. companies finally apprenticeships decades, I'm glad hear it. So, slavery?!

If forcing work maintain boat keeping permitted disembark, refusing pay anything slavery? Sadly many parents need wake call trully know priorities are. almost died pneumonia age 6. month hospital many month long recovery home parents everything never let happen again. sounds cold people die every day many things. thing dead don’t suffer consequences. Locking people removing ability afford food shelter trying ‘wait out’ isn’t going cut it. offer real solution problem people get really fucking desperate. everyone disagrees Karen, they’re people worried survival. Living leave people financial consequences follow rest lives. 

Presenting edge case like people isn’t sway them. extrovert sort stuff infuriates me. like home much, great, stay home time!! one making go out!!!! time!!!!!!!! hell praising leadership felt highly let caved easily. Should’ve taken hardline like Michigan. It’s California knows got backing majority. article people going doctors appointments elective surgeries. got vaccine? Really? Also pretty much know quarantine unlike longer incubation periods covid toddler smarter mature her. Casuistry courtrooms really hope whatever made angry gets better. can't understand people try claim can't wear mask breathing issues medical reasons. mom COPD breathes fine mask, plus wore/wears whenever pollen bad, since lessens chance asthma attack. 

Any health reason, probably good idea outside pandemic. people claim health reasons actually true health issues would keep wearing masks. I’m doctor. can’t think single reason someone well enough shopping well enough wear mask. Anxiety? Take Xanax shut up. Allergic material? Find another mask. Respiratory issues? shopping. delivery curbside alone. That's right, they're testing tens thousands right phased approach. vaccine years making, nothing rushed. Chalk always struck pretty unfriendly environment viruses/bacteria, never really worried communal chalk previously...is case? Funding government, like many countries. paid exactly 0 education. cheaper feed house people ship 110+ days pay 2 week hotel stay? 

Conditions bad Polish cruise ship worker threw sea get fucking boat. That's how.

They boat, running boat makes water electricity dumps waste. probably fed worse prison food point, doubt law prevent international waters.

In short, cheaper neglecting needs free poor people recourse.

If keeps i'd frankly expect GD mutiny. Looks like racism problem solve itself, maybe since mortality rate remains 1%, good point, despite downvotes. understand backlash LA SD lot cases yet included, really would make sense main number reported per capita trying state-by-state comparison. feels like clickbait otherwise. Look wife's instagram. bullshit God talk. Seems like stupid prayers help all. Maybe she'll realise retarded god exist. else would let die even though prayed hard. STUPID RELIGIOUS IDIOTS Spokane going triple digits soon. hit 98 new cases single day today. steadily going higher numbers almost everyday. still people refuse wear masks. flu killed brother two years ago. current best estimate CDC COVID symptomatic case fatality 50 one half one percent

What’s point? Considering contagious is, many people infected right now, that’s hell lot people dying absolutely miserable death. Sounds like rational thing afraid of. Bingo. Good old America. also right option go bar music venue beach. also right business man able continue business without breaking laws violations preventive measures. problem wearing mask even border line that’s body. We’re told can’t virus 0.04% death rate people 65. govt taking advantage lot people falling can't nice things. guess bars going need shut learn properly. miss socially distanced patio beer takes. stay. Even vaccine going away. could prevent seriousness 50% take it... since half population wont take disease change 75% Americans.  Wait? say hit record 27th day? say 27th day *this year* since they're counting March.

That's gotta intentional. Great. Well coronavirus doesn’t 50% mortality rate that’s bullshit. first ones line benefits sick, unemployed, can't afford sports school thing handed scream want others things. Aunt died brain cancer nurses hospital ended allowing husband kids in, well dad (her brother) mother. We’d isolated two months time consider lucky able her. Although actual hospital visits suspended months died. Ramifications virus everything insane always new pandemic around corner, always be. thing usually years apart sometimes even least 100 years apart. That's way history works.

The Plague hit once.. returned 600 years later hit harder. Milleneals promised inherit world glory 2009 crash proved otherise. promised us isolated event recession would end things would better ever. lied. things worse ever decade after. old tricks politicians lies. 

Gen Z slight advantage know sure trust establishment. wont fall tricks mistakes milleneals. know...Detroit nah. Miami, Vegas, Atlanta? Absolutely! ""The 27-year-old former flight attendant Equinox trainer""... yeah. Can't quite come drag name plays Corona Mary. Help y'all. Nothing lines well. look one place maybe come something, national level like switch. switch lines exactly protests. got see Waitress. incredible. loss. Especially wife little boy. One main problems heater skelter process shutdowns implemented well rescinded. Arbitrary dates concern making sure guidelines met upon reopening, another 2-4 weeks would less emotional toll roller coaster going now. job back open little month shutting back due steady increase cases, imagine back business September way things going. lot evidence responsible management citizens government effective getting control. example Germany 239 new reported cases today, quarter US population fit area roughly size Montana. downplaying roles necessary players control following expert advice, it’s prime example things right. combination testing, social distancing, contact tracing mandated face coverings public viable approach vaccines cleared general public, really minor inconvenience best. agree indefinite lockdowns plausible, people lackadaisical people’s safety, it’s perhaps way slow things down. won’t fill up?

You believe magic, congratulations. I've always referred SKELETOR Thank positivity encouragement. meant I'm done life. diffucult time parent. sincerely hope recover. always hear virus permanently fuck life manner ways, nobody talks vaccine also permanently fuck life manner ways. 

Can ask anyone get frontline H1N1 vaccine narcolepsy permanent behavior changes. Dont talk Pneumonia develops flu also easily cause permanent damage lungs. 

It’s isn’t serious, it’s people sudden forgotten thousands risks accept daily basis. 75 underlying conditions spin roulette barrel once.  
My household ranges 1-3 shots. should, lot places back maskless asshole instead. FREEDOM! agree. spent nearly 20 years paying back student loans take order complete degree undegreed self hit wall employment. Every place applied pleased experience, would say, ""We hire degreed professionals."" 

Where work now, we'll hire entry-level without degree there's departmental policy can't get promoted without degree.

Experience needs count something again, blaming particular myopia universities another example us covering corporate asses deflecting blame. want college costs go down, reduce demand. #1 activity stay safe.... Stay fuck inside RemindMe! 14 days ""wave 2"" source unknown long term effects? feel like you’re saying people definitely fact, they’re long term, don’t know exist yet. I'm definitely wearing mask home. It’s debilitating. rough cold knock week, maybe you’re lucky it’ll couple days sniffy nose sore throat, know one curl blanket hot drink watch TV.

Influenza doesn’t that, get flu you’re bedridden, everything hurts. get bad enough, it’ll kill you.

I hate comparisons coronavirus, it’s completely different virus - presents differently, incubates differently, treated differently. Also, coronavirus doesn’t vaccine - seems lost (non-antivaxxer) people seem think coronavirus big deal flu big deal. least flu preventable injection. catch coronavirus, better hope you’re one lucky ones - chances are, you’re not, you’ll probably bad time might die along 100,000 Americans.

If make shit hope never forget many people willingly put us harm’s way didn’t believe big deal. Neither deserve let quietly drift distant memory - lives worth uninformed feelings, deserve shamed forever, least learn wrong were. can't handle taking blame it. part saving face aspect culture. many people missing limbs due COVID-19? titel post that's sure XD death! Neither presidential candidate supports Medicare all. fact Joe Biden openly stated he'd veto came desk. They're disgusting I'm Sydney we've looking excuse 101 years.....nah......good luck Vic. really hope get control. say New York getting better now? excuses... States reporting - Cali 6 deaths today according Worldmeter. Clearly best wait making post - guess folk want \*good\* news get regardless context. I'm american really know that. knew jobs particularly dangerous ones. think either really right either (incentivizing jailing people paying market wage) still live (in US). Cops give citation wearing one indoors public place. they're spring break, caring testing mean decline 1. said don’t wear masks blatantly obvious shortwave happening hospitals needed them.
2. ever said unlikely transfer human animal people worried pets. extremely obvious transferring human human. People already anxiety depression probably feeling much worse Hahaha read incorrect things.

It ridiculous think class full students one teacher going get better instruction student one one optimized course ware presenting adapting student measuring reviewing based students progress. one hits home reason. Feels like I’ve following ‘story’ since seemingly beginning. RIP  Damn, guess blockages started. feel like type person would hate trapped talking party idea expensive rent tuxedo shapeshifts? seem going backwards open door retrieve copy FFVIIR UPS delivery driver dropped off. door covered spiderwebs could hear torn apart. Death rate 3%. 3m confirmed cases, count really low, testing limited 1/3 people don’t show symptoms. Probably closer 10-15 million cases know I'm using smart phone....I could well using computer friends house. think pretty smart move recuse sound like idiot  6 days? Wow smh ur absolutley right. Yea that's probably weekend effect, although look 7 day averages states: Texas, Florida, Arizona, California look like slope leveling off, even declining somewhat case Arizona California. I'm hopeful next week might start downward trend cases areas. virus might buring out. holiday weekend. like Abbot used brag lowest numbers ever! Always Sunday/Monday tho tests naturally lower due weekend reporting. Yeah think anyone needs listening Dick Dearlove. Idiots like reason everything locked  Can't believe I'm quoting him, paraphrase Doug Ford, ""all takes one person 125"". come contact others, spread family, yada yada. irresponsible reprehensible. would fairly easy practice social distancing schools far faculty concerned. someone explain words black latino capitalized articles publications now, white not? always like it?  ""It's old people going die anyway"" said economic pain and surge cases Parson lifted his stay-at-home order May proof orders work, told reporter mandating masks would violate people's rights ""free country."" 

""It's opinion, think flu like rest them,"" Bartosh continued. ""We tried quarantining, staying home obviously work. think going run course."" 



We learned literally NOTHING. know lag new case death, right? People don’t die covid day get mostly. Domestic cases reduced 50% compared yesterday! strict. love it.  death rate [is ! How’s working all? Oh okay, I'll throw masks away then. No, that’s it. You’re racist call black people “monkey” comment history wanted “make point” BLM rioters, knowing peaceful protesters rioting that’s dog whistle. fun trolling bye :) Agree! put policies place, aren’t followed meaningless. I’m mindset healthcare taking extremely seriously perhaps need get another field employment aren’t paying attention international medical crisis. Unfortunately, yes. dad believes bullcrap too. Yeah unfortunately take us them. Campus security.

Let people campus text email reports anonymously, like arenas stadiums have. People's phones cameras. 

I'm betting 5-10% class problem texting campus police photos locations people wearing masks. Hell point they've either gone, gone long time ago This! dentist *dentist* happy tell protocols, also let people one time required wear PPE they’re actively mouth. Also made temperature check door.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* problem. become apparent added context that. Even flu kills people. hate people say flu. flu kills too. month anti police protests stores busting people masks? would go well. Haha. don’t think Senate going get anything meaningful done time prevent depression, let alone save trouser industry.

Maybe another company buy assets trademark. We’ll check back months. Remember hydroxychloroquine? Authorized emergency use pulled back couple months later. people risk dying hospital. bar higher vaccine. might happen fall emergence use authorization, FDA approval. would phase three trials complete. Nothing months lockdown great democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker put on.  really got close loophole. someone BC, already frustrating enough AB people coming province, fact Americans coming country absolutely infuriating. death wish discount. Seriously, think prices low. testing. yup Considering they're always getting stabbed back people they're voting for, even call conspiracy theorists.

More like nut jobs. Here's graph delayed death reports Florida: goes show addition 125 people stupid owner! said similar thing one neighbors long ago. Gov. Abbott announced going reopen Texas. told reason we're shut continue so, solely protect ourselves, we're trying help protect vulnerable. Insisting life returning normal incredibly selfish, especially people calling they're ""going stir crazy"" mundane reasons.

Her husband yelled vulnerable could stay lockdown make life would easier rest us.

So told steps eugenics Nazism. I'm fairly certain know eugenics were, guess thought calling Nazi, too.

We spoken since. I'm fucking wrong sorry it, either. hope throw book them. strong message sent serious consequences reckless endangerment this. inequity really right word virus? Doesn’t equity usually mean justice? mask nothing treating got it, severe be, long take recover, mortality rate. it, died it. mask stopped part conversation tested positive. 

Everybody's talking mask, **nobody's** talking long-term plan. American exceptionalism way life here. Rules? others. place adds Red Bull Aperol Spritz deserves shut down. Grocery stores stay open Patients typically get 'bedsores' hospitals unless sub standard care. turn patients frequently prevent pressure injuries, especially ICU. patients I've seen pressure injuries typically come nursing homes bad reputations understaffing/overworking employees. Yep. Finally someone speaking sense. Quite frankly I'm gonna fucking outraged got another semester online college. Cuomo count probables deaths tally - Worldmeter using probables NY City reports daily. Really? Again, know me, need tell world much spend mobile data, assure significantly cheaper quoted. And, what? using smartphone writing this? clearly afford mobile data *and* gym membership. showing superiority complex online, I'm done. always money grab. Pandemic pandemic. That's strictly true.

COVID-19 survives hard surfaces 3 days. too. fine Hygiene quite poor UK. Let’s hope people manage stay safe ability preclude consciousness, living animals logically possess -your anthropocentric view conflicts understand consciousness. 

I said nothing consciousness, cognition, consequently make claim perspective consciousness might conflict anthropocentric excuses carnism ok excuses used Jefferson's time justify slavery

Indeed, suppose could make claim. fundamental difference, however, Jefferson *wrong* African inferiority *right* human superiority.

Let ask you, *necessarily* wrong us eat another animal species fundamental survival tool? wrong cats it? obligated abandon food chain we're top it? *in* food chain, doubt would proposed moral wrong- would busy competing survival. cows position eat humans, think would inevitably do?

Do believe carnivorous animals behaving slaves legal right refuse deeply muddy things.

No kidding. Also consideration minor legally consider unable give consent, definitionally rape.  Ok pointed shes hypocrite completely different way, thanks!!


You're right bud, trump makes okay someone else do, good luck clunking around 3rd grade logic 👌 You’re forgetting part Florida schools start even earlier. Florida educator, return work three weeks pre-preplanning (July 27-31). Regular preplanning following week (August 3-7). Kids come back August 10th. 3-4 weeks adults, 5 weeks kids. bad, read ""who looks like Freddy prinze jr"" Singapore British colony. what? everyone doesn’t Beijinger mindset westerner? 

It’s exactly attitude don’t fit others. understand “western attitude” Asian country myself. doesn’t mean India, Thailand Singapore reflect attitude. Regardless colonized decades ago. 

Lots Chinese also study abroad. call westerners country? 

Following laws sacrifice. It’s duty responsible citizen. sacrifice something beyond, already supposed do. 

Do terrorists commit sacrifice killing someone leaving someone alive? No. default position don’t kill anyone. default position follow laws responsible citizen. 

We shouldn’t praise follow laws home travel. shouldn’t traveling right anyway. 

I accused bigotry low expectations. mind it’s sacrifice responsible citizens anyway do. sacrifice drive properly road? recycle trash? Even countries people don’t follow laws, one think following laws everyone else favor making sacrifices. That's lot consecutive winning. much winning Dude, congrats! hope job treats well. Also important keep perspective even US purchased every single unit, we're still looking 3-4 years get everyone. Yes, yes dont agree must racist. Louder people back happen ??? Trump said control understand What's solution food then. Also everything closed cause mental health epidemic. 2 + nothing = 2? must talking site asks unblock ads read article. pause ad blocker page temporarily read article. link one top tier newspapers India. Check  dont want Bill Gates access thoughts. 5G need installed thru covid-19 vaccine!!! Lol. Beauty. time truth 20% news stretched farther runtime Chapter 2 now? antibody tests yet see you’ve it? worked someone crazy cough(for weeks), loss taste, doctors told came day later would died blood looked like sludge. (He’s overweight) back February told flu+strep even though didn’t test “lost paperwork” lowered bill lol anyway I’d like know I’ve exposed already. version ""The Last Ship"" occurs. voting I’m gloomer 🤷🏻‍♀️oh Reddit claim ""peaceful protest"". Ok, pull liquor license months then. Go ahead protest. Seriously. It’s unfortunately even divide we’re going keep destroying cities harming neighbors. freaking virus- unite us. It’s embarrassing. ""Just wait election. disappeared entire world day after! watch!! contact tracing show actions killed anyone, involuntary manslaughter...or going let reopen bar 30 days continue lives nothing happened?! oxygen levels got low resort something called ECMO, high incidence blood clots used last resort. clot blocked major artery leg, wasn’t caught time save leg. 😔 run course. probably last 10 years (or more).

Wear mask, clean hands, unnecessary contact.... that's it. come vaccine last longer antibodies (9 weeks so) may chance.

Soooo many Facebook friends meeting people weekend. One friends family drove (avoided air travel) family gathering. apparently that's a-okay according them. grandma gathering. There's absolutely lot undercounting going on, even according sources listed pneumonia deaths excess deaths also going even accounting lag reporting.  [""Get Make permanent people take seriously. It’s fucking national/global health crisis Right, experts listening answers. actually know much all, would CDC monitor ordinary cases people hospitalized flu? thinking maybe hospitals would misidentify flu CDC non wiser? completely unavailable general public U.S. course help things. obvious anyone. matter point? large portion population taking serious protesting, shopping frivolous things, eating out, going bars, house parties, etc. need people change behavior economy ruined lives lost. google gave keep masks next time get cold keep yourself! already wearing mask distancing woke up. I’m definitely going outside week much last week. Geez. 
Earlier tonight wife said me, “Remember telling friend (a former Rockette) Broadway friend who’s Broadway husband got COVID coma leg amputated? died.” I’m like couple degrees away didn’t realize known open Reddit realize it’s guy. 
:( stop point blame people put effort containing thing. opinion never really ""Trump"" issue outside fact sounds like fucking idiot talks anything related pandemic. field expertise---he sat shut fuck let CDC take charge----like supposed do. Trump turned responsibilities states leaderships, great thing. Unfortunately found state leaders bunch idiots looking corners round room.

Please keep incestuous obese fucks country ""calm"" waves, though waves stack top presents serious concerns next month on. 

The reason we're seeing reduction deaths treatments help slow progress dieases currently capacity provide adequate palliative care. cities start seeing hospital strain, expect deaths places rise concurrently. Learn knowledge virus.  resorted insults. gladly still talk terrible homeschooling maybe privileged day. clear!!!! Would say car rentals cheap relative food? understand. Here, taking uber work would cost much extremely expensive restaurant dinner. Car prices accordingly.

Then again, buses extremely (80%) subsidized, greatly distorts prices. believe distorting subsides buses may one reasons economic chaos country. make Americans pay Right move. Though Australia trashes China lot, learn lot China’s experience. Nah, we're good Kiwis Aussies. :/ Clorox wipes, gowns?  those? hard manufacture? Look Fauci said weren’t enough needles even consider ready. whatever. hate adults little kid “it’s going okay isn’t mommy” attitude. isn’t going okay. all. People going eating brains. reality “negative” bad. It’s going happen anyway. You...know stuff online nowadays, right? Like bunch huge medical biller/insurance company virtual databases?? sad I've seen news cameras going hospitals Texas Arizona, talking doctors say turn people away 3 beds left, chose gets them. comments? ""Fake news"" etc. hate people. I’m 100% ok culture adapting regular mask usage I’m exactly sure would celebrate burning masks. 

We can’t let think need times crisis. help reduce spread things like normal flu colds. helps people. saying everyone needs wear one forever make normal wear mask go work sniffles. People think like Beijingers Westerners?
First all, mistake media's terminology Western media, say anyone think like Beijinger Westerner.
The fact media, claiming neutrality, position, least position country in.
It's comfortable attitude, hate term ""Mass exodus"".

There two kinds Chinese China.
One mainland China dictatorial, backward, corrupt incompetent, go hell, China declines able integrate foreign world. Chinese. call people ""High Chinese"" ""Bananas"".
The people forgotten Chinese, generic term call them, limit nationality, long view China objective neutrality.

As said earlier, Beijing never made mandatory citizens able travel, mandatory go 7-day negative nucleic acid certificate notice.
But sacrifice many even though got negative nucleic acid certificate, leave city, knowing Beijing tested 10 million people yesterday, half total population, waited Beijing completely unsealed low-risk areas leaving city.
I've said once, confused? Public highschool school teacher Oregon. current plan cohort system students stay classroom day half time distance learning home. like days half students attend school B days half attend. Also lunches served bags eaten cohort classroom. Buses doubled allow social distancing I'm really sure possible. student gets positive case whole cohort goes quarantine two weeks. seems like teachers expected attend school person 4 days week. plan safe possible obviously distance learning safer. Teaching person online challenging though. Also parents get much break kids home 2-3 weekdays. last thing read wife explaining current state, didn’t seem like things going well. don’t know feels shocking, horrible. 

This one 130,000 humans killed due thing. 

I don’t know life going normal again. can’t imagine many families impacted, many people going left behind. 

He doesn’t suffer anymore. Median time test death 12 days. Median means 12 days half deaths expect folks got tests day would happened. Gambled people’s lives* Huhwat thought Canadians perfect ""We lockdown virus mostly spread, reopened virus went nuts. proves lockdown work.""

A prime example Missouri public education system. I'm gutted too. praying pull despite horrible complications. May memory blessing. Amen! Everyone stay home! side plague inc tell virus gonna annoyed. want Asian Americans allies cause want feel alienated cause? want feel alienated, excellent job right now. Every single state needs bring back lockdown. reopened way early. lot girls Fire Island, unless speaking metaphorically.

Remember last year's flu e-cigarette pneumonia US? “Governor Bill Lee required nursing homes long-term care facilities test residents staff COVID-19 end June. Starting July, nursing homes must test staff week.”

He signed order 6/10. took nearly another month give counties ability mandate masks.

What happening country forcing testing one someone (I think it’s good, but..) civil rights issue asking someone wear piece fucking cloth face is? Via Oxford. started going back gym week ago. extremely spacious, even outdoor area. check temps upon entering must enter mask

Iv ppl family friends families overseas uk reporting symptoms covid 19 November last year. Idk believe dont think chinas fault. Strange china cyber attacks trying get covid info recovering countries though, I’m afraid gf. elementary school teacher. really don’t understand it’s hard school go online. news won’t reported American outlets. It’s simple answer, unfortunately. found correlations though. Blood type (A type correlated worse outcomes), Vitamin deficiency, pre-existing health conditions, age, amount virus get infected with, strain, etc. investigated, it’s certainly complex mix many factors determine badly you’ll experience it. unpredictability virus one scariest aspects it. :( sub around 7 years, says comes search?

There’s much better ways preventing corona spread investing thousands dollars fucking lawn chairs. I’d super bummed case, another remote semester logical safe solution everyone involved.

Many covid patients even risk transmission. course, course.... everyone wear mask many people don’t want wear them, fail see making compulsory isn’t only

Physicians infectious disease specialists encounter flu lot. know pretty well course takes, fun jazz. They’re trained report unusually severe numerous (or both) cases respiratory illness, since flu-like symptoms common precursor lot nasty bugs (smallpox, anthrax, pneumonic plague, name few), certain chemical agents, course looming threat pandemic influenza. 

This kind reporting helps catch stuff early, doesn’t stop outright, helps local officials decide actions take ask help. call kinds things ‘reportable,’ report goes straight state health level acted upon (hopefully). 

This system place since turn 20th century, physician Kansas wrote first Spanish flu cases 1918 precursor CDC. Physicians called CDC 1984 alert new AIDS epidemic, even though hadn’t named nobody knew bad would get. examples things might catch ‘net’ food borne illnesses, measles outbreaks, tularemia, stuff import.

SARS 2 really infectious virus, doesn’t respond tamiflu, wouldn’t come positive influenza test. would almost certainly reportable cluster. There’s certainly possibility US January, nobody published kind data would support (for me, least). don’t MPH, lab manager does, explained :) I’m sure doctors nurses better understanding treatments well. comment touched frailty lives love family , awarded person healthcare hero . exactly hospitalized La, dont think NYC relevant So, stay negative, basically. spread widely China around 2019 Dec 2020 Jan, China knew it, think Xi dared visit several places without special protection period?

Offices seeing normal patient volumes (like office work NC think virus joke) actually overwhelmed put patients hallways, ortho waiting room normally full (maybe 30 people waiting) one 3 people.

For people low risk, seeking care right actually better usual. 

For people high risk, would actually avoid isn’t urgent... unfortunately, outpatient world healthcare isn’t taking seriously. mean, follow precautions distancing, masks, temp checks. trust say immediately tell “you take off, it’s fine” soon come room... means essentially walking room full virus previous patient. don’t want scare anyone it’s something I’ve personally witnessed multiple times now. it’s something like joint pain something serious, think still better high risk people avoid healthcare settings right now. may second event go to. first one weird, around people. second time thrill ""normal"" again.

There good solutions Covid- best shutdown, stimulus, actually think reopening. seeing current administration. time covid shutdown nice mental health amazing protecting people; can't even find slightest bit wanting mental health anymore, deaths horrific put mildly.

I terrified see country look like 2 weeks, month, longer. main silver lining find force change country, hope better. oncoming economic fallout, active attacks healthcare administration, sheer scale deaths subsequent ICU crisis. 

Remember: Trump avoiding ordering thousands billion dollars. THOUSAND. many lives could saved those. give people crumbs, rich trillions, dying little nothing. words describe country's condition. asking that? Simple question: could students dual nationals US license plates legal - tourist - reason Canada? I’m sure Canadian rules license plates. FDA it...? mole isn’t face near nose mouth, could wear mask least. Even it’s slight, there’s protection provided wearer too, though main purpose dampen air outflow getting others. Tell two things:

1. happens ICU capacity full statewide? point coming soon. 

2. simple concept deaths lagging behind hospitalizations lag behind positive diagnoses elude you? People get virus, begin feel symptoms test positive, require hospitalization people die. step takes several weeks. We’ve recently started record positive tests record hospitalizations, figure comes next? suggest actually reread comment...feel free quote may misinterpreted

So hang witj friends people scum working out? STFU fair, pandemic shown businesses make lot money may popular bar may make unemployment. doesn’t mean don’t social responsibility fellow man nobody needs go bar done something important countries learn from,""

""Countries learn others' mistakes."", said nicely. heartbreaking 💔 let guy rest peace days turn yet another gotcha talking point? there's one thing know young people, they're great rationally judging risks here. efiled early April. Got GA refund 3 days. IRS site couldn’t find filing weeks. it’s weeks saying it’s -process. enjoying lockdown? Normal people want world get better they're concerned circumstance. 

If collecting paid it... walking around pretending everything ok, I'm talking mean? Yea mean comorbidities organ systems work. means smoker type bunch requirements. small amount lungs available transplant general, give someone can't even leave ICU. saying need kill bats?

Here telling quote publication

""In brief, frankincense myrrh, two traditional natural medicines, extensive significant pharmacological effects, combination **magically** synergistic effects.""

No credible scientific paper would ever say therapy magical. literally billions dollars government corporate grants flow it.

And exactly put health students faculty, &amp; surrounding community first. Well Trump said nothing GOP running state college system following marching orders. 

It's Florida wear friend teaches. everything planned Fall semester online they've done summer one Gov. DeSantis decided state would open business record numbers new infections everyday damned. 

You proud professors also think they'll win fight.  concerned flu COVID actually kills tons kids every year? sort thing makes news headlines seem trivial. amount money worth life. would year it. hope new orleans florida. live Athens? That's pretty crazy heard good enforcing didn’t answer question. wish widely held opinion general public. However, even widely held opinion STEM graduates. use video warming up. moved America deleted YT music. downloaded using vpn uploaded YT licence free music. 

If anyone knows made it, would love thank them. hard time finding stretch video without long explanations spinkled also looking full body workouts dumbbells. suggestions? Happened WSU too. Evidence it’s fake? I'm doctor sounds like anxiety maybe allergies. new death counts?

Are repeat death counts, death counts without word new including deaths already counted?

The lies really catching activist media cause ""Lone Ranger"" want wear mask. barely fireworks neighborhood right behind mine hardly peep neighborhood. hands quietest 4th I've ever witnessed (and I'm okay that). Along lines? Cities blue. Rural areas red. way went? Yea seem sad all. Must known money coming way soon. still sucked little while, CARES act expiring three weeks job longer. city would choose? real question idiots beach pandemic worry, soon much 2k.

Unless virus suffered mutation made less deadly, CFR way 5% places. means every 50k new infections expect least 2.5k deaths.  sum up, look worldometer too. something breaks ""you MUST go 4 year liberal arts college regardless cost"" ""colleges place acquire useful skills"" 

Why blaming colleges universities this, though? corporate America hire anyone without college degree, goes back least early '90s. 

If one could get decent job career track without degree (other trades, sales, entrepreneurship), would pressure anyone go college unless needed specific degree (such Engineering Accounting) really wanted go. likely not. People hit hard Wuhan showing good recovery six month mark, including healing damage lung's interstitial tissues. cells destroyed virus take roughly six months regenerate, sometimes longer people depending severity, age, genetics. damage permanent individuals, know exactly rare least year now. suspected case! area December/January. went work identified China. think around since least November 2019. China country study trend identify it. Whereas area saying ""you viral pneumonia head cold"" wondering EVERYFUCKINGBODY getting thing. Australian here. heard news morning despite widespread unemployment, we're course perform way average economically compared developed economies. 

We're reopening safely. definitely hiccups ultimately, responsible approach ability follow rules going mean businesses begin recover sustainably. 

I idea business supposed plan future US moment. quite terrible spectacle. Mass sacrifice altar economy legitimate policy. months everything getting better looking forward NFL even fans. I'm worried family, friends myself. know girl went surgery.

She got covid hospital. Never left it. died 25. orange gets re-elected, world boned. sinking feeling would, let's cross fingers till 2025. weird lol. It’s always nice chill watch Netflix really missed hiking getting friends weeks. lawyer, reasonable accommodation means someone shopping curb pickup etc. let someone store without mask found Saddam's WMD, yet? I'm sorry, know feel. 5 year old supposed starting kindergarten year social loves kids. still even really know school district planned yet announced.  Even 2 year old asking zoo, dinner, etc. absolutely sucks kids. Dude, world improve people feel sad it.

It's OK enjoying lockdown personal level working make things better encouraging local federal leaders better get shitshow sooner rather later. Fuck 😭 Ooofff. Try explain anyone Arizona. sick experiment really liking part of. state seriously failed us. wonder noticable jump flu deaths worldwide. case, “**direct threat**” exception ADA disability poses threat others’ safety need accommodated.

It hasn’t litigated, 100% certain ADA doesn’t allow idiots refuse wear face masks. remindme! 2 weeks deaths age bracket strikingly continuous logarithmic curve, means while, yes, much higher chance dying 65 45 much higher 45 25, age groups risk curve. hit 65 suddenly new vulnerability, growing poorly defended (and diseases) decades. need Comfort sandcrawler AZ.   Darwin Awards contestants begin collecting prizes. feel much better Karens work deal with, “what weekend?”, comments life, plus lost weight quit smoking weed. It’s amazing! German friend wants visit October.

Way go Georgia Tech!!! Lives matter money. Say loud, say proud! No! Changing release date Tenet, reopening schools, holding conventions...it's wishful thinking! if! Masks protect others. go out, wearing mask. certain masks actually protect you. There’s much misinformation there. I'm retired social hobbies, tbh really noticed much difference, apart two daughters schooling home while. they're back school I'm I've done couple years. give insight this? recommend reading topic? parents threw front computer Windows 3.1 fucked off.

As result never able relate peers, found really difficult find footing society. feel like I've raising 30 years.

Rest peace. hope get there. never good feeling gym. home, long used warm videos, mind would jump gym mode. Good luck. wish, Mr Trump! trust WHO? Compared many first world countries, U.S. stimulus package fucking joke. money went corporations ended laying employees anyway. doctor told stay home 7 days. stayed home 8 feel sick already beach.

Although clearly stupid decision rest us, break laws doctor told do.  issue we're July I'm trying lump rural areas together. one area practically public schools, Christian Catholic schools. worked unit 50% nursing staff believes form quakery other. hospital setting encountered essentially encountering. 

You also working trauma center, demands higher level skillsets, helps weed nurses prone call ""magical thinking"". rare think. Look demographic data COVID-19 deaths CDC. numbers incredibly continuous 20 70, logarithmic progression. means age correlated death, like hit 65 suddenly at-risk. risk increases age. fortunate still job, work home experience going every day. think I'd hard time focusing home, also believe stress levels would much lower. can’t believe bars opening now. epidemiologists said it’ll least year bars make sense. Particularly light Florida Arizona exploding. Florida's cases started massively spiking. Give 2 weeks month see escalating. 

People love pull nursing home card without even knowing they're talking about, shed light that, since work nursing home.

The bill stated resident tested positive, come back nursing home nursing home capable room quarantine residents need hospitalized (ie ventilator).

Nursing homes hit hard way bill enacted. bill enacted around 20 confirmed 50 quarantine showing symptoms. literally evidence bill actually caused deaths.

Also social media play-if isnt thumbs picture progress passed along, probably pretty bleak there. patients cold give finger knew still Guardian British Newspaper, Americans stopped British people told 1776 could talking masks. Wear them. pay 30K/yr tuition, pay diploma grants right work.

Basically paying permit work, that's gatekeeping finest. probably free. government, insurance companies, everyone involved make money corona goes away Clots possible ECMO, I'd guess likely lost leg due complications ecmo circuit (very large catheter, lead ischemia leg).

Hockey goalies known lose 5-10lbs per game. memory serves right, Dominik Hasek (Buffalo Sabres) IV's quadruple-overtime game.

*Swine flu enters chat* anyone gofundme let know. see would want enforce law. sounds like dangerous territory government overreach. stats come out, starting see covid lethal originally thought was. CDC admitted entering unconfirmed covid deaths total death toll. virus also seems contagious mask anyway. virologists labs wear full body suits protection. Whether masks required law, pretty much see people wearing everywhere everyone seems still getting infected. 

The virus seems killing unhealthy people. study made country (can't remember which) showed 96% people died virus vitamin deficiency. sure getting attention. feel though data could huge breakthrough. saw similar studies, kind point unhealthy people getting killed virus. fight virus ways, best way seems personal health nutrition. approach stop way covid too. 

Like said, pretty much see everyone wearing masks everywhere anyway. see need make people submit hands government. virus seems contagious seems like conversation shift ""how stop spread"" ""how stop deaths"". opinion. Harris Dallas county cases report deaths today. backlog. Excuse me, what? That's it, need go war damn Neanderthals. impossible safely test matter months. one, don’t test pregnant women kids, even phase 3. Even polio vaccine took years. Better rush get right first time. Case point what’s happening US. even extra month shutdown, would much better way recovery. Millennials 30's. agree thanks thoughtful conversation. /r/confidentlyincorrect smart Frat row though.

/s joke literally stage 1, 2, 3 California seemingly occured concurrent weeks Regardless think helping. virus run course, small speed bumps masks, even lockdowns archives little anything. net results end day nothing vs everything think around equal, difference getting quickly prolonging it.
Most people diffcult time fact think control, nope God forbid someone brings positive note instead fear mongering 24/7. Scares too, easily imagine cornered Trump administration starting something nasty South China Sea. scares girlfriend works hospital restaurant scared give me. already extremely high blood clotting factor. Phlebotomist hate blood clots fast wasted multiple tubes trying draw. Hahah amazing! think matters Simpsons predicts though. quite hospitals actually treating covid patients hyperbaric oxygen chambers! sure crossover medications though. Actually hear professionals calling epithelial disease. happens blood vessels rich epithelial tissue. virus also attack many places body. Thank everyone. You’re likely right call tomorrow learn schedule appointment. I’m actually remembering visited dentist early March (seems like ages ago) COVID fully exposed states probably risky (maybe even more). Thank calming nerves! know xi went wuhan march. missed point said 1-2 year supply everything. includes food, water, fuel generator.

That said, fully expect donate almost supplies (soon). reality COVID taken seriously possible reduce numbers deaths, amount people surviving well infection rates clearly show going break infrastructure.

Far that, infection rates grow, reaction increases. Shut non-essential places occur, masks become mandated, etc... like people go willing wear masks, instantly willing show work. isn’t anything do.

Yes, is. Reduce eliminate risks, you, others. running PCR?

We are, unfortunately test small batch time. 

In past, adequate, aren’t large hospital, machine could handle volume room spare. 

But running full batches one other, slowing techs down. QC also becomes problematic going balls wall 24 hours day machine. 

I’m PA bachelors CLS Hard reality swallow everybody wearing least cloth mask even inside home  actually replaced chalk gym liquid chalk contains alcohol sanitizing hands. People severe sepsis semi-regularly lose limbs.  company figured long time ago, seems decided important micromanage office. Tbf think inhaler really helped, inhaled steroid (a regular med) probably helped inflammation too. main goal fight time knew biggest illness causers (inflammation fluid build up), support immune system.

Also, remember prone position (laying face down) shown help lot - that's one techniques doctors found helps oxygenation I’m guessing places aren’t people exhaling heavily, dripping bodily fluids, potentially practicing good hygiene (wiping equipment weights) inside air conditioned room fans... gen Alpha gen Beta. awarded fellow important efforts correct poor grammar. Nobody deserves that's fucked people taking seriously. could huge numbers high. Definitely could change narrative pandemic people got vaccinated kill nearly many. lot people asymptomatic flu think vaccine pointless cause never get it, meanwhile spread people die. bad! Kudos Guinness Father Ted. Thank everyone. You’re likely right call tomorrow learn schedule appointment. I’m actually remembering visited dentist early March (seems like ages ago) COVID fully exposed states probably risky (maybe even more). Thank calming nerves!

Even quote numbers they, like always, leave actual covid patients, I'm talking ones truly sick. Know what's hospitals % wise here, elective surgeries, car accidents, healthy issues etc (heart surgeries etc).... everything like normal

Reminds Delray got reported full Covid ventilators used, text uncle whose ER physician even remotley true accurate. USA like giant corporation hire fulltime provide medical insurance.

It's Walmart plutocracy, basically.

So, Walmart. Yeah really understand downvotes posts subject. honestly think significant number anti-mask videos comparable countries there, okay then. got me, lol. seen someone must stashing away. confirm. Agency CNA typing RV. Hospitalizations Deaths seem even better indicator percent positive. Probably more-so hospitalizations deaths lag further. Back NY 10,000 cases 693 deaths day severely sick states get tested. we're able test mildly symptomatic close contacts. also better idea symptoms look for. I'm saying get worse point, US \~30,000 positive day lot worse \~50,000 per day. could completely change week though. Excuse me? perfectly clear referenced 3 worlds NATO Soviet context. inability comprehend you, me. mean hospitals starting fill up. whole point flattening curve prevent that... we’re seeing projected happen LA Houston know within next weeks. Death isn’t complication COVID. It’s got relatively low death rate even vulnerable populations hospital stay COVID patient fairly long... 

Essentially I’m saying going economic crisis matter what? We’ve seen unmitigated spread healthcare system NYC, Italy, etc. overwhelmed services get. potentially 5 situations brewing country right now, can’t divert resources 5 different areas effectively don’t see economic harm prevented without lockdown.  Whoms’t this? Hah. true Chicago. One simply mess CPS system. care Central Park 5 put full page ad paper calling death even though debunked suspect confessed DNA matched found scene, last year said apologize comments. 

He care ""truther"" debunked.

He care this.  Hey! hospitals would go something happened! lucky roommate got sick recently. Looks like COVID, know results ten days. I'm terrified. set strict quarantine procedures also shared blunt stuff past week might fucked. I'm immunocompromised. 

It's fucking stupid. quarantined since March went ""everything's fine reopen America"" propoganda got friend group held barbecue went to. outside exposure. might get sick, could suffer permanent damage effects, fucking barbecue. I'm even pissed much whole situation. I'm even pissed, I'm scared. 

Fuck. FUCK showed coronavirus who's boss! tough ya..!  Karen knows bounds, home Target, shabby chic decor ""higher end"" retail. That's sooo racist /s Pence, Kushner, anyone take responsibility states' leaders' actions? Ive symotoms since mid March. Theres alot media talking about. cough fever thing. never cough point

 Currently fourth wave. 3 different hospitals total 11 ER visits tried telling anxiety clue.

First wave sick feeling. GI issues, fever, SOB, Aterrible muscle aches. Lasted 2 weeks.

Felt better week

Sexond wave HORRIBLE chest/heart pains SOB, stabbing pains around body. Lasted 3 weeks

Felt better week 2.

Third wave heart palpitations strange pressure chest bad acid reflux. Lasted 2 weeks

Felt better around 4 weeks so. Really thought beat it.

Currently wave #4. palpitations, easily get exhausted, heart races random times even sleep. Cardiologist told heart monitor showed 150 beats per minute sleeping one night. Exactly this. grandma AZ, admitte hospital testing positive Covid19, also found bacterial pneumonia, died yesterday, everyone saying “had several problems”. Bull-Fucking-shit, Arizona. bacterial pneumonia, you’d given antibiotics kept observation. Instead, sent covid designated hospice oxygen plummeted, made comfortable died. Like tomato/lycopene thing years ago. Remember started adding lycopene vitamins while? OK google:

 sneak Canada Okay likely lag then? think started “Atlantic bubble” last week? say hear drivers, understand invisible corporate uber easily fuck up. I'd believe would say something like that. love Carl Sagan. 

If opening schools going disaster (which be) need postpone it. education gotten later, life lost cannot. Children gone greater social damaging, since dawn man, missing school. like we're actively trying make things worse. first time entire life genuinely angry news. submission removed because

Ok depends define high. high enough morgue trucks etc. conspiracy would empty hopsitals nurses doctors nothing pretending are.   choice.

Hospitals filling up. Plenty mental distancing.

That's freedumb you. Oh sucks, really interesting well worth watching, use free VPN watch :) going wait universal healthcare countries coronavirus control introduce it.  governments far measured paying it, less political pressures rush something out.  4 weeks ago half reddit saying ""just wait 2 weeks surge"" half said ""bullshit, stop fear mongering, we've won!!"" 

Now half reddit saying ""yes there's surge deaths down, stop fear mongering"" half saying ""just wait 2 weeks""

I side wait two weekers. Hospital beds already running out. serious shit go down. Goodbye America. mean say city.


... clearly saying save face. That’s main problem. problem hospitals overwhelmed time people could lived hospitalized die, people needed medication die, people get sepsis treatable conditions die. cuomo prevented happening. DickSantis encouraging it. vaccine little running bloodwork pregnant didn’t show up! I’m 30 said years got vaccine didn’t “stick” seen quite women age issue. gave gave birth. said well it’s either body doesn’t process it. Praying did!  Indoors. Florida Florida. 3 percent what? exactly works bud. extremes respecting one's elders, way pick extreme example. America, hedonic pursuits loss one's culture seems fairly commonplace.  Maybe empathy understanding affect/effect might little helpful. fair, lot parts US right across line poorly. Mask compliance pretty good New England. Cases way down. trend looks like European country. don’t even know anymore. lucky working home grocery delivery options, every time make someone deliver groceries that’s exposing them. I’m high-risk it’s like grow food....in state like this, right thing protect killing people. It’s fucked up. point honestly can't make head tails data especially comes methods prevention work (except total isolation) relative seriousness disease itself. numbers place untrustworthy.

The one thing know plaque worried going first heard although might cause considerable early increase deaths several hundred thousand.

But black Plaque super contagious Ebola.

In way makes decisions much harder. Nice try China lmfao can't honestly believe that? holy shit await response We’re probably good two years since election October. Cape Coral area? That’s funny cause live Houston hear shit, lol. know there's temptation ride political angle this. saw heard, seems like one individual's mental health crisis. overtaken Texas today number COVID-19 cases probably surpass California 10 - 12days. expect end July, even cases New York.

Well done Governor DeSantis. Reminder Disney college kids housed Disney crowded dorm-like buildings. opinion, less risks inside park, living conditions outside park. Oh, $$$$, likely need far fewer employees right Thank saying that. really helps lot.  ""establishment"" fear young people, vote large numbers. Ok dude passing 6 week old article current. Got quote Dead Sea scrolls share next? passage New Testament maybe? 6 weeks lifetime right now, obviously. Way paste time, but, yes. Meanwhile Michigan, county gone medium risk high risk. Joy. Hired It’s tough criticism. conducted testing anyone else world unless believe China, USA 25th world tests per million isn’t good 330 million people test difficulty scaling degree. 

But sure, could testing readily available testing results.

People getting tested waiting 5-7 days results ridiculous. many people infect wait find out? many already hospital time damn results come back. 

Also antibody testing needs widely available subsidized. 1 antibody test per month 8 weeks per citizen want it. also says switch healthier diet, reap benefits fairly quickly. state long would be, assume years. So, eating junk now, cutting back junk adding nutrition something could seem need long period time reap rewards changing. 

Was sarcastic summarization above, summarization. super anti-gun Chinese wife asking get CCW. shit, times live in. know somebody Houston still holding idea it’s hoax we’re played. Absolutely boggles mind. Ofc city. Fuck man. like 4 million voters decided Biden cup tea, it’s impossible St. Bernard isn’t popular outside reddit. believe China requested investigate, US refuses.

What America hiding? Thats somewhat trend places. lot young people getting sick large chunk hospital capacity occupied 50 type shoulder surgery ?  Academia cancers growing inside decades (since least 80s). Greed, corruption, overbearing overpaid administration, rapidly increasing tuition, abuse PhD students, underpaying professors, stagnation meaningful research many fields, underfunding, pyramid scheme trying obtain professorship tenure, running colleges business school... long time coming. Many known bad academia become, able speak cause people afraid losing jobs. answer.

&amp;#x200B;

Cases started rising 3 weeks ago.

The average time (for people die) die Covid 3 weeks (sometimes much longer, IIRC 3 weeks avg.)

also cdc- takes extra time code COVID-19 deaths. 80% deaths electronically processed coded NCHS within minutes, deaths COVID-19 must coded manually, takes average 7 days.

&amp;#x200B;

so takes 4 weeks death trend move case trend moves

so means see increase death rate recent explosion cases, starting next week. also around time lot hospitals near capacity . near extra unemployment ends, near eviction protection runs out... believe end July shit show. stupid?

Heyhey, *IM* stupid lol..... chance. You’re discounting entire socialization element K-12, arguably important content. said like incredibly proud managed last eight entire days..... There's something everyone: Oh cool get giving birth last year. tested blood pregnant said wasn’t showing up... either vaccine little didn’t work body doesn’t process it. Hoping last shot worked Yeah, right. third knockout, way arms flail upwards afterwards, hear indicator brain damage. maybe explains he's way now...or maybe knucklehead got cage, hard say. dont get people arent 100% ok vaccine thread number reasons. Wheres batshit crazy reddit bots downvote declare 100% anti-vaxx make memes it, equating flat earthers. let's make hazmat suits compulsory too! gun people wear them! least get flu right fellow germophobes? ironic thing lot people go Target get away crazy people Walmart.  Legion scientists consider China origin single oxford scientist. Sorry bud People trying out-Karen here. Throwing ""this I'm Jewish"" end definitely easy that. like unemployment benefits, went without hiccup, others wait weeks/months.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* plenty conservative voices real life already I'll take word it- posted there? weird get half dozen comments post 18 minutes, especially one like Made good friend [The Noodle go Clemson they're requiring masks students, faculty, staff get tested come campus. There's way shut semester bc CV19. could use underground tunnels already exist. Tens thousands like him. many needless deaths. Agree. may never stop wearing mine grocery store ever. 250 number probably correct certainly would expect 1000 deaths today. Death rates falling surprise. even pandemic anymore. Push glasses little nose starting mask. Fog goes away. wear contacts, stand them.  confuse CFR IFR. IFR fully tallied pandemic run course, estimated 0.4 1.0%, settling 0.6% studies. entire population, including vulnerable. 50 estimated around 0.04% including comorbidities, 50 begins seriously spike along common heart disease blood disorders. 

The real threat virus comes unknown interactions causing body systems invades, us it'll stopped mucus layers nose throat pose threat. try avoid eating poison peanut bowl long possible prevention treatments found.


Poison Peanut Bowl = snack bowl peanuts, one may rotten seriously make ill kill you. still take handful? remember clearly. said one Chinese medicine ""it affect virus itself, seem anti-inflammatory properties"". He's team writing paper speak. Upvoting cause need positivity life. followed story breaks heart. fought hard. RIP Nick. Kudos spelling Vanbriesbrouck correctly!! already Canadian friends willing take in, I'm wondering far shit go could legitimately argue refugee status. pipe dream shit gonna get real long something change. never want see go up, that's 900 state - Florida today 10,000.

That said, I've thought since wrote that. Maybe reason NYC see spike protests still lockdown, many cases spread. Whereas Texas Florida partially reopened weeks earlier, infected people spread rallies (perhaps) think something lag deaths? 


You say ""facts"" ""science"" point catastrophe. 


Whats end game? people overblowing literal pandemic every single country took seriously hit them? hearing sentiment 4 months would still like know people get 0.5% death rate. town, 9% fatality rate. 9% older folks sure still, death rate order magnitude higher 0.5%. point, human rights violation IMO. literally millions cases, fucked dry land without them, there's nothing left ""protect"" keeping sea, cruel illogical imprisonment... Well reasoned, it’s difficult situation around. Lock beginning prolong outbreak, lock late look like don’t care citizens believe risk. 
Even physician find hard try weigh healthcare vs economic risks. would lot easier vaccine 1-2 months away. only.  past months best life. Even though country never went lockdown, US-based company issued company-wide work home order, help food delivery services, really go much, all.

I acquired 2 extra hours day free time due commuting, maybe 4 hrs week reduced social interaction obligations, I'm saving quite amount money this. entertainment home anyways, I've found finally start going steam library video library. 

It absolutely heaven, problems going like many months (and actually might given deteriorating conditions US). That's it.

Today shit day.

Richest country can't even provide affordable healthcare citizens tell flu kill 132,000 people 4 months vaccine slam dunk scalable theraputic. confidence eventually safe effective vaccine. confident widely accessible trusted 2021. 

My personal opinion Oxford vaccine promising; also uniquely well-positioned timing (and thus safety) standpoint; got head start done prior work vaccine coronavirus causes MERS, able take modify SARS2 coronavirus (the one causes COVID19) thus already real, no-joke phase III style testing. manufacturing approach also traditional old-school ""deactivated virus protein want body recognize trigger immune response to"" style vaccine, opposed novel less proven mRNA vaccine approach (basically Oxford started ahead, using proven methods vaccine development given us lifesaving vaccines already rely on).

Your goal keep viral load low. disease good chance avoided much less severe. exponential rise COVID cases Florida, hasn’t increase deaths?

I hope valid question, looking worldometers graphs would somewhat expected deaths rise increase cases, doesn’t seem shown correlation? beginning, anticipating hundreds thousands American deaths, May came was, like, ""Phew!""

It’s absolutely fucking BRUTAL. takes balls steel every time, even coworkers like oh shit comes.

Customers coughed me, screamed me, thrown shit me. it’s days lmao.

It doesn’t help decent amount coworkers don’t always wear mask properly. don’t want inconsistent single people out, often can’t say anything customers wearing mask manager 20 feet away around neck. Customers point looks like we’re following rules we’re trying enforce. it’s shit situation wish could something there’s virtually nothing make people wear masks, especially correctly.

SO MANY people aren’t wearing nose, even basically take talk, basically moment it’s important mouth.

Overall, I’ve realized past months Americans stubborn entitled country were.

What happen there’s virus 10x deadly? People still won’t wear mask.

The internet allowed information spread fast misinformation spread faster. Masks grant viral immunity. They're magical. California good remember shut everything first. work within MLB related marketing plan games streamed (nobody audience) many players getting sick that’s looking less less likely. research gets shut pretty quick, data classified warning

and “solved” capitalistic rationing. hard guess health insurance (if any) completely inadequate pandemic. going long path isnt much it. thank kindness. say doesn't? I've seen people ticketed  Canada, South Korea, New Zealand - functioning social safety nets, went complete lockdown, seen declining cases eradication.

I honestly find fucking wild much cult members justify absolute shitshow US ""well, measures dont really work anyway"" takes literally 10 seconds see absolutely worked elsewhere. Oh also less 1% die it. 

You check math. What’s 1% 3M? 🤦‍♀️ RemindMe! 3 Months mixing officially reported numbers actual cases deaths. wild guess situation India lot dire numbers suggest. Testing severely lacking. 

India 7k tests per 1m population. 

For comparison USA 113k per 1m, still missed lot positives. Double secret lockdown enough. reached point back April honestly. Actual Title: _CORONAVIRUS DAILY DEATHS 92.4% PEAK, DECLINED TEN STRAIGHT WEEKS_

Please remove resubmit actual title. reply post editorial seeming fishy. attest this. Vegas past week ~95% everyone saw wearing masks indoors (dropped around 75% outside), WAY boomers hanging around people would anticipated considering high risk are. also noticed people came across visiting either CA, FL, TX, coincidentally. People always say things like week deaths spike again. apologize unsolicited advice, knives tend make terrible self defense weapons. incredibly deadly, unless really know don’t stopping power alternatives. much better getting mace conceal carry permit. Stay safe. I’ve taking lot walks. WHAT'S BOX?! One disease I've mentally modeling covid lately dengue. much fear travelling dengue area short visit. use DEET, reality fatality rate dengue first time catch .02%. mosquito sneaks repellent, odds still really good.

But dengue one time, catch again, next time disease much severe. fatality rate jumps 50%. even though could still liberally apply bug spray, I'm suddenly situation longer comfortable odds. contracted dengue once, I'd probably avoid regions could contract again.

Right now, information odds covid killing *the first time.* know reinfected whether second infection would less severe. big question mark enough information judge risk causing conservative. proven standing sides escalator efficient one side standing side walking up. (When running max capacity). Guess trained personnel magically appear, huh? 1 4 people hospitalized COVID-19 die there. Except won’t mandate masks....

Nothing fishy fucking sad real battle... Maybe better diagnosed. Covid positive effects insurance line. first week weeks looked scared daily media briefings. space day went “it’s safe! Go vacation! enjoy March Break spend money!” “schools closed, retail closed, stay home, don’t socialise, shop week essentials”. wonder got must amazing persuasive skills. Ford tends rigidity flexibility thinking. see second part comment. Rt calculation done guys rt.live. best guess throw Montana might less cases shown relatively large growth. 100 cases went 150, grand scheme lot cases. However, example state cases grew 50%. 

Rt really looks infection spread. /r/Commahorror  Absolutely. “family” shit really means abusive relationship employer. Bars reopened month France fully pack virus come back full force, stop fearmongering. control US though vast majority cases people twenties thirties. people twenties thirties far likely die car accidents driving work coronavirus. Indeed, see graph Florida, age 50, two-thirds United States population is, almost zero risk dying coronavirus, even you’re infected.


YOU WONDER PEOPLE GIVE FLYING FUCK WEARING MASKS PROPERLY WANT RHE STORES GO OPEN BUSINESS NORMAL. BLAME TOP OFFICALS MAKE COMMENTS LIKE THIS. Alabama covid parties. First person test positive wins prize pool. im glad voting! anything get free sticker haha :) Yeah, basically unavailable general public pathetic failure many months in. Yes, often feel empowered justified act racism times like this. Anybody know bed capacity hospitals? Hmm no...statues still torn think so. “For moment, appeared restrictions public fear worked, reported new cases deaths virus dropped lowest levels May. new cases soon rose again, officials initially saying better testing causes numbers spike even lifted restrictions boost economic activity.

By mid-June, daily death tolls routinely rose triple digits. Sunday, Iran saw highest single-day reported death toll pandemic 163 killed.”

Huh, well sounds familiar. keep following Iran’s cases/death curves (as perfectly day) fatality surge still course ~7/22. daft? continues rise mitigation tactics used. naturally stop peaking unless going whole population affected. peak 10, 100, 100,000 million. point cases difficult control becomes, damaging society. natural phenomena like alluding. 16k members, get one day! kind shortcuts? source? sorry loss. hope find strength awful situation. doesn’t. mentions mutations observed April. headline doesn’t make seem like mutated either. says “we’re dealing mutated strain”. wrote really long bitchy thing half colleges deserve close scams guess something went wrong added comment.

Anyways, hope covid sheds light much institutions “higher learning” take advantage naive teenagers think becoming whatever want life nothing much money come (in America lots shitty countries case unfortunately). statistics used encourage kids beg parents take loans incredibly misleading lot schools need taken down.

 wish covid would go away maybe takes stop wide spread, insidious scam fair, 16 year old probably main problem here. 16 parents (or be) technically still responsible you. 

It's age group that's really bungling this. 25-45. 

And honestly, see alot people 45-65 age group give damn either so.

 -Robert Heinlein Lincoln Country Oregon actually   Checking ""misreading"" committee meeting. drives crazy fact many people charged Black Lives Matter movement Instagram, next post pool party masks on. moral virtue signalers have? throw window? Imagine audacity post pictures people judge irresponsible are. Another point wanna make... many medical professionals wearing masks. stupidity astounding. 112 students 1,000 students live neighborhood. ran 1300 tests pop-up site nearby. combination testing capturing milder cases, new cases significantly younger (fewer nursing home outbreaks far, primary driver deaths spring) treatments getting better (Oxford said hospitalized deaths fallen four-fold since April). spread also increasing, number tests leading cases, portion tests coming back positive increasing well, suggesting spreading faster ramp testing. many hospitals end reaching capacity, next weeks pretty rough. pay everyone's insurance premiums putting risk. See comment above. believe masks, make believe? know, know it, epidemiologists. full national lockdown two entire months. not. That's know. lot things equal risk (schools, sports, indoor mass events, etc.) - know, living Yep least ny they’re using attacks turn sentiment black people. It’ll work too. Black people responsible crimes committed dark skin people guys shades lighter, they’d called are, criminals. 

Crazy thing idk could even it. clean record, college educated ass gonna persuade unintelligent thugs committing hate crimes. Ima get ass kicked too. 

I saw someone nyc sub say “Asians remember this.” hurt soul 35m people yet another stigma thrown em thousand pieces shit. can’t even blame cuz don’t answers. Yeah socioecomic connections criminality that, poverty doesn’t make stupid. damn sure doesn’t make commit targeted attacks. So, I’m loss. Get Organize. can't. I'm Canadian, living Germany. Europe better health system also companies. So...

Some said: like game, hate system player That's true. also fewer people ideologically committed ignoring virus. mean, *way many* (speaking OC resident) absolute terms, relative terms could make difference. Corona virus stay surfaces like originally thought remember. 

If want stay inside mom's basement day jerk off. fine let adults productive adults.

If problem staying inside 6 months seems like pretty big waste society anyway. chance id send kids school 2021 regardless say AA lobbyist I'd too. I'd also explain middle seats expensive, usually bought last minute. 

And thank smoking.

Idea: Store makes app available allow customers flag spreader taking photo face, uploads facial recognition system spots checkout lane alerts people front refuse them. Right on! don’t see cost medical care responsibility malls.

It isnt. cost visitor safety unfair fail controlling virus ask businesses something

And yet, Dept. Health puts burden safety restaurant, even though humans failed controlling huge number pathogens. Restaurants must buy sneeze guards sorts shit prevent spread common illnesses like seasonal flu. saying shouldnt fail control every agree it’s good lower cost prevention, pays it? govt pay...

Everything business cost gets rolled price products sold anywhere. go mall buy shit there, pay cost mall operation. taxpayer shoulder expense instead he/she doesnt go there. never go malls, paying? Probably read article. received MMR vaccine child likely still antibodies measles, mumps rubella viruses, unlikely still MDSCs, says Dr. Fidel. means would require ‘booster’ vaccination obtain potential benefits COVID-19. Test numbers also remained quite high weekend. numbers today 19,000+ tests. sound proud.  Wait what? Incidents? someone *accidentally* commit hate crime? we're already reaching back decades. current safety tests eliminate concern? get polio years later they? live Georgia elementary school age children. support making children wear masks - preferred solution beyond that? doubt wearing mask would satisfy people favor continued school shutdowns. quit job stay home home school children teachers don’t go schools? children go another school year without learning? Trust can’t work teach children full day without losing job, remote learning 2 hours day like last spring joke 2nd-4th graders. alternative would make happy without sacrificing children’s education? Good stepping up. Universities opening ridiculous simply ploy get tuition students re-close students start inevitably contract COVID. Risking future. United, basically airlines back full capacity demand rising.

Also pretty expensive. Maybe 1.75x normal. Beautifully crafted.  Well, it’s already mutated least 2 strains. Also remind we’ve successful developing vaccine virus Carona family? don’t vaccine common cold?

Your suppression real concern going lead people rosy path definitely vaccine soon, don’t bother mask. Read article. antibodies, another type immune system response (MDSCs) stimulated types vaccines (i.e. live attenuated vaccines). received MMR vaccine child likely still antibodies measles, mumps rubella viruses, unlikely still MDSCs, says Dr. Fidel. means would require ‘booster’ vaccination obtain potential benefits COVID-19.

Oh makes sense, easy grow high percentage starting number low. Try 6 months? Maybe less, people followed proper regulations.

Or. 

For every person gets sick, pay medical bill. MSNBC talking huge wave deaths coming Deaths keep dropping, Oxford vaccine approved two months, way people may caught virus think meaning death rate even lower think this, too? literally seen one thing direction. think really, really weird indicative something deeply wrong. mean, way that, guess already suggested, issuing general problem response. friends partying bars clubs, dating, gyming, traveling, working month, scrolling insta posts/stories jealousy Think this. Florida cases didn’t shoot lockdown lifted. shot bars, restaurants, young people gained confidence around Memorial Day. full lockdown isn’t worth Great Depression #2. Going work, wearing mask telling people(coworkers)to fuck get close works. Going bars, partying pretending isn’t pandemic doesn’t. I’ve seen later example last month half.

I’m 34 25% health. motivating see. Yes, eminent fuckhead, sacrifice elderly mighty dollar, Dan Patrick CNN,MSNBC,CDC,WHO name few. point people deserve infected. seems way Americans believe virus real. hit hurts. WANT like many Governors determined reactive rather proactive. Instead keeping schools closed, might let open let virus spread unchecked while, *then* close? Why?

Do really think there's chance it'll fine virus disappear own? consequence total paranoia. well attitude! cheer up. best take precautions, wear masks, take one day time. we’re together. get back normal life, things ok end long part preventing spread. try remember every time stay home wear mask, stopping getting sick dying. also stops others getting sick dying. don’t like it, every person social distancing isolating helps make sure pandemic won’t prolonged even more. Hearing stories people know Obamacare plans makes happy employer's insurance. deductible $3k, average i've heard people ObC plans around $8k. know i'm fortunate sudden $3k bill financially ruin me...but $8000 would.

Giving back people took ain't gonna make rich guy Reddit actually read headline correctly first time. coming announcement week, sadly.

One good thing social media -- say whatever want without concern government agency knock door little chat.

Oh ya going back school 4 weeks going completely safe. LOL. planet CDC credible WHO. talking Chinese CDC, you? happy current circumstances?

Better eat sugar reasons too. get covid19, wont want sugared that, lots inflammation. hope noped ride. Astonishing levels stupidity short-sightedness. Found couple words all. Oh, selfish. money guys willing risk season means absolutely nothing anyone would like see national teachers strike, don’t much hope happening. many teachers would afraid go it. many states, illegal us strike. states, would risk losing job, would lose ability get future jobs states like Texas permanently revoke teaching certificate strike. Sick burn man. Yeah! use it? sure name study something week two ago saying 11 minutes artificial UV-C exposure, 20 minutes sunny day around 2 hours fall air circumstances. f'ing flat madness!

Hahahaha oh that's good one. Even true, would last single day 99% them. multiple detections back December 2019, makes sense... virus left China much earlier people think.

YES. everything I’ve seen general population tolerate year don’t know would cause people realize time serious measures/wide spread civil disobedience.

I don’t know why. I’ll tell though: reddit literally place life people seem concerned virus. There’s place else, physical internet, seems like people take seriously. wonder it’s vast majority people don’t read/only watch fox/maybe people act like care really. contrary statistics I’ve read. really don’t know.

I mean people cared wouldn’t mobilize? :/

I also wonder people able absorb what’s happen survived SARS, overcome covid. know consequences China causing one worst viruses due fucked eating habits? Wow.

I also live myself, 27 healthy far family anyone normally see would high risk. someone like life I'd prob stop things lower risk. Go dawgs new outbreaks primarily younger cohort pervasive spread elder care facilities, yet. Treatments preserve life also come long way last months, beginning doctors basically flying blind. Unfortunately people overwhelming hospitals two weeks already sick agreeing liking government does, did, do, death toll. foolish enough shut everything early minimize spread seemed 20 time less death rates Sweden did. Sweden, UK, US, roll dice population made funeral services fastest rising business since WW2. Italy, one lenient, time realized dealing already pretty late. countries shut watched nothing, denying going problem.

You arguement trolling bro, congrats got me. 

Enjoy. replies. really get mask hate 

It's pretty straightforward. They've spent decades pushing worship anti-intellectualism turning professionals experts pariahs. opinion every Tom, Dick, Harry become sacrosanct facts recommendations scientists medical experts valueless. reason Canada ranked #1 world one stupid fucked culture Ok, can't read. American's support additional lockdowns cases spike. thing saying ""The majority Americans bunkered in."" can't tell difference, can't help you. Exactly thoughts. I've got well rounded set skills construction hospitality I'm concerned finding work area even pandemic going on. months quarantine nothing...it saves hundreds thousands lives... Hmm.. Well, little good news think. appears tech sector getting lot open Work Home arrangements now.

I've unemployed since April got 1 year contract software engineering job WFH. relieved safely stay quarantine support family, next year least. numbers order magnitude then, far worse expected... wrote fellow Kansan.

I live purple area. haven’t hit hard Dodge City KC area, cases climbing quickly.

Our county seems think cannot mandate masks, city did, thank god. county kept saying, hospitals fine need mandate masks. don’t seem get time hospitals longer fine FAR LATE. 

I hear Trump/Pence talking points every time one opens mouths. fever symptom. Asymptomatic means zero symptoms. None. lose sense smell, asymptomatic. get stuffy nose, asymptomatic. asymptomatics people would never single reason think sick get tested whatever reason. feel scared might able make ICU—maybe possible double lung transplants (god forbid) rejected body dies, late transplant dies. he’ll facing numerous obstacles recovery face lot problems like numerous people do. 

He one year old son, (god forbid dies) won’t remember dad, stories mom remember it, like kids lost mom and/or dad pandemic have. 

I intensely creeping feeling won’t make alive rehab, ICU. hope isn’t case, feeling won’t way. Haha yeah that's happening here, without form medicare all. Really? See ever hear strong teacher unions states, glad that. sucks. say less deadly. Says ""not severe"". we've got now. chances Oxford vaccine actually approved (I understand doesn’t mean distributed) fall? I’m worried I’m getting hopes high. Thank you! thinking well. I'm sick carp well. he's saying got test results back yet ""HAVE TESTED POSITIVE COVID DAY"". I'm sorry, symptoms go anyways douchebag. Also, I'm sorry. large percentage people asymptomatic. Vaccinate risk first (old, known preexisting conditions, etc). let anyone wants vaccine get it. Parents vaccinate kids want. alone, you’ve knocked people get sick enough hospitalization die. Exactly. Either close all, don’t close any. 

Your flea analogy reminded cockroaches Manhattan. buildings constantly sprayed, run buildings next them. buildings sprayed, run back, ad infinitum. Well built new hospital probably wants get monies worth insurance companies... wish joking.  think considering reopening without precautions, least Ontario. understanding we're looking classes half size, continuing online/distance learning, mix two. probably know till couple weeks starting watch situation develops. Actually increased 23 icu. White woman asperger’s here; think time.

My father called cops “help” me. brought K-9 unit house, meltdown right floor front cops, situation culminated shaking father’s hand telling great future ahead (I 33).

It’s constitutional right go wherever want, whenever want. even read it? /s Orange one won’t like this... post articles showing huge spikes non-shithole states protests? keep saying going happen I'm still saying it. Look apeshit people went first time around. matter badly might need happen, ain't happening. think point America, would take people dying streets people even remotely consider lockdown again. entire pants industry go under(wear). 50 damn people? mind. crazy talk. Confinement viable long term solution. life Portugal, small country Europe closed everything extremely early pandemic installed strick quarantines, closing business sticking people homes months. managed reduce spread point, economy handle it, lots lost jobs, bankruptcy countless businesses even government aid. Also increasing quarantine fatigue, even majority population adhering quarantine country hailed example containment virus, people tired end kept relaxing daily habits.

These days? Portugal example worse reasons, behind Sweden cases per capita. confinement lifted soon everything went shit, surges cases hotspots, health minister admiring government track transmission chains many new cases.

What example shows social distancing quarantines viable extended period time, economic colapse physical emotional fatigue people. virus pernicious transmits long often ”stealthy” incubation period, new flair cases inevitably soon containment phase ends.

The solution vaccine. little US do, small country total lockdown, compliment population one physical land border can't handle it, much doubt gigantic federal country multitude people, extended decentralized government, able it. what's worst case scenario vaccine like this? complications worse Covid-19? I’ve yet see story someone symptomatic twice. Probably better taking precautions wearing masks... Trump super spreader. Trump offered bounty American deaths Putin offered Taliban? really disagree. work grocery store outside Sacramento.

The right-wingers far between.

The people aren’t wearing masks lazy/overweight people aren’t political issue, they’re feel like can’t breath get irritated break mask. nearly enough seriousness warning risky behaviours. many people attention die unnecessarily hospitals ICUs get full overflowing. 
They say staying hotel low risk? Crazy. Sharing indoor air hundreds people ... Elevators, corridors, lobbies ... low risk. That's... true. 
The cases SK two negative tests second positives. 

Still mean reinfection, pointing people tested negative positive again. allowed drive through, typically proof live Alaska. must drive directly Alaska.

They expected food water. must sleep vehicle. interaction Canadians illegal.

If caught following rules, may banned future entry. r/coronavirus big brother state. name iconic duo.

i pro mask y'all crazy Maybe we'll start naming vaccine(or probably modified form): MMRC Vaccine. Much ring it. Damn you’re rude wrong.

The official state website never cases 1,000. Click daily trends: . want stores shut mayor city allowed gatherings 50 people 4th. virus cares holidays something. really regret moving Canada chance years ago. carry hand sanitizer. spray atm gas pump helps next person too.  There's much news, know right.   Dude OC shithole country. many conspiracy theorist, anti-vaxxers area. Something drunk suburban housewife miserable lifestyle pretending middle class really makes people seek internet ""truth"" there. called leader joke. face gives migraine. hope it’s publicity stunt. friends idiots, I’m rapidly drifting away especially year. I’m maturing faster it’s really starting show now. Cheers, know difference words see them, got little carried away. never claimed smart man... Idaho huge ""don't tell attitude"" 

I see got out, mask on, 95% wearing mask. Anyone Texas? so, tell us happened neighborhood ppl wearing masks there.. bit long encapsulated thoughts this: I’m honestly sure make reports reinfection lately (it’s one questions I’ve reviewing project part data mined literature), one hand there’s mixed news least showing mount level antibody T-cell response acutely COVID-19, monkeys (to extent good model) protected month infection active case, hand seems wane (in people) [after around 2 months Chinese data, albeit still preliminary findings. preliminary reading whatever it’s worth: suspect reports reinfection like saw South Korea March, virus remnants fragments aren’t really re-infectious picked tests second time around. suspect cases so-called “long-haulers”, people infected COVID-19 didn’t entirely clear it, got false negatives subsequent tests testing positive again, original infection. (Though relapse worrisome way.) 

On hand feel like it’s getting increasingly difficult dismiss notion least cases genuine COVID-19 reinfection like what’s strongly suspected linked article here. Doesn’t mean it’s common rule general, indeed happen taken account. main factor pulling direction addition scattered reports, recent publication (in press) looked 11 COVID-19 patients broad age range (teens 90s). Tl;dr: symptomatic COVID-19 infection tested positive. cleared infection (no longer symptomatic, tested negative). varying subsequent periods, became symptomatic again, re-tested found positive (""clinically virologically positive""). hard time believing 11 somehow got false negative results apparently magically became positive **with symptoms**\--not dead/residual RNA fragments amplified asymptomatic patients like Korean study, full-blown COVID-19 again. Another study along sort similar lines: extent credible, Redditors COVID19 positive sub reporting anecdotal cases reinfection, including one case family previously infected COVID19 testing negative, another member testing positive members family manifesting symptoms (can’t see explicable “simultaneous relapse” true, would come infection first reinfected family [scattered sailors USS Theodore Roosevelt got initial infection, tested positive **with symptoms** (not asymptomatic cases). 

So mean overall? don’t buy hyper-pessimistic argument vaccine impossible, clearly early vaccine results indicate able prime immune system extent. time, I’m questioning idea might ever “one-and-done” vaccine single immunisation conferring long term immunity, traditional herd immunity even possible. Clearly get COVID-19 control lot countries shown, goal bringing R0 well 1. it’s going drawn-out, messy process without magic inoculation rather, combination better drugs management, vaccines varying effectiveness requiring re-inoculation (probably frequent flu shots), disciplined public health measures including tracking, border controls (including states necessary) and, yes, masks least periodic basis foreseeable future, least get viral counts low. 

Tl;dr: looking like least patients reinfection (rather relapse long-haulers possible), better treatments vaccines least partially effective, may single one-and-done immunisation, combination good public health practices including tracking, border monitoring masks, able bring better control way ex. Taiwan, Greece Vietnam have. “iT’S pArT ExPeRiEnCe”  It’s length time spend bathroom close others 

Bars 1000x Wonder also kids haven’t really hard hit since would received vaccine. Actually sad. Sounds like she’s manic schizophrenic. never said good business overflow icus. said good optimize capacity. Learn read. 

The eli5 version help you: patients, hospital loses money layoff staff. many patients, face inefficient staffing mixes transportation costs shifting/redirecting new patients facilities (that also own, come issues). Gotta get patient / staffing mix right maximize $$$$. parents ever read little red riding hood you? None suggests started outside China. ""lie dormant"", takes exponential growth kick in. Ah, see man culture well. Oxford showing positive results. starting large scale trials Brazil enough candidates England. already producing vaccine large scales companies well ready approved. like 7th time, hypotheticals don’t matter evidence right front face around (even subreddit) clearly don’t won’t quarantine. Yeah mistaken. executive order law. *See* Tex. Gov’t Code § 418.012. may statute passed legislature legislature said executive orders proclamations “the force effect law.” *Id* know start movement, racist want? Clearly, NO. sadly true haven’t seen one thing anything Michigan related since rednecks stormed building guns. Hopefully soon become known states follow know people like (and fairly educated, mostly engineers) California, Louisiana, Texas, Germany, UK, Denmark, Kazakhstan, on. first thought purely Texas thing. species difficult time processing things challenge worldview. Yup that’s reasoning. Plus hotels going eat, there’s way many variables play say it’s safe. jumping car going quick ride get (not stopping anywhere Public) go it. Driving across country. bueno. Good point. makes feel better situation. Thank you. can’t, many sick people enough beds moment Well they're going die. fact are. way is. didn’t:

July 3rd 726 cases 
And yesterday good measure 533 [source 

Also confirmed state website 

Worldometer really shitty unreliable comes NY’s data. It’s like watching zombie movie broken know people going die Pretty sure they're underreporting deaths. remember reading huge spike ""Pneumonia deaths"" Body weight exercises, stretching, running, walking, biking, dumbells, kettle bells (both bought stores online).

Very easy do. anyone start worry unemployment them... Can’t seem get anything done. know ever happen, certainly going happen long daily deaths keep falling. Hint: Introverts inherit Earth! make brain much stupider alerting presence man? don’t think either activity huge risk. choose protest elbow elbow crowds screaming day, vs beach avoid people, I’d take beach.

But that’s really point, it? point beach goers Michigan protests = terrible danger, BLM protests = minimal danger. least that’s narrative. seem lapped narrative like little doggy. Good boy! Good boy! This. Hurts. Brain. Reading. Hard. I’m Georgia Tech alumni got 2013. I’m proud school professors standing up. GT known rarely closing doors meat grinder, something student always lamented. It’s heavily research focused institution, literally billions dollars government corporate grants flow it. It’s time put safety students faculty first. Meanwhile America burning given Yikes that’s terrible. county thinks immune there’s people. virus doesn’t care judging much people partying 4th it’s gonna get lot worse weeks. reality no, half country care reality There's saying German goes approximately ""ingratitude world's reward"" contagious absolutely zero symptoms? Like spreading without fever? can't shed mask never wore it. mention psy-ops anti lockdown crowd. Every states anti lockdown protest websites created one day period shell company Florida. know who's behind gut says either billionare corporate types, Russians/Chinese CIA types. Unless ""New York Cityyy!""

(Referencing old BBQ sauce commercial) onto something. COVID-19 picked China's respiratory illness early warning system genetically similar SARS December 2019. system collects samples patients showing medical system repository symptoms look matches known infectious agents. went back sample library that's allowed find positive samples back November earlier.

This system put place wake SARS detect potential pandemic illness. country system place. That's exactly point. Thank you. second that. mind whispers awhile, whisper back - dog jerk, get sick, he'll end pound.

I stay quarantine. know, could ordered Trump release China nothing gets US. crafted Putin course. (takes tin toil hat) surprising least. way things right now, unless going would kill me. I'm going in. 

So far, thing I've really put dentist appointment. Hopefully nothing serious happens mean time. Mean while, across lake... think batshit. focusing attention actually sick rather obsessing big numbers ""cases"" 50% asymptomatic. remember state Australia best plans top everything, cases shrinking nothing...

Now states shut borders us, people getting forcibly locked apartment buildings, cases reaching worst point since virus began. 

Shit switch real fast, especially people get complacent. Please dump him, he's clearly showing care safety also yours. Wasn’t simple Canada either. crazy anti mask people complaining freedoms selfish  Speaking devil... hope patient’s families treat well. there’s anything I’ve learned doctors know love, it’s America literally runs nurses y’all wildly underappreciated.  can’t comprehend constant news stories people beach main cause. It’s much easier distance beach bar protesting 1000’s people street. agree. 79. start smoking crack, teach, whatever. paid dues, owe nothing anyone. make 75 eat chicken wings every day, whatever body still capable doing.

Again, point make claim 100% proof. OP. Right keep reposting articles non-stop? Get sick instead taking days off. medical case, vacation. would think quarantined amongst long virus would already died out. Idk maybe. Enforced well NY/NJ ""quarantine"". There's way case death statistics accurately recorded. infrastructure lot parts India Oh, absolutely.

There's level fucking that's impossible reach unless actually trying get there. nothing like flu also exactly like flu? Ok, got nothing chemicals needed testing. source any. ask US industry this. piss Chinese chemicals.

Another HUGE failure Team DoNothing want parkrun re-start least. Rest ok Take bus!! buses US? It’s incredibly selfish, sure. Unfortunately feel selfishness fueled politics, course has, people want make scenes “muh rights.” right ignore health guidelines benefit you, everyone #FreeThePeen paid? pick both. Infectious disease one biggest points contention ADA, made clear scientific basis communicable public situation, places make accommodations ok discriminate. written carefully, order prevent people HIV/AIDS discriminated against, since contagious public setting. I've kind lost hope honestly. really have. city enacted mandatory mask ordinance good thing. Several local businesses said enforce arguing customers frequently become belligerent hostile employees deal kind abuse.  ordinance also geared around education get caught wearing mask, cops provide one many people saying they'll take mask take soon cop leaves. end result ordinance really enforceable.

It's incredibly frustrating me. voluntary lockdown bunch people chose participate it. we're reopened restrictions am. county opted issue guidelines also opted explicitly state enforcing guidelines. Cases going back up. local hospitals health officials say need restrictions. county commission adamantly insist ""people right thing"" even though absurdly obvious won't. Every one friends seems tell overblown covid past despite case count ticking upwards. incredibly frustrating. treat thing like flu. 

When state ICU bed capacity, quick easy access COVID testing/results kind treatment high percentage working.

I get rapid flu test Rx tamiflu treatment less hour PCP, I’ll feel comfortable done new coronavirus. guess fair denie people like care get covid right ? Ooo wait what...the disease doesnt create antibodies. white blood cells (body) popularity points. well aware disparaging American people blaming virus’s wide spread relative countries popular right now. interested facts popularity internet points don’t matter. Totalitarian regimes oligarchies struggle reality science, response challenge power. 

It's almost automated response. totally free ignore science comes you. Wearing masks you. people. like eating mcdonalds, doesnt mean Im retarded enough wear mask public. One concerns you, everyone. Thats diet basicly Hell? stupid! There’s way virus 110 days. There’s literally point this. many rich people’s tax returns seen??? things writing think trying stay positive reading writing good all. diseases share symptoms and/or qualities doesn’t mean they’re exactly alike. Moron. amazing true, I'm yet point believe respiratory virus less dangerous people poor-functioning lungs. Still going extra super careful. Someone needs tell COVID black lives matter It’s bad us media makes u think. may rise cases, deaths going LOT despite opening back up. think it’s ran it’s course lot states already. hits nursing home population, loses momentum afterwards. That’s vulnerable sit. That's bunk. There's thing zero risk, immunizing third population means thing continue make rounds unabated. protect fraction population virus continue hospitalize people require constant mitigation.

Further, walked right past point people 30 dying much they're experiencing long term possibly irreversible health effects result infection. 

Not zero risk, asinine amount known risk due irrational fear vaccine would tested thousands gets rolled out.  That's risk reward, anti vax ignorance. Might well bring back measles we're it. *Let's see goes*.

*Is safe tough guy image wear mask now?* literally heard man PA hotel lobby weekend (without mask course) bitching governor thinks surgeon General tyrant.

His next comment ""unless protestor, allowed want, us hard working people"" probably feels weird say ignorant vaguely misogynistic anti science victim complex bullshit without also including thinly veiled racism. gone April. overseas surely affects opinion dealing with. That's also unique counting system. They're country reporting somewhat possible deaths covid deaths, whereas countries count definite ones. They're pretty open overcounting. Oddly, I’m going direction, although non-Covid related. lockdown realized wasn’t commute making tired time probably get sleep apnea finally taken care of. 

Got prescription doc I’m scheduling sleep study today. That's ""reasonable"" reasonable accommodation. stores kerbside home delivery let know. That's reasonable accommodation. Endangering others isn't.

/s briefing summer outside Tuesdays Thursdays, currently 115 people ICU covid19. -14 compared Friday, continuing encouraging downwards trend severe cases hospitalizations.

Additional note, SCB (Statistics Sweden) continuing update preliminary death reports excess deaths compared previous five years identified. summer specific news release weekly update, access Excel sheet data here: ; Excess deaths normal levels end June, later data still lacking full reporting.

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Useful links:

But simple chest congestion get cold (which people downplay it) fact far serious isn'tinor acute treated cough syrup much serious damage. Everything bigger Texas. Um. opposite response Trump Bolsonaro. (and still is) strict lockdown. Masks mandatory step house. strictest lockdown (from March end May) 1 member household allowed outside time, essential activities. helps ton I'm working home cook meals home worry bringing food office anything. also work whenever want. found current return office date January 6th 2021, pretty happy haha. Thats good stuff right LOL... Ooga-booga... LOL You’re missing point. said would masters. dont think works case. Also, university made classes remote. non committal travel visa situation. Congress went two week break. comes next something worse. Tourists think week we'll see numbers rise two weeks we'll see people suffering dying. Look big man reading article, congratulations. Never underestimate stupidity people large groups. long old people ones voting, old people run country, also means old people entertainment like cruise ships, always live Catch movie (from protagonists perspective). surprised every day see stories ""some person went Florida vacation, returned home caused outbreak"". feel like must coming. What? didn’t say nobody cleaning stuff. It’s likely cleaned well. aren’t paid enough actually care, wanna get done move restocking whatever go home. 

Also, Target $15/hr masks required, definitely shop support IMO. Several governors stepped up. issue, though, strong President could overridden useless weak one saved hundreds thousands lives. feds top testing, mandating safety protocols reopening, manufacturing testing safety supplies, preserving people's livelihoods, etc would different story. Well someone going trips thats I'm talking Yeah, mistake. 

I say though, right move obviously, feel bars employees owners. Like, industry survive potentially business rest year handful states? countries would keep virus going long. CANNOT keep virus going, long. POWER. *STAMINA.* *ALL YEAR LONG* want to. **USA #1 GREATEST EVER CHAMPIONS CORONAVIRUS BABYYYYYY** Yeah, virus pretty much thing that's unbiased Gyms exists years. optimistic folk roll dice walk virus infested place. politely disagree that. Nobody state ones close even act like it’s happening live Tennessee. Judging fourth weeks cases going skyrocket deaths go them, don’t see outcome. 

I stay home much possible four year old high risk even go get groceries it’s like Russian roulette point ones masking trying stay away people. 

No one social distance walk right beside one wears damn mask either. feels like threatening life pure head sand idiotic behavior. nearly burst laughing Bill Gates part. Yeah somehow think virus cares whether believes not.  colleges reopen

I still think colleges fully reopen fall (for undergraduates). is, many classes across SUNYs slowly migrated online fall. announcements supposed delivered coming weeks feel recent surge South may cause postponement. can't speak private universities sure follow suit Source claim? Oh, know, I'm volunteer therapist spare time. absolutely right, though, family much harder deal with. matter much try remember training, knows needle delights so. Sometimes disengaging earns worse abuse engaging bullshit, try roll it. least physical distance living halfway around world helps. XD delayed months. think like 90% deaths reported within 10 days, deaths takes longed due control death cause death certs. 


Some measures: Ban visitors elderly homes, secondary schools closes, universities distance classes, crowds 50ppl, bars &amp; restaurants service tables, distancing, etc. Recommendations e.g. unnecessary travels, social distancing, stay home symptoms, work home, special recommendations elderly, social distancing, etc. 


I think summer, ok outside more, open windows, etc, whole truth. (And cuz people vacations, pure BS. 


Immunity? Stockholm like 17% antibodies couple weeks ago + cells, might help. many parts Sweden numbers. heard someone high government say heat kills coronavirus like flu virus. fair there’s issue messaging participating one dense outdoor activity (protests) green lighted deemed contributed spike (beaches) seems subject grudge Newsom has.

Slowly reopening obviously help, inevitably lead spike roll back (just matter when, if). Purely anecdotally, sweet spot seems outdoor dining/activities mask mandate indoor visits. consensus foreseeable future. sure r/collapse Right? Everything feels better. kinda fell back old ways last week started eating crappy foods exercising much, end week felt like garbage. never want again. scroll far comment. wanted help people PSA’s covid sucks ass. feels like attention grab. like Tom Hanks leaves bad taste mouth. drop dime university take safety precautions seriously now. classes definitely remote classes starting bachelor's, general education courses taken online affordable colleges transferred university. great way improve self fitness opinion first month home without working start lifting weights keep going crazy man miss staying home 2 months Right, also gas stations, fast food, theaters, job hires younger workers. never washed dishes hand before. know? trained kids ice cream store. dishes would rinsed water soap dry hard, disgusting crust. didn’t understand old dairy bad thing. purpose?

However glad see didn’t happen. city staying top epidemic keeping risky activities like indoor dining shut down, still encouraging everyone get tested, building contact tracing capacity, keeping hospital beds available, etc.

Not really. wanted challenge point suggested stated something opposite article written about. positing US *would* get doses. merely pointing *did* get initial doses initial output rate.

Aw see authority better not? used number article well point certainly disingenuous anyone understood it. pointing supposition even US got doses, would take 3-4 years directly contradicts article.

That point contradict article all. entire point going take long time vaccinate everyone. found moron guys blind faith anything anyone. opposite extreme absurd. Imagine blind faith everything federal government bad, instead evaluating case case issue issue basis. I'll take vaccine developed medical professionals, thanks. good news continues, I’d shocked didn’t vaccine end year, let alone April 2021.

#The goal testing 100,000 people week suspected covid-19 yet achieved. according Public Health Authority, regions started large-scale testing.

Last March, Public Health Authority commissioned government help regions increase sampling covid-19. early April, Karin Tegmark Wisell, Head Public Health Agency, stated within weeks 100,000 tests could taken per week suspected covid-19.


Last week, 75,000 tests conducted Sweden.

- figure 100,000 reasonable level aim for, relevant higher lower. goal appropriate testing, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.

*The goal expanding capacity around long time, think satisfactory result, looks now?*

- Right think good result.

#FHM: Large-scale testing underway

SVT News showed last week [minority regions could offer covid-19 tests anyone wants test themselves]( . test still varies across country, according Tegmark Wisell, lot testing capacity happened recent days. Next week, even regions expected get started large-scale testing.

- regions established process establishing large-scale testing regions yet opportunity establish large-scale testing.

#Longer time expected

At time, taken longer expected, says Tegmark Wisell.

- probably underestimated complexity. expect take long.

#Continued lack material

In cases, regions waiting start large-scale testing avoid impact healthcare, according Tegmark Wisell. also difficult quickly establish required digital systems problems access materials.

Initially, problems test sticks [swabs] - latest issue lack sampling tubes.

- Every week, look capacity laboratories ensure materials available. friend mine works government went quarantine around time. happy home playing video games reading books.

Archive link: corona virus affects people millions program areas particularly hard. Four new researchers state new Swedish study. 

- said beginning covid equal. contrary – front covid, inequalities inequalities shown even more, says Professor Kristina Jakobsson.

It well known corona pandemic hit hard elderly. population groups Sweden also disproportionately affected. 
A new study shows **excess mortality spring 220 percent people 40 years born Somalia, Syria Iraq compared period previous four years.**
A death toll level entire population would amount additional 44,000 deaths Sweden. 
In comparison, mortality among people born Sweden, EU, Nordic countries North America decreased 1 percent among persons aged 40 65 period, increased 19 percent persons older 65 years. 

Kristina Jakobsson, professor department community medicine public health University Gothenburg, one four researchers behind study published Medical Journal .

She points ethnicity structural causes increase risk getting infected becoming seriously ill covid-19. 

- fact used country birth marker social differences easy get data Statistics Sweden (Statistics Sweden), says continues: 

- groups come country relatively late. Many come recent years ended metropolitan areas big cities live tight spot multi-generation housing. 

All all, meant pandemic less opportunity social distancing home - work.

- Often work care, service transport. jobs work home. carry much social need exists. also means work environment higher risk infected, says Kristina Jakobsson. 

Recently, Public Health Authority presented report occupational groups highest relative risk diagnosed covid-19. top taxi drivers, pizza bakers well bus tram drivers. 

In new study, researchers also point million program areas high proportion work nurses nursing assistants. hypothesis infection may circles work, public transport residential areas. 

- areas fewer people car generally lower degree education. really looking around - working healthcare, care service sectors metropolitan areas? says Kristina Jakobsson continues:

- said beginning front covid equal. contrary, face covid, disparities inequalities appear even more. country like countries.
In survey postal codes, Expressen also shown proportion infected covid-19 higher vulnerable suburbs .
In United Kingdom United States , too, similar social differences observed different population groups affected covid-19. 
**The researchers believe Swedish strategy, information social distance, taken sufficient account situation different population groups.** 
Faced feared continued spread infection autumn, Kristina Jakobsson believes authorities need systematically map looks different geographical environments. 
- need basic understanding differences order prevent spread infection. need know looks like average people come test themselves. figure little finger resourceful come test spontaneously.

haha okay, buddy. follow logic, wear pants public either. muh right!

just wear mask stay away people, hard. Lets hope effective. Getting every doctor, nurse first responder option increased level immunity would amazing.

We've hung since March already: we'll get there.  stupidity entirely product domestic policy.  Florida partying problem. went Snapchat maps holiday weekend see people to, amount people partying disturbing. I’m talking people sharing drinks, packed apartments/living rooms/cars without masks, getting others’ faces, etc. NYTimes article corroborates that.

The surge we’re midst might approach NYC/northern Italy levels given population density/elderly population/lack mask culture. difference Florida places state failing take proper measures, people inclined party hard. It’s unprecedented sort surge people continue engage sorts activities. would horrifying see people act like NYC/Italy March/April surging, that’s exactly we’re now.

Maybe informing public *why* people wear masks beginning. mandate every state, figure themselves. mistake. Slow steady win race. novel virus humans, highly contagious airborne. insane think get different result. believe deaths slower ton increase time around, unless hospitals get seriously overwhelmed. current gap cases death due combination testing capturing huge number milder cases, new cases significantly younger (fewer nursing home outbreaks far, primary driver deaths spring) treatments getting much better (Oxford researchers said hospitalized deaths fallen four-fold since April). spread also increasing, number tests leading cases, portion tests coming back positive increasing well, suggesting spreading faster ramp testing. many hospitals end reaching capacity, may lose gains made treatment since April. seen study posted several times people post idea read information inside study.

Edit: /u/dragonjock27 fervent supporter current president btw, you’re wondering he’s bringing shitty HCQ study it’s feels like brave genius leader needs true.

At Swedavia's airports, recommended wear face mask inside terminal, P4 Gotland reported.

The recommendation applies airports Arlanda, Landvetter, Bromma, Malmö, Luleå, Umeå, Åre, Visby, Ronneby Kiruna.

The recommendations started apply gradually, starting Arlanda Monday.

Formally, adaptation safety protocols European Aviation Safety Authority EASA, says Lovisa Ernestam Swedavia's press service.

- expectation people wear face masks airports, least internationally. addition, aircraft require today.

TT: happens wear face mask?

- one rejected. perhaps staff come forward inform possibility buying mouthguards airport, says Lovisa Ernestam.

On hand, mouth protection requirement staff working Swedavia's airports close contact travelers. keep seeing stories ready October. possible? world? Lockdown fucking sucked. Get early drive shuttles.

One good thing say Sweden tabloids pretty much best int world terms *sometimes* producing amazing journalism! really shockign read see *sometimes* excellent journalism coming Aftonbladet Expressen. interesting phenomenon. heard Finland way Ilta Sanomat Iltalehti. Denmark BT is... good Ekstra Bladet similarly crap. Ditto tabloids reest world. 

I can't say understand *why* Swedish Finnish tabloids high quality journalism mixed usual trash, pretty cool imo! gets real news audience go seeking own. feels like equalizing force healthy democracy. Trudeau handing Trump election? sTaBLe GeNiUs automated think copy pasted likely And? Considering result herd immunity, vaccine, seems suggest treatments COVID-19 become much better. shows ""front loading"" deaths killed many people unnecessarily.

Or shows restrictions working, peak mortality mid-April, roughly 3 weeks restrictions enacted. Remember takes time actions effect due time takes someone infected actually dies disease.

I would say one main issues Swedish strategy acted late. High schools universities closed earlier, social distancing working home promoted earlier etc. problem FHM waited community spread confirmed additional time anything let's forget ICU admissions controlled criteria used prioritise access beds - many people simply denied treatment ICU. ICU numbers meaningless.

If many denied ICU, surely would shown death toll? reality, ICU admission daily deaths follow similar curve. reason prioritise currently, lots spare capacity (IIRC around 30% free capacity majority people currently ICU non-COVID One question... I'm sure want share good news... get data hospitalisation? FHM data contains ICU admissions. another source find hospitalisation data?

Personally, use lot. shows hospitalizations, confirmed cases, ICU deaths. also lot statistics. [SVT's (state media) also pretty good.

Speaking sites, also recommend shows number deaths clear way, also gives good view reporting lag affects numbers. note however prediction uses purely data-driven model, therefore bit inaccurate.

Quick vocabulary:

* IVA = ICU (or specifically, respirator)
* På sjukhus = Currently hospital
* Fall = Cases

As data gathered different sources different ways, note different sites may show somewhat different numbers. big differences, though. Never reopened indoor seating restaurants. bars. known highest risk activities. air one wearing earplugs goggles. Eyes ears mucous membranes Sure would. reliable tracker gives information Landkreis Bundesland Germany? family friends NRW. agree people need stay home social distance. said, entirety NYC 214,061 cases, 55,173 26% resulted hospitalizations. Texas currently 97,433 active cases, put percent hospitalizations(it different every state), 26% 97,433 around 25,000 hospitalizations. Texas 80,000 hospital beds entire state. 

We would triple number hospitalizations reach actual peak capacity. 


I’m saying isn’t possible, IMO it’s highly unlikely ever approach numbers. Remember, we’re animals site's death data using? That's exactly doing. districts often states want tell parents hard truth patents want here. often elected members keep mind.

So gambling opening schools, hoping everything turns fine, closing public's opinion shifts simply claiming following electorate. bullshit people making decisions responsibility read familiarize credible evidence, average American parent obligation, Twitter Facebook good enough. wise beyond years, young lady.

Albertans history screwing blaming liberals.

There's lesser support Saskatchewan &amp; BC. Can't find numbers imagine *much* lesser, especially BC. Mexico money way rich countries. strategy they're using risky, based science. closer Sweden did.

Every Canadian upset this.

Ha ha ha hahahahahah. Who's joke now? sound like really fun parties man damn liberal Abbott deep state. literally entire point article. Distance doesn’t matter you’re room infected person.

Politically feel like two states smushed together distance bc/Alberta Ontario/Quebec/maritimes much people want hear it, money come rich. 

In March, government handed $10 billion stock market, another $10 billion banks backed another $1 trillion ""needed"" it.

During lockdowns, vast sums wealth transferred pockets via governments (ie., tax payers money) stock markets, banks big businesses small businesses decimated millions made unemployed. 

The governments taking rich give poor - exact opposite, nobody even questioning they're distracted covid fear porn cycle media blasting 24/7. call virus sharing zones honest. Seeing stuff incredibly short term antibodies really makes feel like won’t ever end someone US I’ve never heard anyone refer holiday “bank holiday”. I’ve lived country. People say banking hours federal holiday bank holiday. quick google search shows UK term US.  all!! contacted every consulate (American consulates Finland Finnish consulates America), Finnish American embassies, school, border guards, everyone. Nobody wants responsibility letting in. agency says think allowed in, nobody actually write letter show airport. worst part possible get visas residence permits right now. consulate offices closed (you reach email, cant go in) possible ""biometric data collection appointments"" fancy talk fingerprint scan. outsourcing it, companies fingerprint testing fee reputable. even post offices. even Federal government. seems reason shut chances getting visa consulate offices closed. pretty ridiculous. 

I'm starting see news articles going around saying Europe thinking opening people romantic partners coming countries. pretty cool might help get in, since long time partner Finland. still bugs though, EU considering allowing people say ""oh yeah partner there"" accept mountain evidence rightful student Finland paid apartment European health insurance everything. feels little silly. almost ships, absent military, plain old turbo diesel burning bunker oil. that's tankers, containers, RoRo auto transport, etc.

Some ferries diesel electric.

Smaller, say &lt; 250 ft might plain diesel fuel. 

Even military vessels like frigates destroyer turbine engines LM2500 burning diesel like distillate them. live tried explain people, Wexit crowd literally stupidest people I've ever met. even worth breath. Misread instructions:

for all. read article. Here: weird Sweden seemingly Nordic country provide citizens access major newspapers online though library though. hardly believe caase, guess everything I've learned dysfunctional Sweden surprised anymore. 

If can't discuss group traits, cannot discuss reality. example: Swedish government knows Swedish people are, group, likely follow rules obedient recommendations. disagree that? literally one key foundational aspects Swedish strategy. 

We data proving less right. 

So stereotype Swedes follow rules proven right situation, less. 

Without able discuss this, can't discuss key part reality.  knew girl who's sister flew home Florida July 4th. father boyfriend's parents medical issues. Despite that, still flew even quarantine. I’m saying isn’t issue. considering 20-25% deaths US normally happen nursing homes, 40% doesn’t seem like much bump respiratory pandemic dangerous older sicker people, especially hospitals don’t normal capacity.

What percent flu deaths happen nursing home, normal year? 33% said wont get it? choice. Rest country reopening cave in, would ignored. Public tired lockdown BLM happened going back. Basically BLM end stay home Yes. WeChat popular. TikTok place quality cringe content. current government team creates ""easily consumable"" propaganda messages targeted towards Muslims minorities. 

Also messages show government wonderful light hiding nasty shit doing. Think email SMS chain messages used get, far sinister capable destroying fabric society . Holy Shit! never even thought this. going go tell friends explain behavior.

My son goes small school (200 kids preschool 6th grade) keeping kids groups 10 cross contact. staff entirely masked, kids spend half day outdoors. 

He started summer session today, percentage local population Covid small right now, likely increase August. decided less risky go now, even less students school. 

Will devestated forever blame anything happens? Yes. could say thing died car accident driving, fell died playing outside supervising him. 

My point parents individually decide benefits outweigh risks. Headlines like article make small risks seem bigger. Low deaths... studies right now. maybe anymore. That's science. best play leader crisis. That’s he’s trailing 13 points polls. aren’t enough freedom loving anti mask people carry reelection. He’s running intuition intuition failing (and us).

This false. reason Electoral College created appease slave states, join otherwise. Southern slave states high percentage population slaves vote considered people, created problem elections! 3/5 compromise allowed counted people purposes counting population, increased number electors states received without actually free black slaves. 

Mostly Founding Fathers talked Electors free factional politics Washington, could better informed voters, would free foreign interference - big thing because, know, Britain. 

They also assumed mostly system *wouldn't* produce winner, election would turn decided House Representatives. also time winner electoral votes would president 2nd place would Vice President.

The proponents Electoral College often confuse concept *rights* minority cannot trampled majority, *elections* majorities. That’s democracy 101. Wuuuut's feel like shoe foot there, lololol?

The depressing thing think go right back bad decision weeks cases exploding. safe states lock back down, damaging economy, virus still spread people traveling throughout country.

False statement. incomplete ongoing. mixed. 

That quite natural since research takes hotly debated Ebola, SARS, Swine Flu breakouts well,

Different diseases. Irrelevant empty can't ethically run actual experiment measure actual airborne transmission would require intentionally infect people virus.

Thats mindbogglingly stupid. need infect people run experiments airborne transmissions. guesses often fall apart peer review.

Not guesses actual experiments.

And fall apart peer review. False incoherent statement. studies dont pass peer review, dont. Happens studies common thread among laypeople includes political leaders, media Redditors lack critical thinking lack understanding statistics.

Im guessing means one lay people. lol. special. veritable messiah truth facts. see headline simply believe it, absent evidence context, everyone gets echo chamber.

Thats exactly doing. believe virus already extremely widespread, 25-50% population, hospitalization fatality rate 10-100x less currently estimated, focused 80% elderly pre-existing conditions, already begun fade severity.

You havent watched news lately, eh? Or, likely, longer even able see whatever contradicts ""beliefs"". adjusting population thAt'S chINeSe sPyWarE Source? That's pretty big claim. Might playing chicken venue. oil costs nothing now, continue give shit great day Canada medical setting somehow different? masks filter viruses, viruses small. 

Since mentioned epidemiologist, heres quote one:

""""It's really unhealthy wear mask prolonged periods collects bacteria bacteria proliferate,"" said Colin Furness, epidemiologist University Toronto. ""And warmer moist environment is, happier bacteria Especially since companies forcing employees customers sign waivers giving right sue get Covid.

At point, there's benefit even acknowledging Covid threat. loose workers? There's enough disposable bodies waiting hired.   bit six minutes in. Washington post. Good enough? Laos well, lot countries like Mongolia Vietnam getting imported cases point.

It’s risk lives feed families absolutely income One joke today I’ve seen 4 different articles 4 different teams players COVID. MLB season haven’t even started yet. Sounds like might able bargain. bullshit pulled though, might well try tack sizeable hazard pay along mandatory masks. 

Every place treats people way. love money greed. Poor people trying tell everyone decades they're treated like commodities, nobody listened they're underpaid essential workers benefits really shitty benefits. career restaurants, one day said fuck it, looked available job openings restaurant southern US, saw starting $3/hr plus tips said fuck again. 

To honest, I'm surprised professors feeling though. Well here's thing - everyone room would tested beforehand Trump could put show needing masks.

So would setting bad example 50k cases day regular people. Let’s see. 12 studies say antibodies last extended period time. One study says don’t. Hmm believe.  Sorry... mom lives AZ, warning COVID-19 back January, staying home early February. it’s July seems like she’s still one people taking seriously there. Apparently hardly anyone wears masks still people pretend doesn’t exist. Grow brain. check joy face husband hearing gonna arrested:

 Thank you, Trudeau.  I’ve put shit ton muscle enjoying time outside. I’ve benefitted immensely. don’t know much blacks AIDS. wasn’t aware correlation outside Africa. can’t comment happens. prevalence high among blacks gays?

I never hear gay people forced promiscuous. forces that?  Governor care much COVID spreads many people infected. believes fatality rate low stay low. state OPEN stay open, matter what. clearly double standards regarding restrictions liberties. know even Germany curfew Bundesländer? 10pm? One biggest beer consuming countries world? postponed indoor dining still increased. unaware studies mask usage based self reporting. point polls suffer biases, people tend overestimate normative behavior. instance, people generally overestimate much exercise given period time. cannot say people US definitively wearing masks based YouGov survey. Personally, think sizable contingent wears masks least time. wear time. also widespread anti-mask movement reduces mask usage sudden uptick coronavirus cases would suggest masks social distancing measures followed. study needed topic reach reliable data.  Canada. recent study Ontario found 83% Covid-19 deaths long term care homes facilities run private sector, despite proportion private sector public sector homes equal. 5 worst performing private sector care homes quickly taken back direct municipal control ensure safety residents.

Instead Boris pointing fingers private sector, rise successive Conservative governments encouraged, act protect residents changing system put care ahead profit. Following Ontario government would good start.  Death rate constantly declining increased cases - effect expanded testing... NAFTA 2: Electric Boogaloo Ja! suck nation. 👍 proven vaccine works. didn’t say government already taking money rich, said happening  occidental


Is native language Spanish? actually get that. I'm actually married researcher PHD pharm/tox. even works one research buildings covid vaccine researchers. keeps stuff better do. that's definitely view it.

My point keep seeing articles like this: make sound hopeless. would think pre-mature push headlines first group folks gets twice. think that's happened yet. data tells survey respondent replied question, actual state affairs is, no? 

If surveyed everyone Salt Lake City drunk alcohol engaged homosexual activity last year would get almost 100% ""No"" answers despite fact way everyone Salt Lake City straight sober last year. think point getting drunk sign someone bad.

Your response really mean anything. No, everyone handle alcohol well **that mean one can** which, since parent made blanket statement drunks, clearly point person responding trying make. Right?? Especially clotting factors discovered associated COVID-19. pregnant woman increased risk DVT is, 100-fold increased risk first week postpartum. That, combined flu information, brainer saying pregnant women would likely higher risk complications. shit Sherlock... answer protecting jail exposure? ""trouble"" mean $$$$ (as clearly called article) hate say told so. Yeah they’re super smart followed science right? get common sense see what’s going world stop believing first thing see research yourself. renamed Bright House reason. weekend... actually proof going office everyday significant drain people's mental health quality life. neat TBH Thai living BKK, probably best now, satisfied already.

Back Feb-Apr, lived fear infection. worst nearly half family members health care workers role prone infection. teared apart family need moved house need sperate bedroom his/her partner sacrifice sake parents. Even still stayed apart precautions.

Now even though seen local infections month now, still wear masks public. However longer living fear. traffic Bangkok congested AF now. People afraid meet eat out. restaurant business survive. Tho tourism industry take severe hit, manufacturing halt there.

So relative 3 months ago rest world, pretty sure happy status quo now. tried discovering oil coveted natural resources New York? U.S. government might start paying attention you. probably don’t get Canadian updates US. whenever Trudeau update, comes mask waits everyone far enough away taking off. Everyone else keeps on. 

Then compare Trump 20 people come unmasked shoulder shoulder. Without reading all: Germany, companies protect employees law! pandemic: masks - business. lockdowns smart Resellers sold stored face masks back Asia impossible get weeks. Right big companies good contacts China able import masks, restarted business. remember Covid-19 rising, bosses said would influence business. days after: ""the health safety employees comes first!"". Yes, placebo effect, also keep droplets away others faces. Well, think made good social distancing staying home. reason still use electoral college didn’t would mean Texas California New York would states matter due population size leaving 47 states without voice comes presidential election. purpose allow states proper vote comes runs country. reason it’s needed European countries population size much smaller, closer together. Let’s say Europe one country former country state. countries would need equal voting power rather countries majority population controlling who’s power. make sense? right. noticed correlation mobility number cases. keep posting it. people keep arguing reason USA cases didn’t shut long hard enough.

I would hesitant declare “lockdown period” re-opening still happening, least am. pretty steady climb mobility since deepest point “lockdown” That's prediction awhile. red stay red, blues stay blue, battlegrounds win red enough. Special? special. I'M SPECIAL. BIT TEN MINUTES AGO [I'M Cruel Unusual Punishment gotta tell man, it’s pretty sweet! Phoenix send next? ""we'll get together over"" new favorite saying catch covid? thanks want thank every American great job reaching milestone. haters said USA would never number 1 anything besides national debt prison population, proved wrong! tried explain Japanese friend public health experts politicians said mass gatherings/protests okay pandemic, racism, truly understand. thought issue English.

???

You know risk outdoor transmission masked people rare, right? Otherwise we'd seeing huge spikes NY cities large protests occurred, seeing any. Oh yikes looked derogatory slur. bad thank letting know Canadians smug. It’s bad news cause get sick start covid unit next week. I'm loving ""lockdown"" (it's quotes actually locked never been). I'm way, way less stressed working home, wife. lunch together every day, spend lunch time watching TV instead sitting phone office kitchen awkwardly trying make smalltalk coworkers. never feel like need go things weekends, relax watch movies evenings.

Even considering that, I'd jump joy vaccine found tomorrow. I'd stoked US actual coordinated response this, gotten virus control. There's tons stuff miss doing, there's tons stuff I'm planning moment safe. Publicly declining white house visit unheard Canada. big FU toddler charge US. Thank responding me. Even though know HIV insertions added make infectious. 
Here different 3:25 mark guess doesn’t end you. poster said it’s common phase. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* link laboratory setting nothing actual virus infecting people. also ""pseudovirus"" lacking infectious genes HIV used study coronavirus enters cells without perform experiments BSL3 facility.

Here review discussing pseudovirus I'll copy important part 

 

""A pseudovirus recombinant viral particle core/backbone envelope proteins derived different moreover, genes inside pseudovirus usually altered modified unable produce surface protein own. such, additional plasmid stable cell line expressing surface proteins needed make capable infecting susceptible cells, replicate 1 round infected host Compared wild‐type (WT) viruses, pseudoviruses safely handled biosafety level (BSL)‐2 usually easier manipulate Nevertheless, conformational structure pseudoviral surface proteins bears high similarity native viral proteins, surface proteins effectively mediate viral entry host cells.

tl;dr: Trump one-trick pony.   I’m it. Telemedicine greatly expands provider choice, access healthcare rural locations, reduces number people waiting room, relieves lot anxiety people face getting help begin with. Fewer trips ER get call physician deal minor issues phone. that, me, giving up. allow people voice sitting back making jokes it, course they’ll gain influence.

I didn’t realize thinking bad taste now. many, definite numbers back up? debate likelihood occuring. like measles sharing car someone would *likely* infect you?  report less weekend *wonder, outbreak Ok Germany curfew states right COVID. Sounds good me!

 general Sweden land rules rules rules frankly bizarre see go ""eh whatever, big dangerous pandemic uh guess wash hands something maybe stay distance away people something?"" route.

No one intellectually honest thinks Sweden somehow FREEDOMS paradise generally tremendous amount silly rules. Even many pro-Swedish strategy posters acknowledge simply part reality. said unthinkable things already happening, backwards. best skill PR. cabinet full questionable appointments know graduate students university Canadian city US still US plates vehicles. hopeful since postponed Disneyland reopening canned college program Disney World foreseeable future. guess shouldn’t surprised though company barely pays park workers enough forces movie divisions make crappy sequels remakes pushing ahead though pursuit dollar. Antibodies last forever types immunity takes over, already evidence good cell response: "" Robust cell immunity convalescent individuals asymptomatic mild COVID-19"" It’s protests ok.  It’s issue police flagrantly killing people - disproportionately targeting blacks abuse - issue worth dying putting risk pandemic.  fairness, also pretty bad public education system. going 40 years. Making people less able use critical thinking skills avoid echo chambering themselves. saying wrong, agree you, can't blame mental health reason USA explosion cases. Really wish candidate running Pres Election. feel confident would get straightened out. (No I'm NY). care. born parents moved five. Used rain 70s even early 90s . drought. newbies understand especially metro city areas. Turn tap water care. Sort like meat comes grocery store people. magically happens. Horse. Barn door. know rest. Yeah, middle-aged man beaten senseless trying job. tragic, hope perpetrated punished severely made example of. way prevent happening again. Yeah really. Politicians supposed experts, they're supposed put ideas action. politician becomes leader, job surround competent experts listen to. governor blocked mayor requiring masks lockdown. allowed it.  vast majority people properly wearing masks. crappy surgical masks little people social distancing yelling, singing, chanting.

NY see huge spikes, huge % population already infected exposed. disaster waiting happen. Everyone see coming. Disney fucking greedy right now. Dollars lives.

When they're eventually forced close down, inundated lawsuits (assuming make sign coronavirus waiver enter park), watch inevitable perfunctory, ""No one could seen coming."" wasn’t working home schedule strict usual office hours, would absolutely loved it. many things could gotten accomplished. never hear gay people forced promiscuous. forces that?

The social rejection denies long term relationships. prevalence high among blacks gays?

Don't know offhand, would think could google that. anyone know got hit hard? data, got link them? powerlifting/hypertrophy program pre covid switch 52 lb dumbells 3 months. thought lifts going awful going back gym pulled 495 DL first day back, 525 lockdown. bad 3 months. could get back previous lifts pretty quickly. things ramping im going gym less. Getting covid much worse lifting dumbbells home. like scene Arrival, they'll send canary white house first see drops dead seem know lot superspreader stuff. percentage infections believe directly caused superspreader events? Also, regarding Influenza, spread via air droplets well? read R0 Flu lower current Coronavirus, would one explain rampant H1N1 1918? I'd definitely send kids back school parent 50 health conditions kid really messed up. Per CDC 29 instances kid 15 dying Covid lower flu demo.

 

&amp;#x200B;

The long term side effects socially beheind worse covid risk kids. Prevalence high controlled test, trace, isolate. solution total, enforced lockdown least 90 days, break back exponential curve. didn’t way. don’t spirit will. government failed us profound fundamental way. immunity turns short lived, United States going face continuous rolling outbreak nature compromises virus. beginning see disease apartheid system taking place. R-publican states locked basically.

Sooner later, run PPE. HCW become exhausted begin desert. People go lockdown themselves. Hard times coming. Eh he’s 60s he’s rich he’ll probably live 90s thirty years  governor right kill people mayors sweet FA stop them. 

I'd resign me. Whew! Luckily 100k+ surplus deaths likely flu actually covid, relief. Plague, game, realistic Instagram comments section bonkers. Last looked people claiming put death Australia COVID coverup SNL appearance deepfake. 

One parents’ friends got swept Q shit it’s funny internet really sad real life, he’s isolated everyone cared he’s deep conspiracies. ""nah I'm good, eh."" That's actually basically started, look back. he's explicit geniuses blindly downvoting. Try Google next time, took 3 seconds find article stating referring. wouldn’t sign shit. work started taking people’s temps last week course thermometer reads 95.4 every person every day. anyone twitter thread link doc w/e explaining seeing lag deaths? trying explain going see multiple NYC's coming weeks. definitely perfect world describing dystopian nightmare. /s data they're concerned bottom line. potentially crowded indoor areas without air circulation — like non-air conditioned public transit, example — Furness suggests wearing mask duration ride taking get back outdoors. Imagine good it’s going feel see cases decreasing every day finally none realize tourism also brings loads money countries carribean south/central america right? Hmmmmm. Cruel unusual punishment?🤔 Trump insistent COVID harmless. really think got virus, publisizing every opportunity? know he's downvoted either - fear denial play big role virus.

In case, though, think matter ego - ""you can't tell do"". 😟 conversation every time watch real estate show. playing Russian roulette people's lives. Also walk gaping arse. I've told disparaging tones disease vector.  insensitive people getting sick have/been trying best avoid it. Sometimes it’s inevitable, every confirmed case people partying packed bars beaches. long answer: humans become complacent. human dumb. Missed huge opportunity call CUM. LOL, turned invitation totally concerns Covid. LOL. good job blocking source mask, need goggles, etc. means, call dude. see point trying reclaim label.

What America? country built chattel slavery, wage slavery, sociopathic individualism? I'm sure there's something worth saving there, personal loyalty country sorely tested past four (twelve) (twenty) years, malignant pro-pandemic bullshit put label altogether.  entire post political lmao hell. Delete post , cant avoid politics post Trump Trudeau centered. one, many more. Manitoba friends constantly share wexit stuff. like first, Manitoba isn’t invited, second ever happened damage country economy would catastrophic. would worst thing possible Canadian...but Blame Federal Government. jumped masks work bandwagon since beginning January/February/March time period. still friends different parts Canada still think masks albeit needed part government bit, due constant mixed messages. months ago, fairly educated friend mine literally say concerned getting sinus infection Coronavirus. 56.

Their lower number cases compared countries seem reinforced views. However remind part Feds essentially closing whole country months. case numbers reflective virus running amok. feeding bias. 

The Feds made 180° last month half, so. However, due perhaps higher public education Canadians culturally less self-centered general. topic masks politicized highly ignored USA. So, people likely agree usage. Keeping numbers lower. cases 1000% deaths stayed relatively flat? 

  California coronavirus outlook worsened holiday weekend, hospitalizations continued rise counties added Sunday Gov. Gavin Newsom’s COVID-19 watch list

Hear that, coronavirus? Governor Newsom's put notice. He's got eye you. *the list*. better shape get California, else. Yes, thank mentioning this. I'll add childcare/nanny industry would somehow magically expand manyfold make meaningful dent need closing schools produce.  get that, believe that. mentioned another comment below, I'm married researcher degree pharm/tox. immunologist, far off. 

Yet media pushes articles like make immunity sound impossible: would think dire man says, we'd seeing second cases now. Trump COVID invited Trudeau pass blame Trudeau giving say manners realize Canadian sarcasm unlike other. 

You hear unless Canadian experience. Since cleanliness important don’t want risk unsanitary conditions hospitals, volunteers corps duty? NYC inmates digging mass graves last spike, volunteers?

It good joke, wear pride. holy crap didnt realize 51 years old. face looks incredibly fake must ton botox. seems like something would get stuck on, honestly. think you’ve helped understand forming opinion. still don’t agree views masks, helps. Thanks! forget Trudeau started pandemic working home self isolation wife covid-19 ""Denying Covid really advancing virus"", said Cuomo. Airborne medical -technical sense means tiny, ‘raw’ virus float air without saliva mucus microdroplets around it.  might get sneezed out, settle surface wet, moisture evaporates, dried virus capable swept back air disturbance, infect people breath in.  also known ‘Aerosolized’ virus. Yes, know. wonder protect aerosol transfer... it’s certainly believable one best first aid antiseptics kills everything mouth protects contact based transfer.... translates risk infection dental / hair salon setting matters more. never heard PR? Certainly for-profit company cynical reasons. They'll make money one way another. It’s much harder kids lol got lucky mine, least far. hit middle HS, probably wouldn’t work! Marble racing ESPN2 now?

EDIT: Yes, answered another comment. works customers dead. can't sell drugs dead people, specifically kills people chronic illnesses. Seems like solid experimental evidence showing air based transmission COVID-19. *very* predictable. numbers in. 99.9% young people either asymptomatic mild symptoms. outliers change statistics.

Full shutdowns keeps hospitals curve, unskilled service workers take hit instead.  Wow seem pleasant. know words president ever. Oh read thinking Trudeau secret ulterior motive. Empathy compassion leadership good see right now. reason smart Americans pretend Canadian travelling abroad.

While understand people terrible reputation lot countries, think part way combat bad reputation first place would let people know American, polite kind possible. considerate people's spaces, start changing idea we're overly boisterous, rude, self-centered. Like every demographic, way combat negative stereotypes people personally know people group way. probably always considered ""too friendly"" countries - that's Americans interact - rude, egotistical stereotype negative we've got try change it. way better job articulating getting at. read announcement mayor correct. Financial Times interesting graphs excess deaths various countries page: said, current cases much younger (35 now, compared 65 April), milder cases captured due expanded testing capacity, treatments much better (hospitalized death rates 1/4th April, according report England), think deaths stay low unless hospitals get seriously overwhelmed. politics. politic people he's always sided say virus big deal, masks necessary, peddle conspiracies meant make virus hoax. 

He either 

a) Admits people wrong thus fallible, meaning accept may also wrong/fallible/a sucker

or

b) reject reality alongside them. Oooh somebody desperate validation! LMAO Yes room board probably bigger concern colleges, that's true. Cuomo final say, SUNY confident want every university country part planning same. end Cuomo said colleges opening semester person classes. says yes would confident happening least plan contingencies. Lichdom person. Seriously, look fucking Chuck Grassley try tell ritualistically stored soul phylactery rule forever.

So yeah powerful antiseptic mouth reduces viral load mouth. exactly groundbreaking IMO, also use antiseptic (bleach, peroxide, alcohol) similar manner. difference going boil safety side effects each.


(BTW, PVP-I mouthwash already product used used dental infections on. It’s recommended dosage usage 4x day, suggests doesn’t last long time)  lol anyone thinks Trump careful anyone else alive regardless mask (I'd almost iota respect actually care put money mouth mingle crowds!)... he's terrified, everyone around tested regularly (and apparently gets super angry people around test positive) acts like care narrative followers legit care virus bet he's paranoid live maskless bubble testing. knows gets virus game especially serious politically age shitty way handled want exist pretending doesn't. ironic cares much health, best thing people wear masks knows want draw attention virus wants everyone shift focus ""radical left"" he's hoping riots statues stuff keep going election. people keep talking virus failures regard keep focus. result he's putting everyone else risk even though he's probably going fine punishment jail time infection deadly disease. Anyone believes ""they got deserved"" believe justice rule law.

Also, jealous means think someone *else*, again, doubt would happen. slam full throttle vaccine. We'll keep are, virus rampaging multiple states, countries finally developed vaccine we'll use never bother anything interim. Hey guys. thing help keep economy open go lock territory? Let's it. Like fought war somehow sides lost. going see posts regarding care package canadian government sends people covid-19 like south korea brainwash people going south korea? 

maybe see posts regarding universal healthcare canada. Well, seems derived genetically modified animals - far know that's usually long process. also show works without long-term side effects, Get approved wide use, someone else figure make mass quantities.

This something feel good turns right. good thing come competent leadership next virus strikes. That's thing? could also say open-up protestors MUCH smaller groups, much better spaced average. duration protests much shorter well. Also, can't cherry pick part protests like. Floyd protests involved violent showdowns police mostly masked, well looting stores means people inside masks.  sounds like typical comment section /r/science. Wow, sounds horrendous. Could hear room time? Telemedicine positive coming don’t know people didn’t push sooner. appointment doctors anywhere state New York. sitting waiting room everyone coughing. don't, they've rare occasion provided security abroad important Canadians (such diplomat Lieutenant-Governor). [RCMP Protective Policing provides security Prime Minister, among others. pretend head state loser degenerate furry? much freedom unfettered people fixated superficial freedoms fundamental freedom.

In epidemic pandemic, need constantly remind one basic freedoms right safe one's physical person, or, put bluntly, right remain alive. fundamental freedom taken away us others behave way puts bodies lives risk. US response awful protests aren’t bad terms pandemic response. outside daylight hours, wearing mask - protesters wore masks - pretty much safest aren’t sheltering home.

Most protesters properly wear masks. Also, giant gatherings -- tear gas -- almost every big U.S. city. certainly spiked infected numbers people quietly drinking beer inside bar. Brain dead = killed. Unrecoverable state mind, empty husk. hopefully classified murder. long invite covid house, good!! Masks required city today.

For places masks mandated, people generally follow it? FTW? Best ama week, would recommend 8/6 I'm clarinetist.

You forgot part effective treating virus 2 months ago. Michigan basically already peaked we're coming down, Florida setting records daily confirmed cases. surprised little notice people dying street rich suburban backyard.. people someone who's vulnerable close die they'll actually care course will. open, people go. claim systematic problem really anything support notion. Sure there's cases people treated poorly, really terrible, that's due crappy individuals, general consensus Swedish population. people really react seeing someone mask, might stare bit, expected appearance diverges norm. numbers game really, interact enough people bound run shitbag, likely happened cases. improved treatment find ECMO, supposedly better ventilators. Maybe vitamin since summer? Although spike ""pneumonia"" deaths smells fishy me... almost like deaths really going much saying. two peas pod. Hey. Go. cracked back molar weeks ago. Didn’t want go in, made apt anyway. dentist told I’d need crown maybe root canal, I’d lose tooth. didn’t enough PPE get in. 

So went another dentist. Described it, got emergency patient. Within week, given temporary crown, root canal, permanent crown. feel good new, I’m going back soon yearly checkup. 

Go could seriously lose tooth. way knowing unless look first. Stay calm don’t cry afraid, need take care yourself.  that. Quit corporate job decade ago selling possessions saving up.

Where from?

Have Sweden?

Have met Swede?

How old education? Stop. stop. news Florida February 2021. completely blockade state military cut satellite feeds communications. definitely heart Disney developed new magic technologies eradicate virus within certain areas? limit spots parks?


Even works small radius, sell tech hospitals, schools, public transportation, etc? haven’t read article, I’ll take wild guess Irish Times reporting Ireland. they're BLM protestors tho /s complex that. 

So first body natural protections foreign particles. skin example big one. Someone sneezes particle virus lands leg, nothing going happen unless touch leg rub eyes. virus protein lipid barrier living organism cannot sustain itself; hours sun it'll break become inert. 

A second layer cilia nostrils. grab onto particles larger air molecules hang onto them, preventing going lungs. 100% effective course, stop tiny things getting in.

Once inside body, virus latch onto cell body knows decode protein load. every cell body know virus; nothing decays becomes inert. 

That's large load virus leads infection small loads. viral particles are, chances virus getting past defenses finding cell compatible with. finds cell, body decodes viral DNA own; cell reproduce virus you. 

Your immune system kicks then. overwhelmed large viral load, can't help. one two cells, body tends find way kill move things normally. hate say danger now, certainty daddy buyer.  American would say this. need addressed, giant protests address systemic racism pandemic banned. Americans lucky Trump that. Free market death liberty! disappointing, I'm surprised anymore. Americans large coddled ""customer always right"" mentality. politicians tell whatever want hear get elected, representation (white middle class above) insulate diversity human suffering suburbs. We've armed conflict Middle East nearly two decades, nobody experienced much toilet paper shortage COVID hit. think could, does, happen anywhere - remove people concept sacrifice. they're left imaginary quarrels petty grudges minor inconveniences. forget American way comes price, they've never pay it. said, plenty Americans work hard struggle, voice political process. think post downvoted explanation anti-mask attitudes fit simplistic ""us vs them"", ""left vs right"" narrative that's popular reddit.

People want blame specific group people anti-mask attitudes, suggesting said attitudes actually come universal human frailties goes idea. People pretty loose relaxed restrictions least since two months back now. think increasing immunity driving force behind decrease hospitalised patients deaths. one become part electoral college? [The Electoral College — CGP good job explaining it. works me! buy it? 16 new deaths since when? Sonoma County 6 last week, even one harder hit areas. Cases surge hospitalizations surge deaths surge. 

Hospitalizations started surge. 

The deaths surge. It’s matter if. matter science matter belief.  Right. then, places making mandatory wear times public spaces? wear 8 hours day work? know new research new news. honestly think waiting go ahead reporting. look around little more... Someone else right saying it. post update find more. Source? curious, last saw 100m end 2020.  /u/peachykeen08 September, Ouch! stubbed fucking toe! bullshit! can't believe this, could day get wors- Oh... comment wrote Reddit never complaining again... Meh, fuck it, pandemic now, plenty regular shit complain it. Nah, OP wasnt invited Serious question, spectrum?  Eeeeexactly. warning friends co-workers northern states experiencing others (FL, CA, TX, AZ, etc.) truly get prepared next couple months.

When cold arrives everyone shuts doors windows keep heat inside, that’s I’m concerned about. see virus states heavily rely AC summer... come winter, assume spread happen easily quickly snowy states. don’t know winter bring, it’s never bad idea prepared, case. sucks charged $80 video call 5 minutes told nothing’s wrong though. 

Also, service use prescribe 3 days worth prescription state. Pretty useless every prescription we’ve ever used house. Except French passengers drivers Pretty sure 99.9% people disabilities would want masks. would far risk others depending disability. Smart. he? Costco’s got high standards, lol. time start seasonal worker, prove worth, wait full-time position open up.

But yeah, gap year definitely way would go incoming freshmen. Brazil electoral college 1) Brazil nobody cares 2) thank god electoral colleges nothing like American ones. believe name. delegates anything like this. electoral college place vote (elections domicile) home address know go vote (our elections always Sundays). couple weeks! omg! sounds like every nasty cold flu. Pretty sure first *confirmed* COVID case Michigan March 10th. BoJo's fiance it. Trudeau. know. We've seen happens uses Twitter. careful wish for.

Systemic Racism. Another way saying past capacity. 1039 code arrest. Yes. Someone linked video target arrest. recorded both.

Mexican president still head state. invited ""a head state"". technically OP still correct. means 60% lost weight go back study say keeping try imply says, wearing mask unless know sick

Coronavirus pre-symptomatic phase many carriers asymptomatic. would know wear mask? That's epidemiologists say wear mask.

Again, epidemiologist. continually misrepresented epidemiologists studies cite. Stop. COVID-19 deaths inside New York nursing homes stemmed infected workers visitors introducing coronavirus vulnerable facilities, new state Department Health report asserted Monday.  
  report also contended controversial Health Department order March 25 directing nursing homes admit COVID-19 positive patients hospitals limited impact outbreaks.  
  shows nursing home residents got COVID-19 staff presumably visited them,"" Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said press briefing report.  
  said many COVID-19 outbreaks nursing homes caused unchecked community asymptomatic spread prior March 25 order, citing national delays identifying pandemic threat ramping testing February March.  
  ""Unfortunately, understand disease early on,"" said, adding virus spreading New York state banned nursing home visitors March 13.    long-awaited Health Department report came amid mounting calls state federal lawmakers independent investigation COVID-19 deaths New York nursing homes. 
      report Monday independent: crafted released Health Department.  Please invite Boris Johnson, please invite Boris Johnson.......

I sure would go. 1039 code arrest false alarm. Sounds pretty similar US, then. get fired, laid off, contract ends. lost job due shutdown, get then, too, assuming get unemployment site load nearly impossible moment. understand exactly leading example.

During heart COVID-19 pleading people visit family members celebrate easter without physically together visiting cottages, it.

Lots people rationalize exemptions follow guidelines specific situation literally leader country one people reinforcing mindset ""The rules apply people because...""

A better leader would said ""My cottage nearby wife apart, isolate Easter there's reason can't."" Same... strange thermometer reads everyone 96 degree range 99% time.  are, though? Yes, glad see Hamburg shut suggestion quickly. Hamburg brilliant city densely populated, would certainly madness drop mask requirement, especially given people complying it. I'm Berlin moment take subway last night first time months, idiots ignoring mask regulation, I'd say 80–90% complying. Karstadt today saw thing – odd maskless idiot, mostly compliant people. fix something broken? Um, something governor West Vitginia said months ago, trying sware. curiosity makes feel restrictions line? plenty restrictions public good (You can't get shitfaced drive, can't fire guns willy nilly city, can't use lead paint child's toys, can't dump toxic waste pond neighbourhood park etc...)

I'm worried next election cycle, I'm worried Trudeau's safety mean-time. Texas cases doubled past two weeks.. means another two weeks doubled again... again.. lockdown happens takes two weeks increase cases start slowing four deaths start slowing down. Good luck dumb ass logic. ok that's realistic  saying reopen restrictions. Masks given, cohorting limiting contact cross classroom teachers, too. Yeah, wonder many people think better. guilty. nearly flunked out! too, I'm really disappointed they've dropped ball entire thing. computer screen CT scanner. time health care student. lucky able gone back clinicals did. us licensed rad techs already. signed for. taking month off. wiped working 50+ weeks clinicals online classes top it. Yeah, seem produce small particles take CFR grain salt mostly. Antibody studies NY April NYC nearly 20% antibodies mid April. people infected March earlier. actual case numbers likely 10x higher.

Whatever Imagine thinking Trudeau ""extremist-left"". guess elected kkk representatives government, decent countries must seem radical. Look picture link above. case everywhere. even close. That's sea people. reality could 10% populations wear masks, Americans feel shittier admitting people surveyed UK, no? Good, every country Earth needs turn US. Make us learn. That’s article read said. test positive even donated plasma. TRAP! Yep another one notepad looks like normal healthy girl me? Sad hospital. screaming rooftops obesity probably one worst comorbidities COVID. Stop normalizing obesity. Hell, even Dubya plan. called obsession. Cheetodorito stopped funding 3 years ago! close levels homosexual 

What percentage homosexual men Covid-19 disproportionately high among Americans, people want blame behavior Americans instead looking social structure causes higher like sick leave example.


You think sick leave structures cause people following president? plain arrogance? see mean. devils advocate sort reply based title post haha guess placing priority list lower since already immunity. people higher list start get able get yourself. plausible sounds. COVID patients infective last couple days symptoms first couple after. Someone convalescing weeks now-active immune response, bedridden known sick way less effective spreader someone walking around facility normally. Right now, either good option. hahahaha.

So sick Covid. ""They're bringing disease. They're bringing COVID. They're sick. some, assume, healthy people."" Oh ok, thought maybe something concrete pointing reinfection based original comment. I've seen article bunch along lines, reinfection still thought likely case situations like thankfully. last minute vote switch? NDP never going support conservatives. I've heard using magnesium treat anxiety, need look that. Taking daily multivitamin, Vitamin D3, fish oil, clean diet, meditating exercising/running regularly immensely helped anxiety.  really are. Even believe majority good. seeing anomaly America hopefully corrected soon. Ikr? know want us talk pandemic, pandemic political despite mods think. said ok? Even without pandemic sketchy. would say no, dont over, thats talking. vast majority people properly wearing masks.

Says crappy surgical masks little people social distancing yelling, singing, chanting.

That's backed studies. Masks first 100 days (31 December 2019 8 April 2020), 961 COVID-19 patients diagnosed HKSAR. COVID-19 incidence HKSAR (129.0 per million population) significantly lower (p&lt;0.001) Spain (2983.2), Italy (2250.8), Germany (1241.5), France (1151.6), U.S. (1102.8), U.K. (831.5), Singapore (259.8), South Korea (200.5). compliance face mask usage HKSAR general public 96.6% (range: 95.7% 97.2%). observed 11 COVID-19 clusters recreational ‘mask-off’ settings compared 3 workplace ‘mask-on’ settings (p = 0.036 Chi square test see huge spikes, huge % population already infected exposed.

I suppose question this: willing risk contracting virus, potentially dying getting sick it, and/or spreading family friends party? missed point entirely. fully believe this. asshole stepdad deathbed like 15 years. think nice person, would closer 2 months. fucking asshole whole life, lived goddamn forever. needed laugh. Thank you. alive access best medical resource country. elders homes not. time vaccine safe take herd immunity. problem lot states already 3 month lockdowns, always states arent locked down.  think people refuse acknowledge point.

Thanks bro! yeah, honestly really bizarre. things zero smell all, things smell different. instance, can't smell orange juice.

Unfortunately, weed zero scent it. tastes like sugar cookie tho, can't even tell good not. Wow. work university we're going back campus vaccine gets developed herd immunity achieved.  


Is possible defer enrollment? least wait see fall goes. [The study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.11787) seems saying covid probably reported/misattributed excluded complicating pre-existing conditions, especially early on.

I'm sure article's title fair reflection that. Coronavirus polio... means cases (positive tests). perfect world always know exactly committed every crime, every person free access physical mental health services, one living desperate poverty, police actually trained handle situation without guns...

So imagination. disgusting thing say. ashamed yourself. They’re staying us. But, grandma excited get pictures together ugh. Smallpox vaccine live unattenuated vaccine still use, bit outlier.   time vaccine hits public, longer experimental. 

Imagine folks said polio vaccine came out.  call CAMUS. MUSCA. USMCA hard say. Right remember big goal reduce risk transmission low enough R &lt; 1. virus slows contained. Fail virus spreads exponentially. 6 ft might eliminate risk certainly lowers it. gets us closer goal. Spain pain?

And Florida, number tests performed daily late flat falling, 14% tests coming back positive — well recommended target 5%, state hitting nearly May.

Even national daily test positivity rate, 5% early June, started tick up, reaching 7.5% June 24, according COVID Tracking Project.” like 30 feet. great. imported cases really doesn’t matter, like countries, including Greenland, people coming in. lot countries much much worse.  think many people looking reason assure impacted COVID-19 get it. look pre-existing conditions like obesity, diabetes, asthma say ""see, COVID bad. preexisting conditions, I'll fine."" They're probably correct COVID kill them, course still know long term affects disease have, indications could lead long term lung damage even healthy people.

It also devalues lives people preexisting conditions, including things like obesity, diabetes, asthma, old age, country. people's lives worth less preexisting conditions good reason take COVID-19 seriously. spirit Alamo lives on..... inadvertently micro study herd immunity?

Our infections estimate includes infected individuals SARS-CoV-2 virus, took COVID-19 test tested positive. vast majority infected individuals estimates get tested, thus get reported positive case. July, estimate true number infected individuals US ~5x higher reported believe vaccine develop worked Sars never distributed SARS burned out. vaccine minor tweak vaccine developed quickly, already shown long term safety. Millions think politics stupid ask could give us accurate picture activities safer others. Thanks heads up! start checking. significant differences response Scotland England. example, next Friday, face coverings mandatory shops Scotland, England.

Have read this.  29 June, Scotland reported just 5 new cases, 815 UK whole, announced new covid-19-related deaths the fourth day row. nation could soon days new confirmed cases. “Scotland’s weeks away that,” says Sridhar. “England’s months away.” I’m sure, there’s Range Rover parked garage got arrested from. Patient testing positive agree opioid epidemic mental health problem country has, lady tearing display mental health issue? 

Or lacking formal education rooted science, logic, experience (versus alternative education)? Like there? 72% Americans believe Angel's exist 2016 Gallup poll? would think larger problem right getting supplies &amp; lab capacity. many states issue, employers likely well. put “No shoes, shirt, mask, service” category. Oh, see saying. policies specifically, though? would think policies (mask-wearing limiting large events come mind) would effective individual's decisions carry out, individual behavior would still good barometer. part disagree with?

In case obvious, I'm genuinely asking. know ton public policy Chinese restaurant mentioned lot restaurant case I've seen. worse case scenario seems. go. 


Notice word, patients. CASES, PATIENTS. Old people get sicker die quicker basically everything. We'll see ""untouchables"" really all, they're finally coming around softened bit. make sense thanks one knows they're full shit they're saying confidently. like think pretty good finding sources internet. better. Thanks. makes sense. guess end I’m conflicted go forward approach. Obviously wore mask would help, wish people did.

On one hand think shut again, feel like would adopt plan vaccine.

Or continue stay open, enforce stricter penalties businesses fail comply masks/social distancing, hope don’t become overwhelmed again. can't watch right (kid sleeping me) saying patient testing positive patient hospitalized? Lol. Fuck off. Correct. said ""potential"". Jury still one stay way early tell. One wish, occasion. majority time yeah, fortunate know individuals strive different ideals. look closely enough causes epidemic stupidity begin make may design- far many contributing factors diet media deny kind purpose behind all. 

I suppose sort hope cull may well beneficial end. would pain trade without US. path could take would ocean. good trade agreement, train could built US connect Canada Mexico.

So using US using US?

You can't say fuck US ask US hey take land, want build train it.

Whatever fuck smoking must good, cause I've awake twenty seconds see problem whatever shit idea thinking. wrong slightest Maybe American thing, salaries HEAVILY tied cost living. People present previously survivable conditions die. hospitality trade uk runs 10% profit margin. lose 50% occupancy/income, well see problem.

However know business cannot survive running loss, cash loss good chance easily replaced low paid front line life lost/Covid sickness.

Low wager virus profit back normal?

HMMM wonder going go Lol. Oh, serious. worse. I'm really sure point is. still answered question. know April ameliorates need lockdowns? 100% agree. It’s absurd blame outbreaks entirely protests. It’s also absurd say protests *no* involvement outbreaks. Even ignoring obvious spread would occurred protests, there’s secondary impact. People simply less likely follow social-distancing see tens thousands people congregating. even moreso healthcare officials scientists arguing protests safe.

And people say everyone wearing masks, it’s spaced protests aren’t? everyone wearing mask, not. idea immunity short lived paranoid fringe belief supported evidence. article designed scare you. reinfection likely months, would seen many cases now. Good point. went back 2 weeks, maybe going back month would better comparing 2 sets data. take gap year delay fall 2021? know would huge change plans, kids that's would try do. Fuck this. 

I don’t wanna get sick. Wear fuckin masks. Yeah that's pretty much point. numbers skewed heavily missed many cases early on. 

I'd surprised missing 1 4 cases right increased testing. agree. People reporting biases. hold every country comparisons hold, even absolute values accurate.

I agree better data could taken, best indicator moment far aware, anybody making opposite claim substantial proof cRiSiS aCtOrS HoSpItAlS  Keep mind Trudeau’s wife got coronavirus early pandemic. taking rules seriously. probable both. think current Situation USA big reason mask duty still place Germany. school uses Skype. psychologist uses Zoom. psychologist takes insurance area too. something going stomach giving really debilitating cramps, occasionally shitting blood. going months already.

I actually need see doctor 2 year old home. I'm going risk getting infected bringing back her. I'm waiting teacher's strike. like he's looking Obama thinking, god wish tan. think doctors able learn others works develop best practices. would imagine doctors nurses would feel done better job 200th COVID patient vs 1st. However, still important healthcare professionals continue share lessons learned. 


If interested, please share Free webinar Lessons Learned New York City:  government Canada respectfully declinea.you invitation visit ... We're uh ... Washing masks day. Probably worried people inhale rinse way deepest bronchi alveoli.  Duce start putting patient overflow gyms.  evidence base built time experience well clinical trials consistent results... enough. Treatment COVID-19 symptoms adapted infections epidemics, global consensus best treat C19. also anything preventive. Even Remdesivir clinical trials yet reach masses. mention controversy around US government buying current stock, nothing like equitable access. Yeah, it’s interesting sure. Unfortunately, virus never going disappear part hopefully immunity possible eventually.

It’s probably worth noting death rates lagging effect isn’t always week two either. instance broadway actor passed away sick 3 months.. Key Peele? Yup Like group eight came downstate, drank way across TC, tested positive? two flew Cherry Capital tested positive *the next day*? 

I mean, come on. fact tested positive soon community exposure tells least symptomatic get tested quickly. hopefully stay closed well. unless places ready install better hvac systems get UV disinfectant lights installed place. results florida taking 7 days longer considered pre-existing conditions stretch imagination. trying prove healthy wrong. Healthy people die. Period.  research, appears journal [JAMA](http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.11787), suggests experts may underestimated pandemic’s death toll publicly reported deaths.

Title bit confusing. bot sucks.

And mods refuse let us vote sub rules strange priorities life. love Trumps entire lineage, horse pretty common protein large part world (outside US) despite falling fashion last 75 years, still consumed. cases, better eating bovine least horses put work part lives taking slaughter. country full selfish narcissists ruled narcissist spreading viruses everywhere. Good Trudeau let US kill idiocy. necessarily. know anecdotal, hometown (quarter million-sized city Netherlands) mildly affected virus (it locked same, though) served overflow center throughout epidemic massive university hospital. measurable impact local infection rate, among health care workers community. 
It takes lot discipline smart leadership achieve though - qualities seem critically short supply US times. honestly heck do? vaccine it’s going keep going X amount people non-carriers virus lacks ability affect new hosts

Other countries gotten relative containment it. fact, $1,000 free speech. people paying would exercising constitutional right free speech, bad thing? like free speech? Bart!! true, hopefully that's good ol cells jump in. Still lots know, I'm optimistic immunity bit longer that. Hopefully get vaccine Fall/Winter need worry much anyway. inmates like general population

Not exactly. First all, think underage criminals held separate facilities adults. suppose there's going lot people aged 70+ jail. I'm betting national health agencies sitting approval process long, probably like days months. right missing lot cases early NYC, 1 100 ratio- like 1 25 ratio. [Estimates something like 2.2M infections (CI 1.4 - 3.1) NYC reporting [total 85K cases translates \~ 4% total cases discovered NYC 4/1.

What earth?  Forreal. 70% US overweight. 

This goes show population SERIOUSLY risk. skype zoom. private service meets medical safety requirement. pain management doctor doxy.me. However, available great, especially psychology. psychologist friends says people much less likely cancel no-shows telemedicine, many people simply can't leave house easily appointments. It'll nice choose go back person, definitely great expanding access. mexico controls (: close short-term rentals, probably takes lot clientele away bars. I'm sure wear one. orders I've seen medical exemptions.

Still mean stores let he's perfectly right wearing mask. stores perfectly right bar bring wherever tell people he’s autistic leave alone I’ve seen.

If can't wear mask, leave home. car he's old enough responsible enough. mask *itself* gotten redder. problem environment *around* mask gotten redder (and dimmed somewhat) making mask seem redder comparison. tell looking edges photo, orangeish. I'm college. I'm convinced enough classes online reason I'm pissing California winter job pays well going give covid. 

If needs get hell house, maybe visit relatives while. get camping supplies, solar chargers, unlimited data plan go hike Freshman year. 

Freshman classes tend stuff 300 people room three hours anyway, way hell safe, without even considering dorms. say screw take gap year. Go deliver food people. Make money, much safer. Develop app. Write book, make seven part recording playing parts. Something. 

Ask wants do. mother lost sense smell decades ago. I've never known able smell. remember coming home school one occasion asking mom burning kitchen. Once, actually small fire oven. Yes aside deranged racists (yes Canada too) everyone proud Mr. Trudeau. response covid perfect pretty damn good based science. Trump even said new name, USMCA, show American first initials first. petty horrible way treat closest ally. It’s dumb idealistic. 

Canada Mexico coming trade agreement things degenerate here? That’s possibility. require lot ship air transport though, won’t able pass US....unless negotiate trade corridor? think that, call Nana despicable, wrong.

I never called anyone despicable earlier post. put words mouth. Also, point grandma earlier post younger people done everyone understands risk. want live without seeing family grandchildren.

Lack impulse control going lead regret road someone passes away meet up. definitely short sighted this. Old people touch stuff. younger folks take responsibility stuff. WAY different us going public without masks strangers friends residences etc. Immediate family often lot things would anyone else. 

But covid care people strangers not. basically saying willing put immediately family risk video conferencing something put year.

I understand man, hard cut social contact, need think long term. accurate title would ""not directly caused"". indirectly caused covid. like people coincidentally started dying going on. pandemic caused changes behavior, care, mental health, etc, caused increase deaths. mean.... *gestures everything* u/The_Homocracy much nicer rebuttal. Interesting ignoring it. didn’t 4 Kidd 6 years, would boat. believe getting gives permanent immunity. sure orbit does. need region lot virus spread, nobody either control group vaccine group got infected know worked.  miss living closer lake Waterdown happy Guelph shit. One first adopt Mask everywhere inside, staff Guelph General amazing mom goes chemo. patients much essential medical procedures mom give shit telling people get close. One lady apparently said breath ""she's friendly rattlesnake"" last week let anyone else elevator way ultrasound. yeah it’s amazing biggest issue didnt testing beginning March. isnt hyperbole either, mean total number tests run less 1000 March 6th. 

We likely seeing 1 100 cases early NYC exploding. knowledge landmarks deceive me, picture shot telephoto lens, significantly truncates depth. It'd really hard make judgments spacing it. worries. Thanks clarification. rooting succeed. can’t states/provinces/countries well others not. virus keep going! 

Some states like mine (Ohio) others like NH, NJ, MA, name few, got ahead virus. Ohio specifically closed early (no gyms, bars, parks, etc. could opened). also fantastic Dr. Amy Acton serve director OH Dept Heath, led us crisis. beginning, governor, lt. Governor Dr. Acton would hold daily press conferences specifically discuss Covid-19. Sometimes six days week. talked everything.. medical science importance masks, economic impacts unemployment benefits, depression isolated ways seek free help.

That said, wish states took seriously perhaps wouldn’t see cases increasing again. stigma surrounding US, cannot travel Europe, plans see family Italy. knows happen...

Best wishes family friends. Stay safe there. kids won’t leave house vaccine. Sorry mom man. wish best! 100% mom sucks ass. hope recover alright :( Case fatality rate. Good ol' exponential kinetics. difference EU US people choose (which survey covers), lockdown policies. feel fellow glasses wearers. 

 tried many different masks tried everything get good seal fog glasses.  Nothing works perfectly. Best Mask metal nose piece, still seal well enough stop fogging.  

Latest technique wear mask underneath glasses (top part mask, tucked bottom glass frames). use ""croakies"" eyeglass cords, tighten glasses face. keeps mask nearly sealed get least amount fogging way. really annoying though cause top part mask close eyes kinda irritating. less irritating fogged glasses.

Luckily office work wear mask much. could imagine wear one day work.  think would switch contacts something. People NY/NJ learned. Yeah, use zoom. way China watch meeting too. nailed head. sxsw waited city Austin declare emergency. Insurance. I'm expert, think vaccines put antibodies combat disease. So, already covid beated it, body already antibodies. **Not expert though** small town unfortunately Now, I'm statistician, number seems high.

Like, worryingly high. Lol. really. Including outdoor exercise? trying stay informed I've met boisterous rude people around world, I've also met lots decent American tourists. Seems tired old stereotype. representative rest world 🗺, smart Link comment post direct terms say interested posting negative articles Sweden (seeing give country interested need fixing (therefore interested ""negative"" articles) preponderance news still usually wear glasses, whenever go mask switch contacts.

They’re paranoid introverts.  new trade negotiation techniques ? USA leveraging microbes dominate. MAG I’d say experts Nordic countries aboard Sweden’s Expert decicions, (in fact measures chosen decisive) polite criticism He'd probably get socialization using video chat wear mask socially distance person. People keep saying want go in-person ""normalcy"", anything normal due precautions anyway.

And even was, 1 semester less socializing worth bringing home deadly global pandemic. believe strong survive. would measure things parking meter lengths, dumbass /s Funny seem hear ""we need get kids back school"" folks work hours

I'm going assume mean likely overweight obese due posted photos. mean additional information, please let know. 

Anyway, word healthy somewhat subjective. overweight pre-existing conditions maladies related weight not, could considered 'healthy' certain definitions. 

Nearly 72 percent United States overweight, I'm guessing sizable portion group considers 'healthy.' don't, probably percentage healthy people United States probably 10 percent take account factors.

Also, really strange takeaway article general. 😂

Trump Mr. Burns lot common lot places like Amazon, care rental places, believe even post office independent contractors work with. guess forgot include pretty part public. Yes stuff needs open nothing gets shipped without it, however, general public need cars washed/serviced initial shut k, thanks! reason help people, gave everything human give...

...and others still even willing wear face masks.

It's sad, may rest peace. links reading. Would like follow them. 7 Trillion? Holy fuck.

While guys busy shitting deadly (but deadly) virus fighting amongst face masks, Trump pulled greatest heist world history. Great Grandchildren's Great Grandchildren still paying they're adults.

Jesus Christ... 7 trillion. Question, know BLM protests risk people crowd yell sing hours long wearing masks, mean voting person perfectly safe long people wear masks? parts globe handling ""symptoms"" horribly... addressing root causes right stretch agree 100%. wheelchair user going conventions feel really bad taken front queues photo ops etc. I’m happy wait where’s crowded let reaches position I’d queuing. frogs gay fight. Well—if we’re honest—most Americans trying figure electoral college is, well. Lot better Trump really low bar. :) I'm going start Modi debate here. K byeeeee They've learned good bit.

Wow, sure look happy. mean come on,Trudeau total snack, I'd love see man shirtless horse. comment ignorant. parents lived perfectly balance life Covid kids could still go school. parents job can’t completed home. Daycares closed thanks covid, people might need work longer get second job thanks covid. 

This virus thrown MASSIVE curve ball billions people can’t blame prepared. make bad parent can’t deal unprecedented situation. 

But yes, ignorant statement technically correct “schools isn’t supposed free child care” statement dismiss FACT 10s millions kids, teens adults, depend school form free child care, free meals, free education. fair, we're 2 democratic senators.

Progress. I’m full-time time employed college educated professional moved WFH. Saving 5-6 hours week commuting, spending almost nothing gas money, less going eat, less leisure spending, reviving hobbies reading fishing made life objectively better. Sorry doesn’t fit narrow world view it’s Reddit trolls people collecting UE preferring life right now.

It’s way try justify political agenda, lockdowns work. Countries acted faster sweeping measures nearly eradicated disease basically square one again. Sorry can’t live life like before, frankly aren’t important everyone’s life changed drastically. Wish list included picking online order dispensary going straight home then?
 
Do nothing? news mild infections still struggling recover months illness even strokes heart attacks, previously young healthy people doctors know treat help them.

You read much sub lol dentist used 1.5% peroxide get teledoc insurance. It’s $40 visit, prescription part useless Georgia unless it’s something need 3 days less. doctors tele visits pay full price since haven’t reached deductible. it’s $80 pop. still sucks least person also weight, height, general checkup, too. ECMO machines appropriate patients otherwise young healthy they're extremely invasive. also expensive less prevalent vents require advanced training use correctly. true subset patients, seem make meaningful improvements ventilation. IMO continued shutdowns important - still finding incremental improvements COVID treatment, much better put getting sick long possible. So... millions Muslims locked China Muslim? know 11 million Uyghur 10 million Hui Muslims China, right? *all* locked up? I'll give hint, answer spelled N-O. Get brain ~~out gutter~~ Reddit. Well ideally want take care better time OPEN 'ER  going give sarcastic answer, realized idea over/under actually works. play blackjack gamble Everyone survives something gonna die something else eventually honestly don’t think even wants re-elected. Others family likely run 4 years. Yep... father sent long term nursing home/short term rehab center combo... way, damned well would gone place brought home CoVid-19 killed mother well.

Royally angers me, especially since CoVid-19 symptoms came home damned rehab center even knowing 3 cases minimum facility CoVid-19 test sending home us.

I'm blunt this: rehab facility murdered mother negligence. overweight healthy. People need get it. body designed carry lot weight. puts risk kinds things. Yeah way see it’s lot like washing hands cleaning surfaces: it’s always good news know large variety agents work remove/inactivate COVID. 

Being able ask dental patients start procedures mouthwash going help add layer protection help protect professionals getting infected, turn good news patients infected dentist bad news everyone. Please go country better like China, India, Nigeria... Again, 3.5% 10 years. need look picture Halene sister. fat all. picture top best. beautiful 16 dying.

~edited try say meant coherently fucking morons. simple sure arguing like youre invested true 👀 Wait...? What?      
I knew COVID fucked sense smell/taste, guess hadn’t heard changing *the way* things smell.

EDIT: hope you’re well you’re mend quickly. Hang there, friend kick COVID’s ass!!! I'm fence would like options available future. Tele works great appointments ""Yeah, everything good, please renew meds"".

But something actually physically wrong me, I'd rather person.
 
So guess well visits phone, sick visits person. literally addressed posts. 

There nothing done legitimate civil unrest. leadership FED, may able dodge bullet actually something pandemic. 

Instead, people pissed enough vacuum willing risk lives change shit. 

However, I've stated, mere fact wearing masks (as opposed ""protests""), means spread slower would be. get vaccine election red team wins mischief managed. cares negative side effects begin show november? Yes. fine 3x many people died per capita Michigan. Cases rising Florida mostly ramped testing, deaths low. Michigan correct response. Makes perfect sense. make certain amount sense. set amount electoral votes per state based population. problem winner take even candidate gets 45% votes state, majority, candidate 45% votes would get electoral votes. split based percentage votes candidate got state. Might change whole lot outcomes maybe seems fair Well, yeah. throes pandemic would cause matter?


Deal later - concurrently frontlines. Naturally mechanics vastly different. referring absurdity election result vs. intuitive expectation wins election. Result electoral college election lot easier understand.

At least UK Canada, whether particular party broad based national party regional party makes huge difference. think letting us Americans Europe yet. seriousness, feel horrible poor bus driver family. 3 million officially 1% way ""potential"" herd immunity. Hooray?  faithless elector changed outcome Presidential election, either need immediately flee another country dead Christmas. $1k fine designed random pointless jackasses want place spotlight fifteen minutes fame, literal traitors. issue rarely beds, mentioned, create more. issue staff. sky still blue made factual statement. We're waiting election November like good little democracy... although might change things continue way are. history polio, vaccine trials first started 1935. ""youths""? OK Einstein explain difference? USA pile SHIT Canada basically almost COVID Free? Good news! 

Death rates dropping **despite increase cases.** Also hospitalization length stay half was. county NJ nursing homes deaths 70% county deaths, CFR 7.7% overall...in nursing homes 26.9%, without nursing homes 2.8%. talking CFR still see drastic effect. Perfect world regard knowing guilty innocent. stuff overrated Yeah need evict pronto. friend rented house AZ three nurses St. Louis. think sarcasm. Trump kept saying lost prestige Obama could/has fixed it. Thank Sure, it’d bad, luckily science vaccine production greatly improved since 1955. 

Plus massive benefit vaccine provided outweighed 11 deaths. sucks people died, polio longer exists, meaning lives future generations saved. ""You assume we’ll get protection least take us cycle""

That's really need do, like yea would awesome 1 shot done, isnt realistic. Yeah, but...GYM's still open?!?!? kidding me.

WTF slow point? like watching house burn ten minutes finally going...*hmm, maybe I'll try calling fire department, may help.* Yes exactly. difference read City Ottawa also try pass bylaw well. Basically reason medically able wear mask oxygen tank don’t mouth. freedom ends actions effect people. bet Tom Cruise secret pulled badass mission impossible type immunity stunt isn’t threat anyway Oh phew. That's good news. would visit outside anyone wants get remotely near babies needs masked. Math math. Statistics math well everything study done properly Spain 1.2%. statistical conclusions also 98+% accurate depending study parameters. 

You point mistake saying math wrong. Well Maybe put breaks thinking “miraculously disappear”.... We’ve learned administration longer rely historical precedent. Faithless electors another facet could exploited nutcase power. likely, we’ve got start sealing shit up. 10m, good luck that! homo way possible: dude looks great beard now. wife date Stringer Bell weekend anyway. doesn’t much seal... assume feel cool air coming bridge nose good seal? 
americans perspective 'healthy' absolutely hilarious. 

Being obese/overweight one biggest health conditions have.

I obese destroys body mental health. Dont normalize it. vaccine developed ward novel coronavirus would likely limited long would shield infection, top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said Monday.

“You assume we’ll get protection least take us cycle,” Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said appearance live-streamed video conference hosted National Institutes Health.
 

😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒 evident hospitalization data, near 1st peak hospitalizations. trending trends look good, still 1st peak. Hospitalizations impacted testing, better metric track.

This true least Alabama &amp; Texas. researched states. Alabama currently Covid-19 patients hospitalized ever before. Also, looked Texas. currently 8,181 patients hospitalized. June 1, ever one time 1,888.

[TX Hospitalizations Hospitalizations, see tab Wait minute - think Trump dementia, Biden doesn’t?

LMAO You’re partially correct. people claim ADA, doesn’t mean get go store without mask would direct threat. However, mean store make ‘reasonable’ accommodations them, already exists form take out, delivery, online ordering. 

Also serious disability prevents wearing mask, shouldn’t pandemic anyway imo.

Edit: word United States failed. virus exposed broken country time. People need learn cannot trust America. live good state metro area, *might* able trust local officials depending are.

edit: trying distract racism stuff bottom Novembor 2024? That’s really annoying, it’s better nothing. figure vaccine, I’ll gladly wait line get year. Right repeated thing. Ah sweet, racism xenophobia! Neat! missing point. air constantly full stuff like viruses water droplets, small enough behave like large particles fall. float, moving air contains occasionally dropping air contacts surfaces. 

Infection likely exposed enough virus. Outside, probably coming contact virus occasionally, enough infect you. we're going worried cough likely infect someone two hours later, way avoid would put everyone hermetically sealed rooms.

No. make everyone mask indoors public. Outdoors virus comes people quickly diluted point dangerous. Indoors, masks keep concentration virus coming low enough unlikely infect someone else.  see public policy shifting direction is, unmasked people indoors main transmission vector this.  Interesting occurrence life cycle polio vaccination (from History Polio-- Vaccination Suspended
Leonard Scheele, MD, U.S. Surgeon General, suspended polio vaccination program order investigate safety six manufacturers’ vaccine.
The full review concluded 11 people died vaccine hundreds paralyzed. Though cause disaster never proven, likely certain production methods (which, turns out, follow Salk’s instructions) resulted failure completely kill Type 1 (Mahoney) poliovirus vaccine.

Can imagine would happen today something like occurred? sure hell does. 

lets say 90% certain winning vaccine. first market, get fame fortune. someone else beats there, don't. 

Some researchers times, would cut corners get first then, since pretty darn sure would work. number new cases US go every days?

I've noticing there's sort jig jag pattern graphs new cases daily US goes every days seemingly regardless overall trends. seen here: this? I've googled googled found nothing. reason could think timing reporting data. making comments weight sound pretty pathetic . medical perspective, implying 16 year old girl completely unhealthy deaths door chubby joke certainly wrong.

I realize coping mechanism try rationalize happen you, could. Deal it. Guarantee universities go online shorten semester thanksgiving. Many universities making plan beginning. said shame Canadians fact PM blackface...

*blackface  fan Trudeau, this’ll hurt Trump’s ego could use that. One virus. terrorist act. Apples oranges. Good grief, headline. Yeah kinda crazy. return labor generally lower return capital. That’s root cause problem is. labor extraordinarily profitable wouldn’t conversation. I've finally convinced company devs work better remote lol. Never could done without lockdown. They're dinosaurs tech industry. Bring medical cruise ship! people walking around giant purple boyles red sores body, they'd taking lot seriously. swear half battle ""if see it, exist"".

It rural Michigan, XD House arrest.... That’s true slightest Yeah cloth ones long time. surgical type still wire metal band. riding bikes outside since spring walking/bike trails wearing mask. Usually morning, many folks I'm past real quick. dream going gym crowded indoor environment. grocery shopping 6am door opens,mask on, get get asap. meaningful democracy 90% population believe ancient sky fairies? Sadly, *is* practical solution, rich countries. means chance stamped ""good enough"" untold billions (I assume, checked) pouring vaccine research stop vaccine mass-produced.

Now, many things happen virus, including becoming seasonal – trends Europe seem suggest that, least temperate climates, could case. so, would reduce number shots would need take.

But even then, remain situation rich countries afford vaccine.

Hopefully, something better found, eventually. Well leave get chance SARS-CoV-2 upgraded Cold climate resistance Aquatic transmission mutations early on. SARS-CoV-2 knows shit! end day reality DATA infections messaging us point. 

Which interesting, since experts concerned convinced would super spreading protesting. 

Kinda like lot us knew we'd OK finished high school science health classes

Parties bad, Protests OK precautions taken. Might be. also likely shit Canada right best idea one travelling internationally right now.  Like understand purpose Electoral college. I'm fan partisan gerrymandering even leans right left.

Gerrymandering think might bigger issue. Tbh. words offers finite protection? downvotes got came chinese redditors Hahaha condolences I'm soaked protective layer sweat get started religion masks mental illness promotes lack logic reasoning healthy debate promotes critical thinking. country full ""good christians"" decided go path have. went ""love thy neighbor"" care economy real fuckin quick. 

 discussed comments little education, yea, think education lack critical thinking, reasoning healthy skepticism driven country extremes. 

There many facets Americans may way are. Lack specialized roles workforce, worshipping dolla dolla bill, lack cultural identity, need constant stimulation, low morals, bad parents, culture puts status all, lack filial piety, rise easily digestible conspiracies, etc. Like said another commenter, tried put one comment, we'd 40 page thesis.

Edit: almost forgot favorite ones. Divisive rhetoric, feeling superiority accomplishing nothing. vaccine might cause extreme side effects than, no, ""work"". guess next weeks graph going change drastically, states spiking havent seen increase deaths yet. brought Zoom security issue kinda blew off. told using “HIPPA approved version zoom.”  that's reality, even prod saying explicitly. people assessing personal risk low, many people find discomfort inconvenience worth it.

People quite selfish like that. you’re solving problem increasing complexity problem. dog animal choosing. people really think wrote definition actually know use Google anything looking cuckold porn 🤔 first thought saw picture roids probably made things worse him. amount regularity needs take look like likely going severely weaken entire body. would love see kind source would pull ass demonstrate that.  fact think Trudeau libs “extremist-left” makes laugh yes, ended working. World's okayest prime minister?' political post, post saying person acting inappropriately mental illness taken psych eval. think got taken mentioned name current US pr*sident, woman question mentioned too. Anyway hope getting help. article title misleading. He’s basically saying it’s like flu vaccine Woooo U're patient u go hospital   shiny silver dollar says contracting COVID past pre-existing condition insurance companies. Maybe government brought outbreak control cared children's futures It’s working parents... Mask usage US actually pretty high compared western countries throughout Yeah, let’s kick ass! pretty good podcast episode, I'd recommend listening it. 

But no, really different levels lethality. strains seem likely kill (whatever percentage is), however, one mutated Italy seems likely infect passed others.

Kids transmitters pretty big deal, since know kids huge transmitters things like flu (because get coughy sneezy, pass around school, bring home). seems kids get it, getting lot lung symptoms see adults, instead we're seeing internal inflammation symptoms (still great growing bodies, less likely get ""coughed out"").

The episode actually talk protests. havent seen huge spike cases cities huge protests, seems combination outdoors lots people wearing masks seemed bad. Based that, agree maybe beaches outdoor parks *should* open, long people make point socially distance close anyone long. Weird, thought plumbing company. people texas wearing masks. Even friends trump supports suspicious hoax wearing masks..lol headline tells story. could also said majority people dislike lockdown. Podcast? Fuck off. Limiting travel makes disease control manageable, yes? 

Even region completely inundated outbreaks, still remains validity cutting equally infected tourists. simple math. Fewer infected = easier flattening curve. Perhaps stop paying white collar yuppies working home ""not working"" either first time see scientists talking fictional thing. peer reviewed studies available this? Seems lot pre-print, hoping find credible sources this; much crosstalk standardized info would muy bueno. Fuck yeah!

This first time since **March 30th** Covid-19 death.

Turns lockdown stuff actually proper job. 

Now make sure temporary farm workers infecting others rural towns... 6336 Monday versus 5266 last Monday Oh yep got ur point, wondering posted old article. 

It seems like western experts hold different opinions issues. remember article WHO/West said masks r necessary buy east Asia scientists insisted it. Head China CDC (not sure) said, ""if mask protect health workers, could nothing protect normal ppl infected? "" Exactly, that's thinking. worked “volunteers” something wrong. experience punishment agency/organization receiving volunteers. highlight unusually low death rate..

H1N1: 1.4 Billion infected, 151,700 575,400 dead ([according 11.5 Million infected, 535,000 dead. I’ve heard (a) lot scientists focused finding vaccine - obvious reasons, (b) trying things newly applied vaccine development may speed timeline. course big demand getting vaccines sooner, time, trials still take time.

One things drug makers differently trials conducted, start putting vaccine vials packaging already. trials conclude, things ready ship right away. not, take loss toss everything. 

The podcast listened address timeline, someone somewhere (CDC) set goal Jan 2021. timeline brought discussed later podcast manufacturing testing process, whether track covered. Genuinely curious trying start argument, anyone interacted someone (maybe process contact tracing, idk) knew positive refused quarantine alert others around them? Outdoors work. Hundreds scientist reported virus airborne caused person person contact via droplets. saying masks used times public spaces regardless social distancing. also asking revise guidelines virus. 

Here's evidence mind little reading. say pretty much thing. know news network prefer reading. Given world's population much lower then, think percentage-wise, current commercial flight usage lower soldiers transported around 1918. aviation industry basically cratered result this, demand picking \*some\*, still fraction time last year. 

Keep mind, too, travel days considerably cleaner hygienic 100+ years ago - faster, well, less exposure, matter. 

Also part, symptomatic COVID patients staying home going anywhere, option sick Spanish flu patients/soldiers. Downvotes think going happen? Well, happening. Yea. Covid-19 mental health hasn’t good decade :’) 

Funny work, pressure free time someone! 

I’ve creative I’ve ages, I’ve started writing album, getting planned written. 

It’s wonderful. /r/Volumeeating data clearly shows gathering, BLM protests, anti-mask protest, church services, etc. spread virus.

Stop trying make spread virus political. admit it. UBI came paid minimum $1200/month, ass would instantly quit work sit home day enjoying never work every again. Hell expenses would actually go put gas vehicle 3 times month. 

I enough hobbies keep entertained. decreased expenses I'd banking even money already do. UK Canada, name Dragon's Den Sweden's reputation crashed big time... done doing.

Its different feeling US though, America feels like case pity, Sweden feels like.... dunno werid haha Wait happened??? /s I'm enjoying made OCD worst years. However, saved ton money, quit smoking pot years, lost almost 40 pounds. strange thought probably done things without pandemic I'm happy can't wish done it. strange feeling. I'm going wear mask. Suit I'd like keep freedom getting sick dying, thank much. Yeah hotly contested. there's little doubt virus aerosolized, whether means high enough concentrations infectious doubtful. leader group scientists beating drum long time. knows, may right. I'd say success countries suppressing virus social distancing norms 1.5m strongly argues it. anyways, despite attacking me, beside point. take still retarded ""new cases"" supposed snapshot person tested positive, progression anything else. know many new cases asymptomatic, new hospitalization, critical, mild symptoms, etc. death rates absurdly low, even waiting 2 weeks. least that's good? nobody wearing masks street pretty much anywhere. unbelievable. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* dangerous.  There's unambiguous evidence recirculated air spreads illness. ""quiet diner"" air conditioner moves air around across everyone room, spreads illness aerosolized droplets. addition, rules permit ""quiet diner"" also permit ""a loud bar"". multiple elements here. Alcohol strong disinhibition effect, people broadly disregard elements safety.  bars many restaurants loud, raised voices help spread virus. course, people go bars get laid, want physically close person. surprising number elective surgeries result short ICU stays. certain age groups risk factors, would automatically go ICU surgery. 

that said, probably/hopefully need ICU go better rushing needed Becton Dickinson plans produce 2 million tests week end September. Also, let’s go bed numbers. there’s one bed, it’s occupied, means there’s beds available. talking thousands occupied beds?

How many people panic attacks people like OP stirring pot? sports event crowd last saturday. absolutely amazing back. Felt good. remember reading multiple articles typically viruses become infectious, less deadly. It’s also likely doctors become lot better treating March. source? manner india barely testing? done millions tests massive population course lower rate numbers often skewed like crazy india. ""At typical indoor air velocities, 5-micron droplet travel tens meters, much greater scale typical room settling height 1.5m floor.""

That's quite significant. get it? Back early April cases reaching peak area, dad's partner work tested positive virus. drove car together shared desk. Never wore mask Another one coworkers tested positive well. thought sure dad it. quarantined two weeks second week got tested. Negative! possible? We're still baffled it. saying virus attacks corpus collosum, inflammatory response damages it? former, bloody hell. Guys, virus cause loss appetite? swear half town seems sickness, can't stand can't eat anything. article doesn’t say that. says part one thigh numb, nothing leg nothing arms. State orders dictated bars must remain closed. opened anyway defiance order. There's sense arguing semantics violation law vs. violation state orders nothing change point support yours, lets go road. I've time grow larger herb garden, cook more, play video games feel nagging ""i need productivity"" life much. I've exercised felt home, literally figuratively, myself. time time cat enjoy solitude.

Its heaven! remind me! 3 weeks TBH Germany open Gyms weeks/months now, impact. Theaters open bit certain states well. far see Massachusetts well infections wise. Canada lagging behind US mask usage since almost data shows gathering people, include protests, spread virus. equally wrong make spread virus protests political make wearing mask political. 

So let's keep facts:

\- gathering people spread virus, include BLM protests. 

\- BLM, anti-mask protests, etc. fact responsible surge cases. would complete idiot think thousands people gathering spread virus.

\- wearing mask, time, public contribute spread virus. 

\- go Restaurants bars. School employees already overworked underpaid. given medal, asked literally risk life. $$$... You’re gonna wait two weeks, wait two weeks, two more, two more, forever. 

The point need terrified forever. Funny left Denmark comment. assume they're opening more. measures due Sweden's high burden infection.

As Finland's measures Denmark's measures. here's thing: neighbouring situation allows compare measures conclude part Norway's measures due Norway's decisions, infection burden itself, case Denmark's Finland's decisions.  Dying home yeah care hospitals full stopped elective surgery test backlogs take long? dont know ""we"" is. one know takes multiple ""amazing"" vacations year. one know takes even one. 


Have considered half country isnt privileged you? Right evidence-based treatment viral infection. 

Just clarify, treatments (remdisivir, steroids). anything *preventative*, want vaccine. Yeah it’s well-known summer temperature destroy virus... That's people saying since things started open relax weeks ago&lt;.

There lockdown protests. ""Soft"" reopenings. BLM. opening up. etc etc.

Through death rate continued fall.

Through people said ""Just wait 2 weeks. *Then* things get bad!""

Result: Deaths currently lowest point since things started, trending down.

""Sweden done something important starting investigation understand strategy worked. really appreciates initiative, countries also learn from, tells Svenska Dagbladet.""


""The chief also says Swedish government ""done best"" situation countries sure act pandemic. universal solution ""right"" virus management, points out, according SvD."" Stronger lockdowns = better results. ""Muh freedom"" crowd literally kill everyone left alone. Yea that’s meant said “obligation release preliminary data”. It’s share holders. It’s annoying whenever things released media, sub honest, act like it’s huge scientific breakthrough add 1/4 industrialized world pre-existing conditions. 

People always think something serious like diabetes fuck up, drinking weekends friends, smoking, exercising enough pretty making pre-existing condition even though would say perfectly healthy. many places, mayors don’t ability issue orders like unless governor grants power. governor Arizona barred mayors putting stricter policies place (stricter state) mid-June. mayor Phoenix playing catch-up Doug Ducey blocked able mandate mask usage cases already exploded. Phoenix passed mask mandate first opportunity Ducey gave power it’s place since June 20th. large crowds pandemic bad idea.

The cause irrelevant that. people steal disability placards take convenient parking spaces real handicapped people. fake handicapped skip lines Disney.

Pretty clever kid btw. yeah, even teachers still bash Sámi, there's little hope kids learn better disagree would happen. saying person agree 100%. RN here. pandemic real unified approach way get control. It’s POTUS Federal government provide us guidance. believe China's numbers everything seen read past 6 months? 250,000 like Italy, Spain, France, Germany? 2.5 million like US? ""The quality immune system pure luck"" that's debatable Could false negative. Also understand it, easier diagnose beginning. cleared virus quick second week may sufficient RNA get positive test. meant bitter bill gates Jr.. pattern see handles things make several public statements “there evidence X true”. implies X true sends message. REALLY need say “WE DONT KNOW” “we haven’t researched particular issue know sure”. 

Many statements confusing:

- evidence COVID19 transmitted human human. 

- evidence facemasks effective lowering transmission. 

- evidence COVID19 transmitted small droplets. 


This makes backward useless resource that’s like Microsoft internet explorer meme. Needs guns story ""the American"". People understand sarcasm Well far deaths remaining cases exploding. could mean one two things: deaths start increasing couple days due lag deaths cases, since treatment improved young people catching death rate continue drop. lowest number daily deaths since things started? things started single death there. thing raging control months, never came first wave (in region anyway) reopening, cases surging, soon followed large surge deaths. hard predict, it’s really bad. wish could find fucking free weights. Everything sold immediately near me. evidence back claim up? That's pretty far-fetched. lmao sad reading comments. people ""enjoying"" this? There's fucking pandemic killing people making people sick, countless people unemployed businesses decimated end sight 

The third people responding ""enjoying"" beyond privileged good time dark chapter history occurred idiots seized control. entire continent laid waste dealing this. careful idiots. trouble maintaining minimum healthy weight sick, lost sense smell, highly unusual exception rule. likely underlying health problem investigated. amazing. Excellent. aware well. doubt region would effect good see tested many locations. think problem dominant parties really spent lot money campaigning better things possible.

We've told M4All cannot happen, cannot UBI, etc.

If suddenly might actually start expecting money collect might actually used enrich lives instead lives donors.

So think there's really strong hesitation go road problem along politicians want give us policies want. we'll suddenly realize they've problem along they'll harder time saying future. actually strong argument, legally speaking. Causing harm denying opportunities protected group, even unintentionally, constitutes discrimination, much common overt bigotry.

If high-risk group *should* stay home, people restrictions, I'm surprised I'm hearing argument often. Human brain feeble biases. Plus mob mentality scares people telling opinions. 

Whenever praise criticize something controversial, getting mobbed. nobody. imagine name protect. become lot scarier. want cameo roles Walking Dead. easy, whatever southern neighbors doing, opposite prior post removed purely political (not sure was). covid hard positions officials take. lean towards left usually side states officials. think took courage Abbott minimal regulations do.   


From Texas, think many leaders weird positions. realize something needs done covid much base want reasonable regulations. Abbott finally mask mandate outrage substantial. could easily end carrier, many want masks regulations vote base outraged actually statewide mandated mask. used political ads next time he's election. city leaders, live (Amarillo), bulk citizens refuse wear mask testing officials, city actually enforces mask rule, city officials also likely lose reelections, instead officials urging citizens wear mask (nothing happen don't). agree much could prevented strong leadership, something simple mask law end career, tough position in. defending leaders explaining.  


I'm still shocked Abbott something, even though live nothing changed, wear masks still wear still don't. might slight uptake mask usage, much. Maybe change coming weeks. agree. Update Florida beach parties Trump rallies. subreddit full them. Trying best blame others. First originated Italy, US. Oh absolutely. conspiracies whack know Kiwis learned Flight Conchords, means bad thing could first week without knowing, could false positive, could gotten lucky Social distancing absolutely worked. talking 6 feet?  Yeah, told need slow testing down, test, find something.

/s, hopefully obvious. mayor power little limited. I'm sure capable isn't.

The governor Arizona disallowed Mayors giving stay-at-home orders city level. mayor Phoenix could fought harder restrictions, honestly can't unilaterally guess gotta certain type personality want socialize, go public, hang friends, go places engage hobbies. nice first month got quick, I’m introvert myself. New cases reported last 6 Mondays increase previous Monday:

July 6, 2020: 6,336 (20.3%)

Cautious optimism week's Monday increase lower we've seen, optimism certainly offset fact we're coming holiday weekend likely saw reduced testing. can't take today's numbers alone sign progress, I'm looking forward seeing rest week looks like whether less-than-expected increase balanced higher numbers rest week. sub predictions virus started anecdotal. 

Also, Spanish flu death rates low pandemic. Later proven wrong. Check video Time Ghost History. They're usually well researched evenly presented topics. mention thing, likely rats respiratory transmission led devastation sad DeWine going implement statewide mask mandate months ago walked back. Ohio leader shutting things making tough decisions. feels like we're falling behind.

The odds occurring mouse models humans low. Extremely low. serious? need laughing stock used mindset, unfortunately people view lazy unmotivated. essential partner opposite gender can't provide. want keep around long possible.

Is wants? guess confirms 1/3 population introverts. world never match US graph, deaths peaks lag case peaks pretend know this, saying enough UV present night significantly impact sars_cov_2 virus particles? pointing drop death rates important note praise, disease leave afflicts unscathed. Many carry long term damage lungs, reducing lung capacity substantially (perhaps rest lives). Others suffer heart problems still others greater risk organ problems/failure.

Lower death rates awesome, that's exactly want praise healthcare workers great work they're there. outcomes disease either death complete recovery. Thank you! It’s cake day, yours. Well I’m Europe too, (UK). people retarded here. Smart Now, that's good idea. showing live feeds hospitals TV like courtrooms. Everyone needs see what's going there. thing wearing mask save lives sweden nobody cares all. 

Seriously. think people outside sweden realize little everybody cares sweden virus. go walk maybe count dozen wears mask mostly elderly.

I amazed Spaniards critized harsh government following protocol wearing masks almost mandatory.

But sweden like life went almost like normal. think what's saving total catastrophe fact, swedes social distancing default country 40% swedes live alone, plus life mostly indoors. guess Spain life social outdoors, Italy.

 countries adopting strict measures prevent virus spreading sweden. careful say adopting measures. got lucky sparse populated country. feel like jerk part massive pedophilia ring two different levels people wrapped left / right agenda think like human. course virus hoax, i've people close (not physically) effected it.

Surely it'll less year, it'll still thousands coming potentially including Texas, Florida, etc. (unless place super strict restrictions certain states). 

Back surge March + April, thorough lockdown, think also really helped closing colleges/schools sending everyone home. Since then, lockdown + mask wearing helped, currently lot people seem adhering social distancing wearing masks they're better lately. publish good news Sweden? not, bearing reality. We’ve figured treatment works? That’s news me. work major medical center. Hes busy rollerblading cottage regular middle class citizen fined $880 same. hope somebody fucks up.

You make 16-30 hour summer tourist spots right now. Go spend summer living ski resort. regret it. guy talking triage It’s negotiated write insurance. negotiate “discounts” physicians basically means say want take insurance take amount money we’re willing pay. discount passed patient. happens office visits, hospital visits, er visits, labs, medications. insurances pay less costs doctor provide service, doctor might take insurance doctor might take insurance lose money. People pay cash charged highest fees. I’m doubtful sometimes many articles young people died love omit crucial details surrounding previous health issues moments leading contraction. necessarily even leaving info out, like, you’re making article like that, it’s important state contracting it. don’t even mean major health issues either. Michael Yo, good friends rogan, contracted hit hard. He’s young enough fine shape. However week contracting it, planes day, sleep deprived running empty while. couple days contracted covid, took ton ibuprofen that, hit hard. Technically healthy, wasn’t treating body correctly short time contracting it. I’m saying healthy people aren’t dying, seems lot articles misleading. Science religion. 95% people understand actual studies believe like gospel. Corporations/large entities pay results want lab publish site almighty science absolute truth. know personal experience. Well, I’m wondering net positivity rate going average. claiming righteous, people believe tend spew lot hate. COVID, love neighbor value life yell people asking wear mask, even that, make stories satanists trying protect people? Even conspiracy, what? get people live? I've seen whole conspiracy develop last decade, latest thing people hate gets kludged onto overall conspiracy, lie lie gets less coherent time goes on. directly impacting people killing them. know Massachusetts well, I'm sure worth economic benefit open businesses. doesnt seem likely. takes LOT power move those. Even covered every inch solar panels (which wouldnt make nice experience), think still fall way short. entirely predictable pussyfooted around dangers recommendations. clamped hard, taken decisive steps quickly reduce rates, here. However, economy ruins, lives disrupted long lot people see light end tunnel. read cities siege conflict zones, point people stop caring danger, try get back normal routines. That's what's happening here, going accelerate. Humans creatures habit, tolerate much deviation routines long. people certain worldview established head, anything disrupts uncomfortable. wonder “lifespan adjusted” impact is. know it’s heartless people 80s dying years early bad someone 20s 30s dying early. weird think millions doses vaccine sitting around waiting completion clinical trials. One wonder many people partied bars hooked with? Yeah, governors really need step afraid backlash. NY good examples. right didn’t give fuck backlash. good shape thank that. immunity (never done before) 

herd immunity done plenty times before, though usually help vaccine. that's kids unvaccinated generally going die diseases. much herd immune, stay safe even without help. Don’t forget Wilson !!!! hmm. wonder he'd required wear mask? cater needs, course, way allows wear mask public, middle pandemic. nothing logical statement. Sorry. basically you’ll take 2 science courses anything biology chemistry, physics, life sciences, geology, etc. pursuing degree specific majors microbiology requirement. tested join team again. trump hand me, safe effective, i'm getting it. matter from.

I think point whether trust safe effective. awesome thing vaccines long people get rest protected! Herd immunity tolerate certain percentage antivaxxers (basically long antivaxxers+vulnerable folks can’t get vaccine various legitimate reasons doesn’t exceed 20% good!) get it. Im millennial. know like good job market suddenly collapse you. due respect gen Z. Millennial already got crushed crushed second time. many us finally recovering 08 crash. 

Gen Xers went 3 times dot Com bust. dont know havnt dragged burned boomers alive. Brace downvotes first sentence (not me), yes. typically happens. There's proof yet that's happened here, definitively proven predominant strain going around infectious. surprise later proven strain also less deadly, though course know sure. 

As second sentence, right - know lot look treat that's immensely helpful comes saving lives. Ah, old Russian troller publishing nothing bad news Sweden. Check history. think it’s 2020 year Winning, flu plus pneumonia plus car crashes going Win year years!
Also disappear eventually, make room Winning. I'm expert expert obvious?

Next they're gonna tell masks effective. watch video ? It’s article. 
He says arm leg numb. 

Don’t come trying tell i’m lying something actually took time looked at. Two years ago people probably would ripped ADA ""burdening small businesses red tape"" ""enabling snowflakes."" Unfortunately, change US' strategy appears de facto herd immunity waiting disappear one day. Look sulforaphane, potent anti inflammatory available supplement, comes broccoli. take one called BroccoMax. used cancer treatment. took chance pick drinking gained 30 lbs, fuck.

Cutting back though. Noooo him, fav. Man fleeing debris :/ Road Perdition, bad guy definitely good guy. Bill Gates twitting 84? May Masks Nurallink would reality live Florida drive I75 lot. lot plates state heading north Sunday. 

There steady amount state vehicles coming going. Glad everyone enjoying vacations, disappointed we’re determined keep rona party going. daily basis, indicate downward positivity rates overall? guess depends think virus ravaging Florida good thing bad thing. I've definitely seen ""lets go herd immunity ASAP!"" crowd say good thing. 17333 per day. Meanwhile US getting 40 50000 per day right now. 10p 6a curfew Dade County, but’s probably holiday weekend. sad :(. Yeah ton people around getting Texas. Thankfully nothing serious them.  Unpopular opinion: quite likely flu also spreads aerosol. main transmission route. Realistic responses focus eliminating risk.

What know flu novel coronavirus could obviously fill many books. Says Swedish defense force account. Kids society survive year remote learning. Many survive return normal in-class schooling. America wide-spread refusal accept realities pandemic. death rate per capita US several European countries continuing decline. link anything, know briefings are. seem pretty confident saying assume examples mind. President acknowledges embers places, we're great job control. Fuck yeah!

This first time since **March 30th** Covid-19 death.

Turns lockdown stuff actually proper job. 

Now make sure temporary farm workers infecting others rural towns... True, witness volleyball, ain't talkin'. doesn’t matter rate it’s happening at. really wanna risk dialysis rest life?  measures 60% that's bigger difference though. Many countries majority wearing masks outside still seeing rise cases. Similarly countries much mask usage, cases declining.

They help, along measures. be-all end-all fix virus. numbers that? Sure it’s higher 1%? wonder many masks face shields police departments could requisitioned quite different kids little older entire life organized around school day. washington generals winning nba championship year ""Obamacare"" made insurance get work quadruple cost. BCBS. Despite control spread, relatively low percentage people virus contagious right now. 

As barrel forward many come though, don’t worry. Getting real sick rich famous platinum health care bitching this. got tests first (and still do) receive best care. Shut already. Lots comments reflect don’t take seriously mock others do. Europe done great job containing virus. states US not. may communities safely, think many not.  FL comes mind.  hotspot school opens next month. mayor power little limited. I'm sure capable isn't.

I'm hoping everything arsenal honestly I'm seeing people trying redirect blame instead potentially politically unpopular things. really think president / federal government would instance mandated mask wearing earlier Governors? always shift blame.

More likely would even fewer effective actions shorter lock down. Everyone grandma seems know except Trump Admin GOP plurality people permanent lung damage. Including people asymptomatic.

But really common all. want shoot untested new drug body? needs 100% safe also needs work, way. Getting two things line easy, entire world working around clock develop vaccine. shit. Flu put hospital last 2 years asthma. Quit reading/watching news still believe it. is. (Also, results would Japanese, good end.) Also helped lockdown presented perfect opportunity cut really fucking toxic people life causes stress anecdotal evidence statistics. numbers that? That’s saying all. saying effective infection, combination virus + vaccine antibodies lead inflammatory response eosinophils lungs seen pathology. 

This desirable would prefer vaccine cause hypersensitivity reaction. hypersensitivity reactions eosinophilic lung disease something experience treating, frankly sounds better far better SARS. FEHvah preceded HUNgah! First I’m seeing anything like that. surely haven’t exceeded blatant disregard distancing. think NY gets lot credit deserves ultimately poorly managed outbreak beginning really good job end it.

I know that's unpopular opinion Reddit like sometimes. final destination type shit. Feels bad man. Thank you, learned something today :) call ""the Second Wave"". antivax, mean people hoping proper clinical trials bs? Zing! rockstar! truly amazing. Disney World opening 5 days, everything fine. /S bounce back, everyone, no, it’s reason risk lives teachers kids. Judging Florida neighbors way busy holding indoor house parties due rain. 

Side note: think it’s labs light reporting weekend testing. lot tests take 2-3 days taking 7 days results. surprise... one could’ve seen coming Source needed lol. live NJ now, I'm Texas...a college acquaintance mine owns gym Houston, frequent photos group workouts show plenty unmasked participants. wonder many celebs enjoy Reddit twitter. assume prefer anonymity we’ll never know. 

Do know /u/?  Good you. parents dont choice. right, point still bad, remember arizona's cases last month better treatment likely die speed past. numbers however skyrocket hospitals use triage care plans (banner health already that) rate growth deaths harder see (for example) 3% growth would look like 1 extra death per day even though 3% growth rate cases would dozens statistics that? kids never hear end it.

""I beat corona give birth triplets FORGET TAKE TRASH""

- Italy (Decimated virus early)

Denmark, Norway, Finland laugh Sweden's ""response"" lack care Citizens. goes show progressive plans economically feasible. school Greek life, guess I’m confused people would still living summer. bad enough? mix residents know mix religion send vegetarian food first 5 days give time provide mixed diet second parcel people chance declare preferences. Make sure prepared 6 weeks longer. know thats scary... Im different state we've waiting since March 22 benefits. Needless say we've underwater now. California seems act together little better. Right can't kick house. qualify unemployment bonus 600 PUA get caught bills that. also looking giving people extra stimulus check late July early August. get bills paid best cut expenses much next weeks. sure contact r/legaladvice someone help legal implications. worry.. going alright. Oooooh burn also super spreading events like churches bars weddings tons people get infected makes sense airborne Also US: lowest number COVID deaths per day since March 23rd, 7-day deaths continues drop. does. helped. plagues came back hundreds years, repeatedly. reservoir changed, rats. used live close proximity much fearless rat, didn’t avoid humans. ecosystem got taken current rat share cities with, avoid us more. 

Rat fleas vector. fleas lay dormant year. It’s low still death rates lag behind case rates. words, takes people die. Several weeks behind surge, surge deaths. Good see trending back down. second afraid going huge spike cases. Friday really long ago? I've seen articles posted like weeks lol could wrong, thought America's reputation took downturn elected Russian agent whose mission kill many Americans possible. Yeah, seems like good way create super spreaders logically makes sense something like comes along every 20-30 years so. natural population control really. fact humans think procreate much want, one planet that's increasingly filling up, ludicrous. think weaker older go, ill diseased go, different smaller weaker, injured animals getting picked lions. simple form natural selection. telling me, go store, like walmart, see gross weight people, people sick scrawny type drug, think ""if type humans society, would much productive worrying taking care people, paying medical bills, supporting lifesyles monthly checks nothing lives burden everybody. get feelings? military, everybody share, everybody keeps everything, everybody part system part, seeing lazy, fat, sick, gross people can't even take care makes shake head. Anything really. Finding medicine helps far important actually vaccine. treat fine could gain lot time vaccine research. anything else say repeat daily little ""herd immunity"" mantra? I'm surprised bored death yet. DeSoto one favorite places go FL. kayak fish lot amazing there. ton open space around feels natural one popular beaches. 

It cost 5 dollars park though. usually go automated machine pay booth right side road costs $5 go park. even read much know several flaws study. First diet consists low protein. care local health department says, that's actual experts advocate towards. Nobody trying lose body fat maintain muscle going eating enough protein eating fat. may dad, daddy? Dude literally chilled hair cooled whenever got angry. one ever visit places again? ""I've heard lot names, make sense, call Transylvania Flu, Drac-Flu-a."" We're going one least January. terrifying. really answering question mindset deaths averaged 26-30 days infected. 
 
The real surge started happening 3 weeks ago Florida, Texas, Cali Arizona. Californa little bit different since actually testing much states. 
 
However, start seeing deaths slowly start creep week next week shit hit fan. happen way, means math little shift weeks 1. 
 
That is, states totals counted correctly. proof aliens exist obvs exist Lol ok simple, measurably effective way help protect people. understand vehement response taking simple precaution. Trump, Palin, Biden... ones tired old two party system? Ditto. people actually like kids.

However, school in, full time job working home simultaneously handling school work bit... trying. I'm gonna real minute.

If 90 pretty high chance dyiing soon, virus not. 

In case, honestly believe want go legitimate needs using PPE...just let them. 

It's like 65 year old could good long time left.

At 90 even dont die probably like...a year two minor mobility left. one things even work everything hoax moon landing fake everything... literally hurt it? 


I get mild claustrophobic feeling first put mask on, especially bad allergy day, within minute feel totally fine again. Just... thing! seen recent mouthy buddha video youtube. Look up. Youll change minds im sure. retrain? point everyone wants that. Contributing society noble, worth it. However working contributing society meaningful way majority people. someone means live lifestyle want, includes playing video games day, care. people enjoy nothing anti social. returning residents requirement 14 day quarantine sure? Indiana still huge number ventilators available worst it. Right ventilator usage like 10%. heard somewhere US ton ventilators countries general. Also, think lot less people put means treatment. Yeah, need see physical therapist. minor knee pain that's gotten worse, migrated hip. think band, stretches provide temporary relief. disappointment humanity bad this, keeps getting worse day day. horrible. would nice life could laid back people without tragedy. 

I'm happy able spend time home make excuses wanting stuff end *do* interact people maintain social bonds even think activities boring interested moment. 

But would way nicer society chill people able spend time relaxing without hundreds thousands deaths economic collapse. Awe. pregnant delivering triplets tough best health! Super mom. Congrats family💖 Yeah noise around particular question deafening start.

Also distinction *transmission* *viral transmission* important. fact virus detected given distance source one thing: still concentrated enough distance realistically infect someone? Experiencing lockdown would’ve nice. “essential” life hasn’t affected all. “essential” economy, luckily I’m high risk category. Nice! gives hope. Thank input. People understand risk \*mitigation\*, especially dealing novel risk. willing make many assumptions contrary risk (assume status quo) risky path take. Understandable sentiment end hospital really want people people refuse wear masks ones looking you? Another point mention; vaccines olden days live virus weakened. produced chicken's eggs, finicky. meant long times source eggs, long times cultivate virus, extra time weaken it, short shelf life. Nowadays, vaccines using spike protein, method cultivation required, fabricating protein much simpler, faster, stable process, flown fast development things like ChAdOx Moderna vaccine. suspect vaccine end year, really doubt safety concerns it. Source; family member medical doctor got doctorate microbiology going med school yeah, that's mean work special ed kids. I'm saying reopen kids absolutely fine. That's ignorant statement. washington generals winless streak 2,495 games. seasons win all. also play NBA NBA likely even champion year.

TLDR: odds 0% Borders Norway Finland

Truly high-trafficked region... believe 10k tested US too. also citizens china choice follow dictates government, can’t even get grown adults wear masks realize mayor Phoenix can’t shut state Arizona, right?  Oh well, right. even see that. Agreed. Sometimes tbh can't even look US numbers make feel sick stomach always felt inevitable US *able* successfully defend agains virus. 

With Sweden, went back January told several weeks row they'd top rolling 7 day average per capita death rate WORLD would thought bulshitting me. part fasincation Sweden choose route, yet despite ability neighbors did. 

Although said realize Sweden lot dysfunctional gave credit for, quite sad tbh. seems like mix choice inevitability Sweden's poor response. Stuck boat bo laden metalheads? thanks 90% sure bad immigrants ""unified approach"" going happen experts allow encourage types protests going people go beach play golf. end article says published science journal tomorrow end list. exists make diet high saturated fat. correct. Especially cardio. dad several “elective” heart procedures require automatic stay ICU Yeah, dunno everyone acts like NorthEast somehow immune despite fact we're reopening everything too. assume due weird politicization issue. NorthEast undoubtedly see second wave given current level reopening. simple math. course opined basis vaccination, obtuse admit it.

Without enough people vaccinated virus would still spread like wildfire. claim 'hey, vaccinate 100m see goes' makes SENSE. pointless - would protect hundred million, virus would continue circulate unabated (see NYC, one point hardest hit areas 27% test positive antibodies). - people able get vaccine one medical reason another protected all, thanks selfishness ignorance people thought anything common good. concern trolling Sweden months now. Damn right exactly fear happen! FYI, City Toronto by-law goes effect tomorrow mandating masks indoor places. streets Stockholm must littered corpses stage. - 5 million deaths counting? people starts taking vaccine real second wave starts. ask staying air bnb irresponsible. teacher’s union looking forward day return school. Remote teaching pleasant experience. gladly sit traffic every day means students. agree would be, depending type mask is. reusable burning going bring person's family peace means whatever fuck want imo. we've we're going think everyone ever going bring peace even seems idiotic. Yeah - Monday - Wednesday always low days always seem process least amount tests Sunday-Tuesday...

The real number concern FL still inching upwards positivity - July 5th tests/today's posted results 14.97% Turing test recently? rate matter. want population stay shut businesses. rate .07 percent think smart go shutdown? risks everything. analyzing risk important part every day life choices make. rate matter.  people saying can't breathe mask bet wear face shield either..... people selfish asshats, American full em unfortunately fully agree hours worked. better. 40+, heck 50-60 hours many cases parents isn’t feasible rearing family. bad job resume takes years correct. 

Lie. long lying life-and-death matters, better top government officials.

(In seriousness, *actually* put verifiable falsehoods CV; sometimes creative career repair necessary chat offline works doesn't— moral qualms helping people bad situations.) Love gov breathe mouth? I'm exercising. seriously dense?

 realise controlled laboratory conditions one beginning steps dedinite final step? Lol 2 day counties gone silent. Everyone... Died. No, reporting two Toronto hospitals COVID 19 patients ICU. none hospitalized all, none ICU all. still quite lot better ago. agree direct access patients, think making menial labor around hospital would good punishment. Make change beds, clean bathrooms, mop floors, etc. supervision.  CCP also run scientists engineers. Sure lot political talking heads real crises, guess Xi listening to?

It's surprise locked Wuhan early. oops. replace state city. advice would still help. Lol. realized allowing get sick actually kind pointless. like going access things masked people already access to... still end required wear mask public places anyway. Also, people still think reckless asshole try go maskless.  Yes. feel good therapeutics ease pressure vaccine research. deaths spike up, worry vaccine may rushed. need vaccine bad side effects. live MO, grow here. folks certainly different stripe downstate MO compared cities, call morons. think clear message article complete lack leadership unwillingness anything might even remotely unpopular ""leaders"" might well subsequent elections.

I think leaders explain things people, give solid justifications things done, go along it. new virus found called g4 

I think meant g5 ;) u/Tom_Hanks_

Yea alot bureaucratic one could imagine. states/regions, FHM government pretty slow n bloated even feels tepid n slow. bottom line everything points towards disaster a

Except fact Covid death rate steadily dropping past month despite openings protests.

It's currently lowest since things started.

I would say *that* doesnt ""point towards disaster"". I'm basically boat (caught March, weeks pneumonia, bronchitis, relatively speaking badly off) seems nebulous autoimmune issues dealing got cranked 11 - daily clusters focal seizures, hand foot joints inflamed painful, skin delicate bruise literally reason, can't trust remember instructions finish tasks. Feels like covid pushed self-destruct button way nobody really taking seriously ""you got covid months ago"" ""you're anxious read many medical journals"". read journals try figure what's going on!

Best figure nascent lupus and/or rheumatoid arthritis prior covid, slow-start type ramping bit bit years. Covid seems turned ""fuck you"" type instead. Well reduces severity potentially lethal line moderate bad cold, I'll take it. would largely bring situation back control. Two weeks! Yes have. 1 minute talking patient. Laying iv taking blood.

Reading lab results easy too. rocket science. trained ape could it. isnt r/politics, thats likely stuff getting taken down. course related. explained related prior comment. feel like I'm talking Zoolander even bill tbh words population density far determinative terms deaths mask wearing, lockdowns, etc?  think virus first took major way China govt bears responsibility handling poorly regardless whether originated there. suppressed talking it, censored doctors, allowed flights Wuhan, etc. Can't blame US anyone else. Contributing yes, causal? Data timeline asserts otherwise. shocking part go almost nobody wears mask. time time see old person wearing one like people behave like nothing happening all.

In Spain, wearing mask almost mandatory. sweden life goes like normal. Also move car get flat spots tired. Good know thanks

Definitely seemed tyrant anti-drug crusade though  looks like less buff Arnold. death rates rise every decade 20? pretty widely accepted fact. ever actually test positive COVID? know tested negative twice, I’m wondering kept testing destroying neighborhoods so. Hotels zoned it, quiet residential neighborhoods bunch new tourists every night.

Nothing makes happy anymore. Videogames boring, tv mind numbing, books impossible sit through. I've forced go back well many times they're tiring. think lot value came knowledge could something productive wasn't, I've got nothing they're meaningless me.

It's 100% accurate, globally say modern China primarily led engineers (and lawyers economists), US led lawyers (and celebrities). CCP done great job undermining global organizations. recent victim. TBH don’t feel sorry surge states saw bad got big cities (Chicago, New York) ignored all. themselves, made bed sleep it. Beyond better understanding care, wonder spike primarily one area (NY/NJ) 1/2 - 3/5s daily deaths. multiple spikes across country. beds started run out, higher daily death rates hit. big differences nursing care likely curb dramatic rise. Limit access vulnerable, lower deaths.

In order.
In Europe start effective. possible go second effective. Sometimes option go third. us logical.

In US skip first two get obsessed third option. make much sense here. Youre right people hate something questioned becomes problematic. thought internet nazi Germany holy hell. That's hilarious.

They ask population report intrusions (""Siden 3. juli har politiet Finnmark fått tips daglig om utenlandske turister som oppholder seg deres distrikt.""). Fun fun fun. yes DK apparently temporary emergency solution vacation, safer flying Spain... Don’t think mob acting “brain dead” leaving responsible citizen literally brain dead bit ironic? Bad immigrants like you? Could expand methodological faults found reading study? I’m talking numbers weekend, July 4-5. Deaths low unless someone point specific examples states haven’t reported. Poor leadership real answer. 

To American people’s credit, didn’t follow leader though issues like masks shutting down. wouldn’t disparage them. listened CDC politicians. believe Tom Hanks part satanic keep spewing type stuff? know there's hell lot dies lives. Stop ridiculous statements start living reality. regular person interested topic special interest Sweden.

Sorry use lame vulgar trope true. 

Black white defensive thinking makes people say ""What supposed eat kale?"" ""I feel healthier eating meat, vegetarian work me,"" ""my uncle owns farm happy animals live healthy lives."" 

Ok.

People need understand two choices life. people could cut meat portions half satisfied adjustment period. 

*This going keep happening.* 

We can't anything China. something factory farming home starts decreasing demand. even budge, little, entire identity wrapped around able exactly want exact amounts it? compromise?

But please, keep citing lower deaths, encourage people keep going get thing. like think point, every world leader would like ""Nah, I'm good.""

Heck, IIRC even buddy Kim Jong-Un turned down. ""Sorey"" person responded referred ""complete idiots running country"" US distinct reference Trump government currently running country. 

They literally compared Trump Trudeau leaders calling Trump idiot running country joined saying Canada also chosen idiot.

I understand made poor decisions leading, respect opinions Trudeau leader, one clearly idiotic track record consider equitable. one knows long term look like since good data immunity looks like. post article earlier today MSB gives different projections Sweden's possible outcomes: good, two not. doomed true. Even eliminate locally could come back frozen meat appears. muslims, France specifically straight racist policies toward Islamic religions. coincidence majority terrorist attacks last decade. things dont mean anything.

Nah I'll blame Americans. Fuck us.

We especially stupid anti-intellectual compared rest world. ability wrong thing dumbass pretenses every single time truly exceptional.

26% Americans believe sun revolves around earth. especially stupid anti-scientific culture among developed world stupified inaction TV internet political culture decades.

We're loud, annoying, dumb fuck, lack basic human decency care fucking neighbor's health, showed perfectly comment.

Nah, fuck this. we've learned Ebola decides become hyper virulent, country one earth absolutely devastated year massive portion population conditioned deny GERM THEORY. worst way discourse internet drop links people IMO Corona bad = Fauci

Corona good = Donny Keep pleading. lot people homeless mentally ill. Many get horrible side effects medication, permanent, require another med combat side effect first med, may require third med combat side effects 2nd med, etc, refuse take meds. 

You basically screwed getting housing help known mental illness &amp; unwilling take meds. option inpatient setting &amp; forced take meds appealing them, I'm sure understand. choose homeless. mentally ill myself, choice, understand choose it, though make sad. There’s much time day to. people “suffering” working remote need mix up, even it’s smallest task. holy shit took look. think say death's start rising? Europe. Mortality rates normal range month according monitors data mortality rates 24 European countries.

What's even interesting - even pandemic - *no increase mortality rates* period compared previous 3 years.

I quick tally deaths graphs week 45 week 23, inclusive, last four years.

Here's found:

* 2016, Week 45 - 2017 Week 23 : Number deaths = approx 1.9 million
* 2017, Week 45 - 2018 Week 23 : Number deaths = approx 1.8 million
* 2018, Week 45 - 2019 Week 23 : Number deaths = approx 1.8 million
* 2019, Week 45 - 2020 Week 23 : Number deaths = approx 1.8 million

In last four years, majority deaths people aged 65+. means, year, something kills lot elderly people. ***2019/2020 different year.***

As diseases causes regularly kill lot people every single year, overall effect Covid mortality rates across Europe negligible.

A lot countries list lockdown, yet effect overall mortality rates lockdowns lifted, we're looking lower average mortality rates across Europe. work health industry, employer made clear would fire post Facebook. Definitely. cases one person virus several others sitting next near person gotten it. good idea flying days. mean bloodsucking bedbugs? I've never heard biting cockroaches. working hospitals many years, someone passed exam got license, mean still naive idiot. norm means, I've worked ton nurses clearly clue doing. Goes doctors well. nursing/medical programs created equal, everyone makes hard work studying.  10-20% US infected already.

Even US gets 25k daily cases considering extremely high level asymptomatic mild cases extremely unlikely US catching even 1 10 cases. virus surely accelerate well enter fall. US probably seeing 500k cases day back March April. Conservatively additional 10-20% infected October.

Herd immunity coming months.  point, people going extravagant vacations every year extreme wealthy. also contribute climate issues far ways vacation. importantly, testing every 3 days? It’s still minimum 48 hrs turnaround, places 3-5 days. many tests, they’re going end testing people *before* results last tests back. tagline entire year too... earth mean virus discriminate? People power work many others likelihood getting higher, plus get tested better healthcare. relevant Bottoms also far lethal older people, feels like kind discrimination. also hurt black communities more, likely healthcare inequalities, area assume Bottoms covered.

Now argue virus conscious entity targeting groups people. surprising since conscious, can't intend discriminate. outcomes absolutely discriminatory important. I've never local library (not non University one, least). never said get free news lmao. looked up, huh, access every major newspaper think of, either library pressreader, used municipality places. Somehow seems bother you.

But case citizens able access every big paper free Denmark, true Sweden, equally shit? another twist ready throw free access information, populace educated could uneducated populace tends uncritical often unable discern problems within guess makes sense, Swedish news available extent Nordic people, possibly reason frequently proven fundamentally flawed perception part world.

That, get every newspaper free US either... High academic standards.

The death count COVID likely even higher include people would died anyway. second derivative stabilized constant! Pfizer like....we got premium shit here... know wrong stupid party. assume people Social Security/Medicare first line plebes get it. Fuck outta here. I'm willing wear mask stop spread coming months soon vaccine, i'm never wearing one again. 

This people covid restrictions masks. people keep changing goalposts. Propaganda powerful tool. Social media online news weaponized. Hell, stuff Cambridge Analytica essentially military grade psy ops stuff, I'm sure evolved since then. 

We like think we're smart enough pierce fog laser intensity intellect, realistically us even bright enough evade hype marketing, let alone something perniciously targeted.

You two talking two different points. RussianBotAccount45 talking public availability mass immunization general public.

You talking ***production*** vaccine. still produce vaccine hopes/preparation positive outcome Oxford Trials come saying effective. left bunch vaccines can't use. bet Oxford Vaccine best option viable. want wait trials results **then** start making vaccine, waited months jackshit hedging bet vaccines local pharmacy next day vaccine proved effective safe. 

Here two bbc articles talking *timeline vaccine possible date *First vaccine test group, funding, larger groups availability* Illinois opening up, less less deaths. blows hypothesis. European soccer works fine... Stating obvious seems thread today’s news... I'm bit situation. We're holding taking another look Fall (Sept/Oct). Fines quarantines offenders fix masks get better. Covette happening right now! Honestly feel really badly family. clearly mental break needs professional help.

That fantastic actor. mobile, copy/paste me. Anyways, thanks! don’t think people realize massive lifestyle shift shit going require. COVID stay, is, we’re going reorder entire society. man defended brother sheriff investigated scene. I... Google picayune. hear girl 20’s heart stint put multiple heart attacks caused virus? teenager/early twenties girl complete lung transplant many holes lungs lungs literally sticking ribcage? mention scientists seeing signs long term health problems young people barely even showed signs? Also, numbers infected young persons go up, death percentage rise. weren’t majority group infected Ramming legislation via OIC instead going proper channels (and ignoring empirical data, spending fortune well straight lying public House Commons) big red flag IMO.

Yes agree palatable options.

This *gun thing* could well make hard right swing, like long gun registry (this one shaping bigger boondoggle registry was). dropping prop rep they've made less untouchables lot voters soon a, especially gun thing could left well enough along since legitimately measurable impact public safety, spent time effort border/gangs would actually impact. Yea likely. feels like conspiracy bullshit going here. 100% feelings ""it's obvious"" zero actual data used. That's... kinda big issue system though, it. That's rather like saying dictatorships work dictator benevolent. Like yep, story checks out, that's gonna work. Buuuut 10 years he's corrupted power and/or next guy, nobody chose, corrupt. Woops. Guess work outside ideal situation.

I would argue democracy best form government we've seen far. best shitty option shitty options. shiniest turd. I'm definitely convinced that's truly case. another form government starts supplant democracy, I'd willing entertain idea better, democracy simply good. None are.  blaming generation. simply responding calling young people spoiled trying live lives, generations immediately (including mine, Gen X, much better).  want kill us, deserve it. could done much better, didn't. Fuck us all! Besides, see people wearing masks public, overwhelmingly young people. Boomers overwhelmingly rejecting them, tend support politicians leading charge anti-scientific disinformation. let's throw stones live glass houses. That’s why. Bad people don’t die easy. Trump suffer someday though. can’t bad shit suffer sickness also knows hurts takes keep quite. seeing numbers? true sizable percentage articles discussion posted here? Yeah, think officially consider pandemic ""over,"" there's vaccine events like concerts games, without masks distancing, occur without worry. People probably pretty worried first time think we'll relieved. even go sucks people can't. seen Road Perdition Lady Killers? plays villain films.  There's chance herd immunity six months, Gotlieb obviously idiot, he's dead wrong everything everytime makes comment. vaccine masses six months either Gotlieb wrong again. Correct, exponential rate COVID cases increasing stabilized. he’s technically lying. can’t make shit anymore. Administration might want consider sailing USNS Comfort hospital ship Houston Ship Channel.  Sounds like Texas Medical Center could use help. paper commenter quoted saying.

There usually staff ones work kids though. means somebody coughs hangs air sometime maybe even gets transported somebody breathes in.

That exactly scientists meant ""microdroplets"" months ago. Microdroplets small keep hanging air long time, especially indoors airflow.

Harvard, parents make &lt; $150,000/year, pay less 10% full tuition. parents make &lt; $65,000/year, free.

I'm fan many policies, tend lean much left, he's earned respect he's handled crisis. Giving Trump ""heck no"" confirms further. know trite, much, much younger asbestos lead abatement. wear something like [this bad suit Tyvek.

There professions wear kind PPE day long, day in, day out.

Wearing [one half hour go store? even register. honestly know everyone finds inconvenience. basically like breathing without mask humid, still summer day one curses atmosphere happens. Nice work. I'm smoker too, switched vape well dropping booze. Yep. Trudeau made exception rules attend protest rally, I'm sure could've broken rules wanted this. So, basically, even schools open partially (to keep international population), international kids (mostly color) forced come campus pandemic spread (mostly, thanks great American patriots refuse wear mask socially distance), turn lead deaths international students community.

Brilliant. So, Trump administration finally worked way reduce intellectual competition. TWELVE HOSPITALS?? vcan always put another coat on. There's many clothes take aren’t dramatic. You’re denial.

*Laughs virus* can't contact trace people tested Today learned masks cause unemployment Mother nurse, Id slap 2nd degree murder. 
It's horrific happened, monster president Trump must held accountable, must meet justice spreading propaganda effects American people. wants help? hell wrong people? stupid opened, wide open soon, nobody going help. keep stupid stuff over. people, stuff. sympathy. None. Okay, I’ve gotten sick life flu. year got flu shot. don’t expect coronavirus vaccine saving grace top off... **this official covid19 sub reddit**. **official** **official** stance allow people share actual relevant facts information political. Better censor things pretend reality political dare risk people whole story. places can’t even live masks minute... Ya, US companies used violating law; get caught getting fined 1-10% profits... dissuade them. sure

I guarantee people hear name Astrazenca associated producing vaccine saved world, absolutely score brand recognition seems pretty low risk, Korea call center case study, 79 infected individuals working call center, 0.3% people tested sharing elevators/lobby tested positive. nice illustrations. wearing mask risk reduced significantly.

Edit: 0.3% 0.03%, I'm sorry! I'm sorry funny farm? babies. need escort us country going allow that. 

Maybe week heard. Let sheepdogs drive mounties may invlined follow.

Mount gps cars well. jail cool island somewhere, place violators without due process think cool snazzy name dont raise fuss. Yes will. won’t. want logic?

Ok. Right lowest death count since Covid began.

That means whatever happening hospital beds *now* result behaviour happening *country* 3 - 4 weeks ago.

So happening country around 6th 14th June would result lowest Covid death rate months?

Because whatever going 3 weeks ago *amazing*, whatever behaviour *not good*, death rate higher.

Because best rates months, result behaviour approximately 1 month ago.

So go. logic you. Whatever behaviour USA middle June *waaaaay* effective reducing Covid deaths whatever happening middle May April. great! Whatever people doing, again. sort issues seeing asymptomatics? know studies shown many pneumonia. Sorry. Yes younger kids. thinking college age students vastly overestimate people. Here’s incoherent logic: see people protests still spreading it, stop hypocritical let people get hair cut.  Count calories alcoholic drinks one night likely far significant milkshake. would argue one negative places read coronavirus news. they're purposely obtuse.

Place feels like herd Eeyores days Trudeau: Oh thank gods excuse! Interesting perspective! Bus driver would've shot injured America. trump: *cough ""come man, got hamberders"" *cough *sniff

Gottlieb said ends 6 months matter what.

Either vaccine arrives next couple months US reaches herd immunity. That's honest response this. Many kids die enclosing classroom home. Fuck ""risk either way"" need education critical thinking man grey shirt husband? defeated, hopeless eyes  wrong....... go full stop say completely gone Florida, it! Open everything let's get back normal. /s data point doesn’t fit narrative I’m gonna count it! Mostly i've read require masks kids... hard isn’t superbug... it’s novel coronavirus problem novel. it’s hardly sophisticated super resistance clever organism. havent worked once. stopped one bad habit. I've sedentary ever life. There's barely enough capacity take tests weekly. Large cities approaching one week results. Nurses hospitals waiting days get results. 

Every three days student campus literally lying. Wha us non-swedes? see ""jaoj ijaoji tjabi mejmo tjatja hejmo anvan geirshjon"". story isn’t true. Totally No.

I don’t really see happening. Flumeñco Perhaps 10 week decrease deaths correlated 12 weeks hard hit areas lockdown? Well first make AIDS vaccine considering syndrome caused HIV.

Better treatments, using safety gear, social distancing, lockdowns long let hospitals catch up.

Now virus catching up. Hey Trump take note

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Shutdown 3 weeks minimum, ramp testing mask requirements business restrictions SLOWLY open businesses areas public. comparison what? increases vaccine demand. Ha, thanks. asymptomatic...so love God, get tested covid? exposed someone covid? feel like randomly waking one morning saying get tested covid today?

I always get confused see news headlines like explanation got tested first place never displayed illness. Masks meant protect others. Everyone around wears masks. Lack side effects long term sequelae, chiefly.


And oh, vastly reduced fatality proportion. Actually it’s lifted time. People started ignoring lockdown may. People won’t reorder society, seen past weeks. Except past weeks shown wrong. New cases clear, huge shift age, maintained entire recent surge. Wow insane. makes zero sense.

At least acknowledge prepare possible turn worse.

Edit: added possible Yeah need pony, good luck. love french Canadian women masks. sayin. herd immunity slows it.

The thing making crisis fast spreads overloading hospitals. he’d immunity kicks enough slowly enough prevent this, see people returning normal pretty quickly Sounds like I've 8 years now...jeesh Oh, don’t get wrong. know accept best best. falsely pressured comment saying let certain amount regardless test scores. 

A momentary lapse, totally see saying. Shouldn’t deploying federal field hospitals? b-but long time ago!!!1! makes OK!!! Lolwut part executive order issued Monday, school districts charter school governing boards must open brick mortar schools least five days per week students August.

It's nice make 6 days week. absolutely looked American people. Raised median income people. Given historic grants HBCU’s, pre Covid best economy U.S seen years, historic minority unemployment, punishing political figures China suspending visas role Hong Kong, he’s done yet. He’s raised, I’m sorry feel way. partied first month actually turned drinking. drinking shift work week different drinking worked gym shorts day. Less satisfaction already sat around comfortably day. pretty well established takes around 3 weeks someone die (typically, obviously there's huge range; broadway actor died battling since March). 

Moreover, death, still takes weeks death make official takes time, sometimes weeks, doctors fill death certificates health officials adjudicate deaths. finally added official state important note take several weeks death records submitted National Center Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, tabulated.


And huge uptick cases going weeks. total 200,000 coronavirus cases Florida recorded last two weeks.

BTW, Florida STILL adding deaths early Yay totals. states lag SIGNIFICANT amount time reporting deaths. thing. think you’re likely infected, pretty much responsible course action get tested stay away others meantime. doubt happen Yep. couple studies underway mucosal immunity, really cool adenovirus vector vaccine shows promise generating ton IgA. That’s good guess. Wouldn’t better use resources save tests online learning? partial online classes? I'm sure happen way, picture head Trudeau Trump negotiating Trudeau says ""okay, we'll let put name last agree small list concessions"" Trump says ""deal"" turns someone behind says ""this kid knows nothing marketing."" Meanwhile I've got provider trying put wife drug requiring urinalysis there's alternatives instead. want enter facility high risk. Provider keeps trying push one particular drug whatever reason. ""it's best"".

We asked absolutely adamant drug requiring urinalysis would provide curbside service. could cover sheet could provided sample. told giving ultimatum. Meanwhile want see us face face yet take risks?

 Ultimatum lives cost benefit ratio worth it.

Just context mental health drug like life threatening issue anyone concerned. think mental illness education particular case, though may narcissism. think white privilege &amp; think that's classed mental illness. 

I think whole religious thing gives hope &amp; nothing that, though I'm religious. “1%” figure bandied long virus around, lot seems based assumptions many undiagnosed cases there. But, amount testing gone every country, measured CFR hasn’t dropped much one would expect. I’m betting see much higher. I'd say post read work. PM I'll correct you. exact way Government responded everything pandemic. Every American made powerless actions. protect life, risk life someone else's profit. true, people get 4 years anyway. Plenty people take gap years start kindergarten late. loved college, took one class online swore never again. get works lot people, way experience. would personally wait stable better experience. say, father took sister back university US back Germany, April.
He said health system way better back home. hospitals ""approaching capacity"" now. theory hospitals approaching capacity level time? 

I want actual reasons alarmed, over-dramatic headlines. Wake actually hit capacity.  Actually, suggestion isn’t logically obvious all. Higher fraction death ICU would mean patients poor outcomes even ICU care put ICU. putting patients ICU didn’t kill them, would died ICU anyways. isn’t “right” percentage patients put ICU. 80% death rate patients ICU (as hospitals Italy height pandemic there) isn’t “better”, means lot patients poor prognosis put ICU. Separating died frail handle ventilator, survived despite poor outlook really difficult. 

Also, “predicted” percentage ICU patients model extrapolated whatever data modelers used make model, probably coming Wuhan Italy, reflects admission criteria places. model doesn’t know “correct” percentage ICU admissions. They’re treating well except forcing back packed classroom social distancing PPE requirements saying don’t go you’ll fired unemployment options. Doesn’t sound great.   Filing complaint licensing board would good first step. BoJo's fiance it. Trudeau. think safe reference The_D Trump. Remind Me! 3 months Yes, is. Janeway published pretty good immu textbook, highly recommend reorder society Spanish flu...which even deadlier? church purposefully infects kids disease known kill probably shut down. Sue pastors, sue church, arrest mother negligence. saying 20 every 100 people test positive covid need hospitalization?

People travel far Europe, experience. large number Americans never even left county, let alone state. we're brainwashing people essentially. post articles correct information let people make decisions, provided following local mandates? Dont tell Americans Dawg, that’s ignorant scientifically factual. decent university would extend deadline they’ve made policy clear. want closer god, you? didn’t blackface? redditors give guy 55k upvotes thought redditors racism I'm denying much want see American experiment crumble, wish death peers neighbors. fuckers shit birds backpedal, might even pay actions hands grieving families, going bemoan fuckers finally getting glimmer conscience what's right.

Friday’s video, Father Sergiy denounced President Vladimir Putin “traitor Motherland” serving Satanic “world government” dismissed Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill top clerics “heretics” “enemies God Holy Mother God” must “thrown out.”

The monk called all-Russia assembly put Putin, Patriarch Kirill entourage trial prevent plunging country civil war. “We can’t allow wolf pack mangle Russia neighboring nations,” said. ...

Father Sergiy, born Nikolai Romanov, served police officer Soviet times, left ranks sentenced 13 years prison charges robbery assault. release, joined church school later became monk.

The charismatic monk quickly became widely known enthusiastic efforts open new churches monasteries Urals. fiery sermons, denounced alleged plots “world government” glorified Russia’s last czar, Nicholas II, killed Bolsheviks along entire family Yekaterinburg 1918.

Father Sergiy visible outspoken ultra-conservative Russian Orthodox clerics challenged church leadership. top church hierarchy avoided conflict monk openly defied Kremlin Moscow Patriarchy coronavirus pandemic.

As contagion engulfed Russia, Father Sergiy declared coronavirus non-existent denounced electronic passes introduced Moscow regions stem outbreak “Satan’s electronic camp.” monk described vaccines developed COVID-19 part global plot control masses via chips.

He also urged believers to disobey closure churches during nationwide lockdown. Orthodox churches across Russia closed parishioners April 13 amid quick rise COVID-19 cases allowed reopen early June authorities eased restrictions.

Speaking video monastic cell icons images Orthodox Church hierarchs past adorn wall alongside pictures Russia’s last Czar Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, Father Sergiy warned church officials need seize monastery force get out.

“I’m calling Orthodox believers come defend monastery,” said latest video. “I leave monastery.” ] Pst, that's joke. could probably get away sending cardboard cutout. Measles bad analogy might think, way. SARS 2 measles virus look really high attack rates airborne transmission. Good thing church running country. think getting unlikely vaccine. vaccine offers protection 2-3 months they've seen natural immunity, basically useless. I'm afraid conditions living right new normal miracle happens. home (depending home country ) 14 days quarantine waiting. American, reject fact would bad economy. /s “It’s stabilized” means we’re consistently testing ~15% positive adding 6000-12,000 cases day, totally stable rate. 

Do 45 DeSatan know word “stable” means? 

*iwannadie*

You know, things actually fairly stable Hillsborough re-opened. still screenshot one daily reports. wish could go back that. It’s max per day. Expect 10 time Isn’t it’s largely circulatory virus opposed respiratory virus? Yup, they’ve already started last week. Thousands openings posted recruit nurses states. Normally need Texas nursing license practice Texas; waived requirement week. That’s exactly happened NY. Cloth masks stop many droplets emitted mouth speaking / coughing, contain lot virus person infected. droplets thought main vector transmission covid-19. mean theft technically held onto delivered end? got nothing 🤷🏼‍♀️ imagine headlines? “Cancer patients allowed treated Covid treating hospitals test positive coronavirus.” would nursing home/ rehab center debacle. 

Besides months ago knew almost nothing virus knew immunocompromised people mote likely die. one wants patient get infected treated cancer. Even parts kids disabilities issues things touching face getting kids wear facemasks.

Not comment adds anything conversation, come makers stupid. Wear mask. wasnt president though, CDC actually developed vaccine MERS already undergone lot testing required, it’s almost ready go need test effectiveness COVID-19 missing point - unlikely goodness hearts rather profit. 

As turns out, expect make profit yearly vaccines. Yes. lockdowns especially hard fast borders closed relatively quickly. Speed probably bigger factor aggression. apparently can't post certain words subreddit posts automatically removed ""political"". Sure, let's talk CAUSE dumbf\*ckery might spreading misinfo virus. Let's pretend irrelevant fact US failing badly every civilized country track control COVID. smh Per Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel American Immigraiton almost certainly going challenged court. can't give anyone specific legal advice cases (especially expert student visas), encourage anyone book flight ""home"" exact moment.

US shoots foot. hope Americans realize people US would third world country right now... love article uses exact phrase “bode well”. Nice. Good points Correct. That's included word plausible post---so much still unknown. still take hug :) :)

Edit: deep dived red pandas saying species. get though, I've never afraid virus, need live life best can. 

Never problem masks. 

I think refusing wear mask ignorance stupidity fear. I'm sure Reddit find way blame America this.  crazy, talking someone works outpatient eye surgery center, person says every patient tested allowed surgery; patients ended testing positive (presumably asymptomatic).

So people getting tested get elective surgery, people sick, think it, fight tooth nail get tested. there's indication does. 

It seems like like inoculates people others, rather lessening symptoms. Evil enough... low energy US 20k new cases per day plateau 2 months (before recent spike), yet deaths kept falling. seems hard believe. testing lot children? Interesting. didn’t think home based lab research. Maybe go hours every week work? would also mean every 33 year old testing positive, 9 year old ever 50 year old -9 year old two 7.5 year olds

It's one other. can't highly infectious novel virus take years plural reach herd immunity. works.

It’s likely true he’s trying make look like isn’t issue since virus affects younger folks less severely isn’t always case anyway. bunch money that's really missing now. current spike rise happened past week so.   Lol seen Trumps latest tweets?

America shit show all. already know think. Gram up, douche. People complaining Florida first holding spring break, opening beaches early, time lauding Denmark “model response” Denmark deaths per capita Florida. population density. friend mine texted liberal friend several weeks ago “The president said go back offices now, need three feet apart, don’t need wear masks” friend replied idiot would kill us all. truth was, Denmark’s plan, everyone ok comes L source. Florida actually remained stable daily new cases despite everyone’s criticisms heat hit people started spending time indoors. 

People still lauding Cuomo’s response state worst outbreak. get it, New York City isn’t like American city, compared peer cities across world, also performed poorly. Yes eventually slowed down, month ago 1 5 New Yorkers tested positive antibodies. half way herd immunity. course spread slowing NYC many immune people walking around!

I expat Canadian talk Canadians every single day. experience virus terms lifestyle extremely similar mine. mobility data supports that.

And despite stereotype “anti-science sentiments”, Americans wear masks public spaces average Canadians. spin.  Sure. one. isnt acceptable. Neither racist retweeting video followers yelling ""white power"" removing 3 hours, calling nazis ""fine people"" (by reaching theoretical upper limit infection rate)

psst buddy, want that. ""theoretical"" upper limit entire population. things work well moment right... empty streets Broadway sad see. Broadway closed least 2021. know nurses like that. nurse friends HATE can't stand damage Wife nurse.

Yep AntiVaxxer nurses. shit ton. keep mouth shut hospital (ie don’t tell patient parent do). Thank God.

Unfortunately much keep mouth shut let social media. far realistic timeline people seem think (vaccine fall). 

Of course, likelihood mask wearing distancing year. people going skip family Christmas year, almost one willing next year. degree social distancing

You think they're going allow us open hotels, tourism, flying, sports, concerts, events, weddings, parties, etc... masks? missing statement social distancing.. Yeah saw expected girl thinks rules don’t apply her. According friend it’s still on. least one press conference looked crowded wearing masks. I'm sure number similar conferences gone Atlanta. friends exact type people causing surge cases, nobody willing make sacrifices going keep getting worse Orange County, though. unique position never daily new cases drop. We'd steady climb upwards across measures. health director resigned June 8th due doxxed board meeting getting death threats anti-mask stalkers home. mask order rescinded, people bars restaurants house parties/events explosive hospitalization increases, accelerating case growth 18 44. wrong. Vaccine finished 52 distributed en masse 55. person responding said years distributed true. 1950s standards bad. turn around 30ish months impressive. logistically much advanced today.


When started working vaccine irrelevant notion finished vaccine distributed quickly. Talking long vaccine took create specious line comments. Noooo love her!

At time, typhus thing. Typhus needed boosters every six months. world went on. People followed rules die it. Fauci old enough educated enough, makes wonder he's acting stupid. think Bane turned crime man?

Couldn't ever get past interview Upton Sinclair right meat packing industry all. One hundred years later - poor (and mostly immigrant) workers putting food tables. Yet they’re still treated like crap. 😩 likely it! certainly true average age identified cases younger treatments improved. next two weeks informative. bet deaths climb, frightening speed cases.  hope fun talking shit standing pile corpses

He thinks talking brigading downvoting every post/comment, talking 10yrs10days paid influnecer account spread propaganda months quickly look posts comments recognise agenda therefore discussion/defense worthless. Speaking going according plan, isnt vaccine producing antibodies generally better expected? well then... completely agree. I'm blown away people think disappear. 

Management have. everyone stops living dream world, much better chance lowering death rate (maybe even manage problems come) experience community college biology lot people extreme cognitive dissonance, pass courses fine, dont believe anything study.

Add level stupidity Trump cultist thrown in, sadly doesnt surprise No, [redacted] supporters political point push told that. Anyone paying attention reality believes science facts would told unproved dangerous.

No, need keep one available wind situation one worn. bad that, takes seconds throw one on. That’s exactly said  do, born china happy see motherland prosper, lay person, think ccp great country ever since Deng took over, therefore im pro Beijing makes say deaths lag 4-5 weeks? 

Early pandemic, increases deaths lagged increases cases 7 days, like clockwork. vastly increased testing makes sense lag would longer now, 5 week lag seems very, long. Wouldn’t indicate people sick almost two months dying (accounting 1-2 weeks infected developing symptoms, getting positive test). 

Cases started going sun belt states around week May 26 (it’s hard see national numbers northeast still way time, canceled out). puts us week 7... agree expect deaths start rising (or least level off) soon, it’s also clear direct relationship cases deaths saw beginning pandemic doesn’t exist anymore.

If think change comes easily getting organized working civilly ""get changed"", tell peaceful demonstrations years done minority groups got violently shut governments. Tell people saying legalize prostitution drugs decades still seen little hint progress.

Change often hard fought decades centuries numerous people giving freedom even lives name it. easy simply saying: ""Well follow laws agree long surely change!"" likely result would getting incarcerated.

As stated earlier tremendous number unknowns. don;t really know ratio. don;t know case counts 6 weeks 6 months now. don;t know wins election. don;t know policy changes come January. know vaccine coming ever. know long immunity lasts. know antibody tests covering forms immunity. don;t know we'll protests riots, schools going back, little kids efficient spreaders.

When asked, “As may know, health reform bill signed law 2010. Given know health reform law, generally favorable generally unfavorable opinion it?”

More Americans unfavorable opinion recently.[1]

The fact is, public opinion malleable. comes hypothetical healthcare plans people understand concrete proposals debated media, public opinion polling almost useless.

Racists idiots. matter many times post two articles, become ""common problem"" even hard try it. people might look second time someone mask, would see someone dress ""normal"", probably anymore since see people masks time (at least Stockholm). CDC says receptive anal intercourse 17-29 times likely transmit HIV per exposure Receptive Penile-Vaginal Intercourse Insertive Penile-Vaginal Intercourse, respectively.

I'm trouble finding information many doses available long take distribute people anyone else pissed he'd even consider visiting White House Donald Trump president? know argument nothing mine. Even statements mention system good avoid (I guess enough), still deal reality live in. reality whole thing make sense. 

Heck even making argument one arguing wondering gone long this. Warm, moist air coming unmasked trumphole. Good call Justin. Herd immunity requires something like population antibodies. isn’t state US anywhere near that. guess MI still well 10%. Mark speaking, please tell may direct call? Idk heard Wilson narc. government supplements income help people stay home, get. 
Big ups Canada right. Mistakes made, claim local leaders. 

Only one mistake made, elected narcissistic orange baboon baby man. Maybe next time, elect someone lower IQ anyone entire state. I’m actually supportive Wet’suwet’en people BC, also supportive indigenous rights freedoms. many friends Victoria protested properly effectively outside parliament (sleeping outside week).

The rail blockades logistical nightmare, lots people’s livelihoods depend CP railway. Canada sparsely populated country, need railway transport goods.

Just didn’t support rail blockades, doesn’t mean I’m sympathetic towards indigenous population. Schools going open America needs daycare tens millions children, safe. 

I mean come on. normal year schools like ""we're bake sale buy crayons"" think somehow going money/space/time keep school safe pandemic virus? disingenuous post keeping lockdowns health reasons time spouting much enjoying solitary environment. almost people dont really give fuck people’s health want lockdown continue continue nothing value lives.

Its like saying you’re McDonalds cause heart disease found stock Burger King. Yeah. get give, guess. Quebecer, funny see shoe foot days. fine now, hospital, quite simple. Haha FL awful excusing people don’t wear mask could argue direct threat someone doesn’t virus. disability would something along lines COPD Ot Emphysema wearing mask would clearly reasonable accommodation someone doesn’t virus. alternatives: using face shield tolerated, using appointment system, shopping phone Admitting you’re going also bannable offense. Ive reported post. Getting sick politicization pandemic. Another factor better treatment. Docs/medical teams time cases try different therapies drug combos. might realistic naive testing solution.
But take technological breakthroughs.

The availability cheap quick reasonably accurate test require medical resources would massively beneficial testing workplace/schools/hospitals/etc seems mostly line big Italian study Yes hugging normal greet Sweden... hostile towards people masks... probably everywhere else. issue people wear masks always stupid people.

Life much normal Sweden. keep distance, avoid public transports etc.

I say enough done fully support Swedish actions much speculations views seed ah strategy true.

Numbers look better could used tactic aligned better rest Europe I’ll suggestion censorship.

I think would instance justified censorship phrase extremely offensive people pre-existing conditions loved ones.

To put different light, mods would (rightly) ban said gay bottoms way HIV/AIDS crisis 80’s. statement literally 100% false? No. it’s helpful constructive. US harder time dealing COVID many European nations? I've gone many theories ridiculous:

1. Europeans wear masks - US considerably ahead UK mask usage, little behind France, leagues Scandinavian countries, even much higher Canada

2. US at-risk (due factors like obesity), people symptomatic/severe cases, therefore tested - Europe actually similar US terms % at-risk population

3. US opened early - cases, true. cases, cities US lower cases per capita European countries reopened 

Please keep political points facts - I'm policy impacts, much interest blanket bashing politicians (without data clear points policy)  does, go Banff. honestly think way lot people view masks actually adding problem. ""wearing mask I'm alright"" terrible attitude. level people pushing effective method create false sense security.

The latter far true. people opt masks *in place of* social distancing methods, cases still rise. see people masks, there's always one that's either covering nose, touching outside every minutes. States equal Federal Govt. 
who moron now?

State local require masks. President federal Govt NOT. Fact partisan bullshit right here. virus give crap gatherings reason them. fuck easily accessible anybody else. Ironic china's elite universities back operating full capacity. flattened smashed curve. That's crazy part, right? literally things help.

You ever something use years years, day finally toss want use like never before? think exactly what's happening. People survive years without vacation told ""No,"" everyone immediately needs party vacation. Sounds fishy me. Canada: ""I SAID GOOD DAY!"" quick google search reveals tobacco smoke like 0.25 micron, virus like 0.1 microns. Please correct i'm wrong. here, since asthma makes high-risk, wear mask anyway, order curbside delivery, stay home. 

I find dumbfounding people like us legitimate, medically documented issues still manage Karens freaking out. I'm sad read 100 years since great flu epidemic, problems indoctrination lack informed populace still remain. spreading throughout country... real answer containing controlling covid-19 two-fold:

- wear masks prevent spreading thing air it
- reduce social activity significantly (estimating 50-80%) prevent spreading

Or misunderstanding? leave alone? jerk story. Masks waste everyone's time arrest, claimed arrest cops nazi. love answer!!! True, mostly leaves gasping air rest lives, still know negatives years now. Ok. pleasant day high level Allies clearly right. battlefield schmucks trying kill stranger staying alive long enough go home. Well know Corona airborne travel 10 meters air. takes one sick person spread virus AC system dozens/hundreds get it.

But America cannot accept reality pandemic airborne people know stuff washing hands staying 6 feet away bullshit every single indoor business potential Super Spreader location.  Corporate gave us email essentially telling us force people wear mask spite order state. ignore tell every customer put mask. Sometimes though, I'll get customer refuses--one last noght said medical condition, obviously there's nothing there, since press I'm risking discrimination. condescending way said led believe bullshitting.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* pretty well almost late now, reached tipping point weeks ago Wth know, assume cold flu season, people may susceptible. cringe thinking fall 2020 US wonder hospital bill afford it. Sure, July 4 weekend thousands people likely get infected Miami. Poor Sweden... swear must Russian bot that's trying weaken European relations something, that's reason someone would aggressive negative posts. Like sure understand disagree another countries strategy start repeating ""news stories"" ignore anything positive even put negative twists positive news becomes incredibly weird atleast. reads like think Sweden corrupt country run Hitler, going around old people's homes executing them, absolutely insane immigrant Sweden. ignorant moron, attempting sound educated instead making fool themselves.

The Supreme Court addressed public health issues before, ruling society right infringe individual liberty based reason science.

Jacobson v Massachusetts, 1905 - states right impose criminal penalties failing vaccinated. wanna see happens proper trials?

 agree. made readjust notions what's important vs. purely hedonistic. spend time outside instead watching TV, cook lot more, actual sleep schedule tied insane commutes meeting whiplash. thing really miss can't replicate home able hang friends family person. common people molested raped repeat behaviors adults. see play children tip alot people like parents, teachers etc think normal thats experienced even therapy growing usually stops. Many people raped molested become abusers. know MSW worked victims perps. spread propaganda spread delusions eating babies human sacrifices INSANE especially impressionable young people here. seen wording multiple threads user posted isnt first post exact wording Ivr seen. stupid conspiracy theories. want go real pedofiles look sex offender registry area look damn president sexual interactions young women probably werent age best friend children. christ sakes. cant stand human race. **OK, FOLKS - LET'S STOP BREATHING.** Middle East. sub separate tag India point.  county Latinx 13% population 68% cases. Same, guy big part childhood, like Harrison Ford John Williams. want hear politics enjoy they're part world. Good question. assuming people using brains...more like brain washed. heard many regions Germany exempt children mask rule. look kids (&lt;10) - worst social distancing don’t mind putting masks on. maybe adding children would give 40%? Extroverts finally experience introverts saying (quietly) years - world made oh tables turned!  normal feel gloomy people races, genders, ages, countries effected this. realistically wait vaccine circulate things ""normal"" again. people Walmart given day protests MS. nobody wearing masks here, you’d think didn’t exist. Outdoors lot lower chance transmission anything indoors, one estimation 19 times less likely. wind dissipate virus droplets, UV light sun inactivates also increases Vitamin D, means less likely get sick catch it. person lived means something someone else. One life important another imo age life experience. dunno, grandparents could afford house 4 kids one salesperson's wage. possible now? president trust worthy source on... Well anything. We’re quarantining two weeks starting July 4th. SIL went FL celebrate uncle’s birthday week acted like nothing going flying Trump flags. took plane too.

My BIL hung week later, partied, swam swimming pool.

My MIL said BIL social distancing whole time, yet FB pictures show opposite. she’s lied possibly infected without knowing it. sad cautious since day one. 

My dad work even though he’s overly paranoid super cautious, honestly think husband wants uninvite he’s hurt family can’t come (which decision, didn’t even see FB pictures). 

Ok, fine. 

We six week old, must take seriously. Plus... can’t afford $760k hospital bills right now... ever It’s unnerving people’s symptoms outcomes wildly different inconsistent. I’m glad Tom Hanks made through, scares yesterday [Nick Cordero died 41 90+ ICU Covid. It’s terrifying people mild symptoms, others extreme symptoms. would take probably 10 times space minimum energy density fuel much higher I'm probably lowballing significantly really. would concerned friends anything may encounter campsite. doesn’t sound like they’re incredibly responsible. Sweeds seem rather touchy dont they? Reddit infamous one sided view issues, Sweeds must trouble adjusting new world they're flip side one sided view.

Ironic another thing proves eugenics bad idea (you would think death, evidently them) 

And even want censor lol. possible, get pulse oximeter, measure oxygen saturation levels. could help determine seek medical care, along symptoms like shortness breath, excessive fatigue normal things (climbing stairs, etc), pain back, etc. doctor told seek help O2 levels fell 88, people reddits suggested 92. 

Generally speaking, worsening symptoms, occur all, start somewhere 7-10 day period.  someone living United States, it’s still confusing disappointing. Capitalistic America kill you. Haha shit... me. totally read original post mean 7-10 days infection, 7-10 first 5 days. see intended meaning now. son autism he’ll never wear mask. go accommodate him. wife always wear mask avoid going places son would need wear mask. know soon might told can’t come know I’ll upset know thing happen lives Covid not. July filled announcements like this.  honestly getting kind weird, soon there's going civil wars entirely within US, masked maskless. Exactly. can. cases Covid positive person sitting next AC intake restaurant spread others restaurant. 2nd wave come. dumbest thing ive read reddit today. Literally every fact spouted bullshit. comment deserve debate. thought nice too. Unfortunately short time March early April. empty quiet, absolutely wonderful. meantime everything like used anyway, constant noise, car hell crowds people everywhere. I'd say so. hardly get people wear mask, let alone reduce portion sizes mix diet healthier shade last line. ""That's love best Americans, consistency."" Nah, go jail far know. That’s means. lacking testing capacity test severe symptoms another tactic used terrorists ruin American way life. I’d far concerned government *didnt* prepare second wave personally “T cell immunity probably offers enough protection prevent fatal second cases” camp. concede prevalence antibodies high enough hard hit areas herd immunity viable, however. love even merest whiff civic discussion removed Q bullshit? Let's leave up, woo

good job mods Donald Glover Anna Kendrick anonymously use Reddit, Arnold Schwarznegger also comes time time post photos replies comments. &lt;1% president claims may right know... info already known Covid-19 spread air? shocking would think there's high likelihood governor lift order?  two weeks, hell break loose. US needs expand 6 foot separation requirement 2 meters like rest world. 

That extra 6 3/4” might save life. outright said kids fine bounce back. That's grossly inaccurate. I'm saying worth risk health, statement grossly inaccurate long term education effects kids remainder lives (this coming teacher) agree, think reason Trudeau meeting Trump feel Trump win reelection. Whether Trudeau confidence Trump, difficult, must meet best represent Canada's interests, unless feels Trump office November. think writing wall Trump. tell truth. failed that.  people talking coronavirus epidemic past tense see.

I want :-( interesting article, thank posing it.  even passed animal trials? remember SARS vaccines ever passing stage. overall USA decent amount mask wearing.

Reportedly wearing... amount ""under nose"" ""on chin"" masks I've seen... mean apparently living different world view sense reality... Sweden brink collapse. seem getting part way now. Damn, someone woke snarky today would think countries smart yet evil leaders would better days, like Putin Xi. Oh, wait... "" FRREDOM "" South COVID resurgence... outbreak first erupted China, necessarily mean originated China, research required.""

I agree erupted there. originated state publicly scientist. know he's Trump administration he's straight shooter since beginning. IMHO one told like regular basis, uses lot data back claims.

That said actual ratio testing cases unknown. says 12 1, NYC antibody results say 10 1, gut says 6-8 1 currently 10 1 historically. massive swag.

I actually think point virus January valid probably two months. We're probably going partial herd immunity Q1 2021, we'll probably 30-60 million doses vaccine deployed March 2021. says January, that's probably optimistic vaccine front.

Not sure follow Twitter feed references lot good data don;t see much political slant, I'm hyper sensitive political slants.

Mathematically, first wave second wave. hit national inflection point cases hospitalizations, bottoming right see deaths rise day now. inflection point mean saw peak (cases, hospitalizations deaths increased decreased) saw bottom (cases, hospitalizations, deaths decreased increased). understand came close zero cases see waves graph. might never leave second wave might get third wave schools return fourth wave around Thanskgiving.

That said end game least 150 million cases US 500,000 - million dead. couple million hospitalized. madness. Holy shit... 5’9, 250 lbs!?

That’s lot weight carry body frame size. Lots work heart too.

Glad made okay! 

Bodybuilding known hard body even non pandemic times. work schools, older, like many coworkers. campus planning bring back thousands students fall. share elevators, restrooms, office spaces. way socially distance, protections cloth masks. Administrators requiring students. We're looking jobs. Yeah. Apple Watch set face biggest date display, otherwise wouldn’t know day is. message ""we live it"" actually handled better we'd recovering Aerosols readily penetrate surgical masks, let alone ad hoc ones worn many. need N95 (properly fitted &amp; worn according safe practices) protect aerosols. Ok, calm Fat Fuckin Lenny. need rude people imagined head. “It almost bad taking direction Angels Demons.” summer holidays Sweden now... Covid can't stop that... Holy shit makes sense. father law works hospital. local government promised take extensive care anything related COVID-19 diagnosis. insignificant number infections first, fatalities, seemed fake. 
Father in-law told still 7 8 patients special ward, heavy supervision. folks since February. Oldest guy 90’s rest younger 50 one twenties. couldn’t comprehend they’d still hospital, guess really concerned long term ailments. virus, diseases insidious wish people wherewithal take serious US needs leader read, process facts, make decisions American people wallet dirt foreign power holds him. situation change trump removed power. Oh sure! I'm coming standpoint somebody position decision-making power, decisions merit studies pre-print would something I'd take part in; seeing I'm dude relevant experience/training, saw way benefit view info feel confident knowing merits of.

Of course there's going debate group think potential governing body effect legitimacy peer review, also going discussions head well, keep circling back around ""peer review somebody position still beneficial standpoint consume info from."" Case fatality rate consistently going down, 6% 2 months ago... hello op, checked tsla stock price today?  here, company located young Dundas Square looking structure many us maybe working home full time going forward Except good guys, bad guys. 

How controversial? fucking NAZIS husbands heaven. Im hell Went Amherst College hadn’t heard this. hopeful cell mechanisms camp well. body amazing variety back ups. Let's hope works... confers long lasting immunity (i.e. least one year). Where's USNS Mercy nowadays? still New York? Might time start moving it. enjoy quarantine much kissed another woman months... think experts divided this. air inside plane's cabin changed every couple minutes, many scientists conclude safe, others stress lack distancing makes hard safe. Something note know. symptoms potentially EVERYDAY occurrence us suffering fibromyalgia. daughter way least half time. surprised disease leaves many fibro suffers wake. Sweden, went back January told several weeks row they'd top rolling 7 day average per capita death rate WORLD

I went back substituted real Swedish stats turns Sweden actually number one Good luck making friends' life miserable! Mom's caregiver years. wanted Dad. health finally declined rapidly, made sure comfortable nothing more. Also, plan can’t develop lasting immunity virus?

Testing treatment. Basically. lack affordable options, education, stigmatization help all.

Social media also plays huge part people agree cognitive biases misinformation add fuel fire. 

We're doomed nation. 2 meters mean anything many Americans. ADA requires *reasonable accommodation* business disability. persons two required wear mask face covering public. cannot allow people crowded, indoor spaces. business allow entry. Curbside pickup, drive thru delivery options. There's requirement let people sans mask.

Autism, sensory disorders, panic disorders... optioks ADA magic open seasame businesses. Let's real Texas currently ""unsustainable"" surge capacity original chart b4 changed it. overrun. They've adding ghost beds (beds w/o staffing) claim capacity - Arizona. None previous election contenders ever advocated new system. did, last till final round anyway political donations would suddenly dry up. Lol there’s plenty work world. shortage catastrophic disasters 2020 warned “the public, even scientists, lose full confidence without clearer technical guidance.” quintessential euthanasia question though: could stick around forever, never things find enjoyable, would hell.

So people get Alzheimer's might want stick around suffer effects, recourse.

Someone feels like already can't things used enjoy, feel like muh time left anyway, might care much whether die COVID19 (or flu, getting hit car, or...)

Not saying that's case dad, that's poster asking.

Also, recommend covid way go elderly. likely suck maybe even make last years life miserable. absurdly difficult staying hopeful long term positive change. U.S.? Unified? Happen. ^^^^ yup!! I’m totally convinced Trump acts like it’s big deal told America get back work, it’s hoax it’ll go away soon blah blah blah. 
Cause briefed months ago killing minorities alarming rate probably shrugged shoulders like fuck care then?? 
People don’t take serious it’s serious take!! Getting back normal fast country maybe epic fail modern history!! cases soaring. back starting point. Death rates rise soon hospitals pushed max capacity still acting like business usual country. Really sad see country right now. laughing stock world. Might well be...  people area like “I can’t stand liberal politics anymore, I’m moving AZ!” generally quite happy. Lol. place basically retirement home enraged boomers, would make sense looking infection rates. You’re definitely right. Didn’t say something beginning akin “go outside go parks” etc etc? understand program ask asked feel comfortable ask. sign consent forms. Also, much asked usually already news. Maybe look parents maybe parents exploited child television show. throwing out. Shes news anchor job ask questions, even sensitive ones. unsensitive times like said parents sign consent shows discuss asked , also brings awareness. It’s that. Since spike test turnaround time skyrocketed. shortage tests, take someone 9 days get result. know, unless person proactive self quarantines that’s 9 days potential spread Social distancing? use masks Denmark, numbers fine issue is, Americans, little hope. can’t get people wear mask, certainly can’t get anything else. don’t even stay home active symptoms! 

We can’t contact trace cases even accurately report. (I live Florida!)

We’re polite personal space. Never be. 

As much smart mask-wearing people don’t want admit it... masks “gotcha”. It’s benefits mask, it’s sign person cares health community and, likely, good hygiene/takes precautions elsewhere. 

Some country turned symbol political party it’s symbol one’s empathy/hygiene/alertness. 

It also reminder hell going right now, someone lives absolute thick right now... see 90% people around need damn reminder. 

Masks save lives FL. welcome FAR thought attack aren’t getting likely won’t due impacts economy. it’s 40% better nothing. consider government guideline start need stay home work felt symptoms obvious workplaces including nursing homes vulnerable outset asymptomatic carriers. 

The way nursing homes could truly protect residents isolate staff patients entirely outbreak, far know government asked nursing home sector. 

Instead countries effected lockdown community reduced community infection reason Sweden still countries travel ban list. inaccurate makes blood boil. makes sound like culprit flaw balance power political divisions, inept response specific people charge. Im oxygen im leaving damn house I'm grateful moved place yard less year quarantine started. Canada learn, far late, lessons identified article. pretty good job damping community transmission, long term care/senior residences accounted 75-80% Covid-19 deaths... among worst, worst track record industrialized countries date. Provinces (the responsible level government) have, variously, cancelled business licenses, taken home management, dictated staffing policies (e.g. staff movement among homes), enhanced PPE availability, changed accommodation requirements, disallowed visitors, gone massive training/hiring schemes, increased pay personal support workers, filled staff gaps using army personnel, etc. public recognition stop gap measures. fixes pursued entail serious problems social wellbeing residents, especially dementia. Short term plans next months, needed, take place total overhaul (along radical increase government spending) necessary. hope American states learn screwups actions proven helpful. Rush reopen directed Commander Cheif. agree, cases likely increase. However, 250 deaths single day, FAR think it’s important find spots brightness difficult time.  virus airborne, social distancing indoors much honesty. Even implemented exactly be, flow people essentially creating turbulence plume viral matter spreads remaining suspended confined areas.

The solution see implement ventilation systems vent indoor air outside high rate continually.

I would offer information free, nobody would accept requires cost implement. US economy crashes burns maybe people take things consideration. It’s really mayors fault. Ducey muzzled local governments refused let make rules. Literally day Ducey reversed almost AZ mask laws article references Barcelona sewerage study. think wrong. would impossible dates following March 12, 2018 would show increasing volumes Sars-CoV2, not. believe virus start spreading Wuhan world time, October 28, 2019. `South SE Asia` though. 14 days what? I'm sure understand question. Could rephrase me? people need look science. looking science, best interest student, teacher family health resume person classes normal. say districts around us stated something basic essential masks optional.

The study break data worst impacted province 14.4% April NY well shutdown peaking, shutdowns know southern states fair.

I'm afraid never get things control unless states take unified approach. unfortunately people going Florida area back March-May, Florida lockdown I'm sure flock places vacation/go beach spread issue.

To think could sort ""normalcy"" everyone else saw issues NE months back react accordingly distancing protective measures. selfish nation something collective whole, even sacrificing something together. fuckers crucified I've talked lot people shifting anti vaccination group. People consider reasonable, rational people. 

If true large percentage refuse take vaccine available... could long scary ride humanity Thw WHO's guidance covid trapped large droplets fell ground leaving infected human. 1.5 2 meters social distance recommendation, way spit. But, transmissions occurring, people contracting across room, assumption be, covid hangs air microdroplets, pushed across space yelling singing. Thus making safety standards much rigorous.

I, probably lot others read ""there evidence of"" ""x false investigation.""

Good learn something new though. I'll read differently next time. you’re going Harvard community college radar keep shifting focus depending narrative want tell. average, across whole state, still open beds, Texas huge! sone cities regions hit capacity weeks ago list growing- RGV region capped out, Houston several hospitals capped out, on. sounds like would make good Randy episode.

Economics employable degree, especially also skills data analytics like OP.

And 3.4 good GPA economics major.

OP, places hiring freeze right now. Keep networks, especially internships professors you’re close to. somebody teach Trump use Zoom already? Oh didnt know US society runs honor system, laws recommendations.

After law enforcement control people force, especially repressive countries cops armed better troops ""not sorry"" part know horrible insult People actually listen government Canada, yes, responsible average. sounds logical. Yeah, somehow forgot H7N9. right that's nightmare fuel flu. Ok see that, however herd immunity route certainly isn’t unachievable current lowered death rate, it’s gonna suck vulnerable however it’s approach US take, it’s least damaging way overall current situation. SCBA better? certainly examples believe factor, IMHO far between.

And worth noting example referring still people sitting room. said: ""From examination potential routes transmission, concluded likely cause outbreak droplet transmission.""  Haha well said! left says we're racists... kids, ages 5 7, thrived it. They're playing well together, older one (my introvert) exhausted grouchy time, nothing evenings spend quality time together.

I'm introvert mind much. uncertainty future that's got down. happen next would white house invite racist? Multiple studies starting show antibodies might last little 2 months. Virus new anyone say sure herd immunity. That's I'm saying, change names. ""right"" bad past, call ""left"" now, same. problem authoritarism. world gullible changing name opposite we'd get thing actually. 
Just look Germany, 15 years leader, call developed democracy world. People gullible. None yet didn’t know covid followed story I’m praying peace passed on. It’s horrifying many people suffering lot don’t support. I’m thinking family. risk well risk transmitting others. way! 2021 maybe. sheer man power get BILLIONS doses take months assuming passes Phase 3 final testing also take months. sometimes doctors mess send elective surgery patients ICU (or morgue), tune quarter million people per year, they're trying best continued seen heroes.

Would hate trump associated racially insensitive folks. Seriously, [same restaurant sold sandwiches made horses worked death left fell. put frequent dish fresh-slaughtered, quick-frozen horse else? Googling yielding great results me. Thanks advance :) again, pure bullshit. Yesterday post all. day three posts.

You're inventing conspiracy theory easily disproved. Covid: Nice appetizer. ready main course. hair closed eyes? head state

Queen Lizzy actually head state. I'm kind horrified number people attitudes boiling ""lol, coming"". Maybe want express that, think truly wishing clarify: think governor would coming got sick? *hope* people mean apply everyone state.

You see people who've staying home months end now. People behaving responsibly invisible. ""I'm home behaving sensibly"" make news. mean exist important.

I'm sorry. I'd frustrated situation shoes, must suck come see people apparently applauding risk live in. Gun head, forced guess: think chances flight costs coming November 2020? 

I'm US citizen living Thailand. want fly back BKK Atlanta eventually. right away, lot timing depends cost ticket home. current thoughts costs likely come November. Cant try pickle nose first? Please. Trump fucking idiot. died yet? keep seeing word ""individualism"" lot statements. I'd argue nothing it. think cultural. tribal small tribes. seeing numbers hard get control places lots space. Take southern united states. Beaches bad. What's bad people go beach groups 10-20 members group. One member it, get it. backyard BBQs, parties, bars, etc... We're insanely social. easier lock dense city prevent kind gathering. going prevent Alabama, especially holidays like memorial day 4th July. People crowd onto personal boats, cars, etc... 

People keep blaming politics. would make sense people agreed president getting sick. aren't, lot older less social people. However, black community Alabama highest percentage group carriers. social. keep like stodgy old white people. president's fault, would entire race people part like him, risk? note- said Phoenix place people sent Tucson discussions health care providers Tucson, shipping people San Diego Albuquerque, New Mexico,"" Spurbeck said."" lucky shipped Phoenix.""

And hospital state Arizona reports State Surge Line **every four hours**. hospitals share many staffed ICU beds availale time. number availbale beds change every four hours variety reasons. slang already slang ""full throttle"" , in, resumed full throttle (maximum acceleration) know many right thing, always dumbest yell loudest. shame. It’s NY def. mandate. handled. Thanks. calls dad's dong? think Canadians part conscientious collectivist Americans whole. I've lived many expat communities spent lot time USA larger *subsection* people care bucking rules self serving Canada. Personally day day life would say use cloth masks. Sure effective still get close viral load breathing air someone pass by. N95s ability seal begins degrade wear eventually becomes effective lower quality masks, addition N95s fully effective unless know fit face correctly (yes specific protocol putting on, especially dealing viral situations).

As far respirator valve, mask designed close try close it. Also Trudeau's wife recently recovered COVID-19. Calling obvious troll account brigading? whatttttt????are kidding right?????right ?????? Thanks pointing mistake. Sorry I’m great statistics. lot people asymptomatic well probably never get tested never symptoms. would mean death rate likely lot less? ANTFA is!

Thank you! Depending whether NM willing take probably Albuquerque Yes all! Plus idk I'm saving much money! gas toll alone used like $80/week plus going &amp; eating home, trips mall (my mom sis I) I've even able start diet plan actually stick it. great regard course period laid idea great thankfully recovery well savings helped stay afloat. I'm lucky thankful appreciative get work home time foreseeable future. live USA much hope getting unscathed I'm happy stay in. Also feel like mix extrovert introvert (idk that's thing) introvert side happy extrovert also like ""yea ok use break"" lol Reading comprehension must difficult you.

I'm talking wearing mask personal choice.

When would stop crying **ordered** wear one. i.e. choice.

50% fatality rate? 80% fatality rate? 99% fatality rate?  Ok well guessing... uninformed. add other's replied, think latest report 100m doses end year. 

There 330m people US i'd assume doses strictly go us time, means likely VIPs, health care workers, Government types get end year (if hold time line) average joe see till sometime next year. probably aren’t. assume finite resources.. social media groups pick time-being? Obviously going full experience meeting random people campus could something useful future semesters everyone back. Wow

What day life someone delusional really look like sometimes wonder Depending are, fair game collect packages immediately upon finding them. places require report good go. fact, even owner package around Tom Hanks salvaged them, would entitled reward equal value salvaged cargo. maritime law salvage.

Edit: may poignant note applies maritime salvage, land. well laws vary slightly depending international waters close land (for instance, coast Florida wanted salvage ""abandoned cargo"" even abandoned vessel, would call law enforcement report it, could go ahead savage. Florida, would obey U.S. maritime laws, least while).  seeing what’s happening south. states like Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, yet significant sustained increase COVID deaths. data support conclusion. worry endless barrage doomsday headlines subreddit turned others away hard data toward frivolous speculation. I'm also guessing real death rates covered certain states. [Excess pneumonia deaths jump Maybe ""jack trades"" cop partnershp police case things get control. know...we need get point force first thing comes play every situation states manage it? Look many jobs events support (older, coronaviruses) Obligatory SJW policing people's thoughts ideas. poke fun things. one laughing people like you. making staff faculty work campus. ridiculous. Fuck relate. ex said faking “enjoy victim.” Sure enjoy able work loved, even walk around without ... well, like said. Coughing fits. Fuck people Exactly prudent, sensible science backed policies this. really think reason, bars restaurants first gett hit, offices large number people working job can't done home, ect sake analysis, assuming mask requested accommodation. course others exist, requires separate analysis. could businesses accommodation possible, example plasma donation center likely accommodation. crave civic discussion whilst time completely shutting alternative brand conversation?

How someone crave civic discussion also shutting alternative civic discussion? dunno maybe also crave internal consistency. That’s bad. know prepared hospitals lockdown. humidity, ugh. remember leaving work dark like 6am glasses instantly fogging soon stepped outside. oppressively nasty. yet Florida .... Someday! Yup. win 👌🏻 millennials killed Applebees yet? Zoom American company based San Jose, CA. sure Chinese government Zoom. I'm saying factor three week lag meaning compare today's deaths cases 3 weeks prior. graph out, still goes down. Obviously different hospitals get stressed know couple weeks what's happening point still stands. give end week. damage already done. can't wave magic wand fix people already contracted virus brink showing symptoms. generations something bad happen them.

Some generation face global war, past pandemics. Others went global depression.

I think anyone really gets free ride. Shit always happens. Gen X. escape war South East Asia, still stuck cold war way 90's. dot com collapse screwing entire industries. war terror. America fucked us global financial crisis.

I went epicentre SARS, several diseases. I'm living pandemic well.

I mean, nobody getting life unscarred. Welcome club.

I think problem Z expected easy. sure showed him! Damn. Melania really looking forward visit too. Good thing antibodies end immune system. really great immune system rely one defense mechanism. Everyone noticed. Everyone knows means. It’s unique US though states particularly low ratio confirmed cases vs likely covid. mean, even much simplification, honestly. There's never much actual thought logic behind Albertan separatism. Knowing hospital workers, personally. care lot people would struggle leaving thousands die. 

Something else needs done. Wut one saying not. price still expected none perks. Oh, sweet. love good coin flip. pm colored entire body black multiple occasions Lol arent already producing them? meet via Zoom. hopefully Trump turns Potato filter. I'm high risk group, odds surviving without permanent damage would small. I'll phone doctor day becomes available. conjunction food deserts, junk food easier cheaper consume Here's earlier story; I've seen later ones death rate said 4 percent March. terrifying rightly so. death rate 0.25 so. Thank God. It’s near bad feared. Still taken seriously every single death tragedy thankful wasn’t 4 percent population. never developed antibodies all. man likely.

It's also somewhat simple way making numbers look better are. cases increase week week percentage increases decrease, even numbers going up, comparing ever growing number total cases.

It also make sense compare one days numbers seven day average. it’s common sense, sounds like angry local national health leaders anything even though it’s common sense, rather WHO. Ah yes! film industry essential service. makes Hollywood stars different us? Absolutely fucking nothing. British twat waffle government 🙄🙄 (and yes I'm British say this). I'm sure heart attack symptoms well minor one. That's incorrect. 

In fact, furthest-along vaccine SARS ended actually giving people SARS killing people, stopped reason. Same. got bad April never developed antibodies. thing fucked. I’m going get time likely kill me. put money economy too. 40%? 100%? -high expectations asian father That’s true all, especially business government. Again, source claim Econ majors high unemployment rates? think starts reframing everything down~~ Pandemics disproportionately hurt poorest members society

Grocery workers going facing exponentially dangerous conditions unmitigated pandemkc progresses. Servers going getting reduced hours crap paychecks people stop coming in. Fixed-income elderly able pay luxury staying inside like wealthy peers delivery groceries necessities.

You say today first day history.

I hearing past 2 months. Still waiting SURGE deaths, get lowest deaths months. I’m boat. Live MN, cases low starting tick back little bit, unfortunately. Lockdown ended month ago I’m tad nervous it’s going get bad August. Check recent vaccine news, pretty good. Remember sub also extremely negatively biased. Takes long time manufacture distribute millions. 6 months now, sub useless throwaways screeching wrong sub single person cares opinions. Wow, September soon...my friend wedding May got postponed November. still fence going November seems way soon especially looking daily cases US time high. supposed Hawaii, Hawaii there's lot less coronavirus, reception lot people mainland worries me. remember downvoted saying this. agree, parents shitty. PRAY RECOVERY! forget ur mom! r/girlsmirin shit yes would. Wtf talking about. someone dies young, people want know much possible. clearly weird narrative head projecting people. said say again. friends opinion vs people live country. Yeah... Noone listening anymore. realize that? Oh yes forgot Alberto dislike natives thanks Small government silly myth needs die. [The party Ayn Rand Rand Paul] ideology evangelical fash hand power corporate overlords guided invisible forces like hands market pray people corporations properly even though there's nothing make so, since oafs believe consumer protection insurance on. Damn, many people died San Antonio??

#EDIT: looked, looks like county 14,500 laboratory confirmed cases 130 deaths. bad actually 🙂 ask what's point shutting down. original plan stop spread slow give hospitals time prepare. However, people openly flaunted defiance rules assumed slow spread longer threat. Shutting become necessity areas idiots forcing healthcare system become overwhelmed they've jacked rate transmission. hand people followed simple guidelines like wearing mask going need, we'd see transmission rates drop businesses would able stay open. 

Simply put, idiots ruined best plans forcing local closures cases soar. could allowed local areas stay open simple fixes. someone upthread linked something showing general, 50%-50% phase 3. Trump holding bottle maple syrup standing White House steps...”hard pass” says Trudeau. Probably. Wheelchairs, like service animals, may special status law, answer “yes, need accommodate them.” It’s pretty rare, example, completely cuff, business could make area safe wheelchairs matter would need install ramps. Consider scenic area requires unsafe crossing cliff reach, ramp would required (subject caveat wheelchairs may special status would affect analysis). idea pathogenic mutation csnk2a1 would affect outcome exposed COVID? posted article Oregon subreddit got bunch people arguing numbers saying less 10,000 based assumptions people recovered now, opinions absolutely useful definitely digestible googling state's info. punishment?🤔

Seems like 97% stuff like happening lot jails prisons unusal anymore. I’d stealing kinds shit and/or vandalizing it. I'm putting money oxford one. idea French Bayonne reason people say ""If smells like Bayonne, leave alone"" Bayonne, NJ. self-glorification...

I fortunate boys born 36 weeks quite late triplets smallest 3lbs 10oz good weight - still stay NICU weeks. 

It’s scary stuff even there’s pandemic going on! Bull. **We already vaccines tested work!**

End discussion. issue making sure vaccines cause extreme side effects least side effects manageable. Nowhere near many, much regulated. know wont purchasing milk doesnt 'canada milk' logo it. he? post positive articles balance negative articles?

But no, last time submitted post ten months ago.

You complain people's posts, make own. posts positive articles complain represented here? Why? Looks like Ivanka gonna think another way “annual retreat” away Jared 😏 correct illegal use growth hormones Canadian livestock. Also, Canadian milk lower threshold white blood cell counts acceptable. Mexico's total population double Spain's. Also Mexico get took time characteristics nation different. 

Don't get wrong, every single death regrettable, think comparing countries like like comparing apples oranges. ""fair"" compare ""per million"" data. even water bottle sad think damaging behavior acceptable going long time. Failure...the new American way. people beach, police enforcing. fined like seatbelt. obvious implication people trained specifically purpose - they're going start forcing office psychiatrists street triage. Lol. Considering know conduct decency manners public forum without feeling urge utter threats publicly loudly world figures doubts ever ever issue contend with. electorial college system developed make sure state fair representation voting office president.

However time needed. needed anymore, use Gerrymandering turn form voter suppression. outdated needs go. insane me, especially many presymptomatic transmissions. real twist would electoral college breaking convention voting someone vote for.... 'ye 2020

Today's Supreme Court ruling made harder, lol. sure. Pretty sure international waters happened. Science truth. scientist say science = truth. Run anyone claims 'tell truth.'

Science experimenting. experiment replicated, theory formed. reformed updated verified data comes in. point becomes treated truth, never truth. physics, comes quantum physics basically polar opposite physics many ways... time.

If wearing mask outdoors, virtue signaling. exception would close someone else talking, laughing, coughing, sneezing. Then, course, mask minimize risk. study shows wearing mask outdoors minimizes risks others unless already stated. First available October 300 million January 2021 Even Kim Jong Un knows diplomatic meetings improve polling numbers *seen.* Counterpoint, see private medical information anyone. there's already system place that's *supposed* take care situation. VP cabinet remove president major health issues.

Why beyond me, technically already covered.

Like, imagine situation right conclusive medical records prove president coma made public. way get vp methods already place require public knowledge personal health.  Right, thoughts South Korea fact population density 5 times US?

You know, place 250 cases per million people, contrast 9000 cases per million people US? good. Ive seen lot people wearing masks go groceries essentials. saw people wearing masks Orillia (pop 20k) grocery store NoFrills city weekend though locals say citiots. That’s really stupid. bet see outbreak here. really hope though. 

If ever over, we’ve gotta start teaching kids school take medical professionals seriously. country another 10% scientific literacy, maybe would better fighting pandemic. AstraZeneca put tons money producing vaccine might even pan out. They've incurred big costs saying something generate profit even int best-case scenario?

If big potential profit end works out, shareholders sue hell company. Yep, everyone prop trump use toward goals. Closed borders Europe earlier sure. Brazil. makes zero sense waited May that’s response been. Always one step behind. “Hey boos, still guy! See ya few.” Peace, order good government. That's Canada you. Um get positive test results back? blown away average person's response crisis. sobering.

Wrong.

**Conclusions: conclusion, [...] lung affected asymptomatic asymptomatic positive. I’m downplaying virus you’re healthy individual isn’t dangerous. 

You said yourself, **we long term studies** and, guy said, **this multi-organ attacking disease,** family infectious diseases [alarming mental problems chronic fatigue found 40% survivors years Further, mutation already showing potential leave lung scarring, kidney damage, etc., even mild asymptomatic cases.

So asymptomatic positive feel fine. I'm really happy short-term complications. less suffering COVID causes, better. way ""data"" suggests disease ""dangerous"" fit guy, even *completely* clear, thing consider ""dangerous"" death itself. simply **do data** determine long-term effects be, data indicates might much peachy carefree time people like want believe. 

Anyway, bottom line thinking deeply whatsoever. either get point now, incapable critical thought choosing believe whatever narrative conveniently suits life choices.

It's mistake think testing answer here. country able test much 1/500 population daily. new daily infections get anywhere close number, going find all.

Also, back topic, Arizona load distribution plan hospitals moving patients around wherever space normal. means going exceed hospital capacity locally, one day single bed left state.

Oh are. sick we'd many, many pandemics without them.  EU reporting similar disinformation attacks: Initially yes.

Rent mortgage payments frozen. Property tax land adjusted apply 3 months. Stay home, get free money watch Youtube."" Instead, tried half-assed lockdown financial support large percentage population. course people going rebel abandoned lied to.

And 90% died / Covid 65.

Even though amount daily new cases low since then, amount active cases still rising. people still infected tested positive 3 months ago? That's pretty obvious watch show. keeps directing dialogue back her. Pretty much ""let's talk me"" really think entertainment industry employs anyone?

You talking circles. Read headline: universities saying back campus enrollment still down. Can’t blame see saying, grew AZ still flu season come go exact time everyone else. coronavirus seasonal flu, would expect see follow patterns. No, think going stop them. growth hormones Canadian milk. trucks used carry milk products Canada carry milk; American milk carried whatever truck available.

I stick Canadian milk. Well, [here’s one late Like we'll actually able rid Trump 2024. Buckle up. ""But that's Germany. euro stuff work America.""

*sigh* Let's go far. Murder 1 criminals get fucked care die... 🎶Bum bada bum bum Good night sweet heart well time go🎶 Nah Congressmen/women children first. month vaccinating highest bidders makes way doctors &amp; nurses.. /s White House infested COVID think good idea invite neighbor tea. Uh, what?  want guy, Trudeau's head state Canada.. That's good working theory! Thanks discussion Trump germaphobe one even isolated incident either. black brown face many times he’d forgotten amount LOL Meanwhile Florida rare sight see anyone mask on. 4th July fireworks night loaded people beaches single group people went masks on. Terrible. Expect cases continue rise Florida. :/  don’t know. Usually backdate I’m never sure shitshow like wet.. sounds counterintuitive, actual dynamics viral spread probably much statistical game medical one. run mill nurse going well versed medical aspect PPE rightly recognize people wearing non-N95 masks going even come close assuring get infected. nurse painfully aware simple surgical mask unlikely save COVID patient coughing face. disconnect course viral spread nothing game - mitigation viral spread eliminating many vectors possible suppressing number new infections infected break exponential growth taking place. Masks kind like vaccine face (or guess vaccine people around you, since masks helpful keeping germs keeping out), statistical standpoint. They're 100% effective much less effective whole population participate, even adopted bit majority population, collective benefit eliminating *some* new infections helpful suppressing spread among population whole talking something grows exponentially absence said mitigation effort. Hospitalization, ICU admissions daily deaths steadily decreasing two months 

And? Considering result herd immunity, vaccine, seems suggest treatments COVID-19 become much better. shows ""front loading"" deaths killed many people unnecessarily.

But let's forget ICU admissions controlled criteria used prioritise access beds - many people simply denied treatment ICU. ICU numbers meaningless.

One question... I'm sure want share good news... get data hospitalisation? FHM data contains ICU admissions. another source find hospitalisation data? im far Chicago. save spot know words.. best words. Believe not, summer camps state open (both day overnight camps). big surprise city run day camp open 5 days close 14 days kids exposed someone wit lab confirmed case. Pfft. Next going tell government going mandate cloth genital coverings.

Pure tyranny. /S made zero excuses life. actual fuck talking about? Please, get head checked. Melania Ivanka going devastated! didn’t say right medical records. right know whether incapacitated incapable leading, check ensure 25th Amendment appropriately followed carried out. It’s clear procedures followed many times last century kind oversight needed. already working surge capacity... staff really go much higher. They'll need bring nurses/doctors states like NY peak.

But states time around Biden good margin Bernie. 

So hope rust belt swing left knows weight 

Civility. You’ll get comments removed. hoping Andres Manuel catches virus trip he’ll stop destroying country everywhere. You’re right, [here’s one late want compare Mexico Spain, took Mexico way longer get number deaths Spain has, Spain strict lockdown Mexican don’t see possible Mexico, take account Mexico 2x population means per capita less half deaths Spain does. also fire start lockdown going cottage...so least learnt watch YouTube channel mean ""beats Covid-19""? virus dangerous age group. countermeasures fears serve purpose protect elderly overburden health care system huh? go go lock down. Part Trump's 2016 campaign saying Obama cost US standing international community tough enough. Well, roughly four years later become joke rest world.

I’m surprised hasn’t account locked. Reddit takes political threats kinda seriously. Theres another explanation treatments could better doctors time study works best. (That's true)

It's also possible highest risk people finally staying home amd proper measures lower risk people making infections.

Wait! No... Please no... Trump say plan along. lost weight due food similar every day, types food like eat disappeared stores, good seems. Maybe factories got closed demand causes never reach stores area. Americans like listening doctors scientists either, apparently. think I'll plan mask burning bonfire too! That's comparable, would go indoors people knowing catch / spread deadly virus? Maybe stop saying name go away. Like coronavirus. hospitalizing lot people asymptomatic

No, this. tell quarantine away everyone two weeks. know family another state this. MERS still there. much much harder transmit. mostly confined camels. mow 2 acre land via push. functional enough go shopping alone drive Target functioning adult, handle wearing mask short periods time. high fun son autism understand needs wear mask wear it. low func autistic people may understand able wear mask. Guess happens 80% population wearing masks? R0 drops. happens 50% practice good social distancing? R0 drops. Etc, theory current level compliance US


What argument herd immunity, argument places like Michigan New York executed successful public health measures drive infection rate down.  '*I never thought leopards* would eat face,' sobs woman voted Leopards Eating People's Faces Party one way similar: blaming communities hit hardest virus lack morals.

Americans Covid-19 gays AIDS. Probably group. Reminds Clockwork Orange. Case fatality rate 4.4%. steadily (if slowly) declining almost three months now, marginal (daily) rate mid 1's, weekdays low 1's. Yeah, incoming president one recommend judges, right? one still significant time left?

Let's face it, politics showmanship. people care getting job done hamstrung people collecting paycheck. know, I'm facetious. frustrates hell always post-weekend lull without fail media today like ""hurr durr number go down"". that's found issue.

You want welfare state vote one don’t misconstrue founding documents requiring one. seriously generalising whole people ""trash"" based experiences them? Like actually read right? I’ve seeing warning texas hospitals overrun covid patients within one two weeks longer two weeks. hope recent projection also incorrect. electing who? really trying compare Trump Trudeau right now?

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. came China that’s another virus come China. didn’t come China, ton questions need answered hell found waste water Europe December(?) think effective part banning events/large crowds closed rooms/halls one two infected persons could infect many know what, that’s really good point. punk rocker mindset Americans isn’t one lead low compliance rates.

France Germany marginally better now, (in case France, especially) later widespread-adoption US

I'm getting data here, way: may, quantifying require significant research. everything point, safest thing continue abide precautions. Wear mask outside home. it’s N95, great. not, still wear it.

Is evidence death rate actually lower? seeing large spikes cases past weeks, deaths tend lag positive cases month so. Asking world leader punched face political violence, I’m sure banned. curious. really interesting see following (as example) plays out: Bob works SF. wants stay current job, work remotely Helena, MT.

Rush reopen + people following reopening rules.

But, sadly, science-denying, deep-state-conspiracy, rights first, 'murica. Trudeau....you're great. compared guy we've got. Good move, smart man. district live isnt even limiting school bus capacity! passed peer review published Lancet. Yes, pretty awful. Spain excess mortality numbers 50% higher tested deaths, even worse. 

Note, though, nursing homes probably infected far 5%. 1.76% implied IFR mortality population infected, full population. everywhere. people waiting day long cars texas Many successful countries actually went work well USA

Here put country compare mobility data curves. USA much line western world average depth duration shutdown.

Danish kids back school mid April example. back office 100 percent well month, today first day office started working 100 convincing everyone necessary. get people choose comply instead mandating threat force Nazi daily case count increase definitely wrong, 11xx moving 83xx definitely 580%

the hospitalization number appears right, case peak graph hospitalization peak graph month apart, i'd say hospitalization rate keep climbing least long

daily deaths lag even states, florida tricky since pnuemonia death rate year much higher average hard tell ones covid related ones aren't, i'd willing bet death lag week two hospital lag support majority, obviously minority vocal. point meeting get side. know that's possible Canada, mostly want stay radar get cranky border closed much better numbers are.

Good move Trudeau. staying subreddit now.

It isn’t black white. Smart move, Canada... clue, look number people hospital, 100% affected OK, die it’s spreading California doesn’t mean it’s spreading New York.

Once get virus control, biggest concern people traveling territory.

If aggressive contact tracing control it.

New York shut hard. Got virus control. reopening slowly.

The places virus rampant need shut fuck yesterday.

You stop spread. Control virus. Test outbreaks. trying get world leaders killed via Corona there? exactly fuck even politicians Canada nice?  
does Canada holds absolute monopoly niceness? think it’s naive put testing solution. It’s abundantly clear US far enough 1. Make testing priority 2. Quarantine effectively. doesn’t matter tons testing available people refuse right thing stay home positive around someone tested postivie would suspect consistently moderately low compliance across board worse inconsistent compliance, compliance great areas poor others. someone done study 1/4 people covering nose.

Why hell would someone relatively wealthy (he estimated multi millionaire) family insurance? would need $400k medical bills?

Just someone asks money mean true. really strange. sad mean ask questions.

Yet see Reddit's response long sob story hand money multi millionaire attack anyone asks questions need it. No. 

The issue actual data used determine spread protests.

Contact tracers New York told ask, Minneapolis asked 4 testing stations, protests. 

Even asking useful helping predict future cases, current infections way know virus contracted. broke quarantine way track trace. entering window could build dataset virus spread protests, everyone asked, everyone tested, andnonly everyone honest st protest.

That problem virus infect spread asymptomatically and/or produce minor symptoms. Nope. people like Trump insisting COVID liberal hoax put people rabbit hole led “masks don’t work” bad actors deliberately misconstrued expert opinion masks part ongoing campaign undermine discredit experts. * fed doesnt take tax money, wont paying it.  Trump father sued housing discrimination. One seems worse. Nothing saying changes facts. make assumptions want money used end day directly stated gofundme money required medical bills. point newspapers since literally beginning.

You're supposed read headline, go ""what?!?"", buy copy see actual story might be. Clickbait old hills. Yea pretty much. read, husband filed divorce said mental health issues. He's one called police showed house (that previously kicked of).

Apparently also got row previous employers claiming told clients mental problems. basically, ever touch eyeballs, nose, mouth without washing hands. agreed. reason people think wearing mask allows social distance. It’s one both. Yikes, gonna ugly... lockdowns properly, perhaps? It’s censorship banned calling political violence, happen.

The applies here. Different vaccines use different types technologies. example, Oxford’s like flu vaccine, Imperial’s uses self-replicating RNA doesn’t need virus all. everyone use type vaccine. Similarly different types vaccines harder mass-produce. vaccines make 40 million doses month fit 2 million inside 1 litre bottle others need multiple months manufacture 2 million doses take space.

I see. problem though is, say adult child syndrome hard try, keep mask on. still may take public point. Like draw line? going back territory hiding disabled people away rest society. people know actually lost weight (I know - anecdotal).

I’ve lost 35 pounds since March 4 (when wife decided going anymore anything could avoid).

I don’t keep beer home, helps. don’t go work (I back working home), control schedule work almost every day (treadmill weights home). don’t even delivery take out, cooking meals.

My vodka consumption definitely increased I’m sleeping less (which seems common issue), lockdown really good except reasons it.

My wife introverts, I’m lucky job work home effectively (more effectively, honestly) house deck overlooking woods.

If worried money internet... yeah, would suck. Definitely around lot longer month mostly never made sense. 2 weeks personally see symptoms lag overwhelm hospital much longer.

But TX, FL, AZ hitting capacity now, start see effects soon.  leaves gasping air rest lives

Citation needed tools would rather kill man instead wearing mask. Insanity haven’t seen anyone argue that. argument people generally using states already starting open protests broke out. Yes protests likely contribute cases majority likely linked bats restaurants people giving fuck cause Trump downplaying it. Yeah importantly refused close schools. School staff students became ill.

It rookie mistake based public health policy. outright lying. 

There articles last weeks showed basically adding ghost beds beleive ads place looking nurses trained hospital staff ASAP (tho could Arizona.) got downvoted like me, glad could share thoughts. thought alone this.

The hardest part seeing Spaniards Italians dying someone sweden saying poor. one got hard heard swede job. don’t care Trudeau. Follow sub rules. read them. Spread spread. protests dont get justification cause. Tom Hanks abandoned = good guy. “There important things living"" -Lt. Governor Texas, Dan Patrick

We're doomed. Don’t question it. guys delusional Donald statement. Given extent spread Hubei province, think readily spread via aerosols, also ventilation, situation would lot worse... IMHO would expect lot data (from lot places beyond china) pointing spread folks following self-quarantine, spread occurred neighbors nonetheless. PURPLE FTW!! Impossible. Trump hold meetings. I'm surprised go way: Make requirement coronavirus therefore immunity. Yeah, put context... essentially making America joke statistically unbalanced criminal justice system. honest then; he's making now. Looking forward inevitable ebola parties 2030.

Company work for, Smith &amp; Nephew, made form business travel extremely restrictive need explicit approval someone quite high chain. 

Can't say I'm surprised others companies give fucks protests going month half, largest protests 3 4 weeks ago, well beyond longest incubation period COVID. Data shown places biggest spikes protest hotspots.

If watch lot footage protests, wearing masks ""sanitization stations"" people could get hand sanitizer clean up. protestors far personally-responsible anti-mask loonies trying hang governors get haircut. probably made deal devil Asymptomatic. cost Dementia. still see people eating hands driving picking face. spot on. Racial minorities poor crushed virus large platform speak this. mainly impacting wealthy Caucasian population we'd seeing different response government. 

I work wealthy region state thought back March I'd seeing wave elderly Caucasian patients affluent business people lot international travel. completely wrong. hospital getting filled covid patients poorer suburbs Hispanic patients continue working essential manual labor jobs. They'd come 2-3 family members deep time whole family contracted it. rich folks managed quarantine mansions groundskeepers died. realise even selling every dose dollar would net billions, right? They're free link Italian study? Thanks. Tbh,as korean methods one stricter costly methods schools large placed rather outer reigions(less dense urban outskirts) use normal social distancing,masks hand sanitaizers. exactly. may better awhile could get slot walmart target pick 2 weeks out. food, guess better hope survive body fat 2 weeks get time slot curbside pick Obvious troll obvious statements made executives plan bring outside staff, county judge harsh words plan - stated goal goal Harris county need bring additional health care workers, needed respond actively.

I think upper end chart used ""unsustainable surge"" still unsustainable also think patient outcomes suffering soon reach even sustainable surge. would argue subtly lying renaming phase 2 phase 3, outright lying claim even surge past achievable.

I see indications they're lying currently occupied beds though. fun policing reddit. Make sure stay line. Q disinfo nonsense. unrelated accounts 2018/2019 even know could die flu. ignoramus. lol much changed life, office. Save time travelling, home daughter gets back school. Still game evening gamer friends. Go essential groceries. Idk, maybe locked entire country, US 50 states would agree eachother lockdown, going happen.

Also locking 25 million people much easier locking 330 million people. Good move knew back March stayed air 3 hours pretty clear reason want meet trump trump's failure handle covid. Justin's met often deals trump pretty well.
That handshake humiliated trump still something jerk day. German started AMA topic...

It size regular qtip went back nose. hold swirl around 15 seconds nostril I’m honestly glad virus ~1% kill rate worst. Imagine something like 10% 20%. think society would collapsed case.

Alright buddy Hospitalization, ICU admissions daily deaths steadily decreasing two months now

No longer excess mortality

Shit bad back April, situation lot better Tampa running ICU beds. Six hospitals full. Saturday 38 beds left entire county like ten hospitals.

Imperial County California transfered 500 patients out. They're near Arizona patients flown Bay Area Riverside, San Diego LA can't handle corona overflow. One four tests corona positive California whole 5.5% positive, 4.4% testing people. going up- dramatically Imperial County drowning. moved 500 patients- county less 300 hospital beds. insanity.

Not everywhere 'handling fine'. Yes no. It’s good personal hygiene. remains unknown viral load able delivered via hands viral load contract COVID. remains unknown. 

But, know forever forward. wash damn hands. incentive , nothing else work ! Fab idea..USA..listen up.This work say body , choice refuse wear masks..starting Presudent Vice President ! Sure logic air travel exist either... Yeah yeah, got it. wanted share prespective here. got sarcasm loud clear.

(And also vent little corrupt class country, tbh) like 100 people 4th block. Almost nobody mask Sadly schools universities teach critical thinking. ideally should, don't. 1. 4th July weekend, there's reporting lag. 2. Younger people making larger portion infected they're much better surviving hospital stay. 3. Overall deaths projected pop late July/August. YYG showing pop now. 4. Deaths rising hotspots states already. Canadian didn’t vote Trudeau, I’m really happy handing absolutely guaranteed another term. Hopefully comment isn’t “p0litical” sub, p0litical conversations almost *always* highly relevant. Lol You’re deleting comments Karen. true. politicized individual level well, warps perception handling individual level. don't, travel ban studies suggesting average disappear 2 months. puts even March outside average.

Even article states immunologist finds immunity SARS Cov2 confusing. honestly ton unanswered questions holes understanding human immune system.  He's tested multiple times per day, anyone comes within stone's throw tested, guess, given president, probably gets plasma transfusions antibodies. Wishful thinking aside, I'd shocked Trump ever gets (doubly shocked actually announce it, triply shocked actual truth). Interesting fact Trump’s grandfather actually died flu 1918 pandemic. Elementary kids far germiest. don’t understand social distancing, touch everything, they’ll touch faces. wouldn’t trust reopening school soon. Norway moose too. full coronavirus. probably worth pay premium. 

Also, Sweden's image badly harmed Geramny due poor coronavirus respones: Sweden, Norway Finland nice beaches there. let's pretend Denmark WAY average better quality. Also Denmark much closer Germany, bad COVID problem. forsee Germans switching Denmark Norway Sweden, esp given article linked quite put bad Swedish COVID response. agreed meeting late January. 😝😝😝 That’s implication articles hospitals reaching 100% capacity. point, isn’t bed enough nurses/doctors every patient. 

Both resources limited, they’re used consequence every patient need bed constant medical attention get it.

We set field hospitals, bring temps. Neither enough address exponential growth hospitalizations. don’t teachers unions state?  always copying revolutions! even know meaning existence CC. Agreed. want compare NYC testing april since similar percentage  I'm glad then, city made mandatory public place... hard breathe little, better getting sick! That's wrong.

Any idea Fauci keeps saying probably know anything works end said expects American public answer end year early 2021 whether one 140 experimental shots development proven safe effective. 3 times house within month crock shit honestly nervous hitting 20% number fly. way encourage compliance. big Fuck people pay back hundreds, thousands new cases. No, like that. all. Lmao cant even 6 feet correctly here. I've many people come within foot face grocery store, notice they're close move back like dropped something like person radioactive aura around them, look like I'm crazy...idiots...at least majority people wearing masks now...too little far late though.  want listen, can’t get fact “fart” part link... less hospitalized patients, good news anyway. else expect? would use ,,5 gallon container shower/shave recycle waste water roommates shower.

Can anyone point direction discussion critical analysis list? Youre wrong again.


People mask tend keep distance. Probably constant reminder there's pandemic raging (careful, PDF)
Abstract:
Background
Without proven effect treatments vaccines, Social Distancing key protection factor COVID-19. Social distancing alone enough protect virus, yet things gone differently, big mismatch theory practice. reasons? big problem actual social distancing data, corresponding people behavior pandemic unknown. collect world-first dataset social distancing COVID-19 outbreak, see first time people really implement social distancing, identify dangers current situation, find solutions future pandemics.
Methods
Using sensor-based “social distancing belt” collected social distance data people Italy two months critical COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, investigated wearing various Personal Protection Equipment, like masks, influences social distancing.
Results
Without masks, people adopt counter-intuitively dangerous strategy, paradox could explain relative lack effectiveness social distancing. Using masks radically changes situation, breaking paradoxical behavior leading safe social distance behavior. shortage masks, DIY (Do Yourself) masks also used: even without filtering protection, provide social distancing protection. Goggles recommended general use, give extra powerful safety boost. Generic Public Health policies media campaigns work well social distancing: explicit focus behavioral problems necessary mobility needed.

TL;DR study done italy distance. People keep distance wearing mask. infos actual graphs study

I understand state local governments fault lets pretend takes 1/40 million fuck plan discussing pandemic. 

Shit every state still pretty high numbers triple quadra digits. international students forced home then? home country accepting travelers? anyone break summarize legal speak? oh is- line move pretty quickly people always lining line always stays longish. I’m NH haven’t seen this. I’m curious age breakdown. defining kids? One thing people taking consideration NY spread started slow one 5 New Yorkers tested positive antibodies month ago. saying herd immunity 43 percent. isn’t binary thing. additional immune person population makes spread slower, halfway would significantly slow spread. Plus south hotspots now, happened weather got really hot people started spending time inside air conditioned environments. frustrating. know unprecedented situation, we’ll probably awhile hope take look process realize many people agree let in, way get instead everyone shrugging shoulders passing buck.

Also note NY mayor de Blasio instructing tracers ask infected protests. go jail unpaid parking tickets? bode well? article nothing communicability it’s focuses entirely death counts 

Reading comprehension isn’t thing I'm aware couple cases US family coworkers associates (at least 2) experienced delay around 2 weeks period figuring essential continue versus could delayed.

This definitely happened too. that? Screw rest world access vaccine? 300m vulnerable people US, Trump lock pharma friends make killing, rolling pockets I’m sure. hope rest world produces version.

Harvard undergrads generally live campus (not grad students though) unlikely impact. colleges similar though definitely shot! Sensible move. Thanks - great article.

US prime example that. man know think speaking Nobody said wasnt true individual states.

There's really nothing extra needed things go south kids taking classes living rooms again. less populace states would get drowned populace states abolished electoral college.

For presidential election ***only***. 

Those states still representation government via systems. 

Literally idea states would get underrepresented singular vote 2 people fucking retarded. digital age presidents need touch sweaty ass home state make feel special anymore. 


But literally 1 election, 1 vote, 2 people. Boo fucking hoo 1 person fit like perfect puzzle piece exact needs wants state. Thats senators congressmen. zero good arguments system still place. Oh fucking god, idiot, it’s beyond me. 

Dear dogs - I’m sorry yelled. You’re good girls.

ETA: DeSantis claiming average age *new* cases 21. Even it’s dropped lot, seems crazy low average, considering Florida higher average age US. 

Are testing bunch school kids? making up?  There’s source listed. inexcusably immature behaviour. feel scared, cope scared. get use feelings excuse mental break reality murder someone. chemotherapies IV injected course several hours hospital setting numbnuts Hey look everyone guy starved attention ever breathing spit? Nope, that's thing people saying May reopening leading increased spread surge cases obviously wrong -- took time see reflected testing numbers. enough info yet guessing wrong best unethical talking people possibly dying. **I take mask shout megaphone hours understand might benefit feeling control get browsing sub, many, constantly hearing (often misleading) headlines COVID control give exact opposite effect. know felt way. worry, think inconsiderate. agree, think take break sub. thanks! I'll check /r/anxiety, I'm sure helpful! people jails petty crimes. sad fuck. We’ve went making fun shithole countries one. bottom fuckup we’re in? agree completely. original message strictest form serious, life threatening virus many yet fully understood knock-on effects (specially realm devastating auto-immune response/disease), exceptions serves undermine public faith government , deepen resentment leave unimpacted virus circle friends family doubt seriousness virus. Social cohesion trust government, opinion, among important factors sustainably combating virus nation.

I understand financial incentive understand could even make argument cheap entertainment may key getting long haul (surely debatable I'm one debate that, putting there). However, entire ""campaign"" failed get go when, frankly, culture minister could well made attempt populist justification none that. really feel ought say symbolic ""win"" would culture minister apply 14 days ""special class"". message would clear: virus bigger us. exceptions. Cruise ilk would still get movies. They'd chill posh estate two weeks. Especially consider fucked criminal justice system is, lot prisoners got railroaded plea agreements ”We still beat go you’d like.” government says virus problem stop testing instead? everybidy there? problem house hold parents (or parent single parent households) still work (and home.) parents going pay childcare normally paying for, they're also going teachers home, still help much case kids causing outbreak (since they'll still confined spaces kids daycare.) past two days I’ve lingering headache suddenly ear started ring (tinnitus like) last hour two. Could COVID? 7 people votes cast 2016. definitely common, faithless electors prevalent twice. Yeah, SARS MERS T-Cell response lasts years, one report read showed lasted 10 years although fades 2 years. Assuming covid response last 1-10 years depending individual. But, rate infection unlikely country get herd immunity suppressing virus working vaccine still best strategy. Yes. struck oddly low also. breathing test asthmatic people measures amount exhaled breath indication much inflammation tester lungs (&lt;25ppm good, bad). So, given article, seems people chronic lung inflammation decreased level risk Covid. hardcore right wing COVID deniers trying make reason wear mask.

No doctor going say someone need mask disability reasons. People pre-existing breathing issues much higher risk death COVID ones REALLY need masks.

Can imagine going doctor trying convince need DR note wear mask? Doctors wear masks every second shift along gloves PPE? fat Karen want wear mask? LOL. about. Stop smoking crack.  tell truth. say may understand this, whatever, lies answer. see, credibility got caught lying many times.  Yes, insignificant. comparing wrong magnitudes. Two points worth noting:

1. US weekly excess deaths *below* average, thousands. fewer Americans dying right compared alternate reality virus exist
2. CDC defines epidemic proportion weekly deaths associated given cause. proportion fluctuates depending time year, right boundary 5.9% (so virus causing deaths excess 5.9% total epidemic). SARS-CoV-2 currently right 5.9% line, **so bordering epidemic all** need supports corporations every country. went past herd immunity number (50-80%, depending listen to), kept going.

To countries want wait herd immunity, there's one way it. Infect everyone get with.

Or, ya know, admit herd immunity infection going right path, use common sense measures flatten curve continue develop effective treatments potential vaccine. Ffs, time socially distance homes 30 feet apart /s know live state many CVS locations offer car side testing. bring swab, tell it, collect car window. think argument depends lot whether virus aerosolized Well, typos like make seem like actually sweden spewing bullshit get attention. countries similar positive rates like Mass gone back school infrequent outbreaks. ""looking science"" likely saying go back school.

 studies schools countries big thing countries done much better job mitigating controlling spread virus US. would also interested seeing individual schools operated. Schools US already overcrowded many schools k-12 four year colleges unrealistic plans reopen flat cant follow guidelines space resources so. 

Furthermore, positive rates mean little long travel state still allowed. would help waved rather speak. memory questioned fair times add wire help. Cloth masks fitted sealed like n95 mask. They’re primarily limiting spread respiratory droplets may expel talking, coughing, sneezing. Sure don’t want super loose doesn’t tight it’s uncomfortable roaches carry COVID19 virus. People low income areas filthy houses get bit infected. Excellent point! Smart! Yep. Six feet. 

It's even gotten culture, least one musical artist writing recording song pandemic's effect lives, featuring distance.

The song is
[here]  AL, checks out. :/  stand corrected. first article details handful patients fact symptoms twice.

Second story similar others seen testing positive twice. Generally speaking things get better better time goes by, since knowledge ability fight virus continue grow. exact scenario NYC would lead bad outcome now. Things remain fine, unless massively miscalculate need treatment capacity. Even NYC taught lessons works need quickly ramp treatment capacity. Idk language barrier me. could would lot harder Canada.

Regardless two intrepid ""leaders"" to, Texans insane. soon Gov. Abbott required masks last week, lawsuit filed rescind order citing unconstitutional. weekend, conversation brother-in-law said, ""I'm businesses schools open long hospitals filling up. one data-point pay attention apolitically."" reply, ""Well, believe hospitals really filling up. They're lying."" Me, ""What? would say that?"" Him, ""Well, remember Dr. Faucci? lied masks."" Me, ""What?"" H, ""Yeah, lied."" M, ""What hospitals?"" H, ""Well, can't trust now. Plus, drive by, look full."" M, ""What? mean trying say they're full parking lots full?"" H, ""Yeah."" M, ""You remember visitors now, right? People brought in!"" H, ""I know, man. seem like DFW 80% full right now. look like true.""  


(sigh) kind line lot thinking, still think immunisation COVID-19 going possible fashion, looking increasingly likely it'll require frequent booster shots, sort like keep getting flu shot perhaps even frequently given results far, several times year. project group discussion Nature Medicine paper waning antibodies MDs epidemiologists saying, way study done indicated matter antibodies down, indicated memory B-cells memory T-cells really sticking around much either, stark contrast SARS MERS. (I'm expert immunology something serology immunoglobulin distribution that's fingerprint B-cell coordination, thus indirect indicator memory cell presence--I'll try dig commentary effect presented meeting.)

I mean, feel like overall bad news. maybe best news wanted since probably means able give single shot done it, ever able casually reopen economy like pre-covid normal (free flow goods people without worry pandemic spread), may hard return to. OTOH seem like there's path make manageable. feel like combination booster shots, better hospital treatments maybe ongoing degree judicious social distancing masks disruptive. feel like certainly something could adapt to. Unfortunately spent money lackluster coronavirus response :( [Here's link reuters folks survived ravaged. front page sub number articles regarding survivors significant lung damage. 

It’s dying. It’s quality life. Deaths go hospitals still fill quick. Sounds like county Highly doubt would free rest world, least country wont be. dont even mass testing despite loans national budget tapped government.  Yet wear seatbelts follow traffic rules etc SNAP SNAP Company fined 1.7 billion Medicare/Medicaid fraud CEO (largest settlement ever). got ""Scott"" free. Went become governor. heavily implied campaign made ""smart businessman."" 'Murica. what? CCP bad reason racist toward Chinese people? Yeah everyone seems extremely confident Oxford vaccine work. It’s nice little hope don’t want crushed doesn’t work, ya know Ah see we'd run risk pay nurses they'd training! Aka one quarter **25%** tried hard stay positive this. 

I can't imagine... Absolutely not! point! Ugh hope rest Canada too. I’m worried Alberta going to. Haha...so ability pay $35 per month gym membership privieged suggestion tolhat people buy home gym internet? 

Looks like conversation run course cvs home delivery drive-through options. Definitely want inside pharmacy would lot reassuring didn’t know what’s coming next weeks, death stat wise (most likely) 

://// need check people's social media posts deciding get ICU beds respirators. Thank link that’s thing, ever really clear virus begin with? Medicaid almost 6 years. actually lost Obamacare went effect. also lost indigent services. making 12 grand year. understand saying agree data yet. 

However argument ""it's fine 1% people dying/its like flu"" take consideration deaths caused indirectly. claiming take consideration data available. I'm saying taking consideration present argument. Check company remote policy tracker: remote.lifeshack.io Why? Let pay it... I'll believe reputable website picks up. Best luck friend. Health care workers strike. AGES MATTER!!! 🙄 source? wife said multiple times pre existing conditions. need bot this. It’s question over. sorry hear this. devastating go must almost 100 days ICU outcome. many periods hope awful setbacks. virus incredibly cruel. no, get worse, january, worse over, come april may, over, least mostly. States normally annual death count 200 pneumonia deaths 1000+. 

The US reporting lowest COVID death misrepresenting deaths. get results? Hope feel better!  Absolutely! Let Darwinism take wheel  whistleblower doctor died something like reinfection 

He getting better even testing negative died suddenly happy hypoxia whistleblower doctor died something like reinfection 

He getting better even testing negative died suddenly happy hypoxia low death rates though... know I’m huge fan apocalyptic movies, books, podcasts, video games. Would hate things happen. feel ok pandemic, could whole lot worse. if’s important actually happened? fit subreddit going lie. Yea, going want go back school might end like... me? Jeezus. I'll look botany horticulture muthafuckin jam. Young, haaawt tinderellas dude bros trying bag (not tough challenge, btw). older demographic, boomers seem like want kill many people possible they're getting kind kick it. undersample population, uncertainty (margin error) value measured much larger.

India's apparently lower rate statistically less reliable apparent US rate. risk vs reward. exactly mean going out? definitely want go secluded parks hikes. going crowded / indoor areas like bars/restaurants parties family watched neighbors shoot fireworks (from safety driveway). much illegal still decent show. make lasting connections bother? reopening still?

in work place customers abiding restrictions we've set place

Most people unfortunately care getting sick Great news effective lockdowns were. real shame people refuse look clear evidence see know stop disease. fair, Korea back plan now. would easier me. don’t think open either, think underestimating much make Florida resorts. I’ll admit I’m wrong hospitals completely overrun 2 weeks, stats I’m seeing seem point cases going without deaths same. pandemic tragedy, don’t act like people crippled left right even CDC saying 99.8% people survive catch virus. anything, it’s good virus burning young, healthy population. people keen avoiding virus, stay home. Don’t force rest us wear mask. feel like much higher. boyfriend currently delaying medical care due covid 🥴 really protect point. It’s probably worth it. ended shortsighted fucked economy worse. They've pushing hard kids go back school fall parents need taken care go work. Instead taking advantage home summer anyway, extending lockdown, bringing cases, making viable option...they opted instead get 6 weeks broken half functioning summer economic output.

Now they're finally come terms fact lock anyway actions kids going back school August probably happen either.

But hey, least restaurants got indoor dining 50% capacity little month. Big win. What?

Do want flip flop?

Viruses exploit weaknesses, flip flopping ultimate weakness.

Sure there’s overwhelming evidence things control Florida, something simple face mask could save hospitals getting overwhelmed thousands lives lost, what’s cost politician flip flopping?

It’s it’s like nothing. kinda closed bars time, pushed responsibility onto individual Florida man ensured they’d get clearly vague completely optional set recommendations could help stop spread. data visualization Tableau use track data: states report current hospitalizations. believe 4 not, one Florida. Theres several caveats national hospitalization view read beneath hospitalization chart, mainly states started reporting recently didnt historical data, adding data might skew national numbers somewhat. look individual states, data good.

Interesting states look Arizona, Texas, South Carolina, California. Dear god. Lost 60 lbs. amputated leg. Double F-ing lung transplant. Damn. Wear mask, people. Wear mask Wow. that’s it’s like competent government response crisis? Looks fun. :) believe already killed people risk would inevitably gotten disease anyway due x, y, z. can't keep killing people rate.. weak Covid-19 strong. mean best vaccine world ever seen? Yeah everyone following rules outside grocery store lined inside people care care one way aisles. least see lot people wearing masks now. seems indicate true IFR around 0.7% then, correct, Yeah clotting Covid got whole lot worse that’s works funny - post right one woman getting kicked hospital refusing wear mask reality clear thing US rest world also clears it. Ah. selfish, see. Sooooo friend supposed travel Va Brooksville three day class. I’m seriously considering cancelling Air BnB. I’m high alert enough getting 500-600 average cases day. friend isnt worried virus offered go class alone. reading this, think I’ve made mind up. wish could convince hers. situation 19.5% O2 hazardous. saying wearing mask low 02 environment safe mask protect low 02, filters particulate.

I would wear mask. want join coronavirus party Florida having. vaccine produce antibodies virus itself? vaccine developers make happen? Give vulnerable population first see happens. OK months, think lot people hesitant jump onboard. Hell ya poor family much I'm going level protest whip cock shop. Depends guess, watched CBC thing reporter went one teo weeks (I went mid June).

She said showed 2 hours opened wait two hours, leaving overheard security guard saying would 4 hours 

When went 45 minutes, surprised. report day like 25k tests done well (obviously site, one main Toronto testing centers same) numbers getting caught testing. Horrifying think what's actually happening. lung transplant : yes done covid patients. 

As leg: infection. developed severe clotting, tried give anticoagulant drugs, began bleeding internally. amputated reduce risk clots would kill +the clots going cost leg anyway. 25% mostly infected recover, mostly immune. least, that's understanding science currently understand it. perspective aligned yours. Certainly tremendous share world class universities. wrote comment, specifically thinking hardships many (most?) teachers experience terms budget class size well concept home schooling. general impression home schooling kids far less prepared next iteration development academically socially home schooling, versed studies related that. Education inequality, similar wealth inequality, seems substantial US. I’ll get it... make let guys go first weird all. first time I’m able go something wouldnt think right now, like karaoke favorite bar, going best feeling. There’s also anecdote doctor regarding re-infection first portion newest episode Week exactly they’re there, US. Literally copy them. It’s simple. Doubt though. understand happening. state, liquor enforcement strict, set beer front someone 20 years 364 days old, get liquor license suspended almost immediately. That's whole point liquor license: serving safely according state guidelines, license revoked tens thousands liquor sales lost. 

We toe fucking line.  He’s pretty lucky. Many people fighting years. grandfather caught flu bad strain going around. Ended hospital came back months later traech, regular dialysis, huge medical debt, inability walk, etc. took 10 years die.

This disease going killing people long time. People say “I want catch get with” ignorance long term impact saddening. Here's [actual track data know scientist read Facebook? getting 0.26% from? think zigzagging you’re seeing probably every 3 days number deaths cases reviewed accounted along day’s new numbers. like every days there’s asterisk next new case numbers, note specifying many infections deaths come review process. 

Also, active case numbers, zigzagging lot, think published like week, think people collecting data take number, add daily new cases it, adjust active case number updated. Like anything.

I'm saying American too. Nobody else suffer overflow idiots. know me? always told ""Man, time I'd spend time kid"" ""I would learn many little hobbies crafts time.""

no wait, really funny. Bruh Holiday weekend suppressed numbers.

The numbers much higher week goes Riiiiighhhhhttt.....Sure...... 

Its totally stabilized like magic... even 4th July weekend.... criminal punished biologically. Anyone defending virtue signalling (look much want punish baddies, great?) sociopath. basically, zero risk incredibly safe job.

Tell 116+ families lost loved one 2020 (*so far*). MuH FrEeDom!! convenient That's true, although picturing ""Doctor"" character. “It’s surely they’re ready next record break! According 7 day averages Worldometer, first peak US cases April 10 32,434 new cases. peak deaths occurred 11 days later (April 21) 2,255 deaths. US surpassed original peak case number 12 days ago (June 24) 32,444 cases reported. rolling average deaths continued trend down, 511 - that's 22% peak levels. always hated Americans. cares ones might vote him, even care lives Trump: “U up?” (3:23am)

Trudeau: [read] (3:24am) think lot people risk isn’t real, hence lack masks. read something like maybe they’ll think twice. Plus, regardless common situation might be, still incredibly brave literally gave life patients. comment comes across disrespectful dismissive sacrifice. Viruses ""intentions"". Let's anthropomorphicize things even know alive not. Viruses, like everything else, mutate become less virulent. nothing Malthusian nonsense. Yeah boy, bet I’d enjoy lockdown home gym well. implying knows think speaking? See talk old people tell it’s young person problem clap cheer.

It’s science. agree everything public defender bit, represent clients vigor “Merica” people 2 metres around themselves.  look chart US cases time, 7-day average started climbing around June 16th, hence said 2-3 weeks ago. cant speak individual states.

And said number reasons deaths declined: better treatment options, younger/healthier people getting infected, asymptomatic/mild cases identified, etc. There's reason think deaths continue decline keep seeing exponential growth cases though.

All there's precisely zero data back notion recent rise cases simply due testing. Dude shut up, way real .... mean realistic ones? Ok when? We’re 2 weeks consistent 30-50k daily cases lowest Monday total weeks hurricane level spin I’ve ever seen it. Ever heard mandatory vaccines? done insensitive American Tourists planning party Rocky Point 4th July weekend. Actually, one ~~steroid~~ corticosteroid (Dexamethasone) known reduce mortality covid patients.        
It change point though. Mhhm, yeah, people calling racist xenophobic dog whistles real racist. Ok guy. convenient jump pneumonia deaths like Texas... Vaccine-induced enhancement issue early sars vaccines money dried disease burnt final vaccine go human trials. known issue scientists aware apparently resolved. Came say same-puppets. Tbh remembered recently started posting studies it.

My sister who's doc said that's things work, keep antibodies forever. 

I know doctor/literature discussing earlier mentioning antibodies failed bring t-cells up. specific information had?  live Svalbard, family mostly Sweden we're currently herding Finnmark. guess that's confusion came from, sorry. Bogus. peer reviewed evidence actually happens opposed speculation?  need real information. afaik crime all! usps! Nobody saying COVID spread reopened. entire selling point lockdowns ""flatten curve"", eliminate virus wait vaccine. one wouldn’t consider poor girl “obese”? definitely wouldn’t imagine would negatively impacted virus based that. Prayers family. Another tragic story showing serious pandemic is. problem people reassuring affects people pre-existing condition probably pre-existing condition.

I walk people mask way trash say 'mask', week I've already pull pepper spray back somebody me. even Florida.

In two three weeks Florida's numbers going roof. need many toddlers getting get average 21 Link? saying wrong, saying heard anything tests less reliable others. Lol hope too, certainly optimistic. Florida state government taking Ned Flanders' parents' approach: ""We've tried nothing we're ideas!"" roses people still refuse wear masks. correct. So, constituents far he's concerned know staff well? sure workplace dynamic looks like. harsh, thinking future college, current boss would last person I’d listen to. might polite face privately I’d thinking mind fucking business. surprised one listening you.

Plus, may good advice all. many defer year, may really mess admissions unforeseen ways next year. get creative. http://archive.is/iIs6S Hoping narcissist something good? others? There’s also lot coronavirus cases there. guy true dingus keep using word, think means think means Yeah, what’s new fancy basic part immune system people keep throwing around? America’s unjust judicial system definitely sympathetic population me. Poor? Take plea deal, even though didn’t it, punish making us go trial costing us time money.  Hmm ... anyone else notice we've ""approaching"" hospital capacity long time now? like Zeno's Paradox. made sense. Cases Florida. Deaths up. Many people Michigan died. Whitmer incompetent fool needlessly killed thousands citizens. Hardly DeSantis's constituents died comparison. way 5.2% 2nd wave. Herd immunity right around corner. Well look BLM protests see lot faces masks, Trump basically said uncool wear one, he's going to. Well shit! lived Canada I'd keep border closed too! Hell, even Mexico closing borders parts US, smart part....

Its shit show US lot fellow Americans zero respect, responsibility, accountability part stopping spread virus especially neighboring countries. wouldn’t recommend unless you’re clearly sick, swab tests often miss mild cases  IZ NONE MAIN MAN BUZZ LIGHTYEAR. BOYAKASHA.1 Oh man, believe, definitely don’t look recovery rate. disappointed  Florida fucked  Yeah Trump going get cronies vote even people voted Biden.

You want apply highest possible standard people want look bad.

A business visit isn’t dangerous. party dangerous. No. patient somebody receiving medical care regardless they’re at. Hospital, clinic, infusion center, CT scanner, etc. Patients also home they’re getting care via telehealth. Anti-maskers despicable. get feeling, plan flying boston see next month, bought tickets I'm happy something look forward to. probably western PA roots speaking, Mountaineer smarter you, something brag about. episose South Park, Canada closed border humongous wall?

These cartoon really predicting future, arent they? Stay beach community! Lol yes – it’s fairly common vaccines require regular boosters people get new vaccines awhile. curious watch Twitter vid?

Yes. watched random video. media hypocrisy astounding.

How cannot go beach 90 sun socially distance safely, yet parties streets get free pass?

Who got free think local government dealing FED

Then wrong. global, national pandemic purview FED. exist. Nobody happy this, assure you. Probably right call, aside money it’s huge disappointment student who’s truly busted ass get schools. upvoted comments thread talking 'introvert paradise' 'lockdown amazing'. That's evidence enough right there. providing 1 example (yourself) exception. stands, going 200k 300k cases within week Florida. stabilized?

No one's gone ""he's died covid? What's underlying issues?"". always that's terrible. 

Except tried justify whatever silly idea killed inherently ill really sound like Trumpist back early March. think set number relevant, test need tested, promise million wouldnt care. even set number? yeah, 100.000 completely irrelevant me. 
And realise task regions? centralised effort... dont even know region get Health Care yes get antibody test water starting rise, cant even see crest wave yet. dislike Swedish people community, treat family BS even kids still go bloody 21st century. 
I dislike Swedish people always act high mighty comes PC, treat Sámi like second class people. 
I dislike lot Swedish even know history Sapmi Sweden like.
My wish Sweden, Sámi treated respect, Sámi children go school Gákti, without getting send home ""costume"" appropriate causes get bullied.
My wish Sweden, Sámi speak language public, without yelled ""this Sweden"".
So get Sweden handing passport I'll walk sysselmannen first thing tomorrow morning. going happen therefore stay help family build Sweden want see. Young, healthy, dead.

Thanks asshokes can't mildly inconvenienced order stop global fuckin pandemic hear spreading places happen frequently. also hear coronavirus quite contagious establishments well.... 😊 Oh go hell, I’m sick selfish pieces shit. Stock toilet paper next pandemic. Nothing extreme like 100 rolls! 100,000+ also died. Let's rush celebrities occupy fawning grieving simultaneously. Plenty others died need attention well. work ok, sort thing I'm actually confused reactions comment section. Get hobby. Thank you! course it’s bunch “All Lives Matter” assholes. hOaX

I want stab people fucking eyes. Canadian, I'm curious happens people hospitalized COVID-19 financially, OK? anything covered? heard testing tested people going ICU (10% nation without healthcare) financial death sentance manage live it? need 30 years system many places, get pension. That's pension exists anymore. terrible. I've following story fighting hard. poor family. said exact words genuine saying it, would potentially giving someone support needed maybe better day something. keep pushing forward difficult life know details about. 

Same sentence, words, comment instead would uplift make feel alone. know needed not, that's point. know someone going through, do, experience it. 

You choosing make worse exact words could used change night life needed someone care. 

Don't think that's least little fucked up? genuine question: really care all? That's argument? 

Here's mine: know population sorts massive events mind wearing mask, regardless reliable (or affordable) medical system might be... Trump wants re-elected already said bigger stimulus coming. Democrats already board, likely happen Deaths lag cases. need ventilator first place? already know survival rate ventilator fairly low Article doesn’t provide anything suggests doesn’t come China.

Not originating China makes absolutely zero sense. Exponential growth takes while, analyzed hospital traffic suggest [the coronavirus outbreak may started Let’s fix shit go stomping someone else’s land. Hey! That's pretty good! mean, I'm lawyer graduated law school 2010. major class action lawsuits initiated huge portion peers, schools cooking employment statistics paint far, far rosier picture reality reflected.

They result much, agree likely flurry litigation lot us see coming (the effective bait-and-switch on-campus experience promised last minute students switched distance learning full price), really hard prove intention.

It easy schools say ""well really thought would safe, really know WOULDNT safe late, option put everyone risk that"". worse, petri dish vileness spread country. People going bring back disease places across country. That's definitely interesting. half cases do, recovered. 75% would still take though. That's good enough Never mind. never real 'lockdown' AZ. That's right. get elective medical emergency. Even semi elective carries higher classification. Hah, know better forget “usually” disclaimer comments. You’re covered, people don’t react strongly America bound determined repeat NYC scenario overrun hospitals, national scale. treatment may better, national outpouring assistance, rest country outbreaks deal with.

It's akin outbreaks Spain, France, UK Germany following initial Italian outbreak. know, actually [illegal teachers strike state story, lose teaching certificate went school 4-8 years for, able teach anymore, find entirely different line work.

So remember people say ""we open schools!"" literally forcing people choose safety livelihood. We're point start seriously weighing negatives lockdowns. kids social development, need to. mess government actually handled properly populace think masks go freedom. Sure, COVID would still here, could live relatively normally. Remindme! 11 days Oxford also based vaccine MERS one already lying around, pretty much knew safe already. fucking quit. Thanks input 👍 🙄 know airborne? I’ve heard 30 feet since January. Apparently 1/4 Americans idiots assholes. maybe wear mask burning masks. knows chemicals releasing burning them. many people believe already it. live county next O.C. I'm surprised. country Riverside worse. ol' turning blind eye, eh? work out. Fuckkkkking wtf give reason, states exactly title says. also says Brasil behind US number confirmed cases deaths. Oxford actually started Phase 3 months ago. entered Phase 3 nations recently one UK gone awhile. team said May would good idea efficacy June. July 5th still nothing  I’m longer going debate seriousness virus actively ignore arguments life long disability. 

Cloth masks actually lot good. Here’s evidence back probably covid cant afford $35 gym membership lecturing people buy gym eqiupment internet least twice that? 

You quit behind force teachers staff families take responsibility risk? let's forget families students Hi, person living big bad cluster b personality disorder wear mask fear abandonment strong can't anyone life peacing thanks Covid. Literally 3 slides feed Karen refusing wear mask emergency room. kind Dr Strange timeline in? underplaying virtually everything virus beginning.

Other spreading confusion misinformation, exactly do? understatement. number downvotes received speaks volume statistical illiteracy Reddit masses (and masses large suppose). shame too, without capacity understand **and question** numbers they're constantly fed, people tend accept they're told. Generally people agenda. That's great points. really ICU admissions new big negatives. go ICU there's good chance long term permanent health problems. chronically tired, damaged lungs, secondary infections. dying. Username checks out. would planning massive person event masks social distancing one biggest hotspots country.

But aren't, sorry can't push bullshit thread. every day around live 4th July....... line imaginary cultures vastly different people still nerve say hoax real. can't. 

I hope rests peace, heart goes family. God sad. post possibility origin besides China, like heard weeks outbreak. People.are commenting guys physical attributes..... I'm confused. Never really thought that...good point. humans, every reason believe one here.

I get kinda annoyed people say vaccinating COVID19 impossible take years sadly there's real way around it. feels like two common elements found Earth day age nitrogen human stupidity. Good explanation here. would also like add that:
1. Many initial infections occurred hospitals people already hospitalized immunocompromised reasons. Covid higher morbidity population.
2. Many northeastern states still seeing decreasing death totals outweighing rising death totals states. mean death totals in, e.g., Texas, Florida Arizona going though.
3. takes 3 weeks even longer infection potentially turn recorded death! there's incubation period two weeks beginning well week death may get immediately helpful article understand what's going on. look sexier boxer briefs. Maybe get revolution started! wanna see bulge No! I’ve following story months wondering yesterday. beyond tragic. poor family. Nobody take vaccine. One side thinks it’s Bill Gates mark beast side low trust administration aren’t going trust anything US puts out. good question raises questions own. there's issue Navy sailors, negative tests COVID-19 positive (symptomatic, positive tests) after. Unless tests giving false negatives, seems extremely unlikely, standard medical investigative standard, cleared virus. OTOH reactivation (uncleared) virus, better immunologically? mean least patients (presumably young healthy here), body finds reservoirs linger body with? Aww, Kommandat chief said would work! takes like 7 times day! feeling 2021 extreme opposite 2020 compensate unfortunate events happened 2020. Arizona. Look post viral syndrome. happened SARS too. Wow positive news. Well obvious argument in-person schooling necessity others. Sure, people get infected die wouldn’t in-person schooling didn’t happen, gotta send kids somewhere people get back work. 

I want make sure it’s super clear ACTUALLY MAKING ARGUMENT. think distance learning, especially states severe spikes. I’m letting know side saying.  got new mole doubled size 3 months. Im scared getting sick going dermatologist. might they're talking about. redicul worry, barely even half-assed contact tracing here. Can't fork something exist 😐 Yes, him. LA Mayor Garcetti vacation? Seems like heard weeks. need knife training safety you’re going carry knife.

Getting stabbed knife fun happens time. live Toronto tell still lot people (of ages) going days without mask Europe 50k deaths touted much better job US. think I'd rather virus dead it. Visa qualifications standpoint. Although, probably qualify Express Entry Canada. Actually deductible. Spanks Kiwis! sad news. wife followed story pretty closely. thought gonna pull albeit long tough recovery ahead him. Tragic. I've following story since April, honestly, I'm surprised lasted long did. really, kind quality life would had? sad situation around. hope rests peace, heart goes family. 

But yes, till hoax people really dying. Try telling family. Cases started ramping 3 weeks ago. Hospitals started overflowing last week.

The dying increase dramatically toward end week. hell downvoted you. Here’s upvote. thought united states couldnt get dumb $1,200 fines them. 🙄 Lol tf people think way? people committing crimes always racist attitudes, feel emboldened justified carrying racist acts Ahhh culling herd. think NBA actually gets Orlando, it’s them.

Otherwise, thankful I’m motorsports fan, too. Nothing see here, 59,036 cases extremely healthy, virile 18-24 year old asymptomatics got tested abundance caution Literally conversation friend last night. husband showing symptoms they’re young it’s mild. says can’t get tested 14th medications counter anyway unless hospitalized point getting tested. happy medium New Zealand people respect law manage situation well. I'd say people ICU sick we? Wooo! *high five* service job well good looking shit job figuring out. everyone works. lost $250,000 revenue got $1,000 PPP lol. Well lucky them...can send ICU patients northern neighbor since ICUs filling US? running capacity would certainly cause deaths deaths increase.

Even NYC never really came close ""running beds"" even peak. surge capacity rolled never used pretty much all.

Texas even remotely close running beds. still 13k free beds surge capacity.

That number remained nearly flat month. 

If deaths start rising massively next week become clear dynamics infection significantly changed (not mild mutation) point Texas hospitalizations started rising 1st week June. Deaths slightly up. We'll see week major upswing occurs. month past hospitalization admittance take off. Hospitalizations death lag month.  keep us US probably continue great. Right. hope one wins race, fortuitous MERS vaccine meant process least drastically sped up.

Also ""traditional"" tech, loooong good safety record vaccines made manor. idea, I'm saying went ICU blood clotting starting understood major COVID19 symptom.

This poor guy many secondary complications. Thank information. understand, many are. least CA. wait. Saw National News bunch idiots sandbar Diamond Lake, MI. 
Freaking idiots!!!  Gonna honest, foot fucked ages. Initially thought gout (not prevalent female, unheard of). description feeling early on, like glass crystals breaking joints pretty spot on. 

However, used first joint toe it’s immediate joint connects toe foot. doesn’t feel like cracking, throbs pretty much nonstop. Tylenol, Advil Ibuprofen nothing it. 

However, I’m pretty much waiting things die bit. I’m relatively hard hit area going doctor right seems like terrible idea. 

It may stupid, considering mask ordinances one seems taking safety precautions including stupid governor, wait—for now. Quite balancing act either get slightly expensive booze LCBO increase risk getting covid. dilemma. count vaccine end year? get lucky great question. meetings papers news reports group citing (including medical gurus lot smarter am), seems like emerging picture body capable mounting least acute COVID-19 immunity (otherwise clear initial infection), highly variable patient patient, possibly even within given patient, depending initial parameters infection (things like viral load capacity mount immune response). Chinese study Nature Medicine representative, means immunity drops pretty fast, within perhaps 3 months, clear much immunity protective, ex. someone would vulnerable second half period antibodies might primarily non-neutralising month in. (The researchers considered possibility memory B- T-cells hanging around something findings indicated that's unlikely too, much less persistence SARS MERS.)

Still take optimistic scenario antibodies infection would stretch to, say 3 months they're truly neutralising, indeed develop vaccine mimic protection, arguably could develop something like ""quarterly"" COVID-19 booster given 3-4 times year, particularly things like vaccine adjuvants boost resopnse. We'd still wary sudden outbreaks, mutations leading different strains high viral loads could overwhelm immune response, feel like sort booster system might get us somewhere within range making manageable long boosters coupled public health vigilance (including mask-wearing social distancing outbreaks pop there's high cluster cases R0 greater 1) better hospital management patients active illness. Annoying perhaps, still seems like could doable. Asia wear masks time even cold. Please note place really happened NYC, barely used tent hospitals. Also cuomo didn’t help situation letting COVID patients sent nursing homes...letting spread kill more. don’t think Texas get there. don’t believe people dying streets. Cuomo created problem NYC. think virus kills LTC elderly spreads new location kill LTC elderly. whole point college force learn person schedule. capacity learn remotely. know demographic voted governor ?

are smarter now, continue dumbfucks? anyone lost leg due COVID-19. strange heartbreaking case. understand virus kill anyone I’ve never heard someone losing limb. person you’re responding doesn’t believe single word you’re saying. 

Stay safe! explain nearly identical viruses found bats China. 

We've known long time potential vector.

With travel way around world, means nothing. get ton Chinese tourists every major tourist location. extremely unlikely would contained China actually circulating previously less infectious form. Maybe optional health care, necessary health care. man looks like day 40 still gonna lead effort China world's next pandemic one.

Rent 1br 10k traffic awful Man, that's effed up. wear it, waste hospital space time get it. there's covid thing Good. line much shorter. Bezos drop off. Oh yes definitely know allll well. wanted see perspectives topics getting worked it! gotten covid let's say 2 days ago think would would still alive 90 days now? heard trying stay alive cuz want leave behind 1 year old kid. Fuck man, that's sad. new answer ""where u night?"" - "" protesting fighting ur rights, bout thank woman"". Naaw.. lookin titties club Y’all keep harping protests keep creating strawmen. doesn’t seem like really want respond present evidence, think might bad faith. 

Idk protests. Wear mask. 

Here’s evidence indicating Covid long lasting impact body. I’m sure you’ll move goalposts. links previous debate someone. guess I'm curious breaking point is. 10% sick? many people you, statistically assholes would probably come woodwork too. That’s great point!! terrible street take dog (he’s deaf likes look fireworks) inside smoke minute two. Poor animals 😪 Jesus, suggesting? Apparently guys don’t get it. economy needs Disney 

/s Death rates many states. Here's clues may be.

* Indiana: 1,832 COVID-19 deaths; 2,149 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 384)
* Illinois: 4,856 COVID-19 deaths; 3,986 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 782)
* Tennessee: 336 COVID-19 deaths; 1,704 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 611)

* West Virginia: 72 COVID-19 deaths; 438 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 117)

Data sourced &amp; taken bestof post 2 weeks ago. lot north east. Oh, man. heart goes family. remember hearing tragic circumstances faced. went much. Everything Trump speak says sure code opposite, assume:

""A vaccine arrive long end year."" Considering much (United States) no-go zone rest world, allowed travel areas world, we're likely extended recession probably go depression. Unemployment big issue least another year wait vaccine come online and/or finally virus control. meanwhile, world move without us. city emphasized refuse make masks mandatory, private businesses call police someone trespassing (which would case refused follow business’ mask policy, thus turned away, refused leave). making rational decisions, many people.

That's too. realized many fellow Americans lost minds. Masks helpful reducing rates, prescription whatever want, whenever want. evidence since day one airborne disease, droplet borne one, giving people false hope masks make every okay totally irresponsible. need something critical, I'll take calculated risk, whatever protect myself, get haircut go eat. That's fucking stupid matter wear face. bats cause covid lost job insurance. stayed home tried comfort dogs. Illegal use fireworks city limits course surrounded. Good lord you’re desperate. Exponential growth grows nature Wow... aaaaaahahahahahahahahahahaha Hail yeah. Lets get it. Beat covid!! is, yes. 

At time something proactively treated like think try now. really solution good luck everyone. PLEASE make voices heard! 

I do, called ""distance learning"". that, mean 3 Zoom classes week students even show for. mean properly-planned micro video lectures stopping points video ask questions reinforce engagement, interesting lesson work students engage in, 1:1 synchronous chat students need additional support, etc. students CANNOT distance learn home, open school much smaller set students, focus better social distancing, masks, hand-washing, etc. (but still use distance-learning material peers).

Most executive branch pushing states re-open. shameful, tragic, going end hundreds thousands deaths next months. avoiding cant afford it, always Damn!!! suffer amputation?

Did get thrombosis anything like that? That's probably one severe cases person covid-19.

I know case like happened him...Did doctors explain exactly happened detail? I'm really curious.  Florida lying deaths. [The Foundations published 1997. honestly think cultural peak US late 90’s. know bunch bad shit going then, truly feels like downhill ever since. 

...and yes believe Russia planning destroy us inside ever since end USSR. implemented immediately instead giving headstart leave border closes. stop testing there’s new cases *taps head* Indeed thanks. Flu kills folks Good bot far commenters ignorantly mouthing assumptions reading article looking Mayor Nirenberg done last months.

He's constantly pushing stronger restrictions enacting sooner shot consistently governor higher ups.

They ramping testing asymptomatic people limited number tests available, workers available provide them, labs available process quickly growing number symptomatic people take precedence asymptomatic.

Take five minutes learn talking regurgitate talking points. Isnt clotting cause covid ? Maybe new mutated strain less deadly contagious. good news me. American dying!!! human that. wait till 4th July parties start kick Put Canada search engine compare US’s mobility curve Canada’s. US’ shutdown equally deep look last bali m, mask compliance higher US Canada. Private Healthcare pay every month? New York report recovered cases LiBrUlS! apps fucking genius. Puns aside, that’s almost 2,000 people who’ve lost jobs. Wow thank link. idea actual name real. Sure must room exceptions due content here, thought brain might've completely wrong track. least holds rail read somewhere purposeful didn’t increase production keep demand/profits high. wish making up. Yes bigger problem latest surge represents right present. high level ICU capacity covered dates research looking at. fully envision scenario talking we've already seen Italy.  'leader' literally said wants less testing. I've made comment sub before, lot people's reactions pandemic emotional, rather logical. really way deal virus direct way (making go away), resort emotion-reliant indirect coping. Even flu kill healthy young people peak 1,756 deaths April 12th. rate two month deaths US. already shut bars rivers week last reduced restaurants 50%. Water parks hand still going strong. doubt tried get back wife baby.

May rest peace. think see repeat roaring 20s nightlife booms everyone wants get house. Parties music art everywhere. That's odd... Mine said maybe. Yeah well hope get 100 times tomorrow. 10 times next day. like one user's idea rcmp escort alaska ban crossing border. fly back alaska buy new car, fuck assholes. actually MUCH cheaper get booze literally bar town get LCBO. It’s wind also flu vaccine, covid. comparisons unnecessary person sounds like they're downplaying situation. Holy shit... poor workers.. fk cruise lines paying them. werent people buy regardless. Everything already stock march. like stores stock. exactly one choose there. don’t money proper attorney. saying it’s fine use prisoners forced labor?  99% probably die, ton likely long term health conditions really 'okay'. Seriously, even everyone world fell behind academics, worth keep people alive?

I children, never will. did, would absolutely pull homeschool them, even much learning got accomplished, keep us safe. (Given joke homeschooling regulations US anyway...)

A problem schools major vehicle social services, like free lunches. answer reopen schools, bring services need them. Good job homie. deamon, dad's joke. Respect, stay thing. Peace. one ever treated unfairly. Yep. Hospitals healthcare workers going extraordinary efforts stretch capacity, ludicrous think quality care suffer everyone result. rich people want go back work. reason want children go back school even though it’s unsafe. alternative government spend money public services, clearly unacceptable ruling class. two weeks hasn’t? consequences “experts” bet.  5 arrested. people aren’t built endure lockdowns long have, end sight + added economic anxiety

Mental health going evidently problem. disastrous time Christ, terrible policy. Unfortunately, zoom green area New England, looks like someone bending headless turtle checking backside.

*I always failed ink blot tests.* varies city, French bus drivers typically check whether people tickets not. That's job ""contrôleurs"", travel randomly teams 4 5, prepared deal unruly passengers. Public transportation companies generally lot working night, people may chance it.

Masks dogs different though, affect safety passengers. milk contain recombinant bovine growth hormone think many Canadians stick Canadian milk. people wondering, spring semester, ICE made exemption, due pandemic, students visa take one online course.

That rule rescinded. profound implications:

* student US visa either leave quickly transfer another school attend college/university that's moved online-only.

* leaving abruptly easy built life here, may even possible take online courses countries, due internet issues/blocks, time difference, access local resources.

* Schools great number students visas immense pressure offer courses in-person, even though safe so.

* policy change kick brightest minds US attracted, including student researchers working pandemic.

Edited add: [An important brought almost certainly going challenged court. can't give anyone specific legal advice cases (especially expert student visas), encourage anyone book flight ""home"" exact moment.

Also, many older people really care labels . think need progressive president many many people eating health insurance lobby’s propaganda decades. would hard enact doubt. Single payer systems also unpopular countries enacted become extremely popular system developed. People status quo bias also want change. right call charge less online stuff lot old people. Bad combination. Thanks condolences.

My family pretty front end life decisions prolonging life quality life. father fear death afraid \*tortured\* end years although endure ""procedures"" doctors tried balance congestive heart failure kidney issues necessary diuretics, luckily painful end died fairly classic death old age. week died stopped eating drinking lapsed fitful unconsciousness. Yes dangerous everybody risk mean things like happen fact literal children dying common happens less risk mean can't die front Exactly -- surge ICU space comes from. hoping people responsible hit surge ceiling, I'm optimistic right now. That's says. 

It says expects answer regarding vaccine use end year/beginning 2021. could taken precautions staff avoid letting first place. 

After contact tracing providing enough sanitary supplies masks cut spread. 

Basically opposite treating like human zoo Oklahoma run profit.  Map little done certainly feel caution Canada. Yeah exactly, first testing started low ramped people started dying. first peak new cases represents point testing caught rather peak new cases. Testing quadrupled 3 week period.

The peak positive percentage 1st April. would question matter?

What odds know real identities people also protest?

Unless odds high both: 1: know identities others came near contact protest 2: going accurately provide identities, question pointless. COVID-19 real disease.

* Co-morbidities (diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, compromised immune system)

* Employment customer-facing roles/roles higher risk encountering droplets/aerosols (housekeeping, waitstaff, service employees, home healthcare workers)

* Concentrated areas lacking monetary support (poor already, limited/no supplemental income allow shelter-in-place) Maybe drop price bit Mental health first thought, too. stressful times in, we’ll see people begin act like this. It’s serious problem we’ll face require empathy...

But ofc redditors sneering Karen They'll mix yearly flu shot. different.  never said anything ""unbiased news source"". Maybe meant respond someone else. Wake might get different perspective world works outside city live in. say serve white people? That’s kinda biased. mean don’t like Scheer don’t serve white people. options Prime Minister turd shinier. Well lost coworker whose risk factor grew poor. 

Perfectly healthy. virus used swim 2 km 3 times week. can't run arrest calls. could probably find something underlying cut guess what... 30s 40s underlying issues detectable unless pointless invasive tests regularly.

My partner's risk factor birth control. Nearly cost eyesight.

Really hard hear people pretend due underlying issues rare sacrifice beers someone's sacrificing lives. 

So care underlying factors Again, US reporting correctly. entire system air classifications infections, deaths etc. politicized

Edit: many countries reporting practices, heavily politicize. Us top first world countries might fun play scientist make theories, has...Literally backing evidence. Governor death sentence  would also assume speed approve would depend trial success. Seems likely they'd speed process overwhelming evidence phase 3 successful (fingers crossed). whole debacle time tell.... Positives going month now. don’t see increase deaths week it’s really time end narrative covid getting worse.

And end lockdowns good. part. 

That setup hundreds millions help struggling media outlets, get grant verified ""fake news"", committee appointed government.  Worldometer us 3 million now. devil want devil knows he's going get. bother getting tested unless symptoms. wear mask. Yes good! Perhaps younger population testing positive bring overall rate quite bit. I'm sure treatment gotten better too. point we've avoided completely overwhelming medical resources (hope say month). Mr DeSantis says it’s stabilized...like wtf Flatten Curve* (by reaching theoretical upper limit infection rate) Canada Mexico meet RemindMe! 2 weeks I'm really sure objection is. I'm late 30s I'm healthy. live North America excellent sanitation health facilities, ability work home, financial means shield lot risk.

Lol, I'm sure U.S. around LONG me. think demise U.S., I've wasted time someone dense save! going add more, already proved waste anyones time lol Heath departements Scandinavian kingdoms must totally wrong

Yes relatives tell people regarding social distancing anymore since enforce masks supermarkets (and places) Germany. So, anecdotal, people get wrong feeling safety mask. wonder anti-mast people know look crazy. Screaming masks work - like God came told them. last 100 years medical science goes away want wear mask. Rant off.  Good, called scholar responsible suspect deaths start rise sharply mid-late July peak time August. 

That’s assuming lockdown July – otherwise deaths cases continue rise exponentially pandemic burns out. Buckees yesterday duty cop working security mask around neck. would $225 fine anyone enforcing law. elite families know what’s up. It’s community college kids figure stupidly dangerous experiment Fall. Problem solved! /s also tested positive Jr. caught it, Justin Trudeau didn’t hold back punches. love stupidified, scared, guilty looks faces. Upvote this. It’s already stressful job. Don’t need ICU bed alcohol poisoning gets ya first. French Canadians arent forced anything. free leave, won't. Instead rest us listen belly aching every couple years separation despite disproportionate amount federal influence quebec holds vs share national population. Well first serology study fell bit short herd immunity 4% garbage tests China known ton false positives, I’m pretty confident weeks pretending like everything fine really able pump numbers next serology test announced today. think racism came from? emigrated Europe Right? would imply there’s ton underage kids bars. 

Which probably true. STM (montreal transit) enforcing soon, I've good hope things improve. Fuck yeah Justin. Considering Honda going triple pay Mexican factory workers rather moving factories US, Mexico better praise Donnie boy. Ohhhh realize that! Good know, I'll back op edit previous comment Even back then, Americans like, “yes, fuck us!” [things like claim antivaxxers ignorant probably done research subject avg person gets vaccinated. bring fact son received 23 different vaccines diseases come from? agree distrust science aspect distrust science conducted days. profits dependant outcomes data get skewed read many different ways. end day kid still going get vaccinated, however many practices testing vaccines think done way hide something. would love full trust safe sure done proper testing probably fence.

Yup, check Fort Detrick. Us refused investigation puts classified.

The worrying thing unclear government planning triple lockdown. testing isolation policy? bad America full dumbass ignorant belligerant selfish psuedoscience believing pieces dog shit many arent going get vaccine anyways. won’t be. aren’t even enough needles produce this.

rip uncle juan. Yes, basically willful stupidity. There's reason reasonably level-headed person *not* want know source infection communal pattern, spread stemmed. claim paranoid government tracking them. refuse wear masks cover faces public. yeah, makes sense. far 90% see wearing masks. idiots, get stares others LOL seem like reasonable numbers.

I think early study saying aerosol ~6 hour half-life lab; real world probably closer 2 hours. staying 6ft even better 20ft away people outdoors though probably much worry about. would imagine indoor areas poor HVAC circulating air spread occurring.

Then I'm pretty convinced picked COVID weeks ago working close someone outdoors job (was wearing high quality mask sun glasses). severe pink eye along mild cold symptoms, apparently common symptom COVID Canada recommending people get tested pink eye. eye protection probably must also contain spread. *concerned Tampa local* it’s getting bad y’all, dumb shit won’t wear masks.

Meanwhile, state/country logged record numbers locale hospitals run ICU beds. Hopefully we’ll follow...At point. go, Toronto! know people can't get vaccinated, right? That's point herd immunity. think lot people increasingly every year.

Also path ""go community college first transfer"" becoming increasingly harder demand high community college cannot accept people either limits credits per person. be. remember deaths lag detection 20 days.

the big new-cases runup second wave started June 12 .. 3 weeks ago. expect death rate move soon. believe story true. Everyone knows, can't die coronavirus unless 65. probably hanging 5G wireless tower installed Bill Gates. MAGA. people voting factual account, acting like KARENS. Facts enemy. Flu deadly changes *nothing* CV. Microbes really nasty human body quit acting like COVID-19 legit topic anything else cause hundreds deaths. Nothing nefarious, think. shamming them. That's understood comment. came say thing Man poor guyNick Cordero passed away. guy hell battling covid... 24 Hour Cable News Cycle created 1980s specifically decided go entertainment informativeness. quite correct. animal passing ironically study viruses create pandemics. lab source live animals? 

Do buy animals wet market street? one epicenter pandemic?

It hard imagine technician researcher worked viral animal passing became infected, symptomatic, went purchase live animals market infected someone works full time. Ugh! This! broke tooth popcorn kernel even though brush twice, floss, etc. seriously started crying last place want go right dentist. I’ve googling night see somehow temporarily avoid another year go cases still relatively low PA! feel sick thinking make decision. seemed especially bad year neighborhood. mind occasional fireworks lasted untill 1 2 am. Yeh I'm sarcastic. I've seen people calling seasonal flu. crazy. Yeah realize 50% us drink alone Look armchair biochemists specialties vaccination here.

Its cringy sad. Sit back, wear mask, let experts jobs. *report* 250 deaths celebrate reported 250 deaths. TIL Sunshine State worlds largest covid colony seem mind label. Hell, think might even derive perverse pride it. Yeah - New Florida looks things said done..... stupid political story I've noticed reddit, pretty much every public forum people comment, people like actual critical thinking skills insight saying something reasonable get downvoted. Idiocracy. idea point trying convey. 

Deaths would go hospitals overrun. true. mean go capacity. Places like NYC ""run beds"" still 17k deaths.


I speaking Texas. hospital capacity currently fine. Dallas hospitals rejected Mayors request start building surge. Said need it.


Houston's network said dealing covid outbreak quote ""unnecessary panic"" capacity issues.

Texas whole 13k beds ready go. know surge capacity 13k empty. number mostly flat. fact actually increase ie actually ready available hospital beds last week. Science: want know truth, shoudn't let research it!

'Merica: suddenly interested

Science: shit! look, nevermind, mean, forget said anything. guess, legal team come hesus talk them. IANAL, I'm guessing there's massive class action liability they'd risk programming chill major way. husband made go back work &amp; state, one wears masks. immunocompromised, terrifies us.

He works factory average temperature 110°-115°F 80% humidity time due nature work. coworkers go bars, restaurants, casinos, etc., take precautions well. work cannot social distance &amp; take real precautions way well.

We tried several masks,but one hot becomes dizzy &amp; feels like going pass out. quote him, ""It feels like option heat stroke Covid-19.""

We using mask one thin later silk outside &amp; one thin later cotton inside wire bridge nose. husband desperately looking way take precautions work cause become ill heat. Sadly, cannot wear face shield requirements job, makes vision foggy. tried wrack brain, cannot think anything.

Does anyone know anything could use protect works cause issues heat/humidity? would appreciate much. people recover fine. serious virus infection appears percentage population survives long term damage body.

You idea ""most people recover fine"". data suggest that, making assumption. 


The data victims SARS people recover fine. data asymptomatic passengers cruise ship indicated ""recover fine"". 


The fact need data. limited data positive.

There data indicates ""most people recover fine"", that's hope everybody planet, that's shown via limited post-recovery studies. Oh, turn tables turn tables. Im sorry dont trust college requiring I’m completely shocked appalled others think us following story knew going happen. Poor guy, could never catch break. virus sapped strength, every lung infection kept pummeling more. 4% represents least 50 years since divergence, given mutation rate. Doesnt say death rate lower point, feel like COVID-19 pretty much exposing society's dumbest people. Selfish, too. anything would prevent factory going faster. requires people machines assemble factory. Asking what? need pay 100s billions police protect us cant spend money teachers Healthcare Warm weather doenst hasnt killed virus, Im sure saw information know running rampant world regardless seasonality.. city fireworks only. went spot watch fireworks, always go. never crowded. seemed even less crowded year. one near each. Also, fireworks lasted maybe 15 minutes. surprisingly short. festivities cancelled. he's going run country like business! need someone understands business office, another corrupt politician! problem lot doctors taking patients unless emergency. Like regular dentist check ups obgyn appointments accepted moment. called doctors office day message said COVID related stay line, emergency call 911. think issue fear issue access unfortunately. Poor guy catch break. RIP

Also crazy think long ago Sept 11 (19 years) - almost long time period two world wars (less start WWII 1937 Japan invaded China) Jesus fuck DOH reports WA Thanks poop-machines think you’re something. Cases higher ever US deaths continue drop. happening world, US. around 5K deaths per day back March, it’s steadily around couple hundred day across country. feeling immune response body mutated strain cause systemic overwhelming reaction previous strain. new strain seems like bad flu. bad news. Every day.

My doctor thinks SSRIs gonna solve depression problem......

NO....dammit - GOOD NEWS will. hope right too, results disappointing far.

I always envied Asian cultures value mask wearing. thought wearing masks this, now, seemed weird.

Now know pisses idiots, might pick habit good long covid! It’s Texas.

Here New Jersey people pouring beaches within inches trying get close high tide line possible. Hundreds people lined row

Who cares social distancing. Gotta right front Nope WRONG still lockdown point, saying ""would make difference wife governor?"" Isnt abuse power???? Wow, disgusting. would done moron, jesus christ. mean? see u/Orsty correct incompetent government. even trump anymore. 90% useless. problem, man thanks, we’re middle shit show. safe. wonder new ventilator procedures would caused fare better? put vent pretty quickly trying avoid long possible.  Men allowed ride families, think. women children car, would appropriate Gratz them. long quarantine. Let come in. it’s bad disease. real... They’ve TJ Maxx discount stores long time, always huge sales everything. I’m really digging mask fashion accessory. Mine took 8 days recent influx positive cases hit. 78 suffered lot health issues. Brain surgery last fall, hospitalized couple months surgery. Teachers need email administration (CC union spouse/loved-ones) express extreme concern forced teach in-person year. Tell highly recommend distance learning utilized. ignored, event die, spouse almost certainly solid claim sue district, possibly state, forcing spouse work dangerous environment. get it. Doctors nurses important.

So teachers (I would think teacher would understand this).

Even remote learning practical (which really given number workers rely schools care kids go work), pretty well proven remote learning simply substitute in-class instruction. Even good students amount content learned fraction in-class rates attendance abysmal.

I'll certainly agree state's health care system verge failure there's good case suspending classes 2 weeks (or however long takes state get past that), certainly make case suspending education nationwide many months going wait vaccine. people bitching NHL choosing Toronto playoff hub need see I’m glad northerly neighbors well! Without experts, would never known thing. Well, actually think EVERYONE wore masks, we’d able re-open lot businesses. Bars restaurants would tricky can’t wear mask eat. activities would much safer people refuse wear mask think makes look silly, POTUS told to. takes hell lot show 8 times week anyone loves jump ""healthy, athletic people end fine"" wagon way past point.

the 7-day moving average's first peak 32k new cases per day. second wave shot past point June 24. 

the current rate 49k new/day. Many strip clubs open - zero chance one.  Misspelled “Iron Man”. multiple candidates late stage trials six months. That's never happened before. 

HIV fair comparison, mutates frequently natural immunity.

Of course ready yet, promising candidates we're good spot going forward. That's curious.  think calculation uses wrong number.

The mortality rate calculated number deaths divided total number cases.

The total number cases.  That's used. used number confirmed cases.  saying everyone tested? 

If use real numbers (by antibody testing wide scale) see case load 20 100 times number using.  official death rate much closer 0.2% - believe me. Look yourself.  

I'm really concerned many people like duped misleading maths. outside wearing masks? headlines appeal low information sort. 

Why won’t CDC separate active viral tests, antibody tests(that test whole corona virus family) untested ‘probable cases’

Smells like fraud pump numbers. transparency would prove otherwise. IDK lot really dumb people college. sure pick wrong major? also mine rescue emt, wouldn’t again. CDC, heath authorities/figures. don’t know him. Hadn’t heard til COVID-19. - fought hard fought hard. cried hugging dog ten minutes. got snotty dog fur stick face took shower cried more. hurts bad. Shit like rights eroded. America hiding lot shit honest lol got lotsa cool stuff back want seeing! Thank you! responsible unfettered spread virus anybody. needs form punitive punishment outlets people spread misinformation based solely politics. misinformation however lethal. Richmond Hill well. never struck odd seeing people wear masks Asian community would wear often, covid even thing. Damn. Rest peace, Nick. May wife child heal strong. Mexico better... amount globalization new developments/industrial areas made, there's higher chance zoonotic events. 

It's still unlikely doubt going 100 years another event like happens. r/NoShitSherlock Looks like type person anybody would avoid asshat. Meanwhile Florida infecting 10,000 day median age 37 way! biased braindead CNN idiot thinks look foolish?
Unheard of. Lol anti maskers pay trying help?

I mean know wasnt imagine OP spending whole life trying find purpose somehow it? Wanted update: Nick Cordero passed away earlier today age 41. survived wife Amanda son Elvis. 

This confirmed wife's Instagram post. Interesting, makes sense. wasn’t sure covid medication receiving hospital. Thank kind schooling people learn type stuff. come educated background US *never* information access courses studies/jobs like these. fascinating work lung transplant weak. Rather expected would need transplant stronger. That's said. Awesome don’t friends I’ll make sure former keep arguing points possible story shows, unlikely certainly widespread problem. Covid cause blood clots certain cases, ventilator (immobile) hospital setting weeks/months lead clots. someone tons clots, amputation might necessary assume happened him.

Basically, everything could go wrong went wrong guy. majority cases drastic, reminder take seriously. cautious mindful it, stress panic. Please interview people Florida beach now, think virus.  assume, sorry. sadistic say old people brunt total deaths, grim reality.

It's like 50 minicountries us response virus, fascinating though sad see time, many people resources mismanaged, well, could've foreseen anyways. Yikes! Honestly, surprised started lab US projection China starting Trump spouts. “As June 12, 2020, age-adjusted hospitalization rates highest among non-Hispanic American Indian Alaska Native non-Hispanic black persons, followed Hispanic Latino G3 people refuse take vaccine. guarantee it. There’ll 2 week lag least... anyone lost leg due COVID-19?

Yeah, guy named Nick Cordero did. 🤦‍♀️ Help here... mean mice became immunocompromised general fighting live virus?

ELI5 please. think consensus yet, they've found far pangolins close enough match. feel like living fall Empire. Future generations reading 2020 way read pivotal moments fall Roman Empire Nah bro, worked underground surface mining driller/ blaster. back day could get certified without much hassle. Good times. Well doesn’t really work way group friends everyone either lazy cant asked, someone says they’re true friends well fuck im also lazy one friends left social media would distance much pain ass is. Guess every group different opinions No, not. Donald Trump could day event wearing make tomorrow every Trumplican would believe Trump wearing masks since day one. Thank school inculcating critical thinking growing up. read. dont know say man.....  war North South become Right Left. instructive *everyone*? course not. stop person fence going party, make think wearing mask, etc.?

Even made one person much safer, alone could prevent infection many, many people. Oh i'm continuing it. worries. called red state resurgence. Ha!! Yes, would similar next step Pfizer’s 4 candidate vaccines. Leave? return home.  tried mask vent it? wouldn’t prevent infecting others, would protect coworkers... Yes! However like US Mexico large places level outbreak, like within US. DVT.... 

Check r/Covid19positive , ton stories ""thick blood"" 4 month cases .... Bahahahahah really think single holiday cause this, especially since many holidays really move needle. much likely due opening soon country.

With many holidays much incubation period cam vary by, basically always find one holiday kinda ""fits"" rise cases. pinnacle anti-racism supposed color-blind? color supposed matter? not, we're talking race reparations, anti-racism.

I many things say reply. believe thing institutionalized racism, many things not. Specifically, non-equal outcome used sole determinant institutionalized racism, would silly.

But that's put aside whether things institutionalized racism second... say things indeed institutionalized racism. point (in various proposed fixes) say ""institutionalized racism ended equality?"" answer ""we tell equality outcomes everything completely equal"" think terrible indicator use, completely absolves person's identity action beyond racial identity. 

However, open suggestions. perhaps might know better way. speculation Houston strain virulent normal strain. I’m way. I’m dark sheet plywood dirt trying whatever barbell ground. Dear god think 2020 would come this. fought admirable fight. wife seems like sweetheart. I'm sad hear this. no. no. no! 

Vegas dont get limited amount hospitals way take huge spike hospitalizations? Theres way! 

Aw Man....This looks bad... ""wear mask"" anything anything? People going get there's vaccine, least year away. There's chance convincing people wear mask times long. Zero point zero.

It's going happen, accept hope high saving roll. well obviously controlling virus spreads crucial. UIUC apparently developed saliva based testing planning students install app notify random get tested throughout semester also give test results. hope test actually work people aren’t wearing masks lazy/overweight people aren’t political issue, they’re feel like can’t breath get irritated break mask.

That's I've seen. ridiculous, people vulnerable seem awareness! Something doesnt seem get brought often ""why can't us universal healthcare like Canada"" discussion too! neighbors around family wore masks.  Wtf 😥 Congratulations Canada! sensible responsible people. world needs countries like Canada Germany. US seriously trouble happens. You’re also assuming every American citizen every person around world going take vaccine proves work. idea mild strain spurns good evidence really. 

The far likely scenario nursing homes protected (make 50% deaths), older people taking better precautions, people outside mucosal immunity stronger lower chances infection becoming severe, better treatments.

We know 1 week. deaths Texas, Arizona, Florida, South Carolina rising rapidly things clearly shifted major way. never tested positive Covid don’t think state first masks cops store enforcing it. dont think theres fines true law though. Everyone seems pretty good wearing masks though. No, can't. anecdotal absolute best. dont think know argument is. reasserting probably already knows best treatment covid patients known, sometimes ventilators harm good. accepted fact. sure knows this, attempting argue maybe came across way hard fully express forums this. Honestly you’re sick, you’re better home. symptoms treat like definitely covid self isolate, minor fever/cough feel pretty good, you’re putting risk going around people DEFINITELY could cold. worse.

Ah, happened TV needs dealt with. Well, pretty flat prior holiday weekend - see next couple weeks (sorry guy).  Marin County, 86 cases per 100K population, already 'tipping point' (terminology used Harvard) means stay home order required curb spread. rest Bay area looking okay, now. Southern California, hand, pretty bad shape, especially Imperial County think said covered early June bills kicked that? Even still, they’ll astronomical. Surely claiming sick American hombres trying get Canada safe? * pro-life movement correct?

* sources recommend others determine masks helpful effective not? Michiganders, please tip hats Governor standing tall amidst profound idiocy people. Sure, 3 imported cases, 1 domestic Beijing. Beijing outbreak nearly done thanks hard work. Yet record low deaths...... also refused say Trump wrong, spun BS  Ok that's fair. mean, worst case scenario sort rushed unproven treatment modality death.

In 2003, coronavirus China, SARS, spread Canada via woman contracting virus Metropole Hotel Hong Kong returning Canada air. spread son healthcare workers hospital stayed. woman son died total, 330 sick 44 died Canada. this, despite fact healthcare managed provinces, public health federal responsibility (i.e. things get bad infectious disease, Federal government takes over).

The reasons able better:

- framework federal response health crisis United States, governors, much like President, still care political differences crisis. hand, Canada's politicians managed set aside differences federal, provincial territorial governments worked together close country (internally) international agreement US Canada reached shut border days later.

- Universal single-payer healthcare system Canada. long citizen, permanent resident work permit holder legally present Province Territory least 150 days calendar year, eligible Health Insurance card covers medical care--we cover dental, vision prescription medications (medications dependent province, Ontario, cover unless 25 65 welfare disability benefits). America, health insurance guaranteed people 18 65 (or, lot cases, people making less 100% poverty line via Medicaid, states this).

The irony pandemic, caused millions Americans lose jobs--and jobs still come back. 20 million lost, less 10 million came back may lost COVID-19 spins control. Now, 50% Americans depend employer get coverage. So, circular logic, chicken-and-the-egg problem will:

Lose job due pandemic longer employer-sponsored health insurance get sick COVID-19 show symptoms getting disease avoid going hospital due fear medical bills...

- Generally, Canada's general public seems acutely aware consequences COVID-19 memories SARS current situation US. mean, Canadians would look US say: See going there? relax regulations/open borders, end like them! all, past weeks, new cases US 100 times new cases Canada despite 8.7 times population. peak, US cases increasing 54 000 per day (equivalent 6 200 Canada) Canada's worst day reported 2 700 new cases.

A startling statistic profound implications way we’ve managed coronavirus pandemic.


I blame rejecting. minute get job strike travel deal, Germany bound am. list while. :) Population 1.3 billion (more entire Western world) slightly deaths New Jersey.

Comparing countries based absolute numbers saying infections ""hardest hit"" ridiculous thing do. logic, San Marino got lightly. Household transmisson rates 10% 30% , since guys family members significantly lower, look Table 3 research data household secondary attack rates. Chances good infected, stay apart, room unless nessecary keep interactions brief, communicate texting instead talking, consider keeping windows room open help maintain fresh airflow. Good luck take care Making hard working teenager cry hope coustomers Karen themselves. Yeah, course big corporation take sort risk. guys number them. seems like lot low-level employees we're really stressed upset anything. order manager companies, 9 times 10 piece shit. 3 weeks  Sure go ahead milk cookies There's major pushback Chicagoland. People downright adamant kids wear masks. great many claim homeschool kids forced mask (...just like people claim move Canada choice president win. Never happens.) school administration basically said wear masks students * * wear masks, we're going force issue don't. We're screwed. another case presidency secured electoral college losing popular vote around 3 million Clinton. Third time history. American history lesson explain surgical process Trump campaign. questionable way late that. We're fucked collective stubbornness refusal accept reality. one people basically says “how’s racist, they’re even black” It’s time shut down, implement inclusive federal mask ordinance, pay every American UBI, implement strict social distancing Gods sake, federal top educational program debunk disinformation get control virus! solution. continue half ass measures, it’s going get worse! never going magically disappear! It’s time Trump incapable anything impotent response given far, it’s time initiate 25th amendment! infuriating- many people die? many? Florida seems like perfect Corona hotspot.. tons retirees Narrator: wasn’t. COVID intubation 
I follow state intubation. steady past 2 weeks except last 3 days (including today) usage increased 1% day. clean 30 hours still use them? certainly hope so, hockey awesome.

Maybe it’ll pick new fans starts again. really really hope does. millennials zoomers seem way open medicare pushing government healthcare similar countries. hope register vote make difference.... support staff? work community college support staff given choice. expected back campus, us, tomorrow. Texas, week last, 7 positive cases 4 different buildings, caused 1 building *partially* shut down. *minimal occupancy*.

Only doctor's note high risk employee prevent back tomorrow instead continuing work home. note, without defined expiration date bec asthma COPD exactly expire do, given expiration date dept vp wo weeks. beds left ICU means new ICU admissions. That's smart mention anything horrible/not horrible??? results tests earlier week likely, free public testing centers closed Friday weekend. There's millions people unemployed thanks shutdowns, willing help however trained provide basic care one disease need treat. throwing hands air saying ""it can't done"" helping anyone. 

Don't know chosen make personal insinuation alcohol consumption, I'm saying personally want go open bar. I'm saying social people (i.e. people browse subreddit) really want go nice environment drink alcohol group. went outside see happening already, explains many new cases young people catch parties. Opening bars allows thousands establishments haemorraging money laying hundreds thousands people least begin recoup lost earnings. tell you, month ago one 10 people testing positive. Today, one four,"" **Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner told CBS ""The number people getting sick going hospitals exponentially increased. number people ICU beds exponentially increased. fact, get hands around virus quickly, two weeks hospital system could serious, serious time, President Trump said Saturday that, cases increasing, administration made ""a lot progress"" slowing spread virus. **He blamed increase cases increase testing**, *which experts argue incorrect evaluation spread* Oh bummer 😕 Never tried it. imagine lots men sweat pants lying couch curtains drawn, spraying stuff directly throats.  did... it’s federal guidelines things like masks. NJ much protect citizens states don’t follow suite  always thought Hillary Duff one okay ones move. Yeah, agitated person receives almost 0 consequences usually step back line talk cops 5 mins again. People even get arrested things think Constitutional rights, thinking dismissed, even win harassment charge. think American society dug deep mask thing. Plus many areas threat enforcement. employee cops even come. I'm definitely going wait see, state way aggressively stupid thought months ago. complications may listed cause death rather COVID-19,” Woolf adds university statement.

They ruled cooking books. ever dumbfounded things stare screen 2 minutes afterwards? think may doubted people’s willingness compassionate enough leave good ones medical force supply less effective ones. yeh fallout lie - spread due one wearing rampant distrust “Big Science” - simply disastrous. heard somewhere live it. Plus right visit Michigan quarentine testing mask. wait Trump retweet Nursing Homes &amp; Assisted Living Facilities Account 65% COVID-19 Deaths

A startling statistic profound implications way we’ve managed coronavirus pandemic. No, protect others. Hence anti maskers attempted murder charges. Yeh never happened. I'm expert bad Hillary made Americans vote trump? ever lesser two evils? man severely qualified job, become apparent lately. really understand ever elected. like UK voting Boris Joh................oh fuck. happened too. world's mess. home state ""there things important living"" politician? Making teenager working hard..Make American cry again. mean ones american law? R/onejoke hospitals overflow would right, soon triage starts preventing people admitted hospital older generations going freak out. lockdown late itll happen. use mouth wash days Thats also horrible? think thats horrible? “most testing world” false statistic though. 

We’re 3rd largest population 1st infections deaths. conducted tests thus far. 

We near testing capacity we
need know we’re against, exists, - haven’t seen nationwide plan get us there. That’s stat matters. 

This isn’t social competition look better France. Either test enough know what’s happening country, don’t. 

Agreed wait tests acceptable either. friend got tested 8 weeks ago - hasn’t heard back. That’s worse useless. 

Agreed repeated subsidized antibody tests also necessary. think stupid people dying. stupid people ones killing. reasons news stories young people dying mostly rare. virus killing young people frequently sudden roommate got sick recently. Looks like COVID, know results ten days.

That seems like really long time. state in? Nursing Homes &amp; Assisted Living Facilities Account 65% COVID-19 Deaths

A startling statistic profound implications way we’ve managed coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus isn’t helping anything Florida rest country, July 4th single worst day accidents nationwide based five-year trends. would safe assume lot ICU hospital space due traffic accidents, water accidents (it FL), alcohol incidents, yeah probably fireworks. COVID patients course makes harder hospital capacity, would wrong assume everybody coming emergency room July 4th holiday weekend coronavirus. Maskholes! That’s honestly kinda good husband went cleaning week ago thing (in Canada). Going cancel mine end month due sensitivity without fancy stuff oral sedation minimum pointless painful affair. also worried girlfriend times two, presumably get house going make wear mask 24/7 house? Uni work setting Zoom rooms professor lecture room required materials equipment alone TA. Multiple cameras place capture everything. Sanitized use. prefer information allows understand actions consequences develop proper behaviors respect creature never seen earth could kill conditions wrong. word you’re looking stupid. fix ignorance seeking knowledge, stupid people make decisions without seeking new sources information. People don’t wear masks stupid. FYI, ""led"" right spelling context comment. Also, agree said. Everyone bored lockdown social distancing, they're going flock bars pubs large numbers. That's going exponentially increase spread. One can't expect people self-police. may physical wall, I’d like think line Imaginary another 6-12 months. 

No Americans, trucks dual citizens. Gotcha. strongest ""anti-mask"" group police themselves. sheriff's departments refused enforced COVID orders, regular beat cops wear masks. month two school back massive outbreaks half teachers leave quarantine even hospital dead, what? We're right back remote learning accomplish? places already shortage substitutes anyway, think they're gonna clamoring come *that* situation substitute pay?

Think back teachers high school. I'm fit young man, many coworkers 50+, overweight obese, preexisting conditions. I'm one biggest hotspot cities country. We're scheduled bring students back exactly 4 weeks tomorrow.

There absolutely way cramming 2,000 students staff campus regular basis result anything massive outbreak shutting back little weeks. 60+ underlying condition? hoax. watching fox news said florida fine. wish joke said less 2hrs ago. hope ppl wise ignore politics ot comes something care it. I've biking, trying avoid going places. couple screws fell pedals, get couple bike shop. :( *wish* knew actual risk percent job right now. probably damn high, stay home worth risking life over. really hard, without concrete numbers, overcome financial risk, social pressures, possibility I'm overly cautious, quit anyway. volunteer ICU without mask non medical things like emptying bed pans, housekeeping etc. know since afraid things. What? ton more. coordinated worked foreign governments provincial leaders secure ppe testing supplies. launched CERB created safety net allow people stay home (and actually helpful, unlike $1,200 joke US people still waiting for). sent army lockdown LTCHs (far late, horrific happened, thats covid related). 

I think honestly confused healthcare run Canada. Shouldn’t sharp jump deaths soon coincides sharp rise cases ? Shhh, need tourist money. Meaning exactly? Chinese-Americans complaints attacked US? Oh ok see, must’ve confused native language. read right? alcohol? none sold? people bring own? Get free? don’t vaccine common cold?

maybe coronaviruses cause like 20% common cold. based that, assume hard much spread plus ever heard someone dying cold, like they're now?

don't get wrong, agree chance, vaccine vaccine time. even greater chance will, whole world working it. Ah Newport! Beautiful there. Hopefully state dicks don’t crash local healthcare system! know people long term serious health effects flu RSV every type virus? AIDS comes mind. major problem infections nursing homes, figuring deal better now. NY, while, requiring nursing homes take COVID patients sick enough stay hospital (so could open beds sicker patients) ended spreading virus nursing homes killing people. rescinded order. don’t know means, gets lot financial help parents stay home mom. first 16 hasn’t ever job Someone likely procreated horrid creature too...::barf:: Short story: electoral college created give equal weight rural areas (large swaths US). Otherwise big cities would always dominate 2 party system work. That's incredibly concise explanation gist. Nowadays nothing road map campaign spending swing states. elections usually decided states. Electoral votes winning certain states much important votes would require intelligent patients. Let's face , doctors/cabbies/store owners saying wear whatever want politicians said so. customers, unless want get threatened physically loose business competition, makes least waves short term.

Most people seem believe masks dumb unnecessary. want money, best act like agree them. Trying make $$$$ areas switched type tests. self administrated nasal test common ""brain tickle"" nasopharyngeal test generate false negatives (i.e.fail detect infection), concentration virus body low, nasal test significantly less accurate nasopharyngeal test. get negative result, aware rule infection.

I also idea do. go work tomorrow, don’t even know go getting test 

Boston reference. feels like twilight zone much people living normal lives, that's sure. 6th friend mine works service industry came symptoms today--dry cough, fever, muscle aches--so might want tell get tested. call dumbass, lol. also wrong:

"" genetic reversal pathogen virulent form takes considerable time (at least 12 months) affect person originally vaccinated. vaccine-derived attenuated virus normally excreted vaccinated people limited period.

The Bad News. We're soooooooo screwed guys.  would 100% year off, especially age vast information MOOCs. surprised paid even free MOOCs better quality hastily put together university course. Hell hire tutor, still much less tuition.

Same thought process public relation tactics going exact opposite direction empowering anti-mask. Like snuffing fire suppressing allowing fire grow adding fuel. face looks hot mess. I've heard US. assume worldwide. Younger people getting infected, better treatments now. 

Also keep testing mind, though April mid May Florida testing 10-20k people day, they're consistently testing people straight hate told do, automatically opposite prove can't told do. vaccine ready end year, it'll easily take another year get enough doses everyone manufactured distributed.

So Sundays numbers days prior missing something? haha point view relies assumption 100% people get infected, objectively going happen.

Your argument would lot stronger acknowledged this. Would able prescribe sort ointment/salve/balm/cream sick burn laid /u/Tychoanaut? Sabotages herd immunity, unless vaccine works really long time, wont know long immunity lasts Guess that’s we’ve getting less calls accent. I'd rather outright die live health consequences debt it.

America, fuck yeah. Well visit prison! Yeah, called Triage. actually save person?

Can equipment better used person actually save?

Do want doctor make call? Darn I’m curious said lol Fucking LOL chance. new profs exist ensure continued employment admin many avoid nobody learned lesson. places strong bar cultures, people spend lot time indoors air-conditioning time year. right. don’t count flu deaths way. fact, barely count flu deaths all. flu deaths mostly estimates. significantly less accurate COVID-19 deaths. good arguing point look flu deaths calculated. forget benefit companies want use data sway electorate. Good answer would me. free beds mean optimum strategy use them! Work mind. Break asshats bad really is. Bombard messages everywhere selfishness get people killed. 

Maintain stricter regulations lot Americans need spoonfed good bad. 
 

Keep masks mandatory, change rules people follow rules given ticket pay fines penalities.

I really think drinking crowded bars risk tennis match. 

I hope France stays control, telling truth bars opened ""packed,""....well, people epidemiologists saying that's *terrible* idea. 3 drinks least. ""We'll see what's left throw couple trillion stock market"" That’s unkind way point spelling mistake old boy! experts still haven’t determined whether virus airborne long survives hard surface? think I've seen cancer ever given reason here. people think they're ugly they're fairly upfront reason. people claim they're noisy bad migratory birds. loony people claim cause health problems, mainstream. live Dallas, many people thinking project fear. Since death spikes whole hospital thing overblown apparently. People looking forward sending kids back school, barely anyone accepts might happen. Misleading jobs numbers?! way. thanks advice, luckily closed don’t think problem take advice case happens /shrug Read article Stew. pretty cut dry. Half Con &amp; Corp propaganda masks infringement personal rights, half Con &amp; Corp propaganda prohibition gathering infringement religious rights gather worship.

I'm surprised people know this, pretty much reflex certain factions label stuff dislike unpatriotic irreligious point. pneumonia deaths waaaay remember mosques burning brown stores (because can't tell difference) vandalized. Congrats! must scary, baby magic comes it. hope recovering well baby healthy. There's gonna difference states... huge difference, real borders stop people spreading across lines. Diabetes typically kill quickly. type 2 diabetic misses months insulin, result usually death... Unless mixed Covid. That's fantastic.  

Must nice governor that's nearing century mark. Idk anywhere else least FL, one even enforcing new mask order. people wearing one holding people wear accountable. Sadly IMO there's way would enforce social distancing beaches. Yeah i've times got results two weeks later even later tests. can't imagine keeping track many tests. best have. know nerve racking, hang there. Canadians respect communities wear mask show respect. Theres plenty things canadians fight politically. Masks one them. Well then... realistically could started? question didn’t come bat? Hey, bring patients Palms Pasadena time.

There 2 groups people aren’t wearing masks. thing common *entitlement*.

The first group right-winger “freedom costs” people.

The second, common group (at least area), people don’t want wear mask. wear around neck, wear 2 seconds take off, wear mouth nose, etc. it’s overweight lazy people Cases / day matter extent result hospitalizations. lockdowns rollbacks NY, states right track. take prediction bank Torontonian here!

Monday report gets whatever reported morning since Friday morning. see difference number gets smaller tomorrow. sad ""used it"". yeah, ridiculous people think Sámi can't higher education! definitely something I've noticed Nordics well: widespread stereotyping allow complexity Sámi people. :/ people a-holes who'd argue violence nurses teachers, exploded number last 10-15 years, ""part job"" ""they knew signed for"".

Arrogant pricks zero empathy others, sometimes even family.  interestingly, lot respiratory viruses trigger wheezing asthmatics, none asthmatic COVID19 patients I've treated actually get typical asthma type breathing. COVID19 basically looks everyone else's comes lungs-a horrible cough feeling like can't breathe.

As whether asthmatics higher risk think probably need see larger datasets really know. thought younger asthmatics seemed needing hospitalization oxygen often, sample size small really possible draw real conclusions since also lots healthy young people got super sick. know sure COVID19 really seem trigger asthma attacks. US needs officials taking seriously. can’t believe pandemic made something political. Toronto lot worse parts Canada. Thankfully, mayor (John Tory) mandated masks. almost factors known. think biggest unknown wide spread beyond tested. 40% nyc positive rate days correlate arizona 25% florida 15% etc airborne, makes masks even pointless last time flu know of, really ill 2 weeks. Please regale us many examples left-based violence it’s worse right wing. No, hospitals lowest levels they've since beginning pandemic. see surge start, we're equipped handle it.

For example, county reported 10 new cases, daily highs hundreds, 136 (including probable cases yet confirmed) cases whole state daily highs thousands. went 2 days without deaths, promising sign. also realized needs revise death toll- double counting recent ones way local areas report meaning actually may inflating recent deaths trying catch all.

My local hospital currently 10 cases- nearly 100 peak, 2 cases icu, possibly 2 quite now. Mass general (the worst affected hospital) 500 cases- 66 cases treated, less 10 icu.

The state good shape, short deal surge rollback starts get intense. reopening threatens profits corporations... Possible false positives. Fhm quality assesment antibody tests week 26, give guidance commercially available tests acceptable quality.

So 

1. Positive test.
2. assymptomatic.

You contact whoever test find one good ones.

And get retested. Yes, yes is. /s see that, thanks clarifying. Sweden far highest death rate?

It’s coincidence racial justice become hot topic pandemic. Black, hispanic, native people left die heritage inequality. he's completely different scale anecdotal evidence. news? 100,000 people died. people life actually really care. always discretion individual. Heard lot though. I'm part medical community.

And I'm telling really inadequate data. medical community telling enough data.

What conformation bias

There limited studies examine mild illness children warrant hospitalization.

With said, horse race. I'm parent. think easy decision. Hospital numbers support Case numbers point. 

It's impossible though know death rates number factors politics. First, doctors better protocols, second, younger people infected. may still come hospital owing thousands generally dying. 

The good news Northeast cautiously opening economic figures looking much better. California get act together high stock market valuations might almost reasonable. Given prevailing “it harms old people” attitude coupled w reticence wearing masks, inevitable heading Italian/NY problem many places US. actions dictate results Totally warranted. answered question NY (and cdc) criteria reopening hospital capacity. Decline total new hospitalization, well deaths, 14day trailing basis cap threshold new hospitalizations shorter period. Hospitial/ICU capacity (as noted). Testing contact trace worker capacity. still review data make sure signs okay.

The states problems follow approach (basically ignored CDC guidelines rush opening). people hate told do. feel flu. mother 1 lung COPD, use oxygen, able wear mask well.

Any healthy young person refuses wear mask read this. Popcorn time. claim ""CHARGE RICH!"" simple

It literally simple. Making 1% Wall Street pay fair share instead allowing pay literally nothing would fully cover universal healthcare some. classes person lockdown feel learned person. new teacher barely prepared teach person, online teaching really hurt teaching. saw weeks ago Coronavirus florida sub. widely reported pre-existing conditions, find became sick. hospital three months, plenty time find any. I'm last one arrive first leave. Whys everyone paid me!? No, whoever goes movie theaters incredibly stupid. Careful 03 generator. oxidize things like foams (carpet pads, furniture components) actually reduce indoor air quality properly ventilated. I've always wanted go World Poker Tour cruise. made decision back April. think month announced return spring break ridiculous. let Darwin take wheel I'm constantly making faces people mask. able find anyone Japan, cases heard of, prove positive result first get antibody test. want felt ""recovered"" (like 4 weeks after) I'd heard could donate plasma toward vaccine creation / treatment effort, told test exist yet. 

Also, around 4 months seems lot people already low antibodies point. Anyway, there's really point now, guess. People like believe it, see need prove satisfy neuroses. XD least make cash it! 6month old. lockdown greatest gift myself, wife daughter could ever asked for. pandemic even known would missed Yes unfortunately lose lose scenario.

My mom mother law teachers late 50s would susceptible covid-19... say school online looking entire lost year kids. 

The real option, mom believes, best online year hold kids back repeat next year. Ahh, autism gang spreads... according plan...


(Please joke keep kids safe dont want brains ruined something preventable) would surprised. Trump's comment bit crass stats CDC: \*7% total US deaths (as per CDC) persons underlying conditions. \*Greater 80% total deaths persons 65 years old Source: 

COVID ""harmless."" course, adverse symptoms people experience. However, likelihood death extremely low 65 years old underlying conditions. 

The CDC provide enough granularity public data calculate exact probability death &lt;65 yrs old underlying conditions. using basic probability principles: Probability Death &lt;65 x Probability death underlying conditions = 0.2 x 0.07 = 0.014 (1% chance).  Georgia State requiring either. They're following USG guidelines says they're recommended required. Bojack fans here?

There's scene late last season everybody's sitting around trying damage control Bojack's public relations. Diane says something like ""We plane parachutes plane, jumped out. two arguing parachutes stowed. they're gone. plane gone. We're hurtling towards ground right now.""

That's point US.

We supposed spend April May setting contact tracing isolation system nationwide. lockdown supposed buy us time do.

Problem 1: American lockdown wasn't, really. US never got 20K cases day.

Problem 2: even might enough, **if state federal departments made tracing isolation system**, didn't.

So, basically, US wrecked economy absolutely reason, significantly worse position response started. million people going die end year (feel free set reminder mock I'm wrong) economy significantly recover many people going (reasonably) afraid things involve outside house. definitely agree w ab media, hype everything ratings basic infection control measures inconvenient overreaction.

ignaz probably rolling grave right sees sort thing. Yeah, would post daily insta stories it. may saved story highlights. go Target Home depot stop shop . think minimum wage workor cleaning stuff?

People done antibody testing [in Sweden] week 26 may need retake test, especially positive result despite symptoms.

Tests done end June may show incorrect results, according Karin Tegmark Wisell, Head Department Public Health Authority.

- Since came recommendations performance tests week 26, may happen test takers made different assessment tests done now, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.

But everyone done test week 26 test again, mainly people got positive result even though symptoms, according Karin Tegmark Wisell.

- mainly positive result perhaps especially belong risk group. risk think disease therefore protection new corona virus even it, says.

If suspect test result correct, whether done quick test finger stick laboratory-based test blood sampling arm, contact test provider.

- ask person performed test meets recommendations made Public Health Authority, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.

Tests done week 26 tests done future show reliable results according Tegmark Wisell.

- developed recommendations intended support performers test support appropriate requirements tests offer see much better conditions conductor tests, concludes. Baker careful, I'll give that. appreciate holiday weekend, wish would given time see 4th damage.

The weather kinda sucked large chunk weekend, though, may helped us. Friday gloriously empty around me, enjoyed walking beach near live least amount people I've seen months. Found ton sea glass, too- waves kicking bit. if’s. unite. Hundreds thousands die. generation learn difference recession depression. 

Many Americans don’t deserve this, we’re also learn things brainwashed believing aren’t true. Life **not** fair **not** able anything set mind to. Love it. 

Had idiot thread telling would never working vaccine ""scientists trying make coronavirus vaccine DECADES!"".

I wish people basic understanding viruses vaccines work. I'm convinced sometimes Trump literally talk random scratch, send military bomb kill thousands innocent lives multiple cities, loyalists still vote him. brighter news sad say, many aging out, maybe replace younger generation. I'm personally New York, almost everyone hates city. hear wanting schools open nothing kids work. think understand year two period isn’t gonna negative broad scope kids education. think really enjoy lockdown, actually LOATHE commuting strict religion. You’re stretching try make point relevant reply. Oh good. “But President says go away!” dont undertand fight freedom. like fell ship, throw wheel scream ""catch wheel"", would like ""you going tell do, freedom! rather day free listen you!"" drown fighting freedom...

I dont understand dying virus fighting freedom. absoutelly reason die virus, even thing first place. weekend fucked up. Lots places observed holiday Friday. see dip Fri 7-10 days. Last week 3 weeks ago, feels like getting sooner sooner like watching car crash slow motion think there’s good chance we’ll get within 6 months, think it’s important aware possibility takes longer think want bullshit didnt get bailout money well? Man, Ive neuro problems since puberty. Chronic migraines tension headaches caused terrible body aches achey joints horrible horrible cramps diarrhea. 
Turns got backwards. IBD whole time gut problems causing stuff. 
Keep pursueing health. never know might hit something game changer. Ruh roh Fined exercising 1A rights? What's example denying delaying? Wtf It’s kinda nature select Almost guaranteed flu season plus covid-19 make mortality rates go up. average span infection death 18 days. ""Attention Carrefour staff, cleanup aisle Bayonne"" university super unconvincing/lethargic answers far. Also, since would majoring CS site practical experience thing, mind remkte classes. point, I’m done. took car shop get new transmission dropped car, idiot mechanic going vacation week. might corona car get back.........I’m hoping doesn’t get sick able finish it. Prevented altogether. know downvoted, right. think getting tattoo injected vaccine haha. little corona beer style crowne. father also COPD lives co-op constantly finding excuses leave unit fetch mail shared living spaces. He's also running quick errands grocery store..etc weekly basis. Thankfully live Kansas cases low incredibly stressful time immediate family literally beg stay home time.

I'm glad dad right thing putting risk burdening family stress. 

Dad somehow stumble upon comment, hope feel little guilt rethink next outing, want keep around long possible. Agreed. kids done great less socialization. We’ve bike riding going walks lately, haven’t able sit play kids they’re perfectly fine still. 
My daughter speech happened. continue helping best could home. child made much progress. It’s amazing. r/chodi ?  baffling random seems be.

Athletic, healthy 41 year-old dies, somehow 92 year-old grandma survived fine.  get vote leave UK fucking disrespectful dead, currently suffering suffer directly indirectly virus. Maybe far future emerge stronger think focus needs responding crisis hand, pretending everything magically turn ok. chuckled got extremely depressed American. Almost like hearing word aladeen. No, didn’t. knew infectious diseases follow Koch‘s postulates. even know whether cause microbe all, kind liquid. That’s called virus - Latin word “poison”.

Basically doctors 1930s “knew about” viruses sense physicists today know dark matter. What? mutated. also mutate withing single organism. broadcast update every copy FFS Actually exactly issue. caused nature, nature fix it. gotcha might want write original comment? fucking op asking people caught covid. Musician here, everyone trying get go play weekend. gig unless something changes. looking forward it. lot ""restaurants"" many people bars kind freaking out. sure do. keep turn gigs owners said establishments trying sue state reopen. wanna associated. Trying stay home hunker maybe get back comfortable work next month. feeling particular bar owner trying get go fund money like certain hair dresser town. Someone hair snazzy can't bad. single kids local friends. great paid getting chance play video games, adhering schedule, waking early, time train/work out, saving money gas. hate outdoors motivates run faster outside worked out. 

Great vacation far concerned. Yup, friend works Covid patients. sees hang weeks eventually die, sometimes longer. Also typically go second sick. That's one reason hospital capacity issue. people long time. Watch phase. Gyms good place -- many require masks work out. movie theaters people eating/drinking without mask. indoor dining/bars allowed, bets off. dangerous places.

Enclosed space + mask = virus spread. Guaranteed. Ah yes, meaningful change possible everything like caused big government. could forget? Yep, lots students smart enough know even in-person classes start fall they'll spend semester edge seat waiting things go online again. rate might well register online class community college, way know exactly getting.

I feel bad kids signed leases already.  Exactly point.

Both age groups disregard virus different reasons, people fight ""more right"". Lol? stopped working since lockdown, eating less. lost weight, lot weight muscle woke able respond yes questions moving eyes, even though told, know much actually knew end. Well, say locked hotel China served dog rat meat, I’d hope you’d feel same, beggars can’t choosers?

Why eat different animals eachother much cultural anything point. foreign workers limited access. hospitals problems foreign workers kept dormitories. completely read ""Third report people enjoying lockdown""

Only three? Nick Cordero's wife asked prayers positive thoughts throughout ICU stay. respect value religion source comfort, her, would really shake faith. prayers nothing; nothing went right husband. circle tight enough. man died LA 'friend' knowingly CV19 attended party. 

I swear, people believe entire industry shut give people long-awaited vacation instead forced close virus deadly wouldnt expect see it. American blinders on. Thank goodness spreading rural areas now, though. People think like deserve affected. definition ""lots"" using? 

Thousands people literally considered ""lots"" definition... Carnival booked first cruise allowed 3 months nothing within hours. record sales comeback, industry fine.  Honest question, vaccine supposed provide antibodies fight virus, correct?

If so, matter percentage population decides take it? example, mom who’s older takes don’t, problem? lot reason second wave 1918 flu worse everything World War I. soldiers milder version flu stayed trenches fight, sicker soldiers got sent home, spreading version flu widely around world. normal times, that's opposite works - sickest people stay home, milder illness likely ones about. Sweden lockdown caused relatively much higher burden infection Norway, lockdown (which time). 

So Norway actually open Sweden much lower burden infection. therefore allow Swedish residents Norway except rare exceptions due relatively higher burden infection Sweden. 

Also, although Norwegians freely go Sweden back, quarantine 10 days upon return Sweden could fined. Therefore, Norwegians want go Sweden want 1. face higher chance get infected Sweden 2. sit quarantine. 

This behavior hurts border shops Swedish side. Norway lot wealthy per capita Sweden things expensive Norway Sweden. normal times, many Norwegians live border areas shop Sweden. that, root cause Sweden refused lock like rest Nordics much higher burden infection.

Local governments pretty piss poor response too. Here, leaders local provincial level decided case count low enough reopen economy. turn makes people believe safe now. all, would bars malls open deadly virus spreading?

It's Russian China conspiring murder millions Americans, Brits, Canadians, etc. governments value economy human life. armed police standing guard outside, lockdown house arrest.

Ahhh.. long ago Gladys Berewitchlian bullying states reopening borders. Gladys, borders work don't?? One, pretty sure number wrong. Math best subject, 0.26 death rate pretty catastrophic. saying 1 4 die this. 

Two, direct virus deaths. Yeah, lot people recovering virus I'm ICUs that's awesome, ICUs full Covid patients, happens there's terrible car accident? gunshot victim? happens nearest hospital full need urgent medical care?

## Abstract

In late 2019, outbreak severe respiratory disease caused emerging coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, resulted high morbidity mortality infected Complete understanding COVID-19, multi-faceted disease caused SARS-CoV-2, requires suitable small animal models, development evaluation vaccines age-dependent differences COVID-19 identified compared course SARS-CoV-2 infection young aged Syrian hamsters. show virus replication upper lower respiratory tract independent age animals. However, older hamsters exhibited pronounced consistent weight loss. *In situ* hybridization lungs identified viral RNA bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelial cells type II, macrophages. Histopathology revealed clear age-dependent differences, young hamsters launching earlier stronger immune cell influx aged hamsters. latter developed conspicuous alveolar perivascular edema, indicating vascular leakage. contrast, observed rapid lung recovery day 14 infection young hamsters. propose comparative assessment young versus aged hamsters SARS-CoV-2 vaccines treatments may yield valuable information small-animal model appears mirror age-dependent differences human patients. because

Man could sworn closed March. Silly me. Awesome FUN FACT: number patients biggest cluster cases happened Malaysia, Sri Petaling Cluster, reduced 1. cluster 3,375 cases 34 deaths involving five generations. Malaysia also targeted new cases mid July would argue thousands people strokes, organ transplants amputated limbs permanent disabilities. This. virus temporary relatively minor threat terms life earth... Climate change existential needs every bit much attention COVID. wear mask slow spread save vulnerable people judging post history seem short empathy. One first things driver said 'I care wear mask"".

I'd get ASAP. Okay, don’t lungs, mask required would actually interesting break numbers self described introverts extroverts. feeling extroverted people likely gain weight get depressed they're less used lifestyle. Introverts better suited thrive way life. Multi class cleric.

Went BLM enteroge 
GoV close airports borders stating Covid ""LOW RISK CANADIANS "" - P HADJU .

So afraid - ? shadow?

Bizarre Call legislators demand action, protest, advocate etc.? Sad used data holiday (plus US use term ""bank holiday""). Actually, no. 200 scientists discovered C19 completely airborne large droplets, meaning stay air 9 hours. infected people building higher viral load, sick get. Masks help, combined social distancing *meeting outside* new development means distance 8 meters two. Also, unless wearing goggles catch exposed mucus membranes too.  live even matter? Every persons vote count presidential election popular vote win. Welcome Arizona! That's culture is. relatives went big barbecue/party 4th without care world. Hell, people even realize they'll fresh water within decades, Wife never regretted leaving state...I sometimes miss desert people. difference created two different sects shia sunni literally true political leader islam. sacred book, difference prayer powers men faith. simply politics. idk read real difference anything different.

and people went wars political reasons like ever since wars became thing. Bank holiday thing US. Maybe part, common phrase here. No, make up. linked article talks new ""guidelines"" regarding people positive antibody tests.

Either English comprehension sufficient enough understand term ""in realm of"" mean government specifically talked ""immunity passports""... know damn well that's OP said simply trying make false accusation based willful misinterpretation said. know I'm trying safe double check health others new location. Hospital staff get infected spread communities otherwise ok job slowing spread.

Places worked hard keep control going stuck supporting places care enough try. Feels like punishment careful. ""active cases"" useless metric.  take rolling window 14 days, consider active cases.  vacations great - pool parties poppin' convention big party season.

Alas ain't shit 2021 whenever vaccine daughter come back early Thanksgiving infect rest family! Woohoo! Oh, already charged thousands dollars education possible infection! Kaching! Seriously - actually kill daughter you! school asking sign release form? so, send her. It’s trap. number projected deaths revised? way 200,000 worst case scenario anymore. looks like best case right now. meetings, rallies thousands people stares bleakly us twenty dollar bill, curious expression face. mix ""I see stuffing greasy syrup-stained thong"" ""The blood ancients shall keep alive long you, colony, dust"" guy replying inferred Electoral College could get together upset convention voting ""loser"" election, even somebody ballot.

Maybe I'll come end Janaury (inauguration) party, goes well. Seat next Hussein guy, Kenya, heard he's pretty cool. mainly Russian disinfo operatives want it. 20% Albertans got propagandized idea. wait two months now. may need billions much realistic they've under-reporting accurate counts showing now. Yeah Trudeau really care helping one side another domestic US politics, fact would actively avoid things would perceived such. interests Canada's actions would perceived home, avoiding this. aren't.  got money US government+ places. They'll break even, make huge profit suggesting. study done contract tracing Wuhan.

of ~1200 documented transmissions 2 outside.

even poorly conducted pretty strong indicator. So? people=more say. say live middle nowhere vs someone surrounded thousands people? Clicking gums together ease shock Question unfamiliar — Miami-Dade already closed things last? “re-closing” things first time they’ve closed anything? I'm insane pressure relatives make major events, birthdays etc. Every time say moan whine can't see grand babies. make fun believing first place. relationship strained best. hard, I'm known crazy stubborn. would probably last election Science? True, science evolving past several months. friends sides aisle one thing agree need use common sense. 

If going indoors, wear mask. outside plenty room, fun. 

This weekend excellent. spent entire time boat wife kids. 🍻 reasoning that's problem. said seatbelt thing, said ""yeah wearing seatbelt bother me"" said ""CANCER TREATMENT BOTHER YOU?.

""No benefits outweigh drawbacks""

So go, basically opinion inconvenience wearing mask outweigh drawback killing someone else, even someone circle friends. Lol Detroit Red Wings? thought new citizens forced sit season Winnipeg Jets games could upgrade Leafs tickets. Zip locs.

it's mainly people private parties acting like horses asses public, restaurants such. Indoors virus likes best.

We even know infectious amount yet. state specific less coroners, data recorders, healthcare IT, state data people etc. work weekends. Especially fourth July weekend. Leads weekend numbers always lower do. lot people assume. make headlines. church rarely gets coverage unless wacko outliers gets better eating drinking fluids Wolf mandate quarantine state travelers. don’t need info. want it. Releasing health info used president. They’d pointlessly exposing masses say “oh, that’s doing.” go day. “fair” trade. city gets flooded every summer except maybe two weeks august Exactly. really says lot weakness position cannot attack argument instead resort attacking person making argument. Kinda like grow numb incompetent idiot president.  $1200 checks make everyone happy sorry, border's closed. (unless travelling Alaska, visiting family, checking property, coming work. even flying visit infecting Nova Scotia) It’s sad, I’m gonna surprised actually happens. Ah, see. Thanks clarification. I'm US missed that. Public transportation passengers worst. tried explain Japanese friend public health experts politicians said mass gatherings/protests okay pandemic, racism, truly understand. thought issue English. AutoMod it. comment blocked describing climate US full key trigger words. made appeal mods, reinstated comment. Yes, makes feel little better knowing *all* crazy people. Ah interesting, thanks telling me. still think blanket border closure tourists mandatory quarantine.

Though reason believe virus already USA point, perhaps would useful. rhetorical necessarily directed US, social factors hurt blacks much white bullies guns. resumé might passed ""black"" name, example. Widespread individual racism problem prevent group integrating. I'll also add vast majority whites slaves, lot often poorest, least-educated whites wanting always lower-class group ex-slave former owners. already sending others Albuquerque San Diego, per article. say would, even area little enforcement, would still something person acting like that. let continue things like this, essentially nothing it, even third world country, would SOMETHING even bad.

That's understanding meant anyways. WTF smoking made post? Seems like smart decision. validate Trumps incompetency.  ironic thing Trudeau could already immune, big news couple months ago entire Trudeau family housebound weeks wife tested positive. Still agree decision head southward though. Oh ok get sick then.... WTF dude Yes, saw morning, that's great !!!! said ""30 miles south"", making reference USA country, specific states side border. answer worded poorly, mistake. make mistake it, Canadians want USA succeed this. measures take Michigan got things control? Agreed completely. study flawed using correlated data point. People downvote nuance thing around here. nothing, us us. adorable critter I've ever seen!! There’s message clear enough idiots. Punishment real option, that’s happening. Good him, trump wants photo op deal orchestrated anyway ""Fair"" small states say large states? always undemocratic. way small colonies would join. better deal. got bunch stuff return 5% milk imports. He’s idiot thinks ran us over. caronavirus Racist. ban it. explain without sounding much like cunt (I can't really) ... Even issues first past post voting system, still 60 million votes him. fully aware voter suppression, gerrymeandering fptp fucked up, Trump wins 2020, there's still 60 million racist pieces shit country. rounding error, literally shithole country full worst human pieces garbage planet. already are. race thing...all people colors protesting..going bars restaurant fuck would wear mask take sitting eating. Got damn Well several studies show masks little none effect prevention virus spreading. also studies showing good effect preventing spreading. It’s quite uncertain, believe might actual answers time next year Embarrassed influencing young voters... amount ethics guy broken support cause amazing.. guys fucking wizard.. fools dick group hiding zombie bite. friends tagged local bar, masks. got invite one flat told ""Orlando's 11K cases alone (more since then) 300 new ones yesterday - miss I'm going post vaccine."" get response that.

Edit: I'm stressed can't even spell happened mother's manager. staffing admin bailed like group 5 remained attend COVID 19 patients nursing home. mom, RN, also one remained. awful. mom depression PTSD result. thinks boss caught virus forgotten put protection beginning stages mess. lasted maybe 2 3 weeks passed away quick. mom still cries whenever name mentioned. think feels little guilty getting worse, actually patient days constantly gave encouragement hope fight virus worsened. ended rushed ICU local hospital eventually put medical coma body finally gave him.

And mom, like weeks later one tested negative everyone else stay home days due exposure. Now, get tested every Fridays. Yup, awful q tip stuck nose every week now. Thankfully, patients fully recovering death weeks. two work colleagues also passed virus; one kitchen aide CNA.

I think mom got spared PPE purchased peak virus. Everyone else deal crappy masks might well sold discount store even trash bags use smocks. FINALLY receive donation better quality PPE long ago though.... quick look state's stats tell deaths going come future. Spikes happened last week two.

The spikes likely mostly young people.

The cases likely found early.

The lag infection death multiple weeks.

For now, happy deaths spiked yet, stop vigilant, look extrapolate larger meaning. likely story second spike deaths coming. month never happened, change narrative. since that's almost impossible, prep worst, hope best. Vaccine H1N1. Read permanent brain damage. 

Vaccine H1N1 1976. Gerald Ford forced American population. disastrous effects. (Link below) 

Vaccine SARS. Fortunately never needed, caused permanent immune damage ferrets. 

When vaccines properly tested, they’re absolutely important. they’re — even DNA type opposed live viruses — side effects. 

Perhaps lovely moderators remove info showcase biases, here’s helpful read case you’re young remember debacles vaccines: 

""Yet rare occasions, vital evidence-based process vaccine development testing still ignored. 1976, concerns emergence new swine flu strain reminiscent lethal 1918 version led President Gerald Ford convene panel recommended government-backed mass vaccination program. Poorly conceived, attempt vaccinate US population breakneck speed failed virtually every respect. Safety standards deteriorated one manufacturer produced incorrect strain. vaccine tested poorly children who, depending form vaccine tested, either developed adverse reactions high fevers sore arms mount immune response all. "" 3 million confirmed 300 million still infected. shocks *just* now. Thank request, comrade.

Sure, simply can't answer question without better idea number. 

It vary widely different viruses. original SARS 1,000 particles, norovirus low 15. much higher, too. No, BC went phase (just slightly less open Sweden). two differences: 1. lockdownds imposed earlier; 2 people generally complied. Actually enforcing lockdown would helped lot. Also restricted list “essential” services. instance: supposed driving around, auto mechanics didn’t need open. Boat marinas didn’t need open. Carry-out places could closed, large number could (I.e 10 McDonald’s 20 mile radius needed open) Also police stopping people asking going checking licenses make sure live area.

But local national health leaders copy whatever says, STILL mandatory mask laws insist washing hands important mask. 

The needs held accountable trying block information public. Thanks in-depth reply. Coming tech background, I've also run experience hiring interviewing candidates. candidate looks great paper- upon giving test, can't said do. times, they've personality issues- make fit existing team. hiring traveling nurses, thought thing. need check references. Add step hiring process, that's lot work. Half? like 3/4ths danger that, huge incentives first, people cut corners. 

If feel like vaccine going work, like pretty convinced, might cut corners one gets finish line first. 

It first time history science medicine. Good boy! app phone calls obese. lose 3kg, I'm not. Nobody would look call obese, even doctor. scale take build consideration. young girl obese normal standard. it. every business afford though. Yeah authors article blissfully uninterested raging debate whether statistically ""excess"" deaths counted COVID deaths purposes calculating fatality rates. They're pointing lots people died April/May who, statistically, have. big chunk caused directly virus occured among people may even infected. They're keen observe indirect impacts pandemic response killing people, too. vaccine would useless?

edit: asking like stops April. longer

Yeah, 2 weeks cases more. find positive, get tested false positives. mess. doesn’t seem like argument presented want hug Ngl downvotes swayed thinking. can't work home. millions analytical lab equipment garage. Tell tens thousands ""protesters"" stood shoulder shoulder sweating, screaming, spitting, urinating ect. somehow according reddit, responsible spreading Covid 19. put cotton mask n95? we've known start - fucking airborn virus.  


The CDC fucked royally early precautions -- America doubled terrible decision-making, void national leadership, ""muh freedumbs"". stable genius said going go away, going like miracle. live simulation Lol thought diversity strength. curious watch Twitter vid? 

The media hypocrisy astounding. cannot go beach 90 sun socially distance safely, yet parties streets get free pass? think local government dealing FED probability critical load issue. longer exposed virus likely accumulate enough exceed immune system's ability cope goes full imflammatory response. exposure time particle density combined. Walking outside past infected person low risk, standing room poor ventilation 5 min chat high risk. 

As far casual contact say unlikely 0%. I'd say people reporting conservative. Pandemic Sports \#Winning pretty sure child care shut would let know comfortable using open platform would use services using digitally secure medical platform. several different ones. shocked medical practitioner using zoom several known security risks. disingenuous way looking it. Death per million way better death per known infections. That's simplest explanation this.

Universities can't continue fleece young people figure overpriced product is. must never good cruise 3 causes come mind:

1. Treatment improving. good!

2. lag cases deaths. lag grows testing catch pre-symptomatic people earlier process. Catching things early good means deaths still going isnt helpful.

3. Younger people. could mean things. Earlier made less sense test young people, average age confirmed cases higher. young people tested results fewer deaths per confirmed cases. bad! likely also means young people getting sick. Politicians opening bars others effect. I'm sure many people selfish also thinking also right thing helping local businesses. could keep young people might keep case fatality rate trending down, wave younger people getting it, good chance spread young people older people, delay.

Lotta reasons explain happening, many suggest tide turn. happening slowly. Reopening didnt immediately shift behavior, gradually seeing costs now. Polio vaccine created 1952. Mass vaccination began April 1955. standards 50s medicine, fast turn around. 

Today, better testing distribution systems meaning time verification labs mass distribution probably shorter. Likely poor job protecting vulnerable early (see NY nursing homes) and--surprise--they've pretty much died already. KiwiBattlerNZ TenYearsTenDays person, check account history, identical history, ""they"" keep defending arguments. Or...dont condition would need treatment vet? :) article argue could take well 2021 authorities actually approve it. clear incentive actually stick required standards, failing vaccine could disastrous sticking measures 2 months longer.

That said, also depend specific national agency much influence politics it, also much government cares standards. “Vaccines don’t work. fact, means chance catching took shot” level stupid I’m dealing with. two methods heavily tested used decades. switching antigen payload. safety really question, efficacy. I'm making apology too.

It's new mRNA method untested fronts. switching analogy to.

Being cautious new method prudent. old methods, much.

It's moot till actually find one works. wait, incentive first make trust more? Math percentage perhaps quite strongest skill? 

Counting cryllic? going politely disagree evidence behind either lines treatment. Medical professionals trying (and discarding) many types treatments, evidence till holds test time. lung cancer takes decades show up.. associated chemical addictive.. least people want quit smoking.

&amp;#x200B;

this covid thing like wanting wait cancer. NY twice many nursing home deaths total deaths Florida. still constitutes protecting elderly. Especially consider much larger elderly population Florida has. Lol downvoted? California's economy size Canada's, population same, generally holds similar political values...maybe join us. Canadian Frenchies speak kind antiquated French lacks true Frenchiness. I’m obviously talking next school year.

Tons people unemployment alternative work arrangements, allow watch kids.

For example. get back work September, schools shut down, imagine massive child care crisis. every kid child care, aren’t boat sending school like Douchey, amirite? Also 30, we're going able get vaccine next year anyways. Probably close back line public facing person It’s ! /s couple years working lower-wage jobs, quickly came conclusion wasn’t paid enough deal kind confrontation. physical health worth peanuts hour made.

Except, he’s wrong side every issue, thanks bullshit sources believes. really can't stand headlines like these.

883 facilities reporting cases, 1335 cases total looking 1.5 cases per facility likely nothing actual child care facility likely due what's going public. anything, positive sign outbreaks ravaging facilities.

Edit: Another thing note staff twice many infections children child staff ratio likely 10 1 so. gonna downvote medical nomenclature least make argument tell think medical definition ""patient"" wrong whatever issue is. Use words. I’ll take politician. politician. I’d want mitt Romney, Charlie Baker, Bernie, warren. Someone who’s rational cares American people. want stupid ass ride. want boring ass politician. Fuck trump. fuck celebrity wants run. I'm saying want regulated milk market cows pumped full growth hormone antibiotics.  Can’t blame him. country full selfish assholes. makes believe clinical trials done properly?

Trying create fear skepticism without foundation facts exactly problem. 10% total deaths since beginning occurred last weekend, according mayor. new phenomenon, there's even song: Imagine paying top tier tuition online classes none anticipated networking. siding preference pedophilia too? can't cherry pick.

No, idiot recognized disability. largest county country. 10 million people. population many states. figure 3/10 selfish idiots- thats enough spread covid- keep going, especially since help federal level. Ahhh. lot less evil sounding imagining. sends home scripts antibiotics, pharmacy fill yet.

Why? Yes bad luck. Personal anecdotes don’t trump dozens studies. personal anecdote meant anything could say virus doesn’t exist personally don’t know anyone that’s even tested positive. I’m gonna make claim like said, personal anecdotes don’t mean anything. right, let break you, either moron thinking something seriously wrong we're handling statistics surrounding virus.

either right, absolutely double, triple, worse counting new cases (if least checking see someone previously asymptomatic admitted hospital, counting new case, say one keeping track people progressing asymptomatic worse conditions), wrong they're already keeping track progression telling us statistics are.

at least, someone must asking previously tested positive, count person new case once, case could also report new hospitalizations, subset said reporting. even grossly incompetent one tracking entire progress, least give us new hospitalizations make sure person counted new case once. Wait thought sub memeing losing money stock market. guys using real money? completely agree. 

Looking Arizona's COVID dashboard, seems like cases started really ramping end May/early June. 

While say AZ good spot (as clearly false), seem long enough we'd start see explosive increase deaths going to. Deaths lag infections sometimes people ventilators long time passing (RIP Nick Cordero), *most* people pass pass 2+ months later. 

Prior June, looks like AZ deaths, 28, May 7th. highest 34 June 19th, several days seem much line April/May death numbers. 

Every death tragedy, say numbers they're another meaningless statistic. numbers evaluate what's happening, right now, numbers confusing terms exploding case count relatively flat deaths. 

That said, know holiday weekend likely impacted reporting, feel reasonably safe say get end week deaths still flat, entertain idea something really might changing better. ^ guy gets can’t afford it, go anyway. evidence suggests wont:  Covid 19... REPS! sad. fighter end. shows terrible virus be. Broadway performer usually pretty healthy person, healthy lungs, healthy body, fact happened like this, terrible case, goes show people much virus hurt you. 

My thoughts go wife kid. can't imagine awful must feel, sadness heartbreak pain seeing deniers impact kid growing up. Losing father tough. Living without one tougher, knowing died something devastating even harder. CoViD-19 deaths sound pretty horrific. scared straight style program work need see suffering peace found end all. Oh wow didn’t realize that. Thanks info. Way mislead bunch panicky people, bud.

Big difference saw one group mostly masked masked all. One group indoors inside buildings lot, outdoors time. Completely different outcomes. get Endless Bread Sticks can't eat indoors? Way go! Classic bridezilla behavior. “It’s bachelorette, want want it.” numbers money kept pulling future profits present keep rich sacrificing future. one thing remember college freshman days, responsible behavior peers. I’m sorry, masks reduce growth 40%, SINGLE thing reduce growth that. 

I think one... lockdown/quarantine. 

In US, absolutely need well defined thought approach levels... apparently won’t even wash hands sticking mule’s ass. lot us begging masks cause it’s definitely big thing it’s impossible yet far attainable plan that’s actually thought out. understood preprints beginning covid point think slow down.

Example: wondering electric cars solar panels built bodies, even sitting sun entire work day, week would barely generate enough power get extra 5 8 km.

It would much bigger problem cruise ship, moves cutting propellers high-resistance water instead direct contact surfaces (tire road) low air resistance.

That said, wonder hypothetically storage fuel current cruise ships could replaced massive battery packs get swapped fresh ones port-of-call. like Tesla's semi-truck concept, space mass/weight nearly much concern cars. course would require loading equipment hassle hooking fuel line, there's issue limited rare earth metals go batteries, I'm wondering hypothetically. missing high unemployment, pay experienced workers entry-level wages would given someone new. hire someone brand new get someone years experience price? Oh yeah, forget Texas GOP going [annual Houston next week, Texas High School Coaches Association [annual week after, attended thousands people likely wearing masks following social distancing guidelines. 

Texas going absolute clusterfuck next month wah wah truth hurts got walked bathroom something coughed. information change effective non-medical grade masks are? imagine are, ASCs etc become temporary hospitals right now. Even die thing much larger percentage people life long side effects this. fact people taking seriously consequences, fact cases today lockdown going skyrocket number cases deaths. numbers numbers lie. Maybe effects aware Way soon comment mortality rate. spikes good indicator. Media hysteria misinterpretation hospital availability laymen? thorough testing patients? Better householding patients?

Whatever is, harbinger impending doom. conversation 4 days ago Florida still seen increase deaths. showed you, delay tests/hospitalizations deaths saw New York simply long.

I know - maybe better treatments, maybe less high risk people getting sick, maybe testing, we're simply seeing spike deaths doomers saying imminent 3 weeks now. country making people shut business Covid. people believe risk isn’t great enough justify shutdown. argument is. see sides. need call anyone ‘turd’. live Florida college scary.

If admitted hospital illness determine COVID (even minor debilitating), counted COVID hospitalization number?

or

Do admitted due COVID alone? - debilitating COVID time admission addition illness.

Thanks least, someone must asking previously tested positive, count person new case once, case could also report new hospitalizations, subset said reporting. even grossly incompetent one tracking entire progress, least give us new hospitalizations make sure person counted new case once.

Thank kind human popular, think we've operating something popular concept herd immunity many, many, many decades. grandma (who's 100 now), ever dreamed getting booster shot anything. Ever. taught vaccination caught disease. daughter, mom, 79, thing. Entire generations grew absolutely awareness vaccines almost universally wear 15-25 years. mid 40s became accepted larger scale. Herd immunity, much hate admit, context popular thought likely ever existed. Or, point, may achieved 20% population immune time vs. higher numbers thought needed. bodes cancel out. actual response means is, ""Well..."" does, though. Thank That's false. Many people came Europe Americas actually relatively poor well connected. came search gold riches often exploited natives. 

Also, look Inca empire example, conquered subjugated many Andean areas 100 years arrival Spaniards. 

Those tribes brutalized Inca willing aid Spanish conquests, obviously though didnt work well end.

The brutal lust power wealth universal ignorance among humanity. worst hit Europe last lockdown. locked cases consistently reduced. USA actually something similar effected regions meh.....a lot blame go around. Completely nonessential 

Shut Try lockdown 4 manchild roommates 1 bathroom. ;) biggly hands... that, good luck finding UV lights go air handlers right now. trying get around April/May they’re available right now. back order months long Obese shit description then. skinny friend who's height me, weight would look horrible.on him, barely noticeable. deny shit, know need lose bit, I'm obese. typo here.

I understand anything changed here. international student. SEVIS already allow foreign student attend online-only classes stay USA. spring summer semester made exception us want things go back normal. Meaning either open university go back home country. There's delay involved. seem fried already anyway, go volunteer hospital washing bedsheets without mask something like comparing guy halfway hill guy standing top hill. hope quickly recovers. impressive person. really. probably same.

But importantly, take mind self-reported. 4th July, may offices closed normal. There's typically dip deaths Sunday-Monday reporting, offices counties work weekend.

Lets get back root this:

do researchers financial/reputational/career/monetary incentive ones coming vaccine not? Arizona’s positivity test rate 26%, 24% last week; Florida’s rose 19% 16%, Mississippi 17%, 13%, according analysis.

The article could simply said *below Mason-Dixon line* Looks like mom deliberately took steps get rid ""problem."" German restaurant: believe see everything opened classrooms filled kids. places opening showing exact opposite. numbers worthless kids participating society equal footing adults. 1/2) exactly Fauci others worried about.
3) limit exposure/amount people getting one time  may something that. FCC would shut subliminal marketing, information protected. put blanket disclaimer lower corner says ""Viewing make smarter."" understand lessons. know numbers true maybe even low brain hard time accepting them. Guess going learn exponential increase whether want not. Ikr? [...]“It slowed spread COVID-19 bought Tennessee valuable time address health crisis instead using time get things control like states, Tennessee squandered it​, rushing reopen without cautious approach slow spread,” Dr. Milstone said. ​   

In last month, Tennessee seen 70 percent rise COVID-19 hospitalizations, 56 precent rise ICU admissions, 461 ICU beds remain statewide July 2. data shown Monday news briefing.   

Dr. Milstone, leading coalition 60 critical care doctors addressed Gov. Lee’s efforts mitigate spread COVID-19, outlining immediate interventions doctors believe needed slow virus’ spread.   

“Their lungs literally turned stone,” Dr. Jigme Sethi, Chief Pulmonology Erlanger Hospital​ said. “For think effects comorbidity elderly, experience yes, we’ve fair share elderly comorbidities, we’ve lost surprising number young people.”   

Dr. Sethi said first time 35 years, feels completely helpless ICU.  


“I’ve practicing 35 years want say critical care physician come across disease like this.”   

This doctors urging Gov. Lee take action. They’re asking three things. ​  

​-A statewide mask mandate issued.  
-Ensure Tennessee Pledge protects public requiring employers safety measure place keep people six feet apart wear masks, face consequences.    
-Give mayors power protect public health cities. correct, watched say it. Lunacy. Like say, can't fix stupid.  Yeah, compounds problem. meanwhile, government funds getting tied buying toxic assets. 

It seems matter what, cant spread pain well enough keep things palatable. Oh god media outlet put out. Terrible yellow journalism. simply wont enough vaccine...oxford produce like 1-2billions year nurse doesnt make exempt quack should, don’t disagree. But, unfortunately democratic process tends lead shit candidates electorate doesn’t care enough push better ones. Thanks sharing. hope feel better. Cool, away ""6 feet"" bullshit start telling people get even they're well beyond 6 feet?

Because school work still saying they're opening Fall put markers every 6 feet wash hands wear mask fine. info graphic covers phases guess. comment critique optimism article based incredibly small sample random guy. Tom Hanks. First reopen; first reclose quite past time, sooner better point. aired CNN ? seen 100's videos surfacing? rock? think US ideologically opposed caring people.

We feel like corporation country. bad, already change  countries controlled virus haven't. OP seems like one people looked death count April whined the, ""Flu kills people per year!"" um...no Support what? 100% proof airborne transmission? never claimed case posts. Again, OP. Lock down! 2 10 amazing me. whole lives I've rush day, every day. always childcare school work. tired time pretty much stopped cooking last year. never time self care, always felt ugly can't afford get nails hair done like women know. 
Since quarantine I'm able go biking kids, cook meals, put face mask nails I'd normally sitting office reddit tasks. Normally 7am I'm traffic screaming people, near heart attack trying get office time. I'm usually run dog, making sunday brunch style breakfast Tuesday.

I've always felt like tried hard every facet life: employee, mom, friend, daughter, always coming short. I'm able person want time energy. 

I getting know kids way I've never really gotten mental health never better. life experience opponents unfortunately. Scheer lie insurance broker. Trudy Canadian disgrace/embarrassment, wife slept Idris Elba UK. Marxism anti everything USA stands for. 

I responsible say. understand. Honestly feel like it’s flying by. Today shocked remember isn’t April anymore. 

No seasonal reminders like pools opened summer area, etc. Schools super spreaders. Never mind kids gotten Kawasaki syndrome asymptomatic covid. also mentioned official spokesperson Q Anon, police problems, could call Donald trump.  

Much like opioid epidemic, we've got untreated mental health epidemic country. Well, going bad... going slower good. Ah yes, lets blame specific group people Europe, turned well last time. Yeah, Covid19's like flu. Right... Make extra creamy. Portland nearly 10k every night 38 days. 

Oregon’s going up, amount would seem indicate it’s factor. 

Sorry puts dent little redneck’s ideas they’re ignorant opening soon. (I’m GA, they’re incredibly dumb here.) Minus body aches I've symptoms last years. really microcosm climate change isn’t it? can’t even fix immediate direct threat 2 year period. We’re hopeless fight something like climate change legit best leadership american democracy exists provide. sorry plight. know get day. Good luck! Same. mostly fatigue body headaches, really bad nausea. Fox news told that? entire University system money grab

FIFY see claasic example Europe racist ugliest parts America, long it’s towards Romas. Ya wish someone would punch square mouth. liberal. voted idiot. embarassed did. give us examples instead shouting true Public health guidance needs factor practical concerns alongside scientific evidence. 

Communicating matters scientific debate respect novel virus causing pandemic easy task...folks quick point shortcomings, acknowledge fundamental warnings outset, countries ill-prepared people taking basic precautions. Yeah was, otherwise would've hopped immediately things started single death there. thing raging control months

How say ""Raging control months"" past 2 months seen steady continuous 75% decrease Covid deaths? played villains Cloud Atlas. amazes nowadays managers still think office jobs efficiently evaluated punch clock walk around cubicle clusters.

If goals set, metrics check, regular discussions people projects workload, really need see work. That's understanding. mayor repeatedly argued Arizona reopened lockdown early.

I agree although that's worth anything. Private grade schools charge college private school prices same. 

The thing private schools expel students refuse wear masks cooperate measures.  take coronavirus seriously afford it, private school got way, way better.

Public schools can't really much students whose parents tell need wear masks. sub would get downvoted saying “the plural anecdote data”. need pull finger get move read comment? That’s exactly looked rolling 5 day average. couldn’t find official 7 day average. WaPo doesn’t cite source, it’s really hard check math. 

But regardless John Hopkins data authoritative. situation absolutely dire. headline misleading. Oh like national database homeschooling kids spend lives? eating healthy fighting here? Yet, people, claiming ADA, people care ADA disabled people time... Constitution prevents it. Thank goodness. 

Or else President make everyone wear MAGA hat? wish could laugh this, I've seen much cancer drugs. really far truth. parents work home supposedly homeschooling well. black lives matter. I've poster good standing sub since made 'serious sub' (switching r/China_Flu) since January. trolls harass typically long posting histories any. also claimed work Whitehouse.  

Nucking futs. hate people use #3 excuse take anything seriously. high risk, I'm less afraid dying, I'm quite afraid put entire life hold months recover. Fuck post political No, there's definite attempt spreading FUD here. ""Crosstalk"" corporate jargon ""irrelevant bullshit"". There's research supports possibly happening SARS vaccines. Basically, case, want vaccine create antibodies pathogen gets inside you, antibodies less neutralize destroy pathogen expected (I'm grossly simplifying ignoring full spectrum types antibodies, T-Cells, B-Cells, that). 

It's observed rather preferred response happens, inflammatory response happens, resulting things like pneumonia ARDS. 

In terms ""flooding thinking invaded"" - safety tests for. term ""cytokine storm"" less coined due test perfectly healthy college kids volunteered research - severe inflammatory response. 

The phase II trials less leave us confident we're injecting people something cause response. 🤣 welp media spins protests political bias - science else would considered harmful truth possible long term effects virus simply know yet, know long term studies completed future. would rather cautious avoid infection reason, that's me. That’s appeal authority. Science based experimentation study, consensus. disagreeing conclusions 230 came to, disagreeing act best information; saying asking proof reasonable foundational science. It’s mind boggling celebrities protesting weeks ago yet completely silent wearing masks. would think celebrities would concerned seeing COVID greatly affecting minorities poverty. Eat greens wrong 

But wrong? Kissinger going live forever, he? hope mods backbone remove post. Hopefully ban outright attitude. statement factual. First, literal protests *against* local governments, anti-racism protests anti-covid-19 protests. no, lot ""cheering"" coming government either type demonstration.  Second, exceptionally small amounts actual punishment meted people violating safe practices covid-19.  tickets there.

Viral load plays huge part. much you’re exposed get play huge part sick get.

For it’s worth, much viral load you’re exposed kinda random since we’re talking tiny particles. said, wearing mask may keep getting it, understand lessen much you’re exposed to, makes difference. living since March 10th spikes off. A&amp;M first coronavirus test USA. following virus early on. see concern virus getting vulnerable population. hope virus helps bring attention vulnerable population often given enough attention. 

I calculated deaths per positive case county comes .0084%. Ok understood correctly sarcastic understand downvotes... :/ Lessons learned... We've trying make coronavirus vac 50 years.. Freud would field day language using. mother one lung ( cancer survivor ) insists wearing mask even though said trouble breathng humid.. wears anyways... gets frustrated people just.. won't. gets winded laundry.. gets covid... she'll die.

I’m almost 50 since March. first week two lockdown sort went rails junk food stuff could get store time. makes meal prepping exercise easier. Lol haven’t yet seen article compares Sweden long run, higher exposure (possible immunity?) throughout population, compared countries first locked reopened. Especially remove nursing homes, obviously huge failure countries, Sweden particular. 

Anyone know good article like this? leaders pretty much every one US' traditional 'allies' despise Trump use Coronavirus avoid meaningful interaction Trump hopefully loses election. Merkel less said much publicly sounds awful sorry. turn COVID? probably treating plasma recovered person. way anti-bodies really need worry much getting sick. People know Spanish culture me: race-baiting/scapegoating terms Spanish flu would 1917 Trump come with? Even fluent Spanish, can't think anything good. need grade school-level Trumpy smarts. Something flamenco? Flumenco? grateful he's still alive. stay home point? group kids asked stay one room whole day sounds like nightmare everyone involved. believe that's correct. could find mouse studies happened indicator group thinking permeated established behaviour. single person downvoted given counterpoint, one read maybe I'm wrong, starts addressingost Canadians person could simply generalize away contempt political system.

What worse, besides inability majority people communicate ideas instead hot air, everyone wants part population wave; Trudeau perfect type person new wave whiny adult-children latch onto venerate looks pretty says pretty words want hear.

I dissent, happy downvotes. Otherwise might begin think infected lunacy persists subreddit. also local studies thst show numbers near 20% affected areas Madrid region, like Torrejón de Ardoz Alcalá de Henares (~100.000 ~200.000 people respectively) Though probably lack methodological reliability national study. testament fact body building isn’t fit, athletic shape. don’t know. hunch paid sick leave plays huge role. face hard decisions keeping family fed, clothed, sheltered spreading Covid-19 huge effect. Trudeau - ""Nah....I'll sit rest administration out. HMU Nov. uWu"" think message probably fall on”dumb” ears. Pretty much zero filming right now. video content either animated, stock footage self filmed. Soaps closed far know. Europe may little ahead us US, think it’s still (except Sweden, allowed degree filming throughout)

A lot companies seemed ready US maybe start bringing people back prep (need least weeks prep resuming filming), big uptick cases going delay that. 

Impossible say long. I’ve told two different start dates already come gone. Excited extra unemployment benefits run month, I’m also eager work it’s gonna half-assed unsafe. 

Some commercials lower budget small crew stuff starting, super small scale.

Random aside: Tyler Perry accidental fucking genius happened buy defunct military base house production studios little ways back. ability house fully quarantine productions they’re working. shows like mine lot filming real world locations, would impossible. tenured professors old AF.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  lord rings shite. love ""it's flu"" people. I'll remind novel pandemic flu killed fifty million people.

I'm sorry ask people. bartend patrons whatever want Georgia. I'd hate conversation multiple times day. Ignorance choice. Fuck them.  darwin award category someone kills someone else stupidity? ... realize things like change progress, sometimes recovery painful, disease itself. body lot healing do, that, basically sacrifice things. basically coming discussion user focus showing Sweden negative light, 10 posts per day Sweden. hope Trump making good bet. truly do.

But almost every part thinks wrong. Easy way find out: AC controller unit? accurately control temperature apartment? antibiotics warning! /s enough college students died yet view... 38 hell lower European countries. 
I’ve saying months. obese, diabetic chronic conditions made America incredibly vulnerable lead younger people dying conditions. world says virus affects, change within next months. Wow... comment got removed political mods. re-read wrote see it. motorcycle 5 month old gas replaced carb says different ok lol. That's exactly Government wants do. Put lives line students go Europe school, Economy remain strong.  Hand sanitizer kills 99% germs, I'll never use Lmao! know right. comment especially chosen scrubbed, political comment responding to, less civil rest. big myth medical careers takes intelligence succeed: actually takes conscientiousness. Depends state. rural areas even covid hospitalizations. Rio Grande Valley 10 12 total hospitals region reached 100% capacity weekend. ICU covid units, entire hospital.

One friends valley couple relatives tested positive. One sick got turned away hospital anywhere they've got people even sick expecting many more. daughter high risk. wonder counts murder? people chance treat others hospital? Yikes. last time Bolsonaro rumored tested positive, something lost translation.

someone asked son whatever, responded test went ""very positively""

which....westerners took mean positive confirmed test, good news~ agree starting see hospitalizations? CYA. can't even get people wear masks stores. People engage violence right transmit virus, say big deal. stupidest people elected positions authority. could unite around idiocy, there's way idiots unite around reason, science compassion. totally fucked. September October resistance high. can't tell people spend beautiful fall days inside. People it. Hmmm... France hard lock down, assume paid people stay home, got things control, opened back up, economy set bounce back used be. 

But America....??? What’s changed virus making online classes safer everyone. need extend waiver another semester. Avoiding getting spreading virus important making students attend person classes. Could be. think JT saying, ""Thanks, thanks"" right thing do. JT pretty good approval rating right now, boosted covid19. Canada likes US people, think would fair say Canadians entirely enchanted Trump. JT could hurt ratings Canada friendly Trump, frankly, covid19 problem US bit concern Canada. Certainly problem US, course, worlds record-breaker covid19 deaths right doorstep. little unnerving. Eh, BC never lockdown currently lowest rates country. families might able scrape couple hundred dollars, time take vacation. still testing everyone seasonal allergies Austin? Genius. easy say that... correct.  president cares image. knew would take blame, would acted differently. 

Not saying would done better job, pressure would vastly different. Even shitty team better job work together. awesome, except bit getting hit truck. part sucks. 

I'm speaking likelihood. people spry healthy really late ages doesnt make reality people. know mean Well no. I'm saying. RemindMe! 3 weeks sub rules wish anyone I'll will. banned wishing Covid anyone. Rule #1 : Civil "" celebrating wishing someone’s illness ""

So, even hard, ""Exercise abundance caution"" comments. I'm glad United States paid southern wall 0.1 people died Unrelated coolest name ever. No, getting clinical extremely hard. know people 3.7 GPA (4.0 As) get in. people pass class still stupid. know biology class final paper effects climate change states. knew people wrote paper professor wanted otherwise belive climate change. 

Also (at least state), lot nursing schools tied hospitals funded church. require take theology class. professors conservative. one taught nursing schools went rate abortion. get people pass science classes taught complete nutjobs. one quick oxford already passed safety trials explain illinois very, deaths opened up? It’s socially distancing. tell u. it’s lockdown. It’s something else.  Great resource, thank much. Yet excess death numbers show significant increase overall death know whining about, worked. daughter die Coronavirus never now. 

Truly miracle drug. Illinois, entire industries slated stay closed vaccine. concerts, festivals, comedy shows, musicals, plays. weddings 50 people. Chicago, restaurants capacity greater 25%. Many large tourist sites remain (mostly) closed conferences, means millions visitors staying hotels, eating restaurants, shopping, etc. went exactly problem idea think everyone going masks taking social distancing precautions...

It's hard reach herd immunity large portion US actively avoiding virus wearing masks, social distancing working home/staying inside more.

So yeah, herd immunity pipe dream significant amount population taking extra precautions want catch virus. Doesn’t matter sadly. still many Trump’s base shift blame away Trump. Everything negative someone else’s fault, everything positive doing. around high risk people. symptoms matter? give Pro sports 2020. happening, matter bored everyone is. Yikes, America declining alarming rate. doctors nurses, could forget people risk lives make sure we, sick, die comfortably possible /s

We American species deserve everything coming us.

If nurse doctor reading this, please save yourself, go work anymore. said rate ""stabilized"" 40k day US. US population 331M.

331million/40k/365= 22.7 years

My point would stabilize, point lot fuel fire burn long time people seem realize it.

You're right, exactly know would look like there's good vaccine expected 50% effective fact half America probably wont take leaves 75% fuel burn. (Again confirming idea)

The rest agree with. remembered history probably anything else, think history kind (at least hope not) Whatev... say come campus “special person course” per week meet requirements. Holy shit.

Supposedly woman educated science healthcare, too.

There’s hope us. conflating “every european came new world rich slaver” “Rich Europeans *who mostly stayed Europe* responsible shipping bunch Africans New world, tremenous death toll, could get sugar snuff generally exploit rest everyone.” Observing poor europeans native americans also exploited isnt sort counter-argument whatsoever. actually proves point- many new world colors descendants victims tremendous abuse hands greedy rich europeans. today’s greedy rich Europeans descendants abusers. 

None wrote refutes well documented statement europe invented perpetrated specific style transatlantic intercontinental African slave trade New World. You’re noting additional brutality also took place, refuting Europe conceived implemented genocidal Jamaican seasoning camps, itvwas Europe whose demand sugar snuff stealing value another’s labor led export factories popping along gold coast. Learn history stop bullshit. 

Their invention included new shitty wrinkle unique system vs “contemporary slaves” era - unlike native African native American enslavement losers wars criminals instead jailing execution, children African slaves brought new world Europeans would ALSO chattel. 

Save whataboutism, save attempt making right two wrongs.  wrote 100% true comment nothing it. “Guys, second derivative zero! it!” think depends learn virus treatments. people dying long term impacts, even moderate, people change. know Thanksgiving Christmas. one even knows Estonia is. absolutely unbelievable, we're seeing worst chapter modern US history unfold eyes. Worse handling global pandemic anyone could imagined, writing deaths, putting everyone unnecessary risk, etc.  


There already crazy stat saying something along lines year already 30% increase deaths year average (in reasonable range years). Combine fact deaths overall regular reasons like car accidents injuries paints scary picture.  sound like anything would helped going party exposed. teenager immunocompromised, doubt course treatment would worked.

Just case need valid treatment Testing severly lacking back March April, true number daily cases certainly much higher today. course mean current spike based increased testing, real increase. lot ""mild"" cases found days access testing improved.

Other reasons may include younger demographic involved, better treatments, deaths lagging indicator.

Long story short: comparing death rates months ago today misleading. Raise hand saw coming miles away. rallies, shouting, wrestling - should’ve seen too. truly worst enemies. Tons cops got NY March/April ton died. preview carnage come. themselves. Oh.... uh.....no? 


BNO reporting too, saying showing symptoms Brazil article here: honestly feel like dudes look way better beard... provided super patchy gross

it's like make up, men agree seem making excuses way AZ handled believe handled extremely poorly. Confronted

“...Why, cuz I’m blond white woman?” really solve problem either. (in example,. still penalizing person.. different way). Also,. penalizing ways (""not able get apartment"").. might push crime/desperation spiral.

What really interdiction PRIOR (making changes society people commit crimes 1st place). Course,. that's much harder thing do. 

Until reach point though,. (in view) lot responsibility lies individual citizens. Nobody holding gun people's heads forcing commit crimes. pretty easy stay jail.

Sometimes people believe education protects slipping logical fallacies like. matter educated are, stay vigilant resist overconfidence. That's 2 cents. dunno, anti-authoritarianism seem airheaded previous authority gave Hitler free rein bomb guys air. realize Francoist Spain, looking outside seems like there's history mistreatment France too. already overwhelmed. Denying typical thing days. Transferring people away one scams. Yeah vaccine end Summer every nation moving Sweden did. Economic societal pressure way overwhelming. I've trying say day subtle tone, article popped gotta stop pretending religion joke causes harm good. article clearly highlights that, article clearly highlights that. I've said abbreviated piece mental illness religion down. Thanks article, I'm going go cry bathroom floor lights now, hope simulation downloads patch 2020. John Snow checked bunch different places cholera could infecting people, traced drinking water drawn well downriver London, water contained infected poop people dumped river. shutting pump making people draw water another one upriver city, got cleaner water epidemic God bless us, everyone hate fact I’ve felt years way virus even hit :/ Man fuck shareholders. comes surveys self-reported behavior vs mobility data, would trust mobility data more. 

Someone correctly pointed surveys aren’t replicable way measure behavior, conceded.

Unfortunately nothing third party reported exists mask wearing aware of. seen surveys. Check back us 14 days . Particularly Dublin region silly gatherings streets outside bars weekend water canon needed put manners idiots days ago, Halene woke fever nausea. parents took doctor, since shortness breath — one primary symptoms coronavirus — immediately tested COVID-19.

This everyone automatically tested. Idiots missed many cases requiring certain symptoms travel. NYC missed Italian cases would test people China. American, feel like Europe generally chill pop off, *pop fuck off* I've much faithful taking multi-supplements, include 100% daily Vitamin per serving, every day. Harvard N95 poor seal less effective good fabric mask according Table 5, instead paper towel, find blue shop towel? Peter Tsai, one scientists invented N95 mask, made recommendation. 

Airplanes reported super-spreader events far, think long everyone masked reasonably safe, additional protection, consider keeping personal fan on, anyone emitting infectious particles near you, airflow fan may help dilute particles reduce risk infection. Yeah. saw lots breathing nose good. nothing effect whether exhale nose mouth. forcing it's, forced treatment work. actually getting help unless recognize need they're open trying it. Unfortunately society labelled mental illness horrible light lot folks unwilling give chance ""I'm crazy full-time job mortgage!!""  Nah. It’s late unkill people it’s late prevent future deaths. could issue US though, wouldn’t it? Specifically TX, FL, AZ, places spiking hard. Yeah stepped previous position wanted governor. fact didn’t means never truly believe won. mother nurse took immunocompromised daughter 100 person gathering masks required? treated snakeoil, i.e. HCQ? nursing license rescinded? charged child endangerment?

The loss child punishment enough, woman pretty much killed child gross stupidity.

I pro-mask &amp; confront people every time must go inside business necessity.

I prefer get information news source rather blog. blog.

 Cloth face coverings worn children age 2 anyone trouble breathing, unconscious, incapacitated, otherwise unable remove mask without assistance. I’m mostly speculative, even that’s effective vaccine ends I’d still call victory. Getting cold tends catastrophic problem majority people. don’t understand stopped.

Perhaps want know answer. interesting link within optimal pool size based prevalent expect be. Basically, widespread, less useful pool testing. However even hot spot levels (AZ's 20%+ positive rate, example) still see 20% savings. However looks like positive rate goes 30% going save anything. Fuck people. I'm bothered freedumbs protecting. saying start. United States united dirt, unity here. 

When law enforcement released statements going enforce executive orders could already see going sideways. What's point elected officials population want listen.

French: hold wine Cancer high chance killing you, especially treating it. COVID far lower chance, even immunocompromised. keep using word ""xenophobia"" yet I've lots friends countries like Turkey, Serbia Bosnia Herzegovina guess what? probably first one agree subject, I'm assuming racists aswell, damm shame aint blind delusional like others(like yourself). sources articles based on? different speculation March? find breathing nose natural. breathe nose exhale mouth really awkward. start feeling dry mouth everyone else smell breath 2 pounds garlic lunch. People vampires around drop like flies. 

So exhale mouth? Read username Still? never said ""everyone"" rather common problem. hear lot think talk lying. 

I've Sweden several times thought quite nice. go back anytime near future due awful COVID response, sadly. thought year vaccine? Wait, people calling ""pandy"" too? long hiding basement? o.O Probably second someone even sniffles near Trump, get bag stuffed head kept away him. He's big strong virus would probably wreak havoc piece shit made single argument making. Essentially creating straw man. stayed one example, one example only. Go yell clouds instead made arguments saying. made zero statements current system good (in fact stated opposite) gofundme good thing paying medical bills. “I want build pipeline it.”  almost amazing braid dead idea too. We're probably talking dozens upon dozens people involved something like this, secret service, (whatever Canadian equivalent is), staff.

After quarantine bunch secret service Trump's moronic campaign rally weeks ago too. I’m imagining painful diplomacy involved dealing trump. Trudeau probably quite relieved reason go. 

Trudeau painful, diplomatic action Herd immunity largely based r0. wear masks lower r0, far fewer infections needed achieve herd immunity.  getting? nothing entire states skipping reporting. Read article. Northern Idaho, suspect ignorance knows bounds Wow yeah, it’s almost like United States values capital production products services human lives quality lives. It’s almost like said thing entire economic system woven culture transfer 90 percent new wealth upwards make people “feel bad” taking “sick day” time. Weird huh? read study. think conclusion study. think fallacy journalists.

The fact immune antibodies imply immune people antibodies. also imply people antibodies exposed virus. gets tested every single day surrounding him.

He's 100% aware risks COVID takes pretty much every precaution available make sure get it...he give single fuck anyone else entire country. Without implicit, ""...it looks bad me."" Gotcha, title first X paragraphs read threw me.

It something like, 'Scientists blast reporting aerosol properties sooner."" something.

Instead, like clickbait, I'm reading title wondering NEW information dangers. still ""wear mask, distance, wash hands."" reason problem different states control, others obviously don't. restrict travel states going ping pong virus place. 

I guess next idea limit interstate travel? get is, Rossi actually salvage. captain Donnager gave ship. gift. humility

Most us even know spell it. Mississippi, Arizona, Florida didn't. decide rapidly open up, though.

NYC, DC, Minneapolis big protests took reopening slowly.

Please explain. 

For me, big takeaway outdoor activities nearly dangerous spread indoor activities. would Trudeau that? Trump always serves guest piles fast food. Well again, using data place overrun virus (meaning numbers confirmed cases tends inaccurate). 

While horrible testing, really ramp peak. 

Basically, need number areas huge outbreaks March/April instead testing.

The thing remember basically changes time. get testing, rate goes down. clearly much lower March/April.  major Texas cities. tried mandating phase 1 reopen, Abbott publicly announced unenforceable law. two months later are, Abbott issued mandate he’s prudent now. Meanwhile major European soccer leagues trucking along fine agree everythinhg said. mean insulting look US.
I think everyday life harder minorities US europe. Halfway competent adult perfect descriptor. US toilet right Check wording.

And wouldn't. organization capable keeping sorts samples knows scientific value hold. vaccine work vaccination uptake low samples may hint toward effective treatment. Yeah case tracers NY allowed ask Protest? Like WTF...I support BLM movement can't act like going spread virus.  That’s opposite. That’s completely different story.

Explains lot you. Probably much potato chips fried pig fat. hasn’t. We’re set reopen hospitals near collapse. European countries reopen numbers positivities rates high. get hospitals positivity percentage lowered expect millions teachers students congregate together everyday. won’t possible next 2 months, least. probably won't. Fall = worsening outbreak health officials know anything it. droplet may spread far, research indicate concentrated amount virus, enough cross infectious threshold viral load, spread distance? One particle enough infect. read? said results study square results large body research, people approach study greater degree skepticism. disagree assessment, feel free elaborate. r/downvotedintooblivion Fair enough. issue Gates comments. think seeks add gravity situation, much needed. Bill doesn’t sit home staring specimens magnifying glass; would absolutely flabbergasted find isn’t already can.

Not mention, he’s private citizen. stopped philanthropic work, he’d already made many, many lifetimes difference. absolutely earned right make commentary subject chooses.

The onus shouldn’t Gates ‘not speak’ country full 5G conspiracy morons. You’re insinuating loosely Gates stoking flame moronic idiocy commenting; that’s fault, isn’t really true (they lunatics beforehand) isn’t legitimate reason stop commenting Ah, yes, Sweden. Land free [you can't buy alcohol except state run parents can't choose kids digital / remote learning pandemic. keep children home, Swedish law, [they fined, investigated possibly children removed much freedom! 

Also, NPI recommendations strict Sweden neighboring countries. Danish Queen could go Tivoli already start June, Swedish amusement parks remain closed. Freedom! Need use bathroom en route appointment?

I grant taking care avoid public contact, clearly imaginable circumstances accommodation needs contemplated.

But expect daily concern. think whatever want. agreed TOS signed website. Reddits Private company moderate whatever content wants. 

There platforms express opinion. here. sub.  No. herd immunity lots diseases still exist. Sweetie, 0% chance vaccine tested, produced distributed 6 months. 

Natural herd immunity option virus mutates quickly people once. Yeah seriously. There's many them, mostly fit pattern karma farming clear something inorganic going them. literally insane. hell theme park draws tourists town allowed reopen.

Disney really making rethink annual pass. I’m absolutely sympathetic families child care needs. situation sucks wish better option. 

But throwing colleagues wolves order provide free child care protection population statistically risk seems pretty shitty. couldn’t even classrooms bathrooms cleaned regularly pandemic classes always overenrolled. 36 high schoolers tiny room, wasn’t even allowed cleaning products use things like Lysol wipes. told carry hand sanitiser us times wanted kids wouldn’t drink it. 

Schools cesspools best conditions. best conditions. don’t understand need childcare trump personal safety. already trained deal active shooters whole host mental physical health issues students. don’t feel safe school building pre-pandemic. whole different level risk. *alternativlos*™ think county shut air bnb too. happened last prison happened to? Taking action closing int'l borders earlier (around Feb Italy getting beating) would good idea. initial travel ban started included China, Iran, Japan Italy around Mid-March way late. Even closed borders certain airports open allow citizens back country packed like sardines customs line screening symptoms non-existant.

Our leadership stepped aside let experts speak pitch dangerous conspiracy remedies public. Better lockdown state lines would smart, protecting nursing home residents/staff, consistent messages treat covid (think mixed message hydroxychloroquine &amp; azithromycin, steroids etc), encourage mask use instead lying people useless, better PPE medical workers would help. still finished first wave still ill-prepared. 

N95s still rationed medical workers. public understand masks means adequate working ones. n95s got crumbling fit. bad fitting n95 longer serving original purpose filtering 95% particles. 

People think doctors better equipped fight disease, honestly much changed still mainly supportive care. Doctors wait much longer intubate (still necessary), tell people lay bellys, stopped using hydroxychloroquine, maybe added remdesivir available (it's still widely available). hope patient recovers. Remdesivir keeps advertised savior drug, main purpose reduce days hospitalization/symptoms save life. terrify everyone medically tools stop comes around again. ebenin amı Right America's paying price sure downvoted you’re far Yes they've researching months seems likely husband/father... he's physician's assistant per another article: earth would waste everyone's time responding comment lack credible reports re-infections series links tonwade containing reposts waning antibody levels, early symptom recurrence, reports coronaviruses? trying agree original comment not? Forgive irritated tone reading attempt find point bit trying. Won’t slower diagnosing? infections high, won’t every batch least one positive? put money increasing testing water testing.

This makes sense way measure community levels infection and/or amount infection low. Look states... Good job El sissy. whole providence British Columbia 2,947 cases total! 1335 form childcare facilities outrageous. I’m Georgia governor refused wear mask. He’s flying around state telling people “wear mask it’s mandatory won’t wear one.” WTF message that? Kemp moron.  Yes, spending time indoors near people, especially without masks, risky. Indoor bars, restaurants, gyms, etc. extremely risky. Large house parties extremely risky. Indoor church services extremely risky. Indoor sporting events, concerts, political rallies risky.

In many parts country substantial proportion people blithely going everyday lives refusing take basic precautions, results disaster.

Last month personally concerned possibility protests cause outbreaks, thankfully far doesn’t seem happening. always? pretty large catalog, sure always good guy? oxygen trach public right now? Honest question. People stupid. 

In job, three people 15 wearing masks, even HR sent announcement mandatory. 

But since bosses wearing masks, guess okay everybody else wear them. fully enjoyed continue enjoy it. 100% introvert Myers-Briggs, work teacher, wife disabled also introverted. love video games, live woods, huge food supply, crazy fast internet. got this! basically thing. archive [http://archive.is/jL0uH](http://archive.is/jL0uH) lol need groceries I'm scare go since I'm immunocompromised live Texas. people give damn. something I've heard different contexts.

Neither condition standing anyone's Georgia-ass heat. knew important test result would expediting care hospital. 

I'm glad even able get tested feels wrong complain wait. much ""tracing"" really going all? Probably zero....also protesters registering somewhere monitored?

Common sense says spreading virus, niave. study doesn’t show % positives super hard hit areas Spain, could 5-10x number, also US, Brazil, India choice go herd immunity point. Since death rate come quite significantly, still highly unethical, least 40% people seems fine going route now, it’s something can’t change. However it’s also scary right compared death rate data back early April. It’s gonna incredibly rough journey risk though. One correction, best healthcare... rich. telling think kind worthless people kids? part society? foster dad 5 years, kids parents (Usually one parent neglectful) like this, nobody benefits losers society.

Sounds like totally normal non satanic greek church me! Glad appreciated it! Sweden normal morality levels weeks testing increased massively. I’m sure much better news want.

Sure debate past months, that’s posts do. zero measure. mask mandate social distancing mandatory. large gathering prohibited. virus simply gotten weak many dying. It’ll eventually get point many people won’t even notice getting go away own.

I went wearing mask people looked like crazy person, even smiled like something funny.

At job, one swedes laughed saying covid virus boomer killer. shocking laughed something funny.

Another swede told many Spaniards dying poor.

Another guy also mentioned smile face Somalis dying hundreds sweden somehow culture deserved Somali. 

The thing forgive sound rude. got impression swedes hiding arrogant attitude native swedes somehow another higher level. weird nasty feeling.

From article shared me.

Apparently tried shop Target Texas asked leave wasn’t wearing mask. said she’s filling complaint act telling people boycott Target. wanted badly tell offer curbside pickup didn’t want come across b word. lol Paywall someone please archive it? thanks! Stonks see blessed news. Money. $$$$ Hey.. atleast fl holding around 15%.. right?.. senior U.S. administration official, speaking condition anonymity authorized quoted name, said Trudeau multiple conflicts related start Parliament coronavirus regulations require Canadians travel abroad quarantine 14 days return.

Leading example following conducting online Cabinet meetings instead person meetings coronavirus pandemic.

Contrasting Trump holding person meetings. Here's thing. way system SUPPOSED work uses scientific jargon. media supposed interpret it, disseminate information masses digestible manner.

All statements TECHNICALLY true. average person interpret opposite.

Let's use example. ""no evidence"" Steve murdered Robert mean evidence Steve murder Robert. may evidence there, found yet.

But made mistake assuming system (as described above) still place. world works anymore. give press meetings journos, Twitter account put pressers themselves. can't keep using scientific jargon assume everyone get it.

Hell also ""paint lines"".

Like, take certain medicine unless certain help, hurt. shit like homemade masks - EVEN SURE 100% TRANSMIT PERSON-TO-PERSON RESPIRATORY SYSTEM - hurt recommend.

There valid reasons criticize WHO, honestly feel like people criticizing them, like 20-30% giving valid reasons though... need contact tracing unified message.

Yes masks significant part, yeah, contact tracing testing needs improve. 

I'm terribly skeptical testing numbers. would love know many individuals tested vs. tests performed.

The big hospital region makes staff get tested frequently. also retest patients frequently (we get results office patients, patients getting tested weekly more). yeah testing looks great county they're really testing people 5 times. I'm sure unique situation. 11 cases directly tied 3 people coming home florida Vaca near me. Sweden: Lalala, can’t hear you, I’m immune already (to reason facts)... believe celebrities eating babies literally crazy. Ya'll loco. IMHO fair summary said. First off, start clearly said anyone exhibiting symptoms wearing mask... happen? Criticizing saying stressed greater level precaution folks largely ignoring advice already giving tad disingenuous.

Second, stressed risk 'false sense security' respect masks, IMHO rather fair consideration based knew time. Again, one says ad-hoc masks offer protection individual wearing them, rather limit spread someone already infected... guidance general public need wear masks acknowledged that. time needed people stay home.

Third, real concern availability PPE. say want ad-hoc masks, reality would nonetheless significant portion people trying get hands medical-grade masks time supply. still debate effective ad-hoc masks are, let alone time.

They likely wrong promote use ad-hoc masks, IMHO flat criticism leveled matter largely hindsight.

From quick google, link advice Feb 28. wrong ad-hoc masks, ok. least NYC pretty much one heeding advice give... still people sneezing coughing crowded subway trains, folks still shaking hands meetings, large events still held, etc. think people would started wear bandannas? time dealing SARS responsive government. anymore. Sadly new headlines USA runs course think seeing part picture. knowledge, nobody devaluing peer review (although merits peer review given field important topic). However, many solid, rigorously reviewed studies year more. But, assuage burden act make policy decisions mean time.

This ""listening experts"" (who would often people would conduct review) acting limited information important time being. mention safe enough people actually take it. enough safe effective, anti vaxxers convinced take it. rely personal responsibility for: rape, murder, jaywalking, school attendence 16, cannabis, theft, assault, driving fast, stopping fully stop sign, running unlicensed hot dog stand.

Make mandatory. Add punishment lets move f on. im figuring september/october approval mass vaccinations christmas. usually glass half full type things seem consistently headed right direction. give antivaxxers six months 2021 surrender take shot. full expect people get vaccinated let guard causing rip. parents keep going church. infuriating. makes sense. Cases increasing show masks working protesters factor exactly? comment made laugh dickish lmao Idk wouldn’t surprised thought Spain part Mexico blamed know noticed he's taking guns. like can't buy anymore, like turn government. live everywhere? Majority Americans actually care. idiots you’re seeing news articles technically minority population, problem COVID takes fuck everyone else.

Now add god awful leadership mixed messages public top that, get current circus America’s coronavirus problem. It’s fucked policy though. right know leader incapacitated ensure appropriate official steps place! Like actual VP instead Wilson’s unelected wife. Contrasting agent orange holding in-person campaign rallies, although latest spike cases probably putting kibosh that. won’t Texas whole, Dallas co Harris co. (Harris Houston right?) 

Either ready, won’t shut entire state circumstances. study doesn’t prove it’s humidity change. need animal testing. zero published animal testing COVID. Coworkers must warped sense security. haven’t stopped working year. one one person wear masks. asthmatic coworker doesn’t. one social distances. It’s quite insane think going 5-6 months one getting sick makes seem way comfy.

I started wearing mask hopes others would get scared take seriously. think they’re going change behavior someone gets it. even guy asthma won’t, will? guy, cannot even say certain circulatory problems people linked Corona whether antibodies alone enough prevent catching COVID twice.

Gotta wait see, could three months, could 30 years. still found better way deal common cold drink fluids rest. complicit voice concerns. Nevada, idk generally difficult.  sure haven’t seen credible reports re-infections... Captain Obvious says, ""Water wet virus control"". ridiculous thinking things cant change. Damn. Ok. Ok. Two heads better one here. this. Reportedly Donald Jr's girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle (who 51 years old, reference Melania 50, that's beside point) tested positive COVID, trump became terrified getting it. least according sources within White House. think it’s lot things. We’re also terrible social distancing. lot people, especially younger people, afraid get medical care reason. They’re even reluctant get free COVID test don’t believe won’t huge gotcha bill fact. European countries comparable size lot states. even though interstate travel domestic name it’s easily international distance. households one car opens unlimited infection potential. Parties haven’t really stopped. Bars still open lot states. It’s basically clusterfuck 50 miniature countries thing. 

I believe Hawaii Alaska really well since they’re fortunate enough attached rest us. would support someone opposes Wetʼsuwetʼen people defending land?  second sentence accurate one: hasn’t litigated, hard determine likely outcome would be. would think establishment made good faith effort provide means shop disability would fine, going recommended guidelines state weren’t that, don’t think it’s clear cut. Yeah they're turning away patients driving hour away. Okay bro. trauma regions single digits ICU beds. barely hold glass water. follow tattoo artist Instagram. posted pictures celebrating weekend like 30 people. first place, social distancing, masks.

Anyone Twin Cities tattooer recommendations? I'm market get big piece there's vaccine. downvotes make want get da zoinkys also case neighboring countries. 

Also Denmark buy vodka 7 11 4am. also huge fancy wine booze stores knowledgeable staff well. damn pandemic, 100% right call. trump presidency, pandemic no, also 100% right call. Yeah nobody besides playing politics here... BLM Lives Matter protests. people don’t even comply wear masks follow guidelines. Still ends killing another Black Man person don’t give damm again. people chickenpox get live risk shingles.

COVID done thing dude. know scope long term effects looks like lot instances people bed ridden least ill months following infection.

Oh shit, forgot I'm trapped America... thanks dude. real downer, ya know that? Canada deserve Trudeau. Canadians 6 months ago wanted lynch him. look /r/Canada

Really Trudeau Trump switch places. People delusional right though. probably think go see grandparents leaving grandparent's houses. No, half started. perspective. Lol $50k zoom meetings, also make 2021 spring semester? vaccine comes like September like thinking?  Okay. welcome discussion. that, I’m serious here, “robust” stimulus package allotted $1,200 average joe (most us) - nothing else ever happened? 

Why state federal governments (mostly federal) continued forced us choose health, financial destitution. 

Seriously, explain me. Yeah. say gypsies problems, definitely better. "" analysis, conducted partnership [Applied Newlab Venture Studio company, found one every six trials designed study malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine chloroquine, shown [no benefit hospitalized ""

Not WA-BC border. thing seem really interested whether guns car. Luckily laid couple weeks. feel people laid whole time border closed too! Yeah, heard theory/headlines NY infected rest country there's truth think especially south Florida would pretty much step much factor given amount tourists see many ""local"" people split time two. yes, also takes longer get whatever level need get achieve it, given immunity might wear little could prevent ""herd immunity"" EVER taking hold naturally. need help one. much moist speaking room Trudeau profitable business country, even top military... 60K today weekend, 70K tomorrow? realize ridiculous look trying compare right talk beating politician subreddit rules prohibiting marginalization experienced African Americans via systemic racism? Please. hard done here, man.

Furthermore plenty rules laws follow going get thrown jail, regardless agree them.

For example, truly believe prostitution weed illegal anywhere said partaking either court law knowing established laws already prohibit I'm going go jail breaking law regardless whether ""truly believe"" merit not. That's reality.  essentially ""phase 3"" trials done using whoever gets vaccine first (the elderly, perhaps). neither Trump good portion voter base. nah, half nba teams players testing positive right go infected place earth continue season, even giants aren’t immune Brutal, fair Can't imagine would want even without pandemic. ""bring up"" origins Covid-19 article about. origins Spanish Flu relevant issue United States infecting entire world. issue happens United States somewhere else. people 1918 killed millions.

I'm deleting coronvirus subs, brought lies crap feelings. hope lovely Monday Le0n, take care. virus distorts immune system even clear it, pathogen reenter system cause illness again. hit-and-run catch keep “get forget it” virus able infect person multiple times.

This pure speculation backed meaningful research time. It’s reasonable theory, that’s is. Backing seriously wild. go onto r/canada browse bit. Or, better yet, read local newspaper. Every Monday local paper write section everyone writes 1-2 lines. is, frankly, incredible. used think seniors old grumpy riddled dementia that. live OC too, could lot stores allowing customers enter wear face covering people getting used policy shopping Freedom outside. 🙂🙂☺️☺️😄😄😃😃😆😅😂😂🤣🤣😭😭😘😘 good situation. happens areas full too? senior U.S. administration official, speaking condition anonymity authorized quoted name, said Trudeau multiple conflicts related start Parliament **coronavirus regulations require Canadians travel abroad quarantine 14 days return**. official said **Trudeau asked speak Trump phone.**  “While recent discussions possible participation Canada, prime minister Ottawa week scheduled Cabinet meetings long-planned sitting Parliament,” 

Trudeau DESTROYS Trump facts logic!

... complete non-story Sending ""thoughts prayers"" Yep, ignore problem. makes go away. No, punishment fine. Nice! We're neighbors already! come way first. We'll sort details. Germany indeed outlier since start pandemic, even countries following similar measures, numbers always higher Germany. Government excellent job, added fact Europe's strongest economy, capable withstanding economic impact prolonged confinement without people loosing minds job security. Another big factor excellent healthcare number intensive care beds per capita. 

Speaking healthcare, seems virus either mutating something less serious never ""monstrous"" start (still much deadlier influenza course). portugal generalized panic due limited healthcare resources terms manpower equipment/intensive care units, never reached close reaching limits taxing system breaking point. cases mild, treated home, usually people pull couple weeks, even tho Portuguese population extremely old, numbers deaths intensive care internment much lower expected. sources scientists doctors? Word mouth isn’t admissible court even good evidence journalism. Gonna need word that.

And still important outdoors within 6 feet people, always press conferences/rallies etc. Reading books park definitely safe though. Change groomsman suit hazmat suit good go. guy literally almost died. fundamentally understanding geography history friend shame, nobody called either. don’t actually know person, only
Know someone knows her. friend dropped bachelorette told bride she’s idiot. got couple others drop rest lost cause. state alright even vacuum going go back up. sub 50% mask use places. works awesome that's great news....buuut

Phase 3 trials (more long term affects focused) short see phase 3 trials produce enough begin dispensing end year. effective think still looking spring late winter earliest.

All end year reports imo boost stocks. live see many drivers without seatbelts on, pretty much explains one wearing masks either. demon inside sustains agree, it’s personal belief he’s getting plasma infusions recovered patients too. would certainly protective I’m sure taking hydrochloroquine. never know truth liar. Trump wanted photo op distraction change narrative Y’all know presidents remain office January, right?  virus scares people. Wearing mask admission virus big deal, hurt/kill you. forces people deal fear, least acknowledge it. refusal wear mask way denying virus scary avoid deal emotion fear. 70k may slight stretch Tuesday means I'm ruffling feathers bud. Mission accomplished. Non peer related medrxvi study, trash proven otherwise. thinking thing. Nothing find speaks this. Want understand true social distancing measures 10m 5m? know knowing someone protest actually help contact tracers. possibly use information determine infected person contact with.

Unless, suppose, government compiled database listing names everyone attends every protest. *not* precedent want set... yet, consistent weekend drop persists. would thought? I'm sure keep asking entire states reporting. realize state report lower numbers weekdays,right? Like, know numbers 0 254, yes?

Come man, lazy troll. Try harder. sure that? American Left detests Trump supporters point broken families, friends, marriages. 

At point anyone Trump support member cult MAGA completely exclude life. matter are.

It's like Civil War tensions here. Ok, prepare meat cooked...like chicken, pork....do wash hands touch many many many non Covid related reasons???

Also, cook meat eat it? plasma transfusions antibodies

Trump's sugar daddy, Peter Thiel, liked that. first looks like he's polite actually transforms horrible insult adding ""not sorry"" cheeky twist.

We overexplain obvious situations thread. Yea probably around 45k today expect increases throughout week day  logic seems complex average Florida man Ooooh, I'm tryin' getting hard family accept it. stay away side. sides, really. I'm here, accepting I'll see family long, long time bunch fucking morons want put masks.

This rocket science. Masks help, would ever bad idea use them? People pretty stupid can't work one own. summary failed protect one vulnerable populations supply shortages (PPE, tests), staffing shortages, lack infectious disease procedures. lack federal leadership dismissive attitude many governors made worse.

Some American nursing homes likewise succeeded keeping coronavirus. The Maryland Baptist Aged Home, 30-resident, 100-year-old facility Baltimore, avoided coronavirus cases. director, Derrick DeWitt, told February, U.S. had just 15 known cases, paused family visits community meals, sent vendors delivery drivers separate entrance, brought extra cleaning crews. staff trained social distancing, screened regularly temperature symptoms, asked social activities. DeWitt, following guidance Anthony Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, said ordered extra masks early, began run out.

Meanwhile, elsewhere U.S., virtual opposite played out. Nursing homes ill-equipped, literally figuratively, deal pandemic, federal state governments took hands-off approach late. “I think really dropped ball here,” David C. Grabowski, health-care-policy professor Harvard Medical School, told me. “We done right older adults living nursing homes care them.” america... numbers same. Duh. Damn Germans math. Obviously know talking since mask restricts breathing, depriving brain oxygen. Lol 

/s opting place NOTHING. PEOPLE NOTHING ALL. even surprising, would want listen Trump talk shit high horse pedestal 140,000 deaths White House invite head state tea, everyone supposed minimising travel unnecessary contact? Well, America first one campaign slogans. Looks like that's least one thing managed achieve. there's ""/s"" tag idiots like running around hard know fuck anyone actually thinks anymore. July 2020 really shitty time whip shitty sarcasm. world fucking done it. I'm returning office environment soon, also soon filled students. We're allowed open windows. mask enough protection? Biden said he'd issue executive order requiring them. know much authority well hold he's least willing make call. course didnt challenge that's part problem mentality. deep rooted need change need advocate voters stay complicit continue enable status quo. true. Though many countries EU far right fringe element, far power (however concerns Hungary Poland moment). may seem snarky, there’s actual claims studies showing anabolic steroids like Trenbolone actually fight corona virus body lol Making Obama president bigger mistake opinion Yeah, point really needs driven home. Wear mask, doesn’t make invincible still distance people avoid places wouldn’t go didn’t mask. generally already done in, example, places without wheelchair access. Loads stores ramps, aisles narrow wheelchair fit through. Someone offer pick need. 

Also, think people far overestimate much access ADA actually grants. ""within reason"", pretty minimal. Like, stuck behind heavy door automatic opener wheelchair waiting passer help open parking garage one RMV state handicapped placards minimal. face face? Discord voice helps need social interaction. Sure can't see faces normal conversation. over, won. numbers mean preventing superspreader events could go long way toward stopping COVID-19, says Samuel Scarpino, network scientist studies infectious disease Northeastern University. Scientists identified factors catalyze events, including large crowd sizes, close contact people confined spaces poor ventilation. Current evidence suggests mostly circumstances these, rather biology specific individuals, sets stage extreme spreading novel coronavirus.

But yeah use I’m feeling lonely, thanks :) hope you’re coping situation well! Yep. supposed universal nursing home staff residents May NC. kind weird refer girlfriend dad. It’s medical definition meaning person generate antibodies. Short term immunity like using blood serum. Testing contact tracing key making work without things spiraling control. it’s gonna suck vulnerable

America would rather go straight eugenics keep bars closed wear mask. Cool. That’s research. That’s googling things agree with. Thanks suggestion! I'll give try. Yeah he's real. Real *handsome*

(I tried insult work) NY/NJ Washington State saw happen China, Italy Spain came here. Sadly, people never learn happens them. fema stole ppe states, won’t set testing centers, haven’t set emergency hospitals Texas. 

What waiting ? I'm assuming everyone terrible. born US myself, I'm pretty fond friends family live there. do, however, notice sudden uptick US plates city months citizens returned border still closed.

But yeah, assume mentioning means hate US, guess. Maybe English speakers hung this, ""the live"" ends important lots severe illnesses. classic example losing will-to-live elderly couple die within days other. Another example immune response cancer. Yes skilled treatment important, attitude willingness fight disease make significant difference. Studies show 10 20% differences five-year cancer survival psychological factors. fewer people dying Covid-19 indeed good news, that's going stay way number cases keeps rising exponentially. 

Furthermore, even die risk complications huge hospital bills. many people, hospital bills problem job comes proper health insurance. means stop racing open public places. continue follow Iran’s cases/deaths curves perfectly been, we’re still 2.5 weeks away deaths start climbing (~7/22). Thank you, Trudeau. So, jump down, scream ""Yay, USA""?? well shit, mess time? Tried nothing we're ideas Always blame someone huh also running POC party leader basically said “eh, whatever, realized screwed apologized, it’s fine” story broke. It’s complete non issue now. take steps say they’re going to, around 12-18 months according projections. course don’t know though. one does. really deep thought, brain may shred virus. doubt it. team people job make sure get it. I'd bet whole lot shit behind scenes keep getting it. We’ve already three named storms. started early supposed bad one. 

/r/tropicalweather great sub! Sounds good me, bud! 'eck, that's champion that! AMLO probably want hug kiss everyone along way. I'm sure dependent right word. Canada integrated economy close US we're like conjoined twins. example car made states goes back forth across border many times made. God, honestly horrifying idea leaves pit stomach time. testing many asymptomatic people. lot testing going U.S. professional reasons. wife's university example testing many people can. lead lower percentage positive results. I’m California meeting head or...... reliable antibody tests knowing virus? High profile certainly subjective, but: Boris Johnson. directly poor stool Especially professor 'Georgia Institute Technology' resume. I'm pretty left friends, one gripes left tends he's enough. bought pipeline sending RCMP forcefully clear indigenous territory make room it, campaigning platform environmentalism. took fewer refugees promised. Generally bad record indigenous issues. great job COVID though.  get useful number. 


The numbers I'm interested deaths, ventilator use, ICU patients, hospital patients emergency room visits. different older normally driving different activities every night week.  wife would often shuttle 3 kids 3 different activities (sports, scouts, martial arts, dance, etc) night. 


The pandemic relief regard. gets tested everyday well everyone around him. He's afraid virus, want public know race nationality mentioned article. guess correct! Well done! worse position today started. lockdown nothing.  going get much worse. 

Americans selfish deal something like this. outside protests people wore masks available data shows increased spread?

No.

The lack enforceable guidelines State hot summer temperatures draw people indoors small spaces recirculated air? 

Yes. I'm surprised invited first place given Trump's public dislike him. so... MRGA? two grocery stores delivered, they've stopped delivering ever since started. curbside pickup earliest date week away everytime. sure am! Delaying getting full blood labs, surgery deviated septum, LASIK eyes

the time physically go medical visit year probably going kid's 2 yr vaccines Sept - husband totally dreading Sophie Trudeau voodoo doll? (Still hotter Ivanka.) I'm pretty sure plays type role he's film. entire sewer know demographics, blood types, transmission mechanism. target solving instead blanket policies. self-proclaimed 'data-driven' crowd, lot 'emotion-driven' sentiments he'll yeah brother Canadian here, it’s super easy Americans sneak right now. served couple Oregon yesterday told border driving Alaska. I’ve heard Americans fined they’re country, I’m guessing chances caught pretty low. called way dictator. woman replied comment made actual disabilities masks would dangerous. mentioned elderly mother oxygen still mask doctor said oxygen needed mask others. 
  logic crazy people use nuts become political many less people would infected died? That's hard think Hm, try harder would bet somewhere. national one, try local city one. 

Maybe said ""Germans follow rules recommendations"" . Everyone knows Germans love rules. 


Source: Three four want open leisure trips Sweden: - crystal clear answer read somewhere inmates try pass special permits exit.  blows mind anyone still willing fly days. mean pretty disgusting before, today? made up, news reported since end April, repeated warned it. can’t even comprehend fucking stupid \#MelaniaLovesTrudeau America operates two person working household even scrape many instances. But, kids summer, I'm sure parents summer, maybe daycare pandemic I'm sure things difficult daycares shut many places. fortunate able stay home kids many not. wonder people able provide better families women men, meaning one parent, would want stay home. also wonder stay home parent venerated American society people would want it. Community Based Intervention, likely taxi ride funny farm. mask refusing idiots going get people furloughed cause even stress financial markets. asthma allergies wear one day, it’s hard... suck adult. said he's free next afternoon January 20, 2021. annoying thing Trudeau’s detractors complaining blackface don’t normally problem blackface. Typically, they’d first tell everyone “quit sensitive snowflakes”. 

But Trudeau blackface magically turned bunch woke, politically correct citizens. That’s true. Many people talk aren’t stupid uneducated, though almost none doctors nurses (though retired nurses mix, think leaving workforce makes lose touch reality some). hard watch. guess know people feel children siblings whoever get swept cult. Helpless, astonished, mortified exhausted. blame him. At. All. Fuck Kemp, election should’ve overviewed someone else practical way reach herd immunity still vaccination tbh, even given since many said they'd refuse vaccine.

Already ICUs beds filing/filled places, without speed getting controlled people start massively die sustain long term damages medical care, applies everyone living region. one condescending human lol. People opinions know I'll always express mine. Prepare sanctions United States. Prepare famine step now! anticipate good testing well understood, widely available, widely effective treatment place, addition whatever benefits inferred numerous vaccines development, life could less go back normal almost everyone, except caveat we'd also want normalize mask wearing situations part plan. Also important acknowledge we're yet terms treatment, getting better doubt there's still room major improvements, need continue trying limit spread order protect vulnerable populations. good point. competent pandemic response probably enough benefit outweigh risks practicing good INFOSEC. Yeah friend. I’m sure find way. Nobody left behind. Yeah separatist movement pretty much died out. Yet can't spend 5 minutes /r/canada without reminded apparently want leave Canada. 

What shitty sub Quebecers. smort Man horrifying. 3 million folks caught nasty fucking disease. wonder long Canada Mexico realize need US anymore elope away together. 

I've seen really dumb shit posted attempt America-bash, one Buildings aren’t big enough. Even 6ft hard follow grocery store aisle Speaking moistly TIGHT don’t know call ‘misconception’ data sources aren’t strong. Yougov certainly isn’t. guess rolled facts remembered (polls showing many Americans didn’t still don’t understand ACA Obamacare plan, almost half didn’t realize repealing Obamacare would also repeal ACA) turned something false. Whoops. guess I’ll leave wrongness anyway. Scandinavian country argues for/enforces mask usage. conclusion provides false feeling security. top many people use wrong risk transiting virus. feeling 100% healthy, stay home. half protesting large groups choke bribe money, corrupt fuckers pose hypothetical question: fellow Americans wish done differently handle pandemic?? start, idea strict national lockdown freaked hell (like Spain, France, etc.) looking back wish would have. course lack adequate social safety net like European countries, lot rules (crowd limits, etc.) ended merely suggestions...especially things opening back up. 

I’m typically quite anti-police involvement...but wish enforced things better. seemed enforce curfews quite seriously protests, much March April quarantine though. also wish would’ve sort rules (that actually enforced) regarding crossing state lines, since state left make rules. 

Anyways, curious others think should’ve done differently...specifically first two months pandemic?????? We're going try district doubt last long. 1,000 employees we're huge lots taking seriously pandemic school nurse time thought hoax. Also many employees live outside district even neighbooring state sure refuse stay home unless going necessary things like groceries. talking kids knows exposed home way going social distance. Also even social distance wear masks going nagging continulsly make sure keep guidelines. Parents area seem favor masks anyways going vocal enforce legally probably can't deny student education even refuse mask. Also teachers students die complications kids going shut down. think important whatever need feel safe. live southern Sweden seen single mask. go Denmark weekly basis seen single mask either. infection rates low dropping.
I would never dream judging someone wearing mask. situations masks great. problem people judge others wearing mask, giving shit effective ways stay safe. don’t know you’re downvoted. exact psychology go deep enough. course, don’t realize what’s driving behavior. many ways pandemic revealing worldwide mental health crisis.

Agreed. Trump exhibited throughout time president. Hello fellow CNY person! Fair cancelled today. online classes probably. exactly like fire bus Mexicans scab ""rick6787"" Yep. worldwide problem. worked cruises.

In certain locations may indeed tenable open schools, others might. teachers considered. Children, especially still within formative years cognitive social development must also considered. loss may 1:1.
 
This virus us unless effective treatment and/or vaccine implemented - **and may never happen**.
 
So comes individual risk assessment given period time. may consider near term immediate effects. Others may choose consider primary, 2nd 3rd order consequences longer time period.
 
What wrong assuming anyone sees differently - seemingly even smallest margins - somehow possesses ill intent operating good faith. Ah OPs alias! Welcome!

Btw: really helping comments either?! Plus, OP complaining getting brigaded think depends where.
I'm Montreal, city 1/4 countries cases 1/33rd population. anything would expect lots masks here....not much. work mall see less less masks everyday concerning Car accidents viral, usually. meme spoof commercial Butt Crumpler, idea. Ok. could previous post true? Hold Upoutine? That’s March, exceeded Spain’s death toll restarting widespread economic activities. mean, sucks we’re heavily dependent manufacturing jobs people literally decide dying COVID starving/ getting evicted. However, Governor Mexico City scientific background quite responsible implementing measures. That’s mean though, clearly can’t manage open bars restaurants, well schools. Experts said make choice regard, already made choice. spread hand now, schools won’t option. Even want try, shutting almost immediately anyway cost much regard PPE usage. set return school 25 days...not happening, they’re still waiting let people know make us even ill prepared remote teaching. fact we’re even entertaining going back unprepared scary.

Im US. moving states car. places use bathroom least risk catching virus? Im hearing public restrooms toilet sears definite no. We’re even halfway done winning Literally last 15 years August going very, bad Florida. hope rest states get things together enough send help cause going need it.

If Governor admits needs accepts. Pray people trying stay safe here.  Testing seems well executed available area. specifically addition current testing protocols? either know cannot actually understand fact actions impact people.

They know care. best care. actually believe good thing people older generations die sooner. figured virus affects point death others little symptoms cured week 2? uncle asymptomatic kid school positive trip florida worst part far runny nose.

Yep! I've ear infection 4 months. Maybe Dec get treated Laughs long term depression Daily antibody shots Ok. Understood. retract comment. studies useless. incubation period week. possibly perform study like incubation period?

Those called “studies” make mockery science political gain. don’t need study find people large groups close other, lot without masks, chanting, lead increase Coronavirus cases. brought thread. people mental disabilities may keep mask face sure caregivers supposed do? Since 2016 foreign heads state *should* dealt Trump terse, official statements handled office staff. 
No person meetings. photo ops. 
Trump nakedly obvious TV hype man more. Angela Merkel could weekend-long summit Trump think they’ve worked bunch plans, Trump’s one takeaway would “I got picture needed Germany lady.” That’s it. Nothing political it. said human deserves punch mouth hypicrital approach global pandemic happens idiot position power. relevant person question enforcing rules breaking himself. stood front Canadians said stay home dont travel, left cottage hours away weekend. Meanwhile family charged $880 breaking quarantine rules rollerblading bike path together. test results processed doesn’t really happen Sunday.

The tests results 3-10 days delayed depending lab. Damn Grandad didnt kill him! Doubt letting happen

He far know. know kind test is, almost certain he's getting it. 

Don't fooled, probably terrified getting it. “I don’t want visit shithole country” shows ridiculous time live in. apologies. fast enough appear statistics yet meant. secret service guys would snipe fly gets close president. Anyone gets close gets tested least daily. want tests rest us thinks makes numbers look bad, mandates tons tons tests protect himself. I'm convinced contracted mild case disease mid March. believe second week daily Covid conferences noticed change behavior. appeared sluggish, drained, normal. seemed push it, normally does, there's official confirmation contracted disease. 

However, signs. learn disease, pervasive long-trrm effects seem be. displayed problems balance speech, seems easily winded recently. would evident long-term cardiovacular damage disease. 

It's probably nothing, though. I'm guy internet, he's old man. meant someone infected vaping, vapor likely carry virus standard cigarette/breath would. vapour pure moisture. /r/notopbutok Honestly really pay attention celebrity news maybe? know. heard Keanu Reeves nice guy too. Maybe? SARS1 higher death rate, immediately noticeable people worked faster contain it, people feared cooperation. important differences like pres-ymptomatic transmission (which SARS1 lacked), possible deadly disease would easier control. Gonna stimulate weed dealer😎 So? It'd 2020 Trump get it, entirely asymptomatic throughout, go around saying ""I it, big deal, I'm proof!""  probably migraines. wear masks inside air conditioned. can't wear outside heat long without triggering migraine. keep distance outside wear inside. wearing outside minute getting migraine worth it. Urgh. parents attend streaming church PJs cell immunity probably offers enough protection prevent fatal second cases

Is evidence true? Possibly... though hospitalizations correspondingly areas. 

Treatments improved one would expect mortality drop, people live, otherwise would died... better? seriously messed permanent disabilities? Probably mix. Herd immunity natural cause, vaccination would wonder way encourage countries destroy samples xD moved AZ (not choice) depressed see people like here. hot balls outside think everyone would still okay hanging homes anyway....people seriously flocked random-ass stores could shop somewhere store's website, people making fun 6ft rule...bitching wear masks fat-ass faces can't shove faces full crap food beer right away instead wait ten minutes get home. Seriously, people neighborhood Facebook bitching able eat food restaurant like much different eating sitting table...I mean hecking Arizona, they're usually talking local Chilis upscale restaurant. messed up. miss old city can't tell lol. doesn’t necessarily need something ride (spit, mucous), it? difference airborne aersolized? long local environments cared long pretty places far away countries. sarcasm. US citizen, honestly sucks. State(PA) full lockdown order 3 months depending lived states, 3 months stay inside, time states able go whatever, states going ruin states actually took measures. I’m teacher scares crap me. I’m high risk toddler. I’d 10000% rather teach home toddler risk infection going back. can’t reconcile US’s CFR much lower UK, Italy, Spain, France. everything wrong according world. death rate low testing fraction right peak infection. IMHE model estimates real infections peaked 249,325 US infections per day March 29th. Testing near perfect much better (102,052 tests 3/29 vs \~585,000 7/5) giving better idea many infections really there. light mortality rate much better peak. Also leaves open door truly staggering numbers days come. Thay last point good. believe God really think made sun, water, clean air, healthy food nothing? God see reason would save choose eat deep fried food sit inside day. you’re saying tall immune? Interesting. doesn’t matter opinion have. Constitution prevents it. that’s reality whether comprehend That's I'm confused trouble articulating (as well places). 100% agree premise, think likely US poor job responding containing virus. 

I'm *absolutely* pushing sort ""see, America bad!"" narrative - dropped ball immensely, obviously. I'm still looking explanation US getting hit harder despite things would gladly wish getting weaker - however evolving (apparently unusual viruses so). medical interventions getting effective learn more, hopefully save many lives. Nazi's bad Americans good? racism? due Jews? due Nazi's invading France? 

Look, 1940s, US subjugated Black people. barely allowed fight WW2. US extremely racist put Japanese people internment camps. 

The US chance let Jews country murdered. US refused (along many countries) want many Jewish immigrants. Hence ultimately killed final solution.

In words, US give fuck concentration camps war. used reason validate atrocities performed war. 

The big reason WW2 fought ""Nazis bad, must stop Nazis."" That's narrative part propaganda narrative formed afterwards. real reason fought WW2 power grab USA build new empire. 

It fucking power grab. Pure simple. 

And go ""cool shit happened war."" Yeah... Okay. That's soldier worship stuff. know soldiers do? kill lot. Civilians. soldiers. torture. rape. lose lot ""I'm good person"" humanity. Many die many mortally wounded. lucky ones survive deal guilt war. look actual interviews soldiers fought WW2, usually guilty ashamed war. interviews different people something proud of, like building business winning Olympic gold medal. 

When start seeing WW2 lens performing power grab, like Nazis, like Russians, like Japanese, puts war perspective. noble saviors. shitty people better position win war others. US wrote war history declared us noble ones.

My biggest problem WW2 worship dishonest. fucked war. One young people traded borders power. winners make us saints. that's lie find discomforting. they're sick they're bringing contagion workplace. understand this?  story country much talk except bullshit NYT day professors ""revolting"" going back classroom. University boards full boomer investors making horrible decisions. people survive cancer/influenza others don’t? Every individual different Microbiome immune system.  put iPad top mannequin. 2020 suck dick. far worst year life, hope gets better here. vaccine know about. Wow, Garth Brooks asked sniper declined. cant see anyone Barry Pepper playing role. got feeling uuuuuuu uuuuuuuuuuuu Like 4 July party mask close gatherings? Yea stfu. Man face man knows wife hates him... Idk lol. Wait till anti-maskers hear dihydrogen monoxide. fucking causes asphyxiation fluid buildup lungs. Nasty substance we're literally *surrounded* it! Depends, community colleges enrollment way, way That’s appeal authority.

Correct. know think kind gotcha, *especially* trying champion peer review. expert submits article peer review, journal sends *other experts*. people signed letter probably peer reviewed other's papers. Maybe understand that. Fuck rules. Half posts sub get locked. Mods realize Coronavirus deeply connected politics point. half? many sure, enough let virus rampage population, I'd like see statistics many people is, ""half country"" seems like wildly innaccurate guess. think reasonable guess non zero percentage, probably less 15%. infectious is, that's still enough fuck everything up. ""half country"" random statement makes point without relying facts. every single one Yeah Quebec doesn’t much leg stand tho. play cry bully tactic much disproportionate amount sway parliament 
edit: grammar able work home either. anything, seeing everyone enjoying time stressing little bit. I'm never going able take much time retire. virus freaking weird. enrollment way there's plenty room downsize faculty too.

Ok, thanks moving goalposts. enrollment down? clue Parliament system works. 

Like know vague tidbits. 

So I'm guessing Trudeau's party sizable number seats plurality enough seats gain majority I'm guessing form coalition parties? 

Is anywhere close? Opinion piece. Smart. Pennsylvania Ave def epicenter point. hyperbole. Right wing Canadians hate Trudeau, yes, nowhere near hatred fear left wing Americans hate Trump. Excellent- thankfully leader actually brain. Dump trump 2020. Ah yes Trump virus. makes everyone look like carrot. Angles Schmangles; literally air-kiss-both-cheeks smoochy-smoochy thing people sometimes do, though. Ireland done great job controlling this. reopening fantastic too. Finally eat restaurants. long people don’t get carried away Ireland doesn’t let many people, takes precautions normal everyday life. tests, find cases. Shocking, really can't figure out. need reminded comment mid next year hope right. 


RemindMe! 1 year Nope two DMs. more, aren’t, post proof. Otherwise stfu. Coronavirus kills eating away Vital Energy^^TM, Trump foresaw preparing entire life exercising fat slob. Hug Ruskie, too. Scientific literacy isn’t issue. People well educated risks education doesn’t mean they’ll change behavior. whatever reasons people want consequences dammed.    fatality rate 4.4%. steadily (if slowly) declining almost three months now, marginal (daily) rate mid 1's, weekdays low 1's.

I wish could celebrate incredibly huge number still horrendous.  

I realize people understand numbers, that's another huge problem have, fatality rates like flu acceptable functioning society long case counts high growing exponentially. Thank you. know plutonium sounded wrong don’t know polonium. He's wrong. Trudeau handles Covid like pro he's certainly perfect Prime Minister. Marching protests meant force power make meaningful change like ""I know guys, going something?"". Plus forgotten broken promise election reform got elected first time. Wednesday Washington? least Trudeau still power.

Do editors proofread wasting time using syntax grammar?

Why waste time using lot word word trick? Wait minute. 
So people using seatbelt car wearing safety harness working high place wearing hurt/kill you, order avoid deal emotion fear one wearing seatbelt/ safety harness ? still ""fizzing"" face i'm beginning believe never go away.

Firstly—I'm sorry hear that.

Would mind expounding upon ""fizzing"" face feels like?  able turn invitations often life wish 

* CDC honest PPE needing saved Frontline workers encouraged selfless behavior 
* Federal govt unified depts trying protect us, provided infrastructure mandates coordination contract tracing across levels govt. 
* months denial top, maybe Americans warned prepare pandemic hit shores people authority could made difference still lot contact-tracing epidemiological evidence suggest infection probability drops quickly distance spreader. Like, see pretty clearly well traced spreading events restaurants airplanes. see situations appears ""airborne"" spread infected person left area some, people. 
 
Personally, think going learn lot confounding issue explainable surface cross contamination. droplets land elevator button remain infectious much longer droplets aerosols stay air. touch anything (your phone, mask, pocket, etc) washing hands, contaminated. someone touch elevator button fine, seems explain variability ""plausibly airborne"" scenarios terms people get infected others not. That's article. think answer none, article would mentioned it. I'm sure said (and downvoting you). understand supposed focus public health information, indeed difficult talk disease without recognizing politicized is. speak personal experience coronavirus responses Canada vs. US, say anything country's two leaders outside (at least subreddit suppose).  Oh Canada? like go Canada!

I'll see out. read article, they’re already sending people San Diego Albuquerque. pretty shitty sub general. shared zero profit model Astrazenca. again, cure things piles piles cash  keeps coming up, popular vote gap really matter scheme things, especially gap continues grow urban metro tier 1 areas. 

It like playing best series 50 (states)rounds. matter big wins are, matters losses are. 

This coming election, Trump could lose much 12 million votes, actual odds might decrease all, majority new-ish votes come California Chicago, cities. Case-in-point: McConnell.  could say theres downard trajectory probably whole month now, exactly like government chooses report it, would technically true relative spike April, suddenly isnt. suddenly people wondering back death rates we've seen worse, point is, *downplaying* current cases, positivity rates DEATHS LAG 3-4 WEEKS BEHIND INFECTIONS right we're worse regard April. Awe, ol' reddit, ""cant argue point I'll downvote make personal attacks based wild assumptioms."" 

Good job, u proven soundness points made country proud.  ...i think ? different denominations dont make different religions, especially islam. 

and case irish goes far deeper that. [Covid parties directly touch implications articles outside safe thought. 

For instance: 

""airborne transmission refers presence extremely small particles remain air long periods time transmitted others distances greater one meter.""

If air matter inside outside. Yes, still poses threat inside air conditioning systems recycling air. However, smell neighbor cooking BBQ get Covid them. said 6 foot rule person person contact airborne outside wouldnt considered safe (or least safe originally implied).

Edit: would like different article says information directly see find. new news like yesterday. see coming weeks. actual medical reason wear mask.... know woman lung transplant even pandemic thing, wear face mask safety. ruin ability breath.

Amazing right, masks designed allow go breathe keeping dangerous small objects out. almost like we're living 21st century something give cite? Honestly. best thing could h poen bring wife pass rona trump.

If analysis begins ends we're part problem.  Cool basketball anecdote. Care actually explain though? Cant wear masks?

Yeah I've playing around pretty surprising: going back time, preventative behaviors (mask-wearing, avoiding crowds, avoiding large gatherings) US really much worse combination France, Germany, UK. individual ones better categories (ie UK much better job distancing), they're dreadful categories (the UK horrendous usage masks - much, much worse US).

Right lockdown ended saw people certain popular hiking spots ever before... still like 50 people summit wide enough social distance easily. try stick less popular trails initially, scientists experts started saying contamination risks low outdoors, long people keeping distance other.

Oh well. Four hospitals ran beds. I'm CDC director favorite gimmick account subreddit Canada hospitals COVID-19 patients.

In USA COVID-19 patients hospitals. using term indicate resistance vaccinated new vaccine. anti-vaxxers typical meaning term, agree. least plan stop spread, oh wait..... COVID caused ventilators Define ""true"".

It's reported, but:

* Many places test weekend
* major holiday weekend
* Many places (Los Angeles) report
* Many places deliberately misclassifying deaths ""pneumonia"" rather COVID-19.

It's true, accurate. Yeah numbers set stone eternity...  getting 30K cases day barely tests. estimated saw numbers higher back March April. follow news. Imagine driving border lol, drive shame back home family screaming  Technically Columbia Health, yeah. actions changed company quite bit. Everyone gets ""look"" face he's brought up. 55 miles east Dallas...to sum county (Hunt) pending lawsuit sorts positive person refused stay quarantine willingly spreading around. So, there's that. mean ""USA, hold Corona."" Yep, guys staying get shit figured Dislike reply? I'm many sides point whoever hates polygons bigger square fucking clue I'm talking about. cant test potential cases isolate positives never slow thing without lockdown.

The first part headline neatly dovetails second part lmao NZ: Copy cats. Glad see this. hoping state Florida grows damn brain sometime die.

I hate even joke. I've many comments sub deleted. get want get R/D pissing match, there's happy medium refusing acknowledge allow discussion societal aspect pandemic (the politics) that's ***clearly*** exacerbating it. Bwah ha ha. Whatever. guarantee least decade schooling training you. sure, go find mechanical/chemical/materials engineer go ask well cotton filters micron sized particles. Go ahead, dare you! already know answer. stayed home watched Netflix. neighborhood least fireworks went off?🤷‍♀️ saw many friends fb partied without masks though Bars strip clubs seem causing lot virus spread. good place right now. Considering Florida scientists fired refusing falsify data... surprise me. Worth it. would great thing didn’t see record breaking surges U.S .. Sad say numbers way different 3 weeks. notice window! tip tonsil stones? (*Baaarf!* still gag think that!) haven’t looked much detail. I’m going I’ve heard data model makers say they’re interviewed various podcasts. 538 good interview IHME folks you’re interested stuff like this. don’t know talked reporting rates episode, think come either podcast Corona Virus Daily. 

That said, see weekends represented lot covid models states / counties. You’ll see dip around end week spike start week. There’s even Dollop episode it. Oh makes sad. thought unlikely would pull complications, hoping. I'm sorry wife child. I'm fking heartbroken wife Amanda baby. never get see grow UNFCKINGFAIR world!!! was/am emotionally invested family since beginning April. amazing attitude life huge inspiration me, can't even imagine pain right foreseeable future... hope gentle coming days months, time heal... maybe take L move ITT: ages matter. one found direct like eating bat animal market first cases. Sure, see below.  bot definitely anti-""free speech"" receive text answered it. hope survive too. I'm sorry Canadian border closed completely understand. Dr Acton predicted would get 117,000 through. Since mask law, think she'll right some. holiday weekend I'd feel better - congrats nonetheless. Ok.... Bro roughly many people surrounding Toronto area Chicagoland. Good you. normal people miserable age sick shit. RIP Nick. :( parents essentially forcing come vacation Yellowstone. basically accept fact I’ll likely contract virus? anyone know anything contagion airplanes? do? Thanks much hope! You’re good person. Really needed read wrote literally right now. Thank YOU. Apparently, BLM protests led (significant?) infection spikes, things *highly* masked. prove effectiveness wearing masks viral pandemic! They're behind almost every nation almost laughable. completely preventable loss human lives complete opposite story Florida. lychees you? Great post, well done. :( No, they're saying overall deaths 122,000 higher historical average months, 28% higher number reported COVID-19 deaths. math (122,000 / 1.28), 95,300 ppl died COVID-19 March 1to May 30, sounds right. that's 27,000 deaths reported, 3 months. guarantee thousands January/February even know though. maybe skewing data? Well, I'm likely wrong, if, small chance, I'm correct, God bless America… People angry something. many people read article? That’s worries people see headline pass them, they’ve completely misinformed false title. Got it. missed meant indoors shop. course that's possible, steam room, artificial environments. possible outdoors nature.

The record dew point 95 Saudi Arabia, temp 108 humidity 65%. that's highest ever recorded. 90 degrees 90% humidity literally never recorded US, temps rise, relative humidity falls. one meteorologist posted wrote may happened Wisconsin, recorded such. morning 10 90 degrees 89% humidity. heat index 119. 5 PM, temp climbed 101 heat index 142, relative humidity dropped 66%.

In Melbourne, FL got 95 degrees 88% humidity. that's record, happen routinely. Yesterday 89 degrees 70% humidity there. muggiest place could find US far year. Yep begging Dad lives Texas wear mask...stupid Fox News trash. yes ok killing people economy Feel free immediately downvote people skeptical vaccine ""anti-vaxxer"" stop straw manning legitimate concerns. live BC mask usage well 50% we’ve done better province. think masks less important staying away following social distancing guidelines. Canadians generally pretty good following directions trusting science... think biggest advantage compared US. Happy cake day  front page sub makes virus Black Plague. Wearing thin cloth masks going packed protests stores probably won’t effective preventing spread. trend deaths follows countries hit hard virus, we’ll hopefully closer fully opening month two. Mandating cloth masks far along probably security theater play instead effective way contain virus. Yeah USA everything completely control. comparing country 300 million people country smaller size California population leader issue country lol maybe Covid kill even underlying condition people need keep taking seriously. Thank you. love username! Safer school where? COVID ward hospital? Los Angeles reporting holiday weekend. no... want appear know better smart... still make sacrifices.

like sister .. currently abusing work home status literally drive around country visit relatives use living rooms day work remotely.

I know pieces shit think .. grew one.

they worse covid deniers least covid deniers... know right away stay away them. Everything fine. Everyone great. national leadership spectacular. people exemplary. 

I'm happy. happy too? hope so. world sunny bright filled happiness rainbows!

No mistakes made. Everything fine.

You're great mod. I'm happy here. hope splendid day. you? everything grand everyone right rain, everyday! country mind asking true reported number lowest since March. ton factors might contribute this: reporting always low weekends, may even lower holiday weekends. addition, treatment methods gotten better less people dying. Theres also initial speculation current strain thats going around might little less severe (havent seen solid proof though!) probably combination factors. well friend! that’s enforceable... I’d get vaccine say, Spain Germany came it. I’m taking shitty rushed MAGA vaccine. wouldn’t put past administration rush fudge results I’m taking risk. Big Gretch put work. let’s hope things stay relatively calm. didn’t hesitate close bars, don’t think she’d hesitate add additional restrictions needed unlike governors. could see it. Hell refuse Believe Trump Pence they've disappeared public eye time Username checks out.

Still want apology media? really get difficult find middle ground though. much discuss impact BLM protests exacerbating vs mask flouting vs big box stores staying open local stores closing? troll account. know Puss(es make another account say really feel? truth buried. US, room COVID-19 patients ICU. ? nothing defying order. restrictions area already lifted. try coerce either, threat involved. Fucking propaganda man. shit irks me. thing us would done trying move front line.. ""hey man know am""... Could wake one day COVID 19 vanishes? read news article researcher claiming COVID may originated China possible virus everywhere waiting right ""enviromental"" conditions spread. One conditions temps needed around 4 C. ideal place would meat processing plants. Specifically meat processing plants toilets virus could aerosol-ed spread quickly president lead example.

Well...he that. He's leading non-mask usage politicizing mask usage example.

When Trump could done opposite. 

Well, honest, Trump have. He's capable that. within personality think situation affects him. Fuck. don’t really social media anymore google tab would refresh daily him. sad.

My condolences Amanda Elvis. ❤️ Show statistics lifelong disability (or even long lasting effects) cherry picked outliers subreddit I’d likely agree you. would take virus seriously people didn’t support massive outdoor protests two weeks jump back gloom doom coronavirus protests ended. joke take virus seriously protests widely supported. /s ? virus exposed much corruption it’s sort amusing showing 760 per day U.S. August. Nobody arguing things going get bad April. CA healthcare worker here. Death one side effect many cases. hospital especially ICU full, expect hospitals capacity give limb, vision, life-saving care non-covid conditions. example, cancer diagnoses falling, restaurants proposition 65 signs meats closed will.

I hope stay safe. Please acknowledge want available bed hospital ever needed it. It’s surely they’re testing more. Anyone common sense could tell positivity rate goes increase sample size Exactly I’m hurry! Wow, nice hear good news US once. Still hoping states though, looks absolutely scary. Unpaid. Ebola deadly flu, flu still infectious far likely cause death. strain may kill people quickly easily spreads, deadliness stays same. Agreed. good news skepticism. Still good hear. choose exactly slavery increase outbreaks. untested unknowingly spread it. states legitimately reporting recovery rate vastly undercounting many people recovered virus. Read South Korea patients.

They support relapses, reinfections sad true lol

The last time sick early March. Partner brought covid home abroad. though ill end September Feb ish anything everything germ spreader brought home.

We opted ending school year (at least person) early honestly, since then, nothing. cough. cold. Nothing.

I remember last time we've healthy long since started kids lol God, poor man. really fought hard.

Meanwhile 41 year olds town frightened BLM protestors murdering beds. joke - they’re posting local FB group this. y’know, that’s totally happening aaaall America. virus here. fictional boogeyman.

We screwed. Someone wake up, I’m still dreaming. death rate blacks higher? already stage plus abscesses wazoo pain every time try eat. already looked around get fixed cuz current dentist accept insurance hardly luck. issues way pandemic. hate think bad coronavirus hit body already severe infections dealing with. know sounds silly I've following story months. ups downs, struggles family doctors. kind long shot, young healthy prime life guess always hope. F*CK COVID people deny it. ""Compared January February averages, diabetes deaths rose 96 percent states. Deaths tied heart disease (89%), Alzheimer’s disease (64%), stroke (35%) also saw disturbing jumps. study adds deaths New York City due heart disease diabetes rose 350 percent time.""

From I've[ COVID-19 damages heart kidneys cause blood clots (which lead stroke). maybe covid-associated deaths counted. fact people IRL went way everything possible spread virus even more(throwing parties, making masks political etc) something neither movie predicted.  exactly slavery choose there. wouldn’t say all! working. from? Magic 8 Ball says ""Yes!"" It’s safe predictable round 1 fight.  think understand read single thing posted. **Covid US, according CDC, getting close losing pandemic status. Let sink in.** Every college local health departments, literally send people get tested whatever day get last results  Mostly 2 - 3 4 week lag cases deaths. hospitals getting overrun, reduce care, increase fatalities even further. fucked idea hospital space anyway.

""No worries, tube shove lungs ready right here! Go enjoy night town!"" S.M.R.T... mean, S.M.A.R.T. That's end immunity though No, heard done animals.

His doctors thought symptoms consistent covid-19, kept testing him. Frankly, I'm going trust medical professionals you. Sorry. found research way indicate “Achilles heel” treatment. (I’m medical doctor). wording clickbait. I’m not.

Hear here.

At peak New York’s infection amount daily deaths now. it’s leveled off. 

As long heroic doctors nurses keep selflessly throwing virus go care it. Well fingers crossed 100,000 new cases past two weeks don’t catch us. Also hoping young people don’t start shopping department stores, Buick dealerships. Honestly new Corvette really concerned, awful time American sports car start appeal 55 crowd.   \*taps temple finger\* 

""Can't hospitalizations beds..."" commenters need stop dramatic. malicious undercounting confirm yet.

The states undercounting ones hit earliest got hold situation. Aside states excess mortality numbers well line.

Would nice updated data can't find any, lines dates per 
posted study. accurate tests? Maybe i'm missing mean...We reached herd immunity others developing VACCINE... herd immunity well...AFTER vaccine developed. 

Pre vaccine nearly kids got measles look damage even small outbreaks do. even talking human lives, economic damage alone. Compare cost wearing mask. small thing huge effect. Stop crushing head! first happened thought might push that. look like now, especially ""rushed"" vaccine. There's probably going order operations. remember H1N1 vaccine finally released ""high risk"" groups (I believe geriatric pediatric H1N1) first. likely COVID-19 it'll high risk individuals comorbidities, 60+ age group, healthcare professionals. I'm expecting US gets access drug year's end, rest general pop may get access like April. bad considering timelines told March.  smartest move make, hope universities online option classes. kids want go campus first year experience (not smartest move imo), helps crowd. students want go campus, option helps them. decision overall mitigates spread, placates really want person activities.

Also, I'm pretty sure Harvard 100% need based aid, tuition exactly 50k anyway. hope universities pay attention Harvard/Princeton change 2020-2021 academic plans accordingly.  part union could sort coordinated, central response always wonder whether asymptomatic carrier earlier year.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm happy hear good news! wish best! Add pile stupid things he's said pandemic far. So... new Covidland then? wrong people. evil trick devil ever played man. Convincing people god different beings. Tom Hanks blood thinners cause bruising. entire point initial lockdown example many EU countries: keep number patients manageable hospital care sufficient supply. Netherlands, turned possibility increasing number ICU beds quite limited, even cost problem - there's shortage ICU nurses normal times, let alone pandemic.

So 'ramping capacity' always pipe dream (or right lie) we're talking high percentage extra ICU beds. goes country even money play role.

And even increased amount ICU beds, exponential growth going max too. Florida example growing number active cases 5% per day roughly. means going 200k 300k active cases WEEK. seeing almost effort made stop infections spreading, sooner later hospital capacity going give even extra ICU beds. totally missed point It’s still highly misleading regardless, extra misleading dots centred bumfuck nowhere point I’m making, ok. Describing bad experience using example it’s like flu ridiculous, flu cause experiences - it’s reported. could frustrating: ""please enter billing information $50/mo subscription fee"" Well, makes sense add much capacity send patients hospitals also stopping elective surgery discharge surgical patients without replacing them. 🤨 proactive testing general public anywhere US? understanding would still need voluntarily go get tested see virus. automatically excludes asymptomatic/naturally immune people probably people mild symptoms feel bothered realize covid. Extra testing catch people.  research nearly comprehensive New York’s antibody testing was. 

That would study tracked population antibody percentage time earth quotes around word crisis? That's fact, opinion meshes well observation secondary attack rate within families living single residence single infected family member around 20%.

It seems people capable spreading easily lot, many others far less likely spread infection. getting reports _possible_ reinfections since February. find several well documented cases _probable_ reinfection would news. pretty fucking stupid people actually believed president. internet fingertips. research find what’s really going people would rather take idiots advice ‘merica fam MN says mask compliance grocery store like 30-50%, true? so, yall doomed Well can't really extrapolate exponential growth long want, even action growth rate starts slowing point. question long takes. Things downtrend, yes. never stabilized safe rate. downtrend very, likely trend back scenario (not disease cases). Gah.... paywall Hey make couple claims curious about. could show shown virus doesn’t stay surfaces? Additionally, since believe Stay-At-Home orders don’t work suggest? IMO one strict lock would better a""triple lock down"", well yeah clue could practical city cuz strict lock means huge affect ppl’s normal lives especially poors.

However good luck n pray ppl suffering this. depends hard lockdown do. wimpy ass one sure, however, like Ontario closed almost everything, peaked 3 weeks like OP said. 100% agree. think issue people trying resist education either financial reasons, p*litical disagreement, bunch reasons. that's said system flawed. Education never grades, status, job opportunities ideology warfare. always grounded learning knowledge. Deaths count test. Taps nose, wink. *puts Walmart bag head* Omg can’t breath. Thanks Obama! US split two countries. One wants public health care one wants current system. guess move isolate stupid people want live. Sorry sad see title, shall ""not late made masks compulsory"".

It time, late put politics , trade-war ,calculations, races, religious, war asides , focus virus... Also, lot cities countries built around horses public transportation whereas American cities young, built around cars. Condolences family friends💔

My husband lost relative due coronavirus reminder real. Recently read trauma individuals ventilators experience extreme panic , depression ,confusion pain. hope comfort longer suffering.

I'm still iny 30s created living will/advance healthcare directive. hope make easier family . will... spread slower? Infect fewer people? overwhelm healthcare system leading people dying complications wouldn’t originally died access treatment options weren’t overwhelmed? Either troll man ignorant. 

You’d certainly convince people making legal requirement punishable fines jail time. can’t ‘cause muh freedom. Ah. Got it. Yeah I’m seeing People’s article little unclear that. I’m NM. People rabidly refuse comply (and businesses refusing enforce) pissing off. Gov put place $100 fine - sure how/if effectively enforced either. 200 ICU beds California total? Can’t Glad help! may add something, creative. old home didnt chin bar reverse rows dining table. luckily heafty flip me. also used two sturdy chairs horses lift bodyweight sholders really work serratus. (Little finger like muscles chest abs.) Focus really feels like activates muscle groups want, drop exercises aren't. bulk like Arnold, go places like! 27 days ago June 8.

Three weeks prior Memorial Day.  Right still began China. caused kidding ive saying covid wild card test body - matter fit think might be.....You cant 100% certain. people say im full shit...... show source others lost limb due virus? I’m genuinely curious. again.. except time looks like idiot possibly believe person hates shit mask wears anyway they're god damn asshole. can't see fucking virus first all. whoever dolt probably name virus actual name.

The idiots want ONE side primitive fuck. Let show sides open palm.. want reality check FIRST.. backhand forehand?
Should slap mask on? mask off? 

Just fall hole already. Damn it. . . 

I pretend like huge fan. I've never seen perform anything. heard story months ago. really hoping he'd pull through. young child fairly recent marriage. much live for. horrible.

RIP Nick Wow that's tragic. Thanks info. Seems blood clots mysterious nasty complication showing considerable amount COVID patients. upcoming first year UGA, one universities putting proper measures place, gonna shot show firs year. can't tell sarcasm. true tests mean positive results, covid starting decreasing see % positive stay decrease, % positive going well, indicating infection rate increasing. 

Florida's percent positive doubled last month, pushing close 20% 7/2. That's 1 5 infected. doesn’t, still thinks geneeus see useless distinction, yes. ""American Africans"". That's new, guess accurate? sure. God caused bat judging. saying truly, even tests, IDEA COVID going you, long term. 6 months ago everyone ""knew"" confined China. 4 months ago, everyone ""knew"" lung disorder. 2 months ago, everyone ""knew"" affected big cities coasts, could pick groceries. Now, people ""know"" COVID affects blood vessels causes massive immune responses kids. 

Six months now, know??? terrible. relax think tell discover flus like time, good thing anything study find vaccine sooner reality probably since people infected. US really bad tracking recoveries. original tone implied it. Trump comes tomorrow says vaccine exactly ask, would sceptical?

It fun see party lines divide vaccines. literally could go left right. interesting. 6 days? Hah. cousin waiting 2 weeks now. would expect case, fact hold true lot countries.  University Louisville required masks testing isn’t required flu shot “recommended”. 4 5 classes fall announced remote learning week email saying would 40% classes remote. Definitely lied number. raising tuition little said. great! Florida concerned predicted busy hurricane season. Ehh looked data referring deaths look pretty scattered since end March pandemic really set TX. Looks like we've 25-30ish deaths per day avg since way back late March. 1 2 days 40+ deaths statistically significant especially proceeded low death days. week begins week 3 since spike new cases began June 15th finally real view seriousness terms fatality rate week Thank you. exclusion-not mention dismantling whole obamacare-is pushed converse, terrified, well aware truth Covid. Georgia tech decides e-learning, guessing Georgia tech little trouble finding students want pay tuition. track recoveries more. US barely tracks them. Yeah, exactly- Slippin' Jimmy Houston.  Yeah, there's reason degrees value. universities get accredited. There's certain floor quality information keep accreditation teachers required PhD subject they're teaching.

It's simple people learn things own. Professors academic departments lot work teach information decide *what* teach. Knowing know actually useful learn hardest part self-learning IMO. One could argue universities always great job teaching students useful information, think system pretty good track record whole. People mishandling bats caused Covid Japan population growth problem. Coming soon US too. thing is, going devastate Florida economy. Think it. get majority income tourists considering state income tax. However, virus control like this, states mandate must quarantine 2 weeks coming hot spot state (like FL). 

Who's going go vacation hotspot risk getting infected still quarantine additional 2 weeks returning home? People going show even remain profitable certain point? sustainable Ron knows that. point, probably knows he's fucked he's probably praying miracle. reccomend done based news? Already tried asking, that’s I’m here. development distribution vaccine (say) 4 years considered fast, that’s safe proven effective.

There many viruses vaccines despite decades research testing, example, HIV.

Being annoyed kind touch reality vaccine development.

This study involved 45 subjects peer reviewed. 45 woefully inadequate sample size. glimmer hope, still far cry useable vaccine. also don’t know viable antibodies means long term (as virus likely seasonal), results reproduced across different demographic groups. don’t know really hit gave bit hope. Thank you. Yep. feel like I’m living different Toronto people. I’m seeing things strictly enforced I’m also seeing many masks area all. Scott Oneil runs part sixers taught norm assholes. pretty much leaves one option....vaccinate willing wait rest infected reach herd immunity. Amazing. world needs take lessons Canada. friend condo Madeira Gulf Blvd still packed. Ate Dockside Dave’s mask order even staff wasn’t wearing them. Johns Pass completely packed. Went Siesta Key well village pretty insane. 45 minute wait Daiquiri Deck SKOB. Pinellas hotels pretty much capacity weekend even fireworks counts hate speech white people protests Fair enough.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* responses clearly acknowledge may completely talking asses, first all. let’s say instead beds said, ventilators, medication, staffing, equipment. mean they're imprisoned will, unpaid... might well land chance repatriated / deported back home. really understand difficult. Countries take citizens home quarantine 14 days. Like, really - complicated? fired this. time would ask company plans COVID told keep working. 2 confirmed cases building one time one guy severe enough ventilator.  Well arrive work knowing company tell anything. opened email message department head ONE supposed building unless mission essential area cleaned.  call supervisor ( teleworking) let know email. told stay put apply me. 

Then shit show started, practice social distancing many departments went alternative schedules sudden except me. order job need specific departments onsite. client support starts complaining taking long complete customer requests. inform what's going ( even though knew alternative schedules departments on) complain company manger saying work performance poor, take job seriously. next day get signed termination paper company president, stating poor job performance communication, turn things immediately.

I filed unemployment 2 months company claiming misconduct. I've yet receive anything unemployment deputy looks case.

This first time I've ever fired job honestly point want go back work force. I'm trying become freelancer. experiences never want put life someone else's hand again. Carlson that. fact traveled Trump birthday party specifically call idiot this, late February. test Fox shit. Eh Holiday weekend reporting always lower average weekend reporting. However test positivity rate seems stabilizing possibly decreasing slightly Arizona. Maybe folk finally starting get message. rate count herd immunity end year saw couple without masks walk past cop standing next sign said masks mandatory grocery store WA yesterday. Probably 90% mask usage inside store, distancing. Forgot say pulse oximeter life saver. helped figure whether winded, anxiety attack, actually low oxygen. Luckily oxygen dipped 94 short period stayed rest time using inahler. I'd lay like this, people protesting (for valid cause) make relatively small portion population, many wear masks. I'm sure contributing spread, pales comparison give take 30% population actively shitting collective efforts everyone around put effort made sacrifices common good. 

Neither help, me, one far easier rationalize sympathize other. Oxford vaccine based years work MERS vaccine going phase 3 successfully far. minimal short term side effects long term ones. based traditional vaccine injecting dead virus antibody production safe. totally getting one Sorry family. fought good fight. downplay this, gofundme says immunocompromised. don’t know media isn’t reporting this. true also think like we've never actually needed to. sars mers contained needed one. nobody investing trillions vaccinate common cold ya know?  Also, attempt discipline them, forget write massive documentation incident them. Also, expect call parents actually kid's problem. Go ahead try pass administration, they're nowhere found. Also, make sure keep normal classroom work well.

This make big bucks though! Teaching easy, worry, 9 short months ""play time"" summer. rodeo AZ weekend. far behind... 100 years, everyone finally wised fact maybe genociding torturing animals pleasure bad thing, also withhold praise non-vegan historical like facts people know better now.

Know better what? human animal vastly different cognitive ability, white black person aren't. see point solid analogy think we'll ever reach point society finds animal-eating reprehensible, something fundamentally instinctive eating survival (while enslavement, torture, rape, shoutout Thomas Jefferson, seem far deeper moral implications).

I'm saying men era participating normalized culture- white I'd probably owned slave back (like everybody else). However, Founding Fathers establish American government, also *pioneered American culture* *backs enslaved Africans*. think much significant moral liability men propagated whole matter merely participated. Wheres guy said US plateau? think needs see lol 😂 Stop league four month, restart worst time one hardest hit states ""A 21-year-old student Penn State -- plans allow students return fall -- died respiratory failure coronavirus complications last month, university said.

Way go, got go. Rest peace. Fluidigm tests waiting approval - saliva based kits. moron doesn’t care let us rot. really making argument centralize testing USFG bad CDC fucked February? bad now, thanks.  American - could imagine? Canada please start accepting political asylum seekers? Maybe figure tests coming back positive covid person never even tested. 

OR

Maybe figure swabs coming back positive never used. 

Fix testing first. Britain gonna go full florida month honest question? sitting enclosed classroom possibly hundreds students would make huge difference. Well first point you’re idiot true. 

America profit health care system. From
First hand knowledge spouse working elective surgery, last thing major hospital wants shut elective surgeries. It’s wide spread knowledge turning hospital Covid hospital shutting elective surgeries hurts “for profit” health care systems. 

This different economist insisting need stay open, dial back things opening, benefits business aspect. 

I find ironic you’re touting reports, overwhelming knowledge shows info, also info people transported hospitals. Front line workers WORK HOUSTON doctors nurses, saying something quite contrary claim. 

The people going “unnecessary panic” “no big deal” people financially benefiting stressing finances matter. 

I’ll believe doctors corporate backed money moguls.

The people sitting home saying “everything okay” doctors nurses Houston apparently coming forth lying fabricating severity Covid gets 15 minutes news fame.. 

/s know  work gym $5 month. thousands work warehouse low income &amp; qualify for. many religious affiliated gyms offer discounted low income rates. local YMCA free people prove low income. helps, went dentist last week (in CA) hygienist four layers PPE working - surgical mask, n95, another surgical mask top, face shield. diagnosed early periodontitis early year scaling root planing put frequent cleaning schedule usual 6 month deal, really want keep delaying next cleaning.

That's point. feel way Americans friends, worried going survive shit show profit medicine, politicized masks, lack real safety wife also struggled body weight exercises, understand, sympathize. share drive, join found leaning pushups planks work well her.

Wishing speedy recovery!! clue many workout videos online!? free!? Body weight workouts!? Stop making excuses! Get ass get Googling really want exercise! guess one them. messed back last year, hoping get checked year, pandemic, happen. case. looking terms adverse affects? know works least target people historically adverse reactions (example, people 30 underlying conditions adverse actions). risk point go? someone explain side effects? say we're super rural, small - we're analogous North Dakota terms population, half population three cities. locked pretty quick kept total cases 200, I'm actually pretty proud local government population handled things.

I probably put poorly, point really even though one currently active case entire province, seems like people starting take precautions rather less. generally positive thing, hope thing happening US, rural otherwise! country can't survive lockdown long. Either mandatory testing everyone mandatory quarantines accept infections. think shamwow-ing would effective. got tested NC could go see sister safely. (Still wore mask stayed mostly outdoors) 

Took 6 days get result. told would three. almost ran milk want get groceries ANYTHING seen sister getting tested. Total bullsh recent cleaning too. limited use spraying water didn’t polish teeth (which sucks like part) fairly normal. x-rays dentist checked teeth. Feelings hurt: check  Damn dude. really got completely agree. life valuable anyone else’s. autoimmune disease, get really bad rabbit hole. want anyone else dealing anxiety know incredibly small chance could happen. doesn’t mean won’t happen take seriously. Thanks, know that. People douchy attitude don’t really back kind irk me. really ignored need coffee anyway. Deaths per capita meaningless stat unless also factor tests per capita.

They're proportional. WTF wrong politicians? half-assed measures confuse piss populace. real shutdown endure short term pain real gain. not, taking 1 step forward 2 steps back. real ignorant. even know me, jumping conclusions. live small apartment, like said. can't even afford kind internet. stream slow connection mobile data, works fine. High school may slightly tame sanitary lense, oof! God bless you, could never teach high school, sass, eye-rolling, class skipping. Etc. I’d lose mind. would teacher everyone saw kill-joy lol. 

Each grade level struggle pandemic unique kiddos work with! Honestly hated virtual teaching too. wasn’t engaging even effective hands learning little ones. aren’t good options feel. know follow current plan teachers wear masks, students that’s it. effective teacher worrying everything else. completely honest: he's adult, life. mind taking risk, let be. Unfortunately, that's backwards. Masks protect others us, us others. Unless p95 mask, sure. flag vote weekend, noticed video black legislators wearing masks whites ones tended be. body may make counterproductive antibodies make easier virus infect new cells, making infection much severe. 

I think implies anything broader immune system. blood clots leg blood thinners causing dangerous drop blood pressure. decided get rid leg body didn’t fighting too. 7 days still result NYC... yea, we’re def fucking again. Also makes think record breaking numbers new cases seriously lagging reality cause apparently records 7 days behind Damn. poor wife young child. really makes sad. seriously still whining wearing mask ""impeding muh freedoms"", go f*** yourself. Appears set GoFundMe. many friends, begin easy me. I've since made friends told social media pain, deal it. mean to. know else wanted still jobs?  millions essential workers. Good.

BTFO deaths primarily uncounted covid deaths 🙄 think there's app take pic mole analyzes you. could also schedule tele-visit dermatologist (if access this). Makes regret moving Florida many years ago. know...you look really foolish right now.  Right?!? stage NY full lockdown. Potentially. knows? nuisance. city one fatality 11 years outside dive bar. seems like constantly paying police overtime, gone like skies cleared lol Probably services strained too. [300 firefighters, EMTs, paramedics quarantining Houston 4th largest city United States they’re testing 50% positivity now. It’s already really bad it’s gonna get worse worse. Also, dumb shit still open, like theme parks. longer trust CDC, Surgeon General, FDA. task force never trusted. still hesitant say Covid spreads via aerosolized particles, help there. 

I stunned GOP governor suggesting masks may beneficial. must really really drunk say thing risk incurring ridicule wrath cults leader. could virus that? it’s sinister disease Americans diverse lot. terribly inconvenient times. you’re seeing one slice large multi-layered cake. population similar.

um...

Europe - 193 697 deaths (day 123 since 100 deaths), population 741.4 million (in 2016)

USA 132 569 deaths (day 110 since 100 deaths, population 328.2 mil (in 2019)

... 68% deaths 44% population. Amen ignoring politics regarding virus really WELL UNDERSTOOD?? excess pneumonia deaths. Fort worth seems conservative part metroplex. really surprise me. love rights much willing kill others needlessly :( 
The Adenovirus vaccine new tech all, reason ""track record"" general public considered completely unnecessary general public - adenovirus really spreads crazy close quarters like basic training facilities (which every army recruit gets vaccinated immediately upon entry basic training. 

The first adenovirus vaccine developed Walter Reed way back 1956 (discontinued manufacturing problems, say licensee bad job making it, work safe made properly). 

We vaccinated every single military recruit adenovirus 1971 1999, even stopped Wyeth labs' manufacturing facilities fallen disrepair, military pony funds new facility (and peacetime can't make for-profit company sell something feel like making more), ran it. soon stopped vaccinating, adenovirus cases basic training camps spiked right back up. military decided really need keep vaccinating all, funded Barr get running again. good track record injectable oral adenovirus vaccines. quite old tech, frankly. ""new"" part sticking SARS2 coronavirus spike protein onto adenovirus, immune system could get good look it. even ""not virus recognizeable protein structure different viral vector"" downright ANCIENT vaccine strategy (it's cowpox protects smallpox). got head start process already trying MERS.

So TLDR adenovirus ""new"", actually 50 years old. ""back"" military got cheap decided would rather sick pay vaccinate. given general population lacks ""track record"" unnecessary adenovirus can't spread easily outside basic training barracks-style housing. understanding, vaccine vector approach quite established. 

Our first vaccine ever basically ""whoah catch cowpox catch smallpox!"" He's one know. Another man got clots penis, lose it. treated successfully Even frustrating wear damn mask. isn’t like March NY lot less information dealing with. 

We’ve started opening outdoor seating NY. BF went local vineyards honestly felt nice many months. people everyone masks. felt...deserved. Like hard work, adjust. might need shut shit cause people go Disney! street vs inside mall big difference. street I'm masking keeping distance. store though, mask caution. may actually be. Viral load time infection plausible explanation young healthy nurses doctors dying higher rate comparable age groups. valid point. issue TCM runs hospitals TCM said last week ""unnecessary panic"", plenty capacity, mad electivesurgeries cancelled Houston.

Matter fact they've stopped updating website said people media misunderstanding data making allegations Houston trouble.

That true free check verify.

Contrary hysterics TCM saying 2 weeks fine stop alarmist nonsense. COVID-19 like gunshot wound?

Then again, others like compare heart disease. Less death accident could definitely factor it. want see difference place really gotten rocked Covid check NYC. increase expected deaths SHOCKING. 

Then compare another state like Texas people saying deaths hidden there’s barely jump expected deaths. pleasure working Nick couple weeks production. great person, genuine kind. virus devastating. Rest peace man. comes anti-vax BS, probably insane people masks. New rule: website starts 'news' must hire least one journalist done America/Americans have. push right leaning friends wear masks feel strongly them. mt left leaning ones already do. wear mask try follow regulations"
