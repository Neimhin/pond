0,2021-04-06," Usually start happening September. April last flu season basically over. (This applies US, I'm sure locations.) exactly it. Look quarantine testing rules interstate travel. Outside Hawaii island territories, state reasonably enforce them? many avenues out.

If something good idea unenforceable, guideline. Making law done appease people need “do something.” getting downvoted, right. National elections margins, kidding think zealous public health measures ballot. Eh, makes sense kids get vaccines.  clinical trials, separation placebo vaccine seen 14 days, however point isn’t statistically significant, experts say you’re protected week final injection. click bait Reddit think meeting vaccinated unvaccinated people person transmit virus to. walking public, know vaccinated who's not.

Let's say transmit virus vaccinated person. mutations based person's immunity, person may lightly infected, asymptomatic, get infected destroy virus fast.
If person thinks ""I'm vaccinated I'm risk others"", walks bus without mask, infect someone.

There's one problem throughout whole pandemic - measures mostly need take account everyone acts responsible, there's direct risk. wanted know good place discuss something might interesting people, although purely anecdotical.

I covid19 last august, mild case. fever 1 day, completely lost sense smell 3 weeks (taste perfectly fine). slowly recovered sense smell afterwards.

Its many months, there's still 1 lasting effect:

My sense smell slightly different before. Certain smells different before, re-learning are. best example artificial skunk smell Natural gas (Thiol/mercaptan) used smell one way, smells almost like curry.

&amp;#x200B;

Reminds people wonder see colours taste flavours. believe don't, since even smell year ago. brain retrained that. Neurological symptoms manifesting post acute COVID patients well. less common psychiatric symptoms likely affect specifically 65+ crowd. talk long term mortality concerns COVID, important. lot ongoing scholarship conditions serious dementia seem increased risk post covid No. Move Canada. It’s “at least” 6 months question is, end? leave house. Yeah, cuz they're croaking! I've seen lot dates things happen past year, expect one also change June 15th. lol would like going moot businesses still mandate them. good lifted state Target still wont let dont wear one? Many people voluntarily cooped year. vaccine passport means beat back virus make safe everyone come hole.

Passports like reinforced walls keeping camp safe outbreak zombie movie function. Wow. made appointment online Iowa, never asked ID insurance card showed up. asked feeling well day gave shot. Online form asked name, DOB, email phone number, well medical condition. pretty stunned TBH. Kind surprised norm, seeing government supposed sponsoring shots.  Zoom another long line video conferencing us WFH people using years. Skype, google hangouts, gotomeeting, slack, etc. Zoom come Zoom go. sick, yes. don’t doubt assholes region

No, no, that's [El seriously, go Duncan Hunter Darrell Issa? Canada much better place UK. US done sometime May extra doses get sent Canada.

Uk 2nd doses vulnerable till June 15.  supply coming AZ stopped younger population. Okay. actually somewhat agree you. that's really concern is. Back first question. proposed solution anti-maskers antivaxxers lying vaccination status? Great! Seemed strange nobody tracking. leaves Federal vs State medical powers issue. already expected. Butantan institute Brazil always said two doses necessary. 14 days what's lie? specific can't take seriously. Yeah I'm sure purely due covid. Lockdowns, isolation, job loss probably played part this. LEAST I’m going start going stores wearing mask, outdoor dining (only distanced) take kids things like zoo aquarium. That’s big increase activity us vs last year. desire crowded setting indoors don’t want around unmasked people point. isn’t appealing now, it’s sacrifice avoid. longer allow posts vaccine count—you post daily discussion sub now. Didn’t US, license mark use glasses. Niceeee heard immunity within communities  sex club bar, sure could. could require [HIV negative test CONDOMS. could require order keep staff patrons safe, continue coming back spending money - don’t get reputation around town PLACE GOT AIDS. lie. say someone who’s terrified virus myself: “double mutant variant” mix two mutations (which actually even high number considering variants many changes) two key mutations found different variants already existence. 

There’s presently nothing mean nothing, indicating convergent mutations result vaccines less efficacious themselves. 

Now could well change. there’s reason alarmed SA variant, “double mutant” one key mutations. gave eye exam? probably agree social credit score like China well. incentivize state sanctioned behavior using socially punitive measures. could go wrong? parts state including next county mine covid gone Roughly 10 days protection starts. day 14 you’re 80%. Study: Eating crackers cause thirst.
CNN: Eating crackers trigger potentially fatal hydrogen dioxide shortage, study finds mean, we'd kind fucked, no? better going down. data, science, says vaccinated person protected - around them. Asking person wear mask reason security theater utter bullshit. outright joke many people shouted trust science support lockdowns trying hide away. schools declare anti-vaccine good well. dumb IMO, know people since didn’t want find shot record. Well, vaccines, think people would loosening much, cases going back up. vaccines, might never gone February highs... Complicated tease effect. made laugh least. never wanna run another DBQ practice again. can't even really look previous tests something like News. point hope asteroid hits earth everyone moves Texas. county? Well, close exactly. Correct Modena trial (15,210 people received vaccine, 11 infections, mild \[185 placebo group\]), Pfizer trial 21,720 people got shot, 8 people became infected, 1 8 serious infection \[162 placebo group, 9 seriously\]. say person hospitalized, though, die. Still great, can't say 100%, like 99.99%. Harder pry people’s medical details. bar wouldn’t able deny service HIV positive people, require themselves. sound like refusing admit covid isn’t chickenpox. communicable disease. Like stds. Simple answer: Seems like actually soft timelines based vaccinations, though, actuality. look deaths per capita(excess) like 10 EU countries ahead UK.

Italy, Spain Portugal Belgium 6 Eastern EU countries. Cap honor. Agree. percentages actually lower recent stats I’ve read general population. 

I believe neuropsychiatric effects illnesses, also don’t like kind manipulation use Pfizer Sinovac  data support hospitalization younger unvaccinated age group  increase infection reported US EU countries recently.  herd immunity reached, relaxing physical distancing measure bad idea

&amp;#x200B;

1. Would like see breakdown. seems mostly Sinovac.

3. EU, yes, barely vaccinated anyone. US, no, even close.

Any country vaccinated least 30% people Chinese vaccine (UAE, Chile, Bahrain) currently seeing surge cases, plateau high level relative peak. country vaccinated least 30% people non-Chinese vaccine (US, UK, Israel, Malta), seen clear massive decline cases. US plateau, pretty low level relative peak. 

Also, despite releasing data back December, neither Chinese vaccine published data peer reviewed journal. vaccines market (including Russian one) have. Why?

4. Agreed. don’t mess youth sports. pretty obvious since patriot act kept extending Here’s journal link

http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(21)00084-5/fulltext There's 7 variants US. Check what's happening Michigan UK variant. never plastic shields begin with. agree proud students- I'm definitely proud mine. Cases Texas lowest since July still declining though. People vaccinating probably already caught it. Bad news: right there's federal database, state maintaining one. vaccinated, there's record state--your name, when/where vaxxed, brand lot no, etc. 

I sincerely doubt country accept easily-forged, unsigned, little paper card proof vaccination (or proof anything else matter).  worked COVID unit full time job (home health side gig), many patients said clue got virus leave homes. Low behold, asymptomatic caregiver family member spreads it...or one thinks cold. Medical exemptions legit always around. Based. CNN article, academic report  person says “covid jab” confirm. sister, bf, mom said won’t get vaccine.

My 66 year old dad stage 4 cancer got it. rest fam woke garbage. stupid fucking logic.  Deaths *way* reliable cases. There's reason death rates used basis calculating overall infection rate country. Policy leadership huge effect infection rates specifically vulnerable populations (New York way fewer elderly residents Florida many deaths). no, im favor trusting science. current uptick cases likely actually blunted fourth wave. Cases sharply rising around world, US seeing modest increase. we’re like 40% adults least one dose. vaccines working, need keep distributing Happen, probably. enforced followed much, doubt it. think it’s likely hospitals, nursing homes, kinds things, broad compliance across whole city region? Nah. So, favor masks forever. Good know. mean connected communist party China Wow way early 2022 latest! may need federal intervention California. Canadian think hole thing exaggerated. 2 months behind America. aren’t best country vaccinations world still well, trust science, science says masks unnecessary, scientifically logically good keep mask mandates place post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* managed spell parts name incorrectly lol that’s pretty impressive five states far. fun staying home!! I'm fully vaccinated flying sunshine warmth next weekend. ""hardly Covid cases months"" ""still restricted"", sure, maybe drops points polls 55% popularity right now...which exactly far 62% electorate voted 2018.  


Considering right 40% state wants recall him...and that's 2% 38% vote 2018, massive ""IFs"". also excited! treat like last summer -- outdoor socialization masks.

Imagine feel got close, sacrificed much, catch Covid 2 days first dose. Stay safe!! No, pure speculation part. made clear. know Australians think zero Covid long term strategy. circumstances, sensible strategy wait vaccines.

In experience, Australians angry federal government bungling vaccine rollout. litany stuff ups little transparency. Scott Morrison trying cover arse, Australians happy response state governments unhappy federal response. state (NSW) petitioned federal government take least part responsibility vaccine rollout happy ScoMo said yes. state proven competent.

And yes, producing vaccines. blaming international supply total cop out. know who's point? suck couple months herd immunity... Many people got sick trial first 3 weeks. *some* antibodies week 2, double week 3. I’d advise sensible least week 3. Twice fighting power! you, that’s I’d do.

My husband waiting second doses fully done, booked fun weekend away celebrate- makes waiting easier gives us something celebrate! Vaccines reduce chances infected entirely eliminate it. public easier blanket rule one allow people lie get around. 

That said, hanging vaccinated people risk low think need wear mask. without passports. vaccinated person risk almost anyone, vaccinated not. Actually, record COVID shot went MyChart record... again, got COVID shot healthcare provider sponsored vaccination site. ******coughs... Bullshit Depends country in. US, instance, right complete medical privacy, calling sick without specifics fine. 

I know boss wants vaccine, mind telling vaccine makes take day work. US projected Trump world... Brazil reflected back made image evidence all. Yeah that’s what’s rly  Okay. words ratio vaccines distirbuted UK?

Because like, others still effective it, degree herd immunity probably counted on, right? lot states end excluding people state IDs, tend disproportionately poor minority. know check IDs county. North Korea skipping Olympics giving Dr. Evil vibes form Austin Powers. got one rare good ones legit think you’d get fired something getting vaccine?  Except did, can’t snap fingers open vaccine factory.  Craig predicted people would start worrying like this, discriminatory vaccines readily available anyone. Meaning vaccinated grandparents may able travel, wont, demented government supplied enough vaccines everyone.

The EU guarantees right citizens residents travel freely within EU. emergency bans travel lifted (some coming weeks), discriminatory requirements would unconstitutional legal nightmare. 
The EU private business, moron. Right? Although, raised catholic even lot shame begin with, sure learned fast. fuel efficiency stated miles per gallon fuel sold litre found article says whatever difference makes appears tiny, lack data gurantee reduces hospitalization. me. clear AZ extremely effective variant currently circulating UK offering extreme worst case scenario asking UK could possibly another wave. keep using works well variants circulating UK continue used situation changes.  still wear mask vaccinated? been, Google says CDC says still gotta wear it. mean, like mask ( Sub-Zero 'Mortal Kombat'), asking why. month ago said good Alabama open flat date. put option neighboring states opening up. best worlds degree people would access vaccine then. Low behold 16 older open up. it’s somewhat put choice safety. Obviously there’s circumstances part it’s way. don’t think that’s really case. understand I'm still seeing people subreddit saying could never happen they're far conspiracy theory. [New York literally announced going ahead last two lines commonly see subreddit ""That's insane impossible conspiracy people, delusional thinking would happen"" ""It's good system I'm happy they're going ahead it, delusional thinking problem."" Food thought. behavior absolutely originally motivated convenience, environmental aspect bonus. happens environmentally conscious way aligns effecient profitable way businesses like Amazon, B2B providers business. services actively promote ""delivery scheduled day, use less boxes"" model giving rebates, coupons digital dollars toward digital products. grocery store app simply set way delivery always set day pay additional delivery charge. costs significantly less fuel wear tear vehicles, aka operational costs. 

To address concerns. Honestly, additional trip happens infrequently. think really happens I'm going try new recipe night. things simply wait next Monday. also drive truck work used fill every day two, twice week that's driving customer sites. packaging store vs boxed (even supermarket would still bag produce like get delivered). Boxes 100% recyclable, try reuse many possible used plastic bags stores kind wash. 

Everyone different situation though. lived Brooklyn business, could walk bike buy everything anything, pretty much 24/7. Obviously delivery everything living situation effecient good environment. \*breathing intensifies Ohio\*

Edit: Ohioan. comment autobiographical. Mr. Bullshitnaro blame this. make suffer like information Covid strains dominant ones Asia right now? sure here, not. wrong. NHS plan leaked press instructions say watch peak August. know one those. personal assistant got shot Bronx beginning February, penthouse UWS. course personal assistant didn’t get one couple weeks ago. That's it. We're descending totalitarianism. I'm vaccinated show papers participate human society complete insanity. want gay crocodile Presenting medical records go Japan Germany different presenting medical records see movie go amusement park. people good identifying short-term sacrifice actually long-term best interest. read love neighbour get shot first confused 😂 arguing anyways? never said additive. completed second dose yesterday. day today felt like complete crap. typical symptoms mentioned vaccine giver. want call sick work tomorrow legitimately feel terrible. barely get bed. planning emailing supervisor. political vaccine been, mention vaccine call sick email? indicate I’m feeling well? Safe teachers. Kids still spread it, especially they’re 3 feet apart CDC says safe. 

Osterholm says UK variant effects kids lot spreads rapidly among them. Whether true won’t know bit.  Yeah, every time look data I'm flabbergasted. Seriously, what's happening Michigan? Case numbers meaningless people dying/getting serious illness due vaccinations. math earlier comment, yeah. June 15 everyone wants vaccination least first shot. says #AT LEAST. 

At least 6 months. LEAST. Say now... AT...LEAST. debatable. really depends measure success is.

If ignore vaccine situation minute unrelated lockdowns:

1. Lockdowns disastrous economy. regard better off.
2. Europe (for now) far fewer deaths we've had, regard better off.

I guess depends priority is. valid argument made approaches.

As someone managed vaccinated without ever getting Covid, US option worked well me. died covid, image I'd feel differently. hybrid model employees we'll office part time working remotely rest time.

Personally I'm opinion many things culture actually permanently change this. REALLY hope one them. seems like huge majority people agree hybrid model like would significant improvement full-time office. would amazing somehow became norm now.   got vaccine oppose vaccine passports. show papers participate society authoritarian step far. life next years.

You're welcome stay locked basement years rest us getting back lives. make appointment (with consent course)? state, toy need trivial info make appointment state, may are? like highest per capita states “science following” governors 

Florida Floridaing expected, wondering Texas list seems like danger kid's health covid me. Breast milk bodily fluid carry kinds infectious disease chemical dangers, many pose far danger children covid does. like milk banks giving breast milk parents want put school lunches. collecting random women internet street expose kid anything may carrying Hey remember Bol-shit-naro said vaccine turn crocodile
 
I memba  know mean, you? akready wish flu. Billions flu Baines made produced every year. Hey parents age range! going get vaccinated told see did. fully vaccinated, ""hard-ass"" friends also getting vaccinated apparently ""wasn't bad."" Sure resent little it, good. everything deaths increasing.

Just great. 95% much high enough. Covid 0 simply ever going happen. Lol, attacking you, literally asking link like, one good example Covid treatment suggesting. hard ask, especially google first five articles fence. 
 
If feel attacked asked single article support, that's less attacking you, unwilling support claim light barest scrutiny. 
 
I'm suspicious also, literally subreddit dedicated product, stocks attached product, includes conversation posting product corona subs bump stock increasing traffic/interest. 
 
All totally fine, solid treatment, asked like, one study think representative strong could also point to. 
 
Literally attacking, I'd love read another treatment option, that's good news. Outta possible people Biden Balmain wears off, may icky need one booster shot, halving need doses. Cuomo's gotta save news another scandal discriminatory? deny service someone who's wearing mask discriminatory? Also every country discriminatory/privacy laws US. read OP article, main issue discrimination privacy. view Americans 65 ceiling general population. instance think we'll ever situation 80% vaccinated 18-65 85%. risk anywhere near relevant younger Americans, even factor comorbidities like overweight smoking.

It would obviously nice everyone get vaccinated due greater good impact herd immunity, individual lower risk inherently lower likelihood feel compelled get vaccine. said, Facui predicted seventy percent country getting vaccinated could grant us herd immunity- long knew incredibly effective mRNA vaccines would could appreciate impact infection induced antibodies. think we're pretty good position. 

I think even case rise, we're going see death decline continue due high risk populations overwhelmingly vaccinated. think we'll also see cases begin decline weeks, especially information coming case decline largely fueled Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Florida- feel could solely due spring break travelers, demographic vaccinated also less risk severe illness. mods banned said put daily discussion megathreads Mmmmm White Castle. 

I wish they’d hurry expand Texas. could go 10 sack fries Time. It’ll take time. got second two weeks I’ll still scared. I’m high risk life turned upside whole ordeal. It’s going take time get used even going outside again. got vaccine vaccine passports ticket dystopia outside sole exception maybe international travel. lmao **it won’t require state emergency** implemented. **How EU vaccine passport aim EU pass get travel moving across borders, ""without discrimination"", getting organised short space time significant challenge. **EU leaders called legal technical work go ahead ""as matter urgency""** maintaining restrictions non-essential travel moment. **The original plan certificate place summer deadline could hard meet.**

Read article. already implemented NY. think anyone actually using yet, everyone know who's vaxxed downloaded assumption they'll need something line.

Agree rendered obsolete things normal (or normal-ish) again, think idea use we're getting there. Seems happening changing anything. feel safer fully vaccinated still wear kn95 etc. worried let keep spreading among kids variants become increasingly dangerous kids. seems might want something not, schools safe all. Awful news. fucking shame Bolsonaro vile directly responsible outbreak Brazil. evil attitude towards gone unpunished too. wonder that's enough deal new infectious strains. Indian sero studies shown 50% sero-positive rates multiple large urban areas yet currently getting hit pretty big wave. Might need something like 80% achieve meaningful herd immunity. Come summer things start getting bumped, slate empty next month two, many bigger releases while, huge megaplexes might hold even longer. Ireland. done age across board people working home 30s done teachers, guards, retail staff etc 20s Yeah, side effect sunlight found took hours alcohol evaporate cold dark versus sunlight—but careful things melting (butter, cheese) since live desert.

We didn’t leave house either except unavoidable medical events drop ballot outdoor box. Actually good news. Nice see clinical tries confirmed real life. Butantan Brazil always said got protection 2 weeks second dose. United States Rona! didn’t even get covid 6-8 drinks day year shelter place finally cracked definitely sending liver enzymes charts well, program reimburse expenses retroactively occurred corona since jan 2020, majority reimbursements whatever prices paid back  years ago move realized maybe 20 bags frozen breast milk freezer 6 months old. searched local facebook sort exchange within like 6 hours mom showed coolers pick milk. people take stuff seriously. even messaged us months later saying son drank it! happy donate always bit weirded giving kid breast milk mom. important know info vaccines given way reduces deaths much possible.   Early typos aside, remained readable. unable overlook typos, suggest don’t enter legal profession you’d quickly pay it. far 4am typos go...My 4am brain function hardly biggest challenge you’ll face....but really can’t get it, good luck. Sincerely Thought: Canadians pay taxes bill strain Covid puts healthcare system, whereas states individual pay. Collectively, vaccinating higher risk could considered financial benefit Canada. said that, te idea equating lives money makes sick. please stop rooting masks places like grocery stores target, vulnerable people sometimes really go get stuff? There's significant number people would love get vaccine can't legitimate medical reasons need care bit protecting covid deniers antivaxxers dislike masks. Want get rid masks bars restaurants, anywhere eating/drinking expected, makes sense. People avoid places much easier shopping groceries detergent. places optional need continue masks reach enough vaccinations get herd immunity (which I'm sure happen without coercing significant numbers people getting jabbed). Yep, even put medical paperwork anymore. someone ask yet. Toronto? DM you’d like know local lockdown-critical group. Plz dm me, would love see wouldn’t doubt existing context—it something cited biography.   Citing report findings divisive? 

Heres headline you:

""Men likely killed automotive crashes women"" 

Do find divisive? No, you. think going ""chain reaction"" sort reference. Like tsunami knocked backup generators causing nuclear meltdown, tsunami covid patients knocking Brazilian healthcare system resulting deaths?

I dunno, bad comparison guess that's going for. want to.. guest. don’t get mad don’t.  Masks protect others person wearing them. said pure selfishness. Thats really true. talking 2 half months now. 70-80% population protection then. Furthermore, vulnerable individuals within society vaccine refused it. point reason continue state wide mask orders. circling back then, law, reagan signed 1987, made feds pay funerals victims disasters crises, arent ok contract government governed? believe Yankees requiring  remember reading stuff, hmm...must like 8 months ago, first learned long COVID. sounds familiar.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Thanks! Looking forward semi-normalcy. I'm planning celebrating going restaurant, lol.

I get burnout groceries. first month maybe washed everything putting away. Took hour every trip. much, eventually ended creating quarantine area shelf stable items corner, shelf fridge. wash go 4-day mark, point virus denatured/dead, bother washing anything that. Technically lasts different times different surfaces (plastic, food, glass, metal), much keep track went highest number. No, it’s go college everyone know tested positive covid. heard ONE person long term affects saw bar week. significant issue young people would hear countless stories someone friend “long covid”. sample outlier (take stats course please) friends schools would talk long covid impacts friends, don’t isn’t issue. Funerals definitely get expensive. swear Texas living completely different reality rest world. I'm ""for it."" I'm OK that's contract federal government struck military personnel. come service, here's list things we'll provide: pay such-and-such level, access TSP, medical benefits, etc etc, funeral die.

I'm also OK saying funeral part deal giving service people pay instead. seems like military funeral valued that's cool that's want.  government Canada saying require proof vaccination enter country. wonder going play considering share longest land border world US. headline divisive. wouldn’t even problem baseball. spring summer sports safer ones cited article Canada 16 weeks doses.

It really apples-to-apples comparison.  said nothing shutting schools, masks kids get vaccines. Kids access vaccines flu. need TLDR; disturbing information terrible headline you’re telling me.... try hard careful read. downside?

Oh, know... General discomfort, able read facial cues, constantly needing ask people repeat themselves, able lip read, contact dermatitis... nothing divisive report. Try clicking next time.  federal government reach power overall American government, type crisis handled it. 

Instead, Bolsonaro anything, *actively sabotaged* governors tried things, political discourse also action - tried cancel lockdowns nationwide.

And result? 4k deaths today alone, third worldwide Covid deaths today. incompetent think petty whining internet fix it? idiots literally stated opinion, fact right way would generate unique QR code person. Give card, app, many want. venue scans QR code, encodes URL webpage (this QR codes used), contain vaccination status whatever personal info reasonably shared like (maybe picture, best minimize freely available personal info).

This never happen, though, would convenient would require coordination. is. I'm asking cardiology consult next. I'm terrified work push heartrate. 

I see improvement time goes hoping get back something closer felt pre-covid.

And record, consider lucky. actual covid sickness mild. joint body pain, major fatigue pretty much it. 

My brother much better shape physically 2 years younger placed ICU week. brother law admitted ICU almost week.

No doubt though, something longer term. got first Pfizer shot last week based anecdotal reports long haulers felt better after. 

So far real improvement I'm hopeful.  anyone know it’s permanent Burn masks, bras panties ! There's reason China trying steal vaccine research America brother, time try fall it, know? One day time, one step time. 

Maybe check /r/intermittentfasting . changed life. Lost 100 pounds. Take warm shower, put layers. Though time I’m reading probably feel better.  Imagine still trying claim masks work. 

Like get tired losing? don’t get herd immunity get us? virus come back eventually. change like flu. vaccines wear off. won’t happen large portions population still risk again. feel like way really combat much population get vaccines every often like Bluna Facefit KF94s.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  They’re saying six months that’s data have. Like, it’s six month old vaccine. There’s real reason think protection short lived. got back 4 days Vegas almost everyone managed keep masks almost time. standard thing wipe equipment. protects equipment smelly overall environment stinking also keeps everything everyone sanitary. Gyms big transmitter respiratory infections skin infections. Staff infections really nasty thing kill people. skin diseases require surgery antibiotics get rid of. reasonable conclude purely environmental factors behind changes. people respiratory infections represent control study living 2020 environmental stressors. Unfortunately also possible vaccine lasts 7-12 months (they currently saying good 6 months) possible planning need start another wave vaccinations later year. think depends get it. get state federal clinic, aren’t charging anyone administrative fee. Walgreens Kroger want get paid, however. Yikes man. hope make way back someday. videos circulating fake vaccine shots help. nearly 3 million deaths bother you? Ah thank pointing out! summer George! Except available vaccine passports technology based. Look EU's proposal.  Chernobyl nearly many deaths implied hype (I think hype purposely inflated stop budding nuclear power industry tracks fossil fuel companies, digress.) comparable modern disasters deaths attributed fossil fuels AIDS took place decades. I'm referring EU taking steps require vaccine passports. majority Europe (27 46 nations), includes far popular tourist nations.  Living SB County, 16+ eligible day ago, huge rush people trying get shot zero appointments available anywhere tonight.

My 16-40 family LA area got shots days ago waiting outside extra doses last week.

Plenty people know wanted one, getting them. less rule benders/breakers might think. mean, really? You’re still unclear stuff 2021Q2? Yes no, german government basically financed research Moderna, however allowed partner Pfizer production.

So sure money bigger, one german government one US government wen towards Pfizer. fact without german government money would Pfizer vaccine all! don’t medical records treat you. better hope don’t severe allergy meds need aware of. speak common sense seems people smart enought understand factors. Except fact 99% people dont risk death covid. 2 weeks flatten curve kicked road kept elderly isolation year couldve protected well solely isolating winter. Either way similar amount people died. feel bad elderly spent last year without visitor still died covid. amount mask wearing could prevent inevitable. dont get sick walking past someone, people got sick roommates/family coworkers. unmasked guy walked past second day. shocked!  lmao hometown heard offered 5 jin eggs XD lot us understood understanding orders magnitude less impactful selfishness willful ignorance group. can't give authorization (if coma example)? reversed mandate taking control government's hands let people decide want do.

So *government* took decision *let* people ""decide"" see irony that? Yeah long term effects scared really careful past year. deal long term effects country prohibitively expensive healthcare social safety net scarier actual illness. I've seen people middle ground. example, I've seen many young (people 30) wearing masks live. But, often see completely ignoring socially distance guidelines, especially stores. assumption worried getting sick people older health issues. also know people 40 major spreaders virus think reason, think could get sick. almost like populists suck talking covid-19 vaccine specifically. asking whatever info healthcare systems keep patients. Yea ‘of covid’ isn’t excess death. history comments though, Darkdurumi: *Holy crap!*

I know serious plain satirical. Cause words, see desperately want USA take suffering despite fast vaccine rollout.

Bet number cases Winter got mind stirring makes hate living US. Dont come facts! Especially facts study! Thats really disrespectful illiterate people cannot read. Also disrespectful people read titles actual research.

Misleading title. mentioned paragraph article talks common practice India hurts heart. hope somebody helped get appointment.  went back look report, misinterpreted 10% thing. says use Pfizer Moderna 10% less hospitalizations also use J&amp;J. also using J&amp;J actually increase number hospitalizations.

Slightly confusing wording part see, basically lockdown november, slightly lifting restrictions aug/sept. 75% normal social contact november. 50% october. Current level restrictions aug/sept 25% normal social contact. Full opening april/May next year.

I think report available english. look it. prime minister suppossed talk reopening later evening, perhaps know then.

Nevertheless, reacting say vaccines dont reduce chances getting severe desease symptomatic. high school debate coaches classroom! plenty 40s Az. wife got yesterday. happen source that? saying right, genuinely curious calculated. Good question, thats wondering myself, given promised deliver vaccines Mexico asap. European, believe me, US production sent Mexico Canada would help us lot here. basically took role US supposed take send vaccines countries (among others)

I guess legal issue easy untangle, see.

Glad finally hitting US press, far hammering EU slow vaccine rollout (which huge parts caused underdelivery AZ) Maybe shed light excess deaths. see compared UK instance, seem done worse.

Link newer detailed Florida lot people. numbers still good bit peak, although slowly increasing again. someone lives Arizona, slightly disingenuous. inaccurate, cases continue fall early March. dropping - past couple weeks, there's minor sustained increase cases. think anything worry due low baseline we're fast rate vaccination, daily cases definitely declining state currently - undebatably (mild) upward trend.

False grateful zero Covid cases traced gym :) sake whatever trying say I'm going assume facts presented true. think that's data shown, that's different issue. numbers add couple counts. Pfizer \~90-95% effective protecting symptomatic infection, trials designed show, commensurate 90-95% reduction hospitalizations norway vaccinated. 10% ludicrous, unless assuming mass reinfections.

Over 100 million Americans vaccinated, anti-vax people exist fringe. fact, US population among highest world percentage Belgium: youth 15% 25% Brussels youth anti bodies, adults 16,5% vaccinated general population 6,5% antibodies.

Drives nuts get vaccine shot since ? Apparently somehow helps cases long covid. American english language see politicians need anchors spreading misinformation in.

Otherwise, country generally rules spread misinformation public platforms, stick blogs YouTube. would lot better agree. point UK may supply issues April that's zero vaccines, still enough around 2m per week according recent paper.

We've taken first delivery Moderna begin rollout ASAP expect Novavax available May apparently 10m doses awaiting fill finish.

My calculations based real figures presented (although rates likely increase) assumption UK stops vaccinating entirely going happen. gap close sure entire first jab schedule finish later July 21.5m adults left jab less vulnerable population. Yes, US Congress parliament US.  someone works tech, we're trying. super hard monitor enough enough hands deck moderation begin with. though alot friends spread across UK talk regular small portion people, think globally one biggest approval ratings vaccines masks. England solely UK yano.. folk around UK whinge wearing mask wanna get back form normality, always small minority revolt many scenario's. Nowhere Canada. even “progressive” governments. Bc big shit show Ontario. basically took role US supposed take send vaccines countries (among others)

It's US' job send vaccines countries expense people. 

And EU getting doses ordered Pfizer Moderna time. EU issues AstraZeneca, Swedish-British company fuck US. said wear mans show proof vaccination difficulty verifying everyone vaccinated applied anyways.  Depends supply demand... produce vaccinate definitely surplus vaccines stacking, waiting get new vaccines less demand met supply. Thats whats happening EU, falls behind schedule supply issues mainly Astra Zeneca. Findings

Among 236 379 patients diagnosed COVID-19, estimated incidence neurological psychiatric diagnosis following 6 months 33·62% (95% CI 33·17–34·07), 12·84% (12·36–13·33) receiving first diagnosis. patients admitted ITU, estimated incidence diagnosis 46·42% (44·78–48·09) first diagnosis 25·79% (23·50–28·25). Regarding individual diagnoses study outcomes, whole COVID-19 cohort estimated incidences 0·56% (0·50–0·63) intracranial haemorrhage, 2·10% (1·97–2·23) ischaemic stroke, 0·11% (0·08–0·14) parkinsonism, 0·67% (0·59–0·75) dementia, 17·39% (17·04–17·74) anxiety disorder, 1·40% (1·30–1·51) psychotic disorder, among others. group ITU admission, estimated incidences 2·66% (2·24–3·16) intracranial haemorrhage, 6·92% (6·17–7·76) ischaemic stroke, 0·26% (0·15–0·45) parkinsonism, 1·74% (1·31–2·30) dementia, 19·15% (17·90–20·48) anxiety disorder, 2·77% (2·31–3·33) psychotic disorder. diagnostic categories common patients COVID-19 influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 1·44, 95% CI 1·40–1·47, diagnosis; 1·78, 1·68–1·89, first diagnosis) respiratory tract infections (1·16, 1·14–1·17, diagnosis; 1·32, 1·27–1·36, first diagnosis). incidences, HRs higher patients severe COVID-19 (eg, admitted ITU compared not: 1·58, 1·50–1·67, diagnosis; 2·87, 2·45–3·35, first diagnosis).

The variants appear infectious may resistant vaccines. Didn’t figure Donald old. hate say consequences scare me, whilst America might spreading misinformation, corruption, problems socially, deteriorating blah blah etc etc, also think America simply one step ahead.

The rest us probably follow. may tin foiling up, feel accidental natural. believe third category. Remember, America, there’s always going group people won’t get solely they’re told to. know lot people would fall category. it’s “fuck govt” others “fuck society Hollywood others telling to”. Let's hope so! US fully vaccinated less 20% population, huge vaccine surplus trump's fault can't give vaccine world? keep science, logic/common sense religion separate. Yup. suuuuck. mean, can't assume 1.8 million would gotten infected really want compare normal infection rate is. link comment made days ago. never going go back was. Like 9/11. world changed different UK doing? enough vaccines everyone scenario elderly risk prioritised. Thanks proving point lack mental maturity childish outbursts. happy trash like ain’t aloud areas hang 🥰  Except no, exist yet. US placed orders them. made.

You're ignoring valid policy vaccinations want say ""america bad"". Meanwhile USA everyone eligible end month. I’m generally surprised well we’ve handled vaccine rollout piss poor response containing virus, still lasts day states reopening soon. jynx it. Never mention J&amp;J ""you know who"" sentence! Look happened Emergent!! Um, yes, especially Tennessee.... Lol Doesn’t help every news article headline designed piss off, else doesn’t get enough clicks stay business. Seems like major design failure internet age. UK accounted 3% identified cases. Less France surprisingly ... miss information plain ignorance. Unfortunately, Fauci leader misinformation changes mind every day much louded ""scandinavian neighbours"" actually had, Sweden aside, lightest touch policies Europe.

Eh, yes, didn’t wait late implemented strict measures - whole lockdown menu except curfews. absolutely nothing “light touch” actions March 2020. reason they’ve since able maintain open societies time compared others.

Why cherry picking point Sweden could done exactly same? typical indian trash involve cow dung sort? much louded ""scandinavian neighbours"" actually had, Sweden aside, lightest touch policies Europe.

Eh, yes, didn’t wait late implemented strict measures - whole lockdown menu except curfews. absolutely nothing “light touch” actions March 2020. reason they’ve since able maintain open societies time compared others. 

Why cherry picking point Sweden could done exactly same? consistently pro-HK protests consistently write news portrays China negative light? Vaccine open everyone 18+ state now. don’t see 2 months vaccine available anyone wants it, would need masks then? Well expect chinese numbers verifiable. Otherwise numbers curing 5 million corona patients Buffalo dung beat chinese numbers. Ranch superior I'll allow think what's happening also happened Q1. delayed deliveries planned. However, quarterly commitments, weekly monthly. Thus able shift around deliveries see fit, provided still meet 35 million doses Q2 target.

So delay, rescheduling 35 million delivered, amounts amount end, slightly backloaded Using arguments, EU also making extremely low number AstraZeneca doses. Frankly, Australia producing much AZ per capita EU UK, EU supply chain must used Australia hard understand. Especially EU signed contract states clearly obligation reduce EU supply. Yeah, situation unprepared countries virus first broke out. saw modern medicine run scale death rate original c19 strain around 10%. correct treatment much much lower.

But p.1 still probably qualities worth paying attention to. Pfizer huge company.

They get stuff done.

But yeah amazing good Also, control group never tested positive? dramatic developments last year, fear virus, lifestyle changes, isolation, economic impact, could well lead 1 9 people general population developing anxiety mood disorders. dont blame Merkel, fault government grossly incompetent dealing pandemic.

this whole thing really shows German Efficiency myth (something anyone spend months Germany knows) None kids yet family members chance yet either. 80% teachers, 80% students' family members. Wait family members chance vaccinated too. opened adults Monday here. Yep, I’m idiot

yes anyone else enjoying Ding seems rapidly talking abyss. threads seem increasingly outlandish, I’m seeing shared much legitimate, see lot prominent experts Twitter kind openly mocking him.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Except no

Except yes. US hording vaccine doses never use people. giving away bad policy. good.
The fact doses outside COVAX exported stupid enough itself, AZ even worse considering 80% shortfall. understand took 3 months EU start acting like every single vaccine producer world. I'd fine June, school year ends Memorial Day relevant question masks schools here. Vaccine rollouts already here. Idk you’re following news website, 75% senior citizens 80% teachers childcare workers received least one dose vaccine. know around 20% population says refuse vaccine, we’ve already hit ceiling groups.

In words, vulnerable vaccinated, COVID necessarily higher-risk disease flu rest society. maybe don’t need nightclubs open yet, youth sports absolutely should. would easy Sweden avoid thousands deaths

Yes, could stopped giving care elderly needed home care lived retirement homes, majority deaths happened. Would helped? Even areas uninhabitable, death count still orders magnitude lower c19. incredibly silly suggest otherwise. context could give would put chernobly/fukushima level c19. environmental disasters, sure death counts still really low comparison pandemic disaster still face. Chernobyl's death toll 50 additional 5000 expected due cancer. Fukushima 15000. C19 2.87 MILLION right many follow probably turn endemic disease kills couple hundred thousand per year. literally comparison Fukushima/Chernobyl c19. None. part? post, 188 points/88% upvoted, comment, 68 points? It’s really though, argument around schools polarized. one group denies covid spread schools, ridiculous. place people spreads covid, denying people spread covid schools silly. 

But another side thinks schools closed there’s risk, equally insane. grocery stores, government agencies, places open covid spreads. places essential schools (I work one). it’s risk-benefit, 80% teachers vaccinated adults access vaccine, don’t see argument keep depriving kids education (remote learning substitute) keep going strong want in-person education. Yes Moderna going deliver vaccine somewhat later even 2022 EU wants access latest option. look delivery scheduale Belgium Pfizer going dubble supply end may (562 770/week) although going dip whith 20k less per week end may. Oven cooked bad deep fried food, potatoes still hyperglycemic food, dipping concoction tomato paste/corn syrup still makes even worse. (corn syrup sugar derived corn). 

anyhooo...thanks asking, Peace. right? shame people house payed mortgage full, thus STILL pay it/rent. indian publication expect sounds shitty, must frustrating doctor idea do. Hope get better soon. stole science! don’t think that’s all. People want kids participate normal activities year lives disrupted. Ugh, sorry, scary. old he? Hope it’s temporary goes away quickly. going happen confusing indeed... Lmao watched utopia Except *no*. America hardest hit nation. exactly Americans vaccinate theirselves first? country cases, dangerous variant emerge, would likely here. Yeah, ways, younger patients lose. Safer flu ? Source daily reminder Merkel go fuck say, did, posts reinforced stereotype reinforced stereotype someone did. play part hardening fronts preventing open dialog. view religion bad thing, probably goal get people it. reading post mentioned condescending tone easy religious person think ""wow, asshole"" instead automatically take contrarian position ideas. working goals sence.

Towards paragraphs 2/3: tone post post reads different me, may subjective. think point neccesarily invalid here. define religion certain fundamental beliefs, someone claiming part religion. someone said ""I'm totally Christian, believe Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hades, Athene, etc..."", rightfully think ""no, that's christianity, thats ancient greek paganism"". Mormons actually share bunch Christian beliefs? clue, never spent time read mormonism, basically non-existent, country.

Climate change denial easily swept away data. Vaccines making children autistic easily swept away data. People hold onto that, despite provably wrong, either uneducated idiots. core difference: Religious people provably wrong. perspective might likely wrong, can't proof things say (Except people, believe earth 6000 years old, that's obviously falsifiable).

And ties last paragraph: Psychologically hard step change opinion, without proven wrong, especially opinion given early childhood. Take random thing, someone told child: Let's say, ""vegetables healthy"". someone comes claims opposite, natural reaction would ""I believe you, evidence?"". come problem again: proof God Allah Zeus whoever fake easy religious person remain unconvinced. Always keep mind, religious people start believing twenties thirties whatever. state always assumed, brought way. understand people start religious stop, natural respect them, even I' personally assuming starting part totally arbitrary dependent born.

But again, point. demand respect beliefs. laugh want, alone friends, whatever. ask bit human deceny change tone less condescending one. currently internet equivalent someone running around town square yelling random fat people lose weight. hypothetical person neccesarily wrong factual level regarding health. just, makes life bit unconfortable everyone involved situation, without likely achieving results. brings back question already asked last post: ""What gain shitting peoples beliefs way do?"" 

(Everyone focuses christianity, OP evangelical leaders). don’t even worry Alabama resident, dont think restrictions mean much anything anymore anyways. go anywhere outside Birmingham Huntsville nobody wearing mask anymore. pretty sure restaurants gone back 100 percent. thing remaining big chains start getting lax mask enforcement. Sorry you’re downvoted, upvote. place turning crazy town ill believe see it, far nothing german government done made faith them. go jail incompetence think unless vaccine ‘passports’ take off, vaccination won’t matter mask wearing requirements. Far many ppl would lie, disregard health/safety practices &amp; trigger outbreaks probably also refused vaccination begin with. feel like ""mood, anxiety sleep problems"" apply everyone days far know, J&amp;J slightly increased expected deliveries April May, least according Germany Denmark’s plans, looking least promising. Yeah, something three, time. Yep, I’m idiot think US government take care citizens first. 

Seek help man, clearly need work anger management. started headache 4 hrs shot (went away quickly), followed exhaustion fuzzy thinking entire next day. swollen lymph nodes week after. UK making doses massive shortfall AZ supply. never intended supply EU initially. exported tiny amount we're making we'd import even more, seems waste everyone's time effort let alone environmental impact. 

We invested millions factories EU. get supplies maybe investment refunded? Ya better mutations develop locally. J&amp;J needs deliver 55M doses 3 months. That's something even AZ managing do. Please J&amp;J least comparable AZ. Oh, idiot despite knowing better? That's even worse. think important keep things perspective. many people worldwide gotten COVID? Officially around 2%. Let's even assume that's undercounted; say actual numbers 2 3 times greater. around 1 20 people disease. fraction enduring long-term symptoms, may permanent, may be. know rationally call ""permanent reduction QOL entire world.""

Thank you, read article even author admits speculation terminology used,.  see anyone disputing variants indeed mutuants fact [hospitalization rates people 70 going people full immunized. rate vaccination 40-60 years old still quite low priority groups. Middle age adults ones filling hospitals, trend seen before, happening also countries.

True told. government overconfident reopening expected elderly covered sufficient. lesson learn. Helping others helping point understand. thought bit funny too. Lol think partially right. 

I think correct approach remain flexible plan. Originally vaccinating dying right approach. since situation changed. VOC emerged affecting public now. Relying metric age going downward longer moral thing do. wise curtail pandemic. would wise jab cases are. 

The plan flexible rather rigid. continue follow science (which told since beginning.) two things done - would abandon age based approach switch regularly interacting society. little alternative isolate. approach one would biggest bang vaccination buck damage spread virus. 

All written really hurts too, getting close personal eligibility. actuality advocatint best interest. :) still think shifting gears new approach would best. Let's imagine unvaccinated, highly infectious person spends time vaccinated person. time, infectious person transmits significant viral load vaccinated person.

The vaccinated person's immune system immediately mount immune response begin attacking viruses without mercy. rapid immune response, virus chance really multiply vaccinated persons body. can't multiply, viral load cannot grow. vaccinated person therefore high enough viral count body transmit another person. low viral count also prevent vaccinated person becoming ill. 

The vaccine *stop* virus physically infecting person, vaccine cause person's viral load low become ill capable infectious  That's idiotic, that's extremely intelligent. Old people hundreds times likely die covid young people. never promised many doses beginning year, good everyone knew expect it. deliveries supposed happen Q3? vote. I’m saying overall CFR low consider people recovered “survivors”. Close 100 people workplace it, none fatal one hospitalized rest mild asymptomatic cases. I’m going call people survivors \*blows mind\*

Who would thought?  soon FDA approved someone's going challenge they'll probably win, even conservative SCOTUS. Case law supports schools requiring vaccinations. surprise /s Maybe it’s school sports? Kids plague rats. Bolsonaro piece shit lot reasons, case, speeding vaccine rollout may may possible, propose does? Lockdowns shown marginally effective best completely ineffective worst, depending countries states comparing. prefer WHF office hybrid... introverts like myself, almost ideal scenario. course past year (stimmy assisted course), I've upgraded media room display really nice home entertainment setup makes better going movie theater (if ever open). Also taken half-finished basement room that's around 800sq ft made gym complete weights, battle rope station, yoga rebound area, Peloton Plus bike. 

Driving truck normally, I'm saving $50 week fill (was $30 time last year suck Joe). There's free time, less pressure. works. swear bosses old job really disliked families... ALWAYS office. probably bosses, ""facetime"" seriously... would want away family much... Heard Podcasts.

Don’t *that* guy.

Have nice day. Stay fuck away Stay home mom 3 kids remote school. Peloton sanity saver year. Quick little rant, places (like NCL cruise ships, sports stadiums, colleges opening person classes) requiring everyone provide proof vaccination STILL making people go stuff like testing, mask wearing, social distancing, etc? Stuff like makes wonder even got vaccinated. thing could maybe think they're waiting actual herd immunity scrap stuff, hope can't sure. Anyone else got ideas? I'm sure going cruise whatever I'm fully vaccinated (I am) wear mask comply covid protocols course factors, simple deductive reasoning say lockdowns crucial one. stupid people also extremely disinterested reading anything longer two lines. 

Hence success Reddit. inability immediately answer specific ""highly credentialed doctor"" backing claims speaks volumes veracity. really good job contact tracing Ireland? article suggests managed track exposure 80% cases, that’s unbelievably phenomenal. don’t shit forever. said, vaccinations rise. lockdown keep cases interim hospitals stable population reaches herd immunity w vaccinations, open up. mentions article Serious question- articles posts include unscientific twitter speculation variants allowed, articles hard data cases, deaths, vaccinations not? logic here? bad decision. 

The useful feature sub ability find data easily. hard data allowed, conversation going devolve unscientific freakouts variants, complaining hypothetical behaviors anti-vaxers, posts saying OP got vaccinated. None useful. No, nothing Trump. fact data says.  


The rate severe illness death kids 14 1 1 million. teens 1 100k. everything political nowadays? someone follow actually scientific doesn’t fold every Twitter trend? may right, schools almost guarantee, surprised less businesses think adopt it. people start going they'll going hard...and limiting potential pool people willing present passport going hard sell business next door it.

Also, laws tested. far tell Texas law forbids local government use, private companies use it...the Florida law outright bans them. They're floundering. daily updates stopped Sunday. UK virus control now. death toll Brazil rising really quickly. deaths per capita aren’t far apart. Maybe not, vitro studies one. one vivo.

P1 seems virulent march already dominant strain Brazil think realistic timeline getting back closer normal, large events happening masks possibly proof vaccination? regular normal? feels much closer would guessed. Lots people don’t rely coworkers social interaction Hey. COVID 4 months ago. got vaccine yesterday worse covid (for me). I'm sooooo sick. second dose better? immunocompromised due Crohns medication. Calling ""double mutant"" funny too, since variants way two mutations. two? Gotta pump numbers up, rookie numbers.

[B.1.1.7., UK variant, example eight could retroactively pay everyone else gets vaccinated form tax credit. claimed PM response rule enacted ""weeks ago."" Truth? Still stupid rule, whether yesterday month ago. yet government restricts drugs prostitution.  US definitely approving now, point don’t need it. surveyed 800 people area. 800 people 0 chance representing majority public. Dr. Tom Frieden,
I've enjoyed Twitter threads pandemic.

What we, individuals, ensure ready next pandemic, described WSJ Op-Ed? send form email local elected officials ""Please fund pandemic preparedness?"" addition, anything individuals prepare pandemics local level (without assistance government officials?"" mean, there's two products world called Sputnik. unless got satellite... Death rate Brazil spiking due uncontrolled spread, hospital systems collapsing (about week ten days ago, updates said Brazil running lot chemicals medicines, would translate steep death rate) they've using Chinese vaccines believed much lower rate efficiacy P1 mRNAs.

It's tragic, seeing Canada rough P1 get unvax'd population, highly unlikely spill world-crippling mass death scenario. There’s indoor spaces stadiums need funnel people through. Additionally, sports events smaller events parties also occur outside stadium. 2022 2023? state (Tennessee), many falling conspiracy theories, government officials/politicians talking opening state allow people states come get vaccine. believe vaccinations mandatory everywhere, unless note local medical doctor excusing you. honestly think need national vaccine registry similar sex offender registry. realize folks valid reasons getting vaccinated, many choose get vaccine, able eradicate virus. state, nearly educated one naive. example, there's reason chosen Manhattan Project. fellow Tennesseans, know Manhattan Project was, please open textbook section contains information history World War II history Tennessee 1940's.

So, national stupidity registry, er um, vaccine registry going something want avoid listed. Stop ignoring common sense simply saw someone knew trusted grocery store, park, church worrying virus changing DNA microchip installations. simply understand and/or studied science well enough. reason children die and/or become permanently deformed smallpox, polio, measles, mumps, diphtheria, etc, etc, etc. Why? People got vaccinated!

This vaccine rollout different emergency vaccine rollout. fact, safer, use weakened dead virus create immunity. Genetic mutations happen every day, day long, happening since beginning time. Doctors targeting DNA fight horrible, incurable illnesses years, thank God that! vaccine work like movie, ""The Fly"". going remove chromosome. going change half human/half virus. And, already microchips installed us. called teeth, faces, fingerprints. 

Residents Tennessee, please listen science medical doctors vaccine. Nurses nurse practitioners included! (My sincerest apologies advance nurses NP's across rest country across globe, say blunt fashion get people pay attention. Attention desperately needs paid issue speak, may issue ignorant parts Tennessee apply everywhere else. say though, think many understand why.) Many nurses nurse practitioners state Tennessee lack training needed communicable diseases, immunity, genetics understand vaccine works. also held significantly lower standard ethical responsibility workplace state ethical conduct doctors nurses often goes unenforced. ethical standards medicine enforced, doctors nurses held accountable, attorneys waste time, medical malpractice lawsuits filed. 

Let's honest, patients often leave ""doctor appointment"" thinking they've seen doctor actually seen nurse nurse practitioner. many nurses, education versus education medical doctor significantly less. opinion, number hours studied and/or worked degree light years smaller doctors telling everyone else get set Covid-19 vaccines. nurse NP Tennessee, really need giving advice Covid-19 vaccines trained medical doctors office giving, instead coming non-fact-based advice spreading conspiracy theories. know recommending Covid vaccinations. added sermon nurses NP's, hearing nurses Tennessee continue give non-fact-based information regarding vaccine, spread conspiracy theories, promote hydroxychloroquine cure Covid-19 (when better treatments available). nurses/NP's spreading conspiracy theories vaccine, much harder quash them. degree something used political agendas make friends spreading whatever ideologies appears popular patients. Unless think need keep patients sick make enough money, use degree dispute fake news help keep patients families healthy? 

So, yes, good ol' folks Tennessee call socialist saying it, think need national vaccine registry. worn mask public since mid-March 2020 even though masks mandatory county live in, rare disorder causing lungs (as well rest body) become paralyzed causes breathing problems even without mask. currently stands, us vaccinated folks come contact viral particles, thought still pass virus unvaccinated. Tennessee gets phases everyone's two weeks up, going continue wearing mask keep unvaccinated persons healthy. chance get vaccine... need people spending money goods services medical care. order give patrons boost right direction, businesses able discriminate people gotten vaccinated medical religious reason. would need app registry, patrons easily identified. political business leaders Tennessee need stand fight right order help us end epidemic. Medicaid needs expanded help believed false information coming vaccine, part info coming political business leaders well medical community itself. Tennessee anything state, disease continue spread, people continue lose lives and/or go bankrupt due medical bills, doctors medicine actually live ethical principles help people can't pay medical care go bankrupt and/or lose practices. Sucky situation, suck bad take action. like everyone does, say loud. mean might officers checking people masks everywhere go businesses, schools, government buildings require masks stuff that’s considered enforced me. Crying Chicago...I'm happy getting bit experience trying book appointments extended family, family nearly impossible. mean, kinda hard fully blame bars would less crowded without game happening/inviting fans area. said disruptive. humans. Us, including kids. Haha too!

Right now, definitely chunk it’s home life work conditions home. honestly **still** parroting fallacy relative privation bullshit? Lord. BYE! Oh no, wearing mask soooo hard. Get vaccine long majority things change Nah, two laboratories making 1 million doses per day. Pfizer supposed start delivering doses month Sputnik approved Anvisa (Brazilian FDA) bought doses also Brazilian laboratory making Sputnik vaccines.

But yeah, mass access vaccine probably coming July. vaccinated folk shouldnt quarantine. high levels anti-vaxxers. That's ""giving away doses"" foreigners, can't find enough people take them. doses gave away expire anyway. Commercially fair amount.

Non-commercially - hard drive border.

Flying otoh wide open. People got J J vaccine, long take feel absolutely completely normal after? place hired pulled would quit. They're upholding part employment agreement. It’s that. healing species. need less organized slavery. said adults get May, I’m young pre-existing conditions I’m getting Moderna tomorrow, walk get J&amp;J hour wait FEMA site. It’s rolling while! Yep. Tired seeing people like ""we cant fill $9/hour positions matter hard try!"" course—not saying it’s bad thing, making observation. little chores 5 minutes here, 5 minutes - stack waiting weekends. able @ home means weekends devoted wants rather needs. maybe Pfizer one. 

Brazil still vaccinating priority groups (Over 60s, healthcare, etc.), recently hit million jabs day. hurdle there's lot people country. Sounds like may need reconnect reality bit think gym memberships cushy. us lucky even get lunch break. You’re fine. recommended range Pfizer 21-42 days apart, worries realize many people would dead Spring fast spreading variants Trump didn’t push Operation Warp Speed? Trump saved tens thousands lives. Hardly anything pointless chatting office crew non-work issues. office funny people, go work, bs.  want distracting chatter, type completely random people.

The difference here, something post amuses get pick conversations. I'm done, logout - I'm control distraction. 

Hope things work you! F office. even socializing! role leaves tasks almost work anyone HQ office started at. international multi-state work email etc...boss another state goes office all. month would stop office barely 2 hours! 

There's communication done actual role work happened face face last two years covid. Stupid questions fix people's computers fire safety shit thing people talked about. 

I insane long commute, 70 miles public transportation that's driving, parking station, train 1-2 hours depending delays, free shuttle corporate park drive putting crazy miles car, stuck traffic can't work get ahead finish things up.

Just exhausting can't believe 5 days week years now. 

Honestly week would waste time money me. I'm spending $100-150 gas, tolls tickets week. $36 bucks round trip train driving. Hell fucking People one dose still get second dose problem first dose. confirmed briefing. reddit say?

Listen medical professionals Reddit. Lots people would rather quite full time office work. true before, too. quitting luxury people have, despite might say survey, people actually take thirty seconds think outcome. fairness, yes. getting numbers from? find found detailed efficacy data Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine publicly released** developer, Beijing Biological Products Institute, unit Sinopharm subsidiary China National Biotec Group (CNBG), said vaccine 79.34% effective preventing people developing disease based interim data. approved several countries including China, Pakistan one 34%. job fucking blows enough home. Fuck waking 4:30 make office. Gimps class pet personality traits want go back office life even remote level ‘excitement’. Fuck office. Fuck commute. Yeah, 10 weeks seems average far, remember correctly.  every country Sounds like double standards. AZ prioritizes domestic market expense foreign market, want SII prioritize domestic market expense foreign markets.

""One law me, another thee"" suburbs uniquely wasteful american thing.

What urban sprawl happen places like Paris London. uniquely ""america bad"" point view. Sure urban sprawl happens US countries say ""uniquely American"" true.In several China's biggest population density actually dropped people 'flee"" suburbs. literally making island Persian gulf put single family homes on.

People unhappy living downtown, buy ever sold, living within walking distance 3 hotdog vendors happiness.  Think many American drug commercials end lines ""side effects may include x, y, z... death"".

The population used marketed drugs side effects TV. would surprised effective vaccine low side effects application use rejected basis side effects.

Of course may apply reject basis US currently need extra vaccine. Well, I’d love to, obviously it’s highly individual. commute work 30 minute bike ride, I’ve close friends work don’t home office.

The question bit strange though; would anyone want work company compulsory 100% physical attendance? get work done, anyone care whete you’re at? Oh thank goodness, thought disappeared comment trying illustrate I've able successfully lose weight still able make time exercise due time constraints Covid placed family. 

That said, I've struggled losing regaining weight entire life. Trying get healthy hard freaking work, people want brag think well deserved. Everyone waiting U.S. save them. I'm one people know can't wait get back office. get much work done office.  earth voted? People reddit strange fortunately government smarter $9,000 max subsidy everyone Working home perfect me. 

If can't continue wfh find another job. mean theory shouldn’t incentivize people jobs realistically many people would show work didn’t get paid? Incentives work. find work? basically made argument government provided healthcare corporations treating workers like indentured servant clarity, seems like way worded applied even pre-Covid-19 world. says friends job, can't time friends.

I mean that—during work hours.

I interpreted comment mean shouldn’t allow coworkers replace actual friends *during work hours.* shitty spend life away people care about, people way out. took “just get discord” comment coming someone privilege spared fate.

On second read, seems like you’re advising look work substitute social interaction we’re missing pandemic, reasonable, also tough. Sweet theatrics.

He orders ban thing legislature could create. whole world conspired make Trump look bad! /s

Edit: ""Host ‘I’m Right’ First. Host nationally syndicated Jesse Kelly Show. Anti-Communist. Community college credits""

😂😂😂 would love able go office, feel like it. certain days crave human interaction 2 sides this. Since working home, ticketing slack channels gotten strict. put multiple tickets literal minutes long tasks engineers. tickets like this, obviously would put tickets even pre-pandemic knew lofty request patient. ones take minutes? ticket sits feel like it. Used able slack get done, wait, sometimes next day longer. get questioned I’m taking long job. can’t win, yeah, I’m 100% hybrid schedule. makes feel better, think also likely get either Moderna, Novavax J&amp;J - seems like going using AZ second doses mainly. Also think always wait, someone know offered AZ want initially asked could get Pfizer instead, told moment could wait. ended getting AZ like told AZ nothing. Saving gas money, getting sleep due commute, less traffic throughout day people working home. don’t see many negatives working home job allows still work. It’s competition. It’s discouraging travel foreign countries “surges” possibly exposing US citizens different variants wouldn’t otherwise exposed tracking back US. really think President United States democratic house senate worries technicality contract

How far we've fallen people upvoting this. Pro tip: Standards dropped hard across board there's rampant cheating. Remote learning new thing. work. nah, ""you resignation, effective immediately""

Aint point 2 weeks notice companies like that. happy keep fucking you. Fuck once. weird steps we've taken rendered flu nonexistent, cope overblown version flu.

Also strange almost nothing fight it, flu kills 1/10th people coronavirus does.  Either I’m math wrong, spent 97,920 dollars train tickets...... looks like trying bring back due feedback:  Great points around. think ever aware widespread narcissism was, general. think small slice people, think point, way rampant knew. I'm sure America inordinate portion, well, although hearing similar reports people live Brazil, France countries. senior manager, fucking idea need office tell people shit.

We weekly, monthly yearly KPI's. pretty clear performing. last job remote office company based another state. dozen people office, person team manager.

He retired, leaving person building part team. started working home.

Five entire months later, director team called said ""I heard coming in."" one team knew difference whether office home unless told.

After explaining reasons working home (not simply ""not working,"" made sound), told go office every single day. Working home impossible, despite fact someone else team already every day, knew people teams regularly.

So every day, three months pandemic hit company finally acknowledged serious (April 1), went office, sat desk, never spoke single person building standing microwave.

It improvement quality work, number hours worked, effectiveness team worked complete different states me. thing increase daily expenses make resent company more.

I checked last time drove by, office gone. Everyone still worked permanently working home. That's exactly need understand it. specifically AZ vaccine type? interacting something specific? hypothetical need research soon dispel doubts. ""It could nothing"" resume generating response. read article?

There issues removing indemnification sold/exported. realize 30000 average salary United States right?? touch reality. Making 125000 dollars enough. God damn, don’t live 5000 month rent apartment.  Italy starting tomorrow AZ vaccine 60 older second doses people know don’t want go back type get work done working home. think there’s healthy mix good bad. enough live city apparently wants spend days box people hate work clothes slept eat lunch people love everyday? Thank raising wage pressure point, seriously, going huge. Thank god I’m sales marketing hard outsource really need local cultural knowledge already starting work providers basically manage workforce specific tasks like graphic design countries wage 1/4th paying works. doesn’t foreign workers, competing someone rural setting...I think horrible lot people. students walking away teachers, someone stopping question might happening?

Why students want learn?

Teachers aware problem raising seniors, turn challenging develop curriculum regulate testing.

I think students interested learning need find why, work address problem engage students WANT learn. Population density Finland: 16 persons per km2.

Stockholm metro density actually lower Helsinki. blood tests myocarditis. dudes company make almost million per year lol alcohol since pandemic started. used drink office regularly. I've also lost 18 pounds presumably due less getting eating free bags chips every hour I'm bored never get it. $480 commuter train expenses per month plus knows much car insurance. take money spend rent closer work.

Right LinkedIN one top topics. Companies using WFH &amp; Hybrid recruiting point. 

My drive 14 miles way, taking 30-45 minutes way depending traffic (worse winters). *not* miss getting work 5pm, getting traffic backed miles get home. cubes non-wall 4 feet high, see everyone - hear everyone. coworkers (Devs) talk laugh half day. hate getting moving laptop conference rooms clickshare (at time) GotoMeeting. Trying find time day get lunch. Co workers bad hygiene habits (not washing hands using toilet), getting least 2 colds per year people come work sick. 

At home teams quiet home office focus without interruptions. Meetings snap they're scheduled, need something - teams chat anyone - anywhere world. get extra hour sleep every day - get 15 minutes work, log in, check emails, shower &amp; grab cup coffee. get breakfast &amp; lunch time need it. throw load laundry minutes odd chores usually would stack weekend. I'm able put productive 9 hours every day. I've put 2000 miles car last 12 months, filling maybe per month. cook food instead bring precooked, worse go eat. health improved, diet better, stress vastly reduced - two Jack Russells love time. 

I love working home hope company let us continue. said open offices fall - voluntary basis. We'll see. caused like 200k+ infections apparently weeks event

Lmfao white collar workers damn high maintenance lmfaooooooooo bolsonaro said many times, ""é sÓ uMa GrIpIzInHa"" commented earlier wanted track comment bc work public health lab department specializing covid they’ve antibody research. found vaccinated people WAY antibodies people covid haven’t vaccinated. coworker covid literally weeks tested antibody levels found 800, vaccinated people antibody levels 20,000+. wasn’t even rare case; coworkers tested positive antibodies rapid tests previous infections count taken really low. Sooo get opportunity would totally take you’re comfortable getting vaccine!!! Sorry wasn’t paying attention. let get straight: poor people cut expenses make things work city.. 60,000. making double year.! cannot live 60000 home costs living means.  *wealthy* enough work here, pal, keep moving. maybe close ones problems, monitor carefully. see earthly reason open schools tail end school year. logic that. focus everywhere needs mass vaccination. people hurry need something do, work logistics coming school year. security concern handling certain kinds data. graphic design advertising company way different handling code could result significant losses downtime hacked. Cosign country music fan, saw popping Twitter today - [looks like Eric Church planning tour indoor arenas starting he's part get people mean yea, really odd many peoples social interaction coworkers. 

I like want friends almost them. little common besides job, anyway. definitely want talk to. work related interaction office programs like Teams.

I feel like making friends via interests way better.

So yea, remote work way go. seen *so* much backcountry stupid last 12 months.

And places would go day without seeing another soul parking lots full overflowing morning.

(And I'm ranting, exactly country collectively decide leaving little baggies dogshit trailside acceptable practice?) would really cool get invitation haha. Fingers crossed. important gap manufacturing – simply enough vaccines, fix soon possible. See thread mRNA promising technology that.

Covid derailed many health programs, including immunization tuberculosis, unfortunately may see backsliding important global health issues. Covid vaccination program itself, done well, actually strengthen health public health systems. I'd rather quit continue working home tbh Exactly, company went work permanently. people complain want go back social interactions, it’s easier job anything like that. Productivity us gone since going remote. 48 year old husband :( Hopefully much longer... learned something people want full WFH, never would say actually work worse. always list arguments WFH better everyone.

And again, individual happier mean everyone is. team 5 works worse one happy worth nothing end. 

Hybrid models compromise increase happiness productivity everyone. WFH purists bad office purists. usual best solution always lies somewhere between. Thanks information. Good luck recovery weight loss. reality, going people. people heavier one thing other. 
 across almost income levels. people low incomes manage money well high income people one blown furnace away everything crashing down. friend's boss old lady wants go back office working. reason gives prefers like that.

It's pretty much wants socialize people suck her, according friends thinks office anyway. Jan 12, 2021 4406 per Google  seem want believe story, long confirms want hear.

Speaking of, none ""redditors"" idea OC's son actually hospitalized — they're ***assuming*** Arizona.

So, answer question, ***no***, there's reason believe random person reddit. ... ?? Get another job? don’t think means leaving workforce. coronavirusAz subreddit... Look, get criticising EU choosy beggers excluding eastern vaccines, think close conspiracy theorist comment thread. 
Do sources verify claim would act maliously (read: barring entry) people vaccinated this? can't really wrap head around that, would lead useless friction within outside EU. Sometimes good working others making millions brilliant business ideas would satisfy (or ability implement) wonder winter spike induced level herd immunity want hear regurgitated comments people day day never talk stuck there?

Societal Stockholm syndrome

Its like people never retire cause ""need work"" instead putting energy hobby learning comfortable existing i'd rather get paid workplace giving extra vacation days $200 bonus checks anyone bring proof vaccination. 

I’m taking former, I’m planning go Ireland goes well. True, used way, mean literally data support OP's link lmao fully understand recommendations. One it’s two weeks since second shot I’ll stop weekly tests. You’re acting like it’s wrong get test, I’m saying doesn’t hurt to. productivity increases modified work schedules, shown many studies, management likes even more. Language, communication style, cultural differences. experience pure hell times person thinks understand ooh boy don’t. think clear holy mother aren’t sure I'm right seems like never got ~4,500 day, article January 2021, think record beat yet  hope Covid unite rather divide us. published data Russian vaccine look forward seeing regulatory review data. seen limited data Chinese vaccines. vaccine, country, key publicly available, complete, standardized, reliable, data. Approval called stringent regulatory authority (SRA, US FDA EU EMA others) important bar vaccine jump over. Transparency key. Yes says they’d rather quit go back office full time. gonna survive without job? Can’t get stimulus checks forever. mask usage mandatory gym? messaging i've seen fully vaccinated, there's reason wear mask unless requirement, understandable can't know vaccinated course respect follow private business' guidelines.

It's honestly personal choice, know people double vaccinated wear masks choice even understand to, like said young healthy, double vaccinated, really hindering working staying fit, probably ease up. genuinely understand - WANT stay cooped inside homes entire workweek? Fuck Eh, sometimes monumental amount work. Bosses projects they're leading, initiatives, planning, budgeting, etc nevermind hr responsibilities etc etc. bosses anything, course. employees skate Yeah, probably figured out. obviously knew parking train. People job encouraged come back office 'as much possible'.
Personally, got strike performance review lack productivity (in large part due communication errors/general lack communication others including manager) thar blamed entirely working home full-time.
I given hard choice, implication pretty clear start coming least days week start looking new job. 

Also we've interviews new hire overheard zoom calls, every one heard willingness and/or ability come office comes one candidate soft struck lived hour away 'the commute would much'. Teacher. people realizing kids “check out” school, happens school too! pandemic issue, happened physical body still building. never want go back!!! vaccines becoming available company already announced expect back soon (gross) GENEROUS 1 day week work home. LOL!! either them, salespeople wanting able bulldozer product engineering teams updates instead waiting like non-psychopaths. +2.88M according Cyrus Shahpar versus +2.67M last Wednesday.

7 day average stands 3.02M, versus 2.99M yesterday. Nah never covid prepared get full whammy symptoms shot. live within walking / biking / scootering distance necessities (like lot people downtown areas) live far place work, entire reason owning car.

$300 / month car payment + $50 / month gas + $150 / month insurance...seems pretty reasonable actually. im sure everyone chronic illnesses pain would disagree. People already saying it. 50 years old probably 40 lbs overweight covid, currently 20lbs overweight. would doubt heart rate 70 high. done much exercise last 2 years need new hips got pushed back year due pandemic. surgery soon. think socializing hard lot people aren’t super outgoing gregarious. seems easier go work can’t life imagine it’s fulfilling social interaction. people might work people things common (age, education) I’m weirdo haven’t felt way since high school retail work. adult life I’ve tried relate people work talking dunno... TV shows don’t watch maybe handbags? It’s painful. I’m outgoing don’t lot common people work. best time make new friends new activities meet people?

Join league own? Post somewhere looking parents want hangout group?

Why would want interaction office instead somewhere whatever want say hi walking hallway definitely is. I’ve also seen tide turning. Friends skeptical gone gotten vax. Let’s hope others follow suit said son hospitalized arizona jan 15.  linked comment.

I merely copy/pasted actual comments claim proved right. don't. fault, problem. 

*shrug*

Godspeed, anonymous redditor. clarify, Coronavac name vaccine everywhere Sinovac name company. used drive 75 mile one-way commute home North Texas 5 days week. easily 90-minute drive one way. Since working shop, make probably 30% used to, drive 20 minutes one way. never, ever commute city ever life. Pick right place live outside city, everything want 35K year. People already preemptively defending position. looked weeks ago publicly available Thanks! universal vaccine now, efforts make one. time tell work - even they're needed, since vaccines effective, yet know vaccine-resistant different variants be.

Gaps vaccination coverage create problems, including emergence dangerous variants, avoidable illness death, continued economic disruption. Medications help already saving lives. See answer direct-acting antivirals one goal treatment, yet available. That’s really awesome. 48 hours. That's long closed. Vaccines 100 percent efficacy  made comment above, several top rating comment form ""this absolutely terrifies me"" 

I whipped top 20 top level comments, one said anything close that. rest sharing experiences discussion issue.

Seems like overreacting fringe commenters. see sort overall freakout, lot people talking disease seriously like should. Concerns really couple live vaccines. Covid vaccine live, data, guidance consistent adult vaccines. 

1. CDC making recommendation currently [we lack data safety efficacy COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously CDC might update guidance information available.
2. However, NEEDED, COVID-19 vaccine given shorter interval vaccines, example measles hepatitis vaccine needed post-exposure prophylaxis (to prevent illness exposure), avoid barriers delays COVID-19 vaccination.
3. general, [ACIP evidence inactivated vaccines interfere immune response vaccines, administered simultaneously time different vaccine, two exceptions (meningitis pneumococcal vaccines certain circumstances). I've telecommuter ~8 years - took lot work get point, made work me.

It good change - office bullshit, talking local sports team high volume, gossipy coworkers (for late 30s guys, gossiped lot), interruptions. Private bathroom, fully stocked fridge preferred snacks, better view, better commute.

It's interesting see change workscape everybody remote. jobs hiring remote roles, also ton applicants. common question used be, ""have worked remotely before?"" assumed.

I've current role 2 years, met teammates once, despite talking via zoom week. Thanks! Yeah, understand one guarantee this, givens here. registered report back get contacted. feel like there's corporate astroturfing going thread. many people using exact language. I'm 1 3. boss stated they're going back office five days week, full-time anything less ""company's way."" we're tech company. always fan hybrid remote work model I'm pursuing full-time opportunities elsewhere. COVID shown much productive home, much time wasted commute, much present family (my son born last year relationship incredible sees day, every day). sounds like really good system. company working consolidate single office building right pandemic. idea going fit even then. space everyone out, seems impossible. already challenge book meeting room. 

I hope never go back. would *maybe* voluntarily go back week.  Encouraging right. old management wanted ""hallway talk"", mandating two days encouragement five. (I think lonely.) 66% probably 2+ small children home covid back January, state longer restricts people based last tested positive (outside last 14 days). covid? I'm expecting get whole fever/headache/aches things we'll see. least home work hit. hundreds hundreds work associates I've worked positive terms I've met maybe like 5 could build actual friendship with. Work work. forced relationships proximity note Full day meetings get stuff done. _have_ meet 4 different groups throughout week, better line one day knock out. actually get rest week focus, instead losing momentum context switching getting nowhere day.

I'm software dev, worst thing let get started work tell pause hour two later. tell open visual studio Tuesdays cuz we're meetings I'll happily answer business questions day knowing leave alone 4 days that. Agree completely. spend time Internet analyzing failings france's covid response. already tough give benefit doubt year ago: pandemic unexpected elected office accountable (especially considering fact despite Italy getting hit hard weeks France, Macron still telling French media people needed go out).

Now, lack preparation criminal.

Not even talking hospital lockdown.

Last week, macron closes School starting following week. year pandemic one could thing public School online system would prepared.

Lol crashed immediately. think that's management, either work somewhere poorly run, work unskilled labor. Scientists need cheerleaders I'll take generation event day BS dealt there. 12 hour days, 3 days week office much better WFH 5 days week  health economics cost-effectiveness side things.

Doing bang-up job far 🤣

Just kidding! glad good stable job hope hang onto it. Cheers! Meanwhile NYS still one. go Texas summer? ridiculous bullshit that's even applicable country, clearly US

My mother telling ""Watch covid disappear day Biden takes office"" blew mind. never even US! understand Americans dismissing rest world's experience covid we're UK! UK, recently US, conservative governments, apparently conspiracy right wing governments embarrass... erm... right wing governments! Oh boy ..

Company says would like employees social skills able meet face face coworkers clients time time ..

^^ guy: “STOP OPPRESSING ME” look it. doc thinks heart inflammation numbers improving slowly surely giving time. quitting go back. Nothing value office expenses wasted time me. Everyone know pushing full return type person bullshit around water cooler day long. I'm opposite, would rather quit stay full time remote. collaboration anymore. can't bounce ideas people. understand recognize everyone different. exact situation (My work computer home computer I'm always place etc. etc.) never issue setting boundaries ""This work. home"". flick work switch go life I'm done day. physical location issue, thats recommended taking laptop Starbucks something. go office. think give people choice prefer. I'm that. 

The issue prior choice barely existed. cases, still many cases office. Many people way productive, focused enjoy extra time less stress WFH. get defensive people blaming WFH problem personal preference lack boundaries. gives companies easy excuse offer it. choice. gives everyone flexibility want. dumb. famous leader said, “no testing, cases”. Death hospitalization much less easily manipulated, Japan much older Europe don’t think age anything really. daily commute roughly 45 minutes working home saved 7 days conscious life. 7 days now, 7 business days, 24 man hours X 7. 
and 45 minutes considered bad commute. 
Fuck shit. Etihad likely retire entire fleet retiring half fleet much capacity much efficient A350 787. Big money loser since significantly undercuts average seat pricing  That's hell utility bill, mind asking extra expenses coming from? Working home gobbling $300 extra power, right? Yeah - first understanding communication- maybe I’ll repeat - science doesn’t care think beliefs, created free that. understand people frustrated science doesn’t answers everything it’s problems eg research it’s actively fighting problems way ever before. Problems understanding usually connected limited knowledge scientific research, read compare data. Scientific consensus people saying media, writing magazines arguing Reddit. It’s couple research contradicts ocean other. Calling climate change “hysteria” contradictory scientific consensus - absolute majority scientists field. 
Reading science easy mistaken many times please mistake opinions science. True, cost thing companies considering. Otherwise everything would outsourced. plenty benefits local workers companies weighing pay higher wages. think fact almost US workers decent experience working home evens playing field. Companies want lower labor costs still want benefits local workers new option. think lot jobs best suited local remote workers rather foreign ones.  live MInnesota hrs border outside semis Canada...I’ve seen maybe 2 3 Canadian vehicles interstates last yr. usually it’s every car normal times I'll wearing mask flu season on, I'm support staff i'm forced around everyone office, used come bronchitis every year since started working office environment. 


Last two seasons come it. always hope people leaving dog shit planning coming back turn around hike back. wouldn’t (and don’t dog) understand wanting carry shit longer to. 

Of course, people could plan understand part hiking dog means carrying dog’s poop, maybe that’s expecting much people. Interestingly, I've remote I've found schedule fills calls multiple people get pulled half hour call would take five minutes two people resolve face-to-face. Oh no. guess continue 33 year hiatus vacationing Canada. someone works German healthcare system (nurse), may worst, government every connected department little clue appear completely go ""just wing it"". 
One time this, time something else shortly something different on. 

""Hey, information regulations you"" - least 2 different departments information/regulations different other.

Hairdresser allowed visit patients retirement homes, medical podiatrists weren't. stuff like throughout everything.

Sometimes quarantine COVID-19 positiv patients 5 days, others 11 days, others 14 on. People still suffering symptoms released quarantine, since ""well, 5 days over, ok."" stuff like that. 
It one reasons massive outbreaks retirement homes.

My stepdad tested positiv quarantine 3 days tested still positive. mean, wtf? 
Then prolonged quarantine total 7 days. 
My brother mom quarantine 12 days, 14 days. live household. 
My mother vaccinated, since working nurses, kind understood want necessarily test us, (I would liked tested, make sure), ""fight"" would least test brother, partly contact stepdad got tested positive. 
And household got handled like this. 
What different us, apparently first case 2 vaccinated people lived 4 person household someone tested positiv. public health department clearly told us unsure handle this, situation expected. 
I mean, that's something one thought about, right?

I even want talk economy. say though ""reports"" say rather stable, bad seems. Yeah, big companies affected, reports usually fail look smaller companies, suffering. 
Their income survive ""help funds"" government arriving way late. even cases small companies pay back funds, since government suddenly decided cover anymore. Imagine small company (4 5 people) close due lacking income. suddenly pay back 9k€ money have.

And list keeps going on.

As stated, may worst, shitshow far good press people want claim be. Ontario, people working home getting tax credit $400. Still trying figure why. France mandatory mask mandate outdoors everywhere, except exercising (biking, running, etc.). fine 135€. reason see wearing mask helps put people mindset respect social distancing. Sucks, lots people would mighty greatful empty positions. God bless people quitting let someone else take jobs though. Thanks sharing this, interesting data. quarter population getting vaccinated need 85%to get herd immunity, plus there's variants so... Idk vaccine rollout seems like testing rollout. I'm upset government says get vaccine day x, takes month get concrete appointment. summer acting intensive past attended also making vaccination mandatory in-person learning. Honestly thought it'd higher. fellow co-workers want go back office really ever again. work productivity 11.5 percent according last office virtual meeting. Allegedly tho company thinking going back normal working condition June. We're mostly happy it. guy ended going packed BLM protests month later! alright cause wearing mask guess. I’m placing put contract viruses. suck what, exactly? Nothing covered up. Whitty literally mentioned TV weeks ago. Plus young people vaccinated far, whereas countries gave vaccine young people due claims less effective old people.

Not liking Boris mean need lie situation. would say what’s going sometimes discuss ideas decide implement either end don’t think work bad idea feel much opposition general public. Yeah sounds exactly like one old companies work environment believe it. time, ‘laid-back holiday’ parties still work environment social setting IMO. usually would skip event, go, would still boring. huge company, agency life allowed flex inside office laid-back holiday parties, except actually laid-back time.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* forget exact statistic, relatively close found Gen X basically averaged 28 years company Millennials average like 2.4 years. 

Mostly cited work generational culture shifts. 

Personally think biggest reasons employers going back great depression mindset treating employees numbers easily replaced, lost ability forgiveness, vastly different benefits companies, stagnating wages. variants control provinces. P1 B117 variants growing exponentially. we’ve vaccinated small percentage. It’s mostly spreading young people age based vaccine roll people 70+. opportunity go office would selling point me. 5 days week, even 1 day would good change. I'm currently building support staff company literally invested 10 million dollars interior fit building. responsible office move pandemic. 


They trying like hell get people come back work office, completely open floor plan workstations crammed elbow elbow. 


Talk timing. surely socialising 40 hours anyway, regardless are. hour day max right? feel like isn’t want   Said another WFH thread here, want go back either. time got spend WFH'ing absolutely great. commute office, sleep able sleep in. also like socializing co-workers great well get avoid that. What's love?

Now get called ""shut-in"" introvert liking working office liking socializing co-workers, look many friends outside work I'd rather spend time socializing with. anything common co-workers outside fact work place. Socializing co-workers lot times forced. fact happy hours thing psudeo-required come annoying. Even pre-pandemic always first leave office go see friends go dinner fun stuff. I'm work job, socialize fake co-workers.

Working home normal times would fantastic. office drama politics. socialize co-workers want socialize spend time with. lack commute would allow able find easier stuff hang friends, ie people actually like socialize spend time with. It'd perfect normal times.

The problem WFH necessarily WFH, fact fun activities outside work restricted right now. barely see friends, that. concerts, bars breweries likely open heavily restricted. issues normal times, thus WFH would much better normal times boring may seem now.

People daily thread get really defensive reason someone posts comment talks WFH enjoyable good, quite funny. Look, get people like working office also people rely solely co-workers social stimuli (which could never works someone fine), reasons people also like WFH also anti-social shut-in liking WFH. fact, quite opposite me. Anything makes easier spend time friends, people actually like socialize spend time with, plus me. hand, friends company can't seem wait get everyone back office 

I theory this... think makes ""management"" look bad. Think it... lot managers much beyond ""keeping eye people"" turns people really need micro-mangement... probably save money letting bunch managers go.

I think small companies better it; excess management nothing babysitting staff. Everybody gaff looking forward going back work, actually quite happy staying home, saving travel costs enjoying shuffle commute upstairs downstairs.

The reason employer would want employee office crunch death.   Rights absolute. line right privilege illegality determined moral views, like say.  extremely privileged able quit work office again.

You financial security job security land new position easily... Please post data trackers articles tracking number cases vaccines administered/delivered. types links posted Daily Discussion thread comment. sure. I’m saying that’s it’s illegal. It’s hard justify whether that’s choice job chose, compensation correct etc. Thank you. I'm shocked. link please? Please don’t let trend. I’d rather remote Denmark Seems hypocritical think private businesses required business want to.  I'm early 40s working one company 20 years. know I'm unicorn think union job contributes considerably. Decent pay, good benefits, work sucks point either stay start bottom management somewhere else, neither prospects sounds appealing.  I’ve saving least $200 commuting alone mention often bought breakfast lunch. monthly savings likely $500. course, I’ve spent hell lot shit didn’t need cannot stop shopping online. Rising cases, variants, slow vaccine Don’t worry Canada it’s you, it’s us. need find figure things out. cnn report cdc director discussing decrease deaths One thing miss work free printing photocopying. Driving work like driving mall, ""choose save gas."" job. literally get compensation, say ""the resources used engage said job impact compensation"" ridiculous.

51 major corporations paid less dollar taxes 2019. think afford pay time. hell stupid companies allow people work home permanently? obviously works fine. group people live postage stamp wfh situation cramped easily distracted need away tv, hobbies, etc focus.

Bingo. I’m never 10 feet away work computer, matter go apartment. I’d rather work computer office, bring home days worked home.  Nope. I’d love full time wfh could put 6 hours vs 8 hours still get paid same. hate waiting around, work slowly look busy clock hits 3. work construction management WFH isn’t feasible 75% time. Definitely jealous full time wfh people who’ve living easy street past year! country ? didn’t tell he’s risk. told children asymptotic. know anxiety is? know many times kid asked promise he’ll never get COVID-19? can’t promise something can’t know. promise careful, wash hands, wear mask social distance public somehow get sick promise take care feels better. adults state responsible pandemic wouldn’t gotten control.  NJ Transit? sounds like lazy use tools given responses I've read literally coworkers suck. know likely.

Just man learn communicate internet instead person dude, literally hard. Children it.  change fact zero reason hold onto second doses. best states that. Similar thing here! wife became disabled January 2020 can't help around house much anymore. WFH quite literally saved marriage.


Those 2 hours got back commute used house maintenance now. used consume free time taken care extra time back. actually enjoy free time end night spend time family again.


If make us come back office again, I'll quit. job worth marriage. saw virus drinking piña colada Trader Vicks. It’s hair perfect.  100%



For months working trying take care 1.5 yo 3yo. Please, please, PLEASE GOD NO!!!

When I'm trying work, kids amazing, also need time adults understand basic social cues, boundaries, damn paw patrol wait 2 minutes takes finish phone call.  boss sounds like boomer, can’t imagine genX millennial manager promote way - they’ll look results.  not? mean, they'd probably tried get jobs without nearly pay increase anyway call times too. ""I'm allowed wear mask I'm drinking!"". *quickly grabs another beer* Meanwhile company actually increased travel middle pandemic. work regional field rep, started January last year told road travel would 3-5 days month. since translated 20-25 days road, month.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thanks, that’s useful input.  UK went heavy 1st dose strategy 12 week delay 12 weeks lots people expect 2nd shot April. continue giving 1st doses pace they'd need double supply. much exactly expecting really know UK government hides delivery information public. Americans super-spreaders sorts misinformation. official non-official. It’s called “talking book”. Pathological messaging money norm US. agree guy replying to. end year US probably exported vaccine doses anyone else. They're already track produce 2 billion doses. shit. long we're going to. person struggling keep kids wearing masks socially distanced need protection ourselves. ""Eat berries find poisonous.""

You're imbecile. Kind like african leader said pray Covid away... died Covid! Walmart stopped enforcing mandatory masks 5 days. Missouri. went eat months back didn’t realize taken table restaurant back full capacity customers masks. two.  Thank response, genuinely means lot right now. I’ll best here, stay safe stay healthy friend guys vaccinating teachers (many 20's 30's) people aged 65+?

Close comparisons made UK similar vaccination rates per capita - they've got 97 percent older age groups already.   CA lowest positivity rate per Newsom country worked even rough patches along way. I'm curious - uni/s thinking of? Yeah, seems get soon mate. SARS-CoV-2 fucking joke. 

Five months going covid diagnosed asthma - without using inhaler lungs loose half liter capacity. get random fits cough real reason. Yesterday got weak tired vaccuming apartment. sex life suffered well (now inhaler proper medicine got better, thankfully) since go hard long used half-year ago. 

I almost dozen tiny lumps (below 2 millimeters circumference) scattered around lungs slowly absorbing one tell precisely long take disappear. doc advised autopsy thing monitor regularly. 

I trouble falling asleep I'm groggy disoriented hour waking up. harder focus performance work slightly dropped result. 

Before infection used panic attack every month - every week. also get stressed agitated easily, pisses end I'm (used be?) generally pretty laid back. Oh, slightly depression meds got noticeably worse weeks infection. 

I lost appetite sometimes forget eat stomach starts hurt get hunger-nauseous (that one semi positive gained unnecessary kilograms due lockdowns self imposed isolation). 

I can't wait see else got/will get messed body! /sarcasm Hahaha brilliant. Emirates nice stadium least enjoy :P  US hardly exports vaccins. factory plants located Europe. Sure Pfizer Moderna headquarters US headquaters save lives. expert , yet speak like one scold users one.  given vaccine rollout strategy, would bet doesnt happen summer. reality staying trickle coming out,

About 50% vaccines produced EU exported, time EU severe vaccine shortages due AstraZeneca. strain likely developed first place without massive amounts transmissions UK govt allowed occur .

Sure there's degree (bad)luck involved, slow spread drastically reduce likelihood occuring Thanks, points well taken. fully agree! Yeah US said can't prove it, bit difficult situation.

I kind wish would find link reason causes people. would better random rare chance. Get yourself. Meanwhile, Australia, teachers childcare workers last get it. next year rate. Could get DM well? assumes amount exposed large numbers equal roughly size groups. kind means thing. It’s saying 5% get assumes 5% exposed get it… effectively obviously everyone group get it. Well Sweden projected Tegnell countries including Brasil... another side things.

Brasil combination mutated Trump/Tegnell strain pandemic response! take day time, mate. Get tested. Knowing vital, knowing drive anxiety take mind negative trajectory. Isolate last year keep occupied order fall pit negativity. point jumping conclusions worrying future. need put night behind beat it. Take day time, man. Good luck. affordable healthcare people actually still money name get fucked system Maybe prefer mass grave? problem reactor still fully save there, built massive concrete casket around it.. Fukushima worse... 

Simply around reactors areas uninhabitable long time. case Tschernobyl, bad, wild life thriving nature recouping area.  clearly stated personal opinion. personal opinion likely pretty well-informed.

This sounds like case squabbling within EMA (“how dare share individual views we’ve officially determined group position!”) talking shit. one brought pedantic pointless line discussion reason. least take responsibility it. Idea. speculate causes like people following rules taking precautions think ad-hoc reasons cos see difference people behaved say December-january. Perhpas seasonal thing? winter perhaps virus spread easily? maybe new strain? dont think know answer anytime soon, speculations interview read director vaccination site said they’re anyone. Without getting politics much, school located area heavily populated covid deniers, way vaccine need local (willing) population. One staff member spoke around noon said they’d already seen 2000 people probably 1800 town. They’ve people LA, SF, even Las Vegas show up. plenty doses encourage anyone come. Yes right.... thanks clarification. Sorry incorrect facts, intentional.  Yes, one washing hands pandemic. Well carriable multiple animals hard tell leapt humans. tiring. People sense risk management. Yes, we're pandemic...but things important too. love getting downvoted suggesting balance risks... Presumably he, others meeting, already seen data discussing.

They may officially reached position group yet, suspect personal opinion pretty well-informed. Masks goes trash get vaccinated. own. Honestly quite appalling see given little bit validation justification, will, quickly turn treating people like dogshit.

Punitivism terrible policy. also ton cross border families. live globalized world. People need get around. first vaccines UK got Pfizer one one given frontline workers. Every healthcare worker know got Pfizer jab know lot due mum MS.

At moment mainly using AZ 50's. started vaccinate people 50 yet large scale.

Also said UK seen types clots Pfizer jab numbers small realm would seen general public anyway got jab not.

I normally conspiracy anyone half brain pretty clear people want AZ succeed got funny feeling money AZ sold cost easy move around kept fridge. going vaccine gets us mess, pharmaceutical companies going loose money. Hey that’s great Nothin really stopping us. contract clause applies states, federal government. Love word allowed like people wouldn’t anyways. Get straight authoritarian vibes phrasing like that. reason recent enormous surge India? months infections went down, seems like getting worse ever. Hoarding vaccines good thing. best thing. great great grandfather hoarded huge amounts vaccines. clever man. Nobody else got vaccines him. millions them. Millions. Bolsonaro fellow.

But, know sounds brutal anyone familiar cold scientific thinking people like Tegnell, Sweden also lot vulnerable old people expected COVID hit. expected significantly higher death rate 2019/2020 flu season never materialised. people stand chance Sweden lost control spread care facilities.

This also seen numbers. 13,533 deaths currently listed FOHM website, 12,259 70+ age group. AZ vaccine garbage, absolute fucking garbage!. Tinder? Boring.
University? Dutch English, English level equal primary school. Dutch okay.
Hobby's? im allowed practice martial arts, museums closed.
Volunteering? week lower risk.
My internship? Uni banned leaving country infection risk, even though Ive disease vaccinated leave (september).
Fitness? Lmao none.
Ye. real lockdown hours. EU disadvantage due much denser lifestyle (apartment buildings, public transport, dense cities) older population. think really badly US pandemic control, even reflected deaths. mean, EU anti-masker leader.

Anyway EU also pretty bac job, plus much worse US vaccines, like lessons give US. websites suck. 

I trying get second shot can't remember password. 

I can't create second account says mailed password reset, nothing inbox, spam folder deleted items filter domain. Yeah, real problem going start finding wearing off, does, months everyone starts wearing off. Oh god..... stop, guys. might still enough teachers. may take another five six months schools reopen anti American circle jerk continues. sick it.  “can still vaccines please”. Right?

Stop blaming 300+ million people 50 million idiots. Plenty countries fucked winter, nobody seemed give shit then. they. much hipocracy.  governor mandates schools? schools whatever want Better. progressive. thing. America isn’t 600k yet. Europe, however, passed number Ah lifelong thing case. Wow....that’s crazy!  Y'all whatever want, continue use I've learned pandemic avoid pathogens, pollen pollution. None things done good, ever. like things, :) Ummm, Europe 610,000 dead. That’s 556,000 America. Honestly I’m entirely sure much benefit would have. don’t know whole lot people fence Covid, either people board taking seriously they’re insistent it’s overblown amount evidence persuade them. want wear mask, go ahead. force other, healthy people? Never said was, said restrictions continue ease full reopening. someone says lockdown, means stay home order, maybe that's something else? business allowed open mean lockdown. Exactly. would want drive 30min way rush hour sit chair zoom calls mostly global teammates could home save time money. really add up. least ten percent already sent Indonesia. Plaque brain [a hallmark kinds plaque sign Alzheimer's Disease. bad thing.

I've never even heard COVID vaccine causing it. Looks like deep-rooted issue American distrust government. Can't say blame them, especially looking Republican party fact two parties represented parliament. Still, see government knowing whether vaccinated getting country closer authoritarianism. Especially since important pandemic over. wife needed pacemaker ever since infection? temporary? would believe data coming Florida? They’ve caught several times screwing data reduce apparent infection rates. discriminatory vaccines readily available anyone. Meaning vaccinated grandparents may able travel, wont, demented government supplied enough vaccines everyone.

The thing is, safety important enough justify what's basically temporary discrimination. Freedom right, alive... policy requires constant, perfect mass compliance order effective, it’s terrible policy. Upstate ny here. bad all, stuff like restaurants obviously movie theaters restricted capacity biggest change probably schools person. Though people restrict many want crowded places check numbers every year pay fucking taxes. “We pay this” shit that’s taxes for. least I’ll know may taxes going something helpful people lost family fucking virus. vaccinated already, worry quarantine.  Yes. Works fine long use something touch lips pinch nose. sick. really requiring companies give sick days. 

Otherwise no. facial expressions huge social interaction mask waste going hurt environment keep up. Everyone else blundering around you. know now! New data last week shows rare. vaccines [reduce even asymptomatic infections infected can't spread it. Maybe three four generations make sure grandkids grow extra eyeball. Imagine living like this. venezuela people diying covid young old, government nothing vaccines, hospitals full even medical personal vaccinated yet, insane, family, friends neighbors dying sick can't take anymore need solution top economic crisis getting worst many people can't afford go work eat day Perhaps immune system takes time respond first dose? wonder much immunity six weeks first dose, get second dose. lockdown?? honestly believe current state business different February 2019, you’re insane. see how. privilege, rights... Sorry, right. Didnt see ""fully"". ~600 thousand deaths. 

If that’s commendable you, words. act like people responding data new projections flip flopping goalpost moving also somehow bad thing?  better somebody, fault own, received COVID vaccine? surprised. kind thought pervasive sub.

This better. safer... need full life cycle kid. Get back 85 years. This. allocated fair amount $2000 legislation required funeral homes accept much like Medicare reimbursements. 

I desire subsidize one corrupt businesses existence. great USA! 🎉 

I hope better Mexico 🤦🏻‍♀️ Recommend reading official sources understanding (background first) efficacy rate based chance getting infected exposed virus. non-vaccinated person exposed virus large enough dose would likely get infected Pfizer vaccinated person 5% chance though varies based virus (but non-vaccinated). odds everyone time exposed, 95% population never get infected 5% will. 

So vaccinated become infected (what's discussed here)? seems like body able mount defense quick enough prevent viral load getting high enough really infect another person. person may feel somewhat sick days even chatting someone maskless coughing, may spreading much virus air. 

That said, vaccinated, would take chances obviously sick person, especially test positive, even person vaccinated. I'm vaccinated though really personally worried continue careful everyone wants vaccine chance get fully vaccinated. [Surprise - guess isn’t true. least misleading. plenty systems place vaccination tracking, including new Tiberius system. 

So system generate passports today? No, could easily one. Paper cards aren’t best do. It’s moment, isn’t need yet. passports won’t “required”domestically, likely preferred point future private companies. 

And international travel, need quick, easy, verifiable way make sure travelers vaccinated.  federal database, state maintaining one.

Isn't problem healthcare systems? NY, accident journey California? It’s experimental. Less one year out. even vaccine?  new variant defeats vaccines setting us back 0.

I’ll happy working office space coffee shop again. Flu, like Covid, respiratory disease. inhale droplets somehow. unless snorting food packages, highly unlikely get infected way. I'm leaning towards Michigan ATM. Metro-Detroit, especially Port Huron area struggling. I've heard testing 20% positive Covid tests, yet school districts open students site.

I can't speak Sault St Marie area, Covid spread last year lower Michigan traveling, I'd guess probably open either. Or, perhaps, people start getting locked fucking part congregating, wearing masks right, etc. wise man said many time, ""Its time Gooooo!"" seasonal flu also infinitesimal chance spread surfaces. stuff like E Coli norovirus spread via surfaces resume travel one country requires vaccine passport country vaccinate people 30 earliest September later year. Maybe simply country won’t offer vaccine passport. would travel then? big news. I'd like mandatory international public transportation, optional domestic public transportation. Maybe offer perks incentivize people mask domestic flights, along little reminders respiratory illnesses lowered masking, well disposable masks available every plane anyone wants them. exaggerating California. Schools closed whole year. county last week elementary Ed get go back. 4 hours week. Jr high back high school yet. That’s year school study University Chile found inoculation 56.5 percent effective protecting recipients two weeks second dose, 27.7 percent effective within first two **But single dose, efficacy 28 days first second dose three percent -- par margin error studies, Researchers looked combined effect Coronavac, accounts 93 percent doses administered, Pfizer-BioNTech estimated Coronavac's efficacy real-life conditions 54 percent -- line trial results Pfizer jab estimated 94 percent effective Israeli study.

Basically useless 1 dose (3% efficacy) sounds like Chile 2. 56% (after 2 doses) great huge difference 3%, sure big gap. silly analogy. 45 year old friend died pancreatic cancer year. flu kill someone less 3 weeks. I'm sure length time die matters, go. flu kills lot less people covid, paying funerals flu deaths lot cheaper give $9,000 someone died covid nothing someone died flu? people died covid? That's good reason.

NY doesn’t political re-close, aren’t going announce full reopening yet, although they’ve making steady progress. tourists coming Florida states. Facui predicted

Holy shit dude, God something? Maybe look like Nostradamus type figure?

I thought saw day... think it’s important make people aware COVID isn’t risk death severe disease.

This one things think key messengers including Dr. Fauci failed sufficiently do: make clear substantial risk long-term health consequences even wind hospitalized.

It sort reminds politicians tend focus number combat veterans died, reality far psychologically physically damaged terrible ways essentially ruin lives. masks break give rashes. keep slipping nose slide eyes hard time positioning right. inhibit communication remove basic nonverbal cues. also difficult deaf people rely people's lips lipread. school district, vandalized office one school board members voted school sports COVID metrics improved. headline uses direct quote Dr Nicholelis, in:
“'It’s nuclear reactor set chain reaction control. It’s biological Fukushima,' said Miguel Nicolelis, Brazilian doctor professor Duke University, closely tracking virus.”

Nicholelis neuroscience specialist, infectologist. IMHO, made comparison Fukushima stablish kind progression death numbers, like nuclear chain reaction, since numbers daily new cases daily death growing exponentially. go overall death rate US clearly densely populated places suffered most. suspect rural areas US relatively high rates density levels bc number factors. tend anti restrictions, higher levels poverty also higher levels obesity. Even given that, densely populated overall much higher death rate even though restrictions much tougher places. simp guns less likely use 'covid shot' 80% travel Canada land US border handful competently run states. might get Texans back, I'm sure Washington New York work something out. Nobody denying everything. put lives hold year ago greater good. at-risk protected threat virus diminishes every day. want start getting lives again, sit around waiting another X months. safe start heading direction instead locking away avoiding human contact.  easier trace back team sports classrooms? Kids need taught what's necessary continue love. high school mom made spend couple summers farmhand out-of-state, missed summer football training/camps teammates attending. sucked. still worked out, though, I'd lost spot didn't.

Shit, kids sports even they're still home -- off-season. COVID, during. close-call conflicting priorities. obesity card work here.  I'm sure premise sending vaccines 5 states helps people already virus. might want step Tamiflu respirators goes south. understanding solid 8 weeks vaccine works. article also draws conclusion states vaccinations less infection provides data (not every state let's everyone get vaccinated). Sometimes feel like people get article door much way critical thought. Agreed. We're getting end year latest.  funeral industry big unethical money suck. supporting them? people want wear them, sure. gonna weird lot people go back regular life get colds office/their friends/their kids thinking masking prevent lol.

i hope normalize paid sick leave without consequences tho USA, way impactful ""yeah sure come work norovirus wear mask!"" (and upgraded ventilation schools/offices/etc would nice i'm sure that's happening) ""full term""? That's generally considered term art scientific research. current Phase 2/3 trials kids sufficient? think getting it. think bad policy. bad policy Katrina. bad policy 9/11. bad policy now. course, Katrina 9/11 deaths REALLY matter. we're talking half million people. real money. gets serious. say people pay funerals that's always been, I'm talking 99% private deaths paid FEMA reason.

Always have. want change that, need way helps people, certain causes death, need make sure create moral hazard encourage people get expensive funerals would money. Good point. vaccinated transform full moon, we're gonna need silver bullets get. Totally agree ways keep active! realistically, lot kids group sport really love keeps active.

At son's school kids COMPLY. police other. 

Adults' mask compliance far worse ages 6-14. FAR worse. It’s lie. Oh, crying loud! Ontario, bad bechmark overall performance, never 15% vaccines undistributed last big delivery, vaccines laid undistributed pretty much allocated already.

 non-issue look actual usage statistics. Whatever delivered, administered quickly. things delivered, would administered quickly well. think argument ""slower rollout"" holds water. Plenty blame pass around. Reagan dead though. I'll focus guy white house actually thing now. Really? When? source that?

I know province expects done first doses around time second dose heard federal government still aimed end September. It’s lie. valid practical reason mask requirement already explained. agree here, *so* many issues contractor.

There’s going waste sorts contracts, least product show waste. Versus money spent nothing show.

If anything need factories like inevitable clunkers among don’t represent much problem own.

It’s ultimately fair say there’s issue 8 years ago US authorized spending factory pandemic vaccines 8 years haven’t able produce vaccines. bad passed law banned exercising except group sports vanishingly legit medical exemptions mRNA vaccines. contraindication list short. vaccine probably less effective people cancer (weakened immune system). get vaccine father still high risk. can't go 5 minutes without reminded deadly is.

Of course people test positive going traumatized. Can't hug family test positive deadly virus setup good mental health. mean see you’re grumpy, I’ve yet see enforcement mask mandate IL yet. I’ve worked 40+ hours weekly front lines since start this, don’t see people caring. Oof, best luck. long ago vaccinated? that's colleges, example, intend far know, courses designated online fall 2021 stay online regardless (massive) improvements situation likely coming next 4-5 months. That's discouraging hear four half months start semester much improvement COVID situation happening happening next months. university really needs flexible open-minded planning.

Also, I've told faculty, university expects social distancing, masking, capacity limits still mandatory (on-campus least) fall. great progress we've made vaccinations, combined extremely good effectiveness vaccines, confused think measures still place then. really feels like end-game start spring 2022 semester, campus open 100% again. law biden reactivating passed signed law reagan. want blame anyone moral hazard, ought blame ronnie Yes, please.

You clearly know talking about. Stop. absolutely story friend’s son. early 30s too, healthy young guy underlying illnesses doc quack Underwear mask butt. Take that, antimaskers! always possible variant arises gets around somehow, method vaccines operate **very** robust variants, reason said above.

It attacks method virus attacks human cells.

Variants modify process... probably can't infect human cells.

Variants don't... susceptible vaccine.

Again, always possibility novel ability get human cell evolves, unlikely. look NYC, something like 25% cases reported probable included top line number. absolute number stayed roughly constant around 1000 per day since beginning year, even though PCR positives PCR positive rates halved time. find ridiculous 4% test positivity, anybody unable find PCR test confirm diagnosis. Anyway, people positive antibody test, exposure known COVID positive patients, random unexplained deaths go bucket. 11 months ago bucket use since nobody could get tested, it’s comprised people positive antibody tests, confirmed exposures, suspicious deaths. people first group aren’t sick right now, people second group hypothetically sick, simply aren’t enough suspicious deaths make number they’re reporting. no, “cases” according NYC. depends mutate. virus stays population like flu, often. somehow people smart enough get vaccinated keep virus freely mutating population mutate much. 

So basically yearly thing. look eyes someone possessed grief scold wanting bury loved ones one gonna congratulate fiscal responsibility. That's things are. people care loved ones enough deem worthy burying remembered time, everyone puts thought finance side it, either they're blindsided death emotional reason. really plan die time. still open 16-49 year olds. Lots people eligible yet obviously still getting shot anyways, point California per capita basis delivering many shots Arizona despite wide open everyone Arizona is.

""As long LA SF proper"", lmao okay, two largest population centers state. easy get shot peninsula south bay either. okay.

 dont see relevance comment.  Hmm...so I’m moving top infection state another top infection state. Sigh vaccines country talking about?

In trials, Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J vaccines significantly reduce risk severe disease, even among infected people. heard anything later would change that.

Personally, I'd recommend Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J choice either time, due supply shortages picky. difference worth waiting. one else wants sister, bf, mom said won’t get vaccine

That sucks.

I went mild hell past 36 hours coping flu-like symptoms J&amp;J vaccine. gonna totally worth it.

I'm sure one's Covid vaccine status would required knowledge emergency medical care. report argues wont though. vaccines protect infection, progression mild severe desease. 500 less hospitalized everyone vaccinated Also well connected people get shots too. hospitals friends family shot times roll get shot. Exactly keep saying variants really x factor Hear words... “went hospital”. nothing riding case COVID home. Again, still get sick. Like QUITE sick. vaccine helps people avoid dying until, well, variants possibly make vaccine less effective. That’s concern. Yes vaccine first round infection provides PROTECTION isn’t magic bullet people rejoin crowds.

Amazing forsee everything without knowing impact many variants people socially distancing anymore etc. like positivity like next person assuming alot even experts saying.  80% teachers back work? Doubtful... true. Poland example well first wave, closed schools immediately worked - fucked later. don’t know anyone gone movie eaten indoors year California. Many people aren’t friends/family indoors. people haven’t socialized another person outdoors year, even. Schools remote, almost jobs remote are. It’s slowly reopened low capacity areas, people still much cautious. many people symptomatic fully vaccinated. Lots people symptomatic vaccinated. people end hospital severe complications vaccinated. Way higher percentage residents San Francisco, San Mateo, Contra Costa, &amp; Bay area Counties 1/both doses compared LA Fresno Counties: anything Bay area getting many doses compared rest state. couple months, whatever say. similar far right leader. Poland Czekia. good argument then. Stop posting thing. I'm sure downvoted, see information vaccine tracker/dashboard app use. Foxnews &amp; Newscorp requiring vaccines kids attend school like done years? Lk literally know link not. studied enough say one way another. number blood clot cases may exactly would happen anyway.

They can't ""admit link"" know whether one. help science would throwing random statements wall. would cause potentially needless panic, already caused previous official jumping gun.

They can't ""admit link"" reason can't admit there's link drinking water getting blood clot. enough evidence say link. give sermon blaming others, jesus, ones addictions bad habits.

I'm really curious many people listen sermon really lightbulb moment ""hey yeah, guy's onto something! "" 

The sermons sat never taught something already know We've eradicated two viruses history, one affected humans. Scientists think possible eradicate viruses non-human reservoirs virus always jump reservoir back human population; covid known least 6 non-human reservoir species. 

There viruses covid dangerous better candidates eradication. SARS-CoV-2 circulating longer us alive. It’s conspiracy theory Johnson Johnson sold baby powder asbestos it. conspiracy theory would saying mob killed JFK. many different ways virus get island borders closed?

Of course island makes huge difference.

People barely wanted live restrictions last year. think go tell restrictions may continue indefinitely?

You live fairy tale world, real world. reason worry cancer vaccines. 

As far aware contraindications previous drug use. believe eligible approved vaccines. already show ID enter many places, including bars. different. fact can't comprehend baffling.

This Gestapo checkpoint, basic public health safety. Sorry double comment, got interrupted hit send finishing thought. 

Anyway, there’s sense arguing this. vaccine passports become normalized, come back thread 10 years, find comment, message saying “you right, fool thinking government would give control”. bit actually, thank you. seriously, I'm glad fared well bout covid.

I also say, moderate anxiety centered around illness, covid freaks fuck begin with. words, I'm heavily biased. 

Ultimately acceptable risk levels, different everyone. Thankfully wife helps balance bit. we'll still protect kids best can.

Best luck you!! Lab tests seemed suggest greater decrease Moderna weren’t tests real world samples rather genetically engineered equivalents variant question comes international travel happen either private company fill gap left government issuing proof vaccination (this option would put lot personal data risk) Americans difficult time traveling abroad, may care that, lot people do. become problem virus continues spread among unvaccinated eventually mutates something renders current vaccines ineffective. get re-live March/April 2020 wait another vaccine developed. focused banning app used prove vaccinated bypass certain COVID screenings. 

Should accept proof been, no. ban app option want also extreme. Gov fighting mandatory aspect outright banning things doesn’t like. 

The issues app potential data storage leaks claims have, say one word accountability. whole different issue wanting digital app keep logs COVID status know plenty Republicans Democrats phenomenal people. Maybe go outside touch grass? going end Lupus isnt it? fact can't see difference enforcement admitted school, sending everyone certain checkpoint, asking passports walk restaurant baffling. Chills fairly unusual cold. could flu flu super low year. I'd get tested covid. southern cali also coming crippling 3rd wave. states period low cases things got really bad. That's fair. easy end mask mandate people acclimated normalcy health department sees huge increase dropping restrictions. hours between? half dozen companies farther along are, incentive spend R&amp;D goes dramatically.  ***at least*** 6 months 

That’s we’ve able study far, tbh. Considering “decay” rate low (still around 90% effective 6 months), theoretically, could last quite bit longer. vaccine documentation totally thing past 

There difference needed vaccine visit another country needing vaccine enter supermarket pub. That's fine. choose comply incredibly simple task, accept consequences. promoting government forcing dangerous individuals businesses

The government *forcing* ""dangerous*"" individuals businesses.

\* actually dangerous. Potentially dangerous. Covid big deal, today nothing burger. Hospitals aren’t run. haven’t nearly year. Nah. Tourist destinations fight lax welcoming, economies brink bankruptcy without tourism money. No, live here. Direct empirical data. Republicans trash humans. really, really did. idea destroyed emotionally got first vaccine. fell apart. that's rebuilding best-- tear down, build strong foundation! April 15th. counties, eligible now. Novavax doesn’t use adenovirus....it’s vaccine that’s uses viral vector technology. It’s adjuvanted protein subunit vaccine...

And said another comment Pfizer also working E484K targeting booster They’re working reading comprehension vaccine. 50s. work outside home. I'm glad may able get then. 30 days last group eligible enough. 

Why propose 60? Wearing mask substitute social distancing. Unless going avoid family friends four months year probably still get flu occasionally. Except travel abroad come back without test, long fully vaccinated. announced days ago. literally story here, lol. spots others convention center, guess. sure it, I'm going guess bars it'll hard enforce.

This goes ways, complain vaccine requirement right? Sure, technically, many times past governor cerulean tinted state ever actually gone far put hard end date mask mandates? twelve twenty! Okay CA push date April 9 please. sound like popular guy. overall tone demeanor, coupled irrational fear unknown snotty know attitude must make life party. False. part initial launch, participating New Yorkers may choose use Excelsior Pass verify COVID-19 vaccination negative test results **as needed gain entry major stadiums arenas, wedding receptions, catered events social gathering limit**.

Venues wish exceed state's gathering limit must use system. Thus said four months go. 

Because can’t accept merits. I’ve fight like three days running, I’m bored. always works version “well, freedom.” isn’t merit, cop out. It’s trying distill everything B. isn’t binary. making basic argument, Hobbes would pleased, you’re setting conditions actual anarchy. shit societal glue level stuff here. boil argument far go comes this: freedom becomes threat freedom. everyone free create risk desire, inevitably someone counter act risk. 

Or rules stuff people comply occasionally don’t kill people accident. Unless Novavax bring us effective booster without Adenovirus 5 vector factor, may dead water. 

We highly unlikely purchase Moderna booster we’re happy Pfizer is, point - target B1.135 booster, accurate results would country dominant strain. Granted may hopeless, equally, may great. 

The makes sense me, may stand alone. shot nothing flu whatsoever Nope, HIPAA violation. law prevents third parties releasing medical information without consent. forbid people/entities asking divulge status.

Also, vaccinations considered public health, state able run vaccine program likely record vaccinated. many vaccinated time around shopping loicens site great! I've family go seamless. see openings, try back next day 9am. it'll tight weeks easier! keep trying. NJ, they're biggest issue right now. Thankfully they'll qualify next week, deserve to. We're bit mess time being!  promoting government forcing dangerous individuals businesses whether businesses want dangerous individuals not. you’re bitching something hasn’t even actually happened yet? chances cold covid? I’m experiencing chills headache, still taste smell Remove bit wanting go party whole paragraph describes U.S. evening news literally every day since least 1995. think people enjoy pessimistic this. shut mouth said honestly, isn’t variants something else. doesn’t seem rational point.

I taken virus seriously year, effing done. removing capacity restrictions, basically acknowledging covid risk minimal. Ha! Florida bitches! Flu coronavirus completely different kinds viruses. Immunity one give immunity other. it'd temporary exactly like mass pandemics happen every year valid comparison point. That's asinine say ""never needed before"" talking something that's basically never happened before, first vaccine we've ever active pandemic. Tell me, could happened before? 

If position think coronavirus serious real hoax something say thinking big deal obviously changes conversation bit. Sorry. Didn’t realize speaking wet paper bag incapable actually putting dots together “rambling” actually relation dumbass comment. forgot ignorant people become. yes CA highest vaccine acceptance rate country. 90+%.

Feel like I’m side hope it’s good here. pandemic isn’t over? Lol communist? let something they’re comfortable doing. body, choice, amirite Imagine bitching using vaccine passports enter places increased risk transmission global pandemic

No, I'm bitching used **after pandemic**. majority vaccinated need them.  wizmaxman believe mean doses. posted 3 hrs ago breakdown. Viruses adjust structures become contagious less deadly. current strains note deadly even equally deadly, though take someone weakened immune system. survive without hosts--they evolve wreak havoc upper respiratory system spread new hosts via coughing sneezing. Well they're still likely going need Americans want travel anywhere outside US. Got see Arsenal beat West Brom years ago. trip Emirates definitely worth disagree politically therefore they’re cesspool humans aren’t lot details exactly Gov. Newsom means, think he’s under-promising hoping over-deliver here. There’s *no way* makes announcement without near-absolute certainty we’d able achieve it, there’s reason believe can.

Cases, hospitalizations, deaths lowest levels they’ve since October. Vaccinations ramping we’ll rolling April 15th. everything continues go plan, according benchmarks Newsom set, won’t surprised re-open sooner less restrictions.

As Californian-- someone *really* misses able stuff friends-- really great, hopeful news. ultimate day really look forward to, it’s certainly within reach. Yes, case Sputnik, difference dose one two type viral vector (to make sure immunity targeting vector get spike protein code cells). always push back. They're really big fans that. Imagine bitching using vaccine passports enter places increased risk transmission global pandemic don’t want people know whether you’ve stuck needle recently.  largely true. We're truly insane national major housing bubble though math getting much worse many places (including far exurbs rural regions) except maybe prairie provinces (though bubble seems reaching finally too). Quick question: first second doses biologically? I’ve heard second dose hurts wondering it’s different substance body already used it. Thank you! J&amp;J. I'm past full body aches, headache, lethargy, nausea still go away Odds variant sends us back square one incredibly low. can, HIPAA violation. HIPAA prevents third parties (your doctor, hospital, insurance company, etc.) releasing medical information without express consent. prevent others asking medical status. certainly required answer, protections choose to. diminution terms neutralizing titers, amount observed Moderna’s vaccine. It’s necessary would likely improve protection B1.135 E484K carrying variants, they’re working it. AP Bio new covid variant learn every week immuonology Thank link. take one every months headache, works times.

For original question, thinking 10s millions people taking new vaccine enough feel safe taking it.

But see, investigate blood clots regarding AZ still mind taking it, I'd glad girlfriend would rather get Pfizer. place export vaccines ever reach US numbers. everyone sub start feeling second dose side effects? Got second Pfizer shot 11:30 EST yesterday far feel arm soreness. I’m worried symptoms gonna creep hit like truck nowhere haha Sweden zero deaths reported April 2 6. Yes! kids daycare years back constant colds/flus/stomach bugs. particularly bad run staff disinfect toys end day made HUGE difference. Kids notoriously bad fomite spread, certainly know gross adults too. Yeah, everybody sort got last year corona first hit. nutters got going ended dumbass conspiracies here. real shame anti-maskers anti-vaxxers caught died honestly *regulating intensifies* haven’t telling people get n95 masks now? unfortunate tell people take precautions really. hear article saying wore 3 masks think get one n95 dude.

I would could find one. Oh nooooo... Sinclair.... Owner local news misinformation! There's another one like owns ton local newspapers. Chemtrails get real using MIT technology Yes it’s card faked vaccination cards caused least one outbreak yellow fever. [fake cards led yellow fever outbreak disagree. Wearing masks sucks - it’s uncomfortable, especially working labor job. removes sense human connection communication. winter nice helped keep face warm summer makes face hot hell. Exercising mask uncomfortable too.

Even hardline people I’ve met, think we’ll wearing masks years come, agree wearing masks suck. They’re necessary pandemic, they’re completely unnecessary normal life, fast approaching latter. People don’t *want* wear masks. Many realize it’s right thing do. Even realize it’s law. nobody wants wear masks don’t to.

When start seeing hospitalizations deaths bottom out, 60% majority vaccinated, you’ll hard pressed find people willing wear masks. Indiana already dropped mask mandate - conservative states soon follow suit, July liberal states well. winter, guarantee places masks still required hospitals (mostly normal use), nursing homes, hospice. prefer news lunch whatever time Maddow on. fault contract tracers course. Contact tracing ""early spread"" strategy. already everywhere, useless. imagine future hearing someone slipping vaccine anti vaxxers cocktail? sources zero credibility news name carried cable tv providers put news category... That's pick number recognize.

We really need better telecom laws/enforcement. Taking plane large audience meeting always unsafe, you’re aware now. study East Asian cultures. cultures, people get social brownie points wise. smart empathetic qualities respected. Tucker carlson defense thing.... Hey judge... said crazy reasonable person would take seriously zero liability frome. Thank explaining this. someone reads article title, impression 1 every 3  people infected COVID develop neurological disorder. numbers need context

Who needs context fear monger. try 32%

No state hit 50% yet doubt AZ first. Try New Mexico Connecticut maybe weeks. forget direct injection lunacy via Facebook *et al*. study done stadiums 5000 fans. distancing stadiums spreading people out. still local spikes. Yes is. America leads, without doubt. habit rest World got back America truly Great.  Wait see people country (Brazil). People share stupid shit 5 minutes Google could shown fake interesting idea. thinking pandemic could exhibit kind critical mass behavior: many people infected one time, would high aerosol concentrations enclosed spaces like shops leading chain reaction explosive growth cases. But, know realistic is. *33.62%  scream every chance get. hardly ever scream out, certainly ""feel superior"". Stop clichés.

""Holy generalization Batman! ""Christ"" Christianity lot deeper lmao. Mormons reject large amount foundational beliefs Jesus Christianity preaches. Can't claim Christian share foundational beliefs.

Is OK shit belief climate change happen? vaccines makes children autistic? course is. OK believe anything. isn't. 

And comes important part: error they, seems, making think fundamental difference mainstream religions made stuff. somehow deserving respect faith millions believe you, faith old well established part culture live in. truly think religious faith deserve respect, superstition also deserve respect.

lol wearing chins Im anti vaxers, find bit self solving situation within 6 feet person 15 cumulative minutes CDC would say yes, also take account guidance whether outdoors person masked maybe somewhat 15 minutes wouldn't. Though within 6 feet lot longer definitely. Easily 100 million. Lol folks overdramatic. No...schools kids scan vaccine passport everyday...

No, scan vaccine passport get admitted school. different? fact app 100% storing data, blind data/privacy breaches recent years?

Oh no! chinese bot knows got vaccine!!! No, I'm type person that's aware feds already vaccine records google already tracks matter ""secure"" make phone. robots come Stay inside then, doubt anyone miss indeed way around limitation, even cards used it'd deterrent Get vaccinated. you’re good. need prove vaccination status? Make sure vaccinations available anyone wants long enough time. Then, people choose get vaccinated, that’s them. isn’t “wear mask protect others situation”. get vaccinated, done do. Worry yourself. want one Razor making. cyberpunk thing ever seen. “just hang there” mentality frustrating, I’ve heard months.

I remember listening Trudeau press conference April said, “All need get next three months April - that’s ask”. frustrated, told - held 3 months. get return? Another lockdown, voice pleading “just hold on, little longer”. 

I can’t hold longer - need cold hard dates pushed back, else can’t comply. need Canadian leaders - like California, like Britain - set hard dates life resume, even it’s stages. 

I.e., *Just Hold on* April 30th, allow indoor gatherings 10, businesses resume 30%.

*Just Hold On* June 1st, start resuming sports leagues, going dinner friends meeting happy hour colleagues 

*Just Hold On* October 31st, restrictions removed life back. Pretty ironic guy claims ""pro-life."" simple, don't. move droves, vote exact thing made California California land baby fit much vaccine! government incentivize WFH since reduces carbon emissions. I've putting maybe 600 miles month car since covid started, normally put 1000-1500 month it. reason say ""track more!"" 

having piece paper showing got vaccine ""tracking more"" that's already public information perhaps, big problem one two business it. big problem amounts systemic discrimination.

The bigger concern people supportive push wide spread vaccine passport likely supportive government making mandatory use passport everywhere business making mandatory falls within overton window. Pure case counts mean nothing without looking testing. 

[Test rate Florida around 9.4% right 10.2%. Connecticut 4.4%. Delaware 5.8%. Mass 2.5%. NH 5.4%. Vermont 2.1%. Minnesota 6.7%. one states worse Florida state mix federal sites generous eligibility (teachers etc) state sites less generous eligibility (age 65+ certain limited health care workers). existed together roughly month Monday sites eligibility.

Really think dual approach would best overall. Prioritize risk group state level appointments limits distribution. Offer generous eligibility federal sites mix appointments walk anyone last two hours day etc. literal weeks state empty lines appointments begging people find senior get vaccinated. Meanwhile rest state wait vaccines went unused small businesses kept hurting. Maybe perfect solution, state definitely dragged another month without reason overly strict eligibility rules. Yeah wasn’t sure since it’s COVID variant saying desire unvaccinated take priority people want go back normal worry anymore. That's right. Lmao misleading title CNN

The observed problems psychological, people reporting anxiety, PTSD, etc. In-fact ruled elevated risk actual neurological disease like Parkinson’s. 

Just another terrible headline CNN There's difference school requiring vaccination government requiring vaccine passport. shockingly better medical workers.

As teacher, know getting proper PPE work unvaccinated months. Glad see fellow teachers protecting themselves. Virus says No? constitutions western countries simply forbid discriminate people medical history. would dangerous precedent, possibly slippery slope fashist future.

You mean like children going public school U.S. must show proof vaccination order enroll? that's case since 1850s? dangerous precedent? could choice 1 2 chose 1.

Recent studies shown possible very, unlikely. CDC still saying there’s possibility, do. Uhhh...no, even remotely true Canadians disagree agree he's saying? public prefer slower equitable roll vs US approach? eligible “having access” doesn’t mean able get appointment

It take 3-4 weeks get appointment plus 6 weeks full vaccine course. That’s people even able schedule now. Many states face serious supply constraints appointments available weeks open much country, really everywhere precautions like masks. We've open since August five days per week Florida. think soon masks schools like county right next mine started today. Plenty parents feel safe sending kids back without them. It’s toss up. got wait call backs. 

If know anyone intel that’s giving referrals said hi lol

Edit: free today's Executive Order appears narrowly tailored refer (1) COVID vaccines (2) Emergency Use Authorization.

once vaccine gets FDA approval -- Pfizer may get end May 1 -- Gov. Abbott's XO would apply. Pfizer probably also well along w.r.t. clinical trials prove children safely take vaccine too. think quite school districts Texas require students show proof COVID vaccine enroll fall Seriously doubt it. Biologically age physical maturity adults anyway. There's many remote positions available. Everyone able find remote job they're looking for, unfortunately.

Us office workers going trudge hate it, long we'll forget nice life year Fortunately, us work job make friends. work job make money.

I home, thanks. normal universities (and elementary schools, middle schools, high schools) require vaccinations. 

This nothing new, news, except people want outraged everything.  Yes, believe talking ability job, shit-post reddit... No, many people unaware sorts things available them. Discounted gym memberships don’t exactly fall ‘cushy’ category benefits anyways... company forced us back June despite remote capable pandemic due “decrease productivity”. decrease actually due everyone’s hours cut 20%. hemorrhaging employees since then. 
My department actually increased productivity home able trim fat firing one employee working all. mentioned HR told I’d let one department everyone want to. It’s stupid antiquated mind set that’s probably going death company. 1br apartment right wfh (no dedicated office space) wife working room who's calls day.

Basically same. wife working side side dining room table last year. 

I'm attorney, industry full bunch older generations still big face time office, we're never going full WFH. ideal still going office 3 days week working home 2 days. either case, intend home put daughter bed every day, even work goes sleep. Would like double cheeseburger that? Thanks clarification. Knew gotten aspect backwards. fine! Congratulations getting vaccinated :) think people also realize lack social interaction business decision - wife can't really go eat go movies anything right either. mean can, wearing masks half seats empty feels little weird.

Once covid restrictions gone, full remote bad. time ever go real friends family, need use coworkers tolerate social interaction 5/2 obviously sufficient enough keep Reddit 😬 not, started remote never want go office Also people small children around house constantly want attention working home.

I love kid much, Im absolutely productive could office. aint email, never asked. We're talking UK banks though... regional bank UK Cambridge &amp; Counties offer service recently complain playing video games living? Honestly, though, much brainpower take realize little kind middle manager actually does? corporations run investors care gets done long stock goes up, acquisition whatever nets profit? STILL widespread problem, well two decades age Internet? could also live savings year like hungry sleeping rain. kidding. Granted, back first gen (my recollection least), tons “Could process, image unclear, please try again” messages less ideal. think it’s real easy. Same.

I've essentially WFH 2 years. whole time pandemic manager all, ""Well, need office often. things can't get accomplished WFH person""

I handle hardware, sales, physical assets office need committed to. work done VPN remote connections, even office.

Turns out, salty said, ""There nothing can't home, here""

Enter covid...  turns out, fucking right. dream going back finish ME, whole ""can't engineering courses online time middle 9-5 workday"" BS kept almost decade, now.

So boss saying developing class system adjusted vaccination rate males females, clotting + low platelets syndrome incidence sexes. important understand mechanism asses depends upon viral vector spike protein... J&amp;J vaccine scrutiny now... Yep, took picture phone put firebox important documents. uhh, no, went public school last 50+ years, provide evidence vaccination. Requiring COVID vaccine would different

Somewhat different COVID-19 vaccines completely FDA approved... I’ve Canada MANY times work. There’s honestly nothing would want couldn’t States.

To own, though. “best” one one get first. agree.

My situation bit unique - work what's basically satellite office rest team works different office, sense I've always worked remote.

That said whole company went remote required daily check-ins managers stuff, getting ton face time. Prior spoke manager every 1-2 weeks, generally 'everyrhing going fine? Yeah? Alright I'll give back time then' type deal 5 days office shit. 6 months 5 days home - turns shit too. keep 2 home office days week. perfect

on hand hated traveling much, always move change jobs. wife travels 20 min 1 tram, go foot 10 min work. actually work white collar I’m small business owner don’t offer benefits. Womp womp I’ve work home last five years 2 companies I’ve received offers 50% higher receiving would work office space 5 days week. I’m much happier working home let teams wfh want to. Things get done time, people online office hours, clients happy... office culture 40 hour work week bullshit find people end stretching tasks kill time. get work done &lt; 25 hours week “on call” emergencies really spend time family playing dog. commute literally five minutes way. Even obnoxious waste. I’ve heard discussions, however, public universities need wait full FDA approval vaccine, opposed emergency approval. makes sense ways. You’re fine. shit? International students need show proof vaccinations get student visa make classrooms safe space (along course every one would go live). logic applies ""passport vaccines"". Anyone travelled extensively knows ""passport vaccines"" always existed - called ""proof vaccinations"" experience seems like people want go back ones definitely seem marriage problems home even pandemic. staying small apartments (the single ones least) moved back home saved rent/utilities. Personally least I'd take working small apartment (but able work coffee shops/co-working areas) going back office. surprised see companies like Wework revitalised corporates paying flexible space office workers occasionally come meetings. full time there? 40 hours per week?  no, get vaccinations public school. way many, many, many decades. feel missing point. 

The fact seems 'large swath' students want learn fundamental problem members teaching profession addressing.

The pandemic would barely barrier learning children wanted learn. 

Having taught professionally understand challenges involved. understand apparent institutional unwillingness even acknowledge problem. job pandemic can't WFM know come back department going push 4 day work week. Maybe guys communist China shoot protesters ban free speech. Problem solved? think corporations would though certainly make harder unionize.  Yes I'm damn serious it. ain't convince loose two hours time day well heard earned money transport something literally better house better equipment.

You want exchange air particles? pay transport well commuting time. I've told requiring vaccination form big brother nazi totalitarianism. 

I see it, lots do, reason. we're I'll go ahead thank trump half million dead people sat twitter Woah woah variants .001% deadly. Think children!!!! risk COVID-19 complications rises rapidly age, tiny risk rare blood clot pales insignificance benefits vaccinated.

But people 30 risks COVID also low, trade-off strong (but still get vaccinated). Hello Washington. Many schools reopening. Indoor dining closed November February something. Seattle restaurants still takeout. bar seating allowed establishment. Bars serve food remain closed. Buffets illegal. Alcohol sales end midnight. Movie theaters closed since last March aside 3 week period October reopened 25% February. Still capped 50%. anything see right (4 movies currently playing nearby 14 screen theater, give idea). indoor spaces, permitted open all, capped 50%. Currently talk rolling back 25%. Universal mask mandate. Numerous outdoor festivals already cancelled summer. I've extroverts moaning can't wait get back office coz they're crawling walls home. 

Great, sorry suffer couple years, welcome I've felt adult life working open plan offices. quarantine? let right in? travel family? canadian living US also would love go help mom canada couple weeks. bank regional offered atleast 8 years. 9 10 Post??? Baby we’re still pandemic.  fair think amtrak little different subway cheap city bus. costs enough scum upper class want see likely there. 480 dollars?? significant difference eligibility expect done. example, Texas eligibility fully open week now, given 45% willing adults, assuming 85% adults want vaccine, least one dose. 85% wants vaccine, even half way point. pretty sure vaccinate lot quickly, eligibility completely open, mean close done.

The Netherlands, example, even open eligibility end June, invite everyone one one via mail per age, risk priority group old young. eligibility never opened basically fully done. expect 85% adult population vaccinated least one dose end Q2. 

But comparing Netherlands open full eligibility end June cannot compared Texas opened last week. following different strategies, talking different things (actually done vaccinating vs. fully open eligibility). goes Germany, probably.

Oh, trying say one better one quicker other. know US ahead terms vaccinations. 17 year old accidentally given moderna. bad?  started new job remotely, came job WFH lot already (and first 8 months pandemic, 100%)

Yes, would like meet team point, little harder getting onboarded without real interaction. know team theres reason go week two mRNA carrier technology developed almost 20 years primarily purpose cancer therapy. That's able develop mRNA Covid vaccine rapidly.

So far, funding mRNA research limited. Hopefully, revenues Covid vaccines help companies worked mRNA boost work mRNA cancer therapy. understanding fine either way. UK spacing two doses 12 weeks, believe.  got tetanus shot Apr 2 rusty nail pierced skin.....I slated vaccine April 14, twelve days later. Everything see says avoid vaccine two weeks prior although seem though studied. reddit say? wait EU approval? That's good point. hope issues AZ erode public's confidence vaccines. 

This point developing multiple different vaccines, all. Yup. first Pfizer dose armpit wasn’t visible swollen felt like balloon there. Made hard sleep. 

Hoping arm pain feel round 2 Sunday I’m expecting worst. people 30 Use would lose extra week's vacation, days instead getting another weeks vacation 2 years 5 years.  country matters. “Bolsonaro fucked Brazil’s covid response, want now? Go back time?”

See play game too. want problem fixed politicians held accountable mistakes. Next man/woman up. u.s hoarding vaccines want vaccinate occupying forces world them. disagree. I'm individual contributor engineer. need ""pressure"" comes office. hate working remotely people name instant messaging system... impossible build relationships difficult learn others. even get started access hand analysis componets. Eh it’s mostly work place. 

Some managers handle remote employees work doesn’t skip beat. 

Some managers completely fucking helpless can’t bug every 30 seconds updates companies huge problems. I'm currently working hybrid schedule perfect me. two days get socialization work handle anything needs done person. spend rest week working home alone cats, music blast, bathroom, kitchen, commute. Even though want pandemic end ASAP, I’m youth sports time. activities happen around youth sports taking group photos games masks, sports masks could worn not, etc. Open mouth eaters enrage like nothing else. Shared office one every time ate wanted dead. Earbuds thing worked. I’m per well-established, whole host new colleagues start last twelve months… small handful done did, honestly really appreciate too! It’s really great get sense people I’m working actually like identical situation, left work last February looking somewhere closer, freaked lived savings June got fantastic job 10 minutes away home paying London job saving £4000+ year lost trains.

 


I'm looking buy first home Missus next couple months, incredible feeling. Words violence, I’m told. 

Not fists weapons violence. right. one fever episode broke virtually symptoms stopped. Like someone threw switch. lower back still sore bit headache left, especially look down, feel lot better. say Tylenol didn’t much already take Celebrex daily arthritis Ibuprofen no. bizarre painful day. hope over....whew....I’m starving pooped. keeps trying counter ""what going see class system develop people come office seen committed get recognized promoted often it.""

My workplace said pre-pandemic, mysteriously, half promotions permanent telecommuters. tried yoga park thing moms Covid. youngest basically treated jungle gym whole time. got electric cargo bike, looking forward putting little two back going bike rides 6 year old summer! hell terrible here?

There many countries tried much stricter lockdowns yet still find worse situation find despite spent time without lockdowns speak minute tried “locking down” everybody started bitching it. 

We far better countries thing failing ramping vaccination; sucks everybody responsible ashamed of. No, choice come different day they're giving one vaccines. Commuting work waste time money job year pandemic proved home. 

Not maintain huge office complexes good companies too

But what’s good employees power. Corporate America designed keep shackled it. That’s want think ‘benefits’ great.

3. Eat healthy. Find food that’s healthy love, eat it. Reduce salt consumption, too! 
4. Don’t drink much alcohol. Alcohol causes lots health harms.
5. Control blood pressure. That’s number 1 killer, Americans high blood pressure don’t control.
6. clinician see regularly. Check cholesterol blood sugar, get screened cancer.
7. Watch out! Drive carefully. Take steps avoid falls. Avoid dangerous drugs, take medications directed. Remember, opiate painkillers relieve short turn cause long term pain, kill you. need palliation, lots better way manage pain.

Problem cant give money many piss away instead paying debt. felt need reply really like subject. someone hybrid thing while, get witness disconnect peoples' (sometimes ridiculous) assumptions reality am.

I've gotten people put foot mouth first meet person assumed black (I live midwest, mostly goofballs racists). I've flirted coworkers heard voice, that's nice compliment, meet find I'm skinny nerd flirting stops. way around happened, too!

I'm training people provide great service clients. clients meet receiving service find presumptions shattered pieces, maybe it'll motivate drop presumptions future!  JnJ ultra conservative headwinds year. work one suppliers manufacture promised US EU  

and extra family time great. pets love us working home personal metric would herd immunity via vaccine + prior infections, really close it. Realistically sometime May June, far off. point, combined widespread vaccine availability, still gotten vaccine that's reason places can't open begin operate normally. California reopening June 15th reasons afaik. meet people lunch get socialization aspect? 

I agree every situation career field same. think hybrid situation like one day work week may work. However, also think would hold back lot people wish travel different sort lifestyle.

 manager employer. point work making friends. business wants hire people who's first priority socializing. okay people handle responsibly quite frankly not. manager typically happens petty drama different workplace cliches form others get left out. Others get frustrated feel coworkers pulling weight see standing around chit chatting clock. drag supervisors managers middle mediate. help little. type job work? worked factory, could still worked? 

I office job. Yet. buy rare used pill AstraZeneca whereas Pfizer sells suspicious number identical pills no-name Chinese factories?

I think you’d surprised compared two nowadays, Amazon marketplace complete hole. failing see point. *stopping* 18-30 taking jab. However, *if* alternative available they'll give instead. Many 18-30's still offered AZ, they'll right refuse *as do* would rather take *tiny* risks. extra hour sleep amazing. Plus I’m way productive WFH days stuff around house lunch.  Guidance restrictions two different things. I'm glad live society make choices. Taking away abundance caution certainly impacts quality life. Also scientific vaccine data currently support idea vaccinated people could live normal life significantly risk others. Finally good luck getting support vaccinated message things wont change. group productive much higher moral prior returning office. 


The reason we're back director keep thumb us. much micro management lol. Wow. Looks like they’re censoring people talking restriction vaccine data posts. They’ve removed bunch comments people saying bad move. going mod team? ask USA’s response covid diverged strikingly pandemic preparedness plans place advance? didn’t plans recommend long term society-wide lockdowns? pursue suck strategy previously table? Thanks time! Enjoy following Twitter. Weird saying day I'd guestimate 30% work force wont return office stay working home one significant long term effects covid.  that's statistically significant correlation, based data ema head any, oh ""clear"" link Grrrr. Fear mongering.

Number confirmed infections children - 4M (actual number likely WAY higher). Number confirmed mis-c cases due covid - less 3000.

We talking less .1% MOST. sad articles, nytimes less, able make simple statements describe order magnitude rare is. yup they're showing interviews. apply check box continue get free money. I've never life seen many ""now hiring"" signs. friends manage hotels cant find anyone work this. one 15 interviews set one showed. one showed came interview sweat pants, slippers reeked weed. Yep, people team complained feels like always work now. issue though, stop time log work system that's it, I'm done. someone messages pings phone reply done day, logged off, I'll check/get back next day. Hit nail head hard probably 3 inches deep wood. 

I always stunned americans setting bar low compete countries like China Russia terms ""freedom"" never Western European countries maybe Australia terms arguably important metric ""human development"", ""freedom"" doubt important part, limited view lot Americans typically view it. I'm similar situation think world returns ""normal"" non-work related social interactions make go away. going crazy toxic office area, going back make feel better gotta tell you, either way way folks keep continually bringing social justice protests justification sporting events feels sort gross. it’s pandemic emergency. haven’t health emergency like don’t think EUA bean excuse require vaccine. Exactly way feel. never liked mixing work relaxation place. course WFH many benefits (such buying gas much less often), brain wired work work relax home. I'll problem keeping things way before. 79 yo father got astra zeneca invitation 3 days ago RLP, registered since weeks, decline doesn’t know what’s going thrombosis risk right can’t blame him. Maybe he‘ll better luck next time get non-astra invitation. year ago nobody really cared vaccines. probably right, even working home, jobs still dominate lot time. Removing commute reclaims five hours week, there's still forty hours week devoted job. going happen still boomers running companies think office work gets done. Oh man, this. house home office, started pandemic working apartment. much better I’ve adapted don’t really mind it. still, miss commute alone time much. really separates things case work, never truly turn off, time separation everything. Good joke. lot people want wear even pandemic. Even even want think pandemic ends Again....this already tried before.

Having someone totaly different timezone, barely speaks english dodgy internet connection ok companies.

Also hybrid solution dosen't work another country... Ouch. True.

(If could play every game like Tampa, though...Wow, would completely different situation standings-wise) downvoted saying different personality someone else. We're different. I'm also employer, owner too. I've really come love working home. works lot better expected. Developing software together (peer programming) lot easier (using screen sharing), gamer culture really beneficial knowing social online.

From perspective admit disagree assessment here. experience cooperation works best everyone works home, everyone works office. Team-by-team is. majority work office remaining IMO seem get marginalized. end extras externals. interactions clumsy. everyone work home equal playing field, things get natural again.

Also, another point would like make see good thing western employees. spent huge amount effort build strong local team company. Really long hiring processes, wading huge amount mediocre candidates. work home, global candidates would blow local ones water terms skill costs. see negative pressure wages happen becomes norm.

The adage, careful wish for, comes mind. Ummm already live largest apartment afford. live high cost living area, rent around joke. 

Also talking school. I’m factory worker.  Enough vaccines 1 week double number cases/deaths? That's unlikely I'm part second group. can't productive working home, I've coming office lately. Though, I'd like able stay home things slower, get rest Studies shown vast majority people recover fully lung scarring post-covid symptoms within 6 months recovery. time period? dumb. Comparing one specific country group others? 

Totally meaningless cherry picking specific time periods well they've trials 6 months so... would expect last long least. Blue Jackets distinct advantage even COVID go one games season.

(sorry) OC's post son hospitalized January 15th 2020 Covid. vent 3 1/2 weeks. Total hospital stays 7 1/20 5/20. Still battling First case reported Jan. 26; Gov. Doug Ducey declared national emergency March 13

I'm arguing tested got results January 15th, I'm arguing test would've back-dated January 15th that's admitted. Even backdated, person supposedly hospital COVID 11 days tested? guess person first case Arizona? makes sense. Muslim totally take becomes available age bracket. article fails mention Muslims break fast health reason. vaccine legitimate health reason. Health always priority fasting Islam simple fact UK (for once) actually managed get right politicians giving experts large pile cash telling get it. Ironically political angle UK side managed NHS. We’ve pretty grim winter UK whilst Europe relatively free we’re actually starting get back freedoms, largely part AZ vaccine low cost. Whilst rest Europe sadly struggling go back lockdown, Brits finally start enjoy life again.

Given doesn’t seem affect overwhelmingly vast majority adults it’s right suggest AZ vaccine safe also investigate limited number people suffering ill effects. you’ve ever tried buy even slightly strong medicine seen list side effects ranging nothing instant mega death. Even lot counter shelf medicine can’t mixed kinds daily products they’re still considered safe. Texas Florida experiencing something similar? Could hot weather allowing people outside higher degree natural immunity due letting run loose since last summer?

Edit: somehow read fact already mentioned natural immunity. OP literally responding someone said ""proof vaccination wear mask"" can't see undermine confidence vaccine especially 30s 40s. think full indoor events mid June? sure 2nd pfizer, plan getting another til info antibody longevity done. 100% true brother keeps reminding “people leaving metropolitan areas realize work home”, continual counter arguments:

1. People harder time turning work mode; lot people bring home work, usually different work office.

2. People also relaxed things like breaks drinking job. 

3. Collaboration become harder room.

100%, working home become common seriously doubt become norm. someone else pointed out, phrasing “full-time” important imagine reduction office time common. likely businesses determine needs office, doesn’t need be, split time. sides story.

Started new job remotely too. never met colleagues person. still enjoy work.

I still interact work them. feel seeing person would little value addition.

I think culture organisation team. I've seen dead places pre-pandemic colleagues toxic. pretty good end point metric though. someone tells group experiencing inequality health, live longer, I'm going pretty skeptical. work big bank trying find balance. 

For lot roles need 100% person first 90 days variable location requirement based business need. 

As drift back normal see us creating balance. business lines saw minimal negative impacts seen some. believe plan looking individuals also business lines. 

I moving due commitment worst case I’ll need office couple times month tops. concerts already scheduled Colorado.  obviously NYC subway rush hour... Pretty much imo That's works. Unless take car glanced run kill another person it. age spread it, vaccs shown suppress spread. Correct. hand. started first year college remotely without choice. friends, frat parties, social gatherings, sports, school events. Really bummed Oh yea, definitely, medical billing automatable using machine learning AI , startups trying now. health economics cost-effectiveness side things. even trying disprove there? Notorious youthful rural city Tokyo huge natural advantage obviously. virus cannot mutate evade mRNA vaccines. produce spike protein necessary enter cells. part spike actual key. virus mutated spike point evaded vaccine, could longer enter cells infect people. best, make vaccine slightly less effective. Yeah neither. Idk least outside yeah stupid close proximity. mean say commute 200 miles driving day? going 100 miles hour would still one hour full driving, clearly wouldn’t traffic rush. would guess probably driving almost 2 hours way, every day. Almost 4 hours day tacked onto 8hrs put in.

I’m saying don’t believe you, frankly don’t know would stupid arbitrarily accuse lying here. think it’s fair think it’s *crazy* would put instead considering options (whether it’s new job new home). amount money wasted employees employer making people come office staggering Quarterly planning inceptions happen fine zoom. well ‘meeting days’ dreadful draining.

Eh I'd argue happen fine web calls. may reach end may answers questions, quality output big planning sessions everyone WFH vs quality stuck building together blatantly clear - person answered 10x questions got shit done.

It's incapable online, personal responsibility every participant plummets virtual meetings. overall quality involved drops dramatically.

Also, part point big meetings bit dreadful. keep people moving get shit done one wants day. Compared home people mindlessly bunch things, meeting lengths increasing quality decreasing.

And I'm damn software dev. _loath_ meetings. even admit getting better results forcing us building together.

Actually I'm bloody annoyed pubs *still* open, apparently dealing Covid properly much trouble. Wish lived NZ Australia, pubs open right now! keep taking aspirin, mum took aspirin 1 month covid, stopped becouse doc told her, months later got stroke! something blood thicker average + covid making worse Maintaining big office footprints socialites big expense big companies. opportunity slim footprints thereby save costs. Converting workspaces mobile work spots (I.e. reserve desk plan go office) building creation spaces (places teams get together brainstorm plan big projects etc) way forward imo. need go office day day. team planning, Big project launches, team celebrations see going office. quit first ""real"" job, everyone shrugs wishes well.

I made current friends first job. We'd moved across country new region college.

I'm close enough couple get middle night (and reciprocal), whole group us met couple times year pre-Covid.

I think partly luck. lot phases life people trying make new friends. Even are, need interests common extend time, compatible personalities. Thank answering! quit don’t return least hybrid office work. Productivity died company. Coworkers would previously called “middle performers” seem plummeted most. Top performers still getting things done home bottom performers already bad. Middle performers make bulk companies unfortunately. 

Beyond productivity impacts, matter business, impact mental health without social interaction work enormous. I’ve turned work home jobs going clear back 2012 won’t take one either. looking Walensky said enough yet known whether new virus variants variants, still seeing increased transmissibility. don’t yet know increased morbidity mortality,” said.

Well actually, yes, do. (Reuters) - People Britain received first dose AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine continue offered second dose, despite change guidance administering shot younger citizens, health officials said. “Those received first dose AstraZeneca vaccine continue offered second dose AstraZeneca vaccine, according set schedule,” said Wei Shen Lim, chair Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation. Would get vaccinated turn. mother, important monitor allergy 15-30 minutes vaccine, would go ahead get vaccinated. Launch Nukes. good run Human race. Agreed, choice. would likely office well. Meaning, ideal solution need get social interaction outside work. 

This pretty much negates primary ""go back office"" arguments I've seen. 

People need learn take better ownership satisfying needs socialization, stop letting artificially bolstered forced office interaction. lot managers feel threatened WFH. 

Many people agree micromanagement general overbearance make productive workers. reality significant percentage managers corporate America justify existence showing *their* boss good cracking whip.

WFH calls middle management’s existence question many work places. workers productive, so, without superior peering cubicles, continue pay superior?

WFH proven work pandemic. tell office productivity reasons, outing liar. 

I almost guarantee company calls back it’s employees office suffering severe politicking management. that’s place would continue work at. That’s change jobs every 2-3years. I’ll take $10-15k increase upwards title change meager raise I’d fight tooth nail for. Well yeah, people aren’t sure vaccines last long term, new strains keep popping don’t know whether vaccine prevent them, many dumb fucks don’t want take all. Maybe stuff open closely approximate normal life, masks could around couple years. might suck deal experience exactly. fatigue insane. Took effort get bed. metro north monthly $430 month. test 150 million doses dispose contaminated... somewhere could spend hour googling right time instead hundreds hours obsessing every twist turn large vaccination site right next old stadium. There's lot work going area GISAID SPHERES. We're testing, important recognize genotyping useful also link epidemiological clinical information. lack organization health public health systems country makes harder than, say UK. There's progress, progress needed. know proportion hospitalizations deaths variants, don't. That's kinda average commuting NYC area. I'm guessing similar major metro areas.  UK technically lockdown anymore compared Germany. 12th, things resume semblance normalcy.  crossover one asked I’m school, I’ve online internships. prefer person 100% professional trip, I've working someone tested COVID + 

My first test one week ago negative, I do second test tomorrow. Without *big symptom,* since yesterday feel like 90% well rather 100% well. We'll see tomorrow. 

Now question. I'd like cycle test-lab. almost one week inside need move outside, still feel like could it. Let's say mild covid rather stress. risk make-it-worse exercising ? get you’re coming from, change people get vaccinated. vaccines almost completely prevent symptomatic cases, soon come time majority people, getting Covid largely inconsequential. point, don’t see outbreak really matters, outbreak largely asymptomatic mild cases, probably means less symptoms become permanent due less symptoms existing first place. ""pointless risk"". Currently deem balance favour alternative vaccines incidence covid low UK. rate high winter risk covid far outweighs risks vaccine even 20 odd year olds. risks even factor long covid risk transmitting disease somebody else, risk go ICU Covid South Dakota one worst hit areas US, data shown subway didn’t seed NYC, NYC’s winter wave bad rest country. NYC much likely got hit hard early didn’t know mitigation measures worked secretly spreading weeks without mitigation. Yeah absolutely understand point view. definitely pleasant hearing news related AZ. However, since already got first shot (before situation AZ became hectic), might well get second dose also AZ. mood experimenting different brands second shot. giving much freedom people vaccines might beneficial might result mass vaccination, still comes AZ specifically, given right choose. putting us uncomfortable position us got first dose already want take AZ. Ya... I'd quit stay home 100% post pandemic. office space kitchen table, whilst husband works tiny den windows. home feels like prison. office went fully remote started working l. median age probably 55...maybe 60. Basically old. giant rod butts coming full time. 1 department came back like 4 months state mandate. 
It's depressing me. work much better home, less people dragging away I'm doing. Also, worker, HATE people want deskside support remote machines. 
Get. With. It. They're pushing hard may 1 full time office I'm like NNOOOOOOoooooo 
I bet boss stays remote makes us come in, like remote let come whenever want. force arbitrary reason... Shit, filling applications whole time log to?? Gas $4 gallon. City Parking expensive breaks matter though, long output remains constant. 

That flexibility people love desire keep. Sure, days work late open email Saturday. completely counteracted many days sign 130 last meeting ends. 

So really self control issue. same... live state income tax, office state income tax. working home, longer pay income tax, basically 10% pay

Long covid serious thing, people respond discussions crazy. like say wrong questions! people wondering, may failed explain well.

I wonder question: over. Well, pandemic everywhere, that's long way away. get new normal fall. safer next months, less illness death be. damn cubes, man. cubes 6 feet apart make sure one cube next you. ...Id rather sit home be- uh sorry, 'office workspace' Zoom blurred background.

She works desk job working home year loves it. boss starting indicate bringing people back office full time soon possible, dreading it. much fully vaccinated last Friday, yet tell anyone office. 

I've working *out* house year well I'm dreading too. job entails lot driving locally, able bring work truck home need stop office couple times week pick supplies. I'm also fully vaccinated now, boss knows (because want come back office full time either). I've told boss repeatedly get work done way office every morning 7:30 sitting around 9 (we're supposed impede traffic 9, effectively job starts 9am). 

In case, surprised starts looking hard jobs boss says come back. me, surprised boss tries drag working home/out home long possible. 

I'm really hoping boss implements hybrid approach I'm hoping mine able swing us still working houses taking trucks home. 

If pandemic shown full time workers anything, lot jobs done remotely offices unnecessary expense. think companies would see advantage easy way cut costs without cutting workforces. told last month risk death due AZ vaccine. Whitty literally told everyone live TV. able now, might case employer agrees working full time home. companies deploy tracking software tracks idle time view screen given moment. worked home long time companies sorts things determined based moral viewpoint. government actually give rights engage commercial agreement like. privilege allowed engage some. gov say nope others. BACK WORK BACK WORK EVERYBODY, IM CHARLIE IM CHARGE well “look new job”, rather “quit spot” title implies  company wfh months made us come back heavily restricted office height pandemic. People asked little flexible considering smoothly transitioned remote work short notice. Morale basement whole time. go home early due weather boss told us take laptops home case able get back office next day. say months ""we remote policy"" response ask telecommuting rubbed everyone wrong way. think going hard hyper rigid companies maintain position constant conflict employees. think we're going see flood articles soon business people musing ""pandemic employee disengagement"". people loved group projects school. people work better (or think do) directly working someone else. 

There also workers get most/all social exposure work miss relationships. I've working home 11 years I'm top department globally.

That’s even monetizing cost time wasted Commute.

I agree karma race post, ways around that, I’m fan new rule.  Ur right. I'm protecting family they're vaccinated already think could live knowing might give someone might give family member such, death ultimately morally traced kinda. Thanks. ‘top 9 cohorts’ vaccinated least one dose.

  would say cons extremely small compared pros. 

Con: may feel like crap day two. everyone bus many people get flu like symptoms (fever, fatigue, chills) 12-48 hours. 

Pros: prevent getting potentially serious illness. Yes 18 year old risk death low, sick 2 weeks still sucks. 

The bigger pro though help protect whole family community. Everyone gets shot part save thousands even millions lives around world. also allow society return normal sooner.


All cons opinion seem like small price pay help make world much better place. I'm french, anyone else power would've meant millions dead (the rest goes racist full violent). Yes. optimistic timeline we're living rn problem people wise, never really want much power know dangers it, means science-denying batshit crazy people get power spread false agenda wise roll eyes.

Mutant recent genetic change. Variant comes “variant concern” public health outcome implication good, short lived. Young people get vaccinated.

Claiming n industry give shit want keep masses ignorant paints simplistic picture. often boring science people competing viral marketers propagandists winning attention extremely stupid people. Extremely stupid people also extremely disinterested reading anything longer two lines. also educated people know better making erroneous claims they're lazy read up. think it’s necessary point, case numbers quite high. 3-4 weeks stricter measures enough bring case growth back control give vaccination campaign time work.

Also, vaccines proven effective mutations already. visit grandma now?

Yet dissenting view immediately squelched Jews never caught break I’m American maybe theres simple answer this, certain states law enforcement encouraged ask “papers” anyone “looks” like they’re South Central America. would different? California literally announce reopening date? announce mask-mandate ending date later, people need relax. Masks *should* one last things go. Ok thanks info, curious since didn’t hear anything flu shot  political decision, good public policy.

Changing mask mandates particular matter messaging primarily, matter inducing economic harm. almost wholly unenforced.

This pandemic proved one thing—republicans bow money. I’m also Minnesota don’t doubt science behind cold area MO said, bringing anecdotal experience winter.  doubt didn’t need hockey season all. 

Chaska Chan, ref passed away, well Shakopee saw huge spikes Covid cases 2 weeks school went back person. back ice January 15th things pretty calm first 6 weeks so. schools opened back up, like hell broke loose teams shut positive cases everywhere. 
Many district 6 teams (chaska chan, Waconia, Eden Prarie, Shakopee) didn’t wear masks ice either, frustrating hell. 

So yeah, don’t know transmission happened hockey rink, classroom pizza party tournament. know clicking along fine hockey schools went back person.   AZ one even approved US? Toronto, ON. using 

site requirements CA. going late compared rest country. everyone access vaccines April 19th, June 1st - middle June, open country up. gives everyone adequate time want get anyway choices hold us back. problem (most) people want office every day get upset &amp; annoyed others WFH. them, actually makes less special can't talk &amp; interrupt person. there's also stigma less work home i'm sure return soon offices open back up. I’m vaccinated governor said stop. hell still required.

Buddy, think governor knows science works knows here, that's call. am, know everybody stops wearing masks state going hell handbasket 2 weeks later. know vaccination rate 50% we've shown clear disregard social distancing. reamed April (""wahh! wanna wear mask"") December (""I'm tired caring, want party!"").

My kids fortunate enough supportive school district apparently handle remote learning leaps bounds better lot kids there. three get instruction 5 days week. I'm positive little guy getting everything music art classes, middle son undoubtedly cheating PE, academically three learning lot. grades holding least high in-person (our district allowed choice). Cutting school density really helped cut disease spread fall, point seems worthwhile push summer. oldest getting first shot next week. Hopefully schools back normal next fall.

My question this: lose? deny wearing mask helps everyone? care? personal freedom worth getting economy going again? I’m pretty social, part life outside work. don’t really feel need gossip water cooler. I’d rather working home don’t commute, turn makes possible meet actual friends drinks/workouts/etc earlier. hobbies time for. 

Finding irl people share interests nigh impossible live mountain hours away nearest population center. companies operate. works people willing leave get money. Like invade? Work home mean *have* home.

Go cafe library hours work instead sitting couch miss social interaction. math. used drive 50 miles way, 5 days week. It’s roughly 29-31 days year...a year!

Sturgis caused like 200k+ infections apparently weeks event, months-long protests across country millions people not, apparently. super bowl spike, real evidence outdoor transmission beaches/etc, yet NFL games also seems issue? 

We need consistent messaging. Well, needed long time ago. There's zero chance US protests lead spike coronavirus cases. would, would young professionals. “Water cooler talk” critical networking, well social interactions young professionals need.  think long government make vaccine mandatory neither publicly funded university prob works minimum wage job. literally get compensation,

Trust science wait herd immunity start dropping restrictions. US 30 percent vaccinated, that's simply, factually, high enough let guard yet.

Telling people need vaccinations stop wearing masks also drives vaccinations. return normal early, removes incentive lot people get shots. Again, ideal, I'm even saying necessarily agree it, true Breast milk exchanges going since COVID-19. Moms donate extras, sell moms don’t produce enough. places test milk give paperwork saying it’s drug disease free. papers generally shown purchase milk. It’s news people seeking milk COVID-19 antibodies. clear plastic bag? prevents 100% deaths Covid also good stimulus affected pandemic That's problem.

The science CDC *never* going say ""there safe time stop wearing masks"". bad then. Good advice little late. figured shoulder workout today! Feels better already. I'm assuming million middle aged people lost parent covid hope know love like one day.

Yeah lady, us also reproduce even necessarily think US complex. People always blame someone matter well things going. Political divide real people use metric supports argument blame someone else. know that. bar restaurant, say, guarantee they're offering Covid-free experience may well attractive selling point right now. Prevent breakthrough infections (95% efficacy means 5% vaccinated people still get sick) selective pressure new variant  Trust science (unless it’s inconvenient) Monica Ghandi, infectious disease doctor, said everyone wants vaccine get one, keep mandating masks. okay keeping mask ""we're together"" kind thing, around mid June school people plenty opportunity get doses, think time drop them. I'm ready see people's faces again. People going eager go night out, bet could halve capacity, double prices (or more) make bank. realized week statement applies business too. deleted comment i'll reply anyway.

I'll agree Fall. Everyone risk opportunity vaccinated then. Lets put full efforts getting every vulnerable vaccinated then.

Then lets simply let kids kids. Time stop burdening this.

- concerned Father. Seriously? can't even get first dose teacher. think understand. going happen. federal government authority mandate it. Without cooperation fifty states, would fifty individual databases. Good thing isolating kids year-plus won’t impact secondary effects loosen dress code allow kids wear want school Dope. Appreciate time effort man. mentioned situations certainly unique offer different options. Cool hear you’ve hit equilibrium thanks sharing perspective Even antibodies wane time, cells likely long lasting. won’t really need either hit heard immunity 1-3 months. NY really numbers. I've watching them. live NY. They've trended tad nothing crazy. can’t plan fully reopen increasing level cases NY. good folks CNN hope... Link ruling Parkinson’s? waiting? I'm US citizen Germany flew back US get two weeks ago. Stayed weeks visit family such. Second shot days. less available adults everywhere. reckon end month willing adults wil least one shot  discovered late. totally agree. hope you’re right. really hope vaccines speed up. think roll online booking went well. want over. Nobody said were. lot people absolutely going wear mask to, vaccinated not. Work one retail shift pandemic see it. Look anti-mask protests see it. Look Capitol riots see it.

Doing away mandates vaccinated people threshold least 50 percent vaccinated going cause unvaccinated people get sick, people world absolutely cannot trusted right thing, small group would hope.

Sure, rulebreakers going best break rules even mandates, away mandates early telling ""yeah go ahead fine,"" taking away ability businesses want follow rules enforce them. Unless solution proving they've vaccinations, something else nobody wants do. pushback vaccine passports huge.

It's ideal, best right without giving anti-maskers. Fingers crossed! Stay well stated facts

I downvote you, read post, but:
[It's fact unless see didn’t say stop society. said would continue mask, distance, avoid indoor gatherings. said nothing others. child special, me, love causes give best chance healthy life possibly can. hope know love like one day. also care vulnerable members society, continue take simple steps possibly save lives. I’m pretty sure states tried approach getting front line/LTC residents done first. hesitancy slow vaccines beginning go bad pretty much snowballed whoever wants one leap frog aren’t wanting waiting. unused vaccine worthless isn’t somewhere bodies arm. hope get border Canada open soon...would love see lumber price drop Kids can't stay home forever. Risk extremely low them, less flu. large percentage population getting shot unfortunately Heh, let's hope gods opinion. cdc recommends it, states probably comply. follow science  Florida subtropical climate, less yearly flu cases state. still need take precautions, precautions NY NJ. like Texas. state government made weak policies slow spread left policymaking local authorities. authorities, like major cities, took stronger steps protect citizens healthcare resources, overruled undermined state political hacks. Um...Ontario? Nope! Thanks Doug. Yeah adults getting vaccinated everything’s going completely open masks ditched even though kids aren’t protected. Yeah there’s little risk don’t know thing going fuck they’re older. arent capacity restrictions tell Okay headline misleading. may think anxiety hear “brain disease”, point massive important study compares people Covid respiratory infections. 

It shows long Covid real phenomenon range effects it’s thing that’s always observed flu people paying attention bodies heard lot people argue lately. I’m sorry fully well next year ridiculous thing I’ve heard think meant holiday causes delay reporting, hence would normally expect spike cases reported due reporting lag. Also people may put getting tested day holiday. Thanks feedback. Good thing they're giving two doses huh make money getting people watch, informing people. nope. vermont set target date july 4th idea wild mouse surveillance, place like India testing resources scarce, can’t imagine using resources mice people.  safely wear mask then. Well that's start dash hopes Hogan dropping goddamn mandate. see can't even *discussion* removing them. don’t know. saw Alex Jones talking apparently cited study it. know AJ conspiracy theorist, back mind still iffy Well ... defense gyms, pretty standard practice outside pandemic. wanna touch someone else's sweat. That's gross. 

Either that, I'm weirdo wiping everything provided wipes run treadmill.   you. 2 months decide you’ve enough want get back normal like good majority us already have, don’t need announce either. child special. going stop society us illnesses. could proxy immunity given infection early variants, seen anything conclusive that. air gradually gets colder gets closer ice. convection currents (warm air rising colder air). Seems like problem could mitigated powerful ceiling fans blowing force mixing. air mixes, concentration aerosols goes down. restriction large events this: ""Large-scale indoor events, conventions, allowed occur testing vaccination verification requirements.""

this still good policy 1, everybody vaccinated july, largely kids cant get vaccinated yet 2, conventions attended californians entirely possible staters arent vaccinated attend like June everyone access two months No, many states enforced police issuing fines violators public. guess would people kids. definitely easier coworkers kids clamoring get back office. Same. feel people long commutes, suck known bad health. 

If job announced permanent WFH I’d find somewhere else work lol.  would want go back office 5x week?

I've lucky enough keep working office along. prefer going office. I'm efficient office. since commute 15 minutes, big deal me. mean, kids outside school interacting social group, entire school population. significant difference amount people two groups. Overwhelming strong word information data besides personal experience. husband also got Pfizer shot minutes ago. two vaccine twins. funny thing is, knowing americans even need much money. 100$ get shot....

the line would door. people basically play demolition derby drive half-way across town 3 cents gallon gas. Literally club, sport, social group, theyre going explode people vaccinated. 

I assuming anything, makes much sense find people share interests instead random people work near interest ever going th office tbh. QOL much better able work home, remote whereever whenever. Same. I'm also hard time lack social interaction. want social interactions *friends*. want stay WFH 100%, able spend time friends again. hate corporations trying convince workers social interactions need come workplace. That's bullshit. would want interaction office instead somewhere whatever want say hi walking hallway

Because millions people idea work/life balance need friends office don’t really interests outside work do.

I’m someone literally tone everything personality, interests, hobbies, thoughts comes coworkers, they’re largely total fucking squares. It’s sad reality, people sorta drone along. go work, see family, pass hours mindlessly, go bed, wake again.

There fuckloads people who’s real hobby sitting couch hours every day. Hybrid way forward me. twice week office, rest home. average Americans work two hours day pay morning/evening commute. That's 25% 8 hour work day let's figure:

* 33% recommended housing
* 25% transpiration
* 20% taxes
* Recommended 15% 401k
* ??? health insurance usually something sucks

Avoiding starbucks avocado toast make rich. give enough money get wasted weekends erase pain living moment.

Of course also averages ""recommendations"" usually made special interest group meme'd fabric society. numbers shift income levels frugality say buying car. Still usually lived well means deal pressures ridicule friends, family, romantic partners. 

 also institutional pressure, landlords always joke I've found need deal via attorney remind I'm destitute.. think hard imagine living slums options.  Still cost attorneys even come close would pay better place size. 

I deal police car beat (or one) neighborhood rough.. wanna find dope roll eyes tell get warrant I'll get attorney we'll see gets guy first.

I take public transit despite decent am, tell world still set cater cars. tell public goods viewed welfare least people charge despite fact many riders upper middle class even 1%.  decision makers quietly ride shit save lives figure people choice. extra expenses owning automobile would double actual cost car assuming 1 year loan something.

Nobody genuinely wants live responsibly. US economy even function people did. Ah good job backtracking It’s parity, luxury. work currently providing dedicated space. Don’t dismiss things workplace currently provides want taken seriously. Yup end week usually slowest us two days wfh, really nice able fill work day things in-between work invited 79 year olds NRW . 79 year olds. done going invite 78 year olds . Reddit threads science - shame may studied would hardly blame pharmacists combing reddit.. trade brainless Facebook friends bragging double masking instacart even second shot? keeps trying counter ""what going see class system develop people come office seen committed get recognized promoted often it.""

Sounds fine me. I'm interested getting promoted. like do; would want go management? pandemic taught illiterate people are. People comment article Fauci stating vaccines proven provide immunity least 6 months (because first shots given 6 months ago!) people understand immunity lasts 6 months, saying doomed whatever.

I really words, cannot blame scientists wordings, average person stupid cannot read. Awesome news. Hopefully find it, sucks getting 1 doses told can't get second round knowing much protection have. Good, long distancing required.  I'm mid 30's, grew online never made new connection online. I've ever used online communication augment existing irl relationships. genuinely understand one would go thing. “The risk complications healthy children higher flu compared happening bc boss bavaria wants bossof germany half year. Okay. main point risk factor identified.


Didn't know cliincial picture difference. even means. 
“The risk complications healthy children higher flu compared Basically: life complicated everyone opinion. 

lol Personally reasons don’t work me.

The precision, accuracy, speed drawing object mouse can’t compare hand marker. times needed explain backend developer why/how design corresponding UI component. one instance time crunch, swiftly draw idea him. times would instantly drop start jotting ideas mix. Thankfully got solution pronto started developing solution . know I’m explaining somewhat vague, trust me, wouldn’t done swiftly typical white-board app. Maybe Wacom pen something would’ve gone well. 

In contrast, couple weeks ago, dev trying convey idea us using Microsoft Whiteboard app - think that’s it’s called. writing resulted bunch terrible scribbles , although app autocorrect boxes tried make. least clear. I’m sure real handwriting would’ve lot better. 

I feel like whiteboard app ok you’re conveying teammate nowhere near office - like different state. moments need on-demand collaboration, basic whiteboard marker best opinion . time start filming ""Madea's Family Quarantine"" NFL games fans...picture Jaguars...choose one.  Ah makes sense. Good (and staff!) Depending test got, COVID tests, especially early pandemic, pretty high false negatives - like 20%+

You may actually COVID could pinpoint exact problem situation: lack vaccines. entertainment, plus folks get shots better doc, obviously, suspect saying least awhile masks thing situations. another response clearly says thinks masks normal things like flu season, also clearly says mandated, hopes people use them. nice think say vaccine may true. New York vaccinating way faster us still lot cases. Michigan slightly behind us cases skyrocketing. 

My theory LA maybe California developed partial herd immunity winter got hit bad. temporary protection mixed vaccines, suspect we’ll never surge Yup, sad truth. think they'd learn famous reports bias designing crash test dummies (only using average male size weight ignoring females). Fuck business usual. Way better cubicle lmao. I’m dreading this. I’m almost certain company require everyone come back full time. means 45-60 mins driving (one way), gas mileage, wear tear car, much free time lost. I’m considering giving ultimatum LEAST hybrid schedule, I’m afraid they’d call bluff. watch movie Good Company. probably realistic scenario you. think necessarily boundaries problem. live 1 bedroom apartment. room desk big enough work equipment use, need use dining table. means walk 5 feet work couch/living area. can't wait get back get kitchen table back.

It's also feasible work Starbucks library reason using kitchen table, due equipment have. typically work past normal 9-5, however lot harder decompress turn work work 5 feet relax.

I love aspects working home without doubt. Unfortunately outweigh downside. French preference home-grown products though, anyone bit unsure likely swung that.

I know lot French people, wonder don’t buy British cars! knew... clear yet. pessimistic signs say safe next fall. optimistic ones say will. know fall bring. Right seems safe enough kids back school, enough bad signs I'm sure right decision. variants spreading get worse kids summer (kids unvaccinated unlike adults) safe. Wow Europe shady hell. Surprised 34% Yep, that's exactly article conveying. friends work, don’t friends. offices do! general love coworkers! also friends outside work desire return commuting. I'm boat you. started insanely happy deal people going public, 've since learned really need counteracting force natural urge live rock. 2/3 day split sounds like it'd great mixture. think many people going realize coming years WFH really limits personal connection upward mobility. Meanwhile I, basically hermit, NEVER work office manage it. I’ve never happier terms work life. isn’t banned here? I'm trying understand tiny gas tank $25 fill, yet inefficient fill 2-3 times week 40 min commute. like hyundai elantra tank hummer lol Indiana people started eating restaurants late April 2020 large numbers, Christmas started seeing people without masks grocery store. mandate lifted yesterday, judging drive past see store Hoosiers declaring victory going life normal.

Gladly wife vaccinated. bought novartis factory used fabricate vaccines expertise staff already place. Huh?

It ""totally meaningless"" talk current statistic relates historical statistics, statistic locations?

The article specifically talking week March 29 April 4, stating period, UK one lowest numbers COVID deaths Europe.

Considering came from, that's pretty incredible result ""meaningless"" all. everyone alone introverts happy. one forced go back work full-time to, judgment people appreciate social interaction thread seems really misguided. work home WAY underpaid, could pretty easily get 10-20k+ bump looked something new work one best job markets world tech (Dallas, Tx). Im year half mark review, ive asked boss like yea 3 years since last review.

They know us aint going anywhere working home worth pay bump. one gets reviews 2 people left year half ive here. pay job great though. 

Sleeping till 8 much time kids worth pay bump. Would know though? cameras you? every industry hasn't. fact many people realising work home exactly I'm talking about. profession already working remotely also happens vulnerable outsourcing clearly comparable jobs discussed. Sounds like real standup guy there. would kill able spend time family go watch toddler draw breaks. Yeah get inflation raise without damn good excuse indicate I'm pleased start look options. skillet half brain plenty work Touch grass please love [Lee Mack bit ...so, ""spread air"" (airborne transmission), spread water droplets lungs fell onto people sitting front below.

Shame smh.com.au sensationalized headline know, think vaccine checkpoints/passports either. pointing people would put risk unvaccinated people public places. rise, exhausted home, angry queues, never see kids aside dinner bed

This biggest one me. extra \~$1000/month pocket saved expenses nice, extra sleep, reduced stress, ability spend actual quality time kids really improved quality life. 

Before, wake unrested, commute, work, commute, homework, dinner, bath time, bed time, repeat. sleep enough, work homework done 4pm, rest day whatever kids.

A return previous schedule *only* steep pay cut, would guaranteed depression. I'm asked return full time, I'll definitely looking another job. read shit toilet  Bingo. There’s border team, might maybe see person within year?

I know hobbies, share pet photos, (comical) remote birthday celebrations, name it. long work gets done, sometimes split 1:1 time almost 50:50 personal work talk. Engagement scores soar genuinely love managing team. mean, make lot assumptions life, job, coworkers comment. Maybe I’m outgoing social person strike conversation anyway job allows happen quite frequently friendly coworkers? best work experience ever office fully in-person everyone doors offices open everyone could talk easily coordinate projects other. fun! People socialized got know really well, people needed help something response near-instantaneous. Nothing remote come close me. I'm less productive I'm remote (I terrible focusing work instead getting distracted online I'm alone) make close connections coworkers. also started summer last year, really depends company. 

We Teams chat going ask questions day, also joke around sometimes. 

The atmosphere person, still helps quite bit. 

Honestly though, saving close $4000 year least, plus 2 hours day. Cant get better this. 

Ideally, would love get office 4-5 times month, perfect blend over. way would ever go back commuting packed subways 5x day. mean that’s terrible thing absolutely legal using justification something else legal. Well first paragraph Perfect amount give us want redesign office socially distant workspace want go back. ended taking lateral position work remote. much better way Must tough going life stupid are. place go fully remote understand would refuse stay remote. know don't; people charge set ways refuse learn/understand current technology.

But positive financial impact paying rent, lowering insurance costs, increased productivity...

of course applies jobs done fully remotely. people less productive home probably less productive office well. also plenty people sit around fuck day office. Good. I'm sure plenty jobless people mind horrors (s/) work office. agree people saying longer necessary used wasteful... , little perspective fact actually job that's probably relatively great could used people. Literally resigned current company one offers 100% remote work options. Fuck man hard-working middle-aged person life outside work, sound like kind worker drives us crazy: newbs think professional legitimacy directly proportional overwhelmed stressed are.

That's OK, though. probably learn eventually. first thought arbitrary cut off, really much difference risk someone 29 30?

I'm 35 take whatever vaccine offered me. worried previously. Ну расскажи тогда мне, промытому кремлеботу, сколько же врачей выпало и как они критиковали Путина. pandemic really good year financially.

First: commute. Saved $4k year(incl lower insurance)

Second: stimulus checks($6400 wife I)

Third: lower interest rates (refinanced saving $2300/yr)

Total pandemic savings=$12,700

Not even including fact cooking home, go out, take vacation. I'm happy things returning normal... also... Damn! flu vaccine beginning century proved young women particular received much vaccine necessary. degree effectiveness, half dose sufficient, fewer side effects. World Health Organization also recommended 2010 physiological differences men women included standard future research, happened corona vaccines.

Irresponsible, unacceptable 2021 they're still considering biological gender differences (not unlike melanin yielding inaccurate pulse oximeters results). differences could tip scale terms major side effects efficacy. Damn right! want see ugly faces office even less waste 2-3 hours day commute see get back home get away them. Nothing fun kicking sales goobers floor back pit commissioned despair. show looking updates boss, toast.  Well I'm one would hiring you, would let go actually work. Congrats!! I'll joining end month! Yes kicked establishment wearing shirt, yes even age fairly public information don’t goddamn right know medical history go see movie. Must nice Yeah say obesity problem racist nearly productive office. Plus miss socialization aspect too

It's funny see pair thoughts many times comments. mocking anything, many people saying feel less productive home also miss socializing - potentially unproductive distraction work work everyone involved. Couldn’t agree more! onboarded remotely last year too, never felt connected work team. quite depressing new hires. quit last month starting new job hybrid schedule, hope it’s gonna better. usually too, latest place single standard socket light bulb...they're like e14 something weird, GU24...

Not exactly something thought check walk through. I’ve worked extra time. still prefer it. No, relax. develop symptoms take test. coworker wasn’t showing symptoms guys sat 5ft apart there’s probably like 1/1000 chance you’d catch I'm surprised low 34%. Commuting total waste time money. don’t like going. Don’t need go work done home, don’t need go school go school home, don’t need go get groceries order home. convenience enticing. Wall-E right would come US tho, cause export ban Maybe, would pay service funeral home though ? I’d choose either home nicer place live scared forever?

You wear seat belt cars, right? awesome enough people wore seat belts cars long enough would safe everyone stop?  Surprised higher. need get new job. mention super judgemental negative way think many fellow humans.

I’m sure you’re judgmental plenty ways comes associate with, you’re taking particularly thing personally. New Zealand essentially did, pretty unique case. confidence knowing big deal self esteem. know helped see worth. Yeah, husband go back looking buy new car paying ez pass. updated resume today working old contracting company new remote job fuck that. 5 extra unpaid work hours week

I think I'd want go back commuting even hours became paid. absolutely despise travel / commutes. even live far away, traffic really bad. pandemic hit, boss picked new office. technically closer live, opposite direction 1 particular street traffic is, commute actually longer! 

Frick that, frick it. ""so far""... opportunity give mutate higher probability become something worse. Probability mean *going* happen. chance decrease probability, take it? 

I give crap live life people Texas live life, affects us frustrating hell something killed 500k citizens, mention long term effects people suffering from, brushed something worth changing behavior over. This!! much this!! Every time get conversation family WFH boomers shocked idea staying home anyone age 35 (including myself) similar mindset, would literally rather quit go back office full time.

Have ever heard concept bullshit jobs? London School Ecinomics professor David Graeber came concept exploring many people, especially young people, miserable jobs conclusion huge amount ""bullshit"" pencil pushing jobs people work often know it. think there's really funny thing boomers, generation, value ""work"" else - put quotes seems obsession anything related work. members generation know well enough seem *like* personal life restricted job things. Like soon step dad talks getting early go office working late make travel time meetings, almost sounds wistful. beyond confusing me. thinking framework bullshit jobs, think that's coping mechanism became part culture - convince like bullshit else feeling way makes *better person* job inherently good even bullshit. That, came time could pay college little elbow grease, support 5 person family suburbs one salary. now, think lot face fact really, really need working hours they've convinced they're working, like fish water.

On top that, I've noticed conservative boomer (or person general) seem want go back. Maybe there's layer wanting structure hierarchy office environment, since two things conservatives tend value more? general older generations tend around conservative younger ones, surprise younger people ones want stay home.

I never want go back office - focus much better work, get done faster, still social time coworkers *that like* before/after work calls, dont make bullshit small talk, sneak house chores day. want end hours early Friday, work late Thursday early Friday pack car go camping lunch hour. mention amazing much time connect SO, taking already awesome relationship literally dreamy. just...cannot fathom people would voluntarily give up. Fuck sitting traffic Yeah convince people....Smh reddit sucks sometimes.  Absolutely. I’ve already made clear two directors I’m resigning force us back office full time. think might one big opportunity take back bit freedom make grind bit less grind. way going let go waste. made two appointments people age group, asked choose date two hours later next day, time couldn’t choose pick date next day.  people office chose work office entire time. Two older men would honestly surprised even internet home. One person tried working home month came back office requires elaborate ergonomic set company told could either pay pocket get home office set likes could work office; chose office. appreciate handle person tasks would otherwise come office every day for. Toronto District School Board surgery came 14 percent students prefer online school person  younger group associates come back office, time see standing around coffee machine without masks drinking coffee yucking up. 


I look like aliens point. Must nice commute 1-3 hours day. Pockets exist. Lots people wear masks outside. I'm walking park right half people wearing masks. guy ran past either he's gonna goes store. people town get car masks walking front door store they'll put masks on.  Quick! Everyone, let show shocked face! 

😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳 definitely issues impact COVID lower-income communities, I'm really sure complaint is? Food delivery decrease chances viral transmission, otherwise would grocery workers / restaurant workers etc. getting much higher levels exposure. US military? can't, love sleep way much. never well rested since longer get early get ready work commute. Switching home office seems really disruptive, especially kids. First off, science. ""known facts"". Early on, kids likely asymptomatic (yay!), small subset (&lt;&lt;0.1%) bad long term affects. There's data suggesting new strains worse kids ""main"" ""early"" strains. certainly possible imagine children would vulnerable strains respiratory disease.

Secondly, biggest concern overwhelming hospitals morgues. ways, we're struggling today. US stuck 1-5% infection rate, smoldering away breakout like saw last fall winter. Continuing wear masks we're 80% vaccinated important keep down. moving goal posts, literal simplest, basic thing prevent huge problems.

Thirdly, we've done terrible job lot people misunderstood goals last April. people thought social distancing masks eradicate disease. shut enough that. think, culturally, Americans tolerate it. shut twice hard did, 99%+ mask compliance 90 days, whole thing would long ago -- instead get deniers constitutionalists concerned arguing rights instead public health. ""Flattening curve"" eradicating, keeping hospitals capacity, keeping everything long-term sustainable. Clearly missed goal different regions different times, able get enough natural resistance combined enough people scared enough comply took bring numbers down.

Once vaccinated, specifically need wear mask (according best science). that, there's less pressure keep unvaccinated wearing masks. wear masks infection rates value (0.5%? 0.1?%), 80+% vaccination rates, believe that's it'll safe everyone take masks off.

I like wearing mask. wear glasses can't see breath fogs up. I'm getting 2nd Pfizer vaccine Saturday. I'm going keep wearing mask public governor says stop. reason show everyone raging freedom boner take mask time.  Seriously fuck office work.  one work since going remote? actually excited ability leave office work stop. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. small company worked 2015, outsourcing india shooting foot. system got unusable. tried query something incredibly basic, took 15 seconds retrieve 1 record. 

For AT&amp;T, work. creative / dev job, AT&amp;T simply decided stop trying develop something house. Instead went WYSIWYG commercial software api integration shipped operation overseas. overseas coders work out, lighter work load did. 

Er, mostly worked, heard recently trying assemble another team leads. also reaching many devs worked previously, included. sure for, declined. you, sounds like nightmare. me, sounds like dream come true. started job remotely 2 years ago. never seen person never want see person assume 15 million lost doses week? Bummer bad can't drive truck computer still get paid.

I hope becomes reality day. kind desk home personal computer? That's I'm using much negotiating power office job less competition job. Noda. I'm American, raised near Canada popular resort town brits. grew similar number UK nationals Americans, bit odd blend. International spellings, primarily metric system (especially weights. Even going American school, figure Imperial units weight save damn life unless pounds.)

I'm getting old eyesight great hell ""current situation"" Canada?? I've RTFA three times now. Help! 90% 100%. There's still widespread community transmission many us would rather depend solely vaccine numbers still high. You’re mistaken. It’s airborne, meaning droplets literally traveled air singing. wasn’t contracted via surfaces person-to-person contact. 

That’s means. airborne, would infected almost everyone building, instead people chorister projecting spittle onto.

Not necessarily. Airborne droplets don’t travel nearly far aerosols can. 

[From Respiratory droplets produced exhalation (e.g., breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, sneezing) span wide spectrum sizes may divided two basic categories based long remain suspended 1. **Larger droplets visible fall air rapidly within seconds minutes close 2. Smaller droplets particles (formed small droplets dry quickly airstream) [aerosols] remain suspended many minutes hours travel far source air currents.

See **aerosols:** [*By definition, aerosols suspensions air (or gas) solid liquid particles, small enough remain airborne prolonged periods low settling OP link clearly says airborne droplets singing, aerosols, surfaces, person-to-person contact. one actually like job hate stuck room day. Except foreign workers cheaper. it’s clean comparison.

Also mental shift “I need people office” “I need someone work”. promise someone Asia better job, unless job heavily based contacts requires local experience. content warning *""oh shit dude took much, someone going call cops, I'm never going come again""*, misunderstanding meaning 'very high'? work software engineering like me, around engineers developers benefit WFH. Working giant place much egos arrogance fucking killing me. way get away personalities. went engineering grandfather told us engineers worst people work with. absolutely right. incredibly true. People hired good enough wage get say “yes” offer, wage stagnates 3-4 years causes quit early seek money elsewhere. also notice lot companies prefer hiring seniors/managers externally instead promoting employees positions. 3-4 years optimistic, people change jobs every 8-9 months country, it’s considered normal. Good good. 4x10 work week easily best benefit job. Think much every one works 5x8 loves occasional 3 day weekend. imagine good feel happens every single weekend. Incredible. takes little time adjust couple additional hours work day worth me. Bummer. Yes, Sinovac vector, like Sputnik V referencing non existent huge, growing gap Delivered Administered doses, grown consistently amount 2nd doses still needed. people actually give shit maybe keep mind case see suspect something similar. Canadian citizens living america guess. quarantine 2 weeks arrive assume much work full time home, odds job isn’t essential. me. 
I incredibly sick room 24/7.

I also find zoom meetings constant attempts connect digitally really annoying.
Working home felt like massive violation personal space.  moment thought talking Trump incredibly confused. minimal ""supposedly"" - *miniscule*.

You, course, you, unlikely making impact all. always cases virus. pandemic end, disease going anywhere. wash everything then? flu season (or hell, anytime - still catch flu July!)? ask rude, point maybe worth rethinking.  Maintaining culture toxic positivity exhausting. I’ll take paycut let someone else that. said medical boards media Jesus christ.

Before throwing names someone online actually read written. that’s Biden difference  companies barely pay more. wife's company constantly losing people train pay significantly less other, much smaller companies. bullshit around.  Well say voluntarily, understand serious problems urban planning US. I'm referring people work downtown live 20 miles away suburbs complain pay parking? says Rite Aid available near me, go website get ""We sorry!""

Remotely wanted feel like waste 75% week going office (precious job) could done home 95% time computer. Well that's I'm even implying. everything goes less planned, every adult willing vaccinated (75% 80%) gotten first dose end June. something like AstraZeneca thing (or something worse) happens 70% ordered vaccines arrive, date August September worst.

So definitely need lockdowns coming fall people know (at least Germany do). also know strict lockdown still rational choice protect weaker friends family. Yes that’s important distinction make. still feel like 1 dose charts valid since gives lot protection + UK also it. yes know quite people adult children move home either would otherwise entirely own/lost job college/university shut campus moved online curiculum. 1 people pushing move back office 4 adult kids move back covid.

Anyone idea Curevac going finish phase 3 report efficacy? They’re another mRNA vaccine likely going really important ending global pandemic. *not* everyone vaccinated? Depends long commute is.

The articles great work home many people love it. And, yes, many do.

But large group, maybe 50%, deeply want return office. 

So say, want 100% office, 0% office others between. job create infrastructure processes support above. enough what? lowered number covid cases fairly predictably. anything, data suggests harsher methods unnecessary milder lockdowns work.  France even anti-vax US. lot people afford picky ones risk. going shitty companies managers get exposed people unnecessarily forced back work leave smarter companies. would *love* hybrid schedule. I’ve way productive working home. know people felt like shit after. know people fine afterwards.
Idknit hit people different.

I'm really hoping I'm one lucky ones since cannot take anytime work. It’s irrational concern. flu deadlier complications otherwise healthy young people covid. even stated explicitly CDC website politically motivated hit piece, shitty piece reporting. stenography lobbyists opinion effort fact check. publication obligation report whole story, try that's brand. Like Atlantic. 

Opinion journalism one thing, factual centered reporting different. Otherwise makes everyone dumber, might Rebel's goal, I'm pretty sure Atlantic's I'm you. I'm hardware designer working home pain butt. Sure, could schematic design PCB layout computer, talking design idea coworker person works much better. I'm part design cycle need lab equipment often company requested work home need lab equipment. 

I fully vaccinated company hosting vaccination sites employees end April middle May. best bet back office June. employees offered 2 shots, convenient location (aka job). board then, that's you. company provided 160 hours COVID-related PTO use year use vaccine side effect recovery too. February 21, 2021, 46 million persons received least 1 dose mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.8 total 3,643,918 persons enrolled.

Most participants reported injection site reaction (dose 1: 70.0%; dose 2: 75.2%) systemic reaction (dose 1: 50.0%; dose 2: 69.4%) days 0 7 vaccination (Table). frequently reported solicited local systemic reactions first dose COVID-19 vaccine injection site pain (67.8%), fatigue (30.9%), headache (25.9%), myalgia (19.4%). Reactogenicity substantially greater second dose vaccines, particularly systemic reactions, including fatigue (53.9%), headache (46.7%), myalgia (44.0%), chills (31.3%), fever (29.5%), joint pain (25.6%). 
 
A greater percentage participants received Moderna vaccine, compared Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, reported reactogenicity; pattern pronounced second dose (Table). stratified age (&lt;65 vs ≥65 years), differences reactogenicity vaccine remained consistent overall findings (data shown). Local systemic reactions less commonly reported v-safe participants 65 years older compared younger 65 years, greater reactogenicity second dose observed age groups (eFigure Supplement). doses vaccines, percentage v-safe participants reported local systemic reactions highest day 1 vaccination declined markedly day 7. 
 
The frequency reported reactions generally consistent results observed clinical trials.4,5 Data millions v-safe participants indicate injection site pain common first second doses either mRNA-based vaccine. Systemic reactions, including fatigue, headache, myalgia, chills, fever, joint pain, occurred participants first dose, although frequently reported second dose among Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccine recipients. Persons 65 years older reported less reactogenicity younger persons. Limitations v-safe include voluntary participation via opt-in smartphone-based system includes less 10% vaccinated persons. 
 
Although local systemic reactions expected often transient, may immediate influence patients’ perceptions vaccination experience. Setting expectations patients may alleviate potential anxiety elicited postvaccination reactogenicity. Clinicians counsel vaccine recipients solicited local systemic reactions commonly reported first day following second dose; short period symptom resolution expected. Reinfection statistically zero, definitely way protected already got COVID.

Seems pretty me. 

If better different source saying otherwise, I'd love see it. rate reinfection low worth worrying about, least short Fall COVID surging hospitals full people COVID, want visit hospital dense since probability encountering someone higher

When said fall, early fall. Like September. Cases up, surging yet (not like Halloween). clarified. trip general check up, actual issue putting freaking non-contact curbside pickup ridiculous. expect get food?

We get far argument, us immediately combative other's statements backed away. sure hell wasn't. fine letting drop, going stand ground willing lose friendship pushed hard reason.

I know realized wrong back away also realized going take us bad path. rarely mad sent ""actively making pandemic worse"" left wing media definitely less guilty spreading COVID misinformation.

I say true, tell. really bothers take fact turn much fear mongering much possible still directly lying something. Yep like eBay. Pziler like Amazon. vast majority young people recover covid zero complications, many don’t symptoms. 

The flu deadlier complications otherwise healthy young people. stated explicitly CDC website. send link don’t believe it. Thing crazy job requirements jobs want news, grass green Aren’t getting little ahead yourself? There’s currently COVID vaccine that’s approved FDA. It’s emergency use authorization far. wait approval making mandatory. Isnt AstraZeneca also huge? then? reason won’t compliance another lockdown people like indignantly refusing anything. they're ICU, they'll like ""We good people, fair dying like this."" morale improve do? Obviously, beatings. They're beaten properly, story goes. Yeah countries slave wages computers internet single family homes own................/s checkmate coronavirus That's shame. think vaccine passports good idea. Unless sort legit medical reason access reason vaccinated, I'm sure want around you. I'll take “No Shit Sherlock” 400$ please, Alex. vast majority young people recover covid zero complications issues. Many don’t even symptoms Kids can't get vaccinated yet. NCL requires negative PCR test board kids. sucks. Totally 100% worth though. Luckily, Spring Break, I'm missing work.

That's info, that's good stuff. 

It's funny said mom side effects. Everyone know side effects younger. Every 70-something Rotary club shot zero side effects. 34 &amp; completely knocked ass! Cite paper One thing certain, Covid revealed complete uselessness expensive administrators public schools. 50 different chiefs district titles coordinator, coach, director absolutely nothing shutdown. put together haphazard plans return full 3 year old could invented back napkin. Surprised boards aren’t cutting top heavy staff. Instead they’re cutting teachers. pricey employees didn’t come school buildings still haven’t even vaccinated. Every state different, guess! Indiana made prove age snd residence gave insurance card. worries WFH culture really taking off. Jobs outsourced, pay drop due hiring pool becoming massive, companies consider laying workers WFH people report working efficiently home large team won’t necessary. WFH sounds nice think future implications worse temporary benefit “working pajamas commute” Mods apparently made rule posting them. “We’re going live Ch There's confirmed cases prior Nov 19 absolutely plausible afraid vaccine passports, stay home It’s majority y’all hypochondriac attributing every bodily change covid. aunt convinced covid making skin constantly itchy. It’s bullshit beatings continue morale improves. mean go apply then... old ""they got better me"" stance really great argument. Fact many jobs completely doable home better work life balance, companies want best people offer flexibility get them. 24 hours. thought getting away symptoms took get me. should. state US education embarassing. fact, cringe **moar**. last straw one trust administration says. However, worth noting government decided stop counting deaths year ago, number dead people known two independent groups respected news conglomerates Brazil go information every day. stay home concerned disagree statement. I'll point stand group bring discussed clearly based UK. guess - decades pop culture mutants monsters superhero movies. probably trying avoid stigma. 1.5+ years Covid kills 3 million. Tuberculoses kills 1.5 million people per year. don’t shutdown panic TB stay home mean, country used proof recent vaccinations enrolled. dont anymore. find preety ok ask me, moreso pandemic. Okay, Texas Florida, two states way fewer restrictions basically better rates California. know Europe's deal specifically. Considering US, appears though 100million people vaccinated thusfar. That's third population. includes vulnerable, generally older population first responder type people. numbers getting vaccinated continues rise. Yet mandating lockdowns masks. understand it. Yesterday went book mine one available hours around May 3 snagged literally disappearing eyes

Now I'm wondering try sources cancel find something sooner People stop commenting perspective “I knew that, me
good science bad” - think don’t know science works apparently - pandemic don’t know everything it. Science cannot decide things without sure - either sure cut risk. Even suspect stuff cannot RISK right. That’s pseudo-science Couch scientists think great - don’t remember wrong (which case medical advices count thousands even millions deaths) remember right - creates feeling superiority. like watching millionaires easily saying answers without money line (but case it’s peoples lives). 
Science doesn’t know everything constantly making mistakes thanks getting real answers. 
There one person thinks restrictions fun (well, always someone ;)) - it’s really crazy think that. restrictions protect people didn’t 100% answers.  Crazy contrast hopelessness exactly year ago current situation. remember wondering I’d ever get crowd plane I’m vaccinated booking family trips headed amusement park weekend. 1%? Lol. Positivity rate meaningless testing numbers low, you’re vaccinated you’re supposed get tested generally, positivity rate quite meaningless. Also, vaccinations required indoor dining theatres pipe dream, gonna happen US meaningful scale 10+ years ago older generation telling us careful misinformation internet, 2020’s eating up. I'd avoid reading lot whats subreddit Fantastic graph comparing side effects reported Pfizer &amp; Moderna (w/ percentages) based 3million vaccinated people. Side effects slightly w/ Moderna - speculate could due dose size, larger w/ Moderna (100micrograms Pfizer's 30micrograms), spite similar efficacy. Probly “burn down” type I’m nyc seems preparing continue delaying normalcy pandering anti vaxxers call “vaccine hesitant.” don’t care get vaccine. really don’t care. everyone 16 get vaccine, everyone 16 safer covid flu; it’s insane restrict people based people actively choosing get vaccinated

I’m covid passports think someone gets hospitalized dies covid; separate calculations eligible within past 4 weeks.

It’s crazy going pandering deaths people actively choose protect within handful weeks major chunk are: 
 
Anxiety disorders: 17% 
Mood disorders: 14% saying dumb Americans would benefit social credit system correct shortcomings. cdc. kids ended pills rest life tender age 13 virus messing heart. fact people shown interest goal *not* getting covid regardless health stats fucking mind boggling. No, means statistically significant correlation. lol. almost got admire sheer brazenness 24 year old ""unpaid carer"" vaccine scam literally getting publicity first person UK receive Moderna.

""why need vaccine? Oh erm.. I'm unpaid carer! (genius!). care for? Oh shit... ermmm.... know who's old? Oh yeah! grandmother! old! works!"" No....it doesn't. looked every post. vast majority news they're slanting monger fear around vaccine passports shit, well organizing protests/marches. There's couple doctors/articles posts, many, quoting things taking context. actually looked posts? incredibly wrong content. trying say? happened Reuters article posts doses administered info? come sub those. haven’t seen one days. Wait, real? thought posted reporting delayed due holiday.

What kind backwards ass, fucked-in-the-head troglodyte thought it'd good idea prohibit tracking vaccinations subreddit pandemic? know conspiracy theories make dumb people feel smart, impossible talk them, narrow minded idiots Why?

Good luck :) Yep found fully remote job August. going amazing I'm fully vaxxed Hard know credible scientists originally said need wear mask.  rugby (which one major sports SA) “throwing dummy” “side-stepping” become part everyday vernacular certain extent.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* many people also fact always locked home, 'work time' mixed 'times'. really crappy psychological consequences. cry want extra month restrictions? think it'll Armageddon restrictions lift June opposed July? blame people skeptical we've told ""just another 2 weeks"" ""another month"" year. 

Your anger bitterness palpable. Maybe confined house arrest year miserable.  NEVER supposed go-to way dealing covid, fucking incompetent they?

you idea... aware 40% registered Democrats believe hospitalization rate covid 50%, correct? “most wrong” group. outdoor gathering restrictions strict Ontario. 5 people socially distanced outdoor gathering max currently Like Fauci saying nobody needs wear mask. Quite misinformation. may true, meaningless number.

As already pointed out, states large populations. Evaluating per capita certainly sensible.

Also, growth rates percentage positive tests important metrics. virus capable doubling number cases week unrestricted.

At time last year, Italy outsized proportion world's cases. handling poorly countries, unlucky enough early arrival virus.

We need news reports focus meaningful metrics educate people matter. need hyperbolic headlines leave important issues undiscovered. Bro work living, working since start pandemic. go punch now. Nice try though means won’t large surge positive tests cases people like call following Texas rangers game Me: Oh interesting, maybe they'll make like good ol' days much hygeine theater masks required, distancing, etc. People might actually go vaccine ID Norwegian cruise lines incorporate safety protocol developed Healthy Sail Panel, task force put together Royal Caribbean. Protocol includes testing, mask-wearing, sanitizing more. 

Aaaaaand nope. I'm guy loves cruises fully vaccinated, fuck lol. expect people get vaccinated, ship fully vaccinated people, keep protocol? Can't imagine many customers masking/distancing/testing/etc done away with. Yeah thought pandemic. literally lowers chance 5%, ok.... anyone read article, headline?

This actually best article subject I've ever read, conclusion ""1 3 Covid cases causes nuerological psychiatric problems.""

First off, 25% issues mood, anxiety, psychiatric disorders, like 1/3 people suddenly developing physical neurological issues Covid.

Second, great graphs showing incidence different issues (stroke, mood/anxiety, nerve disorder, etc.) Covid another respiratory tract infection. Unsurprisingly, incidence higher Covid - Covid serious disease run mill respiratory tract infection!

For example, 2% people stroke within six months Covid, 1.5% people stroke within 6 months different RTI. graphs showed, pretty much equivalent across board. issues appear 33% Covid patients RTI patients.

If remove mood anxiety problems (which think completely fair Covid causing anxiety), end 6% random RTI population developing one health conditions, 8% Covid population.

Of course, article also says cannot infer causality. example, people developed dementia Covid RTIs. Covid causing dementia, indicative population studied. Thank done. think needs done prevent future pandemics? well steps need take prevent variants developing? vaccinating majority population enough stamp variants? make less issue. calculated lie. 

I understand this. also understand person told trust, **deliberately** lied us. create trust. opposite. care lied potentially good reason, still lied us.

Dr Fauci deliberately spread misinformation ""for greater good"". still misinformation, much distrust many anti-maskers lie create? never caught covid 2020 past winter, I've vaccinated likely never will. glad dodged bullet ""Prof Mike Weed University Canterbury, studied 27,000 Covid-19 cases, says outdoor gatherings safe accompanied proper risk management."" definitely eye test. VT near top country handled pandemic. I'm delighted Scott handled everything. Kids already show proof go school. like insist study right masks ineffective real world proven are. give rat's ass study shows real world data consistently contradicts it. real world data shows masks ineffective. WTF? WTAF?.. born, growing up, almost drafted fight pointless endless war ""barely lived""? sure replying study-abroad student spent 6 months foreign country deems expert?

Wow. sheer arrogance... understand native-born grown person insight foreigners, future discussion pointless. Farewell. better. UK hasn't, UK running trial vaccine passports large venues, notably FA final. need proof vaccination, proof negative test last week proof positive test last 6 months allowed entry.

There's lot criticism final decision UK struck First I'm involved, I'm Michigan, feeling chill Lockdown they're actively trying strip Whitmer emergency powers.

There compliance fucking year! That's political, that's time been, people can't shit forever.

Keeo masking up, keep testing test more, get vaccines deployed there's asap...not everything solved Lockdown dude. vaccine offered employees school mom teaches at. 25% took shot. would agree. run basically risk overwhelming hospitals serve potential place new variants emerge, general, I'm particularly concerned escape variants tailorable mRNA vaccines are.

Overall spread also going start falling cliff relatively soon come Aug/September, case counts going relatively low. don’t think word means think means. denigrate people *essential* work want, unpleasant fact economic good derived non-essential white collar ""work"" role people play consumers. produce anything comparable essential workers; they're natural result excessive bureaucracy. 

They might well put ""level 8 dark elf"" tax return. calculated lie. option create run masks people needed couldn’t get them. already doctors baking masks could reuse them. appreciating how, noise pre-vaccine COVID fading US, getting easier track charlatans. Berenson Ding made fools themselves, Osterholm gone deep end. Right folks I'm listening seriously Scott Gottlieb one lovely furry Twitter pine marten character, they're ones focusing real-world impacts. vaccine HIV positive same. That's fair. dozens us! Dozens! get covid also neurological psychiatric problems. wonder why! WFH 2 days per week, office 3 days per week...problem solved vaccine maker actually calling lie. actually quite telling Slovakian government specifying way supposedly different. political turmoil mind, surprised really make up. facts contradict I'm saying? I'm literally laying timeline is.

January 15th - son admitted hospital COVID

January 26th - First confirmed COVID case Arizona via Arizona Public Health

So someone wrong here. Either got tested Arizona Public Health never found lying. think likely? 我拿了习同志的疫苗 Hi, 

I've recently accepted college's radiography program. compliance, get immunizations date (varicella). know CDC recommends waiting least 14 days vaccines covid vaccines, I'm wondering exacting why? 

Would decrease immunity response, know vaccine caused potential reaction, etc.? honestly hypocrisy. can't speak UK throwing money problem 100% American thing. American approach everything national level personal level too. Americans love solve problems cash. culture excess. Whether that's good bad I'll leave smarter people figure kind culture. Seeking cheaper, fiscally responsible solutions major problems things. throw cash major problems sort backend. mean bribe Antibody tests arrival foreign country would one option. Good. Unemployment people want work. emergency changed situation, we're approaching end emergency go back normal alongside everything else. thing foreigners able come Serbia get vaccinated, work practice? interested.

As far tell, worked flawlessly lasted. show vaccination center, set. think they've temporarily stopped vaccinating non-residents, I'm sure they'll open centers foreigners soon enough. check national subreddit info every then. anything changes, posted there. 

There quantities AstraZeneca still available, along Sinopharm Sputnik V. Last time abundance AstraZeneca, allowed anyone get it. say Pfizer way along Moderna honestly bothered wait, got Chinese one. 

I'm sure they'll ask get western vaccine want enter EU, though. Still, I'll sleeping slightly better tonight. That’s *really* crazy. There's already enough tourism.

Wealthy countries profit residents foreigners already spent trip, and/or spend money imaginary tax entity sends profits hires workers different countries country they're visiting. alter headline?

 Covid: US rules **federal** vaccine passports It’s late people, ex friend still washes mail. pandemic broken people’s brains. Also fully vaccinated really harmful way thinking makes people want get vaccinated imo. even think need stuff like point, enough people get vaccinated. Imagine letting others make medical decisions guess still preprint though. Needs peer reviewed. terrible example, *not* strict lockdown several months now. It’s one four weeks, reopening calling new variants caused fuckin explosion new cases. Time tell lockdown helps things, you’re wrong act like they’ve living one already cases still risen.

You cannot point single country lockdown failed either reduce cases significantly slow spread modelled epidemiologists done nothing. Lockdowns aren’t perfect often we’ve got. Helping people adjust number would like country adults reading comprehension ability follow conversation well. lmao UK somehow hypocritical investing vaccine production. EU Media Office done good job ... care ""fully vaccinated"" flights sports. got vaccine. one effective vaccines ever made. faith it. put stadium hundreds unvaccinated people I'm going scared *I got vaccine.* Seeing articles events ""fully vaccinated"" convinced lot people actually believe things work.

It's also bit confusing they're wearing masks getting vaccinated, also environment everyone else vaccinated. What's going person's mind think vaccine prevent getting infected infecting others, mask will? make sense. Lol never stopped Science decisions based consensus enough evidence usually doesn’t generate it. I’m saying time science wrong wasn’t enough data - I’m saying interpret science decisions don’t know works. Science created RULE think believe in. Meanwhile Slovakia got product called Sputnik V Russia identical one described Lancet. English sources yet. probably throw out. Lol another good one. facts outdoor transmission pretty clear long time too. case, Poland 'stay home' order since April 2020, yet we've already survived one full wave another one seems subsiding right now. Yeah huge consideration. pathogens similar mechanisms cause similar complications

Sure. Nobody denying that. People talking COVID unlike pathogens, COVID-19 pathogen responsible *current CDC still maintains Flu deadlier complications healthy young people covid. stated explicitly website

\*for healthy young children. believe band talking 16 under. section flu risks highlights children younger 5. interesting COVID relatively low risk 16 demographic. I've seen generally carry viral load. sure think that's relevant conversation complications associated post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. really hope point ""cOvID fLu"" tie virus neurological symptoms incredibly difficult, almost impossible, considering you’re working mostly subjective metrics.

Common *psychiatric conditions* difficult connect COVID. Substance abuse mood disorders generally across board, best studies make efforts establish reasonable controls. obviously there's difference tracking *anxiety* severe *psychosis* new onset *dementia -* conditions likely emerge purely environmental stressors. Lolwut become homosexual permantly? like full moon thing? Like ware-homo? You’re dumb one assuming I’m America absolutely essential. Companies lower budgets tend pay dearly later.

We probably could less marketing managers, middle managers, HR people tho. couldn’t apply jobs? local market basket looking help past year. They’ve even set long tables loaded applications. hard compare countries different definitions Covid death is, many people even tested it, reporting quality varies. 

Excess deaths better, even can't completely sure accurate data areas. Oh I’m sorry aren’t corporations allowed pease regarding business? opinion matter nothing more. Additionally, refuse even acknowledge facts contradict opinion. You’ll see whatever want to, regardless. think important thing realize substituting interactions people life section regarding *who* spend time made laugh. wonder people love office. spend time family friends. 

Get Discord, something. let office family replace real ones. Look CDC saying tho. happens Israel. 5 months vaccine administration moment, studies say chances passing virus less likely vaccinated. difference United States wealthiest (by metrics) best-educated country world. excuse us incredibly stupid. Yeah cdc database everyone who's vaccinated. way verify cards genuine bad they're wage slaves capitalist elites and, therefore, must whatever say. Quitting option there's social safety net everyone buried debt. I'm becoming increasingly convinced lot restrictions theater. Islands aside, every developed nation deal vaccine rolled out. Containment impossible March 2020, shutting restaurants gyms going anything that.

Sure there's argument slowed spread, considering strict lockdown states like New York Michigan dramatic case numbers, I'm tempted wonder instead *delayed* spread. going years understand actual effectiveness restrictions I'm becoming pessimistic them. know know alot deaths reported UK Coronavirus falsely certified, example best mate's nan throat cancer died may last year 86 symptoms covid whatsoever died peacefully. Yet death certificate written Coronavirus... bet would [AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine: EMA finds possible link rare cases unusual blood clots low blood platelets confirms overall benefit-risk remains safety committee (PRAC) concluded today unusual blood clots low blood platelets listed rare side effects Vaxzevria (formerly COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca).

Boo hoo, I, aside brief period unemployment. I'd still rather work home. used back 2017, great. felt less like work play video games, smoke weed, watch TV work. could go doctors appointments, get car serviced, wake go bed later since commute. literally shit. bad there’s norovirus vaccine That’s super interesting, much appreciated!

We’re moving staff towards flexible model. choose often want come work office. you’re 4+ days week, get dedicated desk. want 3-0 days week elect hot desk office online reservation system (so know you’ll desk heading way office. 

Personally, people choose work home better. save lot cash providing office services employees, employees happy working home, win win.

We survey, 5% said wanted come back full time. 30% said times week, rest said 100% work home. whole year getting extra hour sleep commuting, would want go back office 5x week?

They're there. boss held commuting office last March long allowed to, encouraged us same, claiming safe people there. Eventually made WFH mandatory. can't wait get back office. ship sailed long time ago. point time see type lockdowns anywhere. Lol work home developing content medical school curriculum.

My guess behavior \*does\* change start assigning names COVID. aunt uncle, brother, friend, whatever start taking seriously 'implicit' lockdown happens people staying away other. non-compliant people still care, achieve immunity simply getting sick. 


I'm curious see high Michigan's peak get. Peloton yo. Monthly payments cheaper gym first dose astrazeneca last week, would second dose need astrazeneca too?

That's recommended , since completed clinical trials mixing vaccine brands.

Tier 3 - total lockdown non essential businesses open non-contactless service (Tier 4 KFC drive thru opposition party leader put it)

Tier 2 - somewhat normal life everything open, masks distancing gatherings 100 people (10 people ""2.5"" setting briefly used) 

Tier 1 - completely normal life absolutely distancing capacity limits, restriction aside borders ""wear mask public transport"" certainly suggestion restriction maybe 10-20% people see 

I think clear lowest setting we're able get back normal probably helped motivate people comply higher levels needed - much easier put lockdowns know normal life matter weeks away opposed maybe months, maybe 2022 etc etc dont see piles... hidden freezer trucks :-) Florida atm, numbers average european country regarding fighting B.117 (not worst ones, like average ones) infections little bit lower guess (there might lot hidden cases, dont know good testing is), vaccinations, effect clearly visible! Exports India stopped adults vaccinated be, don’t think kids vaccinated right end world. correct. Sweden actually 9th lowest excess mortality europe 2020.

Swedens 7.6% compared Spains 18.9%, Italys 17.4%, UKs 15.1%, Frances 10.4%, Germanys 5.3% Finlands BLUFF: Sweden's approach emulated, unmitigated disaster, (I call success, either), Swedish society society.


As American living Sweden, Sweden done without problems, also reproduceable countries.  
   
Sweden high trust government. means, government says something, majority people listen such, throw petty temper tantrums ""muh freedom"" 
   
Yes, wish would done mask thing earlier and, explained article, wanted based scientific fact. feel like growing consensus masks effective, dragged feet long it.   
  
That said, Swedes also, societally, distant begin with. Making new friends Swedish often feels like massive task. I've international friends girlfriends Sweden. Even Swedish people likely tell you, they've told me, move another city, often difficult make new friends unless work/school/sports brings others. Alcohol helps lot too.   
   
Getting back point though, ps government recommending wear masks, vast majority people seen wearing masks. 
  
As far restrictions. restaurants/bars/cafes regulated social distancing setting. tables 2m apart since pandemic began here. Christmas, bars/restaurants/cafes forced close 8, means there's little reason large crowds.  
  
It's like Sweden running wild. understand people, made pretty strict regulations, go acting like could done anywhere. fast food restaurant workers wear nose even whole face would think right? would think half country would total control cult denied existence virus first place?

By second week May we’ll figuring spare vaccines vaccination rates stall near 50 percent.

We 50000 flu deaths 2020 flu vaccines available zero flu season second half year. many Coronavirus deaths 2022 half population opting vaccine? 

That 50 percent relying long lasting natural immunity hoping variants don’t escape natural immunity. New York Michigan already showing look like. ‘s end world, thing around quite time. good news people choice either get vaccinated roll dice, vaccinated don’t worry idiots sending hospital. Fug seems suboptimal somewhat dangerous people then. Look places locked successfully, failed.

Eg, Australian state Victoria went lockdown stop community transmission, limiting deaths 820 population 6.7 million people.
That 122 deaths per 1 million population, less 1/10th Sweden's per capita deaths. european, seen pattern again, simply B.117 variant contagious. regions sinking numbers quite time B.117 hit infections slowly started rise realtively quickly surging again. Usually came combination school reopenings reopenings drove infections even faster. end result simply 1/3rd infections wild variants last year hospitals came limits again, due patiens younger usually surviving also longer ICUs often ending chronic problems afterwards! UK government set roadmap going well far. Certainly could vaccinated three people Rubbish freaking out. top safe entire year now. extremely isolated sacrificed lot. moved back city old friend reach out. agreed wear masks upon request got little drunk took masks certain point never put back on. hung girl night mask freaking next day. today find co-worker tested positive Covid working bar week.

I know probably survive it’s long term issues, especially ones given history anxiety, depression PTSD.

I pacing tripping multi day panic attack can’t get stop. feel like idiot making decision. much disparity due testing states compared ""other"" states, know mean. Joe Rogan top chart. sounds lot reasonable. Looks like health ministry thinks could 10% hospitalizations J&amp;J used. don’t think thing concluded yet J&amp;J yet go large scale, population wide trial like Pfizer done Israel. understand possibility, though data indicates J&amp;J less effective preventing hospitalizations vaccine. something different I’d love see it. 

Regarding lockdown, unfortunately sounds fairly accurate European situation. Perhaps Norway bit conservative here, there’s doubt behind. 

As main gripe, don’t know. haven’t seen paper suggests that. would certainly go conventional wisdom regarding vaccination immunity generally. Buddha? Hard keep track reincarnations. mf says long term couldnt wait month two vaccine rollouts trump literally done nothing said nothing regarding c19, would better shape are. No, guy Hope everyone staying safe pandemic. It’s tough us 🙁 probably better ventilator tube rammed throat whilst fed drip. Wow, great point. really equivalent illiterate. one executives forgot read, would keep onboard? Hmmm... 

If can’t keep up, get way give opportunity. Inspections like pretty standard drug application regulatory authorities, guess reports people might felt forced participate probably sped decision. also build trust vaccine Europeans others inspection turns without major/critical findings. better somebody, fault own, received COVID vaccine? surprised. kind thought pervasive sub. tried singing dancing mask on? “Many days” first dose March got infected 2 weeks. felt symptoms subside brain fog still lingers. couple 9-11's week. cares? Tachycardia isnt uncommon side effect many viral infections.

My wife ended pacemaker viral infection decade ago.

It drag good cardiologist options much better used be.

Good luck!  Although wouldn’t downvote someone dumb opinion like that, someone lives Arizona, mildly upsetting thing see. Ducey isn’t much disaster people would believe he’s FAR awesome. He’s pretty bad, especially last year. shit. else supposed live vicariously children? mask wreaking havoc skin no. would assume information changes nothing life? 30

I went crapton weight loss former morbid obesity I'm still (barely) 30.  ""War Terror"" watching Newsom Cuomo suffer reversals political fortune respective states, governors take great pains demonstrate going jump line, imho. Uh, we're going reach herd immunity like, June, current rate vaccination.

At point COVID pretty much die tiny pockets.

That's something. want go store requires vaccine passports, go store requires vaccine passports. really understand concern is. I'm old enough remember smoking non smoking sections airplanes lol. best modern analogy war, solders unwilling civilians. 

More tragic conditions:

Those conditions tend put within 3 weeks like this. Many mentioned long term events may influenced environment behavior. (Also, sometimes unlucky). flu, yearly, nearly much damage COVID19. 

 
Anyways.. getting back point money put it. Large sums NSF, NIH, HHS grants put research related curing preventing cancers, heart disease, preventing flu. Isn’t gov giving away loads countries well? It’s nice seems like take care Indian citizens first seems rather obvious: one set hard dates without risking disappointment. 

Without variants we'd humming along fine right now. new variant defeats vaccines would set everyone back 0. start calling Brazilian mass murder Bolsonaro effect? incompetent, evil degenerates directly responsible demise entire country. correlated strength effort recall him?? Australia, NZ, Europe, Vietnam, Thailand I'd bet lot popular tourist destinations. sub becoming irrelevant day lol think I’m unsubbing finally necessarily. vaccines extremely well designed attack main attack method virus.

Any changes method make virus unlikely attack humans. makes feel better, take comfort knowing lot probably paid shills. Concerts pretty much boat. I'm getting work 2022 projects now. haven’t heard health departments yet (besides you), read one apps connecting people surplus vaccines huge info harvester. Dude running given complete non-answer need info philanthropy. people take excuse. It’s weird. Glad got vaccinated without give specifics. can’t right. According NYT database state currently 50+ Michigan generally anything 10-15 considered high. Maybe mean 5 cases per 100,000? Anti-freedom governors preventing people freely running business way see fit good thing. anyone know possible allergic reaction 10 hours second vaccine?

I'm allergic quite lot food usually results breaking hives. never anaphylactic shock throat closed up. experiencing hives itchiness. ...and former NY/CT'er TX 2 decades, awesome. I'd never move back north, especially seen come states. Ok, new interesting SAR-Cov-2 variants around corner. Plus show work mask might send home sick without questioning you’re trying skip day. used work SE Asia took note many bicycle/moped/scooter riders wearing masks. However, fully grasp well 2 layer cloth mask kept street dust nose mouth started biking Covid, wearing 2-layer cloth masks. Plus, cloth masks great keeping sun rays nose/cheeks/chin. longer need wear greasy, eyeburning, face itching sunscreen bike riding. Secretly LOVING whole mask thing bike. w u always say ""D&amp;D players know low 95% is""...

But people involved vaccinated, get roll advantage. Perfect. really needed get us pandemic. Vaccines want them. Treatments still contract COVID-19. Win-win.  you’re comments read like stream consciousness poor punctuation difficult discern sentence structure hospitals literally overwhelmed mean people die... 
 
There 3 million people getting vaccinated day rate rising rapidly. trip finish line? We're going mostly done Covid month, finished two months. casual racism aside, Chinese border restrictions face outward, preventing people getting China easily, enforcing quarantine enter country. China restrict people leaving great extent, certainly barrier exporting future infectious vectors! govt officers shit blame public incompetency.

I agree masks work physical distancing also uk indian ppl generally behave.

They shld planned long ago widening gap watch us,uk possibly europian countries open fun start again.

Sucks country now. 8 weeks would lot quicker 22 weeks threw tho amounts EU gets delivered supposed increase till end Q3 UK actually gets supply problem decent chance EU catch up. Maybe pay funerals, regardless cause, screwing next kin financially they’re also grieving evil thing do.

Why society pay expensive coffins? mind government paying basic service, really, 9,000 lot money. dude posting daily videos beach night life Brazil it’s surprise. would walk hours video would see nothing endless masses people partying beach night life districts Kinda surprised got late. figured politicians would first dibs healthcare workers  got mine private pharmacy (not national chain). guess care. solid points. there's confirmation bias looming large here. people tend talk stuff goes bad. 10k people side effects go lives *one* person experiences side effects writes them, sense proportion completely skewed. 


all else aside though, even *every* vaccine resulted 3 days sweaty nauseousness fatigue, would still, 100% absolutely worth I'd first line.  stands, far everyone. nationwide crisis make difference? deaths tragic dying cancer heart disease flu? good friend died pancreatic cancer couple months ago. fault then? much B1526? NY, NJ, PA contiguous, there's lot back-and-forth travel NY/NJ FL. much money?

Call callous, personally care I'm cremated/buried die really see tax money go something cosmetic / support expensive funeral industry.

A quick websearch says cheapest cremations cost one two thousand. Can't subsidize cheapest option leave bill families want nice wood coffin prime graveyard spot loved ones? Yep. Pretty much goes. silly. There’s like 12 people here.  Anyone anti mask buy plane ticket Brazil enjoy freedom highest case rates country many rural states US past winter. Ireland allow youth sports start Monday...schools open time since August little issues took break Christmas covid cases went roof. School resuming phases since March 1st majority teen-agers retuning Monday... fun. Ohh, pretty interesting! Thanks! Lol what? You’re one suggested might happen.  I'd like think White House ""a moment clarity"" regarding personal liberties, (at least) two major US States (FL, TX) vowing enforce usage, bother now, least political standpoint? pressed now, states (and leaders) look like bastions freedom seemingly totalitarian act majority voters. could always revisit idea, spikes said states, may support time.

It’s really scary someone mention something definitely remember, recollection of. agree. I'm American headlines kind dramatic across board. It’s typos lol lot you’re saying borderline incoherent That's exactly works.
The efficacy percentage number vaccinated people got sick, rather number sick people vaccinated. 

Say 1000 vaccinated group 1000 control group.

If 152 control group got sick 8 vaccine group got sick, that's 160 people. 8÷160=.05=5%.
That's 95% efficacy, .8% vaccinated people getting sick vs. 16% control group.

These made numbers, course, remember actual ones, example efficacy works, big difference 5% vaccinated people get sick vs. 5% sick people vaccinated. tl;dr: haha vaccine manufacture go brrrrr Worse one honestly That's surprising considering one wears masks surely appreciate fact ""okayness"" subsidized military funerals directly contradicts everything saying, good day Yeah... school.

Right 13.2 million first dose. 375k per day would mean 9 million end month (split dose 1 2) need ramp quickly Newsom meant end *this* month. 

(edit: 2:00 video, say ""the end calendar month"") 

There article today said Moderna output double month.

[The LA graph shows average doses increased ~275k ~375k beginning March April pretty straight line could least 475k per day end month would 11.4 million doses end month 475k started tomorrow. sure people arguing you. make good points, seen repeatedly last year covid wreaks havoc body. pretty sure dealing effects still appointment go see psychologist.

So subtract people consider 'anxiety' 'mood disorders' long term COVID complications, left 3% people. I'm curious know sort long term complications remaining 3% experienced. know 9 people contracted COVID none long term complications. Homelander getting excited. not, stop insanity even lol. I’m even arguing you. You’re wasting time huge responses really saying anything. experience similar. knew boss wasn’t going help, called health department got without verification anything. asked address employer name though.

Yeah, threw used kn95 leaf blowing, normally walk back sneezing scratching eyes, today bitches, outsmarted dried leaves. feeling people wearing masks end May let alone mid-June after. Yea, effected *other people*. Reccomended, yes. 
Mandatory, no. Yes exactly, literally data have. likely last least year county announced tomorrow we're dropping red orange. county also said even close enough vaccine doses 50+. 15th everyone 16+ become eligible. There's also maskless fucks walking around supermarkets busy public establishments. Oh, how're tightening? Yep. That’s they’re willing guarantee least six months. Why, though?

Spending hour crowded subway car peak flu season seems lot high risk quick trip store 6 pm Tuesday, N95 mask would protect well others. Wasn’t intermediate animal? know animal was? narrow down?

Weird, right? vaccinated probably, although CDC want know since would encourage ton antivaxxers start saying ""vaccinated"". Eh? 

No one died immediately. One worker died cancer, probability cancer caused radiation less 1%.

Similarly, projections eventual cancer deaths due radiation exposure populace like, three.  horrific excuse. There’s tech requirement book events anyway! can’t figure use app show you’re vaccinated making booking, don’t get go. It’s simple. would possibly say that? lie vaccinated people wear masks. nothing significant stop COVID. people need wear masks stop COVID vaccinated. science, data.

Doesn’t discount statistic puts bit context saying “just 5 states!” Economy never closed. idiots write plastering ignorance. closed edge cases “people” felt would limit spread. economy ducking closed whole time.

No, allergic reaction would happen soon getting vaccine. probably ate something allergen it. certainly seems to. pray mercy,

The deeds mercy. Title misleading. global statistic. here. makes sense every adult wants vaccine vaccinated. happened yet, next months. CA definitely ridiculous restrictions end compared states - certain that. can’t certain economic damage do, amount people question whether want continue living there. Math hard? proper due process, sure. soloing it? AZ also given Austria young people, unlike countries moment, check polls many people says take (from memory, third) compared others. virtue. Yeah point isn’t entirely wrong it?

My grandfather died Cancer summer, pay funeral. could afford cremation life insurance. 

His death wasn’t listed COVID alone months nursing home *because* COVID. 

I don’t want reimbursed. think it’s unfair get angry poster making fair point - one type death eligible another not? possible virus become endemic yes, may want give annual covid vaccines alongside flu vaccines. people immunize, slower spread mutate. flu barely present humans year covid prevention measures limited flu (which less transmissible) well, unfortunately animal reservoirs flu continue mutate spread humans, also return. Actually, Newsom announced fully back normal June 15th. Sadly, narrative “extinguished”. think we’re going see (even bigger) exodus California insist ridiculous restrictions like mask mandates 50% capacity even risk extremely low.

Texas Florida looking tempting ever. Apparently poll showed vast majority Austrians would take it. seen Germany. Oh no. least brains young pretty plastic, hopefully recovers fully. Keeps bugs mouth too! 100M people compute or...

You’re truly shining example American education. Pffft. Centuries least carnival (february) parties

Thanks that. knew missing something, familiar Brazilian culture.

I truly hope Brazil gets control. high death count painful look at, even half world away. course No, reading don’t think that’s meant. I’ll tossing mine summer definitely nothing like flu... takes 5-10 days symptoms show, people go get tested, would expect see Easter holiday bump reflected case numbers? “Hopes” lmao I'm guessing Fauci's quotes also identified transmissible variants though? herd immunity threshold basically little math inverse quickly virus spread, virus spreads quickly, we'll need higher immunity threshold.  agree point, sometimes colds last week longer cough lingers weeks. don’t see employers wanting people take full week work mild cold. I'm like *suggesting* it, countries 3 well weening age. Right, which, cares? Oh no, hackers know took vaccine Good luck convincing people take without EMA oversight. absolutely trust Austrian government simplest task, let alone deciding vaccine own. Performing free market exchange another private person way privilege. alternatives available. turns risk vaccine greater 60 year old, wealthy countries would make sense use alternative. many poorer countries may option, AZ cheapest readily available moment.

In event, risk reward calculation settled. SNL reference? 🤔 I’m confused, playing Jeopardy something? Im even sure youre trying suggest here, ehat would consider appropriate action pandemic Well guy's right sure one thing. media virus without doubt. country's CDC released report plan lifting restrictions. According vaccines reduce risk severe desease symptomatic hospitalizations reduced 10% everyone vaccinated. say lockdown november restrictions wont lifted april next year. also recommended use J&amp;J low efficacy.

If true, bother vaccinating? new information vaccines says dont prevent severe illness symptomatic? RIP Carlin. saint needed, one asked for. Liar virus, however, something completely eradicated. We’ve done plenty times before.

Measles anti-vaxxers entered chat... Many society immunocompromised rely rest us vaccinate protect them. That’s reason enough patriotic American. come sometime! It’s great! black folks butchering streets bitching pissing moaning Black Lives Matter, two sides political parties stupid realize government doesn’t give shit either nobody knows born man woman anymore. It’s good times man don’t hate till youve tried. reason easy get shot vaccine hesitancy higher lot states. According Bloomberg vaccine tracker, Arizona, 32.3% people 1st shot 19.2% fully vaccinated. Compare nextdoor California given 1st shot 34.5% people fully vaccinated 18.3% people, comparable numbers. Yet California still hasnt opened 16-49 year olds Arizona has. So, despite fact Arizona opened eligibility everyone, still neck neck California, points fact lot hesitant people Arizona. Getting shot ""fucking easy"" theres lot idiots Arizona. Parliament? No. much things done first You’re free stay home wearing 3 masks, wish. need us live fear. I’m hoping wash hands restroom. weird one pre pandemic. went high school, know nobody read, better act like Maybe perspective someone three high risk people immediate life quarantined year. wearing mask able go insignificant compared. last fully vaccinated next week I'm planning going whatever again. asked wear mask couple months (it's summer yet maybe June it'll obvious need it) still able go things insignificant negative me.

Like really insanely selfish think wearing piece cloth face completely ruins enjoyment activity doing. like least anyone me. know sure we're good seems frankly short sighted complain it.

Like can't imagine going last year concerts masks. like 100 times better concerts? 

But like regardless April know store next two months. Maybe may it'll obvious start getting rid masks knows planning getting rid insufficient evidence winning move school (as people old enough take vaccine) like month half, even enough time vaccine card fully filled actually change much short term. Requiring one get enrolled school =/= app show anytime go building (an app proof stealing information). unsurprised Bakersfield dealing low vaccine demand. even so, cell culture tests worth much. point see results statistical significance actual people. Good baker. don’t think checked ID, insurance card. people without insurance.

Now mention it. agree. check stuff either. would know actually got shot? Maybe that's can't really mandate it. Hmm.  can't see issue app likely storing data scanned, long there, others places scanned at, part digital wallet places spent money at?

Yeah tech companies aps NEVER anything wrong data....

That even approaching issue equity. People can't get vaccine, people older use smart phones, people low income can't afford one. New York's numbers completely stonewalled like 2 months terms cases hospitalizations. there's still lot community spread despite vaccines.  Texas strictly require vaccination anything. get exemption long sort personal objection it. There's zero context anywhere country need show immunization regular basis order go public life. Whether agree not, think actual ideological position. rattled bunch claims vaccine companies, imply trusted way, enforce negative view vaccines general, pretty much textbook conspiracy theory stuff? mean, asked things conspiratorial, I'm telling you, yeah!  fair watched Fox News she'd take masks vaccines ""personal affront liberty"". suggest watch that's somewhere middle recklessness hysteria? question “we don’t know:” It’s hard definitive answers vaccines/vaccination studies, you’re working controlled field. You’re able measure efficacy effects dosage amount, aren’t wild swings variation severity like virus. Basically, it’s hard say amount — — immunity recovery offers. 

As whether get shot you’ve recovered virus... yes. Get it. CDC recommends gives verifiable, genuine protection. everything one size fits — I’m doctor, I’m 13 — I’d recommend getting jab you’ve recovered strong enough take minor side effects it’ll provide. May add: don’t listen fearmongering HIV vaccines. adenovirus heighten HIV susceptibility foreign vaccines aren’t won’t used US. digress. know anything digital behavior.  


Also. ""they're already it"" legitimate reason give access minimal benefit. Biggest irony anti-vaxxers old thanks vaccines. passport need carry go store pandemic?  people always come excuse. mandates effective people think are? consider steps don’t get enough people vaccinated. I’m crazy idea forcing anyone there's place people happily going barefoot last hundred years 

so argument Appeal **Tradition** type **logical fallacy** something accepted true better ""way always done."" evidence specific belief course action actually better. believed better **traditional** belief course action.

HIV completely different disease. got lucky COVID easy actually curious could perform simple google search. There’s huge number people wear masks everyday work, hobbies, protection bad air quality personal health reasons. would wonderful someone invented comfortable/reusable/easily made etc mask still highly protective didn’t break bank.

Most people don’t get flu often. Colds, entirely different story. LOT people there. many screwed.

If 130+ biotech companies working vaccines start pandemic, wondering 3 approved US far. risks going international - tax changes business registration requirements (like would see companies dealing even dealing different states) add different worker protection laws. Unless talking large company already presence, going global going easy folks think.

But, larger companies may find easy, math adds up. However, even I've seen businesses learn hard way low cost (sorry, ""high value"" called it) countries labor costs offset quality, performance, labor stability issues. Here's difference - restaurant, take mask meal. can't take shoes all. 

The mask prevents death destruction shoes, also taken off. guess “peak” still lower December surge? state immunization database. Mine (MN) updated within 2 weeks first dose. report also shows recommended vaccines (I’m due shingles). Belgium (and maybe also Netherlands), immunity currently estimated 40-50% (vaccination + previous infection). getting closer!! feel like might part it. Europeans posting definitely air smugness every time talked lockdown. Europe, whatever reasons, thought lockdowns endgame culture war bullshit. require immunization schools, immigration (like visa), etc. reason reason Florida it. Virtual signals base, culture war.

Second, even did, pharmacies aren’t collecting enough data fix spelling errors, disambiguate people name, whatever else would need able rely data passport project. see Goop selling it.  said need variants. say lift right now, think publicly planning to, setting dates.

I think May 1st good one. wskv...weed smoke kills virus Pfizer literally doesn’t need booster B1.135. approved is. 20m doses due arrive month. virus never overwhelm health system rates vaccination. one gotten pissy here. people agree idea domestic venues requiring proof vaccination can't argue merits belittling them. Yeah well, collective society get rid them, therefore society fine like this. can't fight hypersanitized society. said new variants. Everyone reads good news? read terrifyingly short lived. Yet South Africa one countries apparently driving develop booster could conceivably originally planned put something like production. frankly, real life data suggest it’s even necessary. haven’t made less expensive moves ensure it’s necessary - South African scientists specializing genomic sequencing know troubling E484K mutation (feel free believe it’s African country I’m used - quality South African scientists hardly difficult thing confirm Internet search) quickly tell whether they’d willing take vaccine current form (booster free) not. tests carried SA regarding real world efficacy Moderna haven’t involved point. Frankly, tiny team South African scientists hadn’t spent last year punching weight relentlessly sharing every speck data real time ASAP analysis, latest (despite put receiving end 121-country travel ban great economic cost), Moderna might receiving end results decidedly negative initial espoused efficacy rate little idea why. least good someone else pulled finger figured out. 

Is true efficacy booster going established Seattle grain truth? US multiple circulating variables whilst South Africa doesn’t. has, dominant strain, variant booster targeting. it’s anything like Novavax trial, could even see whether vaccination could prevent reinfection B1.135 infection original strain (spoiler: NVX, didn’t).

We don’t want need Moderna stage within foreseeable future, *touch wood* may cost earth, best results booster would surely involve exposing greatest concentration B1.135, undoubtedly SA. might look worse (ito efficacy rate) Seattle trial, potentially, would conclusively. doubt we’d want anything since don’t necessarily need right now.

Given founding constitutional principle “I are”, problem Moderna vaccine general (the country mean) - we’re fairly sure booster isn’t needed avoid severe infections, death hospitalisations (even quoted price per dose equal two kidneys black market /s) still regard one three vaccinations suitable immediate use SA original formulation despite one yet formally approved.

And still small amount population vaccinated. ~20% enough yet.m. Though seems least good enough right loosen restrictions. We're way though, end sight imo there's need rush every thing could masks safely.

If you’re going complain AZ delivering doses, calling export block aren’t AZ produced doses UK also sent also referred export block? Read article, EU asked AZ apply export licence 3M doses. EU commission speaking truth intend block export mistake made new application made summarily approved. Commission actually rejecting accepting applications definition blocking export.

Now may (probably) case AZ cannot supply order anyway. so, them, right totally within remit commission clear confusion. weird brains interpret numbers.

They're currently experiencing third wave. No. fact [hospitalization rates people 70 going people full immunized. rate vaccination 40-60 years old still quite low priority groups. Middle age adults ones filling hospitals, trend seen before, happening also countries.

By far common diagnoses 33.62% group anxiety disorder (17.39% overall, 7.11% first diagnosis) mood disorder (13.66% overall, 4.22% first diagnosis). Substance use disorder insomnia diagnoses, even quite rare first diagnoses. 

For neurological conditions (intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, myoneural junction muscle disease) increase risk significantly compared flu respiratory tract illnesses. However, overall incidence low, usually &lt;1%. study explicitly analyse this, seem much common hospitalized ICU patients, whereas anxiety mood disorders difference smaller (non-hospitalized first anxiety 6.81% compared ICU first anxiety 9.79%, example). 

So me, take-home message two-fold: mood, anxiety, sleep problems reasonable common patients, especially continuing suffered issues covid. New serious neurological conditions quite rare, mostly focused hospitalized ICU patients. think arent faking numbers, dont get wrong.

I know CT, example, nothing reported Saturday Sunday, Mondays numbers include data 3 days. lol nice? political party directly responsible 500,000 dead Americans. Niceties over. see fiction Superman want eat Lois' butt, puts kryptonite food. finds he's like 'quick where's anti-kryptonite??' stands up, turns around, lifts skirt spreads cheeks says 'riiight here' laced butthole last remaining anti-kryptonite.

Edit: Okay fine is

So comic book #321 Superman's finishes eating Lois Lane's ass, General Zod , Faora-Ul, Quex-Ul attack, superman springs action. beats easily.. easily. finds outs eating ass gives super duper powers beyond current powers. Lois Lane pretended that's trying get Superman whole time. Though since he's Superman need extra powers forgets it. every often super villain that's stronger superman comes eat Lois Lane's butt power enough beat them.

In comic book #486, Wonder Woman Superman Space super powerful villain knocks Superman unconscious. luckily Wonder Woman grabs Superman escapes fortress. Super villain closing them. Somehow Wonder Woman signals earth contacts Lois Lane, Lois Lane hearing situation, pleads Wonder Woman take Superman's tongue. Wonder Woman does, Lois Lane says 'Great, pull blue underwear sit face'. Wonder Woman like 'wtf' Lois Lane like 'THERE'S TIME EXPLAIN'. Wonder Woman so, butthole induces extra powers. He's still unconscious tongue starts stir Wonder Woman makes face . ass eaten before, none tongues could apply pressure like super tongues .

When SuperMan regains consciousness he's like 'wtf', Wonder Woman like 'Lois Lane told me'. there's time that, super villain here, SuperMan defeats new powers. time easy, even butthole powers. turns since Wonder Woman's butthole, powers Wonder Butthole augmented.

A similar situation happened Supergirl Superman comic book #531. Mera Superman comic book #589.

In Comic book #656 Mera, Supergirl, Wonder Woman hanging talking sex, find best ass eating ever Superman, tongue could apply super pressure. get experience super duper villain appears that's powerful superman. That's idea. go Brainiacs liar, let DNA make Supervillian. Brainiac asks this, answer.

They create Super villain unleash him. Mera, Supergirl, Wonder Woman make way Superman, realized decide gets ass eaten. start fighting whose entitled it. Superman makes way finds fighting. He's like 'please, need meta-ass, meta-ass'. 3 girls let Superman decide. Superman's thinking, Wonder Woman pulls sweaty n slimy blue underpants spreads cheeks says 'yes, pick whatever want' winking butthole Superman.

This sneaky ploy part Wonder Woman, fat, muscular cheeks pretty butthole winking Superman, advantage. Superwoman Mera same.

Superman see's tension. uses super speed give three simultaneous eats eatings. he's done, he's ready fight superman. Wonder Woman like 'uh Superman?'. points crotch. Since he's ate 3 meta asses, gained 9x powers, new suit designed constrain Super boners ass eating designed handle pressure 9x boner.

His superboner silenced everyone awkward silence. Superman thought would wait minutes reside going villian 3 woman's eyes like invisible hands stroking cock. strength, pressure, erection quickly pulled away waist. cock started pull up, wanting stand straight rather forced side.The girls watched transfixed saw movement briefs. like alive, trying escape tight confines, soon head beast appeared top, coming full view. eyes widened sight. bulbous, red, engorged. edge, past elastic, shaft quickly slid straight, boldly climbing pushing waistband.""Wow,"" Mera said quietly, speaking them, naked, stiff cock jutting body. indeed impressive demonstration force hard 9x cock.

Meanwhile Brainiac watching whole thing satellite like 'wtf'.

""However imperfect—and slow—Canada’s rollout been, Picard experts suggest envious Canadians looking toward U.S.’s speedy vaccination rollout consider Canada slow. “I think, Canada, we’ve obsessed lot gets vaccinated order, think, U.S., it’s much ‘Just let ’er rip’—you know, vaccinate whoever: get arm, stick needle it. Canadian very, cautious this, think slowed rollout,” Picard said.

“But don’t think that’s bad thing,” continued. “I think it’s worth giving thought trying fairly.”

Tim Evans, COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, says centralized, deliberate approach vaccine distribution allows equitable access. immunization committee’s “were very, clear,” Evans says. “One: institutionalized elderly population, older people group, particular attention disadvantaged communities, racialized minorities, Indigenous people.” think user said restrictions lifted every person chance fully vaccinated.

Sucks bad y’alls thoughts chances getting it? said “herd immunity” way comments lmao wtf happened sub Dude Quebec still full red zone lockdown Legault upped measures literally hours ago. also stated covid cases rise exponentially within couple days (which I'm sure will), back fucking 8pm curfew. they're still vaccinating 60 older, fuck rest, right? Idiots. really. Canada outpacing many EU countries doses per day around 25%. 

 vaccine bets paying took significant number large shipments week next 2 weeks also huge numbers incoming. 15 days Canada 15 million doses hand 38 million population. 

With 1st dose decision put Canada roughly 35% population least one dose. Though get see fast provinces get doses arms. mom got second shot yesterday. Dad got first shot today.

They also seem think bet unknown vaccines create 40-80 million vaccines doses year creating entire industry scratch. Well that's fair, rubbing sticks together that's I'm trying portray it. 25 miles away rural town 25k people wayyyyyy different 25 miles well populated area. like job like work situation moment. change it, I’ll start looking. problem people care potential risks, surely care mitigations.

The real problem science early cases still really there. lot rules made facts known. people world complaining changing guidelines moving goalposts, easier policy makers leave us already place along.

Surface cleaning big example. Early, made great sense pandemic. Now? Still bad idea risk fomite spreading shown 1/10k touching contaminated surface. policy updated? No. know right, I’m scared...oooooooo variants. overblown flu virus 98-99% survival rate. Hybrid schedules cop-out red herring. genie bottle. I'm never going back office. think lot traditional companies going learn hard way companies poach employees offers remote work. Remote work without downsides tradeoffs, companies demand everyone come office acting like nothing changed, pay price. Especially Silicon Valley, Los Angeles real estate prices, rent, commuting time HUGE factors choosing job. one's going know whether vaccinated looking you, would uproar attendants business owners demanded see type vaccine receipt, could simply denied service wearing mask Cyclosporine certainly without risks. Wear something doesn’t several layers. cold days got shots, wore shirt + dress + cardigan. Felt like stripper trying undress pharmacist lol lol fair enough, hope sake get back office soon! hate WFH. want go back office full-time, socialization aspect. find many distractions home, like keep work home completely separate. realize I’m minority, fully support coworkers working home. me, office works better. He’s right he’s shitty manager. 

He’s telling he’ll do. Agreed. want wfh fully either. I'm thinking something like 1 day consistently another 1-2 needed. would love keep working home

Not that, job looking real option!

 Also, times want us work, we'd shared desk could go to, log in, boom! stuff ready go.

Plus do, physically required. Find 🇨🇳😷📱&amp;🔪👼☯️🤖 here. gotten increasingly expensive live near city work in, I've slowly pushed range years able call commuter rail pass affordable anymore. $400/month plus ~$125/month parking. Going back work office absolutely going make cry. sorry misunderstanding !
it rate thrombose low platelets Norway AZ-vaccinated people:
*Norway, administered AstraZeneca vaccine 130,000 people age 65, reported five patients low platelets, hemorrhage, widespread thromboses, three died. That’s one case 25,000 vaccinees, “a high number critical outcome previously healthy, young individuals,” think even catholic church using J&amp;J options available. take J&amp;J one options available you. think brilliant idea. many people going go out, get one free, buy one, two, three, four... sucks. I've fully vaccinated since early March live hour border, I've aching Montreal day trip. almost three years I've lived first two taken grad school, finally sane work schedule still can't it. I've several times life cool city. Wahhhhhh. Wahhhhhhhh I've seen compelling data. need photos. Patients hospital peaked 40,000 context 60,000,000 people 40,000 hospital small amount. 

See here: ""Between Q1 2010/11 Q4 2019/20, *total* number *NHS hospital beds* decreased 11% 144,455 Nope I’m one choosing picking data points fit narrative. That's lack hospital capacity real thing. almost kind real thing early pandemic places (Italy kind New York), that's it.

How know this?

Because states prepared supplement capacity tore way, way end pandemic. Illinois spent $66 MILLION turning Chicago's convention center (the largest country mind you) field hospital late March/early April. temporary hospital served total 38 patients. That's $1.7 MILLION PER PATIENT scoring home.

By early May, last patient released facility dismantled. That's right, despite fact facility going used conventions anyway, got rid beds. October/November second wave hit, power gall point lack hospital beds reason lockdown.

IF CONCERNED HOSPITAL CAPACITY, FUCK TEAR TEMPORARY HOSPITAL SPENT $66 MILLION BUILDING 8 MONTHS AGO!?!?! Keep taking states tiny standard deduction then. Ignorance bliss guess YORK CITY — Empire State still led nation coronavirus cases last week, despite falling numbers New York City troubling surges elsewhere. need go school that? /r/usernamechecksout  there? Seriously asking, love Montreal can’t see going every year Web/mobile app startup industry. much sun many mass gatherings Screw commute. moved NYC area 10 years ago never give 2+ hours life day traffic again. blacklisted temp work previous place put refused pay hiring full time. 


Not sure blacklisted *ME* instead company. whatever lol. truly hope open floor plans die painful death. deal 4 5 times year trips main office, possibly get anything done environment. seems understand racism actually works real world. Bias, conscious unconscious, built culture. Multiple studies shown time BBIPOC folks discriminated sciences medicine. they're women queer.

But then, appears truth hard you, along consensus reality. starlink coercing marginalized economically vulnerable people seek high-risk employment.

The state forces premature reopening tourist consumer economies, ""creating"" bunch high-risk customer-facing jobs, jobs shut high-risk. People depend unemployment benefits required seek jobs risk losing little offered stay afloat. Rates unemployment unequally distributed race level education, see states forcing already marginalized population high-risk work order reopen TOURIST CONSUMER economies. 

Yes, definitely people ""leaching"" system. them. setting straight, teaching lesson, that. protecting people actually depend system. teachers

This mean much steaming pot unvaccinated children. even little bit accurate. Tax software (which vast majority population use) incorrectly giving standard deduction 90% population. Imagine difference dying getting flu like symptoms several thousands people reason call meme vaccine

You guys understand 3rd world. remain option millions people several years.

I'd rather get survive, later possible get better vaccine paying pocket complaining find interesting vaccine disease known cause clotting also linked clots. possible something people's antibody reaction causing clots? would interesting know people end clots receiving vaccine would also developed clots contracting virus anyway. lot people spread bs turn profit. think getting views/ad revenue, selling bs supplements “wellness” stuff  headlines WFH fucking stupid. First all, people can't. can't WFH working grocery store mechanic. people even care ""entitled class"" computer programmers corporate HQ managers already make $100K year average. 

Fuck people.

Also, current ""success"" WFH PR bullshit. massive negative impact businesses across country. basically trying ride wave in-office relationships teams built pandemic. time passes, teams go office/virtual built virtual world, see every CEO talking co-location proximity like pandemic, consolidation happen elsewhere.

In meantime, assholes keep saying quit. Please that. create openings other, less entitled people, struggling work mind going office get job. strains ""around"" since last summer, took many months overtake classic strain even locally. Slowing spread high value, places stopping covid spread (with either vaccinations costly lockdown) can't stopped entirely.  Fucking thank you!

All people itching go back office due lack social interactions seem forgotten it’s due pandemic work home.

Once pandemic over, extra time saved get ready go office commute, used social interactions. I'm doordash driver dropping front step half job. lot time spent bunched delivery drivers customers waiting food waiting seated restaurants doordash send ready else new? see lot people complaining commute work. News flash, one forced accept employment company. 
Don’t play victim circumstances voluntarily agreed too. angry. Beyond words  running hybrid schedule years. work mostly home, go office twice week meetings, face face meetings, relationship building, collaboration. establish deliverables target dates, go away work them. minimize wasted time associated time vampires office. excellent. 

Unfortunately, lockdowns imposed COVID undermined relationship building collaboration. working home many disadvantages too. Balance key. guess probably expected someone username ""AgorophobicSpaceman""  Yea work need office space field crews equipment, place bring clients, face face meetings literally one (of many) carrots stick offer people get vaccinated. 

We things things good otherwise do. Funny thing, quit already cause need break. I'm group. company announced plans yet, tell us going back 100% in-office... 

Well, 34% like me, find another comparable job WFH, switch employers faster Flash hopped speed.  cherry picking part. No, rn home office, im always office, that's problem lot commenters prefer social interactions come work want make friends there. It’s weird love office chit chat basically gone, I’m paid make friends. would much rather get social interactions work chose people spending time with. people guess lonely. I’m sad lol. Yeah probably 15-20yrs ago now, even back provide vaccine info local State University could enroll classes. company (IT / Cloud Provider) giving us option. still zero discussion returning anytime soon. eventually return hybrid, stay remote full time return full time. 

I personally go week probably Monday bulk meetings are. also told never required return office full time unless lack performance dictates that. 400+ working 100% remote since March 2020. Germans notorious opening windows ventilation weather. Maybe need adapt rely conditioning much. Hard many officer buildings, thought. betcha, honey! That's sad outlook whole situation man outdoor transmissions low hard trace? both? That’s called cherry picking. in: people don’t want go outside crossing border times since last year back forth, I'm Canadian living US. smells like LIRR hahah previous life middle ground flexible options WFH mixed office use it’s possible. best thing small medium sized outfits eliminate office rent create co-work spaces used 1-2 times per week team together person scrum meetings, employees want option work office rather home. 

People act like *everyone* wants WFH. It’s personal nightmare that. can’t focus worth garbage home, 90% remote I’d rather be. matter employee employer need flexible need look outside box options traditional office environment like co-working spaces partial WFH options. can't conveyed effectively videocall? Yes, somehow US literally hell nobody wears masks also many people wear masks  Felt little Pfizer doses, tylenol fixed that. Really sore arm dose 2, nothing else besides that. Consider lucky. Sweden 2nd worst region, right behind Lithuania. 
There denying that. thing unskilled labor. *shocked picachu face* $100 buys unlimited CTA pass

for 30 days. 


So that's $100 month. Yes. Tank top obviously 💪  lol middle management needing micromanage pretend anything useful “I believe it’s hate crime population affects big” little interested people's buttplug purchases bud. interestingly French less Germans British people. gotta kidding me. really think President United States democratic house senate worries technicality contract? Really? believe this? President wants ship others countries Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J refusing? 0 chance 25% attendance Must wear mask times outside seat. Must wear mask times seated, unless actively eating drinking.

I went Cubs spring training game last week rules applied. *At best* 25% people wore masks sitting seats. watched one guy wait til usher started back row took sip beer staring right usher... every inning. Another group guys claimed eating sunflower seeds usher told put masks on. people front us never even bothered wear masks, even fake eating/drinking. loophole, people exploit it. watched lady doctor's office couple weeks ago slowly eat entire breakfast waiting room bothered mask. Maybe strong immune system strong reaction first shot. got first Pfizer shot yesterday severe fatigue 3-12 hours shot. Felt like could barely get bed. Today, mid-back sore, sure it’s related. 

From I’ve heard, pain relievers like Tylenol Advil relieve vaccine symptoms pretty quickly (but may also reduce efficacy). second shot, I’m going try endure much can, gets uncomfortable, I’ll tap pop couple Advil Currently engineering major. told online courses weren’t possible engineering like majors. Turns lied managed within weeks. We’ve also seen higher pass rate harder classes. point prevent breath going out. reduction spreaders. don’t know carrying it. 

It’s intended block covid block spreading work (Networking) stuff like Ansible AI even gunning job. typical psychical labor jobs getting replaced Robots/AI 2020's. Cases declining here, guy Jesse Kelley, another blue check twitter According Bloomberg we've hit 704M worldwide doses!

Days from:

0-100M: 49 days

100-200M: 19 days

200-300M: 15 days

300-400M: 11 days

400-500M: 8 days

500-600M: 7 days

600-700M: 6 days!

Definitely gonna hit Billion worldwide month, could see 100M every 5 days though doubt get lower April May.  wishing office I’m severely depressed lonely. Tbh think would love remote work could see friends family like regular though.

It's age technology, friend. countless ways stay touch friends family days; everything group text group video chat. might take little effort get people set up, awesome able pop say hi Gram video call, especially past year Covid see normally. Unions fucking amazing everyone one Meat prices going wouldn’t bad thing Burden proof guy. working finance/trading bit difficult long-term WFH. I'm going need buy UPS systems ensure electricity multiple internet providers cell service providers. also store backup computers, mice, keyboards, monitors. Sure, that's big I’m expert, couldn’t companies save ton building rents job done remotely? 

Does figure equation all? (I don’t know shit corporations). know that's fair. people genuinely work better office want avoid assumed household responsibilities attached wfh. everyone ""home office"" people made using dining table living room genuinely looking return.  church bad? I'm mistaken 1 2 banks done this, however due pandemic every single bank offers service metric whether ""needed"" seems irrelevant me. vaccinations high public health value measure dollars. covid vaccines value hundreds thousands dollars per person. government really paying much everyone get vaccinated. job Sam Adams, promotions involving free stuff done companies time usually make money them. job better couch, going stir crazy lack social interactions.

Here's I'm at, **zero** desire fill need work. Let WFH 100% time, comedy clubs live music things like open would amazing. trimmed quarter pound homegrown weed boxers bullshit 3 hour hands call yesterday. 

Yeah I’m going back office. Ugggg. Keep strong, Brazil.  I've scanning checks mobile app years.. Oh yeah, there's ""nothing else do"" recent point forced something else  maybe us young people 'spouse/kids' yet relish thought actually getting back real world see people again?

You cannot replace face face contact. Band, theater, etc still allowed many places sports currently happening. cheaper beer. Thanks. went well.  one's going know whether vaccinated looking you

That matter everyone wants vaccine gotten one. Yep. There’s good chunk people get social interaction work shows. 

It’s really unhealthy. company poll like last fall. number people wanted remain entirely mostly working home *96%*.

I'm sure aided fact earlier last year, office moved large building, plenty room, downtown area, hub local public transportation, small building, packed like sardines, office park well outside city public transportation route.

Happily remote August year, probably kind hybrid set want need office. CEO given several interviews various industry publications bragging well transitioned almost WFH options almost complete WFH. somebody please call regarding getting second dose four weeks apart instead three weeks Pfizer Walgreens Stateside we’ve technology, least since recall like....my Samsung Galaxy 2. guys got retail banking apps? Given average recruiter comission 10-20% first years pay (depending location, industry, etc) they're still saving money making current employees happy. Win-win.

 $100 would slap face ever heard place called Florida? us. CEO travels Africa, long it’s roughly timezone got reliable Internet, one cares anymore get exact mechanism know. random. way certain women susceptible blood clots contraceptive pill likely need understand more. reply: could nothing.

Then keep additional duties. won’t go back
They can’t make  don’t right deny service based thing ask personal life.

If it’s protected class, sure do. Vaccination status isn’t protected class Unsurprising. working home 5 years now, offer elsewhere offered 20% raise, turned valued flexibility vs. commute ~10 hours week Good luck new biz! apparently guy Twitter claimed reason vaccines distributed sooner make trump look bad.

Anyone wanna prove/disprove this? Look Isreal, seeing substantial decline vaccination rates 50%. 

We lock get 85%. everyone opportunity vaccine open happen soon. want one that's problem, mine.  post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* yeah that's almost certainly it. nurses absolute wizards needles somehow stab piece metal without ever feeling thing. 
 
Given scale vaccine rollouts, probably lot people less experienced and... definitely can't that. Corn subsidized reasons outside direct human consumption. also makes 90+% feedstock. production drops price goes up, would trickle anything cattle, poultry, hog related too. well anything uses fertilizers animals produce. Keeping corn stable affordable benefits ton agriculture markets. Would curious see actual risk analysis this. Risk car crash, dying covid &amp; vaccine side effects younger population might really similar area. office job well would love stay home day two office week, sadly think job requires cooperation team make us go back full time. Nobody said good vaccines?

They've already stated age groups benefits offered vaccine weigh potential risks (and slim risk) 30s much finer narrow balance thus thats age bracket chose. USA friends outside work? it’s contractual issue keeping government allowed resell donate can’t renegotiate contract. parties agree isn’t hard change contract. AZ worried money US government donates doses bought countries donated won’t buy later? Saw state ( Georgia ) getting $96 million help vaccinations. thought state bought $96 million state lottery scratch-off tickets gave every vaccination Georgia would leading country vaccination rate.

Bonus would money would go back education funding :) I've worked home 3 days 2 office nearly 3 years due personal circumstances tbh found arrangement make everyone come talk million things see person. However, think sort arrangement people want now. days grind get work done peppered couple days office discuss projects, team bonding, site work etc. think best future us probably fluid office/WfH model. US major vaccine producer exporting vaccines. Calling now. NY cases fall least 50% end month. Wayyyy much natural infection + vaccination point expect otherwise. Yea corpos threaten actually fired/have quit probably happen year two, eventually forced back 9-5 office work * AstraZeneca promised delivers
* Sanofi-GSK never showed up
* Moderna J&amp;J build new production outside US
* CureVac seems waiting BBQ season start deliveries
* might get Novavax Valneva Christmas

At moment, BioNTech/Pfizer running show nearly alone.  company use sort voice video chat? used work remote got cybersecurity industry discord channel something similar people work thousand times better deal people person opinion. productivity skyrockets working home deal stupid questions, actually pay attention meetings managers set justify existence, listen Molly talk weekend plans 30 minutes I'm trying set DR test one biggest customers.

While get social interaction part work, personally want get work done get home hang out/talk people actually like instead maintaining supeficial relationship, pretending care random employee 47's cat last night. really happens lowering income pay electricity, heating etc. probably need refurbish often. yes.. prefer remote work also Good luck! helps work required hours. Start 8, finish 5, thats it. go get covid enjoy leaky blood vessels glassy lungs, honest people made rethink stance universal healthcare want subsidizing medical care going require years line uk starting 95% confidence, much better places Vaccine passports something sorts, they've done international travel. Serbia's vaccination rate 22%? UK 50% opened vaccination program everybody yet. Yeah follow tweet incredibly important. Many countries “high” category AZ absolutely beneficial 30s Yeah miss free food catering office would pre pandemic cant find anywhere new?

Edit. Nvm found it, definitely seen though. Weird Unfortunately becomes choice reality becomes individual manager. you, like me, get stuck working butts seats manager don’t choice. It’s even challenging majority company remote long pandemic, even similar teams based location, yet team return office.  

My boss toddler wife baby way due summer wants get house. go back too. issue comes unlimited vacation policies - teams get use great managers managers heavily frown upon taking time off. Since there’s “use lose it” policy feel guilty taking time off. Found parasitic millennial gender study degree, student loan debt, still lives Mom Dad.

Must suck you. full moon looking fierce! Good. I'm studying working time WFH improved life. sleep, eat study better. work call center, site can't go bathroom without asking supervisor, that's horrendous. 'hospital' analogy vaccines - hardly half complete.  comes goes waves. NJ/NY/etc also came low cases too. Spread disease clearly correlated population density. 1 100k, assuming roughly 20% death rate clots hold death rate would 1 every 500k people? I'll tell one thing.. going home work, breaks whenever need them.. guilty beer two meeting even.. getting back 5x week office 40+ hours rough. I'm appreciative place work means many fortunate, true transitioning back tough Yeah, uk one lowest rates Europe, 10x Lower France Germany, see risk benefit calculation changes massively cross channel mean, small apartment problem, working remote. move somewhere cheaper larger apartments. there's pandemic on, there's always coworking spaces. point several states using 90% versus states using 60-70% still receiving amount doses.

THIS. Vaccines good sitting shelf somewhere. I'll honest -- slightly 30 I'm rather peeved. okay take risk it, overall risk higher, even though alternatives less risks available? 50% people, 50% adults? still going opt wait another option..Canada options ordered. like AZ choice. experience get half work done quarter price American. works well bottom-line even need hire 2 offshore resources. UK’s MHRA news conference said enough second doses given yet make determination question. far, clots haven’t occurred second doses, they’re keeping eye it. Really? Ad-hominem attacks? 

I'm neither mean lonely, get first real job looking good suit flirting gal interviewing me. 

God forbid step entitled world see universe though someone else's eyes. ever serious compliance “lock down” anywhere US beyond March 2020? Feels like best talked 60% population wearing masks went day day life. depends environment. I’m comfortable working home since live home spacious area call office. stuck apartment day would completely different story. much. lived place 30 years. friends went elementary school with, another significant portion met college located hometown.

5 months pandemic, packed moved 10 hours away work leaving behind everyone everything I'd ever known. Making new friends new city mid 30s tough. workplace godsend, actually looked forward going office every day meet new people turn people inviting things. great. Now, faded away connections fully strong time shut we've gradually lost touch. I'm stuck small apartment big city lonely routine over. can't wait office open damn human interaction. Let's make deal — I'll let know drop dead taking grade-A Chineseum. meantime, I've got saved I'll drop PM see anything another vaccination foreigners. husband loves remote work... since first job. refuse work office. get less benefit wages etc happy. spend time together need one car etc worth it. companies offered lot pay etc refuse lol 😂 measles heard immunity general public long time yet communities lot anti-vaxers seen less continuous measles outbreak. seems measles fully eradicated covid. expect covid stay spreading certain populations refuse covid vaccine population vaccination rate needed herd immunity subgroup, even total population average would enough vaccinations herd immunity? Exactly saw measles past. Congrats! bet ass. Huge money-maker, especially Middle Eastern airlines flying Dubai even Qatar. 380 going aware anytime soon - crazy suites best ads money buy, all, people buy seat flight brag friends internet - free marketing. happening last 15 years already. Cases per 100,000 people. stopped wearing one outside streets Manhattan haven’t gotten word. I’m fully vaccinated continue wear one outside.

If someone says something simply
Ignore keep walking never heard them. 2024? depends bad wound right? left 'untreated', Covid would serious threat society (see Brazil). one knows don’t worry, it’s safe relative risk Covid people age group go ahead roll dice :) they’re dying covid what’s problem /s said ain’t enough data many second doses done, assume believe shouldn’t issue, say I’ve first curious happen future ""medical establishment""?

Who talking about? Nurses doctors ICU's trying tackle third wave Europe?

They establishment sense politicians serving lobbyists also overly negative. Get corrosive talking points, serving point ranting necessary measures pandemic mitigation.

Bolsonaro henchmen spearpoint reactionary thinking painting pandemic something negligible. What’s point posting story  Yes, fucked vaccines contracts. Absolutely question. want now? Go back time change contracts? Tell me, see solution ""actually vaccinate people"" right now? 

Just clear, I'm definitly CDU-supporter, ""just vaccinate people"" easy say without providing method that. Probably it’s already posted. search new posted bit one was. assume risk even lower second time around people issue first time around (in way someone allergic reaction first time, they're unlikely one second time around). fwiw san francisco avoided major outbreak throughout pandemic. country ranks 7th lowest cases per capita state, right around rate population density centers siskiyou, sierra, humbolt counties. 

considering second dense city country, theyre doin something right. reason give timeline lifting mask mandates move goalposts keep us masks, done several times far. Likely next reason keep us masks children vaccinated pets reasons fair, free food employer usually excuse compensate less, go get youre worth friend! Good you. everyone ""feels like"" get work done cubicle surrounded distracting coworkers want chat. Respectfully, risk dying covid actually still much greater that’s consider long covid risk around you. two jobs pre-pandemic left in-person job early go full time job (which always WFH). left in-person job sure I'd go back month two now, year in, can't ever see going back in-person job. thing miss socializing I'm fully vaxed things open I'm sure I'll fine. mean I'd rather spend time friends coworkers customers.  nice see data one table, though I'm bit disappointed allergic reactions included well. People moving protest sitting beside tens thousands people inch away hours boss said something yesterday meeting adding office space anyone wanted return. Crickets lol. sure miss commute all. Well reddit, instead working, happen shared office space I'd much rather in. working well all.  scared covid, stay home. Instead forcing bullshit vaccine passports onto others.

You stay home, I'm already vaxxed bruh Throughout day 9-5? know everyone's different, think wanting see anyone 9-5, 5 days week bit fucking grim.

And active social life outside sad see get saying, even though could probably walk door right find 10 passersby would gladly take 16 years Merkel's rule whatever here. Yet, something definitely rotten state Denmark Serbia handled nonsense better Germany. doctors also aware symptoms look cases treatment available fatality rate drop even Perhaps jobs dominate lot time, would time make friends similar interests. Jobs good attracting people similar interests, even way gathering interacting otherwise? options available, see jobs desirable source interactions. I'm reading 961? Which, granted, much lower. minorities Don’t forget Netherlands defining different rates covid circulation? think misunderstanding. J&amp;J initially confirmed quarter targets EU countries certain countries took quarter target divided three get idea much would get per month. happened Norway government said delivery April loved assumed, J&amp;J never confirmed anything recently.

Or source J&amp;J made massive promise April Denmark? Lol work well Trump elected? rust belt called rust belt reason. silicon valley shaped rust belt emerge. Sounds good businesses start expect 8-6 work day commute anymore lower salary need live city anymore. started remote year love it. everyone I've talked it. I'd want occur week team meetings I'd see us going back working one day(team meeting) 4 days home. thats nice hear city green zones everyone long commute. live 5 minutes office, gym, cafe, lots amenities home job create infrastructure

No no, infrastructure roads bridges. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

...../s, guess, probably required here. would awesome husband's company hybrid. way help drop kids school, pick extra shifts (I work retail). nobody get bunch work done commute? I'm software developer too, I'm sort you. hybrid model would great. 2-3 days per week each. Preferably would optional, could sometimes, less sometimes. 

I always feel know work much efficiently home. there's need collaboration, difficult beat real life. actually getting know onboarding new employees extremely challenging. Same. moved pretty far outside city ... commmuting 2+ hours day young kiddo home ... _really_ want avoid that. Sounds like putting much effort get know people. imagine much money companies saving pay office space. Plus workers still getting everything done efficient way what's problem letting folks continue work remotely? Thanks lot.

The EU plan exclude non western vaccines vaccine passport, questionable feasible, least two european union countries plus San Marino using them. lot disagreement plan carried out. think small chance barred entering chinese vaccine. I'm one think people get Covid crowded events like real losers. europe? sure hell case country also Europe. Vaccination GP doctors start April 12th, heard.
I asked doctor said receive 20 doses PER WEEK.

What fuck about???

I'm trying get vaccinated weeks now, chance. Ultimately, though really land shortage. Second doses given people first early Jan, sample size must rather small sound mean lonely makes sense Norway though. guys barely Covid afford wait vaccines available. places hundreds daily deaths situation totally different lot people asking things go back normal, I'd like ask think ever will. think need consider long-term changes everyday life? permanent changes, any, would recommend? likely would implemented accepted? fuck still going cruises? Can’t think worse vacation different type effort required make friends virtual office opposed physical one. fairly quick, got shot around 130. Sore arm instantly, nurse kind heavy handed. around 8pm fever kicked like lightswitch. 6am gone. top able household chores day, favorite thing wfh also use time decompress. want take break working, go take nap watch tv hour.  
  
It makes work feel relaxed much less like less grind get day get 4pm go home. I've finally started get 6 year old yoga 3 year old takes opportunity anyone floor basically reenact WWE everyone. 🤦 think that's good way increase morale lower turnover. give people options.

want come office five days week? fine.

want hybrid model WFH maybe 2-3 days week? that's fine too.

want WFH time? that's fine too.

I think giving people choice help workers out. nobody forced pick one other. resentment people feel forced. I’m certain, I’m going test out. XD quote article someone else posted.... ""Reactogenicity substantially greater second dose vaccines, particularly systemic reactions, including fatigue (53.9%), headache (46.7%), myalgia (44.0%), chills (31.3%), fever (29.5%), joint pain (25.6%)."" 

It's inevitable, big enough chance, people *should* preparing. thought enough ahead make sure work (Spring Break), think buy prepare easy food buy Gatorade. really eat yesterday, dumb part &amp; probably still feel like shit today. really sleep first night, made last night. I'm weak feeling. But, fever broke &amp; somewhat appetite. Ah yes event March 2020 restrictions totally comparable April 2021 vaccines immunity got it. Yeah, plus lot easier slack off, run random errands, etc. I’d imagine people would want this.

Also imagine businesses prefer people want come since they’re productive. imagine number remote jobs available, pay much office jobs. Or, bear here, time passed since last reported since millions vaccines delivered cases found? Putting blinders focusing one thing really viable long term strategy. We're worst it. Time start reopening process positivity optimism. minimum twice week? gained forcing people content capable working home? Yeah, stuff like makes unenthusiastic dreadful world going look like post-vaccination. Even Biden talking ‘nice little 4ths backyard family’.

Woop-de-doo. go trip full capacity concert without masks distancing? Ever again? go without mask nobody going stop you. It’s way months. last day company yesterday. I’ve ten years, thought going back sitting cubicle day depressed me. start new WFH job Monday. I’ll never work office again. Working home gives extra two hours day don’t spend getting ready work commuting. lost 40lbs gotten healthy weight mostly diet changes. really difficult maintain decent exercise routine kids home time. try home, constantly interrupted kids underfoot. Luckily weather getting nicer, even difficult younger kids. Same. like convenience money savings driving every day, I'm crazy house week Unsure getting downvoted. Yeah told wording weird.

Whatever. Homeoffice nice online classes. much less wasted time Hey, there. First thanks AMA. question Texas seeing record lows cases, they've fully opened despite warnings Fauci? testing slowed? people willing get tested? people outside more? agree. I've gotten lot closer colleagues team teams privacy conversations vs. sitting conference room together. Working lot like school. Sometimes hit coworkers become friends. Sometimes work team years stay coworkers. think what's important remote vs. person natural chemistry people. drive kid school, come back home, wash dishes breakfast make breakfast good tea start day way better mood often take shower lunch break.

Nice. 

I think 30 hour home work week would sufficient cover 40 hour office job, work commuting dressing impress, that's 20 hour week swing. That's part time job one's household. 

When moved departments, new boss said takes 10 hours home office work 8 hours normal office work. said takes 6 hours home office work 8 hours normal office work.

I clients request meet person getting harder harder tell since fully vaccinated. 

Still, think able keep least business virtual. makes logistics meeting much easier much better driving place. car last 5 years longer keep working home. pretty nervous got mine Monday. easy quick, barely felt it. arm sore bit yesterday that’s subsided I’m little tired usual nothing bad. even went walk right run yesterday. got Moderna. Managers inevitably going place this. managers think remote workers committed onsite workers. managers neutral topic, look remote work way attract retain talent. managers prefer purely remote management old ways.

If want make remote work work, find manager believes aligns you. They're giving vaccine legos? That's great; kids like lot vaccine shots! years wife travelling consultants. would get gigs east coast, projects would pay fly us there, put us up, feed us, work on-site. first fun, got old fast. 9/11, lived Atlanta, worked Manhattan, came ""home"" long enough laundry pay bills. years later, finally convinced long-term client really need on-site. saved thousands per month expenses started getting life back. moved home beach, outside work quality life much better. clients changed views remote work time. key mutual trust deliver home, IM, virtual meetings conference calls made easy collaborate way Zoom.

This pandemic shown many people I've experienced years. Remote work every one every type job. hard starting out. established workers handle lack direct supervision, improve quality life let live want instead work is.

I'm world toy stores. Remote work fit new industry well, hey, sell toys beach. bad gig. resigning next week 18 years company bringing us back office May. 8-10 hours commuting per week massive waste time earth, I’m sad ever it. know trump elected care (not american)

You can't replace entire workforce india. get pay use term Congress America. point? I’m waiting I’ve literally seen people say ‘hold little longer’. Like...when? What’s genuine hurdle goal us pass game could acceptable? Something easily determine, ‘herd immunity’ cause idk actually achieved. Plenty people went dinner chilled protests though! least lot people know would grab dinner drinks going chill after. to. I've gone couple NHL games Columbus. pretty decent sized list what's allowed:

25% attendance
Must wear mask times outside seat.
Must wear mask times seated, unless actively eating drinking.
No congregating open areas throughout stadium.
Every urinal blocked off.
Not concessions open cashless.
No exit re-entry smoking.

Ushers pretty strict mask thing too. I'm sure things compare stadiums/arenas around country I'd say hometown safely possible. One fortunate development. Medical authorities saying contact spread Coronavirus likely previously thought. things like touching balls bats etc may true spreaders. mostly breathing people's breath. IE, droplet spread. avoid that, likely remain safe. helps, I've shots, felt neither them, side effects all. wife. course commuting sucks! major needle phobia easiest shot I've ever had. Way better flu shot me. feel question nurse see actually injected me. worry!  get sensitive topic, interpretation comment noting may boon ""conventionally unattractive"" cutting discrimination know face daily basis. 

Obviously ideal solution discrimination happen whether they're seen not, that's unfortunately really difficult tackle. person pointing interviewer/customer looking face, can't discriminate service based look. 

I understand may perfectly good reason defensive, try let prevent accepting others try reach out, even regarding sensitive subject. Hopefully similar operations around country. lot older people trouble getting vaccines. not! least, period time needed lockdowns effect.

Society seems disagree essential workers going 'office'.

Define 'essential'. Grocery store workers essential unless alternate, reliable system food distribution. keep warehouses open, trucks roads, farms churning food (you can't exactly tell farmers maybe try plant wheat several months later). That's fuckload people need go day job food thing need take care much East Asia.

Strict border control must comes lockdown. happens COVID-19 success stories island peninsula nations. easier close ship everything tell sailors fucking leave port, one land border that's already strictly controlled (like South Korea).

Then people look countries wonder done Europe – lot nations landlocked goods transported trucks; borders recently completely open; there's lot people temporarily emigrated another country, commute work beyond border. Thanks fact checking! Yes. Unclear closing outdoor restaurants meaningfully affected hospital capacity.  looking forward working office again. miss interacting colleagues friends. me! Luckily boss said hybrid future foreverrrr think everywhere adopt system long term. We're going pandemics future New Zealand, Australia East Asia shown much better keep virus first place. I'd imagine Level 0 completely normal life, another one pops somewhere, we'd go level 1 straight away enact border closures certain countries. Personally I'm somewhere between. particularly love working home 24/7, I'm getting permanently base remote city like much better around me, working east coast schedule mountain time lifestyle finish 3.

I'm willing put little bit remote burnout keep close access family/friends/skiing/hiking/rock climbing/etc

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Restrictions incrementally lifted vaccination rates increase. another month almost every adult wants vaccinated, states already lifting releasing plans lift final restrictions (including mask mandates).

Be patient pay attention instead whining cruises people still scanning online desperately get appointment two weeks now. protests Germany 10k 20k people. That's nothing compared 80 million Germans.

A recent survey found [only 25% want less COVID measures 32% actually favour even stricter Chernobyl exclusion zone Fukushima exclusion zone 2600 4000 sq. km respectively. Orders magnitude land used solar wind. accidents occurred due outdated technology could avoided. Even factoring land habitability generation accidents, nuclear safest form energy generation. idea people complain land habitability disadvantage nuclear power hundreds thousands people becoming ill due emissions due fossil fuels every year. fossil fuel industry's lobbying misinformation campaigns would reluctance accept nuclear energy safe. He's wrong. efficacy vaccine around 90 percent, there's 10 percent left over. He's saying consider 10 percent instead ignoring it. Amen, desire ever spend another second life office traffic going one. overall quality life dramatically improved working home 5 days week. sleep quality sleep better, time work, used start exercising again. 

And like people, usually full 8 hours worth work day, I'm able use time learning new skills job, something enjoy instead sitting desk waiting around something happen.

The problem fully expect companies run old men make full push back 5 days week office, draconian. company recently sent email stating everyone back office full time June. already talked boss agreed hybrid model best overall, he's afraid may get overruled CEO another touch asshole.

I flat told office 5 days week, try force back office cases still quitting. Like many workers, skills transfer another company allow remote work, game town, look forward letting know want play hardball. offense, heck 25% want return office full time?! Another great question! Global lack vaccines could undermine control US. approved vaccines seem safe effective, great scale up. best way though, feasible, would establish mRNA production facilities regions. Although vectored vaccines cheaper easier handle, mRNA quicker scale, less susceptible production failures, easier tweak variants – i.e. much safer bet. colleague mine wrote month ago Great point pick boundary. similar.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Man, someone needs hug. vaccines it’s allergies immunodeficiency, right? mRNA would allergies. I’m sure reasons would common ones. Read comment. Downvoting british brigade proves fragile nationalist ego is. Much cautious responsible language Marco interview. Also EMA confirming vaccine continue rolled age groups. Though, see UK advising alternatives 30. Good see advice firming up. Well 30 get vaccine - want develop health issues get Covid... Depending got there’s record somewhere. ...we're best getting risk low possible prior lifting restrictions

No, we're best weighing competing interests determining relevant balance is. Absolutism comes minimizing risk defensible approach. Yup. long career worked multiple jobs various locations country made ""good friends"" possibly count. many still contact with? Exactly zero.  one life's saddest realities. bars concessions, bathrooms, etc indoors (or effectively indoors). NFL like third stadiums enclosed begin with. jobs want skills also want move are. going happen, especially computers let entire group go project over. joke programmers shore problem since cheap. company record breaking year 2020. actually got extra bonuses. first quarter 2021 we've hit goals.

We still executives sold remote work. I'd love send competitor losing us pressured people work office. worse ending remote work could secret success. I’m getting fine aware kids would vaccinated 2 months, no. learned hard first job. Thought ""early 20s sitcom coworkers"" vibe going. TV watch parties went happy hours.

Then left better job, 7 years later, can't even remember names. think he's suggesting take zero risk approach. think he's saying realistic risks instead plugging ears. Considering risk necessarily mean take said risk. Cant wait Saturday I'm guessing reason get blod clots getting real covid-19 give blood clots response immune system. vaccine response mimicking real symptoms. case, may need try reduce ""viral dose"" vaccine young people body fight aggressively. new building going we're growing faster build, building, set open October, already capacity. need people office 5 days week helps solve problem them, plus they're seeing employee wellness surveys come back positive results. Ironically pandemic risk management, bad risk management.

If miles help, downside something strands injures leaves water supply really large. take risk even *probably* work out. 5% chance stream getting high can't cross without getting gear wet freezing conditions? Cut trip short leave early. thing looking forward post-pandemic National Park tourons going back cruises amusement parks. ridiculous. article biiden's poliicy. going apply Market Basket working 40 hours still pays less unemployment benefits, prevents taking small amount work popped pandemic, led 40 hour, $40/hr job foreseeable future industry? Serbia vaccination rate 20% compared Germany's 12% lot better course lower UK's. OP 30 something able get randomly vaccinated speaks willingness get vaccinated Serbia anything else. course Germany population 84m compared Serbia's 7m, China Russia trying curry favour Serbia trying pull EU's sphere influence relatively small number doses goes long way. I'm likely get first jab next weeks, second one around July. likely AstraZeneca vaccine, I'll take I've given. Throughout pandemic risk averse: going much, using masks, etc. science say protection afforded 12 week gap jabs? risks take? behaviour change? second vaccine? Lol wtf talking medical reality, lmao? talking stances experts. delusion someone MHRA said EU Prizer trying harm AZ alterior motives? talking british nationalist flood sub constantly deny fuck ups problems AZ. hybrid schedule COVID (2 days remote 3 office) company gone full remote see problem that. jobs done 100% WFH, guess people still miss office really accustomed WFH. Needless say, space apartment focus work that's privilege I'm pretty sure lot people have. Nope, people are. got vaccination card it’s meant proof needed. Tell Scotland. 2 people allowed max unless people bring household them. that’s 3 1/2 months hard lockdown. article seems really misleading considering EMA literally said (summary: fine, chill out).  I’m US, high risk blood clots genetically med take. active, healthy 24 year old woman. this, doc said hold even getting covid vaccine higher normal clot indicators woman across board, AZ. Especially women high risk. Basically risk dying shot covid case. 

My doctor “anti-vax”, (and neither matter) incredible doctor great university hospital comment admonish me/her (probably non-doctor) maybe consider that. 

But yeah it’s kinda scary... small risk Norway, particularly compared risk Covid. theory like coke, ketchup companies work companies like McDonalds tweak packets contents taste certain way company. sure case across board though. 26 yo got second AZ jab today. Fuck. what's stopping you? Money exchanged goods services. ironic. may exacerbates people genetic susceptibility 

Yep, rather serious concerning given many people hospitalized COVID. death count everyone sees one piece long-term mortality implications here. study also conflates things like dementia anxiety broad umbrella “psychiatric conditions” get shocking headline result. 

It's lumping together neurological psychiatric conditions think problematic. obscures severe neurological issues much less likely much strongly associated severe cases. Given widespread severe cases been, still serious concern there, headline bad, agree. relevant flu associated complications known cause complications 

This little bit red-herring severe flu much less widespread acute COVID 19. flu much risk younger demographics risk young children, COVID much larger risk everybody else. What's relevant much virus spreading, apparent people get hospitalized. PCR tests highly accurate. Resolve, we've promoted balanced approach opening closing saves lives, keeps health care going, minimizes economic disruption. whole [one addressing particular.  Definitely effecting women’s mensuration. Period.   wondering might case. would nice bonus!  Wait, didn't? thought part whole deal... Cause people sick bull shit wanna live lives. I’m definitely 34%. I’ve convinced years real reason get extra early, dress classy go office 50 kilometres away. past year proven true is. course isn’t possible every job mine flat refuse go back office 5 days week. got first yesterday mass vax site - easy! Walked in, showed ID, confirmed appointment sent nurse's station. talked bit, stuck even knew going to, 15-minute phone session, good go! arm pain injection site mild fatigue today - advantages getting shot far outweigh downsides. say someone went crazy months due pandemic stress caused anxiety disorder. gonna fine! me. won’t drive hour 15 minutes morning night five days week ever again. pandemic 3 there, 2 home. huge project came worked looooot hours hard deadline, commute interrupting extra hours :/ full time home. done went 4 home, 1 office. pandemic. I’ve like four times total. day tell I’m going go every weeks day start looking something else. persuading anti vaxxer. 

They almost always uneducated superiority complexes extremely narcissistic result. don’t use logic reasoning draw conclusions anything. don’t believe even know how. 

They simply cherry pick anecdotes confirm bias. makes feel smart better rest people don’t “eyes” open. People Texas, things look like state right now, since guys 4 week anniversary mask mandate? Suck Sadly, several *vaccinated* friends still disinfecting ""quarantining"" packages, mail, grocery delivery. even get takeout restaurant delivery unless re-heat food, people preparing food \*might\* covid.  seem believe sort miasma theory walk sidewalk hiking trail 15 minutes unmasked stranger asymptomatic covid, \*will\* infected.

These reasonably-healthy people 30s 40s terrified interaction human beings. fear entirely disproportionate risk level. mean, I'm going quit job, ever want go back office. Rumor they'll allowing people want come back office full time opportunity so, hybrid schedule everyone else. 

My industry fortunate never saw downturn business pandemic, we've hiring like crazy. We've already outgrown building, opportunity exists stay WFH full time, I'm taking it. brought long ago they're already looking possibility apparently that's good. definitely want return office full-time. climate... daily commute absurd perspective didn’t CDC b117 pegged quarter cases less week ago word ""basically"" needed.

It's straight cut overall compensation package. never want go back. open windows house, natural light, go runs lunch, save money gas food, pollute less, get spend time family.... getting work done. 

I'd willing go office 1 2 times week every day go sake going. need actual reason go in. 

Oh coworkers getting vaccine, want see physically around them. you’re gonna pee attending outdoor gatherings. That's NFL games though. went one indoor stadium year. Capacity capped (about 12,500 70,000 seat stadium) much space people.  Give gift card Walmart Burger King vaccine site upon leaving, maybe. Whatever takes. opposite? it'll sweat speak? live Bayern. 70+ year olds permitted book appointments starting March 9 here, appointments (from know friends family) May onwards. lot outdoor sport issues sport, parents people watching sports.

They gather follow rules transmit themselves.

The strict rules professional sports managed. Good luck managing kids little league baseball game.

Where I'm also specifically called post game gatherings adults. Going beers socializing adult games. that’s going happen one baseball game Everyone access vaccine then. 20-25% country 16 protection. It’s bananas often people sub forget children exist. shit show especially AZ insisting there's even casual link that's refuted pretty much every health agency now

With UK getting Moderna well, deny issues like defend AZ PR dept

All took UK EU finally getting alternatives admit findings multiple agencies confirmed data weeks ago matter. kidnapping plot finally enough bully governor submission, hardly blame her. nihilistic wackos finally got wanted: restrictions, unlimited spread. I’m exact boat feel way.  I'm ya'll hybrid model sure. say something helps feeling talking dedicated work space home. hybrid/mostly remote pandemic (now remote), office house dedicated work helps psychological aspect. work there, 8-4pm I'm mostly room I'm traveling work. rest house no-work zone.

Idk dedicated office set worked dining room table/couch/etc much worse separate work time time. thought cared science. Odds vaccinated virus carrier extremely low. proud staying home really part. least like you. I’ll stick it. really liked aspect Japan. get sick cause I’m sick PTO? It’s dick move wear really. Also anyone really miss handshakes? know you’re office day pulling Chapmans gotta touch smeg? I’ll pass thanks. garbage lmao. major cities, people dont give shit walking around without mask. Philly, liberal city, see like...maybe 60% people wearing masks outside literally one cares. overestimating typical HR department. Yeah Fortune 500 company probably figured out, can't tell number ""discussions"" I've HR previous positions. Reqs sitting unfilled months people leaving competitors we've dropped 100k training new systems. (Pharma/biochem field)  Isn’t illegal? dress code aspect cannot understated. work job offer requiring strict dress code me. sit dedicated space day, fuck business business-casual BS. want wear sweats office that's I'm damn well doing. YES. #1 thing baffles me. anti-maskers, vaccine skeptics, think death toll overblown: seem issue running head first novel pathogen studying year, apprehension second thought it.

If look up, see pandemics killed humans history cause, COMBINED. even close anything else. due pandemic, see why.

Humans evolved better technology, tolerance torture suffering decreased, besides that: exact mentally, least comes disease management, thousands years ago. People seem intelligent able grasp gravity situation, willing sacrifice anything daily lives help avoid situation. apparent, there's kind deep seated normalcy bias: *""I get it, worse anything else""* *""you one life live, live fear""* (yet people run doctor anything else happens them).

If virus highly deadly, *as* contagious, hear saying *""Why measures? chances getting virus statistically low!"".* virus like SARSCOV2, highly contagious *quite* deadly something like Ebola, we're hearing *""It's many people dying! Look many people get without dying!""*. I'm convinced matter type virus let loose, people would simply refuse anything mitigate it. want rude call stupidity, another word it. Perhaps ignorance? avoid typical toxic office culture? freedom clothing? freedom breaks meals? Less stress? No, least risky option take Pfizer. giving option. team eats virtual lunch together twice week. It’s nice. don’t usually eat instead spend 30-60 minutes talking whatever. sad see city decisions made good public health. lots hardworking, excellent staff city agencies, City's response great. Currently, Black Latinx people NYC half likely get vaccinated White New Yorkers. Chicago King County Seattle done better. NYC better.

I think Summer/Fall, we'll much better position, unless new variants emerge even dangerous. Personally, I’m 25 don’t see anyone, it’s healthy mentally.

I would 3 day office/2 day home routine.

Honestly, job went permanent WFH plan leaving coming months, people end spectrum. retail side things work entire time. tell SQUEEZED near breaking points already. Half departments even take lunches let alone 15's anymore much work saddled us keep things going rest you. work decently high turn-over area full-timers basically work 2 3 people prices driven suck keep going. 

We considered replaceable second would devastate team work created bonds with. miss office work let already energizer bunny burnt out. went back something least made feel like connection community live in. expect company implement corporate level BS retail level. 

I burnt right saddled debt missed 2 job opportunities answer calls recognize due tired talking collection agency's. Shits F'ed YO. I've thing happen since covid kind chalked old. stood backyard yelling dog come getting worried escaped somehow dog walk house wonder I'm yelling him. tasked setting weekly meeting database project boss threw I'm ""good computers guy"" - I've remote job whole time since started last summer never met people involved. 


Like 3 weeks came light rehashing bunch stuff others already knew, nobody wanted speak Midwest nice thing. really believe person could've read room much better saved us bunch wasted time. Yeah, say that, won't. UE runs there’s stimulus. want jobs back. pandemic ever end America? World? Oops Robert Half. Could get professionals survey instead?

The results make sense me, based every interaction I've company 0 chance survey run correctly. 100%. terrible work culture (in US) wonder problems burnout cannot set boundaries separate identity self worth careers. Companies helped either, think since access work via technology time, available times. muted banned exchange: position vindicated MHRA seems made one mods rather angry. worked remotely 11 months say productivity way impacted, anything got done. said 50/50 employees supervise seemed work harder others seemed like better try ""trick"" call program making look like were. think really comes office jobs done home good employee good employee regardless job from.  amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Explain I'd disagree - baseball game probably fine, I'd guess people baseball games = people bars restaurants before/after game, could problem think people realize many office workers never left already went back office last year. started new job front end web dev December 2019. Fast forward last week March 2020. Friday told grab everything belong us, chance coming office next week. Sure thing. working home since, told telework likely till 2022. 

Learning remotely challenge. 3 months commuting, minimal interaction coworkers. I'm one people would rather stay remote permanently. Finding older coworkers want come office. I'm 30s, commute total 3 hours day life changing. mention lunch break truly mine now. eat walk dogs. go pickup kid daycare. 

My stress levels due work/life balance barely existent. idea OP message would deleted! :( 

The government allowed every possible vaccine:

Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm/Beijing, Sputnik V

So choose wait specific vaccine get filled.
My divorced parents got Sputnik &amp; Pfizer rest family got Sinopharm. don’t see lot masks crowd work tried pandemic found work well (not sure why, started). went back office full time. pandemic changed again, guess we'll see happens after. real, seriously almost try avoid reading articles days they're shocking scaring reading actually explaining topic about. literally done both. got called day gigs picked up. also able stay city Market Basket wages, afford unemployment. Market Basket pays half unemployment is, unemployment already half normal wage.  Also supplying India approximately ₹ 150-160. average price around $20 (Rs 1,500)... (but) Modi government's request, providing subsidised rates...It we're making profits... making super profits, key re-investing,"" said. hub exactly problem. PMs detail wranglers prefer person. gravitate towards show often. show going seen better. 

I know choice usually good, like companies offer ""unlimited"" vacation. unlimited try use it. 

Hubs like describe hasten return full time office work. presumably means don’t intend using Florida based ports resuming.  even then, may think healthy know something normally wouldn’t start showing later life. many, might even know covid heart lung damage. scary! paid might ability situation befall you...""self respect?"" labor done self respect lol. also, states wage limit earnings pay nothing make token amount still would enough live of. Florida 250$ week. would say Chicago, New York, San Francisco biggest “mask times else” cities US. Boston, Seattle, LA probably right also. going away either. new perk/selling point bring candidates. Sounds like personal problem use boundaries. definitely problem who's solution affect everyone said job. mods decided stop letting 50 people spam links Always where. got free money put market that’s 230% YTD (not exact numbers) I’ll that. *checks plan* nope health plan here. idk count major city, confirm that's case Detroit, Grand Rapids, Lansing, Kalamazoo. immediate area, people resisted masks poured droves businesses open. Many finally wore masks, not, wrong. ditching masks again. people tried. call proper lockdown. lot cases lot deaths.  everyone forgetting social interaction fun ways covid goes away? totally depends industry position, office jobs done *somewhat* efficiently home, many would better hybrid setting. Zoom meetings build teams promote teamwork well person meetings IMO. mean every meeting needs person, level person interaction generally good thing -I think productivity long term mental health. 

My job primarily remote pandemic -I tell eventually gets old look forward person meetings social interaction. biggest issue hybrid schedule completely working home see largest corporations buildings expensive cities land sudden going MASSIVE reduction demand therefore price rent them.

So bank work owns one expensive buildings world. Prior pandemic rented floors companies economical rent elsewhere staff make money floors owned.

So bank allows staff work home would signal don’t value office space all. another firm pay space longer value all. 

I see argument firm already valued higher bank time still going much less prior pandemic.

To sum up, large firms let people work home loss rental income property values plummet. going happen Anti-maskers (maybe minus restrooms). expected results. necessarily. Check health plan work. access program called Active Fit $25 month access thousands gyms across country, including major national chains. Dependents join well. sign many want simultaneously. get choose. many probably prefer mRNA based vaccines. specifically looking places lockdowns worked, worked locations lockdown adequetely enforced kept place community transmission eliminated.

Where lockdowns failed, enforced sufficiently and/or relaxed community transmission eliminated.

Those failed lockdowns measures (social distancing, masks, etc) almost certainly save lives, nearly much successful lockdown elimination would done. Laughing Brazilian whats app language Well won’t get far. still requiring masks several places. lockdown forever (""off cards time""), suggesting?

You realize country can't really afford lockdown anymore? Cough. sub. Cough cough No, impossible prove lockdown desired effect. Every wave go point does, inevitably attributed restrictions. doesn't:

1. enough time work.
2. fault people follow new restrictions lockdown even harder make them.
3. real lockdown, strict enough.

No matter happens, governments get look good despite outsourcing war virus ordinary people. Success always attributed actions, rabble heroically try save gets blamed failures. think governments also fit description constantly giving information nothing back lockdown come August-September go towards Autumn? 

What solution vaccines provide ""out""? 30 euro fine would enough encourage common sense. It’s like people know research spend hours “researching” nonsense regurgitated multiple websites/ YouTube videos originate source. Studies using pseudoviruses reliable terms determining vaccine efficacy. study posted OP far robust. Remember Pfizer studies showing several fold reduction neutralizing titers actual trials showing still highly effective. new strains called variants instead mutations, kind spin? It’s required, it’s implemented way implementing system private business required operate business functional level capacity.

Absolutely nobody going implementing business without state federal government specifically funding restricting way encourage it. fly lot. usually get sick several times year.  year back airplane haven’t gotten sick like past. think may continue wearing one planes.

If bunch people caught mild cold host virus without symptoms, hospitalizations deaths, society largely vaccinated, see issue here. contracts signed? US December 9th. Significantly contracts signed. I'd imagine significantly easier singing severe lung disease. bad thing, considering ketchup full sugar. US given 170 million shots 28% population reportedly vaccine appointments available today 800 counties across US (per GoodRx). someone priority group shot yet, chance. long supposed wait? unfortunate truth many people never get vaccinated (by choice) can't keep society locked change minds. much urgency reopening vaccine.

In area teachers/child care group 1b know vaccinated January February. reason teachers vaccinated schools open. strongly suspect delays simple logistics teachers union digging heels matters principle. feel ""forced"" work ""forced"" take vaccine. even though available, either refusing take taking refusing teach, apparently allowed. using situation bargaining chip. school 80% teachers available remain closed even though 80% students could go. everyone impacted refuse comply. equal urgency re-opening schools dealing virus. kids teenagers struggle cope situation. friends developing serious mental health issues, failing classes, social isolation, botched college prep, suicidal ideation, etc. friend mine two kids 17 19 check separate mental health facilities past week likely miss 2nd year school traumatized medications. much longer going wait?

A ""case"" anything someone sick hospital, young healthy person tested positive. Case counts metric instead hospitalizations fatalities. close schools businesses bad flu season lot cases. Cases today completely different year ago most, virtually lead hospitalization death.

These unfounded rumors variants, long covid, etc. excuses keep worry lockdowns forever. one hand Fauci says reduce restrictions science clear. However problem embracing potential problems like variants long covid science clear. Symptoms ""long covid"" include anxiety. we're going keep society locked everyone free anxiety? People lost minds. would possible Sweden reach low excess mortality rate Finland, considering mid march world shut down, Sweden already high internal spread Finland not.

So anything less countries started comparable high internal spread mid march performed worse Sweden regardless strategy. Yeah, guess that's detectable far children recovered. Signs long term damage here! gets worse every second :( Obviously. like 'we need cowbell' need lockdowns.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people need read comment opening link :D think used talking terms scientific communications, things can't confirmed true, simultaneously things could happen — even unlikely — least credible.

If scientist, know give due credence.

If layperson like me, media, tend treat concerns though predictions; take ""no evidence"" (because available *yet*) dismissal.  $$$$ get vaccinated, live life normal except wear mask keep distance possible. Go eat, movies, museums, etc.

I personally would expect masking commonplace another two months so.  like think things lol hope right. comment meant opinion. fear have.  That’s whole idea. CDC says never eat beef less medium well put sun screen every time go outside. *very conservative* public health recommendations. groups least likely anti-vaxxers

The ones still alive.. Good. I’d argue sooner Ummm... actually can. Vaccinations variety communicable diseases mandated military, hospitals, nursing homes, schools quite fields. COVID added list. 

Employers mandating vaccines perfectly legal taken place decades. leg stand on. 

Go back losing shirt betting stocks, depth discussing ""medial"" topics. read comment responded to? Wtf wrong you. 4K large sample size. It’s tenth size phase three studies, example. 

The U.K. study 24k hospital workers.

The Israeli study 1.2 *million* people general Israeli population. 


Most tellingly, 95% confidence interval CDC study wide - includes numbers found Israel U.K. Don’t worry rest New York much same. Pritzker said phase 5 includes masks CDC says get rid them. try patient. crazy year, there's going kind reactions process moving it. return normalcy cards (""but...for long?"" want dramatic). Osterholm asked sports one podcast episodes, specifically hockey. noted way cold air hangs rink makes environment highly suitable transmission (they know past viral outbreaks). 

Here MN, youth hockey source one major outbreak (known) death one referee. qualify limited supplies accordance CDC guidelines, testing limited certain patients.

CVS' website one places state limited availability.

I mean hope post correct, would like concrete information flies ends stuck can't help get tested that's all. I’d expect tomorrow big day represent Monday lot states lowered age requirements. Oh, wow. didn’t know proved innefective. source that? I’m asking I’m brazilian vaccines parents grandparents receive probably Sinovac ones. haven't. distancing masks.

They also vaccines. also wrong; elderly groups least likely anti-vaxxers; largest group anti-vaxxers 45-54 age group. seem made clear won’t database would make impossible implement anything international travel. won’t stop private company it, opens lot security concerns private company managing database like that. Yeah seen posts past days That’s getting - one currently considering running real shot. Go Girl! many countries nowhere near enough vaccines thus passports would discriminatory, cannot limit right move travel within EU, unless there's state emergency (which many dropping coming weeks). ou're actually monster. One human control another, period.

I'm pro vaccine, pro education, pro body autonomy. Teach people vaccination important science behind makes sense. fucking strap people force ruin lives. need 100% vaccination attempting force people going harm good.

Imagine educating people, removing productive society will, expecting sudden change opinion submitting. Anyone two brain cells rub together see go well.

This garbage opinion. Stick posting semen payload. talking time summer, everyone vaccinated willing vaccinated, capacity restrictions anything. allowed host 500 person wedding, staff need wear masks entire time guest actively eating drinking. means masked ceremony, pictures, dancing, etc. actual policy put forth here. Ma-ma, Ma-ma feed me...(suckling sounds.) flat illegal. ""We"" nazi Germany? exact kind reasoning used commit crimes humanity. Depends city. reference this? limited all. CVS test anyone. got second Moderna shot today.

Not much line drive short wait.

I hope means everyone getting vaccine refusing get one. Step 3, one unvaccinated person allowed per 50 square feet 300 people, plus number vaccinated people. Outdoors, 900 unvaccinated people plus number vaccinated people allowed gather.

Lol that's fun one heck long Covid lol. vaccinated, good go! Bars open schools. Things going normal still want gavyn Newsome governor may pushed people wear masks beginning wouldn’t otherwise. However, removal hasn’t changed anything. CA opens everyone next week, they’ll 60 days get shots, 30 said. totally sympathetic situation. Obviously, would help peace mind, travel, obviously, can't guarantee 100% certainty know fact, honestly can't even imagine EU viewing vaccinated simply got vaccine, EMA approve, Serbia. unimaginable me. Yes, pushed hard school arrange schedules students dedicated teacher mode instruction, though pretty much teachers online person sections. worked much better way give group full attention instead dividing it, traditional labs in-person students prepare kits pickup online students give students home attention they're using kits, etc. There's lot I've done able divided attention. What's link time year COVID New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York? July 4th?? Wow, thought CA would last reopen... True. latter happening, soooo... far 9% population taken first dose vaccine Exactly. Cook County decides entire state's politics, unless literal rest entire state REALLY like Cook County doing, case they'll (temporarily) band together barely push pedestal. interjected ""better late never""

Why even put that? even mean referring to? comment responded addressing possible problem timing based policy written.

So last line for? referring to? Nobody chose black. getting vaccine choice. Since link latest articles, actual — New research suggests protection Moderna vaccine gives COVID-19 lasts least six months.   report Tuesday New England Journal Medicine echoes Pfizer said last week vaccine, works similar way.  reports based follow-up tests dozens people received shots studies led vaccines’ use. studies done troubling new variants, versions coronavirus, emerged started spread.  separate report medical journal adds concern variants. Scientists measured antibodies block virus 50 people given Sinopharm Sinovac vaccines developed China. Many showed total partial loss effectiveness virus variant first detected South Africa.  vaccines still seemed protect variant first found United Kingdom rapidly spreading United States elsewhere.   Moderna said working update vaccines, possibly design booster shot, case they’re needed variants.

Please try link actual articles can, rather live update links, often information gets lost new articles added. biden administration announced they're going vaccine passports, kind moot point.  social distancing 2018 afraid lose hero status days fine. Um, dude, I'm saying bars going check immunizations (even though should), I'm saying already equivalent checking ID make sure 21. literally already done every club bar every major metropolitan area way works decades.

Those us care patronize establishments require vaccine checks. Pretty simple free market works, eh?

I think realistic view reality. Actually probably couldn't.  Nothing really changed Texas since mandate lifted. never enforced state anyway. big cities, people still wear masks indoors establishments still mask requirements. Again, technically enforceable there’s lot self policing among populace. mandate removal pure political theater. Seriously. less 20k fully vaccinated. anyone new favorite travel large states get passport anyhow. know California require it. recent report sinovac ineffective B.1.135 variant somewhat similar P1 variant, making sense now. Alright seems like vaccine news wildly underselling progress effectiveness. mRNA vaxs protective variants far real world data, yet articles, variants (even B117) going make pandemic last years more. really sure media portrays vaccines way much... Sure  great see one worst-hit Covid nations got back feet solid vaccine rollout. almost Americans got rid toxic ineffectual regime. 

But that's none business, I'm fucking Canadian. leaders can't even spell vaccine without double checking motherfucking thesaurus. EU already setting digital verification system work across entire EU this, reason expect work internationally.

Let alone, many regions already require vaccinations go ludicrous expect able done Covid? vaccine kids.

Cool, cool, cool playing games. ""voluntary"" attendees sign show pass, allowed don't. everyone understands vaccine pass idea mean. could ""voluntary"" sense?

I’ve met bunch people, many backgrounds, northern San Diego O.C. bleeding-heart liberal Democrats. Looking precinct level maps, generally sky-blue districts trending bluer, including La Jolla. They’re beginning elect pretty progressive Democrats House (think Katie Porter Mike Levin). entirely true. They’ve encouraged vaccinated, much less effective. category faced continue face differing degrees risk tons different viruses. agree comment doesn’t mean start vaccine check-points domestic use. risks potential negative impacts society whole far outweigh benefits small group people like immunosuppressants. Becuase take years beurocracies set international database ""passports"" verification, otherwise paper cards forged time (probably even illegall, they're state issued documents). messaging 5 years [**2026-04-06 23:02:06 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2026-04-06%2023:02:06%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

Point taken. strong evidence work much longer. Well *did* know covid haha. She’s extremely cautious it. actually asked help heard pass antibodies baby breast milk wanted protect 6 month old son. heard *some* stuff it. She’s generally kind oblivious person. I've gotten doses pretty much coworkers well! anxiety pretty much dissipated.

I’m questioning it’s going affect life. I’m going worried catching spreading anymore Okay I’ll bite. Say eliminate Covid US borders. ensure stays out?

Again it’s simple like island nations cut air travel. Agreed you. Couldn’t happy get vaccine go normal thank you! Sure, Vermont's voting populace way, governor lean. Sorry I'm bothering boring stuff :D

I'm EU national, living Germany (at least immediate future) need travel time time Spain check family. try avoid unnecessary travel whole situation changes, something happens option. Although family members vaccinated vaccinated soon, would feel safer visit knowing suppress virus myself. tapas parties, 2 family members, 2 different households. past visited one problem, safe playing (1 trip since pandemic started).

Because clears travel purely assistance urgent without warning, would great sure would recognized whenever proof vaccination accepted reduce/avoid quarantine forth. know trust Germany Spain may find Serbian vaccination suspect consider ""proven"" somehow, specially since discussion ""covid passport"" even set stone moment. experience vaccines travel (never needed shot).

Also, medically speaking, would happy peace mind. I'm avoiding others like plague, never know. feel like still leaves wiggle room allowing international travel.

Either way, thank you. would mean would available since demand less. Might Easter slow reporting. Hopefully not. Honestly assume zero protection 2 weeks point assume risk lowered 80 percent. I'm young healthy level risk acceptable everyone make decisions based personal level risk. P1 pretty common Italy spreading much, less UK one excess death shy get infected along shyguys replies missing point little. 95ish percent effectiveness--on own--is nowhere near good enough stop wearing masks, especially since they're low-hanging fruit.

**With herd immunity**, though, truly see ""100% effectiveness"" vaccines. Herd immunity looks likely happen summer. soon bank it. way soon announce (ending mask mandates).

Folks need hold horses. mask mandates forever. Ipsos study found vaccine hesitancy POC communities white communities. regards COVID vaccine. sure you’re getting downvotes—at least reasonable disagreement. decision based scientific data gathered Florida one oldest populations, survived superbowl ""super-spreader"" parade, open without state government mask/business mandates. cases get control deaths.

That's really gambling all. kinda like knew exactly going happen did. Last time checked business owners people No, that's true. Adjusted population United States, would equivalent 6523 one day mandating fine, wish federal government would come better way prove vaccination status. CDC cards nearly useless, easy forge, cards aren’t durable.

Other countries likely require proof vaccination later it’d nice standardized verifiable document that. definitely something good. expect funeral cost much. know. Colorado too, big problems fall fine winter.

Lol, symptoms, 100% sure COVID - mono. Whole doctors office cheered lab results came back, apparently. get hopes though statistically likely COVID :/ hang dude. really think planes, games, theaters go that?

Well, states control planes, that's federal. First all, voted Biden lol libertarian, good one dude.

Second, help pandemic? still can't funeral services due social distancing regulations expense part outside physically burying person around $1k-5k average. 


So giving $9k something cost almost half make sense? Also, going pay that? justified taxpayers pay something caused pandemic unavoidable uncontrollable situation anyone Earth? Nonexistent.

Yeah, sub goes cycles depending time day is. I'm sure that's complete argument. pointed liberal big cities almost businesses still require mask wearing

That's still mandates, set privately rather government. Now, might say means need mandates. businesses take cues government. state like California, semi-cautious government, removes mask mandates, that's likely signal businesses stop requirements.

I think mask mandates one last things go, wait *really* herd immunity essentially zero deaths. probably July later. the...? still answer lmao. read article, I'm sure did.

Just give straight answer man. write that? deflecting starting get funny. Means get shit ton votes. Sorry, think misreading I'm writing. I'm *not* saying things saying untrue, I'm *not* saying are, individually, conspiracy theories. conspiracy theory is: ""these pharma companies evil cannot trusted, thus vaccine bad unsafe."" things saying facts framed way attempts support imply theory. mean almost 80% hasn't. 7 vs 25 pretty effective think anyone's questioning quality scientific data South Africa - actually, think world really grateful high quality study results we've received South Africa's strong contribution health region.

Again, booster developed insurance. current trials safety trials, efficacy trials, conducted anywhere willing volunteers. newly updated vaccine proven safe, ready tested hotspots latest variants existing vaccine formulas prove protective.

mRNA vaccines genetic code spike protein, modifications, delivered prefab vaccine convinces cells produce protein. Think vaccine envelope spike protein message. spike protein appears looks different, B1.1.351, make new vaccine targets matter _hours_, long know whether vaccine necessary community.

Making vaccine easy part. Distributing testing hard part, I'm glad they're getting head start case. hope, everyone's sake, necessary.

I agree Moderna's pricing philanthropic way, also think they're unfairly targeting particular region; think they've set price high end range governments willing pay. initial US government contract satisfied, surprised see discounted doses become available worldwide countries list price feasible.

From Seattle, I'd like send best wishes country speedy victory COVID. trip planned visit South Africa pandemic began forced cancel, I'm really hoping I'll able visit near future - friends South Africa speak highly natural beauty, cuisine, wine culture.

Is news people? Students literally forced school parents children vaccinated past MMR refusing rectify this. probably right. sub article Gov Abbot TX thing people shitting it. utterly asinine we're point even care policies care obliterating side even happen agree must oppose death. directly endanger others people wear masks interior spaces.

It's perfectly apposite comparison. meant compare mask wearing speed limits, though like that, describing allowing drivers choose reasonable speed would colocated argument. Instead comparison logic offering result decision vindication decision. demonstrates precisely nothing texas made questionable public health decisions nothing happened seen hindsight. forseable solid public health. gamble get lucky, mean risk management sound.  received notification talking double mutant strain. mean? employer hospital, damn well bet force get it.

Many Asian countries flattened Europe first wave. Thank you!! People reddit realize whole situation Scott atlas plan herd immunity without vaccines capacity fight lawsuits Texas lol, death measure health.

These excuses pulling finger actually needed done. It’s Reddit. Everyone mother claim productive home. Doesn’t mean employer agrees. That’s horrible agree nearly enough protect essential workers. schools outside west coast open already though. see schools haven’t open shouldn’t open now, don’t see reason close places like New York haven’t huge contributor spread. I'm guessing people programs computer tracking idle time like legit work home companies do. I've worked home long time pandemic trust expectations get even higher.  put software computer track idle time able see given minute. Requiring job search unemployment makes sense... businesses closing left right reducing employees due cutbacks. state's governor lifted requirement that. Makes sense making people put risk searching jobs businesses jobs going around. Top talent want work office simply find employment elsewhere. 

The dynamic changing smart companies paying attention. Lol ask NJ train users monthly cost get NYC. like $300+ sometimes especially schedule. That's lower mask usage New Zealand. I'll quit think I'm ever working office again. 

Fuck idea hybrid offices. Let us want. We're meeting end goals, stop oppressing us. plug pay rate inflation calculator date started, received amount pay increase, essentially taken much pay cut well. overall theme us getting fucked every way possible.

Yeah mean Jack Dorsey said people *absolutely* need come office *may* able work home future, far less people think. goes dying Covid healthy 20 year old though, pointless risk take, evidently MHRA agrees offering alternatives, would they? Opposite here... I'm 30-40 age range, country hellbent offering AZ AZ 65 cohorts, reserving rest older (which, yeah, make sense), I'm rather likely offered AZ. would strongly prefer get different vaccine, would mind paying €2000 it, probably given chance. 

If gave freedom us decide instead ""take leave it"", would happier. simply true. Nobody throws away leftovers. reason vaccinate 24/7 limited supply. Bavaria published numbers 0,2 percent vaccines disposed. However, even mostly due transport issues insufficient cooling what? Many new jobs person... Fuel, vehicle maintenance, especially parking always free. denied anything, said keep review. still causal link, correlation owing success vaccine drive lockdown afford cautious. scroll way far find this. So, seems school prom mid-May seniors. However, information document sent us, says CDC recommending proms cancelled. true? Choice definitely needed, I'm really conflicted personal situation. love WFH obvious reasons, went office first time yesterday since last March productive least four months. know every day lockdown (eat, work, sleep, repeat), without ability socialise outside work *anything*, I've procrastinating lot since autumn. Although definitely enjoy waking earlier getting train, office yesterday kind reinvigorated little. felt normal, normality sorely missed. assuming everyone friends see frequently enough replace everyday social interaction coworkers.

My husband works long hours see couple hours day, wrangle toddler dinner bed.

I lucky see friends month, distance schedules.

Our coed softball team even fell apart now, even week summer either. least husband still bowling league... days person interact face-to-face 2 year old.

I'm extrovert doubt I'm one still stuck similar social interaction slump restrictions lifted. us need face face interaction least couple times week. Nah, us brutal commutes. Mine pre covid 100 miles way car 5 days week. Last time: ***no idea*** OC's son even hospitalized comment history ***does not*** support presumption. based speculation feels, reals. 

Please nice day. I’d interested figured out. Also part young extroverted company. Sales, tons socialites.

Our ratios say are, think need fact gathering. Corp wide survey took recently showed less 9% 2500 local employees want full-time office back. 72% voted hybrid, last 18% want full time WFH.

Please, fact gathering presuming extroverts want back office. do, adapted social lives. makes sense. job nothing like meeting days. could see office would help those. Airlines need it. Insurance premiums also based vaccination. work tech outsourcing happening decades now...if want specific type talent outsource. right ☝🏼 I'd say spent 21 years living Putin's dictatorship, warped sense right wrong.

The ongoing shishow Chechnya ring bell? early 2000s, drafted still sucked. lot.

I clearly able change mind, let's end discussion. Goodbye.  UK part EU customs union recently, connected mainland freaking tunnel, makes transporting goods truck competitive alternative shipping it. worry people well really think everyone gets vaccinated, things get better, everyone gets offline goes places, people slowly drop paranoia. lot comments talking people working home feel disconnected socially. feel like issue arising structured around work, since people spend much time develop strongest emotional ties there. working home becomes norm may see groups/organizations springing order people get social interaction. could start massive cultural shift people seek adult clubs social interaction.

 (this hasn’t happened fully yet pandemic still going on. everything opens real, WFH becomes norm, may see explosion adult clubs) pass park train station I’ll commute boss meeting day can't believe got 100k socializing.. got introuble caller another coworker speak coworkers things I'm going quit go back office 🤷 moderna vaccine doses month now. I’ve started going back gym mask wearing mask pretty unpleasant. I’d say 25-40% people wear mask. Honestly, everything I’m seeing, fine without mask since vaccine protects me, right? I’m young less risk. hear you. It’s frustrating. want get back close normal, soon can. think 2 parts answer this.

First, June/July we’ll enough people vaccinated lot things able open, fall new normal, unless really bad variants undermine this. “hang months longer” frustrating message, it’s right one.

But second, always believe straightforward open. don’t think we’re going back old normal. unvaccinated people. risk variants. realize wearing masks could save tens thousands lives flu illnesses every year. East Asia, people routinely wear masks indoors don’t feel well, also (or stay home!). That’s speak new normal, normal. think get everything open, masks, hope, stay – many circumstances! got Sinopharm since available menu. However, waited hours, could gotten Pfizer. Oh well... think next generation talent going come industry people working home time? graduate intake industry already behind curve. company taking bringing people office primarily less experienced people learn. one going reach top game working home. say much misconceptions overconfidence. truth there's lot still know, frank that. people universities little experience actual disease control may make assumptions may work, work better, may may correct, state forcefully. always easy criticize outside, inside, challenges real, always apparent. wrote [article time back. title article unfortunate, really concerned lay epidemiologists, rather people pontificating universities limited real knowledge infectious disease control. absolutely *not* surprise me. I'm usually one day week.....we're essential workers manage generally get random day that's helpful.

I dare say accelerated desire retire sooner rather later. pretty close Thing now! Yiiiikes Well, sure. 

But I'd felt lot better news last year ""hey, here's medical scientist telling wear mask stay away people knows disease spreads air breath in/out. We'd include Johnny car mechanic's opinion, sadly opinion fucking irrelevant right now. Anyway, sit tight we've got ways combat thing, we'll keep touch, bye"" instead got. hurt you? doesn't. Theres case hospital january 2nd, 3rd, 6th,19th january 30th. Look again. Here's screenshot Jan 2nd one highlighted: *early* studies vaccines preventing COVID spread. likely limited data far.

So then, businesses would taking massive liability let people run around unmasked.

See here: I've done mixed remote years. avoid office go in, get nothing done. Everyone wants talk something catch up. know ever actually get work done spend day talking like do, spend entire night working.

Our company probably back summer ends I'm dreading WANT go socialize more..... I’m inclined believe you, haven’t pushing “get vaccinated go back normal narrative”? bury lead? regardless.


Nationality? No. British nationalists reddit. Sure. money gas, food, etc. I've saved lot, til got laid off. 2 3 want return office, that's catchy headline think depends job. There's way would able make time get know coworkers without working overtime meeting deadlines. It’s tech people. Many many companies requiring employees go back.  Same. enjoying 2 3 rotation dumbass government decided people could either get permission commute work submitted remote workers 2nd lockdown (that's going 4 months), both. immediately called office asked take name remote worker list. Half half thereabouts optimal, since forced us choose, I'm choosing office.

I still work odd day home unofficially, thankfully, miss previous arrangement. commute covid 1.5 hours way good day left 530am stayed work 730pm. 405 really like that. There's way fuck I'm going back that. I'm saving *at least* 15 hours per week 300 dollars per month commuting. tell public goods viewed welfare least people charge despite fact many riders upper middle class even 1%.  decision makers quietly ride shit save lives figure people choice.

As Canadian one things took completely surprise US; larger cities using subway/metro standard part life, think people would consider idea looking people riding transit insane. can't understand people would try use something like drive class divisions not. Right. droplets airborne, meaning traveled air. We’ve already this. 34% workers soon face reality. PFizer, Moderna, J&amp;J protect it, nothing worry we're vaccinating 4 million day I'm teacher well, students class checked out, 50%+ freshman sophomore class failing 3 classes. same. J&amp;J vaccine could used alternative give better guarantee protection? imagine bus route 1.25 hours way, imagine might involve switching buses time waiting next bus/walking bus stop.  Well, state's site, step always making claim, well 'how many days look' along series checkboxes different approaches take. guess could left blank, wanna risk paid. parents felt exact way 2nd dose Pfizer vaccine. Fever, chills, nausea. felt fine second Moderna dose. people sensitive immune systems unlucky. hospitals never over-run.

You wanted be, though. didn’t write definition. is. Even vaccine NYC isn’t back 10% normalcy. People believe want food, it’s insane. overweight mom drowns food olive oil, it’s “healthy fat”. smoothies full juice (sugar), they’re “natural” thus must healthy. lol everyone works white collar job sorts cushy benefits make enough work out. lot early discoveries heart cardiovascular system made Han Dynasty.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  College everyone, agree 100%, need high school diploma. Welcome Thunderdome.

2 variants enter, 5 mutated variants 1 super mutant leave. Amen! Im schmooze hate say bunch backstabbers. Yeah friends, kept touch. old office wfh good 10 years, happiest years ever spent there. I'm unconventional woman, always got ration work didnt 1. Dress like wanted 2. Act way either. Always loud kiss ass tried. always thought, man, would admired. realized..theres reason dad went far did..the Apple fall far tree. I'm darn good employee sphere. Always willing step project. volunteer work overtime. Know I'm doing. But... soft skills, yeah much. know current date missed vaccine rollout? interesting sure. 

I think companies want kind office presence. need team meetings, collaboration, virtual “presence” rooms, vendor visits etc. Holy crap, preach. desk home living room, right next kitchen. PC also desk, spend considerable amount time overall personal work stuff. want buy house market insane, inventory. can't wait go back office desk. wish could wfh industry, unfortunately, kind requires us site. I'll probably stay job years look remote work headline implies mutated fully airborne (ie without need droplets), pretend phrase ""spread air"" used innocently here. “Cheer, cheer Old Notre Dame” Yeah that’s exactly did. Work gave 700 pound pay rise deemed enough said rest given extra benefits better pension. really really really wanted tell go pound sand moment instead called contacts, went interviews next week quit job telling I‘d gotten twice much would needed pay keep also got promotion. 

You‘re helping anyone quitting immediately. look something better first still getting paid. Yup. therefore none rights absolute. could restricted. Say due world pandemic.

So would ok make restrictions predicated ""moral"" thing . case vaccinated. idea took people 2020 realize this. reason think Zoom better meetings technical glitches common plausibly blame one want leave meeting early. Somehow don’t see lot companies convinced. Last time: That’s study shows — **airborne droplets**. literally nobody called “airborne pathogen doesn’t need water spread” you. Fair point remember nobody knows long term effects covid be. could symptoms don’t show years. idea. I’ve heard companies repurposing space virtual meetings collaboration space instead offices cubes. 

We see next couple years. hope shows too! matter work make ""giving them"" time feel better.  bother saying hi point slack.... I've heard nothing infertility issue anti vaxx bs. obvious would good thing anyone make kids mass infertile. quit find new job. even article? real question is, “How many 34% actually quit?” People talk big game absolutely nothing. it! *insert Shia LeBouf meme here* Sparky,

This me, ain't bot. Send reply, Gods Moderation ""removed it"" ""political"". Yeah, mine back napkin calculation. 2 hours commute time 5 days week times 50 weeks (I get 80 hours pto per year). 500 hours driving comes almost 21 24- hour days. It’s depressing much life wasted jobs. ""rather quit"" I'd rather quit go back work period. know... Bills living all.  ... people even read article?  Yeah, apple fall far tree. Lazy, paranoid entitled educrats breed lazy, paranoid entitled students. I’m guessing you’re 30-49 age group, you’ve still got good chance getting Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax possible even J&amp;J get letter late May? 

I wonder Uk phase AZ quietly sell desperate country? Stupid question, job done home can't employers also assume done outside USA? It’s probably even harder parents currently is. suppose think you’re terribly clever. Take upvote. social interactions working relationships integral part people able jobs. think two separate things?

Look, living really unsexy, dry, 'boring', people excited despite fact organization obligated play certain rules arm local government. personal connection kind work working relationships people org key able get done. easy fully remote, I'm eager get back office.  Say totally different things. One thought could set hospitalization vaccination metrics full reopening w/ mask mandates figures less former higher latter full reopening without mask mandates. I'm GenX 35, lump us boomers, please! 

I also read Graeber's book resonated me. get boomer attitude towards work all, probably they've never left jobs give people age chance move up, never got indoctrinated. important things life work. think difference boomers (mostly boomers, always) think way knew job bullshit beginning, interest climbing corporate ladder anything. Sure, money would nice, I'd take time flexible hours money day. raise promotion means go early, stay later, respond emails weekend, I'd rather lower paying position less prestigious job title life back. current estimates take couple years vaccinate world. 

20 % US swearing never get vaccine &amp; kids yet approved. 

Then many parents let get it? kids around 20% US population.

Estimates herd immunity minmum 70%, depending infectious re-infectious covid variants circulation.

the UK &amp; US already planning needing boosters covid. 

If want avoid playing covid outbreak wack mole news several years sort requirements international travel. amazing newfound power people this, complete paper trail. GRASS ALWAYS GREENER SIDE bc, least enforceable way. (15+) like kids know rights, never even made OT rate got first real job. Thank you, that’s I’ve saying. That’s study shows — **airborne droplets**. literally nobody called “airborne pathogen doesn’t need water spread” you. here, US. 20 years never spent less two hours day commute - it'd twice that, two hours *each way*. that's considered *normal* people living here.

Wasting 4h+ day pretty much shaped life. Wake 6am get office around 8, leave near 5pm get home right 7 (or 8 heavy commute days), figure fuck even little left day. wanted sleep healthy 8h I'd go bed 10pm, rarely happened.

I miss office ways I'm going back one without ridiculous (and unwarranted) raise, I'd spend moving somewhere ridiculously overpriced that's 10min away it. J&amp;J vaccine might safer option USA. course definitely disclose medicine allergies. I'll tell wife 😝 actually like co-worker~~s~~ *friends* ~~also personal level~~, go drinking eating them?

Just move things around little yes, sounds silly. sounds kinda like: ""Your telling friends work real friends, something?""

Aside potentially spreading known disease, there's nothing wrong that. friends people work like. ask would friends without stuck circumstance. people friendly work livelihood depends they're seen ""team player"".

Have made friends like previous jobs? many still keep touch with? bit critical thinking prevents lot mix ups. one levels, link below, co-worker friends? (It relates school, think still wish was. 0 deaths COVID would dream them. 25 I’m this! think perma WFH especially depressing age range us single, kids, live alone. Work area socialization self-realization. feel extremely deprived ever since went full WFH. Every social sphere cancelled well, nights-out, parties, hobby groups etc more. going talk then? going find people date? sustainable young adults? want hybrid bad, work financial info HIPPA info. see happening risk involved. variants immuno escape variants hit probability even already covid that's say vaccine effective. comment made realize commuting year costs 14 days life, we're going 80m drive per day @ 261 working days / yr (if math right). holy crap. that's one way put perspective  Productivity WAY better. I've told friends family hopefully hard stop employer let continue working home. trying also find 1 dose even worked neutralized immune system mRNA could used? Hoarding? recently became available people age group. Yet can''''t get shot anywhereeeee near me... 

If hoarding give 2 shots first donating countries need.

The truth used 160+million shots already. country population 320mil. sure second shots included 160+ mil definitely still vaccinated everyone wants vaccinated yet....

I mean want shot even 1 would fine... now... yea gotten one yet. No. I’ve always doubt numbers. Especially early last year. Bruh literally religious tier bullshit point. time measures don’t work it’s “think much worse could been” “people weren’t right!”

It’s completely irrelevant, works doesn’t. checked carbon monoxide detector recently? granted like time off, best part WFH

&amp;#x200B;

I wake earlier check stuff since commute getting ready worry about. wake time I'm exhausted working out. later day, commute means work little later need issues Yeah that's great sentiment, reality work like that. classroom, force conversation work them. zoom, walk away computer ignore easily. Yeah, that's me, pay rent car. take single express bus work previous roles would walk. agree commuting sucks, chose solve issue living city. Obviously solution everyone, chose address problem. started new job month half lockdown, year still feel like new employee. lack training socialization me, though. Hello like minded individual - ever work somebody like hope eventually figure try blend pretend like minded. ""if enjoy people spend majority waking hours loser"" Reddit really special place I've WFH almost 10 years. travel go office days, absolutely HATE IT! spend hours bland room things could 15 minute phone call email.

On side. cities, would great could stagger prem work try reduce need parking. that's probably wishful thinking.  Someone told mom aren’t going vaccinate kids vaccine potential cause infertility issues given young people. What’s about? sounds like rubbish me. makes much sense treat corporate partner employer. Expenses sacrifices people treat normal exposed really are. website app that? coworker COVID? he/she exhibiting symptoms? amount people want job continue decline every year wages fall behind inflation (i think we’re approaching 70?) 85% thought upper bound figure herd immunity natural immunity infection still thing. Straight up, work customer service get vaccine, quit try demand come back office. even want hybrid schedule. Anything showing face month much.

Is pretentious me? Absolutely. productive took extreme boost started working home &amp; want deal explaining fluorescent lights, cubicles back hallway, complete lack direct sunlight fuck autistic brain. People productive home work, how? I'm terrible getting anything done home. require atmosphere demands productivity. US lost 15 million doses day production screw up. ridiculous idea need optimize ever dose world right global ist/ anti donny propaganda. 40 million shots 20 million vaccinations worth BILLIONS unvaxxed. nothing. past year leaders mocking US handling pandemic. Remember Merkel pandemic ""golden child""? Germany lockdown AGAIN. EU bet big Oxford bet wrong. US's fault. f'ed want blame orange one. Weak company affectively removed managers structure tho still levels basically promotions submitting report deserve panel know anonymous approve pay/promotion increase. grading system relates pay. 

Seems working alright far. 70% requests improved seems good.

Also separate pay raise automatically year based inflations things everyone per country. mine around 5% increase thought good considering pandemic year. 

We copied system companies interesting options got mine!! Booyah!! every adult wants vaccine get one metric 100% reopening without mask mandates get low hospitalizations then, restrictive reopening waiting everyone wants vaccine fully vaccinated.  Oh fair, talking US. Missed Canada part :B Compensation paycheck.

While correct, compensation defined ""The total cash non-cash payments give employee exchange work business"". Nowhere definition mention expenses incurred due personal choices housing spend time money getting work compensation package remains unchanged, balance I'm giving vs. I'm getting changes.

And ""what giving"" variable equation determine compensation. ""What giving"" involve employer way, shape, form.

Do consider mortgage payment decrease compensation? grocery bill? buttplug purchases? Seeing spent hour today responding reddit comments, teetering bit hypocritical think?  Yup boat. I'm office get little done plus clock day I'm completely done. However I'm home tend actually work and/or available non typical office hours. 

I sincerely hope office sticks 2 days office, 3 days home schedule. Unfortunately I'm position currently say oh hell nah I'm outta would suck would mean adjust spouses work availability finding babysitter two kids would huge pain Yeah last job supposed pay around 5/6k city wage happened they'd hire say oh pay city wage, bosses would keep extra cash.

Technically illegal obviously unethical.  data everything im sure youve seen it. say wife got vaccinated started normal stuff again. booked vacation, go eat, go movies. actually feels amazing stuff again. 

If worried side effects, suggest tylenol. flu like symptoms second dose (moderna) couple tylenol turned mild annoyance. Honestly getting life back would endured 10x side effects. close fucked electoral process is. Yet cost employ employee remained stagnant. wage increases gobbled health care costs. husband manager recent performance reviews asked people whether looking work home, office, hybrid covid think WFH might nice, everyone unanimously said hybrid sounds terrible. Basically ""So two offices set up? thanks"". even one person still working office can't stand working home.

I get wanting work office dead end job one department benefits actually team professional far outweigh benefit commuting. 

You tasks home. can't grow progress. Almost everyone know says thing - feel like I'm stuck. Like life put hold chance work something thing they've always done.

Personally office full time soon reasonable. finally move challenging project I'd need mentorship on. laugh people clients' stupid requests. Friday beers. importantly stop feeling like I'm always kind work. I'm trying embrace positives covid need stay home pros cons really weigh favour WFH. Me. can’t focus home.    I'm morbidly curious AZ going handle pending EUA application US FDA. 

It seems they're going formally submit all, since outright denial EUA would disastrous, PR department going walking tightrope. may decide make public statement all, would saying something itself.  Good 34%.

The rest us who've lives upended carry work like pandemic exist can't wait get back status quo.

-Signed ""essential worker"". socialize they're ""work friends"" actual friends. people would choose socialize me. boss isn’t wrong though, that’s scary part. 110% unintended effects. don’t think unintended consequences lack human interaction, somehow think everything would status quo normal. 

We won’t notice happening months, even year in. may notice years time goes people longer put name face. people show faces around coworkers bosses develop closer relationships course time. relationship going “arms distance” comparatively colleagues able physically present. 

After certain point time someone may even question efficiency company. Labour manpower generally first thing employers go looking cutting costs. weaker relationship management teams work, think chances next person closer relationship? company struggling, people they’re going keep full time wfh force people office, interacting management face face daily? 

My gut tells me, based fact we’re social creatures less socially present are; you’re likely excluded. workplace different. mean delivery driver drop front porch. really sure could high risk.   think people getting confused ""herd immunity"" piece vaccinating *if enough people get it*, unvaccinated people get level ""protection"" secondhand. Clearly ""if enough get it"" piece much lost lol. You’re can, hang :). don’t get people feel extreme urge bragging much weight lost thread that’s clearly sensitive issue suffering weight gain time huge stress. throw nebulous term like collaboration even though wear mask social distance. started going back bogus reason entire team talked via Teams remote. Zero reason office get hear conversations distraction too. One bosses stated something seeing paying ridiculous. efficient vs before. 

&amp;#x200B;

To trust control. would possible Sweden reach low excess mortality rate Finland, considering mid march world shut down, Sweden already high internal spread Finland not. 
 
That misleading claim time Estonia even worse Sweden, yet Estonia present 1,8x less deaths per capita Sweden. Since government change January Estonia used Swedish laissez faire tactic, great ""success"". morons leadership (Reform party) tried copy Swedish end mandatory conscription. forget 50+ year old managing partner(s) think ass-in-chair, in-person work way anything gets done sure huge reason dad stayed pat three kids mortgage. Making change point life could HUGE ramifications made mistake, blame playing safe.

Yup, Dad absolutely *hated* job high school. 2 kids go college, usual expenses etc. even want entertain moving jobs even perfect fit ~15 years clock til retirement. ended retiring early due medical issues (doing much better now) I'm older can't really blame him. freelanced first ~10 years career nice 20s, I've gotten older stability makes big difference. spouse low blood platelets (ITP?) concerns risks MRNA vaccines. complete list adverse reactions concerned about? ethics population-level restrictions vaccinated people result others opting protective behavior (getting vaccinated) seems rather dubious me. Especially considering that, already going use authoritarian measures everyone offered vaccine, use force unvaccinated people get vaccinated, rather forcing vaccinated people wear masks? Gotcha. Yeah, I've taught title 1 schools whole career longstanding issues. I'd hope getting attention would get us support need, find Friday 1000 us district get laid off, likely not. Speaking adult life-threatening allergies knew risk reaction (and ended needing medical care observation hour second dose Pfizer (though walked fine, like 7/10 fine-to-dead scale)), 100% would risk another shot likely worse allergic reaction needed. knew would medical assistance hand, made allergies known, comforted nurses reaction. grateful bad, I'd rather risk allergic reaction risk giving COVID loved one would likely die it. Randomizing blinding controls this. Interesting! person learning last week. I’m glad daughter better though. It’s hard kids! think social interactions important part work place. switched jobs pandemic feel like barely know anyone new job. 

Anyone thinks case straight lying themselves. incontrovertibly true. absolutely zero chance whatsoever could ever develop level camaraderie teammates fully remote vs. face face office, camaraderie among colleagues extremely important thing have, greases wheels business.

Luckily, mean WFH, shouldn't. need 2000 hours year office relationships form. could something like 3 days WFH 2 days office per week probably get best worlds. way person, person. Find places people similar interest start interacting.

There folks met online 90s still send Xmas cards to. 45k actually like 25k taxes. 25k might buy upgrade car. makes sense, hopefully get complete normal college experience back Things miss working office: *nothing*. long productivity continues, cares... learned last year lot us job fine home. ... *not* subsidizing unhealthy ones. Congratulations, that's exciting!!! Except effectiveness two weeks post first shot four.   Basically, no, much say beyond that. Individuals trials asked conform specific exercise regimens (or lack thereof), there's indication exercised (or not) fared worse vaccine. medical advice, course, wisest course action likely listen body -- feel like crap like need rest up, rest. feel like want able exercise, make sure well hydrated leave start feeling unwell. Ah yeah forgot haha. Ok, 2 trades! people suffered much this. I’m Antman  CDC hasn’t updated yet.

Edit: wow literally checked right it’s refreshed. somehow makes sad Quite misleading headline article says half surveyed WFH employees (49%) said would prefer hybrid work arrangement, dividing time office another location. Likewise, 26% said want remain fully remote, 25% wanted return full-time office situation.

Based headline could ""34% quit maintain full-time WFH beyond pandemic"" Hobbies everywhere. Make friends people share interests people obligated around survival.  good thing suits fucking way day. Life get much easier them. still hear teachers crying time though. What's about? Everything controlled for. efficacy compares people got vaccine similar people didn't. They're chosen randomly group. Neither participants people interacting know which. ""double blind randomized controlled trial"" means. I’d rather quit continue work home full time. Here's came from: lie beginning. old job always worked home Friday.

But bunch buds, would hang great bar beach soo chill.

We still work man great hang bros beach.

Maybe post covid again. take couple training/certification classes Zoom since beginning pandemic, suuuuuuucked. Utterly soul-crushing. much sympathetic kids hatred remote learning first cert class. 

I also one special needs kid, remote learning completely useless him. He's regressed significantly since remote learning started, despite district promising us repeatedly would considered high priority returning classroom. went hybrid schedule, two days classroom, really remote learning school building- teacher desk computer, kids sit computers allowed leave desks. guess IEP count Corona something. North Division finishes playoffs, assume winner move US rest playoffs, like Raptors need 25k lol beCos teH frEAdumbS! Lol US household median income $68000 2019. 45k single earner lot relatively Dumb people dumb, knew appears places stricter lockdowns tend sharper spikes things open up: see Michigan vs Texas. No, don't. 
Capital region pop densities comparable. answer, want ""go"" office. go closest virtual office. places need available day. employees go? I'm honestly asking. enough good opportunities disaffected employees slide into? I'm quoting published Pediatric Investigation. [another paper published currently unknown MIS-C/A might follow immunization SARS-CoV-2, need exists define potential entity monitoring adverse event following immunization (AEFI). Eric Staal got traded Montreal like last week opinion sputnik V? Fuck, remember customer support manager previous job expert this. email something, specifically start paper trail, would literally walk back desk talk person avoid creating one. That’s cherry picking data. picking neighbors only? similarity countries emphasized. stay-at-home orders NPIs actually work ? 

or wishful thinking based nothing. That's commendable, every person like friends, scores others never happen.

FYI: *my* scale. :P not? Lmfao lazy office stiffs think hard. 45 minutes like 15 way 30 way out. 90 minutes. disagreeing though ridiculous.  started new job. remote much want. 

I office two weeks hate it. 

Office politics getting involved in. Everyone seems hate job. Etc etc etc. 

I cant get remote fast enough  Well, earnings whether ""hustle 24/7"" really depends industry demand, right better normal job like 5% people. Problem is, way 5% people would consider group quit jobs they're kinda stuck matter much might suck them. mention people straight get laid really choice. go inside? Yes. think it’ll come that. won’t employee door. It’ll panel door scan smart phone verifies allowed entry. wondering what’s availability vaccines travelers USA? gf coming Korea travel visa wondering she’s able get vaccine it’s state dependent resources that. Arizona governor awesome Call dumb entirely missing point. Takes talent.  emergency use authorization, approved yet. ""The bigger concern people supportive push wide spread vaccine passport likely supportive government making mandatory use passport everywhere business making mandatory falls within overton window.""

This pretty big strawman. friends support right business owners choose serve serve people unvaccinated none support government mandating it. actually seen one seriously advocating government hand beyond making tamper-resistant way prove vaccination status paper anyone easily print (at least US).  Bangladesh. 

Given low vaccination rate that’s surprising. show papers basically anything? people wearing masks don’t it, without masks - isn’t hard. think simplifies bit.  We’re still working priority system still less 20% vaccinated (with first dose). haven’t supply early on. Many States kept priority groups well period, believe it’s right step doesn’t even mean slower long demand priority groups match supply, something Canada hasn’t problem with. 

But supply increasing quite bit get past 65 year olds even 60 year olds we’ll probably opening lot general population based ‘essential worker status’. Well weren’t gonna come say came lab. best really dumb trying equate keeping respiratory disease still running rampant crowded venues sexually transmitted disease? Really? cheers geoff that’s problem. Decisions made affect life adversely there’s nothing it.  Vaccine passports redundant time vaccinate enough achieve herd immunity. herd immunity achieved everyone, including vaccinated, allowed restaurants. implement vaccine passports that, well, creating two-tier society. seventy year old nurse able eat restaurant thirty year old non-essential WFH job able to, even wants get vaccinated simply low list. Vaccine passports non-starter. That's getting tend think errs far authoritarian side tastes.

And yes, I've gotten doses Pfizer vaccine. before?  Yeah, I'm pro-vaccine, sounds like would bureaucratic mess rife fraud tech-illiterate people left behind. much better keep vaccinating people roll back restrictions everybody cases drop. WHO!!?!?!?! 


How missing point badly..? 


How clear? Unvaccinated risk vaccinated. someone unlucky enough one extremely small number vaccinated people get COVID vaccination, extremely low risk severe illness dying (there single death category).  


The people people unvaccinated risk unvaccinated people. WANT VACCINCATED, people choose remain unvaccinated deserve protection COVID natural protection vaccinated have. need anyone vaccine passport, mask, preventative measure protect them, accepted risk themselves. Soooooo.... better worse wife literally room tit 1 year olds mouth giving Moderna milk. 

She pumps work thought spiking 3yo sons milk good stuff fit heck it. I’m worried people refusing get vaccine, even job gives paid time it. None coworkers spouses getting vaccine. think even 100 years now, robotics advanced enough that? 300 years? Apparently wrong. unaware hadn’t realized implemented anywhere yet. entirely sure feel state government implementing it. oh thank emperor newsom. wonder recall anything it. lot due reporting backlog caused Easter Holy Week. 7-day average last week still horrific 3k. imagine employers can't mandate vaccines? bullshit reason GAD depression...don’t call “brain disease” US. Jacobson vs. Mass 197 US 11 (1905):

Thankfully closer look Nazi's treated people made revitalize bill rights rip power states. went 2nd day class would learned rest story statement companies hire employees wherever world want correct. Taxes benefits must remitted country employees live (at least case developed countries). article read wfh thing causing issues Europe working living different countries common place. 

Source: Worked California moved Canada last March escape coronavirus. Moved back Canada permanently June, told HR moved job cannot employ country. know three colleagues boat well. tell you. AZ Covid blunders give props Gov right now. Vaccination sites fucking churning. Ducey screwed last year, I'm giving pass man vaccine sites booming. Forcing Jews concentration camps forcing people get vaccines even universe. 

Claims something ""the exact kind reasoning"" bullshit. matters reasoning *about*. 2 weeks   true believe deaths slightly more. Im hoping stay 1k week bound still reporting lag holiday weekend. absolutely. optimist, i’m predicting things might actually return normal near end may. High school athletes may lose potential scholarships/career cause pandemic old? college athletes general allowed older? fact whole athletic system going work? Thats fine. happen choice. want work strictly home, want work strictly office, want hybrid system. 

People allowed choose 3 systems, long productivity good. 

The issue people forced pick one want. breed resentment, lower productivity increase turnover. CDC mandate masks either. recommend abundance caution everything health-related. governors basing mandates CDC recommendations, yeah, probably going years get rid them. like flu shot 2 doses Yes. become issue governor’s refuse even hint endpoint? say “a months longer”, where’s endpoint? Cause sure hell ain’t hearing one. Yes, likely much longer 6 months. Hungary equivalent 10000 us deaths day
 Uk 9000 deaths day peak UK variant wave adjusted US population


They long way go. Michigan hurting? vaccination efforts atrocious? Immunity vaccine measured years decades. Cases looking flat today compared last Tuesday even holiday weekend.  Ha!!! already covid? Reinfection rates astronomically low plaque brain? 
And would vaccine cause it? That’s shot free bill insurance procedure actually injecting arm. Lmao. CNN must desperate. Thanks response. Follow-up question.

So know effective vaccine time testing antibodies? Families afraid free keep kids home. choice send school.

And dying part worth stopping society for, people feeling crappy months worth shutting everything down. Damn that’s it? actually shocking respond even read wrote initial comment, comment responded to. 


The vaccine passports people oppose technology based. that's CLEARLY ""tracking"" comments referring above. go way misunderstand wrote, somehow did... clubs? wanna go totally agree 👍 First, statement really needs clarification, that's case, really think vaccine passports discussed yet countries vaccinating. would really defeat purpose.

For vaccine/testing travel requirements, that's meant said so, I'm really sure people travel country vaccinated yet great idea either. Sorry, what?! vaccines get medically approved, proven safe effective. Yeah supposedly broadband speeds really good enough WFH last decade so, really chance yet. Didn’t Biden want July 4th? wow, labelling anxiety mood ""brain disease"" almost evil way gather cheap clicks panicking people. illegal write headlines. Heck, mine real shitty printer paper instead nice cardstock. reason I'm sure got vaccine instead saline headache got night sore arm. country’s vaccine rollout sped since first doses administered December, recently reaching rolling average three million doses per day. 

Second sentence. I've worked facilities terminate employees get annual flu shot. agree smaller towns, think people want move back smaller towns since family lives (parents, cousins, old friends, etc) well financial benefits.  Well certainly basing timeframe ""if goes well"" yes, factors provide hiccups yes, delay based timeframe supplied. Wealthier people free time hunt appointments money travel places far home get shots. Could be. one likes leave house it’s -20 there’s 2 ft snow ground, warm little good intentions “we going meet outside” turn “well got chilly.” eye exam ensure less likely injure others.  Hmmmm.... you’re right. thousand extra people definitely die due early eligibility expansions, people long desensitized numbers. UK flexing hard us, anyone thinks otherwise hasn’t bothered look death plots.All they’re different give doses to. lockdown talking about? Lockdowns? There's indoor dining movie theaters right now, lockdown? restrictions, likely continue ease full reopen. Supplies ramping feel comparing current situation moot point know hospitals, nursing homes, medical facilities require annual flu shot employment? I've worked hospitals policies. seems working too, deaths hospitilizations six month US, cases, hospitalizations deaths reducing State April new cases rising even pace vaccination claims effective vaccine wait mass testing phase...

When really matters. masks simple easy requirement follow really impact people's lives, there's reason better safe sorry. like keeping schools closed, necessary detrimental, constantly weight pros cons issue. Wearing mask basically downside big upside. sister Covid 2 months tested negative seizures/brain swelling hat intubated. developed pneumonia ventilator. antibiotics worked able get ventilator tracheostomy. pritzker refuses go cdc relation covid, look like people drop ""reccomendations"" time soon. using examples touch CDC reality stupid would follow like gospel Yeah many got least 1 COVID-19 ?? 'another step towards authoritarianism'... Protection life, sure. Going public today neither? Mask up. vaccine good later, get soon can. Well, just. notables strokes, insomnia, nerve root plexus plus others Wondering Texas list ? Try looking somewhere r/politicalhumor national news. Idiot Pfizer vaccine wears closer four months. know basically nothing science question haha. vaccines effective current mutations (UK Brazil) - still similar enough? would natural immunity previous infection original strain more, less, similarly effective compared vaccine immunity? anyone experienced pain heartache migrating data one database 51 others, sounds easier is. PBS You’re one saying 95% protection isn’t enough, me. people view Canada's month 2 behind US grand failure.

I think precisely Canada behind US. personal experience, Canadians seem carry chip shoulder regards US. seems national past-time Canadian redditors extol virtues Canada's superior healthcare system. Canada well, well US definitely irk people. Zoom think around big way while. Tons businesses decided go totally virtual even Covid due savings office. wish could get rid zoom! covid permanent reduction QoL entire world Georgia de-facto reopened quite time restrictions large gatherings eased later week. work never automated. much custom work problem solving individual situations. kind work robots notoriously bad at. know controls automation space. Agreed. knew 3 months in. Schools daycares gonna pandemic mode longer businesses, since kids vaccinated gonna happen awhile, improved ventilation might cards. According information I've seen exactly right. 2 variants working 5 states.

I think Michigan variants attacking much younger people (25-35?) good. seemed compelling interesting read story months back; wonder haven’t heard it? right here! Invaluable reversed could also said... yea he’s dumber What's wild.. went baseball game today. buy "" pods"" bought extra ticket need ended booking wrong section. least pretty breezy there.

Did read entirety Discussion section? clearly stating negative mental health outcomes, impacts, positive test.

I'm making anything up. research paper....  Already kids clue. Nursing 3 month old well pediatrician suggested went it. hypothetical. [Several universities already announced requriements.] Biden encouraging states open vaccinations within weeks, expect lot coming days.  Good know, thank you! didn’t answer question American? Already ages 18 here! Maybe things finally get back normal soon point, draw individual dose straight vital. Vials usually good week spiked (typically). draw doses empty vial. That's vaccines. Even insulin.   locked place right North America..super envious guys south us right researchers analyzed behaviours 200,000 active Canadian Twitter users conducted surveys news consumption habits COVID-19 beliefs Canadians. found use social media relatively exposed US-based information domestic sources information, exposure US news outlets associated misperceptions COVID-19.

Country 330 million source misinformation country 37 million. 12 Better listening bozos like you.. Unless dark skin speak Spanish course, Americans love demanding documents you. I’m holding buying mention infected 100% overlap got vaccine. cases truly 4x confirmed results, that's 130M cases. 80/20 get vaccine, that's extra 10%.  Fortunately it’s spring sports moving outdoors mean usually progressive? Well that’s fucking horrifying. every type misinformation. Good. Others stay home indefinitely don’t want go. interesting read. suspect lumping neurological conditions studies, neurological symptom. Thankfully seem associated important neurological systems. 

That said, doctor. I’m age stay home mom doses February California. work restaurant work kind spaced hours many there- going back working busy hours Friday night. work 10 hours week now. Utah then? Haha Case * increase resting heartrate 100 3 months covid. Prior to, low 70's bpm.

Every jump 130-160 reason.

My doctor says give time. idea next. 

Bloodwork, vitals, ekg normal.

The thing fatigue, went 4-6Hr night sleeper needing 10-12 Hrs sleep night function day.

Im eating clean, losing weight slowly hip surgery coming soon. 

Even going 4 months, feel slow improvement myself. 

I wish better way describe absolutely changed life. Or... get this... maybe shouldn’t nickled dimed even death.

Maybe pay funerals, regardless cause, screwing next kin financially they’re also grieving evil thing do. could white men this, time send death camps Europe really much first wave. already time knew coming. That's densely populated areas suffered much. simply time preventive measures. 

The US, Brazil even UK time, true. literally walking street. local pharmacy I've never even noticed signs said J&amp;J. walked in. one person front me. asked left could get right pharmacist like yeah problem. 10 minutes. 

This first day opened 30+ normal websites told check showing nothing.

Basically I'm saying else fails keep eyes open! Especially love neighborhood big enough ethnic community stores (pharmacies) cater group. They'll let anybody course weird pharmacy nothing English little intimidating lot people. means vaccine you! Companies rely solely consultants usually dumpster fires. fun managing shit show. kinda wish would, enjoyed looking people's faces time. someone nearly face blind, makes easier get away recognizing someone. Also, never understood people masks. keep face warm winter, prevent colds, keep pollen dust out, reduce bad odor like gas pump, ect. also first winter ever cold. downside?  Okay hashtag concerts *cries Canadian* Lockheed’s dick. 

But previously offers TI. 

I’ll get one apply. it’s last option now. 

Nothing else end year I’ll Ti someone else.

But Dallas/Austin nevertheless. miss Texas tbh. won’t trust y’all winter Jack shit. miss food nightlife. 

I moved NYC it’s shit show lol Jesus joke, pharma exec saying reason indigenous pharma capacity lacking due us allowing pharma companies extra patent protection pricing protection order gouge local Canadian pharma customers. I'd say design, accident. I'd also say popular policy, carried number different political administrations.

Once strip whining opposition parties trying capitalize disaster gain legislative power themselves, part media that's philosophically opposed existing gov't scoring points readership really big issue average voter. Trudeau promised 6 million vaccinations end March. happened, some. bumpy ride, nobody interest truth say government done said would do.

That's almost discernible movement approval numbers, Tories bleeding support they're trouble keeping socon's driving traditional PC types coalition.

The Atlantic usually better this. No. Probably trying make conversation. everyone google searched, ask questions, commentary would less fun. lot people better work home. know. truly productive people get work done self discipline dragged back office loafs interrupt work can’t seem get job done can’t socialize unnecessarily. 

I hate hostage social interactions take time away work. Keeping restrictions place “protect” age group that’s negligibly effected virus good. negatives far outweigh positives broad societal outlook.

If didn’t shut schools whatnot H1N1, par COVID worse children, we’re time around either. statistic ridiculous know it. 

The corona situation overwhelming, also fascinating. science-minded medical people world simultaneously disgusted awed beginning. entire world coming together successfully find answer form *multiple* vaccines. 

And find awed disgusted public response amazing solution problem.  Yes seems. don’t get mask mandate still. 3/8 nearly 2,000,000 people Ohio vaccinated less 40 tested positive went hospital. would consider ""weirdly small percentage."" neurological include loss smell? 6 months mine still distorted sometimes completely absent. Fortunate that’s impact knows else may come time. I’m young mild case. Ah interesting. Yeah, sure would qualify Texas Instruments, maybe Lockheed Martin? among would've come point regardless, toll could've much greater (btw January highest Feb). Also, vaccines horizon, might seen people loosening well. thing imminent vaccines enables heady people want get lives back soon way safer manner. vaccines available early process, choice staying safe risking health consequences live life easy selling point. say necessarily. lots overhead gets used times week. suck job wears your. Typically ingredients high cost industries. would proper way here's thing stadium owners might pressured Texas law Gregg Abbott reopen hundred percent capacity. might mean end different Reddit discussion r/politics Thanks much reply. check sub multiple times day looking positive news, FACTS share people life hesitant get shot..&amp; celebrate internet strangers scored their's! 

I doubt data coming. want miss anything could share friends visiting Mexico. Yucatan. far friend's parents (80yr+) got shots. &amp; brother tag teamed line 3 days secure shot. One Canadian friends Yucatan received 1st shot (60yr+). I'm hoping wife 50-59yr range well Mexican friend 30yr+ opportunity get visit. not, want data show safe visit us (w precautions.)

Again..appreciate response active much lately, remember seeing figured random bad apples. think right. starting stink like rot much population California vaccinated then? one thinks pretty careless open then? 

Why feel far political decision medical one? totally agree here. 

we could easily outbreak norovirus infected employee sick shared bathroom still masking everywhere else, sick, putting back mask, touching surface :/

we need paid sick leave force people work sick. masks fix structural work/healthcare problems. always risk, indicators bad risk lag behind ability control things. hospital overrun starts looking like serious possibility, infections already happened. It’s longer avoidable even delayable. last point really key, too. lot people coming take purely political move stave recall. maybe *part* that. 

But recall election’s likely take place *after* June 15th. walks statement back, there’d much political pressure didn’t say anything all. Now, may may enough jeopardize governorship reliably-blue California, fucking would certainly make seat warm.

He’s gotta confident this. like people obligation vaccine passport federal government lol Shame want it. 


Don't shame can't get due supply access issues. They’re limiting attendance now, one night thing. know it’s safe over, regardless typical blather folks fish fry. 

Honestly risk fairly limited one-off. 2020 insanity 2021 looking better month now.

Now need hurry protect teenagers kids variants start take apparently affect much strongly. Absolutely correct they're something identical Serie Bergamo Match became super spreader event. Apply logic Major League Baseball match suspended due coronavirus testing positive tests. Recent example Mets vs. Nationals psychological effect people hesitant wear masks social obligation potentially feeling like don’t need wear mask vaccinated people around aren’t wearing them. whole sub taken Covid deniers  Good, country mandated time off. really understand reference Fukushima either considering like one death, best estimates may two hundred cancer related deaths caused accident. nothing like COVID-19 terms magnitude. Government, tech, leaving California. That’s key shot free, room bill insurance administrative costs.  don’t believe people pay pocket . ton morons medicine. Remember every Dr. House many people basically following biological equivalent ""have tried turning again?"" I'm employer suppose I'm biased, fire someone saying racist sexist things employees, still blasted us glassdoor. we're talking ""not-quite-woke-enough"" levels racism/sexism: definitely warranted termination (especially since already warning). 

I also someone think working 30 hours week claim ""60+ hour weeks"" glassdoor review. let go making 6 figures, handle amount work junior counterparts, blamed everyone everything else anytime brought (this tell-tale sign someone work out: bring issue, never reflect might contribute solution).

And I'm completely biased: negative reviews fairly accurate I'm proud mismanaged folks. Kids probably start getting vaccinated summer. trials speak. I’ve literally never wanted meet someone worked remotely pre pandemic. Don’t understand all. Canada lol mean tbh, could put astronauts sun fine. Getting back would tricky though. need FANG tho since I’m hardware circuit board type mechanical. 

I’m learning code gets gonna take time. Toyota know don’t auto industry. like cars know working car place quickest way like cars Yeah, 1 2 days, 10 day work home Isolation period, 10 day Quarantine, case Covid... 10 days family members get sick. know anymore. Imagine people caught abusing though. companies require flu test covid test...what mess. Federal vaccination sites (not state run pharmacy sites) ask photo id, insurance bs.  Well they'll get lot clicks. Fukushima bit strange comparison. happened Japan definitely tragic, one person died immediately estimates total deaths reach somewhere around 2,000. 

Using comparison, Brazil seeing decades worth Fukushima deaths daily! people aren’t obsessed news. Don’t be—it’s mentally difficult past year. three months November January busier we’ve ever been, we’d talk family members, gut-wrenching. funeral directors suffered terribly well—I know least half dozen regular clients gotten COVID. One partners died it. It’s interesting job talk about, pandemic made personal way should’ve expected didn’t process reality. yes, see original comment, eventually get used using dark humor coping mechanism. course study comes 2000 dollars 2 years 100% true. mass vaccine sites run vaccine week ago stop. federal government proceeded release massive shipment days ago presser provinces holding million doses back whatever. Absolute numbskull politicians charge federal response. variants wild card. I'd super optimistic them. I'm guessing Canada's opening fully well next year. I've read probably combination rapid lowering restrictions, already low immunity levels, variants. month ago pretty much restrictions lifted except mask mandate. School sports especially driving cases state bowed ""let play"" stuff. also UK variant comes shown spread much easier children. Since done relatively well throughout pandemic meant less people natural immunity ones avoided getting COVID thanks restrictions common sense getting like weeks could get vaccine. even said something like year ago, pandemics starting Brazil. said that, former captain army, specialization killing, healing. Here's article want skip hit refresh vaccine site like game hungry hungry hippos! It’s complicated situation agree I’ve run teams programmers countries considered “employees” even though treated contractors 

My concern coming covid mess benefits working remotely matter time consultants running around trying outsource jobs again. unlike last time sent customer service seas time programmers engineers. 3% first dose. meme vaccine. probably going revaccinate people later real vaccine. EU countries older population though. look cases deaths better metric.  Heck. I'd $100  That's awesome, thank contribution! :) someone unlikely go follow rules vaccinated people don’t wear masks, unlikely follow rules vaccinated people forced science. meme Americans liars frauds completely false. see word “jab” “stab” describe “shot” “vaccinated” downvote. Don’t compare piblic school system clerk walmart getting data supervision funny vermont released plan earlier today uhhh strange one. plan reopen july 4th masks still required well expensive me. need car lived city. added costs things cars need. 

Also, lot social competition. teens, prepare Gucci slides expensive sports requested. yes, teen die buy him/her. cases flattening good sign. Deaths lagging indicator watch closely. Deaths decline positivity rates positive cases declining. cases plateau couple days, fully expect begin decline soon. I’m pretty sure official guidance changing soon mask wearing vaccinated. Lmao never going ""done"" covid. F5 gem. read article disorders lumped together term like brain disease. It’s poor journalism  seems like cool job. Well dunno cool right word I'm jealous. HCWs still using N95 KN95 masks. still work fine. know increases due, part, highly transmissible variants, closely monitoring,"" Walensky said Monday White House COVID-19 Response Team briefing. virus linked high school wrestling tournaments Florida last December 38 people tested positive, according CDC report published January. ""We're finding team sports kids getting together, obviously many without masks, driving it, rather classroom spread,"" Fauci told ABC's George Stephanopoulos Tuesday ""Good Morning America."" Nice false equivalency though. /r/enlightenedcentrism ever considered maybe mom enjoyed it? Teachers getting another group that's teachers sign up..my friends teacher J&amp;J (one shot vaccine) cause teachers getting J&amp;J.  ""people"" get triggered enough wear mask actually vote candidate would never voted governors anyway. really agree last sentence. It’s mainly timing makes agree decision implement vaccine passports.

If implement system like many people chance become fully vaccinated lead inequity. many class, racial, age disparities vaccination rates caused differences access barring people without access traveling participating society right.

If wait implement vaccines widely available time hospitalizations rare regardless system wouldn’t worth economic cost. especially true Israel guide overall transmission collapses. Damn, I've local control covid restriction since know best local communities. However, wish federal (US) government pressure states keep in-line CDC guidlines. Look. US good anything it’s pharmaceutical research development. spend trillions healthcare country guess it’s silver lining atrocious healthcare costs endure. yah, there’s guess. beat saying this. probably also recommend masks elderly next winter limit flu since numbers year. UC San Diego used UC La Jolla changed La Jolla nationally famous racism official guidance changing soon anyways. wouldn’t count places except certain private businesses maybe still requiring end May. definitely bothers them, stop kidding yourself. 2 young cousins middle school cried multiple times going on. Putting shields desks acting like everyone leper, ridiculous kids barely affected.

Masks allow full human communication, anyone says otherwise simply idiot. teachers chance fully vaccinated, time masks go classrooms. comment mean unhelpful. child hospitalized respiratory distress would like avoid future situations needs supplemental oxygen. Please think post comments future. Oh gosh... vaccines issued emergency use authorization much faster process, article. Better yet, here's information vaccines [FDA real! thought CA &amp; NY going fully reopen sometime fall, hopefully Cuomo follow. love that’s science yet. love sub optimistic, too. relaying I’m hearing news, articles, podcasts etc. think sub needs patient everything progresses year. P1 good evading vaccines SA variant. OTOH P1 good transmission, likely dangerous vanilla. Pfizer &amp; J&amp;J overwhelmingly decreased efficacy due HIV+ participants. NVX showed substantial decease based 150/4000+ medically-stable HIV+ individuals - can't determine poor sets results were, overall efficacy &lt;49% enough get past SAPHRA. far able check, sure results HIV+ individuals much poorer given single one immunocompromised. 

That said, argument applies - I'm letting people HIV offered something either dangerous potentially danger whilst HIV- recipients receive something same. Constitutional lawyer says take first offer, Pfizer J&amp;J - people HIV remain understandable skittish deserve choice anyone does. pick, young'uns pick (between two excellent vaccines - even made someone decides go broke take Moderna. swear. That's death rate despite vaccinations, social distancing, reduced restaurants, mask usage.

Covid killed Americans basically anything short civil war, multiple years.

You talk car accidents we've literally spent countless billions dollars road safety instituted tons regulations aimed preventing it. workplace accidents, used build roads, bridges, skyscrapers ima fraction time money today. We've added tons regulations name safety.

The restaurants already reduced capacity thets already true right now. They're trying figure ways open sooner actual end pandemic. Unless measurable risk healthcare system overwhelmed, scientific reason keep draconian lockdowns place.

Prove wrong. absurd thing one questions this, shows lack critical thinking. Like friend literally judged someone walking street mask, mask eating apple, also goes dates restaurants eats food across table complete strangers (with mask.) Like seriously mask thing mostly way dividing people bickering complete nonsense, everyone see that?  That's I'm at. someone refuses get vaccinated everyone easily access vaccine, really could give fuck happens THEM. care enough anti-vaxxers get new variant vaccines work on. Statnews also article this: months diagnosed Covid-19, 1 3 patients also experienced psychiatric neurological illness, mostly mood disorders also strokes dementia, large new study shows.

About 1 8 patients (12.8%) diagnosed first time illness, commonly anxiety depression. Compared control groups people flu non-Covid respiratory infections, first-ever neuropsychiatric diagnoses almost twice high.

The study, published Tuesday Lancet Psychiatry, used real-world health data millions people gauge incidence 13 brain disorders. Anxiety, mood, substance use disorders common, researchers also found worrying, lower, rates serious neurological complications, especially patients severely ill Covid-19. Covid-19 patients, 0.6% developed brain hemorrhage, 2.1% ischemic stroke, 0.7% dementia.

Oh dear god this. bad day can’t really leave behind. helps commute wasn’t bad. Maybe 40 minutes walking + train. Friendo, parent diabetic 10 years still understand carbohydrates count ""sugar.""  Infertility rumor going around since polio vaccine. It’s never happened. “altering DNA” something ignorant people misinterpret hearing mRNA.

The *virus itself* mRNA tricks body making copies virus. It’s get sick. change DNA? No! 

Scientists take mRNA above, cut little tiny piece (the spike part) make copies, coat fat (lipid) make last longer, inject it. body makes copies spike *instead whole virus like above*. Nothing changes DNA. COVID third-leading cause death 2020 0 vaccines.

For reason think hundreds millions doses 95% effective vaccine might drop list. read article then.

The study talking neurological psychiatric diagnoses psychiatric diagnoses. includes ischemic stroke. Mexico know quite folks taken 'vacation' various cities US, mostly border states like CA &amp; TX show show ID good go! look doses available, good well. careful gets customs, can't say going take vaccine else denied entry.   feel calling 'a chemical imbalance'?  stops someone wearing mask vaccinated? suggesting use honor system? tell experience huge subset would lie never wear mask again. still get benefit, like would vaccine passports. much money cost government institute system need talk back, really purpose could possibly have?

I'm genuinely asking why? Keeping mind easier, cheaper, likely already happening tracked via phones can't that.  Yes, private businesses government agencies want operate safely? Also helps boost vaccine uptake among unsure, making herd immunity easily achievable. going see spike holiday weekend wait longer couple days.  Gottlieb added enough immunity general population prevent fourth wave virus. found where? Hey man, feeling okay cough? Might want get tested. think weird drinking cow’s milk isn’t, might want think minute.

Hell, probably healthier. God Bless President Joseph R. Biden Jr. check state eligibility requirements. flew last weekend (already covid + 1st shot fortunately) airport logic hilarious. tell people keep 6 feet mask second step property, completely pack flights full. everyone gets remove mask time complementary food drink. after? Cause would explain mask thing. Why? months showing much better states vaccine rollout are. population small numbers start going collateral.

Cases seem rising current restrictions likely enough flatten us vaccines .. whenever come. state think asking occupation recipient see figure totally accurate. ask husband.  Shhh you’re ruining story. 

2 weeks maybe? ""ITS BIG DEAL! KILLS 2% PEOPLE GET IT!!!""

This reason I'm wearing mask. kept kids home school. I'm going beach, restaurants, crowded places. know lasting implications thing. Sure, mood disorders anxiety may seem like big deal else pop up? I'd rather wear mask willingly take away ""my freedom"" people see face (I guess???) potentially heart, lung brain issues, even they're temporary. “You’ve got move-it move-it!” nurses say, move it, quicker aches cramps go away! 

Get moving arm circles couple push-ups! Give area light massage try warm compress. Feel better soon! NY ask ID Insurance. Early proof eligibility required too. everyone eligible. ridiculous. everyone gotten chance get vaccinated open up! masks enough UK/SA variants, upgrade respirators soon covid permanent  Radically different experience mine CA. got asked name appointment proof residency area. went vaccinated kind headline that? Using reference Japanese disaster compare Brazil US. Eesh, downvoting try put numbers proper context. Michigan surging news, potentially coming is. Let's clear. duck scenario. disaster state greatest economy country. sure know you’re talking about? $100 buys unlimited CTA pass Chicago. workplace full time WFH fall winter, we've returned office March, currently allowing employees work 2 days home. hybrid approach pretty good suppose. makes coming work little tolerable. point expect go back full time office though. get job, need apply one. Hybrid sounds nice don’t see panning multiple reasons. 

1.	Company still expense maintain office
2.	Company limited hiring local huge pro remote work open hiring pool
3.	If allow fully remote hires you’ll likely eventually reach point employees living near HQ what’s point?
4.	You get sets cons remote person
5.	There likely weird unspoken feeling you’re expected come time anyway Ah okay way. won’t get active choice one get, though. effectively deny get one want. I’ve read deny vaccine, basically get put end queue you’ll get chance again. Everyone preferences work best Le sides. favorite line side 99% damage. Thank you! know could affect mine cycle kinda weird I'll reading closely. I'm suburbs outside NYC, imagine there's probably slightly less compliance we're still pretty good. think I've seen anyone wearing mask indoors entire time. did, think “dominant” CDC means B117 makes plurality positive covid tests sequenced weekly, necessarily majority. haven’t released report proportions variants since mid March: Like, promised short day Friday 2 hour pizza lunch, I'll show maybe* every Friday. one summer cummuting 1.5 hours way internship NYC good job, great pay, lots career potential decided stay it. math cost transit, travel time, food (if didnt bring lunch me), making pittance would worth. swore never take job long cummute. Never anything longer 45 minutes. personal professional life much better it. 

I make career sacrifices taking jobs qualified would bumped pay, always worth it. work live rather live work great. 

With WFH becoming common, may re-evaluate things, field really conducive 100% WFH. said, I've hybrid (WFH one day, office another, go late half day office times) last year NEVER going back. actually get see spend time family help around house. dream come true. place tried headhunt last year didnt sort WFH flexible working scheme almost chance getting me. hand, can't wait get back. mental health seriously suffering home.

Equally, think hybrid schedules accessible want them. charitable version think implementing kind restrictions send message people stay inside. maybe hope one gets idea go meeting park going back someone's home.

Someone ago called abstinence-only pandemic policy instead giving people risk mitigation tools. That's pretty spot on. client, would fired focus clock work. That's truth. 😅 boy, that's cute.

Have fun insulting strangers internet. Well good thing least J&amp;J, Pfizer/Biotech, Moderna data shows much better neutralization variants Sinopharm Vaccine made China. Excuse me? simple neutral question based genuine curiosity. attachment vaccine natural wonder governments handle this. Please jump conclusions. apartment buildings winter rubber hats folks! course anything possible, straight along lines opposing conspiracy theory financially motivated powered Pharma's stand make substantial money get ""Global"" massive market AZ (Initially pre-sales Pfizer Moderno combined twice like damaging also impossible prove get real information pretty pointless even discuss unless want go talk conspiracy theories someone.

Well, based today’s news, suppose need rubber headgear. Uh happens regularly non work friends to. Friends come go that's life mean ""real"" friends. Yep this, reason soon pandemic hit everyone “2-3 hours commuting time day!!” literal worst thing world! commute like 15 minutes fav time days usually, nice able stop coffee shop, listen podcast, leave house end day celebration time. Really helps disconnect office.

I always feel tethered now, even tho set hard boundaries ect. don’t function I’m tired people stating, “wfh mandatory forever!”.

Maybe family live depressing. Ok quit, I'll take job!  specifically conversion boss performance reviews year.

Like, 34% willing find new job interesting, there's even people really positions pack leave new company this, despite clearly wanting work home least part time. trying smart this? emotionally attached product? 

Yes another vaccine also proves unsafe people would also stop using that. finally going back work? That's relevant question here. Yeah enjoy entry level grunt work rest life. required office 3 days per week 12 hours means I'm 530am work 7. 12 *work* hours means I'm leaving 8pm home perhaps 9pm. scenario daughter asleep left, asleep got home. 3 days 43% total week.

When work home, absolutely interact daughter. make breakfast every morning. get give bath every night. get take play go walk evening. that, I've last year able go *every* doctor appointment, I've first steps, first words, built connection absolutely would able metaphorically tied desk office. 

No disrespect, comment completely ridiculous.  never worked home, seems like one “Can’t put genie back bottle” type situations.

Ok obviously never really worked team really poor team member. stop bothering.  got Pfizer shot- might actually last painful shot I’ve ever didn’t feel anything can't tell means efficacy poor want figure different strains causing it, sequence every case start figure good idea.

This really interesting one watch, fundamentally different every vaccine including spike nucleocapsid proteins. could fail spectacularly become best vaccine have. I'd probably say first likely, it'll extremely good find out. One meme saw way back like ""tired looking bad screen, can't wait go home look good screen""

Now they're screen.   actually **weekly** figures April 4, Britain recorded four deaths per million people - making fourth-lowest fatalities Europe, behind Norway, Denmark Portugal.

All said, response? person I'm responding (and they're far alone) acting like CDC nefarious plan NEVER recommend return normal, that's absolute lunacy. insane think doctors scientists got living someday might become talking head TV they'd value brief fame everything spent life studying. they'd throw away credibility torture people forcing live lock downs advocated for, simply allows stay ""relevant."" put quotes people believe nonsense actually think accomplished doctors scientists care bullshit 18 year old kids care about: likes, shares, moment spotlight, etc. don't. 

I mean, absolutely bat shit crazy. received less vaccines per cap. Simple that. quarantined 2 weeks someone's contact diary, either lose 2 weeks pay WFH, thought since laptop could work remotely...but 99% work troubleshoot avionics ideas. actually tried fighting asking negative test would sufficient, HR said no. ""worked home"" realized mistake kept asking take test supervisor told stay home anyways since HR initially made big deal test insufficient. stop calling everyday, told kick sand. Guess 2 weeks, absolutely nothing got paid nothing kept 2 weeks emergency leave never used never got Covid. wanted take test returned, argued 2 weeks sufficient enough clear CDC ""recommendation"" exactly that, recommendation company Covid policy changed returned.

I take day week WFH, take advantage like coming work job sit around shaking mouse every minutes appear available next room Xbox lake family. would suspicious two countries show interest traveling 80 years ago. crazy. employer realized could move smaller office save ton rent. we're moving hybrid schedule. 

I really like working home, full time sucks. me, drove crazy seeing anyone. motivation, concentrate, suicidal thoughts daily. Fuck working home.  like didn’t respond question would show going physical workplace would cost extra. utilities, spend upwards 100$ EXTRA per month you’re working home? How? never use utilities before? Never internet heating?

If rent increased, that’s point working office since rent increased anyway. I'm actively looking fully remote jobs now, knowing employer switch fully remote, lol. 

Screw system, play win it. Yep. remote work = forced get apartment closer offce rent sky high forced commute 2hours everyday. 2 hours extra life give good reason Meanwhile, employer (healthcare provider mind you) took away WFH options last month forced back office. We're admin, clinical. Productivity gone WFH yet still forced back office. weekly teams meetings fat cats visibly either home vacation homes working remotely.. nice rub salt wound. Y'all know anyone hiring? Haha dad one employer retired massive pension. understands world longer exists doesn’t understand hop around. lot people personality disorders problem, people know far I'm aware one else talking connection mast cells blood clots yet. Mast cells produce dozens, maybe hundreds mediators. interested mast cell activation implicated Covid [this fantastic.  me. know well think I'm diligent home office. office environment far better keeping focused, commute short. Also, receive work calls cell phone kinda gets skin. really value keeping work home separate.

On hand, sleep bit later exercise frequently working home, I'll sticking hybrid approach going forward. extremely fortunate ability make call myself.  Me, hated working home. called manager crying return back work. honestly understand going back office would help literally way.

Your issue going office, issue lack socialising. Nobody goes office chill mates. go that, able things open back little.

You're basically saying ""I seeing anyone, I'd rather go somewhere awful people want really able talk anyway."" understanding Pfizer providing manufacturing expertise Biontech provided tech, assume biontech's plant got help someone since never made vaccine scale before? Absolutely not. I've got social anxiety ironically enough that's entire reason want go back working office. Precisely I'm even risk simply disappearing head compared extroverts anxiety.

A hybrid schedule best though. China license BioNTech (Pfizer) vaccine. AFAIK never made any, everything needed so, including international rights. quantity might beyond today, industrial ability change fast want. Great mate! Enjoy life!!! Issues specific jobs.

To I'd add:

Get enough sleep.

Get enough vitamin D. people don't. 500 IU per day 5,000 IU per week can't hurt, might help. live where? city thats already untennable housing crisis? act like people want ridiculous commutes cost hudreds dollars month similar experience. team already worked multiple offices, transitioning working home easy. experienced employees is.

However, training newbies very, difficult remotely. industry get new batch college grads every year. much harder train them, answer questions, help troubleshoot, overhear something explaining one person. They’re young connecting fine online, connecting random managers senior staff like would office.

Workload balancing difficult getting emailed requests directed me, new teammate I’m name comes mind sending email. people less patient new teammate can’t see she’s trying learning, feels like she’s slow them. Youtube good source. legitimate academic journal. think social interactions important part work place. 

I completely agree, incompatible remote work. I've working remotely 10 years, several different jobs, I've always enjoyed social aspect jobs. good team right culture still get know other, work well together, fun chat video calls. something built company culture. need us back offices commuters fly planes us again. ""and here's 2 week notice"" say labor needed another robots' labor skill don’t see reopen everything expect people still comply mask mandate. That’s kind sending opposite messages would expect end deciding lift mask mandate time. place might see continue schools children vaccinated. work home find children distraction. love seeing though commuted 4 hours day... they're going drag in....it ain't happening. 1. He's bit doomy taken seriously.
2. charged sexual misconduct point? Yeah, charge dropped...but pessimistic side thinks used power get it. Last April bought used Jeep past year I've put 1,200 miles it...during pre-covid would drive 1,200 month. math 15 mpg means I've saved nearly $3,000 gas costs *and* gained back 260 extra hours personal time previously spent commuting. believe that. &amp;#x200B;

what start showing AWAY games big screen.

have vax night, make concessions.

maybe give ticket future game done.

&amp;#x200B;

half ballparks idle given night. Yeah. I’m wishing office I’m severely depressed lonely. Tbh think would love remote work could see friends family like regular though. arm. Infectious diseases still exist. full year WFH I'm glad going Wednesday Friday. want come this. mean, sure people introverted like people, fair ... understand either 🤪   local/city subs worst this. Look gem year group people playing volleyball outside who? assuming everyone thriving social networks outside jobs. lot people make friends work struggle make friends elsewhere. vaccine orders magnitude better COVID, prevent getting booster shot later.

AZ appear good compared basically vaccine. still offers nearly full protection hospitalization even scary strains.  general, meetings tend least productive part project, large margin. 

I disagree whatsoever Often achieving little clear value, frequently tying work many, many people need 

Still agreement latter half, much first half. least us, meetings defined values crucial. Could done different way? Sure, would become game telephone delays.

I'm software dev. work pretty massive company. team runs short cadence, almost two dozen apps, getting requests different platforms enhance update them. 

Part Agile development quick feedback loop sponsors work progresses. using basic SCRUM methodology means least meetings:

- Sprint review sponsors

- Retro team

- Planning team potential sprint specific outside resources

- Grooming backlogs work ready next planning session

- possible meetings teams/security/vendors complete sprint's work, align expectations next sprint

These core meetings _happen every single iteration_ within SCRUM. Iterations anywhere 1 - 4 weeks depending company/team. Sometimes get lucky meetings take 30 minutes, sometimes lot discuss take hour each.

But cramming one day, dreadful sounds, means free rest week distractions. plan delayed distracted two days later again. stop context switching resulted huge boon us. raw productivity, mentally team much less stressed could focus/streamline work much better. none us _only_ meetings. things top this, minimizing meetings one specific thing single day really help. advice used ""stick company 20 yrs retire""

now advice ""climb ladder jumping companies every couple years""

companies deciding ""fuck training people, we'll hire company's employee pools, pay more.""

this causes new employees left dust bottom, well stagnating wages article study nothing that. NFL games year anywhere close full capacity pretty easy poorly built older home. things zero insulation leaky doors windows. usually older less energy efficient AC. less efficient everything really. mention think many electronics people have. mind going office twice week, I'll damned drag daily commute expense hassle associated anymore.

Fortunately, office going permanent 'in-office optional' setup, even downsized space lease building expectation us office time. rest job *meh*, really love spend much time behind wheel sit ass seat somewhere really necessary. ""Yeah, need ticket work""

""No, work outside scope ticket"" question’s answered. everything’s grand conspiracy silence you. Less 10% households itemize now. Although ending pandemic would global effort, US could potentially vaccinate 200mil people July 4th. Many said summer could resemble normal US look Israel guidance things roll out. 

Do think it’s ignorant hope US part domino effect countries starting open normal starting early summer? think state enforcement mask mandate. Yep, thinking setup tent central park, time square, metro terminals, anywhere lots people travel through. 

If someone decides want vaccine take minutes find place go get it. driving also stressful experience many people whether they're aware boat, might’ve even worse tbh. semester &amp; half left graduated, going top 30 school w straight A’s stem major. let students pass/fail classes Spring anything short would’ve dropped GPA, credited everything. fall, already job lined danger failing classes completing things every reason expect Pfizer approved month so. 6 month study completed, required go EUA full authorization. suppose data might show something funny, doubt - nothing shown millions got shot already, something I'd expect independent data monitors stepped in. said would fired creating hostile work environment. Yes, let's fire guy actually work everyone else to. Smart idea Different strokes suppose. I'm opposite extreme. need hours morning workout, shower, make nice breakfast, watch news, etc. even think work lol. Good, I’m going back school fall hope university attend requirement. never ""safe enough"" people like you. keep moving goal posts ""2 months"" nothing left reopen. better yet, go hide rest life, rest us get it. Deal? Something deductable taxes isnt cracked anymore guven itemizations longer even clear standard deductable. People thinking government gets money free. comes taxes. large amount tax comes working class.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  law saying vaccinated people exempt mask-wearing get technical. Pretty much here. Gaining hours life back savings commuting great, I’m way, way alone pre-pandemic. Working home, exercising apartment, coffee walks coworkers, etc.

Some sort optional hybrid attendance best me. Go whenever feel like it, don’t go don’t, one cares whim follow given day. Well Joe bit everyman thing going on. Ultraliberal granola city, county, state politicians Seattle?  generally much surprised one two.

I'll bet congress take Amtrak city bus make wedding time. jobs require office pay much one wants them. Thank Dr Frieden great interviews pandemic. 

There several locations times even without anti-virus restriction policies, cases dropped precipitously. Dakotas, Iowa, much mid-West January/February example. think likely explanation drop transmission critical mass individuals already infected transmission slows precipitously new cases go down? possible individuals may antibody-negative immune, contributing decreased transmission? explanations might account drops transmission? Quickest slowest year entire life time. fucking whirlwind, there's conclusive evidence can't carry spread virus even vaccinated

I've read studies suggesting stop spread. know it'll take confirmed. don’t need 40% fast food population. need employees per store. I’m tired this. good one. I'm trying argument... time read, curious says spike friends hiring manager says leaving company within 7 years 5 years position see drive wanting better yourself. making looking ambitious I'm literally quitting remote job soon safe return offices. kids, can't stand home day. lack communication makes work least 2 times difficult. Lol right? hilarious see people whining go back office. Fine. Quit find remote job. know signed for. worked remotely three years gave office job. Go ahead quit many people work right would love job. understand resentment comes - MIL overworked full-time worker bakery gets slightly minimum wage, can't bring temp help people reluctant go unemployment, yet still risk ass every day COVID pay taxes that, least mind, go towards said unemployment. resentment quite widespread, tell.

 There's real risk big cultural clash blue collar workers sat parts pandemic unemployment blue collar workers didn't. join club take class?   Yeah normal times kids would school anyway.

Also people want cute baby decide kid forget kids needs lot attention care grow quite fast really annoying sometimes, parents cant live normal life anymore. job likely send us back permanently vaccine rolls enough people.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* A) Whitty TV last month talking risks. exactly great ""Cover Up"" operation openly talking TV.

B) vaccinations AZ mainly gone older people, seem less prone getting clots. - 35% get option first place.
- 35% allowed speak without management overhear conversations.
- 10% laid ""covid"" Irrespective whether job impacted actual pandemic. QA Engineer (and remote 10 years). Sounds like sessions right. Meetings necessary evil, also need facilitated properly wasting time needed also stick scope. 

Properly done, good dev team flesh stories coding bugs catch later attend meetings understand acceptance criteria, regression risks potential issues ;) think vaccine ever created deployed quickly CV-19 vaccines have. Right EU suffering Sanofi/GSK vaccine failed Oxford/AZ vaccine produced sufficient quantities places really reliable supply Pfizer facilities set basis available export get it.

However, new months:

- Pfizer's production step up.
- Moderna become available quantity.
- J&amp;J become available quantity.
- AZ's production become less shaky.
- Novavax approved go mass production (UK).
- Valneva continue going approval process towards production (UK)

The last two EU, like we're going vaccine parties UK. everybody jabs whatever they're getting they're done barring need booster shots supplies available export modulo commitment already made government donate excess we've ordered developing nations. used spend 20 min hour lunch driving home eat wife. time eat go bike ride. able get outside day life-changing. think also hard new people start remote. get much better training done new guys person. One friends nurse says they've finding people case Covid stronger reactions first vaccine second many cases, may happened you. Hope second less rough. take vaccine, say chicken pox, measles, etc. show lot caution ask friends family vaccinated. time, virtually vaccine taken 100% people. words, situation vaccinated norm always case always considered acceptable. longer case? hilarious absurdity american urban planning like 10% take itemized deductions. I'd say fairly hard hit.  need come back office, even part-time, employees said expect changes. example, they’d want employer cover commuting costs

I agree employers really helping commuting costs last decades. think sort flat stipend per employee makes sense.

Good luck getting happen though. Probably lot companies going start saving money office rent downsizing, I’m skeptical they’ll put here. hope I’m wrong. large group, maybe 50%, deeply want return office.

Imagine much better would be. annoying people deeply love office, gossiping each-other, interrupting each-other, etc. go office thing.

Everybody else hates stuff go office get roped BS.

The old way things everybody office subjected attention-needing extroverts. own. time = money 

and less time thats pay cut... least decrease quality life someone hasn’t day due pandemic, working OT since whole mess began, someone help would ever want go work? 

I would kill WFH gig. sadly, need people administering vaccines ever. can’t home.  virus control see people outside work. Work main place social interactions. Right. Lets get ASU board now. what's source killing way kids? keep hearing seen statistic support yet Better 1000 right here. Plus, would folks think coworkers would even socialize feel like going office? would little cohesion camaraderie. would designated desk, computer? natural progression is, employees work anywhere, hire anywhere. logistics much messier people willing consider. spent hour week [reading news] 500 hours learning spanish, informed enough, know spanish.

I guess word d00m scr*lling forbidden autmod love Covid exact reason. Covid, WFH really ""treat elites"" rest us peons required work office. Work home Friday? Sure - 8 office.

Now last year plus proven need go office. easily giving 10 hours week before. 100% aware jobs already outsourced, everyone works home, means even jobs outsourced. pandemic, almost every company offices standard. companies realize larger proportion employees productive remotely, means jobs outsourced. I’m also concerned lot college/high school students don’t yet job; may face increasingly competitive situations get paid less costs living skyrocketing. can’t tell covid made people crazy brought crazy previously... 

¿por que los dos? perhaps also survey companies. those, ~60% wanted work least partially home option go office occasionally. remaining 40% wanted work remotely full time. Literally one wanted work office full time. I've similar conversation; got 2% raise 2 years. told supervisor inflation gone 2.5% past two years, said ""it could nothing"" well.

So started job hunt. I'm union I've getting COLA adjustments past 2 years, negotiations. 

Turned onto organized labor sure, expect 30 years private, non-union employment. Even get rough side effects, they'll pass soon enough get life. someone got rocked dose 1 still counting days till get dose 2 cause wanna done this. stupid rule ever. MP screw loose. got 2nd shot return two weeks. enjoyed year WFH, oh well. I'm going quit it, I'll miss it. $232 pre-pandemic, that’s whopping half hour train ride. pay $426 I'm Rice vast majority students gotten least first shot provide anecdote, 90% building WFH still since last March, never coming back site. able WFH last March-May, required back full time since then. Why? manager (and manager higher up) said group to, even though easily 75-90% job remotely. explanation ""the group needs site"". Granted, sometimes work machines technicians, day work computer desk (I'm engineer) easily done home. ""special circumstances"" allowed like pulling teeth try get anything approved. holidays finally able get WFH time much productive office even minimal office distractions lately. Even so, I'm even allowed hybrid office/WFH. frustrating honestly I've job searching find something flexibility. want keep employees, might keep flexibility. Yeah thats pretty similar feel. 6 mile, 10 minute commute always struggled stay productive stuck home 24/7. I'm pretty sure increased utilities cancel transportation savings since can't relax heating air conditioning. Even back high school college serious getting things done I'd anywhere home (Usually places limited pandemic like libraries Cafés). gets depressing unmotivated stuck home, especially start year ago even exercise much. due nature work it'll never go 100% remote, hybrid schedule prolonged periods emergency basis. can't even move somewhere I'd enjoy living more. Right? need people like life lol company planning 100% in-office end May, fucking ridiculous. instituted permanent WFH policy, draconian unless permanently immobilized they'll never approve post-COVID, even hybrid schedule. Every new hire asked there's WFH arrangement, answer basically ""no.""

I'm already planning looking new job things stabilize. company failed learn anything this, I'm out. Yeah, makes zero sense.

It’s currently used company adapt left least desirable part workforce choose  kind irritates me. I'm essential software engineer, show job site every day since began. weird people got spoiled. also bit irritating ones making requests thing.  Covid hybrid schedule two days office three days home. could vary depending weekend felt like going office. weeks stayed home weeks went 4 even 5 days. flexibility able amazing. I've 100% home past year.

I'm glad people similar options go back. Commuting 3 hours day office back instead sleeping spending time family fun. Still better shithole Ireland virus mutated spike point evaded vaccine, could longer enter cells infect people.

I told could possibly mutations spike protein still allow enter cells detected antibodies created vaccine (or non-mutant Covid infections). That's say maybe may need yearly booster shots Covid vaccine future. However, updating sequence mRNA vaccines account mutations spike protein seems trivial exercise compared initial creation vaccine. People kids small apartment guess Seriously. one carriers college *hated* group projects it. agree this. hear people lamenting lack social interaction random “water cooler chat” coworkers pandemic. However, unless happen work people really get along with, social interaction coworkers going limited professional bare minimum best, generally annoying interruptive feels like it’s forced. 

Prior pandemic, LOATHED forced socialization coworkers, events would planned unspoken thing job performance indirectly judged well schmooze kiss asses certain people. I’ve definitely observed naturally outgoing folks getting promoted quiet introverted folks like myself. 

I’ve loved pandemic, social interactions deliberate limited people genuinely want spend time interact with, work interactions left email Zoom without pressure befriend people nothing common. There’s much fake interest tolerate showing coworkers lose mind.  rather challenge conspiracy theory pandemic, use support bigotry you’ve chosen do.

Except one said two people 200 (relative example). like trumpsters act like batshit garbage, belived them, dumb shit democrats say. know could better. shitshow. Thing I'd rather stay home, left devices, exactly that. know that's unhealthy taking heavy toll mental health. need something forces get talk people (ideally ones already know well) won't, matter negative effects me. Even technology investment company saved pretty substantial amount going remote. lucky one leases run pandemic decided renew. Office space insurance expensive. huge boon staff, seen real side far productivity concerned. would anyone want go back either side management?  Children young people groups. people say ""young people"" they're generally referring 16-29, 0-16.

And know knew not, people older 16 even 29 there. tried considering before? Oh boy, think extra cost reliant “what employer provide exactly? Let’s 1:1 that”?

If you’re going way get extras, that’s luxury terms NEED order work. don’t NEED extra room work in; NEED pay extra transport get work. 2 days meetings per week? that's person replied took issue with. Looking skilled job full time job. go preparing interviews. go taking classes even Coursera brush skills. killing way kids.

P1 us soon well. Indian double mutant potentially eliminates vaccine protection landed California.

But know. pandemic we're good go back school. someone graduated December 2019 never stepped foot office boat. I’ve proven excel without needing office. plenty companies offering remote opportunities don’t want spend time car going office. Especially since they’re paying commute. I’ve always felt bad managers...or hated them. Lol Thanks! looking chart total doses vs. shared least one dose. use laptop, never said didn’t. Depends far burbs are. Luckily, get park free get train. Got mine yesterday, took 16 hours finally feel chills/headache woke 3am.

I also stuffy nose.. side effect well? can't find info anywhere google. That’s still choice. no, don’t get drop menu pick one want. don’t luxury quite yet unfortunately. I'm talking moving live somewhere else, weekend trips mean usually hang people outside work, it’s still 40hr chunk week. I’m honestly not, US still production/logistics juggernaut focused. Problem weren’t focused last year reason.... changed policy months ago. fine Moderna besides usual soreness vaccine. heard second dose side effects hit hard though ,I'll find 5/3. WTF? Germany get company subsidized public transport 43€ month. Regular price around 100€. shit fucked move LEDs install next place lol. Keep old bulbs get reinstalled move out. hate working home:( said pretty cool job. Kind like ""Hows Made"" everyday. they're well indoctrinated - even realize it. Younger generations? much. Jokes real hard convey text =| Hey middle management, job worthless. No, didn’t. stayed home soon end January 2020. live woods Maine. left house twice month pickup groceries. Never went store, always used curbside pickup always wore mask. don’t see could gotten it. live alone...bit modern day hermit. company people come back 1/2 time imagine part COVID, part easing people back office work isn’t sort uproar. Leadership isn’t actively promoting full time WFH option. It’s great company don’t see mass exodus happening. Flexibility working home solely conversation employee supervisor it’ll limited days month I’m sure. guess factory Baltimore messed entire batch still running yet. Due respect, case worse.
45% country voted Trump🥴 Yea guys stay home desired, also crummy office trolls never say anything positive, want return either lol, need hand phones. would make sense go back full time we've made year working remotely. spent lot time office nothing nothing comfort home guy never military. vaccines mandatory. gone university, vaccines mandatory. I'm washing/desinfecting every foreign object/grocery bring home, send 3 day quarantine closet. keep pandemic ends.

Even though chance transmission objects minimal supposedly, I'm trusting general hygene people come contact said stuff, witnessing last months fucking stupid ignorant people be. father 1 month old girl, previous health issues (asthma cancer) places risk group. 

If decrease odds contacting covid even 0.01% I'm gonna keep get second dose vaccine. Yep. I'm already looking options case company work aerospace industry decides force people go back building. aerospace industry, especially software, notorious control freaks, point eliminating windows buildings thing (no joke). going stir crazy lack social interactions.

post vaccine dinner friends instead anything coworkers. backlash proposal massive. Multiple states outlawed preemptively. going win, backed down. lot tech companies wave layoffs last year right pandemic hit.


We know prefer lay expensive employees, especially still pensions.


Combine *that* wave layoffs (potential) upcoming mass exodus people want flexibility WFH, tech companies might see two waves brain-drain total span 18 months.


It'll interesting see happens. quickly white-collar corporate America adapt WFH flexibility prospective employees?


My company inflexible WFH past, far silent they're going flexible WFH future. I'm already planning immediately jumping ship let continue work fully remote. OP switched words first sentence. Go means says, makes perfect sense. Unfortunately deal confidential information sign stuff working wouldn’t work anywhere else WFH. Good idea though 👍 company went working full time office, working full time home. saw drop productivity, cases even increase.

Sure, people increase productivity might sustainable (maybe they're working extra hours evening make time deal kids days), otherwise shown WFH decrease productivity. Employees need trained work managers need create realistic productivity goals.

I think best way future companies flexible use hybrid model, and/or base individuals working style. see NYC Denmark we’re still suspending April 15th, previously planned. happens decision based many new cases then, schedule looking vaccines. 

If don’t get rise new cases, wouldn’t surprised abandoned completely. According health agency, vaccination plan would postponed three weeks happens, it’s huge deal way things looking now. Remote work / virtual meetings got bad career development, looking new work experience.  That's awful. Sounds like commute college days. Luckily I'm 4 minutes office. Please go repopulate middle US. Office towers converted housing, solve shortage cities like Seattle. know? even schedule then? That’s bad thought that. Yeah, opened everyone. take little time things settle down. 50% 50%... someone lives 10min walk office, id rather quit 100% remote case Like???? Another part free food people going potentially staying longer.

Really depends though. lived brother worked Google while. fresh made breakfast, lunch dinner every day plus various snack areas. used eat dinner nights campus since lived blocks away. people brought whole family--could even catch meal weekends. add up, even 1 person, that's several thousand dollar tax free benefit really taking advantage it. Mainly people traveling overland route BC Alaska guess.  I'm thinking along lines time every highschool maybe gym class, IDK. enough instill general respect nature surrounded paved asphalt. college specifically stated never requiring it, however, might case universities. employees getting ready probably make moves like themselves. need pay absurd city rent keep job cheaper area. Must nice multiple rooms... big choo choo. would think fact less people dying covid proof vaccinations working, sounds newsworthy whatever Socialized medicine minimum wage aren’t end socialized economies, though understand point. Blaming workers making use welfare programs sure hell isn’t meaningful argument programs; least US access unemployment conditional refusing offer work regardless work search requirement.

I don’t blame negatively impacted COVID fallout resentments — think it’s key remember people power chose make proper preparations event...and yet are. also support universal basic income appropriately funding national crises like pandemic. sleep issue covid, got sleep days. think signal might good idea. Wouldnt surprised investigation showed development roll would take long enough wouldnt worth it. scientist? tetanus shot worst pfizer arm HURT. wife got moderna, rubbed per instructions nurse. arm fine. rub arm next time.  Metra Loop? near end L line? theyre not. want go 0 days week US divisions aren’t playing Canadian teams year company let us travel working days taxes. Every state handles differently company would prefer workers stay one state whole time they're working. So? change fact identical need hold specific doses millions coming every week. Germany back vaccination stuff? one believing politicians saying ""the interim"", we're waiting goalposts move. Probably something new variant, wait children vaccinated. chicken duck Yup, sounds right. clawed way cardiologist told symptoms due IBS needed electrolytes drink Gatorade :))) Definitely didn’t direct comment would’ve responded something said, there’s need defensive. 

I’ve met good friends work too, doesn’t change anything said. I’ve also close enough coworkers extracurriculars, too, doesn’t mean good work/life balance lol portion I’m sure keep mind actual physical process burial/cremation part funeral cost/process. There’s going plenty services funeral homes post covid there’s tombstone selection, etc. second dose makes body react even worse, I’m getting it.

everything read said react first shot, 2nd. covid? Cool, let lazy bums invisible pointless jobs quit then. Open new jobs unemployed masses can’t afford “home office” spike proteins created vaccine cannot reproduce, localized injection site, destroyed bodies immune response creating protective antibodies.

That far different covid infection lungs constantly reproducing viral load throughout body.

The spike protein additional harmful long term effects evidence vaccinated. Uh quite possible develop disorder recovers, happened me. Telling kid anxiety vastly risk covid surely way harm anxiety levels lmao Damn skippy Workers unfortunately little power. Many work places thankfully shifted model benefits foreseeable future. 

But large portion workers really say would quit risk livelihood (rent, mortgage, loans, food, leisure) two hours. fact unless workers make condition employment remain whims boss tomorrow decides. 

The boss tomorrow may today. r/teachers whole teacher contingent Reddit EXTREMELY toxic. much cynical attitude, like ""oh well kids care difference make."" really much write it. look data see everyone knows why.  


Media always focus negative newsworthy. otherwise another man bites dog story. happiest ever working, I'm assuming productivity same, better, before. Something management take account.  lol ignorant. please educate Thats CDC allocates See problem living suburbia taking train work still need car you’re back suburbia. 

Live city walk ride work well store, bars, restaurants, etc. ditch car.  guess depends job and, even more, home. live studio working home would mean I'd spend 8-9h sitting desk then, finished, stay exact room/desk afterwards. clear line work/home anymore,you never really disconnect/get away it. Whereas work office, simply leave day leave work working environmemt behind you... importantly, go safe home. you’re trying fair comparison costs course 1:1 possible. hell would give negotiation? Pocket difference don’t think need room. company sure pocket savings let them. 

Fwiw concept pretty well established car use work purposes. could argue already car need pay gas. However could also say hey, need see clients car, need something isn’t 90s Sentra. also pay share use expenses like insurance depreciation, even though fixed cost outside mileage. standard reimbursement rate includes things. 

I’m sure aversion getting paid is. People would rather unemployed work full-time office..? doesn’t make much sense me. think people voted emotion. I’d love go back working home (or least hybrid home/office schedule) wouldn’t give income inconvenience working office. quit asked come back office full time? get better offer elsewhere. Yes, are!  get time every day anyway? matter WFH not? commute LA would put traffic average 2 hours per day (24 miles round trip). extra sleep time unwind end day nice. time I’d get home, work eat dinner practically bedtime None things kids distracted, original argument. 

I already know *some* kids harder time masks. Others not. still firmly believe pandemic controlled vaccination school aged children, preferable kids get sick potentially develop worse condition. permanent damage.  don’t blame anyone want since see valid reasons wanting 100% remote, 100% office, everything between. 

That said, think employer thinks they’re going keep people consistently anymore without flexible model delusional. There’s putting genie back bottle, matter much people might want to. 

Things trending way anyway, Covid gave violent shove forward. family member *still* washes groceries... They're fully vaccinated planning stopping, either. Pretty sure spouse patience saint point. I've driving 25 years. I've never ""had roll down"" window traffic light.

Pre-covid, Mumbai &amp; Kochi Trivandrum every month. recall drivers ever rolling windows lights, except put parking ticket thingie machine airport. witnessed lots incessant honking, window-rolling.

A reasonable approach would specify masks needed car window rolled down.

If someone alone air-conditioned car windows closed... makes sense. read first sentence thinking myself.... Huh that's crazy. I'm truck driver around 30% pay load goes straight fuel costs, certain amount also goes maintenance costs well. That's including truck payment insurance costs.

Too bad can't drive truck computer still get paid. I'd sure get better sleep. need distinguish two. doses coming every week. 

There first second doses. US. fully endorse safe. 75% senior citizens received least 1 vaccine dose, outside age group, COVID necessarily serious flu. (Among kids, COVID killed around 200 people, well 400-500 kids die typical flu season.) Among teachers childcare workers, 80% people received least 1 vaccine dose. 40% general adult population well, skewed towards vulnerable people.

If worried protection members families taking, absolutely right keep kid group sports. every family deserves make decision themselves.

And ain’t kids disappointed missing soccer. It’s developing sedentary lifestyle course year staying indoors playing video games encouraged. It’s one thing help kid disappointment. It’s another thing watch gain much weight, kill early reduce quality life. One reason Michigan combines Sunday &amp; Monday reports Monday, report Sunday. 12/27 1/2, combined Thursday/Friday/Saturday deaths Sunday report. 7 day decreasing good news, day's data missing worst state leaves lot desired. No. Requiring kids show records vaccination attend public schools different showing records vaccination enter Walmart pretend otherwise dishonest. Find new slant. one vaccine passports unaware kids need vaccinated go school. StOp PoStInG ThInG. way, US federal government agrees me. Perfect example older generations extremely vulnerable. Sounds like experienced internet still believes bullshit reads. Better get cough checked out. good nowadays. 86% cruise volume four lines: RCL, Carnival, NCL Disney.

You're right cruises cater seniors actually minority statistically.

Sorry topic I'm passionate (I've 30 cruises). Oh sounds tough. :( way get FB weeks? mean quitting altogether would best gotta start somewhere. know Americans spreading bs believe nonsense.

Its them, sides whatever spectrum like use (political, education, wealth). Interesting. haven’t seen here. I’ve definitely seen people angry indoor dining, outdoor dining no-brainer terms risk. Absolutely, comparing timelines US Germany it’s good point “eligibility opens up” equal “everyone wants dose vaccinated”. Germans talking point 75% adults vaccinated. still take weeks US reaches point, uptake high all. Somebody something fucking idiot ruining country something might help: can't rationally believe correct less 50% time. did, every time reasoned something rational thing would believe opposite. that's also really bad ""I calculations, looks like we'll make jump, therefore make jump I'm almost always wrong"" 

So believe right least half time. someone comes around telling everything believe wrong can't rationally take word it. right free speech free assembly matter ""global freaking pandemic"". STAY INSIDE CITIZEN! covid back March last year. worried right now? get? Vaccine uptakes Germany US much different. polls even put US Germany though numbers subject I’m reading right, actually “open” CA. CA’s reopening plan still includes mask mandate THINK (could wrong) capacity limits. means still another step go “full reopening.” sounds like VT things optional full reopening occurred. Conservative Americans specifically. 

I'm friends group fairly liberal people, group chat filled much fear horseshit constantly get fights them. wrong almost every single time, 3 4 vs 1 (Me), facts sources matter. fear.

It conservative people fear monger spread misinformation. 100% vaccinated then? thought said Brazilians, also fitting, depressing. Pure security theater. Something airline industry well practiced in! Nova Scotia. I've gathered, gov't decided law enforcement officers risk exposure teachers are. I'm guessing there's logic behind this, still wish they'd considered us (teachers/EPAs/etc.) going ahead age model, I'd want go someone over, say, 60. Wait, believe everything read online? help nation's top infections disease expert leading charge directly deliberately lying masks right get go. goes bottom way top here. sides equation reason, today, avoid sending abroad. US gvmt bankrolled domestic demand still outstrips supply. change months, that's real issue long term.

The real issue potential liability concern manufacturers. sign contracts US gvmt understanding product entered stream commerce without protections jdx product lands, they're likely sufficiently notice potential (inevitable) litigation foreign markets. Accepting countries would need clear legal hurdles, probably including blanket waivers, order receive vaccines. That's clauses contracts currently. domestic supply outstrips demand there's ton impetus change that. imagine month so. They're probably start Mexico Central America. agree last point - districts able hire teachers purpose virtual instruction scenario possible. reality though many districts, particularly small ones, resources hire virtual instruction (without teachers working well outside certification areas teaching several age groups). percentage people would even want virtual option also varies greatly community. work setting probably 5% 10% families would consider virtual option...and many cases parents allowing children choose want (not necessarily concern safety). create entire slate options small subset community, especially group allowing kids make choice? think makes sense...and without resources create virtual-only classes, left option trying accommodate everyone expense 90% population.

Now, seems like setting might different, might viable option community. 15 million doses destroyed good thing matter spin it. Ok. I'll bite. Show one ""highly credentialed doctors"". I'm genuinely curious come with. went bakersfield Saturday, make second appointment there.

However, said able find appointment closer home, could cancel appointment bakersfield. Numbers went large swaths country October December. make causation correlation. Stop selfish crybaby learn adapt. Learn new hobbies involve bars/restaurants, gyms, human contact. really hard, got back building model tanks, ships, airplanes I'm perfectly content. need go bar happy. European cruise lines banned kids? European brands mostly senior crowd anyway that's surprising. Viking already adults even without pandemic. That's easy transition make.

However four ""US firms"" named make 86% cruising volume, anecdote exception, rule. Eh...half country misled snarky FOXNEWS type media outlets. mocked people trying take seriously warn new studies showing potential long term consquences. They're damn smug too. can't say want another month caution without people saying shit plague rats year ago: ""You stay inside live fear want, I've got life!"" ""What, want masks LIFE?!?!""

Now look us; ignoring article raising valid concerns variants immediately shitting people already burning masks.

Cool bruh. I'll sit red california pocket one's given shit whole time hope god carefree attitude lead jackasses around jumping 'It's over!' bandwagon without actually getting vaccine following single guideline. I'm sure end well. It’s option, also show vaccine card, negative test results.

I received AstraZeneca vaccine - trial - showed card got last night isn’t cdc card mentions hasn’t received emergency use authorization. let didn’t question it. terrifying parents transform much. easy way deal that. Perhaps overwhelmed, mum battling serious health issues well ee press issue time.

Perhaps they're used critical everything read something happens naturally age. 

Maybe get old going online rampage kids whatever social platform exists future eating avocados need gene therapy illuminati scheme. proving point lack mental maturity childish outbursts.

You're one started conversation insulting me. I'm getting level &lt;3 Conspiracy conspiracy goddamn endgame anyways? make parking lots less crowded? US less 1000 deaths today, we'll gone full week without one day 1000 deaths. Put fully vaccinated first class suite A380 states anyone wants vaccine shot arm weeks. easily 2 months ahead Germany. Hell willing take road trip anyone could go south get vaccinated today. different July. I'm young literally know anyone 16 unvaccinated state. I’m honestly surprised many all. think it’s important note study can’t say precisely transmission occurred; case “associated” outdoor activities. Maybe construction workers ride maskless work trucks together sites, maybe sports cases went pub playing game. 

The outdoors abundantly safe. kinda knew reply moment posted it. Please read thing come back us tell us. issue AZ UK. sure scientists Oxford great job developing safe efficient vaccine time. 

AstraZeneca failed build supply chain properly fulfill orders. deliveries Q1 less 30 million promised EU 80 million. J&amp;J, Moderna Pfizer involved god know many plants throughout EU fulfill orders really see absolutely everything fulfill orders, much unlike AZ. Guess helps part intra-National bloc like EU vaccines rationed member states. looked this? summer cruises already fully booked families. Maybe active cruise forums let tell average cruising family cruising soon ships set sail. Europe have.

Interesting see US firms taking completely different approach. Good luck that. guess know Trumps reddit account Shymeeee  really depends cruise line on, long cruise is, traveling to. many cruises majority actually retired people. one cruise (12 day cruise) saw one kid boat. what’s gonna finally kill net neutrality Thank based god.

I'm trying argue, definition ""spike""? None major lines announced that. RCL, Carnival, NCL Disney (obviously) allowing kids. It’s time question US oversees UK vaccination speed. couple months US vaccination effort program basically done. take another couple months UK reach point. really explain what's happening Michigan, though. Yesterday cases state (6,149 according Worldometer) population roughly 10 million (compared roughly 20 million NY). Michigan 10% yesterday's total cases 3% country's population. (Numbers based Google/Worldometer) source, also watched news clip (I believe CBS) yesterday mentioned percent positivity also climbed back 5% 15%, number tests. Bloomberg account, view stats 32.6/19 Americans, 41.7/24.4 18+ Americans. There's discrepancy total vaccinated total 18+, assume that's 16/17 year olds.

People discuss herd immunity ways, caveat saying percentage adults, take mean percentage total population. Yeah, I'm still pumping one-year-old (had second pfizer shot 3 weeks ago) might help can't hurt. see many fake passports appear doctors giving like sick notes schools/employers. really work 90% customers though.

You know really fucking sucks? People like feel like a-ok selfish shit throw caution wind there's good news around vaccines. damn crowd year ago gung-ho everyone pitching could go back normal. really nice knowing sacrifices we've made mean absolutely nothing condescending ass long group gets live.

Holy fuck, asking continued caution dust settles fear mongering like vast majority people seem think. 

I genuinely hope correct. virus changes rapidly. fuck wrong another month make sure even people summer? Fuckin hell, damn sympathy. think taste thing due fever. lost taste temporarily fevers past. No, COVID-19 contact anyone has. We've careful. 

I've finally crawled bed couch. I've checked temperature &amp; back normal, hopefully things start looking today. Fingers crossed. 

SN: we've told people got Moderna vaccine, we've multiple people say ""ooh, that's bad one."" Even small portion people, reputation. Even nurse drive thru vaccine site said struggling give (as opposed 2 options). True, different western Euorpean country (perhaps except Sweden) UK getting one eventually lock much stricter German one.  even looked page, shows news articles verified pages, faults vaccines hypocrisy politicians. It’s backed reliable sources interviews doctors prove ‘Covid deniers’ wrong what's argument CA? done properly? That's worked properly? I’m like opposite side spectrum. work remotely forever , I’d start looking another job. always thought introverted, pandemic taught interacting person co-workers get projects done pretty beneficial. I’m software developer, job done home, isn’t same. Nothing beat actual whiteboard session try figure problem. Sure web-apps simulate whiteboard , can’t beat in-person experience. 

I know people really bad commutes would rather wfh work home. don’t blame all. think hybrid model would best. That’s fucked Delete Facebook HUGE problem contributes life harder less easily mobile medical conditions.

Wow idea. guess weren’t following science one, unless risk trying mitigate primarily transmission staff. Interestingly sending schools back U.K.
hasn’t amounted spike cases. someone lives here, beg differ
Situation terrible here, thing government talking “more lockdowns” You’re giving much credit. Facebook memes Yes that’s meant, thank you. terrifies many people think this. essentially happened state. worked home way better navigating system time drive day long appoint appointment. Essential workers hand trying figure out. Yeah Home Depot got back months ago guys still huge wave. Basically online I’ve gotten steady supply them.  I’ve probably bought 300 now.  carry around car individual ziplock bags. see people double masking taking precautions seriously anything less n95 mask strike quick conversation.  give 2 4 note buy online. 

F&amp;(k Covid Us general work though. 


The UK implemented 3 strict lockdowns throughout pandemic time. Cases started drop week implemented deaths 3-4 weeks later expected whilst UK said strict rules infection rates reduced. 


Of course stop lockdowns cases go back up, obvious. 


Given Germany process vaccinating population seems stupid let people die couple months away getting life saving vaccine. going get downvoted, wrong. 

Basically free market relies clear contracts. EU changing thier position fact. making even harder others plan thier rollout.

does exonerate AZ shortfall EU? no. EU anti trade. estimates much undercounted, America, least, far higher two three ties. like ten. really educate yourself. They're wild thread. There's post stating many reputable scientists warning vaccine. Someone asked source literally anything proving said check Instagram page. mean, that's stupid people are. can't possibly disect news source look primary sources like reports scientific papers, instead resort app shows pictures videos minute. That's source. That's easily they're manipulated. insane see grandmother told mom vaccine causes infertility, mom freaked younger siblings getting it. took two seconds find many articles debunking stupid shit. Americans super-spreaders misinformation, period. Germany handled crisis better western countries, seems like vaccination effort slowly coming together too. I’m sure also domestic issues Germany surely worst. Thanks clarification. explanation also wrong, got look calculation: (rate unvaxxed infection - rate vaxed infection)/rate unvaxed infection. I’m cases sample sizes even term drops we’re left 92% accuracy: sample sizes really don’t know proportion vaccinated people actually end sick, you’re right.


But... doesn’t change fact told wear masks distance breakthrough cases happening don’t want create new variants. public health messaging unclear don’t blame people upset, we’re literally race variants get herd immunity. Private companies likely require short term, long term. covid threat want deal headache.

So system likely means companies would otherwise required right never will. doesn’t - article quotes email Tegnells danish colleague danish government:

""(…) *We know quite confidentially Swedes already found new coronavirus flu surveillance weeks 10 11, corresponding fact infection widespread parts Sweden since beginning March*.""

Sweden’s neighbours managed shut relatively early without use time machines. Nothing hindered Sweden acting early nothing forced wait much later. police used water cannons protesters break Kassel Berlin, go ahead. referring article paper. Lmao yeah scmp constantly posts anti China news puppet ccp get grip peak inside mind anti-vaxxer. need save re-opening. eradicated unless eliminated countries... can't make comeback (most people born 1980 never vaccinated smallpox). better believe biased interviews? Yeah. used come sub everyday specifically that. here, would check articles too. It’s nice see progress. Give jobs work hot sweaty kitchen j would love work office. Exactly. Conservatives want increase wealth (at expense everything/everyone) make upwards mobility impossible get enjoy it. wearing masks fully vaccinated flight? Thanks Guaranteed going get spun conspiracists Covid misinformation proof hoax. Tell people /r/COVID19Positive [smell cigarettes time, can't eat cause everything tastes like rotten Never, welcome ""new normal"" Reality likely dictate opposite.

A cruise (or other) company emerges hygiene theatre, vaccine mandates, people inclined use service strings attached possible.

Another example - UK, holidays Portugal Turkey require proof vaccine certification. 

As someone pro-vaccine, countries imposing certification enter (on top negative test) seriously think tourism sector compete away medical bureaucracy? Achieved, guess, going way pandemic. Set foot outside major cities without mask watch happens. You’ll either treated like leper verbally assaulted. classic example “Follow science...until doesn’t align viewpoints anymore.” mean that? ship sailed, highly doubt see compliance another Lockdown. vaccines don’t think works like point well year pandemic feels ridiculous, though. ALWAYS concern COVID. seem really certain something scientific consensus. source news fucking Instagram page that's recent posts things like ""Brave teacher speaks out"" context interview saying booster possible? Really? 

You think best source information Instagram feed? Come man, literally pictures short videos that's basing **incredibly** important ""opinion"" on? 

I truly hope one day see stupid is. easily social media manipulate you, easy take 1 minute clips pictures make seem like correct, even clearly aren't. goal tamp numbers enough risk outbreak small. almost accounts we're still point. Definitely getting much closer, there's COVID hospitalization/death. know people can't smell/taste properly 6+ months post viral clearance.....Less cases, less chances people end w/ chronic issues like that. cases go down: See? Lockdowns work. working. Compliance working!

When cases go up: zero evidence provided, magically compliance got thrown window, fault. Lockdowns perfect, fucked up. Lockdowns don’t work. It’s clear evidence strict states now? I’m loop states.

TN here. We've fully open basically since June. Little-to-no restrictions. Voluntary masks. think they'll it, anyway. Nope. I'm 100% opposite. I'd rather quit stay home. post claims side effects happen second dose bad.

Please quote said. parents insistent Covid created government lab enforce population control. rewrites DNA using dead babies.

They Southern Americans.

Providing factual data disproving conspiracies nothing refuse believe scientists government. 

I feel people believe stuff actually wants believe stuff reason. believe anything hear exciting enough, remembered fact need verify. phrased like that, justification (for continuing masks distancing) probably become ""just hold little longer... close kids get vaccinated, 1 kid every 3,500,000 catches Covid requires hospitalization... care children?""... wait it, elderly longer concern shift. pretty low me.... rate reinfection low worth worrying about, least short term.

That's actually originally suspected. 65 reports 13,000 suspected cases pretty substantial. also means still unknown variables could cause reinfection resemble reinfection. based SARS study (SARS-CoV1-1) family coronaviruses someone similar protein structure, T-cells remain active long time, sure much protection triggers whether enough regardless viral load. whole variant thing cluster fuck misinformation sides, Moderna vaccine definitely great contingency since essentially makes immune system sensitive protein structure prominent COVID variants trigger trip general check up, actual issue putting off.

Statistically speaking depending severity issue, could worth risk. Also lot unknowns time (September) regarding novel virus regardless people left right wing media stated. Much primary literature time bit ambiguous really blame him. Left saying worst thing ever, Right saying like flu, literature saying ""I know"" waiting info making risky moves personal choice. get far argument, us immediately combative other's statements backed away. sure hell wasn't. fine letting drop, going stand ground willing lose friendship pushed hard reason.

Honestly conservatives freaking virus careful virus (wearing face shields everything). consistency basing actions dependable sources cared about. wearing masks way early February back everyone scoffed idea primary literature pointed to. say true, tell. really bothers take fact turn much fear mongering much possible still directly lying something.

I mean left right wing media fear monger, fear monger different things. nature media. Yes does, look Instagram story. think one doctors expired posted 24 hours ago. there’s stuff vaccines right now, we’re basically right wven though people said ‘it’s extensive testing, can’t argue scientists’ scientific illiteracy country truly staggering. one thing understand something; another thing proudly boast topic though do. wonder whether first dose Manaus functioning like second dose, since population already infected standard coronavirus? Brazil's per capita death rate still lower seen United Kingdom, around 1 700 Brazilians died vs 1 every 450 Britons. 1. hospital supply chain still corrupt favors masks china due bulk pricing

2. CDC actually want americans wear n95s would mean spending way money keep national stockpile HCWs replenished

3. google amazon allow direct sales consumers based recommendations CDC item 2. result companies bankrupt within year less. also greatly benefits 3M honeywell etc. since need domestic competition. Done. one needs banned spreading objectively wrong information. negative side effects feeling generally bad somewhat common, especially second shot. Every single one friends side effects, well documented thing. 

Why directly lying? Reporting post misinformation. Working home one covid changes hope sticks. Getting bed 3 minutes start time incredible. allows get little household chores done I'm working evenings weekends.... Laundry, vacuuming, cleaning kitchen, etc. company told us one way another yet year proving works we're productive, more, really hope let continue. majority people see advocating WFH permanently 100% people houses (not apartments) families work computer. everyone spacious home, family, works computer. think best solution hybrid let people pick half week they're office half they're home. Either 100% person 100% remote going issues. shit. Really? he’s clearly hoarding vaccines close him, probably get back production make money quicker. say specifically anti-vaxxer, he/she literally saying got vaccine. seem little fearmonger-ish way worded. already knew people ignore study well.  new? hope. U ok hun? juke fake true, time last year still thought would last couple weeks reality set in, oh boy. difference year makes. Imagine time next year, bliss. enough people refuse vaccination world whole can’t get back normal.

Also refuse vaccine idiots shunned society. you’re dumb enough refuse vaccine, else dumb enough do? don’t want around find out. agree. think doctors adhere guidelines fake passports thing. Republicans say thing, reality situation require get real passports. Whether 2023, can't say know come back like flu.  knock effects sporting events large gatherings. Namely bars get crowded games. across board dumb gullible also egotistical can’t admit we’re wrong don’t know something.

I love people say country implies ""My country full IDIOTS everywhere. Oh me! I'm smart."" partly agree, mother god, one year two months pandemic. Scientists intelligent people. know press works, surely learned now.

All takes writing back media vehicle, social media (after all, every epidemologist seems active twitter nowadays), correcting saying ""i mean that!""

They don't. either agree appreciate heavily edited fearmongering headlines whatever reason. would work would piss off. anti-vaxxer get paid didn't? sources German:

* [original calculation mid (PDF contains explanations)
* [updated calculation assume 25% Germany's adult population wanting get vaccinated.

They claim every adult German wants vaccine get first shot full vaccination end July! (time needed full efficacy second shot included) enjoy interacting coworkers throughout day, 5 I'm ready turn alone. Introverts necessarily shy even avoid social situations. require lot alone time though. limiting factor vaccinations *number vaccines*, logistics. We’re injecting pretty much every dose receive. Jesus, keep seeing people saying “why don’t vaccinate lol” people government aren’t *extremely eager that*. going anecdotew stats? friends definitely younger age groups vaccines time(18-22) none us experienced anything except sore arm. people I've heard side effects people 30-50, seniors I've talked felt nothing either.

I know alot people I'm area fairly well vaccination, that's still anecdotal evidence. Masks disruptive kids parents convinced that. feels strange. walked COVID immunization checkpoint unannounced got first shot questions asked. Serbia, 30 something year old dude health risks. Germany potential rollout July. feels weird. posts got lots upvotes attention....are bad? 

Thats mods reasoning? I’m scared gonna become next thing. “We need protect anti vaxxers” fuck don’t That's case, quite opposite actually.

I French monitoring neighbours' situation closely well, compare clusterfuck government's response.

On vaccine situation, simply enough. France received 13M doses (pop 67M). rate test UE part deal. UE led incompetent naïve people.

Meanwhile, half measures social distancing masks stop covid enough. 1 year mandatory masks closed spaces, cinema, restaurants last 6 months. work, enough (especially UK variant).

The problem leaders use lockdown: epidemic control enough vaccines, there's nothing else do. 

No problem use way could avoid worst. Let describe leaders UE, special ineptitude bonus France's Macron:

""oh epidemic slow, numbers low""

""oh increasing. Let's social distancing etc never worked well enough""

""oh control, could seen coming ? lockdown.""

Lockdown ""resets"" epidemic. Rinse repeat.

Whereas 1 year know signs rising epidemic. preventative lockdowns stop epidemic quickly efficiently. so-called leaders afraid thzt think population accept lockdowns unless see people dropping dead news.

Yeah, I'm sure australia nz sad leaders took measures. stark contrast month ago, Israel's vaccination rate data getting discouraging longer look it. What's new excuse now, teachers? ""Gimme wallet, explain "" Interestingly Austria Moderna planned around fluctuating much. testing anyone time. profile states son admitted hospital Arizona January 15th, full 11 days earliest confirmed case Arizona. Even case January 26th confirmed later.

This person positive test somehow got place reporting Arizona Public Health. Chances whole story mostly BS something COVID. 

Being vent 24 days also makes zero sense, that's triple average time vent COVID patient. unlikely story. Pretty stupid remove daily update posts lot people coming see vaccine progress allowing, whole year, people posting updates cases daily. cause protests not?? Doesn’t add like anti-vax people referencing exact debunked study 90s, using different sources discuss unique. matter. got blinders fused sides head. indoctrinated look government, government officials, government appointees wisdom, education, guidance, protection..and one get through. Sadly, unable question look outside box, worse, valid dissenting information face, automatically dismiss it.  Listen, think know all, go get shots. American, seems weird me. Here, vaccination available Biden set goal available Americans end month. goal seems completely doable. Several states already there. live basically walk pharmacy get shot. I've heard several anecdotal stories happening. hear another first world country struggling supply US swimming vaccine seems weird all. What's verdict AzSeneca vaccine? pretend know is, Chief Medical Officer UK large input UK pandemic response, hysterical catastrophic vaccination, way balanced moderate. know outdoor gatherings like protests completely safe? reach breaking point, protests started getting violent

No not, haven't. yet stop bitching making excuses go back work. wife worked home day two per week pre-pandemic trying get WFH time. working home year now. job better couch, going stir crazy lack social interactions. 

She's hoping type hybrid arrangement I'm actually going low-key miss able tell instant general level care-for-fellow-man person seeing wear mask not, more-so wearing one 100% need to; like NYC us wear time out.

We're also superspreaders COVID lol record trying discourage you, wear mask you’d like reason didn’t get cold tied mask, it’s probably tied social distancing. Things like cold flu spread lot less people stop things like going school/work/concerts/sporting events/anything people gather. unless you’re also going continue I’d expect results mask. work bar, we've closing 11pm year now. past week went back 2am. I've started job hunting. then?

Keep mask mandate now. Focus increasing pace vaccinations. That's pretty much anyone do. Stuff like changing bar/restaurant capacity limits 50% 30% imposing curfews seem effect new case counts. healthcare system collapsing interim vaccines still taking hold, take several weeks best. Um due lockdown, due government supporting affected lockdown. Actually right. Soo That's interesting question one can't answer. hit July much accurate reading big spike is. everything politics come too. spike significant enough, Boris able afford closing country summer many businesses hospitality expecting large profits? 

As vaccines, eventually provide us out. first need 80% country fully vaccinated achieve degree herd immunity. Unfortunately able achieve August, especially seeing 250k people vaccinated last week - course due vaccine shortage UK currently experiencing. 

There's lot variables play unfortunately. don’t go game. Stay inside rest lives, one miss you. Journalists really good writers anymore. hated working home. short commute, help, ended working longer hours shutting worked home easy ""quickly"" attend something.

Immunity vaccines measured years decades. agreed you.... want go vacation 2022 Australia something they’ll likely require proof vaccination keep citizens safe. CDC reminder cards don’t serve good proof vaccination there’s way verify them.

Several countries Africa require proof yellow fever vaccination visit. I’m assuming cautious countries require proof COVID-19 vaccination visit, least years.  reason could residual first infection rather new infection.

I seen several studies reinfection, neither mass sequencing. E.g Quatar study September think it, epidemiology point view thing mostly matters probability someone recovering Covid19 falling sick back (whether old infection new one marginally relevant).. So, kind data far easiest collect, also likely useful

I pretend expert, pretend followed Covid news (which includes published studies) somewhat seriously thats instant lawsuit subsidies based religions thats violation 1st amendment sick stay home That's insane. another way articles it. everybody goes daily thread. Depends state now, soon matter.

The disparity strong enough, consistently so, wondering anyone knows reasoning behind it. know supposed ""full-time"" jobs. mostly people useless white collar positions. blue collar workers (plumbers, electricians, hvac, etc) people essential work general. Hell, even people favor shutdowns labeled jobs non-essential.

The fat needs trimmed. Many children teenagers developed mysterious inflammatory syndrome emerge several weeks contracting coronavirus never classic Covid-19 symptoms time infection, according largest study far cases United States.

The study, led researchers Centers Disease Control Prevention, found 1,000 cases information whether got sick initial Covid-19 illness available, 75 percent patients experience symptoms. two five weeks later, became sick enough hospitalized condition, called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Children (MIS-C), affect multiple organs, especially heart.

Published Tuesday JAMA Pediatrics, study said “most MIS-C illnesses believed result asymptomatic mild Covid-19” followed hyper-inflammatory response appears occur patients’ bodies produced maximum level antibodies virus. Experts yet know young people, smaller number adults, respond way.

“It means primary-care pediatricians need high index suspicion Covid prevalent society children often asymptomatic disease initial Covid infection,” said Dr. Jennifer Blumenthal, pediatric intensivist pediatric infectious disease specialist Boston Children’s Hospital, involved study.
The researchers evaluated 1,733 2,090 cases syndrome people age 20 younger reported C.D.C. January.

The findings show although syndrome rare, serious. C.D.C’s data included patients hospitalized. 90 percent young people experienced symptoms involving least four organ systems 58 percent needed treatment intensive care units.


Many experienced significant heart issues: half developed low blood pressure, 37 percent developed cardiogenic shock 31 percent experienced cardiac dysfunction involving heart’s inability pump adequately. study said significantly higher percentage patients Covid-19 symptoms experienced heart problems, compared initial coronavirus symptoms. greater percentage initially asymptomatic patients also ended intensive care.

“Even kids severe MIS-C, I.C.U. — vast majority preceding illness recognized,” said Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief infectious diseases Children’s National Hospital Washington, D.C., involved research.

The study provided detailed demographic geographic picture syndrome date. 34 percent patients Black 37 percent Hispanic, reflecting way coronavirus disproportionately affected members communities. pandemic went on, authors wrote, proportion patients white increased, comprising 20 percent cases. People Asian heritage comprised 1 percent patients.

Pharmacists researchers five large corona vaccines hardly break published research data side effects gender. Partly this, clear whether side effects occur differently men women, according research Platform Investigative Journalism Investico Trouw, EenVandaag De Groene Amsterdammer. Worldwide, women report far side effects corona vaccines men.

So far Dutch side effects center Lareb received 26 thousand reports almost 152 thousand side effects. reporters, 86.6 percent women, possibly far many young, female health workers vaccinated. 'If women already reporting more, know why. experience complaints, actually complaints, likely raise alarm,' says Lareb director Agnes Kant. serious side effects also far mainly affected women - low platelet thrombosis associated AstraZeneca vaccine.

Investico studied clinical trials five corona vaccines - Pfizer/BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sputnik V Janssen - published scientific journals Lancet Nature. one reported occurred side effects gender. Even women test group certain side effects, would show results effect roughly half group.

'Age much bigger impact, immune system ages along it, vaccine therefore sometimes work well older people,' says Marc Kaptein, medical director Pfizer Netherlands. Pfizer looked retrospectively see certain subgroups stood out, meaningful difference found side effects effectiveness men women, says Kaptein. data public.

Olaf Dekkers, epidemiologist member College Medicine Review, adds many subgroups makes harder make judgment vaccine. 'You make infinite subgroups. test groups getting smaller smaller, greater chance extreme results chance.'

However, even MEB, asked, cannot find information Moderna's dataset. Although hard requirement approval, board regrets information missing says report EMA.

It’s made seriously consider occupation going forward WFH continued pandemic. like separating work life home life. staying home everyday much social interaction coworkers horrendous. Every article contradicts one idea media blame.

definitely. ones always go ""hurr SEVERAL TRILLION DOSES LYING AROUND STORAGE NOTHING HAPPENS"" keeps getting repeated everywhere reddit German redditors. Truth is, percentage that's ""lying around storage"" high EU countries well USA. even lying around, deliveries received previous week vaccinated yet somehow interpret lying around completely unused months

It's ridiculous Germans seem see impossible manipulate, yet eat everything media publishes without informing further. yes, I'm German. Lockdown usually associated 'stay home' rules I'm referring too.

Lesser restrictions really lockdown restrictions.

I'm referring end March 2020, start October 2020 start January 2021 times stay home order came minor tweaks existing restrictions. true unfortunately Exactly. last month two three days alone office - team vacation obligations. literally sitting alone 8 hours day front monitor - could done home (and saved lot time energy due commute). There’s thing called perspective. Cruise liners environmental disaster. Peak consumer culture finest - hop aboard fuel-guzzling ship sail one port call next, leaving trail trash shit wake. makes feel better, despite frequently checking coronavirus sub, think see comments worrying told wear mask past July, actual comments saying people wear mask forever. 

There people, like OC, suggest wearing masks now, necessarily forever. Plus, I’m opinion anyone wanting continue mask usage minority there’s really way masks could enforced past summer. I’m fully vaccinated person people don’t trust folks power. don’t agree, completely get skeptical numerous lies (US) government, media said last couple years. makes sense continue wear masks heard immunity achieved. Thanks posting this! Hopefully mods reconsider stance. youre basically justfying 2-4 months behind fine.

I want job life 2 completely separate things, dont want overlap ... denigrating folks gall calmly lie sunny beach sunbathing realize we're talking people full-time jobs? week shut whole sub day?

Tbf one protest occurred numerous subreddits likely. haven’t always? 14 months pandemic, point 6 months rolling lockdowns. government nothing offer besides ""more lockdown"". 

there concrete plan return normal, vaccinations going snails pace &amp; concrete plan vaccination ramp up. basically nothing besides ""urging patience"" months months Note Ireland nobody really wears masks outside.

Now see outdoor mask wearing mandates ridiculous. group like you. office LA half staff never showed work. ever 405, you’d agree them! Hybrid schedules answer. definitely want go 3 days week ever again. people outsourcing remote office work since pandemic, get pay for. low wage worker developing country knows English second language completely different time zone spotty internet connection easiest employee manage get high output from. Plus often even hiring people directly firm contracts work out.

Plus, alternative pretending employers daft realize outsourcing exists. Like go office realize done remotely?  survey really specify fields ""more 1,000 employees US companies"" work, guess assume covers representative swath US workers. say, people want work home, like office (indeed perhaps get away home), like both. now, situation UK gotten much better Brazil still downward spiral Probably it’s fall yet they’ll change soon Cost never barrier shot though. Local health department asks see ID showing 18 that's pretty much it. like lot barriers present. think phrase overused.

Just speaking language highlight absurdity subreddit disease banning information vaccinations prevent disease. Honestly? sounds wonderful. God forbid cares day admitted, tbh. 

We testing sickest late January. first “confirmed” case early-on Jan. 20. We’re also fairly confident community spread already happening time (it confirmed early February 50 states March). [We also know likely circulating US early December also know many patients vented early pandemic. 

The timeline’s fine. reason us reddit randos try un-diagnose someone else’s kid year-plus fact. Leave alone. Lol! wouldn’t getting best them. early days pandemic, told staff may contemplate pay cuts means avoiding layoffs. one griped. one complained. solidarity would save could.

That could give opportunity keep business intact possible fight way pandemic.

You don’t get team attitude like unless give conditions make easy work there.

It’s pure capitalism: make money, need hardest working, loyal staff.

I personally know anyone young (18-20s) adult category gotten it. Everyone know 30+. middle adult age bracket side effects seem be. know way 70+ year olds zero side effects. (My Mema swollen arm, also breast cancer &amp; swells whenever anything arm.) But, teken younger crowd. objectively incorrect. care, simple net search do. Problem care. so, CNN people trust get free pass without scrutiny push-back. mRNA absolutely longterm tests back it, potential longterm side effects sobering ignore. Plus immunity lawsuits, incentive make truly safe vaccine? None. incentive make fast. Think. Many people seem struggling concept lockdowns, analogy:

Someone arterial bleed, apply bandages/compress bleeding stops. mean cured? No! soon remove bandage/compress, bleeding start again. mean bandages work? No!!! need keep bandage wound heals (zero Covid), surgery (vaccinations).

Sorry mira offended you, yes people choices. going put world hold hand full people can’t get vaccine due medical reasons?... sorry also reduce risk infection, symptoms transmission too. say won’t allowed participate society”

That pretty much definition society group individuals involved persistent social interaction, large social group sharing spatial social territory, typically subject political authority dominant cultural expectations.

Pharmacies get supplies directly Feds, administration declared teachers eligible, pharmacies like CVS changed policy states next day, even states open teachers, like Massachusetts.

Shortly states opened supplies teachers. Mild discomfort aside. 

Masks poison social events. 

Like particularly care masks transportation, flights, stores, stuff like that's mild discomfort get way aside that.

People generally go bars, restaurants, stadiums, things like solitary experience. Eh that’s easy sounds. Vaccinated peoples SPREAD COVID-19. damn research, please. expect people locked every single person around world vaccinated? Public Health mission 100% cooperation mere dream. never eradicate virus, make transmission low greater population affected. One months vaccines easily available everyone, 100% re-open. I'm burning masks. European, I'd like weep comparing shipments :( easy dismiss anyone's opinion hand say part culture war. *cries german*  Thanks! split 50/50 2? Yep.. got big box kf94s they're amazing. Said weeks ago.  need deploy J&amp;J ice cream trucks loaded 1000 doses day. One done. hear music age feel free roll sleeve. type person ""let google track return conveniences"", you? know difference foot fetish wanting see people's faces talking them. Come on. majority healthy population catching disease makes feel bit shit days necessarily bad thing. It’s prob even effective vaccine given spreads exponentially. time it’s hilarious people saying making comment smart phone. 

Do think currently aren’t tracking movement now? Fauci already signaled federal government going create vaccine passport. major airlines already said require vaccine domestic travel (although countries likely require vaccine enter may need one international travel). Schools may may require it. require yearly flu vaccine children. major employer far come said they're going require vaccine. 

I wish places mentioned would require vaccine least US, vaccine unlikely required places. Low vaccine effectiveness due Hoskins effect strain prediction failure included? That’s nuts! someone least somewhat paying attention worldwide tragedy; biggest historical event occur lifetime? there's place people happily going barefoot last hundred years, government requires restaurants require shoes - yes, there's sense letting restaurants fully open. too. Rough day... Dead cat bounce. long incredible read. even half things true massive culture problem plant. going get pushback vaccine masks. tell people ""here throw cloth face"" reasonable person fight you.


There multiple huge reasons uncomfortable vaccine passport/requirement. Plus, varification taking place people trying normal...it'll hard enforce.

Schools sure, they're shown admitted never again, entirely different beast needing go local bar. holding months now. Well. Vaccine wise kickin ass. far virus suppression, objectively biggest failure world, though Europe saying hold beer. falls “common sense health measures” masks example used broader measures could include anything. Whatever happened ""unoquivocally protecting others, yourself"". applies masks, vaccines? Covid deniers always restrictions. shouldn’t worry think, public health. Canada painfully slow rollout largely result federal governments ineptness vaccine procurement lack investment domestic manufacturing (among numerous issues). provinces administering vaccines remarkably fast, isn’t supply go faster. using 4 month interval doses. It’s really fault federal government. It’s insane. check post history, screaming things time last year.

Kept getting told trust experts, watched wrong every key moment, slow react.

Do know old apartments East Coast cities massively overpowered radiators? supposed keep place warm windows open, built aftermath 1918 pandemic.

We knew sunlight ventilation worked antibiotics. still work. Setting hospitals let patients outside, airflow rooms would likely improve outcomes across board. viewership post-Trump they’re probably editorially concerned. like Florida honestly kids home ones getting short end stick. teachers (rightfully) give attention kids actually class online kids essentially watching live video what's going classroom. Knowing would like enough convince kids would get better education person. I'm bit sad since vaccines report cards super easy forge. There's 'seal authenticity' anything them

If easily forge card passport bases data cards pointless? people get vaccinated, better odds get. mom MSNBC. She’s constantly completely anxious scared. Every day sends new article variant another. feel bad- it’s exhausting scared time. think she’s starting receptive good news though. went gym first time year day. Something reduction supply AstraZeneca (not sure reason reduction, paid much attention pathetic childish arguing EU UK all), think 'models' used predict many people would vaccinated certain date ended tiny bit optimistic. Good. states come early on, less likely actually happen. enjoy seeing person's feet. wear shoes restaurant interferes that. 

So restaurant fully open requires shoes? would argue people wearing masks absence statewide mandate, proves statewide mandate effect. considered telling friend we've already third peak cases.... Haha. Nope. year later abundantly clear U.S. handled correctly hands approach. California announced lifting restrictions starting June 15, Canadians can’t find damn vaccine life depended Europe remains locked outside Sweden, who, oh look that, also took hands approach like U.S. UK, people complain mask less spreading it, 98% masks worn correctly. want someone blame. Biden administration next week launch funeral assistance program provide $9,000 cover burial costs American died covid-19 — largest program type ever offered federal program open families regardless income, long show documentation already received similar benefits another program. “Although cannot change happened, affirm commitment help funeral burial expenses many families anticipate,” acting FEMA administrator Bob Fenton said statement. I'm still confused. vaccine covid developed months safe? vaccine HIV something like developed years? I'm anti-vax i'm curious So... absolute definition lockdown environment work? Lol. Also, side note, worked nurse prison systems. prisoners absolutely everything power get infected gives power system possibility release sympathy builds enough. Nope. Okay it’s insane go another country vaccinated come back without test. Trust darn CDC card America. Absolutely ridiculous say concerned health fellow americans

No, think personal freedom trumps community's health, aka, fuck everyone can't vaccines. Winnie's still Queenstown? This. see people get this. accidentally drifted close someone grocery store line shouted needed ""to keep six feet!!!"" apologized, buddy, we've Trader Joe's least 10-15 minutes breathing air slow-moving line. Me, masked individual, accidentally 3 ft away instead 6ft going gives you, double-masked individual, coronavirus. Eye exam. aren’t fully reopening. “Common sense health measures likes masks still remain”

Lord knows falls “common sense health measures” enjoy people's company talking lots people, seeing face absolutely interferes way shirts pants not. mention much harder hear loud setting, trouble hearing people bars masks. masks I'm going able hear anyone. choose international travel, probable way meeting hundreds people around world closed environment many hours?

Is hypocrisy meter broken? New York Times daily newsletter great measured perspectives things. It’s free keeps updated biggest news stories. really like they’ve handling virus vaccine rollout. CNN exaggerated! *clutches pearls* “Common sense health measures remain”

Uhhhh classifies “common sense” 

Large event restrictions? Social distancing? Masks?

This isn’t fully reopening like seem think. Why? 
Because mortality worry about. long term effects infection still widely known and... again... mutations. already living wave caused 2 variants making younger folks sicker, mutate again. plenty reasons try keep everyone safe. children usually die covid mean nothing protect them. Lol seriously. approval rating 50. Grey Davis like 20 percent approval Arnold fantastic candidate compared jokes running newsom Called Walgreens number today check changing 28 day scheduled 2nd dose 21 days. news stories indicate Walgreens working scheduling problem indication change weekend hopefully. able speak human phone access availability databases scheduling, she, questioning, said access data 6 days prior website. said call DAY 21 days try reschedule obviously flawed. allowed us reschedule 15 days first dose new appointments become available 6 days sure would better. suspect something like might happen next iteration scheduling website. Yeah, would like see data US population covers broader demographic sample take study gospel. US study found 80% efficacy two weeks first dose involved relatively narrow subset population, namely approx. 4,000 ""health care personnel, first responders, essential frontline workers."" 

On one hand, large sample size likely exposed specific variants circulating US, think there's reason doubt 80% result valid.

But healthcare personnel first responders significantly different set potential exposure risks vast majority people. 

I seen much UK Israel studies; know anything demographics study participants? things keep going way been, going business usual California June 15 probably sooner rest country.  figured required vaccines like events no? religion prophets dead, cults alive update AZ ""irregularity"" figures compare Pfizer? recall early comparison showed extremely similar blood clot numbers 2 vaccines, yet AZ one crucified Pfizer remained unscathed least comes PR. Doubt hold. People already wearing masks. fair, localized use vaccine passport state run decision, city/county one lot moving parts travel. 

If DFW requires passport another area doesn't, traveling area becomes difficult since people might passport. businesses require it, one business another doesn't, lowers opetion shut entire city.

That makes overall strain state one areas requiring something rest state isn't. That's one done state level. Without staying home still apply best practices better.  totally people want masks forever. states solely want listen medical experts, consider quality life wearing masks makes perfect sense strictly medical standpoint. think states like California masks going anywhere anytime soon. That’s nuts Australia. 

I’m originally Germany. Every summer visit sweat balls relatives whine heat. tell get aircon, proceed tell never gets hot Germany. Haha. 

Here US summers get super hot. school went till 8th grade aircon, tolerable ideal. also fully vaccinated healthcare workers stands so? 

In example, wear something public health reasons interfere primary purpose business exceptions would. That's like masks. 

The person's examples anything like that, public health purpose stuff like preventing hearing music concert. modern anti-vaccination movement really started 1998 Andrew Wakefield. CNN drama.

Interesting. lead, I'll start thanks outlining detail. started little snarky, apologies, I'm seriously interested concept.

I expect unique amount organization put method. Kudos sort skill. expectation folks simply order ad hoc coordinate trips even consider it. Hence hesitation embracing convenience model home delivery.

I would interested deeper analysis actual footprint sort setup compared others. one trip mentioned automatically become less there's 'less cars packed roads' (i.e. electric vehicle versus diesel delivery truck). factors included well could include additional packaging (one box house, boxes I'm store, plastic packaging foods, etc.) generally I'd agree likely sustainable model. concern emerges delivery misses something, undermine process additional trip, etc.

I’m sorry don’t understand science epidemiology, please don’t lash Yeah, good point. NPR favorite, although it’s TV. know counts logic fallacy

False equivalence? 

It's form informal fallacy, that's long list ways people dumb someone thinks anti-vaxxers dangerous morons, think also completely insane. can't let employers force medial procedures people. White people really deep end triple masked get it, exactly? What? wasn’t even talking vaccines. read PDF? Bus tickets lot cheaper hospital bill, maybe even cheaper driving. Right. read Caitlyn Jenner considering running. Again, means nothing haha. logic, never allow government regulate anything, EVER fear would irreversibly over-regulate it. thing. Walgreens system wouldn’t let reschedule scheduled “2nd dose only” via CVS. Damn, that’s lot. luxury car right pants face, mask nethers.

/s Michigan’s Fall/Winter wave rather mild compared surrounding states, presumably government enacted significant restrictions. think they’re experiencing delayed outbreak essentially racing clock vaccines. lockdowns masks? Yeah, I've enough, thanks. Jump car take trip Tennessee, luxury waiting there. apply bars clubs? Everyone still needs stay home. still get flu shot? one thing? Anthony ""Magic 8 Ball"" Fauci says: 42 states pay happening bad thing want able get back normal and

Back normal coming, ""vaccine passports"" not. vaccination numbers continue rise, restrictions continue especially international travel.

Well good thing states control international travel vaccination passports, that's solely hands feds. Yeah mean sure, maybe! Plenty conspiracy theories founded upon real facts. become conspiracy theories presented way push specific agenda/viewpoint form sort implication mere association. Like McDonalds paid millions millions lawsuits settlements mean I'm gonna die eating french fry, ya know? 
 
I'm trying discredit facts say anything specifically, I'm responding question comment conspiratorial. definition, yeah is! Plus many stores require them. think people wearing masks continued wear them. doubt government mandate ever made huge difference.  read AP News Reuters. aren’t perfect, tend focus facts opinion. state isn’t one them. I’ve wanted one since starting released. you’re greater philadelphia area you’d know i’m talking about. everyone luxury state readily available vaccines right now. forgot /s texans that? Someone official capacity state Texas that? No...schools kids scan vaccine passport everyday...

And government, fact app 100% storing data, blind data/privacy breaches recent years? realize can’t. given power, power say “nope” lose. now? False, read anything pro-vaccine (as taken mine) - also pro-choice someone get vaccine chose without Big Gov asking vaccine passport. 

That's is, sorry can't get vaccine Mira, life goes eventually vaccine can't get vaccine youll accept people's choices. also choice live inside forever fear (which 100% respect), know? biggie surprised see Texas absent list. denial COVID19 even exists, idea fake disease created liberal media destroy Trump, 

I lived Texas outbreak pandemic. None true. one thought, least verbalized, ideas assigning them.

This weird, hate filled, post might culturally ethnically diverse state US. US state monolith, Texas assuredly not. I'd prefer things *at least* 2019 standards, yes universities employers may require FDA-approved vaccines.

For example, state chickenpox vaccine required child previously infected disease. addition, vaccines may skipped medical exemption, may skipped due conscientious objections. standards apply colleges.

I okay vaccines required long as:

1. FDA-approved

2. allows reasonable exceptions

3. Unvaccinated students treated unfairly different due vaccination status happening bad thing want able get back normal especially international travel. already are. Try sending kid public school overseas without usual vaccines. different. countries listed either islands authoritarian regimes. tell us realistic is. won’t fly democratic countries. American bringing back, right? Americans well pandemic, best. That’s quite stretch. Um, not? whole states giving anyone wants one. 

Do want one? Say, friend, heard developing world migrant crisis Europe? I'm doom team anything, lot work remains done. behoves us, vaccinated, get shoes get thing done. nah still months away anti vaxxers time takes vaccinate everyone going out. 

But well pace majority protected  Well seem know lot even though dont live Yeah, pharmacies around that. mass vaccination sites ask ID insurance all. thing person arrive mask appointment. (It's listed required, suspect pants non-optional well.) There’s zero viruses running wild ability overwhelm health system weeks too. 

Getting pissy stuff culture war. It’s international health catastrophe. wear cloth face maybe show card prove aren’t going kill people breathing like four months. Big bad we’re best America, bested napkin. It’s depressing, American watch half country turn entitled children talk shit people fucking suffer food every day, get it, like somehow beneath us. 
It’s bullshit. Probably tcell antibodies would think. They’re verifiable facts. Probably holidays, people mixing different areas. Last year stayed away part people saw 90% distancing masks. Democrats: beautiful sunny day outside.

GOP : Ban sun  know sure we're good seems frankly short sighted complain it.

What threshold good? Unless willing physically force people take vaccine, everyone wants it, that's end. overwhelming consensus COVID endemic. never zero COVID. HIV replicates, therefore mutates, fast, generally adapted avoiding immune Thank opinion rambling comment Reddit expert! seeing connection comment related poster though.  practical level, schools universities require vaccination. basically prevents state run universities adding COVID already long list vaccinations require.

It also feeds conservative conspiracy mindset, disastrous vaccination rate whole. dunno, according coworker means researchers scientists need go back drawing board halt vaccinations meantime. scrutinize driver's licenses/state id's vaccination sites neck woods. cares probably much urgency left approve vaccines. 3 far, AZ Novavax coming, we're projected shots available every adult wants one end May. FDA endless resources review new drug applications, certain point, they're going move getting sixth vaccine start focusing on, say, new cancer drugs. popular hardly Covid cases months still restricted? think popular restrictions still seen necessary left leaning people, cases go people want keep up. Oxygen running yet, consequence hospitals overwhelmed. oxygen produced within 100 miles hospital shipped liquid. there's oxygen shortage today, medical one suppliers can't meet demands region. Michigan stretching infrastructure now. reaching highest rates infections. likely means it'll stress hospital capacity too, could test systems levels tested before. That's things break.

On flip side. Oxygen suppliers getting better shipping hot spots local supplies run low. usually possible one hot spot. Michigan may get lucky truly severe peak may able get shipments elsewhere. may not. Ny, tx ca deal oxygen shortages last year. less developed countries far common concern. Search oxygen crisis. would get politics said safer to. possible polite friendly someone's actual friend. Maybe higher bar consider friendship. live antivaxxor area, covid vaccine easy get flu shot Oh absolutely is, however mentioned certain sects redditors lose fucking shit mention it. man plan... get rid ""reopening"" terminology? dumb simplistic. ""Lift public covid restrictions"" maybe? could. minister, avoid voicing political viewpoints. starting find useful. smile strangers time. People leave alone more. single comment looks year. kept face warm winter. silver lining suppose. vaccine! second dose worse body shouts “OMG RECOGNIZE STUFF - ATTACK!”

For already COVID, it’s opposite- first vaccine worse, recognizes disease. second one body kind already! there. Done that. think purely way knowing vaccinated isn't. certain level vaccination reached society unnecessary. Boy don’t understand. 

As soon I’m vaccinated it’s summer bought weekend trips Texas. teacher gang! feel like beneficial might been, think better. Mostly yes would harder fake, would much discourse every side life. Whether think COVID conspiracy whether think it’s one hoop many jump through. personally think time would efficiently get figured out, would already outlived purpose moot point. Ah hope right mean summer seasonality?

Sorry obvious terminology; I've avoiding sub past months mental health. honest 246/1.57million bit optimistic denominator increased time (on Jan 1st likely zero fully vaxxed people, besides maybe clinical trials). still, consistent 90+% efficacy. can't true. trustworthy anti-maskers told Newsom fetish lockdowns. Canada month behind US vaccinations per capita, hopefully reach point second half May. Good good holes frozen bags absurdly annoying, lol. I'm legitimately amazed considers enforceable reasonable. I'm slowly becoming convinced governors think vaccines junk fifty fifty shot working. get it.

I got Pfizer vaccine. Throw small room ""900 unvaccinated people."" I'm confident catch virus trust one single effective vaccines medical history. he? serious symptom. one main symptoms keeping people working normally resuming normal physical activity. coworker go leave 2 times fatigued work normally “recovering” COVID.  logical know ratios personally yes herd immunity help summer seasonality helps well. likely complete non issue. There’s also variants consider mass vaccination site Pittsburgh asked insurance, I'm pretty sure would still fine. one posting daily updates separate posts. change want see. I’m saying theory won’t work actuality won’t work.

Trying get global population sync never happen. still waiting world peace, right?

Covid still killing kids significant numbers. never 100% safe take ibuprofen. People treat like safe medicine, contributes severe, even crippling issues digestive tract. 

There study published last week showed acetaminophen placebo effect true pain management. said, reduce effectiveness dose long take 24 hours shot. didn’t. federal government many opportunities private sector comes vaccine domestic production well facilities could invested in, instead chose put eggs one basket, National Research Council, 6 months behind schedule shitty Pretty sad. guess it’s noticeable since didn’t open much lot states chose instead we’re spotlight, got unlucky big bad variants. I’m kind surprised took long even liberal town, would frequently see kind small gatherings happening scientists said drive spread without masks. we’ve apparently chosen path riding vaccines save butts.  Gwenyths vagina. Horrible Oh, ok. think 500,000 people died katrina. ya, would more.

but fund there, said. always supposed used national disasters, looked mother died found trump administration said could used covid related deaths.

probably trying say covid big deal. scale natural disaster.  go graph [deaths hover day see many deaths reported. Reported deaths Christmas surrounding days less half before. Biden really showed tactic extremely disappointing goal ""100,000,000 doses 100 days"" getting doubled. I’m Republican that’s ridiculous perspective. properly. *Find, test, trace, isolate, support.* I’d recommend research - 90%+ remote companies this. region live isn’t protected class lol. company even publishes salary modifiers populous countries North America Europe. biannual performance reviews salary also adjusted moved somewhere significantly different cost living. 

I’d love see discrimination lawsuit. “I got paid less I’m gay!” “Yeah yeah, got paid less I’m Albuquerque!”. people are. local hospital asks copy insurrance states there's ""admin fee"" receiving vaccine either charged insurrance billed directly. also fine print legally allowed deny vaccine inability pay/being uninsured. 

My local mass-vaccination site requires ID, run county county residents. suspect ID address verification. I'm going say way explained people much smarter conveyed well enough here. saying meant. OTOH, coronavac good preventing serious illnesses deaths.  Yeah, perfect comparison, right. However, wiping stuff easy, plus commercial buildings get thousands visitors day I'm personally happy it. Sounds like Trump Would say like one three people acting like that? Unlike many countries (including mine, Brazil), getting ID card US easy free people. many states, driver's license de facto ID. people drive, alternatives, still cost money easy get. wouldnt stress much. may even caught it. Even June 15 may pushing depending availability appointments much brand given (since different dosing schedules). smarter thing would set (in consultation scientists) percentage population needs vaccinated open instead arbitrary date. Right. believe Live Free Die. operate way - people LCOL areas willing take less. Otherwise it'd form discrimination. Plus, Bay Area expats know value good luck getting cheaper moving Idaho pursue FIRE. want point out, 16-18 get Pfizer shot. Make sure book appointment give. lovely task trying get two appointments twins specific locations. 3.9% 7 day positive rate.  
If don’t virus don’t virus No, mean people cannot get yet cus live. World Health Organization, pretty much world access vaccine time soon, especially poorer countries. post pandemic party bigger: mask burning bye bye here's middle finger Zoom? Jair Bolsonaro spends days protecting virus' interests.  approve great reset Texas seems like Texans. Yes agree this. Damn sucks bad— days away immune happens!! Made whole year !! Ugh  Periodically paying fee lot different constantly wiping every surface building terms resources time expended.  opening door dining cases increasing. 
 Wishful thinking schools. 

And 35k tests day 1 year that's driving it.

It's human behaviour driven wave.

We watched thing play South boarder variants craze. notice timeframe June 1st June 15th (middle June). Yeah, study recently first responders monitoring well vaccines working, showed significant decrease infection vaxxed control group. actually testing people covid, rather looking symptoms. so, less likely get infected, means can’t spread it. still wait see data corroborate it, it’s good sign you’re vaxxed, don’t really need use precautions. Hopefully info comes soon! reddit. person responded probably like 19 gets entire worldview website. minimum compare 7 day rolling average 7 day average day  Same. would come back person vaccinated early. anxiety pretty much gone I'm still worried may get it, I'm worried dying. please use common sense once? vaccines stop transmission taking case numbers exploding? mean, 3 brutal days. Shot 10am Friday. Midnight fever hit, broke day Saturday, finally broke overnight Saturday. Sunday felt worn slight headache nap ton water helped. Woke Sunday night drenched sweat must've slight fever point. Monday worn massive headache tapered day. Feel pretty much fine today. also bad allergies though hitting part I'm sure. Bullshit fall school going full go Yes Yeah still buy insurance don’t you? you’re playing non contact outdoor sport use locker rooms anything close quarters would need quarantine someone positive? Especially kids wearing masks. I’m thinking little kids soccer baseball. culturally weird drink human breast milk baby it’s riskier drinking milk bought farmer’s market. new 18/21 year olds tiktok dances. Sounds hilarious. agree, even Biden federal government little power actual restrictions, besides sectors Id say possible vaccine keeps working covid also attempts replicate. want think time show symptoms you’ve developed even antibodies could lessen severity. purely speculation tested positives trials around 14 day mark likely actually came contact 5-7 days before, around 6-7 day mark. matters reporting purposes since previous holidays low cases deaths. It’s like deaths actually magically dropped 800 200 sudden. Yeah, state administration assume (perhaps optimistically) also collect necessary data make work. far know private sector vaccinations, 20 year old counter doesn’t give shit data integrity. He’s paid enough check papers turn away. 

Also generally tough problem. There’s unique identifier people US. SSN closest thing it, there’s still people without it. mention, can’t ask without clearing minimum requirement trustworthiness. States identifiers federally undocumented people, give state city ids pretty much anyone. 50 separate databases, still don’t cover everyone. 

Basically none America’s infrastructure designed support interstate vaccine passports. Intrastate, supplement actual passport seem like reasonable outcomes since it’s least clear would implement those: states, department state. Right, there’s steady rise (or drop) day, number reported Monday 3 times normal daily change. unvaccinated people risk, reason passport. Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursed burial costs before, never offered large payment many people. 2017, example, FEMA paid $2.6 million 976 people funeral costs victims three hurricanes — average $2,664 per applicant. We've waited long time hear this. Flying see mom (and take son see Grandma) soon antibodies start popping!

We couldn’t go last year. son says “Mom, go see grandma, know, *you never know.”* want response work needs national level. big part problem US. They're talking vaccination card foreign visitors, QR Code-based apps US citizens basically anything. getting vaccinated, still risk losing taste smell get Covid? Colonel obviously speaks hoggish bumper sticker talking points. totally ignores danger variants pose. Keep oversimplifying things please! :) Legally, would required to. Whether follow rules another question. Yeah I'm tiny minority even take high end estimates 80% efficacy two weeks first dose (and frankly we've seen estimates ranging low 50% studies, although strongly believe likely somewhere around 70-80% range), getting second dose waiting another week two get 95% efficacy actually pretty substantial difference. Like second shot reduces chances getting sick *at least 75%* one shot, *up 90%* studies lower protective estimates corrrct. Personally think waiting *year* indoor dining, means risk tolerance probably pretty low, think makes sense still kind conservative extra *two three weeks* get additional 75% 90% protection going indoor restaurant whatever.

I've gotten lot pushback point past though, recognize I'm tiny minority. new hospitalizations, people hospital currently, state report number go zero like would cases, assumed day before. Biden White House: [no federal vax-pass feel sooo much safer fully vaccinated classroom. It’s also cool see fourth graders wear masks day long doesn’t bother bit. Although still half students staying virtual rest year (parents choice) it’s still big step towards normalcy schools. Obviously right method according else would control. 

If 12 months hasn’t worked? think mask mandates go everywhere point July. Probably early month. experience. people use work social outlets absolutely bent everyone going back. TL;DR

1. Make sure information correct

2. Put somewhere safe

3. Make photocopy.

Done. controlled vs. unavaccinated healthcare workers, general population. Healthcare know spreads using airborne precautions. talking about? haven’t one looked like something movie doesn’t mean hospitals haven’t exceeded capacity checked friend got second shot yesterday. reaction first shot except sore arm, symptoms I’m time. She’s miserable. Weird. hope worst it. eyeballs feel like going pop head nose stopped now. It’s amazing fast symptoms zooming body. me, headache worst part. keep intermittent fevers hit break sweat. It’s like hot flashes steroids. hope ends soon. Agreed.

Collaboration best person solving problem--fluid comms key fully replicated zoom/other.

Everything else execution need person--focus key.

My ideal scenario 1-2 days week most, office. Yeah, sense people general say this, there’s clear incentive say you’re productive.

Studies relying self-reported data employees shown case, though it’s possible yours. Here's fun promotion that's timely given National Beer Day Wednesday: Get COVID shot get free Samuel Adams beer brand released new national TV spot “Your Cousin Boston Gets Vaccinated” Wednesday ""to help combat skepticism amongst drinkers humor"" announced #ShotForSam vaccine incentive **A couple caveats: free beer COVID-19 vaccine offer starts April 12 – National Beer Day held annually April 7 – first 10,000 drinkers ""share evidence vaccination social media"" May 15 supplies last.** respectful joke, funny IMHO Ah, old logical fallacy. truly think active God, think active God involved making vaccine? I'm saying bad, saying need this. main idea behind get anti-vaxxers get vaxxed. problem position science secondary Facebook memes. Dude maybe headline problem guess figured going history  30, understand. small chance also high cost family happen -- let's marginalise deaths. unemployment % tells remote worker choice post-pandemic. return office need find new place work. really idea commuting living big city works. 

Chicago example, we’ve got tons highways trains coming burbs, 50 mile commute come 45 minutes take metro. 

Also housing almost tripled size money burbs.  Might stupid question move somewhere closer instead wasting like 10 000 hours life like that? masses men living lives quiet desperation. Put pool ""Would quit ever set foot office again."" Indeed. That's case EU though. speaking prospective employers industry desparate hire people. got subject money asked one raises worked. 

For reasons still unclear me, blatantly admitted ""cap"" high raises go seems entirely dependent *your time* company based performance anything else. stayed company 10 years, reward decade loyalty was... pay longer keep inflation essentially make less less money every day. incentive.

But wait there's more. asked raises keep Consumer Price Index. speaking someone Human Resources *no fucking clue* CPI is. barely grasped inflation could tell playing dumb, sincerely understand stuff. 

Needless say didnt take job. one gives shit dude. Anyone who's ever worked food service knows lot challenging many office jobs, requires serious ability multitasking, mediation, sales, customer service, etc. accurate say lower barrier entry. 100% agree. think someone unhappy wfh employer planning continue remote work, need rethink rework way live life. can't dramatically change whole schedule make changes personal life reallocate time. workplace social interaction replaced... pick hobbies, start taking workout class, get involved HOA, start reaching family, join church, get involved PTA, join neighborhood association... list goes on. upside might actually able make connection people common rather coworkers small talk. first person I've seen actually *wants* interact co-workers. Plus Florida. increasing spite sun-belt. population-weighted density Sweden literally 3 times larger Finland, ok. manager control insecurity.

Bingo.  far away people shared hobbies also close enough people office? India reported record 115,736 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday, 13-fold increase two months, raising pressure government expand vaccination states, including hardest-hit Maharashtra Odisha, complained scarcity vaccines second wave forced centres turn away aged 45 immunised India, world’s biggest vaccine maker, started campaign health frontline workers “Vaccination centres close early due shortage supplies,” Maharashtra’s health minister, Rajesh Tope, told Stocks would run three days daily injection 450,000 doses, Odisha said closed nearly half immunisation sites due shortfall, supplies left two days. anyone. CYA Mofos doesnt cups ze cupboard saying this... Ontario trying pre-register... later date scheduled appointment future. Lots headache little progress.

I understand retirement homes ect first... point local news agency tell local population... 1000 vaccines day here... First come first serve.  people paying much commute almost every time living walking distance even expensive. Im US, however, i'm working home, work 1 day less per week, without expenses train i'm breaking even. 32 hours week work versus 40 hours work 15 commuting. going back life. Although 4000 people huge number also know typical day 7500 Brasilians die, COVID deaths additional deaths. 4000 COVID deaths probably really show outside hospitals, morgues graveyards. bet average citizen feeling like slammed - except fight virus lose relatives. asssume Eastern Europe.

There's plenty news Estonia Czechia European media people somewhat used already. Outburst here, another there. least EU people risk groups gotten first jab reduce mortality significantly. ex Soviet countries whole another story. people recharge batteries socializing people whose charge drains faster social scenarios need time alone ( I’m latter). 

The introversion-extroversion axis largely myth derived mediocre, century-old psychology. 

Even person invented terms believed overwhelming majority people neither. pick boundary? give people choice. acknowledge AZ good vaccine wait those. People suddenly quit. someone wants WFH job, they'll find one first, they'll quit non-WFH job. 35% population can't afford quit jobs nothing else lined up. Thank 65 rate still climbing decent pace although slowed down, imagine level low 80s May. .... again. Reread comments. issue YEARS people care it’s low income issue There's reason they've heavy travel restrictions past year! /s vast majority jobs home pointless makework; bullshit jobs. 

Maybe catalyst get people realize much better species? Much better, ""not destroy civilization species"", we're busy going capitalism now.

[The Free World Charter](http://www.freeworldcharter.org), [The Venus Project](http://www.thevenusproject.com) [the Zeitgeist Movement](http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com). comment example situation, think infer case everyone. company work people want go back office ones miss social interactions, may make people happy needed get job done shown increased productivity last year. get jobs much easier get back office, case hope soon vaccines becoming available. 

Side note gamer played games online like 15 years something good friends decade still regularly keep touch despite playing games anymore, absolutely build relationships people electronically. it’s everyone. I'm basically boat, know we've moved past covid stage indoor sports places open up, social interaction fixed without office. indoor sports week group friends (sport varies season) games hang bar extra hour so. That's enough me. never want step foot office again. job already said likely happen 2022 anyways. that's almost 2 years initial wfh order. job remotely close 2 years, would go office?

I'm saving much time without commute, getting chores done around house breaks, spending time family, sleeping more, work. see downside wfh forever. would say talk doctor type concern rather people internet. Thanks fair, (US workers) put hours week many countries. get two days week average rather three. 

My workplace (a public library) transitioned everyone back normal hours June last year, really difficult adjust. Took month get back swing things, even felt exhausted work week pandemic began.

I kind wished hell we've would've lead systemic changes, naivety get where, suppose. Like suspended put ISS? 100% this. lot time I'm running reports macros would normally use time browsing web since can't anything excel time. I'm home get little tasks way. Plus ever work late, I'm already home take 5 minute break hang wife play dogs, WAY better mental health sitting cubicle day. Nobody would *want* to. option scenario quitting job, though. can't refuse get another vaccine. I'll pretty much guaranteed AZ vaccine now. number 4211 deaths registered yesterday, 6th. don´t think go farther that. It’s always big scale. It’s low income issue sudden people care. guess it’s good thing like mustard never liked ketchup 😜 ""Prof Mike Weed University Canterbury, studied 27,000 Covid-19 cases, says outdoor gatherings safe accompanied proper risk management."" right outdoor better indoor, nuance things. Also, variants like P1 efficiently bind ACE2 receptor, would also factor risk management. understand exponential growth % positive cases leading hospitalisation. know point hit ""lockdown"" avoid massive overrun. done three times already lockdowns.

Right antithesis point continue open per roadmap. within company. manager gave .25 raise, said wished could more. Went different department. Ended 2.25 wfh. Much better! Old school, man. There's still companies think anyone working home. Old school mindset company one them. came back think May full-time ever since. They're afraid productivity would fall cliff without micromanaging half day meetings. Yeah know. Coincidentally April study rule outdoor transmission virus. However, among 7,324 identified cases China sufficient descriptions, one outdoor outbreak involving two cases occurred village Shangqiu, Henan. 27-year-old man conversation outdoors individual returned Wuhan 25 January onset symptoms 1 respectable caveats, however. nobody spends time outdoors winter, going trace outdoor transmissions. outdoor transmission probably harder trace indoor. here. covid worked remotely, would still go office time time. miss seeing friends person occasional office potlucks. Yes, I'd even less risk Pfizer Moderna. see ""ah higher risk dying covid"" particularly compelling reason take vaccine risk death others available. Could also people really like coworkers 480 dollars monthly train ticket

Nearly $6000 year ride train work *insanity.* Nope, I’m middle management. DREAD going back office. folks pushing upper management pissed can’t break lease real estate without taking bath “Fuck everybody else, bring asses back pay”! Montréal, Canada

No traffic : 35min

Living outside city : $750 month 3 1/2 (rent, buying) 

Living city : $1050 month 3 1/2 (500 square foot)

If want buy 3 1/2 outside city : $170'000

In city : $260'000 Yes. decisions made hallways meetings. dislike that, reality I've deal I've essentially worked home since beginning (except started opted work site first half year). okay going along flow one make changes, fine work home. still make changes, nearly easily would person whatever reason. Bummer. Oh well. Reddit hivemind giveth, taketh away people tend short memories. Brazil reach herd immunity point (either vaccinations natural immunity). he'll potentially year push propaganda election. I'd bet lot people still vote him. sounds like you’re alone boat. 

We’ve built work-centric society large number people get social interaction work instead places. 

I don’t think that’s healthy all. Clearly never met Scotsman. Can't imagine gonna make much difference, people tend pretty willing take anything comes cancer. said, treatments may replaced mRNA technology - BioNTech Moderna originally founded research mRNA cancer drugs, vaccine successes, imagine they'll getting lot funding. know controversial comment post 100% right. Throughout pandemic found lot jobs thought done domestically actually done overseas save money. example marketing television advertisements online ads done Philippines ad companies pay workforce like $2 hour clip together edit ads see every day. go cnn search live updates. place work still day advertises give performance based raises every 3 months, never done year half I've worked Can’t. Already middle program Same. never want work general population again. Even office would work 5 mins away. 

Just able smoke Pajamas day amazing. hit car? rough time first dose afraid get 2nd it. pretty much told needed man brave got it. Glad did, ended side effects second shot little tired. 

PS gets really bad take ibuprofen, you’ll fine. would quit then?? bounce around work sites finishing assignment nowhere new go basically decided give WFH mandate. notice I'm site month still get tasks done, reason allow WFH.  That’s 110% pandemic gone since early days states. today. *Rather quit?!* would take long find WFH job paying mine pays I'd lose seniority. I'm amazed many people disposable job. H-053-R variant. last percentage obviously important one. mean, that's 3% shift needed though based account. vaccinate amount week. I'm sure whole season later attitudes shifted 3% given that. thing unskilled labor. aren’t checked though. truant, whole year. Weird, I'm also software dev work remotely - work devs countries, usually talk problems phone send emails questions. Guess depends team workflows. see waterfall agile development processes! 😭 🤣 I'm jealous.. I'm hour way traffic prepandamic. 40-45 minutes bad I'm used far far worse(older jobs would hour 15-20 minute drive way. drove nuts. 

I sincerely even think driving aspect return full time office. stressing finding childcare messing wife's ability work well. would huge change go back drive main issue would certainly part Serbia make vaccinating foreigners regular thing. government urging people apply. think really sad think make friends work. lot people know met long time friends spouses via career. Putting wall necessary giggled first time covid joke lol.

That's first! Thank you. That's useful study. probably kick cat around room know, super off-brand even aside slacking off, actually productive work life. working home want take quick breather go throw load laundry in, get cuddles dog. feels like productive use break. 


I come back office last month complete shit show trying get basic errands done... made one month commuting jackass rearended me. car done shop today, get car work late tonight leave 2 hours early tomorrow evening make way across town pick car close 5pm. still working home would literally matter logging 30mins usual start time, logging 30 minutes early. lifestyle nonsensical. free go somewhere else  different jobs function differently office home. 2nd Pfizer shot evening! wife excited! WEAR? :D Jokes them, I’ve got old coffee full them! It’ll perfect next apocalypse! Yes. Good expected news added bonus sincerely doubt country accept easily-forged, unsigned, little paper card proof vaccination (or proof anything else matter)

Many already accepting easily-forged, unsigned, printed negative covid test results. What’s difference? People like really bad home life. people live hoarders abusive, can’t afford live alone quite yet. then, 40+ hours week haven.

Once move year/two years though, yeah, screw working office. I’m looking arguments. completely insane it’s year later still limited 10%-20% capacity. NYC shut two months straight, one broke quarantine, yet still quarantining year later. definitely reduces spread dramatically; numerous examples this. Unenforceable orders may ignored though, cost high temporary last resort anyway. worst all, thing buy time - case may actually worthwhile since vaccines coming. people cry ""credible sources"" ""media bias"" ones gobble Facebook memes YouTube videos part ""research""

News never 100% without bias, humans researched wrote story, journalists hell better job college buddy shitposting Facebook Everyone trashes unions, except people unions. tell something. many european countries, pay like 50-100 euro public transport pass. Thats obviously use private travel Yes, thank situation bad yours, 20 minute packed train ride, mostly subsidized benefit paid $50/month. still want it. applied for, got approved, full-time work home post-covid. wake 15 minutes workday starts, soon done I'm already home. slow day I'm trapped office, accomplish things could never before. Plus things, like tempted purchase coffee everyday. estimate I'm saving ~$250/month (after-tax) even counting time saved. That’s personal preference though differ (which obviously fine). enjoy job, even remote office small talk cut down. 
If social interaction work hours something need happy, remote work obviously isn’t you. It’s basically introverted vs extrovert introverts benefited pandemic social level it’s taking toll extroverts. Look prior influenza season compared neighboring regions you’ll answer. 

Besides, compare covid mortality Luxenburg Belgium. different, neighbouring countries. claim nordic countries homogenous simply exaggeration. 

It’s ok say don’t know. could factors even genetics might play role. ya got gf part 34%. Fortunately jobs see value increased productivity it’s looking like able continue working remotely.

The time money savings great. save nearly 7 hours commuting each. also plenty time prepare dinner, mow various chores workday automations running.

I realize every job conducive remote work feel fortunate. sentence pure nonsense. linked study leisure time exercise Brasil. Two problems that. One: Brasil - representative that? Two: Leisure time tends lower women schedules tend fragmented. also implies wider range movements activities non-leisure time. Cool, thanks weighing in.  ""slackathon"" real. quite. Serbia offered AstraZeneca couple days, expiring pulled back offer. Still, welcomed help!
On hand, contract Sputnik V agreed signed, 40k delivered far. Cool. 
That get rid privileged douchebags weird conditions working make jobs available people aren’t living Cloudland. mean bit different. cost get returned rent nyc. Society turned bunch recluses work home shop home. Sad really exercise feel it. won’t make vaccine less effective  it’s really bothering take tylenol ibuprofen. Also weird thing quickly crappy feelings come go away fast well. felt like garbage one moment felt absolutely fine. like someone flipped light switch symptoms gone. 

I guarantee you’ll feel 99% better Friday.  Poor countries need vaccine doses money.

Then go acquire borrowing money exchanging goods/services them. care poor countries getting feel like fair vaccinate population entirely start exporting? That's understandable, pretend helping others significant way then.

I don't, care. 34%? know anyone wants go back office. Commute work really expensive (like 100 bucks month maybe train pass) none really bothers me. 10-20% hand gives shit them, it’s small amount. Yup. Work colleagues entire life social circle. fine... need understand colleagues colleagues lot us. Jesus people I'm talking like Unabomber level rural. much smaller towns. &lt;25,000 residents. even color TV now, believe not! commute hour one way. get lot done extra 10 hours week. go back, hope four day work week.

Plus train pass almost $200 month. that's big savings. sure. last job directly dealt 'institutional knowledge' side things. Companies general know important is. turn tables. Reddit (and internet general) introversion social anxiety often considered thing.

The truth plenty social introverts shy extroverts. matters derive energy.

I'm introvert. love social interaction. draining me, need alone become whole again. I'm still outgoing, friendly, well-liked. Try reading article commenting based headline. Majority willing take vaccine anytime becomes available 

Don't let stupid videos stupid politicians dictate really want. Extremists, science deniers still minority here. yet continue refuse DoD attempt negotiate terms would allow use vaccine doses outside U.S., cases, vaccine manufacturers refused know tangentially related. But, today first time year I'm getting together larger friend group. used called family dinner week Wednesdays. We'd watch survivor potluck meal. great way make week go faster, something look forward middle week. 

Well, stopped due pandemic. Two teachers, ones nurse, one works dentist office wife worked restaurant. risky get together. 

We vaccinated can't wait see people.

I'm supposed go back office June 1. That, looking forward to. productivity bad home asked hours cut hoping I’d get furloughed. WFH 4x10 could get into. never really liked idea in-office yes 3 day weekend, 4 hellish days including commuting. I’ve back office since October; currently interviewing remote work, since company believes work “only takes place office”. Hasn’t Hollywood thought guys anything. bad guy always British! British people attacked US spreading variant yes. not, Brits really give shit variant's called, problem. Good.

Put oxygen mask assisting others Taking bath cost. Aka losing lot money.

Major corps breaking commercial leases would likely factor hundreds thousands dollar millions depending location scale.

That said, would long term net savings tbh. office situations way expensive less efficient neccesary. smart corps pivot away large offices much possible. Yes, find enough unvaccinated healthcare workers control against? goes HCWs without prior antibodies. “Taking bath” basically means taking huge loss. older individuals theory would least effective (if more) younger individuals. single dose Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine reached 60% (95% CI 41% 73%) 28 34 days increased 73% (95% CI 27% 90%) day 35 onwards."" That's biggest one. office people shoot nerf darts time, desk middle crossfire. guy behind would go Trumpy political rants every day, including saying racist things Asians (when huge number coworkers Asian). free past year amazing. tHinK vACcinE sIdE EfFectS   IMO time-tracking apps become new norm WFH norm. Maybe even Hybrid. That’s lot nothing with.

The article interest - even [listed notable people cannot read article. Unfortunately job, working home mean working home. work game's industry able cart bunch consoles library cafe :( think meager 25 cent raise insult

I mean, extra $500 year full time. nearly enough 'raise' actual additional duties, bad, long actually inflation really taking paycut. Please, lies. Biden wants send vaccines, send vaccines. people want see little peons scurrying around. really hate client.

The great news business upcoming, free time able go park observe anthills. pretty close analogue.  can't really classify ""falling cracks"" happening half group. got Covid vaccine state supported site. get specifics, drive sports stadium. 

The process really easy fast. person giving shot didn’t appear switching gloves patients. normal?

She already opened band aid glove walked up. sure that’s normal?

And holding needle hand needle exposed, ready give shot (no protection clip) needle tip. normal?

And got Pfizer shot. needles profiles Pfizer? someone put needle vial fill up?

I’m sure I’m fine, feel like things bit “clean” I’ve gotten flu shots past. 

They super fast process easy, want make sure didn’t take shortcuts potentially stick dirty needle since walked car needle tip exposed. question joke. asking odds posted represented? think people realized effectively working 100+ overtime hours per year negative money don’t actually need job function would change conversation wfh. “Taking bath” means they’d take big financial loss. (Probably showing age)
But leased office space expensive get contract. Pinterest paid close $90,000,000.00 get contract San Francisco. Reddit reminds 80% people pretty normal, big group people *wild* ideas world works. moms friend college making daughter freeze eggs lets get vaccinated, absolutely insane lmao considering quitting even go part time office. worth it. work home take care health. know people finding wfh jobs. subsidize enough someone develop high fructose lettuce syrup. amount fructose lettuce veggies general zero, fairly low compared fruits. I'm going quit certainly something look new position. Basically pay come office full time justify necessary/beneficial.

It goes without saying commute time time spent work, even technically working. factor salary considerations. Abso-fucking-lutely. many them, world job. like hate life outside work, work coolest kid highschool something. So, make us work office create world them. Covid would send bullshit emails ""We miss much! can't wait reunited again!"" 

The entire time like ""I hope never ends."" hoped deep would realize work done, cut costs perhaps reduce real estate office, nah - want ""butts seats"" office mentality. shame. could nothing

So could productivity. Again, read article. want blame orange one

You're pushing pity party wholly unrelated. get it, be. healthcare sporting event. Sorry, really justify extra hour commute. Thanks! Social engineering acclimate masses Orwellian big tech panopticon. still hover peoples' heads, remotely? Like homes? curious here. It’s sunk cost anyway. What’s difference? don’t renew. mean, California Vermont gave dates full-on reopening. California said ""masks forseeable future"". Now, either they're saying intention lift mask mandate restrictions saying they're yet, order give people hope hut go crazy, intend actually keeping mandates. Guys, setup meeting standup CAb meeting next week discuss meeting meet next meeting.

Also, isn’t work getting done, need meet this. is! got CVS made easy. here. rented office space people want come in, otherwise work home XD Good god almighty give exact model right now. I'm looking barrel $6,600 cut yearly salary thanks company forcing us go back office every day. Yeah man, used Billings MT example turns way people would thought. like suburb Billings. Everybody acts like anything outside major metro area like Beverly Hillbillies US. 2021.

It really exposes kind inherent ignorance vast swathes country consist of. City folk really get city often. Go something fun like river rafting snowmobiling. There's whole awesome country explore (and perfectly adequate internet cell coverage!) She’s insane, dunno daughter thinks mother tells Don’t expect see huge shore jump. 

We tried early 2000’s horrible everyone involved. 

If think slack rough, try slack team people ESL massive churn rate. Oh shut up.

So that's then? got nothing? offer zero way argument, asking questions, get well thought answers, ""shut up""?

Spend little time questioning feel way. Fox News tell think? thinking virus catch it? know anybody who's gotten it? do. I've miserable flus 45 years, really want get they've gotten. I've basically checked job, bare minimum get ousted. Expectations workload increased year since company knew could squeeze work us due fears losing jobs pandemic. Atleast feel anyway. Depends enforced high compliance is, effective. read technology place years management thought people would Fuck around day.

The virus forced use it. Within 1 week, global basis, company went virtual.

I’m like, apart white boarding so, department (IT) position (Cloud engineer) need in-office?

Like, I’m available home make drive work, responsive I’m usually something house related hyper sensitive work requests it’s project time get done less time aren’t 4 departments asking password doesn’t work changed instead going help desk like should. Honestly, I'm one hate working home, realized probably time retire. like idea company turning pretty nice office culture saw everyone wanted see face face day want, rent-a-cubicle silo lets on-site one day week, even guaranteed know else office day. little desire ever work office it’s proven get amount work done likely also cheaper everyone. gotta copy dolly parton cold shoulder long sleeve started first office job last week working home driving little crazy. feel like I'm able focus working home. Circle circle, dot dot. 

Now got covids shot. 

\**sips beer* me. worked home week last March. week begging come guy rebooted remote worker's PCs lab boy. another week, that's exactly doing, drinking espresso comfy desk without wife dogs TV randomness distracting me.

Totally get side coin though. since moved bit work, realize pandemic ends traffic commute going worse worse. nice option work home that's convenient without beg pretty please. honest, rather go back office work laptop constantly monitored working remote. could care less protecting anti-vax 65. everyone access month two, open fully. point whoever hasn’t taken vaccine choice take risk, don’t care. Practical political considerations also mix here. seeing common sentiment people took virus seriously supported restrictions wholeheartedly get go: everyone chance fully vaccinated absolutely done restrictions. people choose vaccinate? That’s aren’t stopping lives them. Governor tries continue restrictions June/July going rude awakening. Jesk seems like heavy projection preconceived ideas. Sure, parents messed parents. Maybe even majority, knows. 

The thing is, even GOOD parents want kids still probably want homeschool kids middle workday, reason expect would need to. That's unreasonable, justification kids.  absurd statement We've trying convice dad retire 10 years now. say thanks covid retiring year.  started new job front end web dev December 2019. Fast forward last week March 2020.

Fellow front end dev situation. president confirmed post pandemic, we're happy working remote, full time like!  That’s always option hasn’t yielded scary reality mention. DON’T REMEMBER MASKIN’ GOD DAMN THING Boston commuter here, $100/month sounds *beautiful.* current US caseload 60,000 day matches heights southern surge last summer, people normalized it. mind future days workers show office work home. think perfect balance able home family, days go office well. I'm pretty sure depends actually shut down. Closing service industries actually harm overall productivity all, means money stops moving around much. Closing factories incredibly costly, they're one thing that's guaranteed cause spread. sizeable fraction wealthy countries work home productivity would actually rise, businesses forced allowing it. also happens get people years experience wanting move another position slight increase get raise year year plus bonus load 20 grand year jobs people job 10 years 28-30 grand. middle swells upper 40 grand plus jobs become revolving door people hop one company every 18 months. expertise lower stagnates. I'd say that's fair rebuttal, personally feel productive work know I'm working with, work style like, etc. lot knowledge comes camaraderie work place lot harder build remotely. personally sure would even want 100% back work place definitely want least hybrid system pick days go start actually get know people spend lot waking hours with.  found current job (wfh) thru RH.

Worked me! Direct hire, worked interview schedule well, good work home, let them. Less rush hour traffic rest us. I'm glad there's hope find balance. saying *years* modern workforce stark raving bonkers think normal. age technology, white collar workers fight traffic show sit desk another city work 5 days week? roads full, public transport crowded, planet polluted, danger cost abundant world needs break. Plus bonus hiring managers take pick global workforce live nice, cheap rural, scenic locations better suited raising kids businesses save hundreds thousands rent/leases. win-win-win. Depends profession. Software development (which lot people want full time remote are, assume)? Absolutely plenty opportunities people want move full time remote. Almost every message get LinkedIn advertises full time remote, recruiters know people industry want easy way get leg employers stubborn allow it. targeting FAANG big Silicon Valley company might difficult, average programmer picky work can't imagine difficult. difficult old norm choices limited places willing move to. oof. Really hoping start seeing effects vaccinating people soon mother washes groceries, too. extent won’t buy anything shop order takeout drive thru. She’s also three weeks fully vaccinated. won’t vaccinating children 12 time next school year starts. Whether think it’s reasonable not, that’s students’ families told wait return person. asking families make decision virtual vs person next year spring adequately plan. might shift some, don’t think shift half small amount next month so.

The thing consider concerned taxpayer standpoint funding long term. think you’re assuming don’t offer virtual option, families get line attend person. might others leave. Let’s say 40% families say want virtual (which seems fair given current numbers). Let’s say school says tough luck, that’s option. Even half reluctantly come half leaves private, charter, home school, would mean loss 20% per-pupil funding. would devastate programs across district. We’d end cutting things like languages arts. would hurt everyone. better using relief funding federal government create dedicated virtual program next year going back full normal that. working home team decided let go office continue working home. rented small office space costs $600/mo. come go please. Nobody else taken office space. $600 v $15,000. 

In terms productivity, tell nobody working 9-5. Everyone works need long need to. Nobody keeping tabs hours. Everyone happy. Everyone getting shit done. Oh shut up. Democrats! Vax daddy California closed outdoor patios, COVID cases rose people switched drinking indoors. forced back office week. Minimum 2 days week office per HR. Every coworker complained can’t find reasonable childcare, get less done office, could work extra hour day commute, etc.. would say that's necessarily always true, I'm middle manager hate unproductive. matter fact wife trying something right quit job way future solely relying productivity assume that’s worse go little I'd honestly recommend courses programming, development, etc. Since I'm quality assurance end things, I've gotten away self taught well learning job, think viable career path everyone. said, career I've enjoyed. companies decided ""fuck training people"" long started jumping.

Here's clue, company. train somebody, need pay get raise leaving. Great masks cover 95 let 5 out. Ill fitting lower quality ones let far through. 

I'd bet many wearing gaiter type masks well l, actually shown worse wearing mask material mesh aerosolize breath more. course another study showed could semi-effective. I'm exact same. honestly hate working home. I'd better split mentioned. 

As someone ADHD, important seperate home work. pandemic absolute nightmare me. Can't wait see people person again. 34%? like 94%! ain’t going back.

I don’t want hear lies weekend.

I don’t care soccer little league bs. Don’t care deck. work, get paid, stuff. Yeah I'm sure they're arguing right now. costs $2,500+ shitty 500 sq/ft studio Boston, that's clearly me. Meanwhile, costs $1,300 750 sq/ft Providence, yet I'm anticipating pay $400/month commuter rail boston + $120/month parking. point I'm trying make shit's fucked matter slice it, like choice right now. though? wish everyone wanted wfh they'd open it. want go office ever. job pays lot money Experts always immediately right best have. take time speaking subjects, unlike laymen like us. shit!

Potentially population work 9 - 5 commute ends social interaction could less reliant work. They’re one pushing zoom happy hours talent shows. York actually state significant decline cases past 14 days, according Johns Hopkins data.

I noticed earlier week hope trend continues. First shot bb. feel immunity washing (in weeks.) become god you!!!

Nah get ya shot tho, super easy cvs So, going back office? Seems like brainer Interesting. guess issue enough study information know exact reasoning. could even way stop happening people died specific conditions etc. must continue research could simple fix would allow many lives saved. roommate clocked 12am last night worked till 9am ""couldn't sleep"". slept 3 hours clocked right back in. still working now.

Fucking frustrating since trying unwind beers\zoom call friends job (I work nights restaurant; 12am-3am basically evening) working living room.

Cant wait go back work. He's getting obsessive constantly corner living room typing away. I’m talking Dutch vaccine roll poor even relation eu countries. extra painful consider good logistics planning. 7 days podcast time. Sure, way yet widely used/available. Even data heavy job, speeds pretty lacking current iteration. gives shit?

Don't funeral can't afford it. bury can't afford it. Cremations cheap sometimes expenses come up. deal them.

We need nannystate bullshit, especially comes wallet can't serious? I'd tell mom mind damn business. I’m saving £500 month four hours day working home. Luckily employer mandated full time working home even pandemic behind us. never take another job requires lengthy commute. 

And top get much work done home far less distraction. People put social needs coworkers. 

They’re fuckers pushing virtual happy hours talent shows. 

Fuck people. several vaccinated friends still disinfecting

Are Mommy? Holy shit sounds like her. hell “Wink News” ???  think risk still low enough children, think die COVID. like flu them. Hamburger too! Please relax much. Chile done everyone 53 (most still one dose). believe 70 2 doses already, indeed hospitalizations gone down. HOWEVER. facing increasing amount deaths hospitalizations among young people, younger 50. full lockdown. Hey all, (30/m) got J&amp;J vaccine yesterday 10:30am wanted share experience everyone...

I minimal side effects. Around 8-10hr mark shot, muscles got kinda sore, specifically legs felt like spent day hiking. took Advil around 1030pm, helped went sleep. woke 3:30am minor back aches. Took Advil fought way back falling asleep couple hrs. didn’t get good sleep score Fitbit, honestly, I’ll take day given horror stories I’ve read people’s experiences. Anyway, think it’s complete crap shoot. Don’t think you’re overweight fit won’t side effects. It’s total roll dice. Good luck! common cold, don’t know lot not. could it, many possible factors Borders never 100% closed though they? irrelevant point. virus somewhere, passed within country . . .

I understand mean restrictions continue indefinitely. saying comes end vaccine rolled out. countries suppressing virus still vaccinating people, well everything else. better limits possibility transmission limits possibility mutations variants.

The countries gone route opening back safely (or entirely locked all), economies hit hard have, jobs livelihoods wiped extent have.

It's no-brainer. 

But sure, strategy much better. called ""keep fingers crossed vaccines workout, thousand people die process way is""

Totally rational. think Newsom lift mask mandate (and when) CDC says so. fact, see lot left-wing states that.

Depends left-wing state.

Maryland, Massachusetts, Vermont three states would generally consider left-wing. Republican governors. three, expect state-wides removed localities DC suburbs MD, Boston, whatever big city exists Vermont keep them. I’ve fully vaccinated 6 months trust covid still going effect life going forward. least fall hopefully reach heard immunity. Would ""60%"" hard say? hell says ""three five""? Canadian friend traveling US funeral, air. get tested United States order return home Canada? can't find information anywhere testing foreign citizens - fact many websites say ""testing supplies limited"" still, reads like give tests anyone. aware bars minority right? one making mandatory...so bar half time check ID anyway ones deciding they're it.


Do yoy really see bouncers front bar checking vaccine passports? mandatory, people go many establishments require them.

I think realistic view going go. Sure, go: House press secretary Jen Psaki Tuesday ruled Biden administration playing role ""vaccine passport"" system Republican governors particular balk concept.

""The government now, supporting system requires Americans carry credential. federal vaccinations database federal mandate requiring everyone obtain single vaccination credential,"" Psaki told reporters briefing.

The White House clear would defer private companies wanted implement type vaccine passport system individuals would provide proof received one coronavirus shots.” Nothing happened? made poor decisions matter people made good ones?

Hey, drove highway 120 day. People told safe. people now? all, nothing happened. No, vaccine passports less restrictions restrictions.  


If want vaccines vaccines, restrictions 100% pointless, vaccine passports. recommended take Tylenol Ibuprofen sure  scott atlas, radiologist, nothing infectious diseases. Meaning july 4th latest, earliest, project july 4th? looks like 65+ demographic also heading least 80% vaccination hopefully good signs vaccine uptake greater population think it’s supposed stop spread virus? even get kids' bloodstream, antibodies would stay gut. 

""In humans, gut closure occurs precociously, breast milk antibodies enter neonatal/infant circulation. imagine, call parents observe. agree more. situation EU good, many countries far worse. AZ vaccines shared. [Nice Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced launch Excelsior Pass — **a free, voluntary platform** developed partnership IBM, utilizes proven, secure technology confirm individual's recent negative PCR antigen test result proof vaccination help fast-track reopening businesses event venues accordance New York State Department Health guidelines. part initial launch, participating New Yorkers **may choose use** Excelsior Pass verify COVID-19 vaccination negative test results **as needed** gain entry major stadiums arenas, wedding receptions, catered events social gathering limit. 

The businesses may require them, yes, program participation voluntary. Mavs games require vaccines  absolutely right, Illinois exact thing.

Nah, Illinois statewide would lift it, Lightfoot Chicago fight back that, governor fights her.

Those two going back forth entire pandemic. ever happened, instead half country like ""nah"" Strictness measures generally aligns states' voting preferences. Vermont's lean state strongly towards side generally aligns stricter measures. state willing put hard date end masking mandates, portends well trend states less inclined towards restrictive measures would same.

Both comment meant agnostic sort value judgments towards respective states political leanings. Nah type people want destroy us. Yes, effect vaccine whatsoever. would lessoning restrictions overall, opposite

the goal reasonable public safety.  Apparently chronic shut ins. greatly reduces chances following,

1. Getting infected level thus able spread virus.

2. Getting mild infection symptoms.

3. Getting severe infection. 

4. hospitalized.

5. Dying. 

Basically vaccine reduces chances negative associated covid. whats even point question Yes individuals absolutely dangerous. tried kill speaker.

Okay evidently talking two different people. can't wait data drop, gonna exciting read through. Get one get soonest - safe effective. Sorry, source that? I've heard implementing nationwide domestic thing. I'm confused about... mean I'll probs... really hoping lasting vaccine 'a every years' even less dose, yearly... 219.2 Doses Distributed

41.7% Adults Least One Dose

24.4% Adults Fully Vaccinated  Pfizer Moderna vaccines:

-94-95% effective even getting Covid (meaning, 94%+ less likely get Covid vaccinated someone isn’t)

-100% effective severe Covid (eg requiring hospitalization) death

-Data coming verifying won’t spread Covid others vaccinated - good around well

There’s absolutely reason get vaccinated. They’re here, they’re safe, work incredibly well. White Republicans hesitant group. Maybe demographic Georgia? remember people bitching Texas? happened that?

And say manipulating numbers, CDC's numbers projections tracked independent universities labs using different metrics data. unless Texas actually paying entities make numbers look better, think pretty unrealistic claim. Well, no, obscure everyone states one thing. Masks where? Indoors times? eating? socially distanced? Speaking of, restaurants still socially distance? distance inside, distance outside?

It's vague term obscure everyone. mean he’s getting downvoted absurd opinion. 

104M people least one dose. 330m people country, 75m google appear 18. 

104/(330-75) 40% already states real population large portions population cant get yet, opened week. source that? know shipments q2 much higher (x3 so), hear anything lifting export restrictions. brand?  masks gonna stay lot people, regardless state says mean given first part said, think thats reason enough whole thought nonsensical ""And rest dead"" I'll probably keep wearing mine mass transit cold flu season.

But think we'll mask mandates anywhere outside *maybe* hospitals year now. ""we"" don't.

Anyone simple pattern recognition see happening.

If first wave bad, trying third wave now, michigan one really one such, hospitalizations various areas, cases rising weeks. 

These increases helped transmissible variants, greatly hamstrung vaccinations, mean patient populations younger. areas like Northeast, transmission slightly winning out, surely long. 

You see numbers put context. context isnt ""what worry"" ""the sky falling.""

Too many people making bad choices, always did, showing short term thinking always did. we're bailed massive amount money, priveleged position, excellent science, remarkable vaccine roll out. And?

She's Republican, means California dead-in-the-water. Okay... never answer question earlier guess did:

You think 10+ years need show door McDonalds right vaccines order eat without mask? 

I see reason thing would made permanent aside Pandemics happening left right. Yes, making illegal businesses ask proof vaccination. 

Yes individuals absolutely dangerous. tried kill speaker. live virus assays using Moderna’s vaccine well it’s roughly equivalent Pfizer. really depends study you’re looking it’s close. 

Both vaccines extremely similar design. Pretty much difference two concentration mRNA per dose doesn’t much vaccine efficacy. DeSantis Republican. Reddit would shit even discovered cure cancer. /r/coronavirusmichigan detail They’ve already said no. 100% safe take ibuprofen days getting first dose vaccine? Well that’s gotta throw wrench conspiracy theories. going pretend expert basic napkin math google appears 42% yesterday. Okay, I'm up-to-date goings-on Vermont. exactly ""Vermont places"" mean here? someone explain importance vaccine is? keep dying covid? want info decide get vaccine. know you’re getting downvoted honest, think you’re right. always suspected push came shove, everyone wouldn’t right thing...but truly eye-opening experience. entire family feel exact way do. We’re deeply, deeply disappointed many people lives behaved throughout this. fundamental problem company living government contracts. like since compete market, fix problem paying lobbyists. Same. assumed meant Moderna vs Pfizer. Honestly encouraging number. They've averaging 6,500 cases reported 6,000 last Tuesday. Hopefully they're back downswing now. they're attempting troll, give air. not. Vaccines already required things like attend public schools universities, travel certain places, etc. 

Also, HIPAA forbid individuals entities asking divulge medical status, prevents third parties divulging without permission. medical procedure forced agree order obtain driver's license, again?

Eye test? Certainly true UK. fell mind forgot scrolled so... thanks explanation guess  percentage.  reality staying trickle coming out, hence even ""first world countries"" europe, canada, etc 2nd/3rd line.

Now need imagine 3rd world countries. 

My country 180k doses astrazeneca india covax initiative late february. Since then, 760k Sinovac early march 1 million sinovac late march.


&amp;nbsp;

Astra, Pfizer, Moderna (and guess J&amp;J now) distributed mostly (percentage-wise) towards 3 5 countries. small trickle released first world countries. even smaller trickle towards everyone else.

We deals place deliver Astra shots late february March (8 million) got covax initiative shots. pfizer shots also due start april far there's word we're getting. reason simply hogged some. going vaccinations Georgia? painfully behind states  Link statement? Leftist, online people seem pessimistic pandemic. vaccine, vehemently disagree vaccine passports. Yes.

[The New York government support one vaccine passport tested New York rolled “Excelsior Pass,” billed state “a free, fast secure way present digital proof Covid-19 vaccination” case reopening sports entertainment venues require proof attendees’ status.

Walmart hopping trend, see link Walmart, nation’s largest private employer, offering electronic verification apps patients vaccinated stores “can easily access vaccine status needed,” company says.

[There's rumors Biden administration working guidelines states could implement Biden administration private companies working develop standard way handling credentials — often referred “vaccine passports” — would allow Americans prove vaccinated novel coronavirus businesses try reopen.

I bitching something rolled **yet** clearly coming. bitching something almost certain stick around post-pandemic ""we need feel safe"", kind like over-the-top airport-security measures now. gave birth October tested negative beforehand wear mask times except started actually pushing. hope things better hopefully medical staff vaccinated too! vaccine requirements removed.

I really fucking hope actually happen we're going like 5 pandemics different diseases happening once. also got killed young people disabled others. I’m taking chances. Join us, tea, crumpets, shite weather Haha, it’s Texas, don’t require anything AZ might link side effects, possibly, rare clotting events. Meanwhile Brazil, 4000 people die Covid today. really wartime head here. long want wait?

Well, states rising cases, open up, right? Retroviruses different beast coronaviruses. may claim anti-vax really curious able look differences own. point inconsistent. OK require vaccines one disease another disease?


The difference, least according executive order federal statute/FDA guidelines, COVID-19 vaccine approved emergency use FDA, per federal statutes, individuals right refuse products emergency use authorization. 


So difference vaccines like polio emergency authorization federal statues surrounding emergency authorization. 


Link full order: think feds implement vaccine passports international travel? not?

That's something *should* do. Hey necessarily disagree. also think timeline long personally. relating stance matter mostly. get approach, also think lot stockholm syndrome right world shifted far one way risk/reward tolerance spectrum. 

At end day much much sucks, deal whatever hand government deals us pray see reason put behind us come summer.

I girlfriend foreign country wont seen 12 months time able fly avoid quarantine, trust want shit finished (all restrictions) soon possible. Even numbers seem like it, everyone know wanted vaccine able find one matter days extra doses.

Vaccine rollout awesome LA. Lol prepandemic world im pretty sure would apply  I’m big tech. I’m fortunate shuttles work commute. I’ll also 1-2 days home peak hours office I’m in, days (9-4 base, 8-5 shuttle, 30-45 min dinner, needed). couldn’t work commute, I’d applying internal external roles fully remote remote. actions took last pandemics? I'm sure it'll end well 😇😷👨‍👨‍👦👩‍👩‍👧

As long keep well away family! yeah lol definitely friends like shitting anything problem states brought back, still capacity restrictions. restaurant employees supposed reasonably search work industry allows 50% occupancy? Sweden average Europe afaik. horrible, great. Though look entire world, pretty damn bad Getting second shot next week second day Ramadan. feel well I'll break fast make later. big issue... Yet another great question! refer case detection rate (CDR, although strictly speaking could called infection detection rate since many asymptomatic). CDR changes time, based much spread much testing is, well testing targeted. CDR ranged 10% (9 10 infections diagnosed) third maybe half. Fundamentally, crush curve, need get CDR way up, finding cases, find fast, isolate them, quarantine contacts. didn’t go well first time around need ready relaunch it. released information [yesterday look like.

There ways estimate number estimates indirect. back-calculated deaths, accounting lag cases. serological test, still lot unknowns sensitivity specificity different serological excellent estimates this, [Oliver some. Rough guess, maybe 1/3 infections currently diagnosed, that’s really guess point, different different parts country different times. Funny thing is, too. thrive office want freedom stay home don’t much “high interaction” stuff do. would want something offer employees? ""Probably""

No, man, probable outcome.  initially schools opening august, gather, high school middle school kids transmitting covid regardless sitting school not. overwhelming amount students gather outside school, either socially, sports, activities. Transmission covid school day high (relatively) .

One argument heard like is, kids school actually enforce stay socially distanced wear mask. Different people work differently. people learn differently - people visual, people hands-on, people learn best books, etc.

I hope comes time return ""normal"", workplace acknowledges that.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Except for, know, figuring much vaccinated people spread virus. I’m saying forever, everyone vaccinated been, need monitor transmission. started new job right covid hit ended doing. meet new person try set 30 minutes talk roles go script hobbies, live, what's experience, etc. casually meeting someone break room, I'll put build relationships.  people reserved, become immediate friends. Seriously. building codes related earthquakes, surprised building codes could put place terms ventilation Infectious disease protection. (If already) Idk man. blatantly obvious outdoor transmission big factor. Germany, top level football (what us ppl call soccer...) allowed happening, without audience.

Every then, player found covid positive quarantined.
However, aware got infection another player field. reported player tested positive one day game players opposing team got infected.

But kids still allowed even training, far less intense. get tested twice per week covid, almost professionals.
My daughter can't even go horse riding lessons, can't even keep distance humans there. Horses big outdoors.

So many regulations restrictions make sense all. idiotic. businesses routinely suffer high turnover unhappy workers almost always considered costs concluded worth paying get benefits.

As concrete example, Amazon pretty shrewd company. ""secure hardest working, loyal staff"" ""high turnover, unhappy workers"" thing, depending kind work they're staffing. bureaucracy one reasons EMA charge vaccinations, it’s charge authorizations, vaccinations depend national authorities. 
« Use vaccine vaccination campaigns national level also take account pandemic situation vaccine availability individual Member State. »
In Nordic countries 40 died Covid, sill wise expose risk could greater Covid less risky alternatives ? 
That’s reason Nordic countries stopped AZ rollout weeks ago, replaced mRNA. incidence rare blood clots among recipients three vaccines approved EMA within would expected general population. figures given press conference were:

* Johnson&amp;Johnson: 3 4.5 million 
* BioNTech-Pfizer: 35 54 million 
* Moderna: 5 4 million Exactly! think middle ground right here. Variants DEFINITELY fundamental risk control. driving spiraling spread world, including Michigan. DEFINITELY know whether vaccine-escape mutants require us tweak vaccines. responsible thing tamp uncontrolled spread wherever spreads, vaccinate rapidly equitably possible, study variants evolve. new virus, cannot predict certainty act. HOPE evolve evade vaccine-induced immunity, hope plan, many lives stake assume happen. talking Discord Zoom really can't replace person meetings. business leisure.

Could provide specific examples? Mostly business example, leisure quite obvious. got mine hour ago, feels like pinched hell arm. I'm waiting side effects hit me, pretty mild covid I'm curious compare. hybrid model best. someone needs office space thrive, power them. someone get showing quarterly meetings, fuck ya well. Yikes. see difficult you.   Weird response told missing point. adult response would've something like ""oops, right, missed that."" considering several options cancer treatment. considering far vaccination concerned. later. I'm going exactly job let stay full time remote 'most restrictions' frankly good enough. would need restrictions point? fact need vulnerable groups vaccinated? I'm 31 year old who's COVID mild cough loss smell week two, majority unvaccinated people right mild symptoms too.

'Long COVID' expect peoples response be, given many people COVID UK long term complications seem extremely rare. “17·39% (17·04–17·74) anxiety disorder”

Hmm. covid media public health officials telling everyone they’re going die?

Anxiety incredibly common covid. really blame covid anxiety?

CNN went far call symptoms “brain niece asked told make routine appearances office. think truth say, unfortunately.

But depends work. I’m fortunate work product employees easy see easy judge. don’t personally worry lazy people anything getting sense workers contributions.

Still, career-minded people plan showing routinely (2-3 days per week) insurance policy in-person bias. country already got bash first second wave. US prominent, probably reason why. Yeah, I’m starting new job summer, gave option completely remotely coming 3 days week. took latter, even though it’s long commute — it’s nice regular schedule place go people see (as much I’ve enjoyed working home.) hard Evangelicals demonize government academia suddenly turn around say good things. easier double down. 

Crazy conspiracies part parcel Evangelical Christianity. live really small apartment work area living room able rearrange book case tv stand order create wall couch desk. It’s made working home much better feels like it’s little office don’t look work stuff outside work hours Friends life reason, season lifetime.


Just stay touch forever mean genuine connection lasted. That's friendships go. Gotta make effort form new ones maintain ones want last. hate right absolutely reason test asymptomatic vaccinated people. It’s waste resources. Testing requires lots money resources, could better spent towards vaccination efforts improvements medical system. 

This virtually every expert saying right ***full time*** think key operative word here. keep joking friends everyone goes back, I'm never it. Thankfully, employer allowing remote long haul even though position going back office next month (I moved 500 miles offices choice).

I really see ever wanting go back. I'm much happier home find I'm much productive finish work day, I'm done incentive working deadlines half days 4/5 days week I'm locked in. 

Like people said thread, almost getting raise decreased gas cost, spending money lunch office (I always sucked packing $6-$7 day really adds up). Again...this already tried before. see reason would work better time. thoughts prayers versus science. science wins, religion diminished church profits suffer. So, business model pastor multi-million, tax-fee, mega-church industry, best bet trash science. (And, also get vaccinated want screw getting Covid-19. keep yourself.) That's crazy. I'm Ireland strictest lockdown developed country world opening June, universities still planning least 50% classes person probably increase make progress vaccinations. log phone I’m still bed wander downstairs work like hour later. I’ve always “go library” type person. year shown rely heavily getting work done different place live. feel happier, like fully realized person, much productive quiet office environment. I’m young person whose job done entirely remote — brain seems work. Even restrict working hours 9-5 home, home office feels like rotten pit work can’t stand look at. want home. can’t wait work building I’m fully vaccinated. 

That said, teammates don’t seem issue. wouldn’t personally expect come don’t need to. Although would get tiresome become in-person errand boy. I’ll restart computers don’t make build whole lab PC set prefer stay home. Working home mean work home. need wifi connection mobile hotspot. WFH days, probably spend half dog park writing reports tossing ball dog. senseless Janssen vaccine serious side effects AZ stop using one well. delay vaccination program further, get enough doses Pfizer Moderna order vaccinate everyone fall. Hopefully issue AZ though. said otherwise healthy young people. people age 75, multiple chronic health conditions like hypertension diabetes, covid much higher rates death complications. That’s read it. think it’s “you don’t get tested” “don’t get tested”. There’s shortage tests anymore; surveillance testing definitely helps us keep eye asymptomatic spread.  Yeah people complaining wanting force everyone office make friends annoy us 'full remote' camp.


I life, job. everyone return office get lonely. Go make damn friends... drive half office go anyway!!!

Why she/he drive themselves? pay Americans Indians Filipinos less know childish find hilarious man's name Professor Weed. universal. I've walked dog twice day Austin without mask (while maintaining distance) every single day pandemic one's even given look. fascinating puritanism made parts country left others untouched. love working home it’d nice go office twice week. live alone need social interaction lol Don’t know, really don’t know remove posts regarding vaccine count. posts probably reason come subreddit

Plus, I’ve never seen remove posts regarding case count. really can’t tell criteria us 20 minute commute car live alone, thus much productive stuck house day.

Obviously everybody different situation, prefer office every time. Yeah hope companies went remote least keep hybrid system after. We’re pretty much remote forever now, flexible office days things go back normal. Stay safe!  yes can't watch shoulder child, home work! tell you’re delusional american without telling  Moderna. 1st dose, arm pain. 2nd dose, beginning 12 hours getting mild flu-like symptoms. 12 hours completely fine. would rate vaccinated 10/10. Definitely better risking 'rona. dozens examples science followed year.  Depends bad get guess. Yes do. first confirmed case january 26, 2020. patient hospitalized. first patient hospitalized coronavirus March 6th, 2020. OP's son hospitalized confirmed covid case january 15th 2020. literally impossible. OPs son unlikely ever positive test covid-19. possible anti-body test time Summer could confirmed suspicion - course case OP's son could covid point editor never need work office. work solitary communication electronic anyway. 

In Times, think senior management thought anyone wanted work home playing day. Now, they’ve seen still productive ever, moreso areas organization. 

So they’re talking closing office consolidating main office, giving us work space main requiring us actually work in-office. 

Because efficient productive, get save money hand fist. it’s rent office overhead. way, organization gets foist costs wifi, phones, office supplies, etc worker. They’ve clear won’t paying part electric bills working home. think it’s optional point. go (and laptop busted need print something) hardly anyone does. 

So organization seriously considering, maybe planning already, make telework permanent us. it’s damn time. view silver lining pestilence. others too, like I’m getting like two months tank gas. one house much sniffle year. I’m wearing mask cold flu season on. essential worker, would kill able work house interact real humans extended period time. hope means finally see harmonized approach EU countries regarding AZ. wildly different age restrictions member states served damage confidence vaccine. CDC says you’re vaccinated get tested unless experiencing symptoms.

My workplace stopped routine testing vaccinated. CDC protocol, maybe business security theatre waste money resources constantly text asymptomatic vaccinated people. Sounds like asshole manager. Even though understand wants house. isn’t problem makes suffer convenience. Yes, recovered “No new normal” aka “I evolutionary dead-end” I’m childcare worker 2nd dose last week! It’s relief work closely multiple families. thing taking account ""working home"" right literally home whole time. Normally dad working home he'd go library half day come home, staying home time wearing think every community, basics same.

First, listen! people thinking saying? concerns?

Second, acknowledge! real concerns, maybe lack information, something heard.

Third, speak simply. Give clear, honest, accurate information.

Fourth, tell stories. Narratives virus done harm people economies, vaccine get us new normal.

Key connect people, share personal experience stories try find common ground. right messages matter. Every community needs deserves this. Urban rural. race/ethnic groups. political affiliations. Lol even notice You’re lazier ;) workplace indicated offer it. feel like main driver behind though literally broke ground new building sold old one 2-3 mos covid hit. really cancel construction project they'd spent much time on. We'll remote end year (new building done 'til then) knows. people survey employees favor hybrid schedule office 2-3 days week. Something like 10-15% favored back office 5x week like they're minority. suspect people hate wives/kids/dogs go work get away them. concern mostly concessions, food lines, bathrooms, security lines, walking seats seating itself. I've watching games, make use is.... great! Reddit algorithm terrible debate, tends reinforce group think.  

Or even group think, actually enable subversion replacement apparent consensus early downvotes coordinated all.  we've got popular forum allows motivated people promote opinions suppress everyone elses. Appreciate it. put hard work, skipping lunches working past punch time. also Hired 3 new people gave amazing WFH job. right feel amazing retrospect, feeling helping others Well, that's one way thin herd, simultaneously making worse everybody. I'm glad guy got vaccine, SMDH, kids say. Alittle nervous getting vaccine Saturday, anyone encouraging thoughts? It’s kind gratifying someone like see comment like yours. soon learned highly contagious, AIRBORNE virus, seemed obvious lockdowns wouldn’t work. Masks, yes. Absolutely. avoiding air seems like fool’s errand me. virus spread touching surfaces something like that, lockdowns chance. outside masks living island country government total control border, nothing stop spread. feel career competiviteness situation? rarely see talked can't believe managers likely promote people coming office vs home. feel nature like people see everyday. managers going prefer ""butts seats"" approach too. 


That means people drawn office move anyway we're kinda back square one. draw line somewhere. way 50s recommended flu jab 49.

I'm sorry, that's same. Right folks I'm listening seriously Scott Gottlieb one lovely furry Twitter pine marten character, they're ones focusing real-world impacts.

Mac n' Chise basically anti-Ding. world Twitter follower counts would swapped. We're still much pandemic, consequences infection. Right-wing media encourages scoffing reality, we're best getting risk low possible prior lifting restrictions. Baby steps that. ""New Bering Strait variant everything.

Scientists discovered new variant floating Bering Strait (BS) today threatens extend pandemic *four billion years.* Dow breaking news.

The scientists claim new BS variant deadly, also likely spread instantaneously person person, regardless distance relative location globe. BS variant causes tickling sensation lead pregnancy. Though viral loads lower, symptoms severe. BS variant evade one mask, two three, *will infect* make sure nostrils exposed wearing mask.

The BS variant neutralized sera recovered individuals vaccinated. three foreign bank accounts American passport. currently investigation money laundering fraud. identify BS variant oversized tie awkward forward lean. see BS variant, may late, get tested four days exposure. unclear whether current testing protocol sufficient detect new deadly variant. "" feel pros cons working remotely. like don’t fill gas tank quite much (although negated signed Instacart pre-COVID side gig went away). It’s much easier cook dinner keep eye it, squeeze chores.

That said, would welcome least going office couple days week again. enjoy coworkers pandemic. “we’re best friends” way, liked collaborating making small talk, company positive work culture. don’t think there’s anything wrong liking things. doesn’t mean I’m devoted job friends. 

Plus live one-bedroom apartment lot activities generally still restricted. feel like can’t recharge much could 100% open economy. Hard feel really rested like escape work apartment, live limited options outside work socialization steeped COVID policies anyway. pandemic used like baseball games, I’m going one wear mask seat even gets warmer. Norway, 1 25k. Chicago said open April also April 19. people need gather society function properly. 

Apparently not! least, period time needed lockdowns attend day jobs

only essential workers going correctly pesky humans

like much East Asia. read article? vax goes EU countries divided population. think said bottled Germany, 15% go back France share.

This positive step. Produce already successful vaccines opposed trying get approved. think another company France manufacturing Moderna. fact people shown interest goal getting covid regardless health stats fucking mind boggling.

Absolutely, this. amount people heard say things like ""I'm worried even get it, immune system great"" infuriating. 9 10 times, someone healthy saying somehow complex stronger immune potential issues anyone else. literally matter healthy are, run risk complications matter what. Lots people even use reasoning bother vaccine. Blows god damn mind. Norway expecting 680.000 J&amp;J June, hopefully happen! Life goes on, except people entertainment/personal services apparently. logistics.

Can stop pretending also issue Germany? They’re probably going something dumb like allow 78 year olds make appointments 79 year olds vaccinated. friends job reminded every day nice December 6 January 28 specifically. response winter surge ICU capacity dangerously low. Yeah said briefing look cases per number vaccines given incidence rate clots (or close to) men women. Burning fossil fuel gas nothing, too. months??? I'll looking join events like weeks, vaccine reaches full strength. safer would also include land habitability. still need use nuclear narrowing safety scope direct deaths unrealistic measurement. everybody clapped. (Upvoted) 

This proves Reddit full bunch agoraphobic recluses. make decision April 15th time people age group already vaccinated makes sense simply give away vaccines stocked countries still wants use AZ vaccine.  19 deaths 71 cases. 7 deaths 30 cases last week? something like 7 total cars one before.. shows really looking it. According data, risk COVID still much higher risk vaccine current levels infection UK.

Additional, Professor Sir Munir confirmed per dose UK, increase side effects women (because women vaccinated). That’s fam 😂 news, 100% remote workers say that. know how? Lol went 'no mass violent protests ALL' 'uhhh kinds people! Abort mission.' returned work week confirm. long billionaires complete bullshit. Check graphs tweets above, risks serious reactions vaccine increase younger are. 79 cases UK, still rather small sample serious backup this? see quantified data regarding mutation rate? much genetic tracing doing. important tracking evolving genealogy Stuff like makes wonder even got vaccinated.

Oh no, wait months everything fully reopened. Might well gotten vaccinated. Meanwhile millions people can't even get appointment yet.

What selfish shortsighted perspective. get trouble - vaccine provider might. I'd go it. restrictions states US despite zero cases

At least wear mask guess Entertainment/personal services shut down, otherwise everything else pretty much business normal (and booming certain sectors). Furlough schemes used help worst affected. Life goes on! Let everyone choice. single people get short end stick don’t “excuse” like children home? We’re already treated like second class citizens. time valuable anyone else’s time. questions hear people asking think wrong questions ask? Probably it’s politically toxic even science supports can. Hey fuck people sleeping long? time sleep 8-9 hours per night basically wake right 6 hours so. Yeah, need office perks happy hours work, plus freedom working remotely. time alive. ;) find helps room dedicated work (if possible) work life associations spill rest home.

Also living significant helps daily social interaction. think I'd gone crazy otherwise. would love much. company let us weeks last year since we've office full time. wife serious health issues much easier I'm home help throughout day. Even part time home would great. Maybe department grows bit work schedule, I'm holding breath. absence scientific consensus something risk, responsibility government agencies even media provide guidance abundance caution.

 Meanwhile seems counter narrative stemming certain types pandemic-fatigued centrists spreading non-scientific idea vaccinated like superpower enables whatever want. without infrastructure it. every employee realising work home boss realising outsource. I’m closer fellow employees before. set 1-on-1s make sure talk personal stuff, hard office cubicle farm, everyone hear conversation. There's certainly truth that, really find 40 hours work per week hour's commute particularly limiting terms time spent stuff, especially weekends free. Work convenient way get steady stream social interaction. easier get ideas things do, e.g. clubs whatever projects could spend time on. kinda bs. covid deaths get paid others? cover costs pocket past. Where’s reimbursement? plenty people died last year things covid, yet remain invisible (as people left behind)... aren’t losses considered part covid? 

I tell first hand losing someone last year uniquely difficult... covid impacted ability visit loved ones hospital, say goodbye, physically present support remaining family members, etc. actual cause death didn’t make easier didn’t happen covid. lost friend 20 years... someone known half life... unexpected illness unable say goodbye. Don’t tell wasn’t covid loss. 

Her family barely scraped cremation, didn’t life insurance. Zoom funeral service blessing ways, yet months later still stuck trying move experience. isn’t first rodeo, absolutely different directly impacted pandemic. 

I feel like much better ways support recovery without privileging select group ignoring needs others. like going work gets house, work 4 days week. I'm competent give accurate answer. However, personal opinion got many people ""let's wait see"" category, combined ""I want Pfizer"" gang. 

Honestly, former today found good friend mine got bad last night. kinda made put things gear. there's zero freaking time. past year half, lost 100 lbs gone morbidly obese healthy weight. I've done diet alone.  3 kids home 24/7 virtual school time would even moment exercise 10 PM I'm exhausted. Hoping maybe outside weather improves. That’s true, I’m 20 years old get vaccine time like rural area PA. decided get already survived covid it’s worth risk. Vaccine though, starting become readily available. think people resisting jab. Based what?

I mean, already proof CFA well pandemic places: [6 13 outbreaks fast food news older, 4 months pandemic considerably worse. Accounting nearly half outbreaks despite 

But, yes, woman whose mask slipping face can't bothered almost negligible 10 second encounter drive window, yes, still think many right things outside work.

And woman McDonald's taking money? her, right? 7 people crammed together like CFA? mask discipline might snuff, let's pretend CFA workers also engaging obvious risky behavior. 

Masking single facet, ""handling food"" thing completely falls deaf ears. norovirus.   Well, it’s mostly Biontech though. Tja Germany opened another plant Marburg. vaccines comes from
That. Thanks able get many doses out. Specifically case, work state government legally hire people actually live state there's hundreds thousands jobs can't outsourced. EU fucked buying vaccines badly we're still six months away Joe Blow getting shot. Germany *just* started vaccinating 70-80 crowd. Even everyone board vaccinated Covid, ships still floating Petri dishes infectious diseases, always have. Cruise ships common party place students scandinavia want get drunk fuck around couple days 20 euro tickets tax free alcohol. people opposite. I’m home kids day virtual learning. also active 2-YO. 

It’s environment husband get work done quietly.  talking work home, I'm commenting quality internet nature working *home* . Saying reason jobs outsourced employees demand work home looking fact would outsource regardless worth it.... Find people enjoy things do. Hobbies career type expertise. easier large metro area. 

And introvert struggle in-person friend making. easy create friends amongst people enjoy things. problem opening talking. That's address introverted tendencies. actually prefer team WFH. problem level productivities workers went WFH. lot. know causing clot? Somehow feel like can’t compared allergic reaction maybe I’m wrong? Ironically, like office.  Worked offices limited home working decades say probably interaction people moment ever really office sat earphones trying drown waffle, random noise open mouth eaters!

I know couple people team want give home office. hour traveling morning, hour home again.  Early rise, exhausted home, angry queues, never see kids aside dinner bed. They've said they'd rather quit get pay reduction close job come office 5 days week!

I tend get done day, actually get time too! I've felt less ill depressed since home.  downside electric bill fact drive half office go anyway!!! want full time office either, mean like staying home time. perfect employer would one sort hub come meet coworkers whenever wish, also able stay home day week feel like it.

Also sort fixed schedule (e.g. Monday Wednesday there, days remotely) sound attractive either -- flexibility choice that's attractive me. 32% actually it.

I'd rather fishing every day I'm working, eat so... Get first shot now. Throw away vaccine card, get two months list real birthdate vaccine card (and you, perhaps get second shot 16 (in words, would spreading second shot two months (first 16 second 16), would fine). I'm actually surprised low. 12 people family (parents, aunts, uncles) age 65 received SECOND shot end February. excerpts survey published staffing firm Robert Half. involved 1,000 adult employees US companies, currently working home due half surveyed WFH employees (49%) said would prefer hybrid work arrangement, dividing time office another location. Likewise, 26% said want remain fully remote, 25% wanted return full-time office survey also reveals employers help “ease” transition back office example, important aspect surveyed employees mentioned freedom. all, means freedom set office also grown increasingly fond highly-personalized workspace WFH jobs allow for. Along lines, indicated WFH provides distraction-free environment. includes, example, needing make chit-chat WFH survey respondents also said prefer “relaxed” dress code they’ve grown used need come back office, even part-time, employees said expect changes. example, they’d want employer cover commuting costs, also provide form childcare. emailed us parking changes sept go back person, it’s like 250/month pass since it’s city waitlist several thousand people long, I’ll buy train pass train parking pass instead like $150 month, add commute time top things going prevent companies hiring workers outside US

There nothing stopping before. ""Insourcing"" thing now, companies hire talent lower cost areas US. We'll likely see continue expansion remote work Really awkward considering Indian medias bragging quicktly supplying whole world issue still requires live within reasonable distance employer. 

I live area high cost living wages kept hybrid work schedule still requires tied area. company intends hybrid schedule months. 

I'm interviewing fully remote job would $11k base increase plus better comp plan (I'm sales). I'm going take job offered make move cheaper area. I’m charge creating plan returning office. much older people really want work office. want I’m opening hybrid option folks come little twice week. I’m big proponent good mental physical health. work life balance helps promote both. clear long time ago outdoor transmission rare, still people regularly tell mask outdoors. see day. started new job last summer part interact coworkers unless supervisor telling established employees tattled something wrong. Well barely trained things wrong. Help get it. SSI's official weekly vaccination update [on calender page 7 (sorry source says ""The calender update 19th march, calender adjusted ca. 450,000 less doses Johnson &amp; Johnson april"".

So actually unsure, could well saying quarter target divided 3. good grandkid. I’m sorry cloth mask problem there's me: please give job. get half work half quality that's still good deal paying 10% previous employee. wrote headline one would give clicks  WFH problem though. setting boundaries problem. I've seen plenty people dealt long wfh. end workday comes up, 99% days I'm done working want rest night. difference deal hour long commute. want 2 separate things, stop working end day would normally stop working. job let taking advantage that, politely let know off, find another job respect boundaries. 


If helps, go work Starbucks Library leave done. think misguided blame things WFH many people included love arrangement truly never want go back Ew per links:

* NL - several hundred
* DE - 20k Querdenker nutters, fairly big, probably them.
* IE - several hundred. 

No mass protests ordinary people.  Go helpers go said ""good"" ""standard"" treatment yet since complicated disease. think CDCs response pandemic? would improve response lessons learned? 

Were surprised nations lack preparation pandemic? everyone afford take work 2 days flu-like symptoms. Thus reason hope ready. wish would prepared better &amp; stocked easy eat soup &amp; Gatorade. foresight make sure work days shot. easy 48 hours. 

I'm also anti-vaxxer. got fucking injection. Outsourcing even multiple offices nothing new lot jobs (though guess others might first time think it) Yeah cheers, edited comments live house 5 people friends interactions coworkers. said, always enjoy meeting new people talking people coworkers work field already similar interest mostly young well good talk know something completely ignore entirely, small number overall irrational concerned it.

Upon closer infection, would honestly doubt 65 reports confirmed reinfections. article states, one confirmed reinfection (determined vivo) 65 reports (did go reinfection analysis) 13,000 speculated reinfections. confirmed reinfection means variant needs different variant one initially reinfected them. 

If see 65 confirmed reinfections, would concerning implications opinion since number comparative number people went reinfection analysis comes sample - example: 100 suspected people went reinfection analysis find 65. would mean 65% suspected reinfections actual reinfections. Comparing current 133,181,257 cases want generalize data. since none 65 actually confirmed, actually mean much. Friday hit 1k deaths barely. There’s really good VOX video wearing mask running necessary, short obvious answer is: no.

It’s combination 2 things, one outdoor transmission hard wind factors spreads virus around, limiting total exposure begin with.

The second moment contact (being within 6-8 feet) one party jogging, short it’s unlikely even carrier, person would exposed enough virus really matter.

Now there’s argument wearing masks generally limit amount exposure, since getting Covid question much you’ve exposed rather get don’t scenario, running outdoors seems incredibly low-risk endeavor. know allergy one vaccine ingredients, talk doctor getting vaccine.

Otherwise, go it. People often take existence MIS-C proof need vaccinate children ASAP protect COVID, important note issue related children's immune response rather damage infection. Tuesday JAMA Pediatrics, study said “most MIS-C illnesses believed result asymptomatic mild Covid-19” followed hyper-inflammatory response appears occur patients’ bodies produced maximum level antibodies virus.

From [a study MIS-C published diagnosed severe MIS‐C found higher levels antibody response SARS‐CoV‐2 including higher levels receptor‐binding domain, neutralization titers, antibody levels spike protein viral nucleocapsid.

Since vaccine designed induce high antibody response, there's risk vaccine could lead vaccine able induce type antibody response, would potentially place otherwise healthy children risk severe outcome following vaccination intended prevent illness SARS‐CoV‐2.

That study concluded risk-benefit vaccination would still likely worth it, things taken consideration talking rare adverse reactions COVID infection rare adverse reactions vaccination also exists. law enforcement, fairly young (early 20s) proceed get vaccination? tier list country released puts frontline workers like priority, regardless age. relatives come occasional contact already vaccinated. 
Another question, doc! mother 49, suffers allergy causes terrible rashes triggered. GP recommended standby getting vaccinated, although majority folks we've talked say worry. get vaccinated risk several weeks terrible rashes? Sorry, meant table (will update). Thx. Nope. vitro. study submitted doctors Beijing New England Journal Medicine state like 30% ? got first shot lol   Amazing results, clear link specific gender age.

This listed leaflet ""very rare side effects"", way medicines cupboard list ""death"" rare side effect. Lately I’ve seeing lot people, even experts, saying ‘we need hold little longer’ someone almost fully vaccinated anxious get back life it’s getting kind annoying. reasonable go back genuine normal (everything open 100%, masks, etc)? actual hurdles need cross? know CDC conservative estimates point benefits restrictions really worth simply reasonable anymore? chance get vaccine local clinic surplus, they're trying give go bad. However, two months I'm 16. I'm trying decide whether get it. want anything illegal, especially something stay (the vaccine card lists DOB). parents doctors, dad works ICU critical care COVID patients. want it. I'm worried medical side effects, legal side. think? Yeah understand mask mandates setting everyone vaccinated. There's nothing vaccines. Beyond that, life. yea america... click bait home wife cat see much. That's 8 hrs day supposed working coworkers seeing anyway.  wonder, then, kind spike occur Texas Rangers packed 40,000 screaming fans Texas Stadium three-hour baseball game Monday, yesterday, today, tomorrow, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, next Monday, next Tuesday, etc. Try last couple decades. Minorities US example likely skeptical type things completely valid reasons goverment previously performed medical experiments without bothering ask consent. went hopefully vaccinated wore mask. Otherwise get sick infect friends family members. share moms? hello brother/sister spoken like someone doesnt actually read SCMP Pretty sure neurologist know means UCLA pediatric Dr J.

""I hope ready 2 days feeling like shit gets second dose.""

No idea kind anti vaxxer assholes post here, seems quite few. people meaningful reaction second dose, anti vaxxers gonna asshole. Dr. Frieden,
As scientist working COVID, big concern previous outbreaks: address immediate concern without really prepping future. changes make policy level prepared next pandemic, whatever agent may be?

Also, based efforts lawmakers, see paradigm-shifting event future public health infectious disease management? Kicked ass everyone know got well. surprised I'd heard less side effects sounds bit dull. pretty challenging make new friends adult, job really great place it, especially work sort field tends attract people similar interests. mention people actually ""real"" family. 

I would love hybrid model this. WFH nice, actually meeting people work couple times per week something really miss. Even introvert who's making online friends since 13, talking Discord Zoom really can't replace person meetings. business leisure. ok fed drip Ramadan? worked except work LA infected place world. Every place ebbs flows, can't claim things worked ebbs can't blame things flows. 

Not sure best policies retrospect impact tough business restrictions seems mixed best. Sorry, got infected covid 2 weeks getting covid vaccine?  Oh boo hoo, got work remote 2 weeks. much always love showing work, feel like get much work done. Governments around world responding COVID19 putting strict lockdowns populations, using case numbers taken PCR tests like justification. cases actual verified illnesses, people tested positive traces virus. using statistics actual verified illnesses doctor visits? Got vaccinated Fremont, Ca yesterday. 

They asked ID (driver license) proof age / residency.  Insurance card optional.  asked much bill insurance, said.  

&amp;#x200B;

I sure open folks without ID/Driver license soon vaccines available, since probably vulnerable part population. July 3rd July 5th? fucking obvious political theater July 4th. C’mon, man! would love continue work home. work field office 99% building work different divisions myself. Also 99.999% work working colleagues entirely different countries other, different, field offices. Maybe take step back evaluate hard immediately find someone credible support claims. finding someone support converse trivially easy.  point miss office seeing people outside house. easy commute though. capacity limit ""mask mandate"" (wear building, one stop don't). California planning date ""full reopening"" minus masks. Texas barely average death rate US, would hardly call good bad compared states. ""Completely safe""? Nope. Neither are. show ID get bar?

are metal detectors airports?

are license drive car? exactly bum?

- I'm homeless -- live apartment

- I'm unemployed -- salaried $40,000/year job

Oh, I'm bum like play video games, watch TV, smoke weed? Weird. must *a lot* bums that's bum is. That’s dangerous irresponsible. openings domesticated animals vaccinated well. Vaccinating wild ones tricky, think we’re challenge. BS. can't j&amp;j continue normal production? haphazard. glad georgia Mississippi getting allocation states like Wisconsin Michigan getting hit hard  dope, nice going Sandals. love went photo op went “yep, doin kitty zippy” I'm sure are. never concerned severe illness death. always worried long term effects COVID. hopeful get data showing vaccinated basically risk developing long term effects don’t know yet. take steps keep safe long-term health standpoint. tell us upcoming treatments serious symptoms (hospitilizations, ICU, etc.)? aware currently going trials look promising, give us idea available? Thanks! keep bandage one year straight hope everything magically heal itself? nice logic. put bandage on,you go hospital soon possible.You don’t sit around chill saw story local news channel guy long covid stroke like symptoms. He’s relearn certain tasks. I’m telling you, pandemic broken people’s brains. stories see people getting dirty looks wearing mask outside walking still make laugh. Protests indoor concession areas restrooms, protestors pack nearby bars main event. Hello Dr. Frieden, think end precautions regards masks social distancing Covid-19 based current vaccination rate? also see long term side effects vaccine believe completely safe? Food services open stadium... bring food back seat outside eat. I'm guessing everyone smart legally wear mask leave seats bathroom wearing mask. Masks still essentially back normal here. zero enforcement it. Pfizer Moderna mRNA based vaccines, whereas AstraZeneca J&amp;J use adenoviruses. production mRNA based vaccines reliable, hence difference delivery reliabilities companies.

Pretty obvious. ask Luigi meaningful data. Biden banning them, right? States like NY want? Counties want? Individual businesses want?

Abbot DeSantis restricting localities businesses want.

That pretty major difference, would think anti-""big government"" types would appreciate difference. wasn’t talking virus risk vaccines actually know, AZ getting bad press deserving not. Either way point don’t really need it, three vaccines supply increasing every day. vaccine also drastically reduces chance spread, least Pfizer likely Moderna (don't know J&amp;J). theory, one contracts virus, nose, never gets sick spreads it.

Sounds good me. believe anything read online, unless fits moronic knuckle dragging troglodyte agenda ridiculous self-centred ideas everything Totally agree. Hence new focus ""cases"" cos deaths hospitalizations months back.

IG (SO) // MDR feel bad people travelled pandemic, government basically pleading people stay home.

I pointed host non frivolous reasons people would NEED travel abroad. frame topic terms vacationing rich people, sure hard feel sorry. step back realize people legitimate need travel (not fun), gets easier feel sympathy folks. 

That point. Go ahead, precise. want done protesters? ""Disbanding case public orders ignored"" exactly done far, stricter measures mind? Something like Myanmar? subsidizing anything. vast majority funerals already occurred .  People don’t care anymore. I’m pretty sure won’t help   looked Chile's curves see wrong. slight increase deaths, line Latin American countries, explosion like Brazil. Perhaps vaccination prevented happening. stand corrected. 

I knew Europe (as continent) higher number, impression EU (political entity) still lower terms deaths. Looks like really saying ""Hold beer.""

That said, EU 446 million population, 330million. Though way things going may even beat us per capita measure soon. Well considering funerals already occurred may kinda hard Water wet. thing concerns keep seeing people push virtual option. I’m teacher relieved vaccinated feeling much better safety. slightly half kids school still virtual (parents choice). talking next year I’m starting hear people community push back don’t “need” virtual option next school year “takes resources” person kids. feel like half parents don’t feel safe now, might change kids get vaccinated. can’t dismiss safety concerns many families, really hope keep offering virtual choice want it. also hope hire dedicated teachers group, say trying simultaneously disservice groups kids.  Yeah, I’m Novavax trial blood work every six months 2023 believe. Yellow card use currently issued governments. ""experts"" really sound like desperately want vaccination fail. seemed almost frustrated vaccination took off. Moderna production EU UK? Exciting see this. hope ready 2 days feeling like shit gets second dose. Thea ""flu like symptoms"" ain't joke. Speedy recovery! 1. Hopefully UK's vaccines better.
2. surge started time low vaccine rollout vaccines still caught up.
3. proportion serious cases death vaccinated (difficult compare unvaccinated also controlling age health conditions)? ...and, please, properly time. We're half-assed lockdown since October see less necessary wearing everyone without significant impact. there's enough popular support get us mandated lockdown; slap face everyone cooperating since year critical-thinking-parade gets gather 15,000-25,000 people every weekend another city police claims better remove masked/distanced people neighborhood following orders enforce masks&amp;distancing ""Corona-critical protests"" (or disbanding case public orders ignored) That’s defense experts on, good though talks fake hysterical bullshit though? interesting case study.  I’m sure controversial shitty opinion - I’ve thinking vaccinating older people first maybe wrong order.

I get they’re dying higher rates strain system, also people age retired / longer working afford stay home longer lot people younger them. using less effective Chinese vaccines. Take look Israel better comparison near future situation UK/US. hell baseball game dam church something?

Yesterday roughly 203228 vaccines administered.

But, ability give vaccines perhaps it’s time look local public health agency. got mine around time yesterday don’t feel anything either minor injection site soreness. lockdown worked properly, desired effect, past 14 months, logical solution lockdown harder. United States ranked last mathematical literacy amongst English speaking countries . reference UK also appalling, 79% adults would struggle calculate percentage, 49% adults mathematical literacy primary school children.

Doesn't stop everyone giving opinion death transmission rates ,or mitigation supression models require advanced mathematics statistics though. friend mine, 30s training marathon, got covid summer. Almost year later still trouble going walk, breathing laborious, fog brain. think people miscalculate price paid 85year old vs potential life long impact young people. mean, asked me, rather have, living long term issue 30yr old vs dying 85, it’s brainer Canadas siutation sounds similar germanys.

Events mixing probably cards time.

There practically reasons positive there's basically certainty better tomorrow. New Zealand adequate response, top raising minimum wage (unlike 'Murica) COVID r number around 3 measures taken prevent spread - enough population vaccinated August prevent surge cases despite phenomenonal work NHS. reality obstacles still overcome. vaccines begun magic solution saving rest 2021. Sorry bearer bad news. Sad logic, wear masks forever never 100% Bonafide masks selling since august $3.50 ( packs 20 ). I’m starting see Walmart Home Depot well. What? Law enforcement lol things deducted taxes end year. paid for? Absolutely. illegal. Personally speaking feel. like office atmosphere times hate commuting locked area. Would nice get chores done breaks, relax clock out. 
Give people choice, let mix two, morale go up. get shit done person people meetings. get shit done home need put head work.

Yeah, lot us fall latter category only, *don't* need host meetings sit long discussions work. UK significantly higher % population risk due age. expect Brazil get anywhere close UK unless significant failing elsewhere. No, Texas generally agree, CA strict lockdowns (maybe paper). LA SF locked hard, counties stayed open pretty much entire pandemic. Anybody else get jittery first Moderna dose? got mine two hours ago feel like I'm riding adrenaline high. Agreed - needed face problem. needed newsfeeds filled video people getting winded going flight stairs talking brain fog ruined life. convinced die-hard denialists, like politics need convince person's base, need peel reasonable 10% 20% People screaming ""if AZ causes dangerous clots, UK reported numbers compared places like Norway?!?!"" turns us Anglo's magically immune either - government see fit fucking tell us forced to. Every industry designed exploit us profit, lot it. want loved ones struggling plan they're supposed body ahead time go instead preyed upon scramble grief stricken state. want choice. get people would want go in, I'm happiest I've ever working home refuse work company make go back all. Yeah leaving would better stress that's eviscerating 401k. would clear debt mortgage leave nice 6-12 month cushion well CC fully paid available sudden expenses. would lose vacation start over.

It honestly appealing missed calls am. look forward full re-opening country means going double busy one hired last 12 months idea looks like even prepared it. summer going ROUGH! expect absolute truck ton turn-over since current management c-level retiring see writing wall. going likely worst thing thats ever happened country people going along hunky-dorry. confirm. tacos fire. Luckily Kern county 50-60 daily cases last couple weeks CSUB vaxxing people 16+ without required appointments week I’m 33 walked got mine week half ago appointment necessary. main worry vaccine hesitancy real. Meh, specific different roles industries. lot people work independently issues. Basically means essentially, take anything away sentence... Time unionize! worked university parking facilities athletic department worked compensated budget. jobs require payed parking paid commute reasonable amount included salary. negotiation especially find out. Obviously offering shouldn’t Uber rides train car reasonable ways get there, cost parking offset. still pay gas. inversely. wanted get stuff taken taxes definitely can. need diligent get gas, parking whatever else necessity job deducted end year. fixes. One thing different right future, lack in-person social interaction. work home becomes standard, get 5:00 go see friends. right there's pandemic, fingers crossed soon. Read lines. people threaten quit jobs altogether layabouts apply unemployment use hammock. know beforehand they'll they're already unwilling come work.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  women gotten vaccination though. Men also fatal blood clots vaccination. This. Wasn’t really worried dying parents died lung stuff years suffering - trying follow footsteps yet parts worst case rates. That’s read, seems fit timeline I’ve reading. husband arranged work. gets done home commuting people aren’t walking office interrupting day. also gets exercise breaks get family time lunches together too. Sigh. there's company - we've working home we've mandated government. productivity every metric across company. Every meeting HR general feedback meeting management multiple people asking flexible work arrangements post-covid every time response ""working remotely part culture here"". referring strictly B.1.1.7 avoid stigmatizing British people. headlines encourage xenophobia. assumed meant, ""settling job less annoying others still hate it.""

I can't imagine anyone enjoy working job ultimately makes someone never met money ever see. guess really kinds people. Well yes, last 2 weeks UK vaccinated 3 million people first dose, take account symptoms type clots take 6 days present, autopsy determine cause death. 

Or know jump straight conspiracy theory explanation. know also amazing? don’t go office you’re sick get people sick ass backwards standards US. Thank you, will. company always allowed folks work home (during non office hours) energizer bunnies always manage burn out. 100% this. Know setting 1 1 &lt;2-3 people start building working relationships totally healthy build chit chat in. make sure going meeting times otherwise abusing people's time. 

My industry heavy conference calls remote types work (dev teams spread geographically) aside maybe 1-2 trips year see people also fully engaging online. open non work related topic seeing someone person. prefer “relaxed” dress code they’ve grown used home.

Like sitting computer wearing underwear using pizza box mousepad? Yeah, could get used that. trying kill grandmother?!? Agree. I’ve ways- friends work friends work. Ultimately friends didn’t add much value day; also made feel weird people would throw bus take credit work. like “bro thought friends.” - no, work friendship never true friendship never equated much loyalty longevity. Sure, really analyzing contact tracing data see activities causing infections order say shouldn’t doing.

I’m frankly little surprised didn’t happen 10 months+ ago Calm down.

They happened Canada, Italy one early on, etc. worked. absolutely disruptive... everyone, especially kids. Hey feel stupid question...but vaccine less severe side effects (first second dose) moderna vs pfizer?
I live state options left right. anxiety disorder I’m really scared side effects. biggest fear side effect nausea. want vaccinated ..thanks bet he’s total stiff. Hi thanks joining us today!

I remember something catching heat hiring bunch title 42s/title 5s Ebola. think CDC might over-reliant temporary/non-benefited employees? pros cons large portion contract-only staff CDC? AZ served legal notice Indian drug maker production delay. think amazing many given, really can't compared US pace vaccination. Also bragging supplying world vaccine way stated. country prohibitively expensive healthcare social safety net

That sounds awful! live, undeveloped country suffering generational decay caused legacy colonial exploitation perhaps currently grips civil war entire economic social system collapsed? America? already pointed out, Chick-fil-a way employees likely reason outbreaks. Even able socially distance, sheer numbers increase likelihood one person bringing in, takes. 

This whole exchange started blaming Chick-fil-a employing maskless jesus freaks. That’s point I’m defending. fast food employees restaurant young likely whatever want. It’s mask slipping seconds see every time. mask never falls it’s hard wear ones fits. nose out, it’s don’t give fuck. 

And agree specifics virus actually transmitted risk extremely low. social contract principal thing. point getting people sick work following mask etiquette. It’s people won’t even that, also quarantining staying away friends/family social events. think going church one dumbest riskiest things I’ve thankful able skip year. going bars restaurants especially large home gatherings. getting downvoted?

Because sound gleeful. reservations this, too, please try sound compassionate serious ""Virus go brr."" Or, like people willfully spreading mutable disease potential detriment rest nation. dude I've cultivated voice thing years working industry apparently shows, clients' customer groups range across bunch different groups, I'll get hawk older ladies asking I'm married blushing college girls saying cute dorky stuff like ""you really cool voice..."" if/when meet people person I'm thinking ""this must catfishing feels like"" give stories set loose, white boarding, tech meetings fluff don’t need day.

tell junior developer without telling junior developer Although everything works perfectly applying vaccine vaccination centres still side, government not. leading famous scientists (doctors, epidemiologist...) close ti government pro-goverment media were, beginning downsizing dangers getting covid, questioning speed developing vaccine praising ""strong serbian"" bodies minds prevail covid tea honey minerals. Naturally, bombarded kind opinions several doctors year half expected way lot people want vaccinated. say lot 22% tells many. day around 2 million doses (az, sputnik, BT, sinopharm) enough people willing take it. So, simple. Ah yes, Norway massive plot UK AZ...

What joke sub is. emergency kids? know could waited 2 months 70%+ vaccinated. Instead thousands catch virus many die boneheaded decisions like this. pandemic isn’t yet. Probably due fire facility hybrid schedule would best option people, though see many places offering that.

Yup. I'm fortunate company changed permanent 'come please' schedule. Everyone (company, employers, employees) winning. really hope companies start moving way. kinda like leaving work work, taking work home seems like would bug Same. sleep lunch breaks pre-pandemic sleep 15-30mins lunch break. Add extra hour sleep morning commute anymore, say sleep lot WFH setup. everyone long commute

[""The average American commute grew 27 minutes one way 
that's 5 extra unpaid work hours week. recommended still get vax minimum 14 days end quarantine period, definitely 90 days team switched full remote, 4/10 work week, amazing. Feels like get ""deep work"" done day, nice 3 day weekend. Going hard go back this! going go roadhead... problem really clear, clear. Logic always translate, etc. whole heartedly agree CDC needs agile, think lot people believe whole lot things clear (scientifically) are. scientific process needs happen first. political leaders never bright. idea would hard transmit Covid outside obvious anybody would lukewarm IQ.

Here’s post end December;

Ever house someone spray painted end getting huge nasty dose paint painting outdoors difference 1000 1? keep group enclosed space long one person it, guaranteed eventually everyone it. stuff rocket science, apparently nanny politicians. look way run departments budgets Commuting! Next going ask pay utilities! man taking everything! Funnily enough, France's lockdowns longer considerably strict Germany, louding german response complaining France lock hard showing affidavit police justifying home September.

I really see logic post. EU leadership basically repeated said.

And lockdowns, saying leaders bad job mis-using lockdowns, know compare France Germany. France definitely one worst developed countries handling situation (UK worse 2021 thanks BoJo's incompetence, hard lockdown + rushing 1st doses helped lot), spend time Internet critisizing Macron's terrible leadership. realize concessions, lines, bathrooms, stairs, escalators, indoor parts maintain separation airflow right? true love commitment shit. That's long haul, especially rush hour. Yeah told nurse hate needles told worry felt like backhand stabbed lol. needle didnt hurt rough haha. long ago covid? took 7 hours get actual side effects outside sore arm. California? Sonoma County it’s particularly shut school. Unless afford private schools mostly open full time like governor - kids school full time months 🙃 basically walking age range, making sure safe effective level. inflammatory conditions seen Covid kids, we'll need sure rare adverse event vaccine.

Because children rarely get ill Covid, urgency getting vaccines much less. Also, risk/benefit vaccination important assess carefully. Thanks! Maybe so, assuming 30% population 30% vaccinated, assuming cross-over two average level, means 51% immunity. 

That's enough herd immunity event like that; albeit bad would time last year. Here’s reminder CDC probably *NEVER* give green light act normally. you’re waiting tell it’s safe vaccination, it’s never coming. They’ve shown hand messaging. Even cases US &lt;10k deaths &lt;200 day I’m sure still going distancing masking. It’s take life back you’re vaccinated, CDC sure shit isn’t going ever come say “ok guys crowded bars safe now”. I’d suggest stop waiting something that’s never coming. could take years reintegrate people, it’s kind sad. 
 
I opposite, felt invincible getting second dose, already felt safer two weeks first. able identify risk factors. early tell due rarity. Based presentation done MHRA/JCVI today risk 20-29 group 'serious harm' vaccine something like 1/100k. roughly risk someone age group getting fatal accident given month.

I'm sure name polyhedra 100k faces would make interesting dice. Certainly healthy 35 year old extra factors protect you, say example live rural area little covid cases, definitely reassuring, seem worth getting AZ vaccine vs waiting. boundaries problem WFH problem. Stop tying differ them. really hate people like „WFH isn’t problem hundred specific things work“. WFH doesn’t work lot people exactly many problems it. Yea hear you, case perfect help. ways would sensible let people decide themselves. everybody wants mRNA vaccine, reopening society probably delayed several months. Yes uncalled comments Brits attacking EMA investigating legitimate concerns, proven wrong, like definitely people posting downvoting you. Brits nationalists, especially Reddit. are, continental Europeans are. Tarring whole nation brush they're kind homogeneous entity sounds lot like nationalist mentality itself... I’m disabled (legally blind) working home perfect me. want sick people stay home. feel real driver keeping sickness away school year, lot kids otherwise would sent “it’s cold” held home. small school full time class year. segment CBS couple weeks ago issue seems split among people children don’t. also seemed vary age living situation. Many people children found less productive home many younger people missed opportunity social interaction. People ample space home tended prefer home cramped quarters home wanted office. children live rurally, zero interest returning office. Yep. “love job” assume mean “can’t stand kids” haha one day think. week long average. Consistency matters long term. India ahead US days average yet caught 2%.

I genuinely want know they'd want go back old way. rat race commute pointless, bad environment, expensive, awful physically mentally. sit around wait government check.

this article people jobs m8. whatever want. Death effect covid. Imagine kid growing life long medical complications parents want ""just live scared forever."" irresponsible. need look long covid gain prospective, think wanting catch novel virus = living scared forever. battle thinking folk fighting year - ""Why care disease 99.5% survival rate!?"" binary live/die outcome spectrum. decent chance sicker ever 2 weeks smaller still still significant chance suffering aftereffects months years. 

Herpes, Lyme disease, shingles kill either, mean I'm OK catching them. 

Not mention even 0.5%ish death rate still means half million people died. respect that. also think useful us see time time. also think major benefits individually society stop forcing commute office need to. actually handle meetings home person, sleep structure day way take advantage natural periods routine rather desk need appear busy (my real busy period usually hits 2pm-7pm - sacrifice morning example shift personal stuff up?). 

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately I'd ok hybrid requires 1-2 days week office. entirely true numbers per county, though. work county DOH, hopefully county DOH services reports local paper periodically like do, Florida counties less 20% 16+ fully vaccinated, less 30% one dose. counties 25% eligible population vaccinated- safe there?

If can’t play sports something else them: parents need fucking parent parenting dumping someone else enrich matter it’s indoors outdoors. stepson bored sad anytime he’s house engaged him.

Overall, influenza deaths dropped 2020 social distanced wore masks! I'm trying offensive, I'm pretty sure opposite true world. That's kicker, reasonably confident cheap labor mix that's company comes in.

Even devs cheap labor team relatively confident cheap labor countries hammer devs forced time many projects handle much time get wasted zoning out, 8 hours work much fully used productively.

For creative work? bet. 

Completely agreement. absolutely personal stuff company time. 

As long contributions triple benefits, assure are, take flying leap problem throwing load laundry work day, etc. Yes! 2 hour commute way? That’s insane. read AZ spain limited 60 people (like 15 minutes old news) following EU thing happened today, still means relative afraid still stuck astrazeneca. missed today appointment going vaccinate her, TV started ""latest news"" AZ europe fuss Leon suddenly cancelling vaccinations, appointment like 15 minutes... imagine sudden panic. wonder call again. I've already gotten Pfizer, good, took extra allergy meds hand could less anxiety, allergist approved strategy Sounds like whatever choose, Uncle Sam picking tab. Go big go home! case, maybe need also thank Trump finding Operation Warp Speed. visually watch someone work know accomplishing,

Especially common office worker champion bullshitting slow days away looking busy *literal decades.*

Fucking boomers act like we're still pushing Model Ts assembly line... like... white collar work *ever* let alone 20-fucking-21. Interesting.. would calculations second dose? close zero ICU admission vs 1.1? 100% ghost school too, called skipping taking 20 minute bathroom breaks. Frankly I'm dissappointed experts made better explanations virus symptoms, control, risk year.

They said need masks, said need fresh mask time, masks protect you... could've said beginning reuse masks protecting others, especially confined spaces.

Similarly, ventilation sunlight considered crutial prevention mechanism late. Anyone dealt molds know ventilation key way create hostile environment microorganisms, virus included.

When came covid symptoms lot permanent effects traced oxygen deprivation. 
Long covid symptoms like fatigue unique virus something bad flu could give you, except infectious slightly higher risk young people. Risk almost negligible children.
They also insistent focusing symptoms racial disparities poverty factors.

We're getting two polarized groups, paranoid group never go exercise all, believe lockdown acceptable control, no-mask anti-vax group understand point masks.

Now people believe vaccine toxic chemical cause blood clots reasonable assumptions there.  appointment tomorrow get Pfizer mass vax location 30 minutes away, morning get word extremely small local health clinic 5 minutes away got shipment J&amp;J, I'm getting Friday.  much, small W. Oh god I’m salesperson Agreed, reason people care kids fall cracks. spewing even disinformation here. know far people zero mild effects second jab claim absolutely 100% chance two days feeling like shit. Infectoids... Found Extrovert. understand someone saying vaccine's side effects made feel bad make anti-vaxxer spreading lies? Plus rent goes 3% year, thousands dollars since huge amount hating country. poor substitute absent personality.

You roasted half Reddit 2 sentences. started job remotely month ago it’s awesome. Really looking forward essentially doubling salary moving Bay Area months. definitely want hybrid schedule requires live area houses cost million dollars. wants go back commute zombie keeps trying counter ""what going see class system develop people come office seen committed get recognized promoted often it.""

This, me, reads ""toxic workplaces use rejection trend towards WFH one many toxic 'badges honor' use bully people"". Yet anti-vaccination lies.  keep going - love sub lets anti vaccination lies ""OMG SURE WANT DIE GET JAB!!!"" know dozens people minimal side effects jab. true. know over-70s man got AZ Italy today. wife (same age) given Pfizer risk factors. appointment, morning. Sorry I’m dumbass, good right?  choose university offers online classes I'm them. job even dedicated space work office. I'm programmer share room people whose job talk day people coming out. can't work like that. try send back office thing I'll work looking new job. Yes, take vitamins, especially Vitamins K, long winters here. Youre kind over-estimating prevalence good internet rural areas, least point time. hell even happen? mean, get Brazil's leadership incompetent, even downright evil, can't S.A. say leaving country right hot spots? little planning, controls, sacrifice, shit like could avoided. know several people 20s saying thing, they’re anti Vaxxers either. picked social media. “I’m holding JJ, mess DNA”. Oh, tables turned. seems really individual, work different company every 6-12 months contract, met colleagues year+, really care. Teams/Zoom etc still see people important stuff. Phones exist. 

What I've realized without long commute stress dressing nice professional, Wednesday / Thursday nights fall asleep 7 8pm 5.30 home 6. really feel like got personality back commute-zombie.

I miss social aspect work, happened work hours team, normal work hours. Well, Bye. Nevermind, see made auto-mod clutch pearls. People links property investments. always cases virus. pandemic end, disease going anywhere.

We know yet. sure hell wash everything then? flu season (or hell, anytime - still catch flu July!)? 

The difference flu kill me. distanced gathering largely outdoors

So study admitting outdoor events, especially protests similar gatherings, potentially dangerous? want normal, I'll person "" renaissance faire"" weekend job.that's plenty interaction. toxic office, stuck long enough get pension never want again.  first sentence post. reading HARD antivaxx types right? agree least AZ, doubt AZ authorized US, At-risk group already vaccinated, younger group, benefits AZ vaccine shrink greatly due risk blood clots, may actually deadly female kids &lt;18. “I told Reddit make friends people forced around said need better social skills” daily mega thread April 7? u take multivitamins? ...Australia New Zealand. right, question soon become irrelevant considering number vaccinations done. government lifts covid restrictions, businesses business (no pun intended) requiring vaccinations imo. know teacher gonna lose funding parents arent interested public education anymore. correct, complete nonsense basis reality. Since vaccine designed induce high antibody response, there's risk vaccine could lead vaccine able induce type antibody response, would potentially place otherwise healthy children risk severe outcome following vaccination intended prevent illness SARS‐CoV‐2.

This unlikely. Adults severe COVID-19 also higher levels anti-RBD abs, neutralizing abs, abs N. Vaccinated individuals higher titers abs (except N) found convalescent patients. tells us need virus initially harmful effect. likely due autoantibodies induced virus hyperinflammatory response virus seen vaccination. neutralizing antibodies harmful. response virus that's harmful. high titers neutralizing antibodies start, protective immunity allow virus induce hyperinflammatory response. I've worked remote 5 year now. guidance always ""work room get away work"". Well kinda goes far considering still shit need finish ""room"" right there. lol I'm dying inside. 3 days week office going get post-pandemic. wanted 1 day, boss wanted 5 landed 3. Maybe negotiate extra day year else might look different place. 

Definitely thing I'm gonna ask looking jobs now. hope changed whole office culture bit make easier everyone future get HO. confused lockdown “emergency brake” orders. 

Same shit, different pile. Ты что серьезно чувак? Тут все могут использовать Google Translate. Тут доказывать ничего не надо. Ну люди пошли. лол seen lot stories field success vaccines, big run last week. hired, funded, promoted. That’s Biden team does. Sigh - read actual article past headline. guys still jobs? ticket work. pretending getting second means get SICK disinformation. happens minority recipients. anti-vaxxers love spread lies. probably come time. HR arrange everyone get shots conference room one uses.  come office committed.

Haha. Nope. people care enough generate results productive. Spending hours commuting every day sort sacrefice show committed - using measure commitment stone age.

We've seen huge amount productivity people working home - that's commitment.. bums seats farm. Jeeez.  said ""incivil""? gladly return office 34% rest people don't. Hiked 900 miles 2019....300 2020 everything crowded hell. Definitely gained weight holed home constantly. Completely agree pure stupidity I've seen past year outstanding. starve province BC also cases P1 variant outside Brazil. hockey team could done season 21 players 4 coaching staff contracted (Covid variant haven’t confirmed one) fuck Seems like PA may plateaued due vaccines, increasing, day 5000 cases yet. stuck 1800's? people mindset survive 21st century world baffles me.

Here's know. live society large percentage population supposedly ""educated"" yet real practical skills. people bitching complaining student debt load government owes money. way people contribute rest society get useless white collar job enables put money back economy. actually produce anything, least help pay actual work people do. consume; produce. (In sense white collar jobs exist sake blue collar jobs)

And damn people want stay home pajamas collect essentially free check. somebody hates driving, 45 minute commute would enough make quit job altogether. is, fact, bad commute. never claimed otherwise. exported EU. said US allowing doses exported. Pay attention. impossible productive either place. office dick around talking bs im home answer questions teams mobile linked. Video games fiddling garage day long ”ill tomorrow” many factors though. Many people hate job, terrible commute, hate social interaction, etc. Many people love job short commute enjoy getting house interacting people. choice mix. full time office go.  Scottish, Welsh English people British, Ireland UK. no. ah yes, ""gig"" economy, aka ""you hustle 24/7 order earn less minimum wage""

fuck gig economy. many extra fees. may making 21/hr upfront, taxes, insurance, equipment, making less 6/hr. think people taking joke waaaaay literally (and seriously). wonder groups going go fully anti vax next since appear keep seeking new topics create outrage matter damage society. damages civil discourse, health wellbeing followers. someone works tech company, WFH really awesome especially company spread across 3 offices, one offices overseas work people 3 offices.

It makes work life much easier able 9 deal overseas office, lunch 5 I'm working people US office. use drive 1+ hour (could much 1 1/2 - 2 hours) to/from work office finally asked transition WFH months pandemic started.

Now get time family evenings, still get talk maintain friendships office, even us game together gaming channel chat gaming. Got first dose Pfizer hours ago.

My niece born last June. first baby immediate family. abundance caution, I've ever gotten around mask on. I'm close finally able kiss first time started crying thinking it.

It's long road, long year. light finally coming. That's reddit though. Ive ever teachers truly disliked, one didnt least begrudging respect Uk, government uses term “the variant first detected …” eg Kent, South Africa, Brazil sort neat would vaccine neutralized? would anyone cross-reactive immunity lipid nanoparticles? Simply allergy enough neutralize vaccine. IgE antibodies present extremely low concentrations. Extremely low. Don’t thank politicians. Thank scientists, public health officials, distributors never see tv. also talk universal influenza vaccine. That’s arguably even important! People want avoid families lol said anything forcing anyone anything? shitty job see value giving people options 100% problem. Every time call someone ask give credible source get told go research. Give bullet brain forcing back dreadful office environment.  Huge operative word. Full time office commuting sucks. full time alone home time sometimes. miss social interaction. previous job let us work home one day week amazing. could choose certain days office certain home would ideal. 300 million doses Pfizer AZ vaccine already administered COVAX. idea you’re talking about. fault countries decided order vaccines. *Jeff stares cat* know 5000/month = 60,000 right?

And 120,000 salary taxes closer 90,000. 

So it’s surviving $30,000 year (2500/month) pay utilities, healthcare, transportation, food, everything else city expensive since pay workers enough survive. seriously think people consider anxiety brain disease? Surely meant it’s psychiatric disorder, incredibly common one that. 

Just clickbait titles. started remote last November never met co-workers person honestly love it.

On-boarding definitely challenge can't ask person next help, got speed, definitely feel productive working office job (granted, office job decade).

The linked article says WFH saves average worker $4,000 per year, average U.S. wage means WFH savings 7.7 percent average income.

What meant Spain Italy countries reserve Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J 65s use AstraZeneca exclusively 65s.

All countries either give AZ everyone (Portugal, UK although going change, etc.), one (Switzerland, US, South Africa, Norway, etc.) older cohorts (France, Germany, extent UK). Spain Italy countries give precisely groups makes less sense (see image article).

Regarding choice, think countries one can't choose vaccine (in can, e.g. Poland). think models pinning actual number 10x. like 4x-6x. Here's good source: 

Even 6x, hell even 10x, would fifth world's population, low incidence long-term serious side effects recovered persons deeply unfortunate warrant hyperbolic, borderline apocalyptic statements ""QOL permanently reduced everyone.""

It opinion UK decided stop giving vaccine 60's week two ago like many locations result would overwhelmingly harmful.

Like raise whole hoohar pretty much guaranteed best response carry information gathered, means delaying data 1 week evaluated made confirmable actionable steps that's fine me.

For personally every part brain protesting every decision seems come EU seems undermine trust faith vaccine process, UK citizen would way happier managed decisions made information published would citizen many places Europe.

Anyhow let's catch 1 week see new, I'll wait patiently Canada (I care darn one get!!) vaccine around May/June time :(

Wtf world coming to... yet see company offer internally externally.


Even current employer offers match probably bad idea take it. already made decision jump ship might see liability.

As applicant, even partial wfh schedule means less hours dedicated work (commuting), fewer costs like transit parking fees, eating less, ability chores breaks, probably dozen things I'm thinking moment. 

All benefits cost company nothing. Even better, outsources costs onto employee, may allow downsizing office space. giving option drastically improve offering save money. obvious win everyone.

100% wfh share downsides well, like lower collaboration abilities, hybrid approach negates almost them. long period less traffic less people crowd building cafeteria, say many us work person would prefer lot folks stay home, least time. UK clowning. Jesus christ... people live 2 hour commute work? commute 20 minutes even bothers sometimes. could never two hours would literally go insane.

That option. meetings stuff better person. would gladly commute work week hours. better 5 times every week. 

Well would rather work either. problem looking minimum number looking optimal number. least time spent office. already see live vast majority workplaces going back pre-2020 ways. Almost none I’ve heard learned listened employees preferring working home hybrid schedule, giving capability option.

It’s really sad. hoping real positive change past year regards working habits work/life balance seems dinosaurs top refuse change. It’s staggering much technology sped improved daily work almost everywhere yet we’re still stuck basic 5 day, 40 hour week.  could always going walk. 

Part transitioning WFH finding analogues parts “before.” Frankly it’s easier others, it’s absolutely doable. 

With 30 min commute you’re giving two weeks life every year. That’s full 24 hours * 14 ish days get back life.

My employer recently annual employee survey incredibly leading questions try guide employees towards saying WFH undesirable (eg, question asked rate scale 1-5 disruptive WFH was, nothing lets rank alternative, say anything positive WFH).

Even then, employer get results wanted so, brought survey annual company-wide meeting, omitted WFH questions discussion.

I know multiple--nearly *indispensable*--people who'd leave immediately forced go back office reason. I'm certain someone business degree paid lot money make stupid decision subject. demand shut outdoors!!! demand everyone hide behind 50layers cloth thy cellar! Sounds like Seattle.

It's easy find talent offer competitve wages, flexible work schedules (i.e. work home), good team. higher value employees, better talent less turnover draw in.

Participate don’t; choice. It’s really easy. I’m confused safe one Pfizer dose. I’ve heard starts working 10-14 days first dose. Would dumb start socializing going restaurants getting second dose? Sorry dumb question I’m overly excited start going again. Hey ended calling unblinded well. Turns placebo group. sucks, sort relieved things pointed out. even think would happen regarding trying travel without FDA approved vaccine.

Hope situation gets better soon regarding that. ""Then Trump done something help. Better late never.""

Help what? Stopping virus? keep asking, help containing virus getting us back normal?

You stupid man. answer question. 

You put Trump comment pretend ego justified people blindly hate him. Now, can't explain wrote respond telling re-read wrote. LEAST 6 months.

God damn vaccines insanely effective!!!!  wife &amp; got J&amp;J yesterday.... relatively severe fever 9 hours post shot wife almost side effects. took ibuprofen middle night pretty much spent day lethargic minor headache. also went drinking watch basketball game probably didn’t help. allows less restrictions people vaccinated go around maskless without worry. title says LEAST. Also, read article. agree  fuck still mask shit, vaccinated? Makes absolutely zero sense. Either masks vaccination. please lift export ban now? soon second dose y'all start feeling side effects? Currently going 8 hours since second shot still feeling much. I've heard 12 hours? symptoms far? assume businesses dont want become spreader events theyre fully open lot unvaccinated folks show up. governor responsibility act best interests constituents regardless personal views. Can't really get elected otherwise. 3 hospital systems area say testing, state requirements symptoms. CVS says limited supplies, Walgreens seem problem. guess hope Walgreens one tests listed Canadian travel requirements list. reversed mandate taking control government's hands let people decide want do.

How poor decision? metaphor terrible implying giving people right choose masks, reopening businesses, social distance, etc. based comfortability equivalent physical action driving 120 directly endangering others. 

One giving personal freedom act, metaphor physical action stupid shit. clearly lol close

well, 30,000 person unmasked mass gathering put us little farther otherwise would been. 

But sort thing sane people hopefully look forward months goes well.  cant kill someone vote CDC data contradict U.K. Israeli data. It’s important look confidence intervals study. US study, 80% estimated efficacy, confidence interval 59%-90%: means study powerful enough rule efficacy values fall range. Agreed think ways this, businesses letting vaccinated people making unvaccinated people get tests, order incentivize discourage getting vaccinated. without compulsion still consequences choice. miss info ""verifying spread Covid others vaccinated""? keep info pretty well could missed/or seen radar. 

THIS data I'm waiting for. trip Mexico end May visit friends. little doubt cutting transmission, I'm hoping something solid share friends ahead visit. 

All 3 us traveling fully vaccinated. can’t even get wear masks, ermm, think vaccine passports nonstarter. Muh free dumb!!! one knows yet. like basis article people vaccinated 6 months, know lasts least 6 months. January February next year know yearly vaccine. can't ensure ""stays out"". countries taking proactive approach suppress it, article linked mentions, got control it, hotspots are, who's coming going country etc.

If taking testing seriously borders, trace isolate leap flair-ups contain them.

""zero-covid"" mean eradication. means suppressing level possible control it. significantly harder get citizenship vaccine o.p. seems meant actually acknowledging pain nation real meaningful way. what? Welcome Britain, use half metric half imperial still use fractions betting odds. That's weird thing say based absolutely nothing all. Please make jokes like this. [Here good actually create harm vaccine hesitancy. don’t get hybrid thing. go certain days week? get extra early days? would severely throw whole schedule. love wfh it’s nothing. Still silly host game like likely super spreader event since also outside.

You may want rethink that. outside probably little bearing whether become superspreader event.  Could production problems? seems like hitting good yields biological process problem general. smart watch sister's kids one jab Pfizer vaccine? convince conspiracy theorist get vaccine? known now, idiotic closings things like playgrounds beaches persisted. realize that's reality, staate recognize religiious freeedom, subsidizzing religiious choiice another issuue.

Depends field. some, outsourcing may issue, others, language barriers, time zones, reliable internet, sufficient experience prevent it.

It’s though companies didn’t remote work options pre-pandemic. thought going save money outsource things, wouldn’t done already? rare cases can, yes let’s generalize like everyone gets Covid gets symptoms. Classic fear mongering. probably never leave house you’re scared everything. fact remains, ***no idea*** OC's son tested covid many weeks might taken get results lab.

Saving 1 hours commute, sleeping 1 hour longer, spending less gas amazing. lot friends don’t feel lack social interaction, got vaccinated spend weekends together taking lunch times time time workdays, Im glad spend time family well, house pretty big office room don’t feel distracted something. may go back office Ill ask to, week. think remote work amazing never come back office full time basis. long last 2nd dose? Hybrid best me. still (personally) need non-family human interaction. past year real tough. changed goalposts get regular flu jab years ago. Medical advice changes. reality accepted based data. even sure point hear that. huge environmental monetary cost rat race. Hundreds dollars train fares, parking, gasoline, plus stress driving maintaining car, finding parking, missing trains, etc. Like others said, train ride unwinding, home well. one mentions lost time driving waiting train bus, obnoxious riders, cancelled schedules weather mechanical delays. Daily commuters deal this, factors surveys show huge numbers want hybrid full work home schedules. 15 hours week commuting top long work hours makes poor work life balance. Living closer work eases that, adds complexities higher housing costs kids school issues. Leaving good job city find balance option, always best one every case. Interesting.. I’m opposite. I’m way productive office enjoy going work. home find taking breaks lol US? Ireland virtually expectation would wear mask outdoors. Yep, I'm one them. I've jobs offer money caveat WFH refused. time valuable factor commute time it. current job going work 2 days month office perfectly fine me. *actually* work 8 hours instead hour work, mention saved wear tear car, gas, etc. also throw something oven let cool properly rather microwave turn terribly. also managers breathing neck.

All greatest part pandemic personally. Obviously everyone kind job wonderful me. Fair enough, higher. think it’s bit bizarre going using vaccine known odds side effect, mixing vaccines unknown odds side effects. information, willful ignorance got shot around time did, started feeling tired around 10pm, woke 3-4am low grade fever side effects Norway 1/25k died. Go heartbreak, stay beer. I'm definitely 34%, 10 minute commute. really hope hybrid schedules become reality. Working home = less drama, productivity, less human interaction. great things. Wow hell okay almost everyone take it, we're honest. risk miniscule. want another vaccine, think able request one. Well, shipments expected rise rapidly now. 1 million doses going local doctors week that's expected 4 million last week April. gotta pray nothing gets way shipments mutation immune vaccinations appears ^^ Personally can;t wait back in. bedroom office miserable still true. people want vaccinated get normal. Thats we're told guess part large minority, enjoy going office every day seeing peers, makes everything feel fulfilling IIRC French one bit failure there’s probably lots capacity kicking around produce vaccine.

It’ll also massively help uptake France it’s French-produced. There’s reason French car manufacturers stranglehold market there. chat people, whose connection share office 40 hours week you’ll never see hear leave job, one benefits me. AZ big part vaccination plan either. seem recall would amount couple weeks delay total. would much prefer hybrid given choice office home. I’d probably choose office life. downside wfh system allows mobility would allow eventually leave expensive city. 

Fingers crossed hybrid live less 5 cases covid..so wait lol referring public facing physicians loudest megaphones like Fauci, Walensky, Osterholm, et. 

In general, voices continue skirt around things like strong evidence vaccines reduce asymptomatic transmission use language like ""impending doom"" even though data almost universally signals quite optimistic trajectory pandemic coming months. 

I absolutely referring front line medical professionals nothing short heroes tirelessly working treat infected patients year now. Indeed, lot folks actually far optimistic months ahead public facing medical community is. Yeah, part get us back normal. There's nothing nervous about. Doubt true. true mainstream media would plasteree everywhere now.

Not first time government fucks importing health supply countries risk 30

This really *potential* risk. still proportion blood clots caused vaccination occured chance. data shown graphs assumes caused vaccine cautious.


The regulator still recvomends 30 get AZ vaccine alternative, benefits still likely outweigh risks. I'm sorry live world fear sensationalism - seriously. Must miserable.  I'd bet want full time remote work though. know certainly - human interaction important 2-3 days week office plenty We've seen impact various mutations Covid caused (UK, Brazil, S. Africa). big risk think might mutate way becomes deadly younger people (under 40's) priority moment vaccination? exactly did. already disappointed job, idea commuting back downtown almost making panic. fortunate find another job 2 weeks ago 100% remote, paying almost $13k/year more. quit, give jobs people suffering loosing businesses covid restrictions I'm glad good relationship co-workers. wish could work field actually looked forward seeing people it.  people stop this. problem old people, stop using administrated az vaccines. problem young people, especially women. right here. It’s always cheaper company provide lunches mixers yoga give Friday afternoons off. haven’t worn pants long time. read immediate symptoms zero bearing health problems referenced affect people age. Even affects asymptomatics. Seconded. Yeah December freaking INFERNO LA covid true, add couple things:

1) EMA can't impose age restrictions EU, national health agencies possible converge common solution next hours / days.

2) vaccine available, makes sense give high-risk patients benefits much greater risks.

3) EMA straightforward beginning quite open. Even last conference said might associated AZ vaccine journalists know communicate scientific data.

4) Realistically hard sell young people better alternatives available (both safety efficacy wise). one never go back people. started going back month ago hasn’t bad. miss hour sleep commute still suck also enjoy office versus seeing actual human several days time. grass always greener. even get Homeoffice beeing ugly.

Um.....I say ""ugly"" yeah, folks home offices less pressure ""look part."" example Crohns Disease, sucks fuckton

Bummer. everyone real choice comes health kids

No shit, thank lucky stars I'm healthy, can't kids. say may ugly disrespectfull chose work home.

You're choosing least charitable interpretation words possible. No, point we're remote, perhaps folks encounter less discrimination, could also totally wrong it.  want go two days week - one day go lunch everyone day go happy hour 😂 wouldn’t “rather.” I’m calling bullshit. long last you? things harm good, unlike going movie theatre. Serbian entity Bosnia Herzegovina get Sputnik V doses? Something like 100,000 doses more. case, Serbia offering neighbours well, matter much Bosnians doses. seems overwhelming consensus. People realized save money commuting work, less stressful, comfortable, much work home, would go back?

Its mostly control. Bosses want asses seats want able closely monitor activity. announcement MHRA seemed pretty smart me.

where low rate covid community, worth waiting different vaccine.

As rate covid increases balance tips favour taking it.

right now, UK okay spot. countries less so.


saying blood clotting incidents past take another one good hear. supposed get many doses, AZ delivered anywhere near that. think little 200.000 doses stock currently. People want see biases reinforced. facts go them, facts bad. CNN soft-balled this. eye opener Google COVID OUTBREAKS SCHOOLS. goes page page. current Michigan crisis said based largely school reopenings particular school sports. You’re going get turned away. /r/covid19positive ....but yea.... Lol. work medical research involved several COVID-19 trials. work full time home (and done since pandemic). Many coworkers well, since pandemic company broadened WFM policies. ‘essential’ way people warped word past year, I’d argue people would concede clinical trials fact essential. 

There plenty jobs done remotely essential society. started remotely really care met coworkers. They're coworkers, friends family. I'm tired pretending care would anyway grab beers work. I'm practically zombie first two hours day, whole office wants chit-chat whole damn time. **have to** 8am... what? Baby Boomers charge see we're here... working. college classes Loving Hybrid schedule. office 2-3x week. home rest. Classic 8-5 office job. employees show productive seems like brainer. Same. One favorite coworker friends lived across world me, even left job we’re still buds text every weeks. said, definitely takes certain type person, won’t like everyone. Good. That's I'll doing. know still living apt, would probably wished back work now. house yard makes difference. Vaccination lot widespread NFL season. We'll see. Texas Rangers home opener looking good. They're fatal they're inherently life threatening long-term harm. showing serious hospitalizations. society, rather government, able successfully force companies keep patrons safe mean everything working exactly intended: freedoms preserved, people stay safe, anti-vaxx morons mad. Literally everyone wins! UK testing it. get results June.  mean considering studies show people high levels narcissism less likely wear masks, I'd say narcissism. Remember high narcissistic traits gives strong belief exceptionalism. think people believe they're stronger, better, smarter. inconceivable beat virus, even lot clearly underlying conditions put risk. 

That's kept hearing ""if scared, stay home."" though normal response scared brand new, deadly virus somehow unwarranted. alone tells narcissism play there. saw braver average person. may full blown NPD probably higher normal narcissism without full blown disorder.

That's also lot get vaccine. much faith ability science. want glimpse that, peek anti-vaxx group right now. ""I fight better vaccine building immune system."" people like that, ego entire world. former job start scheduling extra meetings WFH crew.

Why? would email us (lab based science) need answers right away, would email they'd take forever get back us. tell us meeting they'd later. spoke HR C levels told incredibly busy drop everything respond email, WFH people responsive needed things.

Turns out, CEO decided errands day spotted 3 co-workers hanging mall shopping. snapped pic sent HR deal end month. week later, went gym check new piece equipment wanted home gym, sees 2 co-workers gym mid-day.

So tons random ass meetings WFH group response this, since lab-based employees busting asses 50 hours week hit deadlines people slacked constantly, commute either. also program make sure they're actually using computers.

And yes. CEO randomly run errands workday, also easily worked 70+ hour weeks flying constantly meet investors partners. Working weird hours West Coast East Coast offices, partners Europe Japan.

 Yes, lab based employees working 50+ hour weeks hit deadlines, got paid handsomely. WFH group always caused faults even offices. 

The CEO absolutely fantastic fair everything. Probably least strict possible care level at, he'd chat ask actual questions life science. Even interns. 

He pissed tried extra nice started taking advantage it. Makes sense at-risk prioritized vaccines. Hopefully we’re moving general population see cases start go too. say! UK banks worst, pre pandemic physically go bank cash cheque took 3-4 days come account.

Now due pandemic, simply scan cheque app phone receive money within 24 hours. 

Like... could done years ago? early 2000’s train wreck.  Companies spent millions undoing one. 

That mistake won’t made company memory.  doubt could find single person would get vaccinated there's free beer it. *Maybe* find couple motivated get sooner otherwise would. anyone who's hardcore getting vaccinated Sam Adams. publicity stunts, nothing more. Well case numbers started going 3 weeks ago, you’d think would seeing deaths right (I think average, patients fatal cases die 2 weeks symptoms start) Pfizer sold Israel, IIRC, there’s ton data it. vaccines administered ordered last year, US boycotted Covax. money pledged get vaccines next year order books full. Anyways, per capita base, Germany donates lot US. country? 1 day me. everything need home. one day week thing would certain meetings would better held person keep contact manager such, yeah can’t ever see going back old way. Amazing flip it? UK restricts EMA allows it. wonder make new conspiracy theories based totally fine time UK restricting it. I’m 312 well. 

I think you’ll see lot converted living space leases don’t stay filled. 

You’ll see companies drool lower lease prices try buy entire floors get people back well. Sorry, clarified.. province BC 70+ age based roll out.. 55-65 get astra Zeneca. course indigenous communities small remote communities getting vaccinated. guess I’m mostly focused age based roll I’m younger 55.  really liked comment agree almost it. problem facets employment governed rest org HR can’t change, also things change cost (time effort, petty politics) high hard wade bureaucracy.

And typing makes wonder stick around....... UK running medical trial testing it. Germany considering going ahead anyway. Early termination contracts usually comes pretty hefty fee and, often, commercial real estate signed single-year deals like might renting apartment.

If renewing means paying 6 years cost 20 million dollars terminate contract early, neither options really seems good. Middle managers tend control freaks want see butts chairs micromanage them. get lot done way less time WFH full-time, without meaningless water cooler talk, forced team lunches want decompress workload, crazy commute times/expenses. I’m never going back in-person work. Must long 10 years without high speed internet then! link talks recent discoveries China made cardiology. talks nothing discoveries made Han Dynasty. 

What’s wrong saying China ultimately wants become world super power like US currently is. Many major players world fighting spot. China currently biggest player regard. US built many military bases around world definitely seen way hold power world. China currently along lines. Offering poor countries funding resources build infrastructure ultimately China 99 year contract runs cause way developing nations afford pay money back. Oooo yeah looked fabulous Yeah, mean think way overkill anyway, family member still going fully vaccinated. point, ever stopping?  post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Haha first one almost made mistake husband!! I'm boat, miss Netflix. 

I get amount work done now, home, I'm bored ass without Netflix playing background working various shows movies time watch decades. Simply throwing money issue solve it. 

seems turn 1.2 billion dollars 300 million doses vaccine.. that's definitely help solve problem.

&amp;#x200B;

the US spent money MAY 2020.

on vaccines usable US right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**U.S. secures 300 million doses potential AstraZeneca COVID-19 (Reuters) - United States secured almost third first 1 billion doses planned AstraZeneca’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine pledging $1.2 billion, world powers scramble medicines get economies back care poor countries getting vaccines? share them. 

**U.S. share 4 million doses AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine Mexico,  one say ""iT's fLu, BrOh"" Portuguese? post locked due constant Rule 1 violations. get half quality quarter price that's going look like good deal many industries. authorize AZ probably set precedent rest world. I'm sure waiting fully vaccinated population Pfizer, Moderna, JJ, authorize donate doses globally. AZ still good things world figure age/sex effected clotting issue. It’s year, TON lease renewals come renegotiated killed. 

CFOs going see absurd savings massive downtown office jump chance kill leases. article states clearly dead individuals young healthy, seems due underlying condition working home see buddies also working home start discord channel them. I'd hands rather talk actual friends anyone places I've worked throughout life.  husband switched jobs last summer ended working company started branch city COVID hit. don’t physical office go into, parent company announced finding office space team isn’t roadmap 2021 2022. So...IF husband goes back office won’t 2023. daughter thrilled. husband mostly happy, hoping he’d able meet new coworkers point year. God forbid socializing🙄 Talking people water fountain times day loafing around basements day Micro-management.... aren’t EUA vaccines We’re going get exposed SARS-CoV-2 exposed spike proteins anyway. Might well use non replicating ones prime immune systems future encounters. going hide basement rest life hiding spike protein? still appears provide fantastic protection important things -- hospitalization death. big problem whether people get sniffles day two, problem get severely sick die. regard, J&amp;J vaccine still fantastic vaccine.

Congratulations!!! Oh yeah boss hates working home is, joke,the 1 office year now! hates home, around wife kids.. Sam Adams already gives free beer free brewery tours. 

Its promote brand test new products. Congrats good luck! They’re age area really stupid. chronic condition makes risk don’t count that. Original SARS easy fever common symptom makes hosts sick fast. Temperature screening effective mask mandates needed countries outbreaks controlled within months.

Covid-19 different many spreaders infectious without fever. countries controlled well imposed mask mandates addition containment measures ((China, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macau, etc). 34%? Plus decide bright lights set temperature. awesome. Time look job gives want. Oh man, don’t miss anything working office. never understand this. seems waiting lines lot places, lot Reddit already saying everyone know vaccinated. how? US given 110 million first doses. would assume 85% adults want vaccine, means half way point willing adults. demand issues already. (urban) places US difficult come appointment.

Is vaccine hesitancy high? clearly supply vaccines vaccination capacity. must people showing up, right? incompetent 65, home bound 65, uninformed computer illiterate 65? State rolling vans homebound every State going pro-active.

If everyone opportunity get vaccine, we'll around 70% population effectively herd immunity.  Totally, stopped get gas every week, car insurance went down, don’t feel pressured get lunch out, top extra two hours get everyday. I’ll never go back avoid it. years WFH belt, think always option whenever feasible. 

But field I'm going (instructional design), going office advantages. 

I like nailing ideas person people. also like getting dressed up, eating healthy food, actually feet interacting people day. makes ""coming home"" really mean something. 

I used think introvert, ways am, point think like going little WFH.

Commuting suck though. sounds like get social interaction work. 

That’s healthy. shop Covid I’m wfh odds ends work online. Normally I’d Uni I’m parents place middle nowhere lowest age 40. that’s case, things much worse Michigan rest U.S.? wore zip-up hoodie tank top, could shrug one arm hoodie. husband wore pullover sleeves tight roll up, take shirt off. think one, lol! got appt. J&amp;J shot people telling it’s “worst” one there. It’s still effective others right ? guys still working home? went back office full time June. worked home month! opposite, small company lots crunch time. would come office, sit 10 hours listening headphones one leave again, often without talking single person... Rather home then. Lol you’re one moving goal posts. first post assumed everyone currently vaccinated. second post assumed 2 months everyone would vaccinated. this, third post, argument “okay, fine, everyone’s going vaccinated kids unlikely serious consequences getting it, don’t count.” guess depends industry available options. 20 years like half career probably cancel vaccine appointment Sunday then. introvert feel like take exact opposite experience.

Working office forces get social interaction that, despite often tell myself, really need. nobody making go social, zero chance going it. problematic like humans, introverts require socialization, different amount pace it. Working home especially difficult situation sit home day grind away work realize days since said word anyone outside immediate family. many times seen exact story? month later record deaths. Here's hoping elderly vaccinated premature headline best option people would office all. shows point companies large office space accommodate employees. left job allowed work home join company different industry, hoping industry change would open doors me. new job requires work person, knew took job, I’ve 6 months since requested work home two separate occasions car issues. (I work social media marketing easily everyday job comfort home.) informed CEO like folks WFH company cracking WFH due “abuse” - needless say I’m looking new job. guess simply reinforce idea people travelling pandemic.

Sure, vaccinated people likely fine hurt, jackasses vaccinated see people travelling try slip through.

Just guess. person smart. People morons. still havent counted 20m j&amp;j doses March what's point delivering March CDC doenst allocate middle april. team fairly small prior Covid, making progress promoting working home 50% time (hybrid). transition easy based feedback provided team. 90% tools cloud based ha e dependency enterprise network. 

What dislike members department bullies comes promoting office. Ive asked business justification answer received want office.

No job description job requirements imply need office someones satisfaction self care. 

I fully support hybrid schedule try sell need office there, issue that. Worth noting chart based low COVID circulation. COVID UK, risk hospitalised COVID would higher hospitalised AZ jab people 20s. ""Have friends."" 😭 like diseases weak people.

Or....the conventionally unattractive. thread made realize might real boon folks. First 100% hybrid. Agreed counts, EU messaging AZ vaccine bad, oh doesn’t cause blood clots well maybe it’s safe except definitely causes blood clots. 
 
And yes, since we’re close outright leading world comes vaccinations, instead adding fourth shot bad press arsenal could lot good sending neighbors rather sit storage. EMA MHRA gave recommendation treat women differently, based data available.

This could healthcare workers prioritised vaccination, healthcare workers women (and could correlation rollout plan physiological). Yep, left one yesterday thousands upvotes saying ema found link hadn't, clarified hadn't. eventually took reported false dangerous, damage done nonetheless. many women take birth control, carries risk blood clots. (In fact, risk BC around 100 times vaccine)

So, given it’s made clear clotting observed AZ recipients studies yet attempted control factors population, it’s likely we’re seeing already well known rates caused BC. allows get little household chores done I'm working evenings weekends.... Laundry, vacuuming, cleaning kitchen, etc. 

Bam. excellent kitchen five second walk away workstation. hope never work office again. J&amp;J supposed deliver 450K vaccines April Denmark, ended cut 43k, close reliability Pfizer. It’s possible intelligently design sample 800 represent entire population. It’s hard, possible. Without reading methodology study don’t know.

But assume sample 800 accurate representation whole country, it’s fact uncertainty poll &lt;2%. That’s statistics 101. April summer India 1st dose. confirm. office told we'd going back September, two interviews different jobs today! Wish luck! Spend time 1:1s talking personal stuff rather work build relationships. I've worked years people I've never met person great relationships them. Man way communicate someone without needing see face face IRL There's none.

It never tested. least specifically talking covid vaccines.

Sounds like weird decision people risk avoidant point refusing take 1 250 000 chance. made valid points conclusion ridiculous. Based what? aren’t even wearing mask JOB handle food people see you, care pandemic masks, that’s going translate personal life. data come largely dispelled notion vaccines protect symptomatic illness, there's still chance getting infected, infections asymptomatic, spread infection another person. 

A ~90% reduction chance getting infected effective, however there's also strong chance exposure (cases remain high many parts US) odds vaccinated person infected still significant enough careful around unvaccinated people high risk.

Once vaccines widespread enough drive cases insignificant would longer real need worry someone vaccinated high risk not. First, said data really yet say sure 2nd 2nd doses lower 1st time. **megakaryocyte** large bone marrow cell lobated nucleus responsible production blood thrombocytes (platelets), necessary normal blood clotting. Many older people still remember diseases vaccinate controlled. remember grandma telling one would vaccines they'd seen diseases really do. Time zones, taxes, regulations, etc. part, outsourcing office work really make sense. stuff like on-call work manufacturing make sense outsource, since really care time zones. free market apostles. waiting waiting choice public pressure intervene make sure AZ met obligations. claiming son earliest confirmed case Arizona

No aren't. ARE. date tested positive would date recorded state database positive. assuming must tested ***and gotten results*** day admitted arguing baseline, ***which huge presumption part***.

Using argument testing readily available time, realistically could've taken weeks get results, regardless date admitted and/or tested. 25f here, live Canada still wait another vaccine option others available decide lift recommendation give AZ 55 years age. would different vaccine available, options risk dying COVID probably lower taking vaccine itself..  Someone credible? Docs here. care, hey, body us dug decisions. end, conscience. need know cower face much negativity. part care get shots point. I've saved **10 hours week** commuting. went office zero tolerance policy work home 100% work home. I'm happy go office times week, thought going back 100% office work feels unbearable. can't put genie back bottle. 

If nothing else, allow people choose. 50% coworkers want hybrid option, remaining half split 100% WFH 100% in-office. see harm allowing people work way work best. companies APPEARANCE office. think makes look better. office NYC one brand new large buildings millions dollars probably spent on. I'm certain they'll hybrid schedule little bit eventually everyone back office can't let millions dollars go waste. quite amusing reading posts people claim everyone working home pandemic eases life know change.... Guaranteed people back office sooner rather later.. might job. yeah death count kind thing gonna obviously muddled cancer uptick. Also primary concern land cant used generations depressing though. Everyone claiming 'listen science' government listening science. 

People know virus hit people disproportionate way. encourage brigading users. I’m you. love cruises first vaccine dose (second two weeks) won’t go long wear mask deal distancing testing. vaccine proof enough certain point.

I feel kids colleges vaccinated (which reasonable) still required wear masks, submit testing, otherwise normal campus life. would temporary measure COVID-19 gets essentially eradicated population immunised? expanded? I'm genuinely interested know. can't get work done unless human interactions working? like current schedule alternate going office. one week I'll go in, next week I'll work home. sometimes 2 days home, 3 days office week. role think Testing, Case Investigation Contact Tracing play people want get vaccinated able to? encourage brigading subs users.

Got push back, important actually reach people, do, connection had. agree Vincent Racaniello variants super strains overhyped ""messed narrative""? agree worried virus going out-evolve vaccines? much media hype raise fear attention clicks eyeballs? data much anecdotal point hoping true. also hoping find vaccinated people catch COVID it’s nasal passage infection doesn’t reach rest body. early studies finding 89% sterilizing efficacy encouraging front. data becomes clearer readjust risk tolerances behavior. wouldn’t go indoor restaurant today, I’m hoping enough data fall indicate safety. Also people don’t like drive / older confident driving. Also time spent traffic/ money paid gasoline maintenance toll roads. difference can't see body language coworkers

In experience, lot workplace conflicts come misunderstandings. seeing coworkers' body language makes communication difficult = misunderstandings. person's remark joke, sarcasm, insult? think important technical field almost field. also difficult multiple small discussions time, micro break everyone casually talks person next really possible share zoom call (or requires administration deliberately breaking smaller zoom rooms). virtual coffee break really larger group, reason. Somebody suddenly getting new symptom months later probably needs psych consult. Yeah, great consensus. want study works, join climate hysteria. see consensus, among people even scientists, figure make data fit consensus. visit Sweden. Consensus keyword pull meeting decisions take forever. even come discussion everything must studied years unless pseudo-religious (like climate), oppressive line wins. would fire tell harden up. Working home unproductive people people think it’s appropriate separate work personal lives. It’s also bad city centres less people would spending money there

Enough ‘new normal’ rubbish; must return old normal, better worse. blood clot developing first dose second dose? got mine toooooooooooo Hi Dr. Frieden - think international health community need successfully scale vaccine distribution globally potentially impact ongoing efforts health areas? Thanks! home town Lebach, Saarland Germany first Germany 24/7 vaccination point, run army, since 2 days ago.

FIRST GERMANY 🤦🏼‍♂️ People languishing home alone without partner, family, support system. I’d rather quit forced stay home full time too! generally less active men disparity genders exercise participation exacerbates gender inequality health.

Wait, world sentence? extent there's ""gender inequality"" health, men live shorter lives.  I’ve also heard SF’s alcohol license board interested preventing new bars restaurants opening anything else (well, covid). number night places dwindling. Meanwhile Boston still date bars reopen all. seems lot ugliness lurking beneath surface liberal places. Norway considering whether vaccinate people 65 scrapping vaccine good. zero chance use without age restrictions. good move UK regulator, graphs data presented comes risks benefits AZ vaccine show risk 30 (at current COVID incidence rates) greater prevents makes sense offer alternative vaccine available.

Hopefully knock vaccine confidence younger people. would kill actual interactions people office.

As someone worked remotely whole career (which launched early 40's)......trust me, getting together colleagues less regular basis almost better normal interactions office, intense. 

But yeah, established better know coworkers, even brief ""summits"" meetings, better. Damn, that’s almost perfect distribution curve. 25 50 25 basically zero side effects first second dose Moderna. little achey next day hours.

Republicans say would get vaccinated *sources trust* said safe necessary.

Apparently none ""sources"" are, like, medical professionals. Still, it’s extremely low chance individual level. chance reduced offering certain groups different vaccine, I’m it. condescension post, gave us terrible analogy. Dressing wound prevent body functioning normally, even inconvenient. harsher lockdown is, disrupts society; main reason people find following long time hard governments seem prefer relatively light restrictions. Love see it. Even couple months ago, still worried public sentiment going preclude returning anything remotely normal 2021, looks like people upset things like live sporting events plain losing. absence scientific consensus still must make decisions attempt operate society. Black white available us hindsight must live gray knowing whats possible/likely virus vaccines we've produced. far effective variants otherwise shown operate rules accordingly. No? get concerns time, zero risk approach would hard execute would leave society panic mode years, minimal benefit.

At point, would hope vulnerable would take individual action protect believe they’re still at-risk getting post-vaccine. wouldn’t ever want go back office. 

Commuting takes sooooo much time life, can’t imagine anyone would miss sitting traffic 20+ minutes way. 

Not mention statistically it’s riskiest thing you’ll days.

All time saves morning get extra sleep, bond animals more, it’s lot less stressful log work breakfast scarf muffin putting pants heading out. 

On breaks I’d rather relax couch, walk dog, enjoy sights outside knowing it’s short walk back computer rather drive back office walk / take elevator 7th floor again.

Not mention allows time care live someone else. even then, breaks take care laundry dishes doesn’t pile get home end day.

I hope office never goes back do, we’re given choice go back office keep working home. answering question dude, chill scared covid, stay home. Instead forcing bullshit vaccine passports onto others. Additionallly essentially implied higher number cases women could related specifics rollout, presume relates fact healthcare workers women, healthcare workers prioritised (quote rightly). Covid 19 became new flu, year new strains vaccinations?  Outdoor Dining banned Ireland!

Lots outdoor activity currently banned ireland. good treatments, including simple things like oxygen prone positioning steroids. complicated treatments also look quite promising, including monoclonal antibodies medications. Many already available. biggest thing horizon called direct-acting antivirals, don’t think timeline this, lots effort put trying develop them. Ideally, would oral, highly effective, useful prophylaxis exposure treatment someone ill. Stay tuned, vaccinate meantime! Totally agree, keep mind peer reviewed journal common people past infections stronger symptomatic response. body already alert COVID vaccine basically sent signal back. symptoms experiencing body's immune response aggressively trying get rid perceived infection.

There's [a couple suggest people past infections may need one dose mRNA vaccine, though may awhile that's officially recommended. 

You'll also see report ""those pre-existing immunity experienced systemic side effects fatigue, headache, chills, fever, muscle joint pains considerably higher frequency"" ""people previously covid-19 reported side effects frequently first dose."" Ironically, like office. 

How ironic thread people who'd rather quit go office? Okay, whatever man, sounds like determined hate whole nationality regardless.

I think actually makes *you* pretty close type Brit talking about. mean, seems like point article kid develops set symptoms, parents doctors aware could MIS-C, even child known covid symptoms. seems like reasonable thing tell people they’re aware case child starts showing symptoms. didn’t read article “keep kids inside get this!” guess YMMV. demographics Chile vaccinations probably different. vaccines lot less effective elderly people young/healthy ones. shot get? Right? That's take well. get social interaction walking dog park, going happy hours wife, sweating 11pm every night sleep 8 every morning instead 6. I'll take small talk around coffee machine coworkers every single time. Here’s link 15 Reddit threads hundreds women discussing it’s affected period. Sex hormones strongly connected immune system, especially estrogen. Women tend stronger immune responses general, it’s surprise vaccine response include menstruation disruption. Even menopausal women menstruated years experiencing bleeding cramps vaccination. first shot Pfizer tomorrow. I’m curious see happens cycle. One silver lining getting laid job... pay monthly parking, let alone parking rarely used covid pay keep since move equipment sometimes. ""We could waited 2 months""

Why sound oddly familiar?

""Just 2 weeks bro""

OH yeah.... IF

He say team work gotten worse 1000 deaths 30 million (caused virus) day not.

Not younger age groups... UK 1000 deaths day right lmao. average overall death rate factor age. actually watched presentation proving statistical illiteracy, seen directly compared threat virus younger age groups vs threat vaccine surprisingly similar, point actual decision make young people, hence they've added restrictions.  
 
Or MHRA statistically illiterate compared well? likelihood one person bringing in, takes.

Well, no. That's ""all takes."" also spread another person. 

As ""sheer numbers,"" nope, buying CFA employs 40% fast food workers state whole exchange started blaming Chick-fil-a employing maskless jesus freaks.

""Blame"" accurate word all. ""Explain"" ""understand"" CFA outbreaks accurate people won’t even that, also quarantining staying away friends/family social events.

You say that. CFA ~40% outbreaks. something give likely lack social distancing I'm store, wonder another explanation. Canada far less people vaccinate progress rapid. far far far far far less deaths hospitalizations livelihoods families completely destroyed. mention close zero medical bankruptcies. I'd much happier Canadian. think makes sense mandate occasional get together person connections, yeah society whole would lot better people worked home vast majority time possible. Nice. Good luck That's 100% problem though. inability self-regulate result us *can* forced commute back in. absolutely shocking length right wing authoritarians go protect ego ever admitting mistake. Hybrid still save right, essentially double amount employees per building. Aww, come on, remember shopping ebay used cool. counterintuitive, money same. People come earlier. getting drunk issues usually 12-2. I'm getting sleep stopped drinking myself. work life lot better past year, I'm aware I'm minority this, especially foodservice. recognize economic need bars reopen operate normal hours, hate it. allowed take masks off? get compensation that. didn’t much like last job people deal get compensation travel expenses. company wife works Baltimore pays parking. know, right?!

Weed good, shouldn’t use drugs interview actually work writing. I’m still sighted enough use normal computer monitor, use inverted colors enlarge cursors/pointers, stuff like that. blind drive, means commute ends four times long needs be. realise presenting data scientists politicians. literally nothing gain want save lives. There’s big difference saying there’s causal link saying there’s *proven* causal link. second authorities AstraZeneca saying, truth. Although growing evidence clots caused vaccine, long time wasn’t, still isn’t, clear causal link probably accounting coffee break, snacks consumables sure.

that’s like 90% monthly wage working part time lmfao someone lives cars people freight trains... hell train parking pass? “Look new job” “quit” different things, clickbait title. Nothing content article though, absolutely think findings valid. U.K. call “Kent variant”. mask mandate? It'd reduce spread, would outdoors, people within close proximity other.

You could call fanciful paranoia, and/or reassure debate partner would temporary measure end pandemic. separate points merits. scope creep real devil unreasonable want get front it. Peer reviewed studies take months years publish. It’s amazing we’re getting many fact checked print quickly. use natural immunity want. He’s talking people demand others wear masks stay home might vaccinated. Natural immunity counts. Said like true American!!! me??? Well, shouldn’t care takes someone else get shot, care masses, god hard understand?? See mean, can't that, contracts, 1 location telework, get trouble anywhere else.  Yeah got 30 minute meetings, even leave house. guess I'm assuming everyone 30 minute meetings every day, standard daily meetings consequential.

I'm talking _meeting days_. got 4.5 hours worth meetings different teams, sprint reviews, business sponsors, etc get done point week - get scheduled one two days cram together sequentially.

THOSE days back office. days forcing everyone room gets shit done. Seems like one getting news ""media headlines"" - rest us actually reading article. Assuming 5 day workweek, spending $20-25 day commuting? commuting 100 miles way something? Individual subreddits mean nothing. That's like saying women vapid, gold digging narcissists pointing /Femaledatingstrategy back up.

The option work want work, simple Likely immune mediated different type reaction. Anaphylaxis certain antibody (igE) histamines released mast cells whereas think theory behind one would different types antibodies attacking platelets causing 'immune mediated thrombocytopenia' whatever reason cerebral venous clots. 
This opinion please take pinch salt im sure official sources give info time. 1. Paid sick leave. really important Covid, flu, diseases. important policy.
2. Better public health systems global, national, state, city, local levels.
3. Better primary health care systems.

I wrote question everyday life. think biggest change may mask wearing, particularly indoors, time may feeling ill, people health problems. like now, like before. like East Asia, mask wearing considered normal. mandatory future, useful avoid flu potentially serious infections. feel like every one articles theme people gaining weight pandemic always seems barrage responders say lost weight.  prefer office. get done. company, numbers show remote employees getting less done office employees, little different hear Reddit though. Maybe us. trying leave current job, every job applied 100% remote. Hahahha that’s lie. boarded gig year ago also 100% remote. Fortunately it’s first rodeo worked remote U.K. US company back. worked me:
Use video conf rather audio dial wherever possible get know people mannerisms non verbal cues. 
When someone starts IM email conversation switch call (or preferably video call) whenever can. It’s efficient time talk rather type lot cases.
Have regular time set aside talk colleagues without specific work agenda - like “how weekend” call. That’s get benefit stuff would normally get water cooler etc. 

Hope helps. Leronlimab #cydy 

Saves lives like other.... like facebook posts saying dont want private companies know health information proceed post vaccine selfie. at-home person might need car day Seriously, there's zero logic behind beyond demonstrating control peoples lives

If someone happier gets work done home let &amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

they mix vaccines..

there's evidence mix produces robust response.

so they're going test covid United Kingdom launched study mix match two COVID-19 vaccines bid ease daunting logistics immunizing millions people — potentially boost immune responses process.

&amp;#x200B;

Could mixing COVID vaccines boost immune developers often combine two vaccines combat pathogen,*** researchers keen deploy strategy — known heterologous prime-boost — coronavirus. heterologous prime-boost combination approved last year European regulators protect **Ebola, experimental HIV vaccines often rely strategy,** says Dan Barouch, director Center Virology Vaccine Research Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston, Massachusetts. yet tested vaccines COVID-19, typically given repeat injection vaccine. I'm good luv enjoy agree. many cases people need set boundaries feel obligated respond texts emails outside working hours. Otherwise they're implying they're always available issue continue. Literal psychopaths Yes, Denmark Norway made similar decisions throughout pandemic. Perhaps let Swedes try first make decision ;)  Berlin Airport WW scandal already showed utterly corrupt incompetent Germans be. Herd immunity impossible. 

This virus spread infect rest life. 

So mind, right time? happen point. point isn’t herd immunity exists never. I'm getting fucking tired ""No true scotsman"" falacy comes lockdowns.

There almost examples strict lockdowns, pie sky countries, **stop advocating STRICT lockdowns**, HAPPEN. 


mockdowns usless Thank posting sources!  three different interviews going freelance. 2 work home forever. I'm trying convince third, best job, let work home. fair, ""screaming"" adjective I'd use baseball fans 34% gonna get fired then. jobs work well remote, done pandemic. 

Personally think hybrid way go many office jobs seems bit silly full stay home orders people vaccinated natural immunity. people allowed work spend money least keep economy limping along? Maybe spikes causing socially distanced fans outdoor sporting events?

PS: need 8 distance almost-safety nobody may touch anything. definitely cannot end precautions now!!! [ain’t ‘til it’s it’s definitely over. summer we’ll getting toward new normal, and, variants don’t disrupt control, fall we’ll new normal. new normal may include masks, careful certain circumstances learn effective vaccines long term, among elderly vulnerable.

I think it’s unlikely long term adverse effects vaccines. Basically, teach immune system find fight covid, disappear. don’t change you, give system instructions needs stay safe Covid. And, even long-term effective, think unlikely, would FAR lower risk risk short- long-terms harms Covid infection itself. Yes fucking do. Click hospitalizations here: notice ""Number COVID-19 Cases Hospitalized **Date Hospitalization**"" 0 January 15, 2020. Nobody hospitalized january 15 2020 state arizona confirmed positive covid case. good idea OP's son tested. truly hospitalized January 15, 2020 never tested positive COVID-19 quit. 

I don’t get people throwing hissy fit. want work home find job hiring that. Thank you. Thank hard work public health. boarded remote dev job otherwise would onsite love little INTERACTION coworkers. wake list tasks complete noon cup coffee. It’s best. I'd scared pandemic end repulsive pessimistic attitude Thanks response continued work advocating public health! AZ seems failed deliver EU week (we received half doses Poland). related? Curious, really huge pay difference states us? (im swedish) take breaks home still get way done. Fewer hours productivity I'm stuck distracting office could always done time frame, quit job market basket. Instead everyone else paid stay home. Self respect driven work. new varients contagious could possibly deadly. kids, guess parents want risk kids lives, stop them. it. What.... covid dies go meet people fun places again

Wfh covid wfh general  saying be. context crowds sporting events banned Ireland duration pandemic. result won’t tell anything one way other. 

IIRC max allowed sporting event went 50 one stage height it. Ever watch R rated movie? Thanks reply! found challanging fight misinformation takes someone 5 seconds spread whereas takes 15 minutes refute it. find exchanges achievable online, much effective person? vaccinations available.

They available. Germany, EU. I'm you. 100% WFH me. couple days week, maybe. I'm honest, know I'm nearly productive office. Plus miss socialization aspect too. reality workers called back office want to, someone waiting take job. left office work laid start pandemic never talk another bloviating self important business boomer it'll lifetime late. really seems like every office two three people work six people fuck around day planning mandatory fun.

Office work bad people.  want stay home stay home don’t drag others you. we're already ""show papers"" society, great, good know, thank you. companies recognised benefits beyond simple capital annual expenditure savings permanent office space, seen unexpected marked upturn productivity, yet necessity flexibility.

Many though, still succumb reverting middle-management- (and consequently micro-management-) heavy states haul staff back in.

Where two organization types direct competition, inevitable latter price business.

I shall watch interest. good! Get er done!  Ironically, free time radicalized 30-hour week issue. much time get wasted zoning out, 8 hours work much fully used productively. 

I work weeks beginning pandemic employer kinda panicked bit (I work online store store still widely recognized brick mortar), whole bread making frenzy made much sense. We're willing pay convenience pre-made food whole host services already little free time enjoy ourselves. needlessly so, could work 8 boring hours 6 5 focused hours.

We literally 8 hours shifts industrial revolution, factories ran 24/7 machines huge bummer shut down. 2 12-hour shifts day worker rights activists managed get 3 8-hour shifts. There's reason office worker schedule based that. There's scientific basis productivity standpoint. Nice big quiet office.

Most us barely office space 5 people always distracting easy procrastinating

Definition office.

My room bigger I'm WFH solo room we've 5 people, PC 2-3 monitors. Imagine smell temperature. worry, I'm sure able find job post covid forces office 37.1% Texans vaccinated first dose. 8 million people. wish hadn’t done least set mobile vaccination site stadium. Seems like waste good opportunity. get either. One side effect losing sense smell/taste. want shit? Fuck no. Even conspiracy theories true, I'll take microchip means immunity losing smell day week Would interesting suss little further. know company would require office 100% point, we'll probably see ""encouraging"" BS. I'm getting ""encouragement"" people back more, I'm telling team minimum keep flexibility, since we're formally back office yet seen play (i.e. 1 day week WFH?), coming. really want lose team members, hard find talent right there's lot evidence outdoor transmission negligible compared indoor settings. Also, vulnerable people vaccinated total number cases matter much. Everyone stadium could get covid vulnerable (65+, major pre-existing conditions) vaccinated die. bitching vaccine passports living ""show papers"" society - work major hotel, operated one world's largest hotel chains. allowed enter facility subcontractor, get screened, take self-assessment wear bright orange wristband says, ""Screened Ready Work"". would allowed on-site without wristband. It’s known fact virus isn’t deadly towards kids. big fear kids picking virus giving parents grandparents. 

So parents grandparents vaccinated still need masks. guys moving goal posts yet again? serbia purchased vaccines can, however, replace lower cost workers smaller domestic markets fraction expense. free colorado things like indoor dining reduced capacity, governor want another stay home order even around thanksgiving/christmas things got worse. quit can't return work. hate home office. job home office friendly (software developer), miss going work much. like home relax free time, workplace work. feels like always work.. We’ve seen virus mutate, first Italy UK Brazil South Africa. think covid19 could’ve around humanity long time low levels mutated Wuhan someone compromised immune. Exactly! Also read vaccination shifts 3 5 th evening. Hence able use left-over shots single vial throw away end day since next day useless. Trump, Covid getting better.

Let people want work office work office, let people want work home work home. Let people want hybrid system hybrid system. 

The companies probably get smaller offices since ~50% people want WFH full time.  We’ll see august it’s 115 Valley transmission negligible Fluids rest.

You already actual, IRL definition right front you; it’s linked upthread. There’s nothing merit left argue. Well nobody texas learned single lesson 2011 expect given statements nobody learned anything February Well shit. choice return get paid quit scourge food rent money. I'd love quit job. also like able make mortgage car payments without worrying them. It’s never widespread it’s always issue. people caring it’s hitting families didn’t give crap people’s problems.

Let's forget people needed ALOT less money live go things. easy say would rather quit gone holidays, theme parks, restaurants anywhere spending money needed. mRNA vaccines specifically target protein RBD structure, actual key spike virus uses enter cell. 

Think vaccines like tumblers lock. key wears little time use it. makes key little less easy use. Eventually tumblers recognize key, door unlock. Likewise, mutations make vaccine little less efficient binding proteins. eventually unlock lock need to, requires specific sequence. I'm glad knew advance. Otherwise would've screamed seeing increase today I'm playing devils advocate equally obtuse worse. obviously different every person work place. me, legitimately needs face face help coworkers provide others.

My industry really struggling pandemic. 

Don’t assume nuts! exported EU. It’s British company American company.
The American taxpayers paid vaccines, still waiting get it.

As per news today 30s 1 250k chance getting blood clot Tell get hobby rather force interactions.  company talking hybrid cases permanent WFH. believe training certain meetings person. I'm definitely one people could cruise along ""just fine"" 4-6 hours younger, notice much need sleep now. 

I'm really curious: kinds health consequences talking about? sleeping properly alone, related sleep connects everything else (bad sleep=poor diet, increased risk depression/anxiety, etc.)? says home isolated though? make good points, may hints actual numbers article, ""93% indoors"" similarly bit misleading.

The article says ""20%"" cases determined origin. clear whether means 20% *all* cases, 20% ""contact traced"" cases. However, Ireland pretty robust contact tracing efforts. last week March, completed contact tracing ~3,300 cases ~4,000. So, even 20% contact traced people, ""actual"" denominator probably still quite high. would wager actual percentage still significantly less According Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), average American spends 93% life indoors. 87% life indoors, another 6% life automobiles. That’s 7% entire life outdoors.

First, I'm sure got 1% figure ""this year"". anything, would wager year higher years. Also, ""7% outdoors"" figure presumably includes sleeping time, ought closer 10%. 

All together, still points conclusion outdoor transmission likely least 10x less indoor, backed sources.  work home I'll legit take pay cut work home.  fired get done home there's less distractions. Plus employer saving lot money keeping offices shut. hopeful happy medium users unhappy vaccine tracker posts flooding sub, really value discussion it. Well let’s see

I waiting second shot I’m fine end restrictions campus learning activities White collar workers easy always find something complain about.   next week, testing r/Coronavirus daily megathread dedicated discussing number vaccines delivered administered different countries.

Feel free post discussion, article links, et cetera, comment section [at sort Best, please modmail us actionable feedback preferring comments set New. fuck that. I'd rather lonely (which I'm not) pay arm leg get work. Fuck traffic, fuck office, long live WFH. Discord, ***or something***. let office family replace real ones.

They're poorer interactions superficial often forced. They're also something I/we control over, directly affect my/our ability hold job live. want talk co-workers? ""You're team player."" get passed promotions such, fired. Popularity office could seen defence mechanism fired, possibly homelessness. ""Is Carl, mailroom, super-friendly he's fear job, really like me?"" hard take peoples motivations work seriously threat homelessness driving factor first place. mean, probably wont need to, since reminding day get 2nd dose. right? wrote wrong date. I'm sure lot people actually like routine getting ready driving work. seeing coworkers person instead sitting alone house day nice. even new job. I've company 6 years, moved different project midway last year I've struggling figure who. asked question? customer, us, supplier? What's role? contact answer question? made getting speed program incredibly difficult. I'd imagine private universities could though, correct? think public universities would able make vaccines mandatory .... Obviously everyone gotten yet, said goes away, today. Stop looking arguments Look [deaths per 1 million people among Nordic + Baltic countries similar 
 
Sweden 2nd worst, right behind Lithuania. FL, opened in-person learning Sept school still 50% chose school learning, good chunk stayed virtual. good participation virtual students overall (I’ve never many 5th graders reading grade level). I’m South Florida. district 3000 cases (confirmed positive cases) since then.

I can’t wait back together learning like normally glad families managing stay safe choose. I’m working butt make work! Holy crap thats lot! hell expensive? different food Speaking myself, nothing state guidelines everything risk tolerance. Indoor dining reduced capacity open Oregon I’m I’m fully vaccinated (which mid may). theaters anything involving crowds. still restricted limits gatherings things like that. Hey /u/Wizmaxman got anything us today? kind job able find new WFH arrangement? I’m transition new city thinking trying find wth situation. find strong, lasting friendships work, though, haven’t worked since 2011. done, maybe it’s rare.  CEO: Hey, I've got great idea. Let's reduce produced value 11-12% reason whatsoever, pay expensive office things needed run it.

Executive 1: love plan.

Executive 2: Boss, genius. want back work home make us fill daily log, weekly log, 2 monthly logs activities. I'm noticing trend least locally vast majority people want return office environment work want socialization reasons. guess many readily available outside options socializing. friend mine even pointed towards study (I admittedly read yet) talking work-from-home people detrimental alternative avenue practice navigating discussion discord adult world (outside immediate family). worsened pandemic restrictions shopping, eating out, recreation, etc.

I think speaks individualistic society issues telecommuting quarantine, many people situation becomes highly exacerbated remote work. What? Thanks update. 

""As result, cases today appear artificially high."" Gee, ya think? hospitals danger running capacity use different reason this? quit without backup job lined up. mortgage pay, family feed medications need insurance. honestly called back office (which am) making look. even 1-2x week tho? literally show. assume youve proven year. 0/5 2/5 (kinda) 40% increase office time. huge change show anyone know reported vaccine efficacy rates effected mask wearing controlled for? 

IE: Pfizer 95% effective number partial by-product everyone wearing mask around people received vaccine... don’t see people wouldn’t want work hotel pandemic? would put risk collect unemployment Exactly. Promotions around 10-12% one promotion ladder 55% bump.  I'm concerned what's happening Canada, ago ""leak"" ""schedule"" Canada would follow pandemic order implement social credit system seem following extremely closely. 45k nothing. Overtime pay make killing especially government jobs Count one those, dont want return full time office, already felt like outdated set rules.  u apply work home job?  There's many different types.

I highly prefer working office. kids. constantly battling awful home Internet phoneline services. bills jumped considerably attempt improve above. took toll health. 

However, would never wish choose whether someone WFH not. That's upto company. 34% remote workers can’t afford quit jobs. quit day office required everyone back. Fuck that. Joined wife's home daycare. Kids suck better office lol  Heard reasoning department’s HR representative weeks ago. sort hybridized model likely become common employees able work home order stay competitive recruiting/hiring new employees. Agh sorry lump generation! meant say that, based anecdotal totally scientific experience, seems like 35ish mark are, likely want go back, goes older millenial friends closer 40 well. also boomers life happy WFH forever tend really progressive innovative ones.

You hit nail head. job probably like 70% bullshit job really know it. That's actually part took time - need save money knew would problem setting work/life boundaries BS office job running ground mental health counseling work couldnt ever say often unpaid work. boomer boss cannot fathom idea tha would rather keep lower level job like job kind BS (although would never, ever use type terminology around obvious reasons) let's prioritize non work things. idea making office center whole world complety alien him. intellectually wrap head around mentality became pervasive generation cannot understand emotional level. Right? don’t already cushy jobs sitting day. I’ve commute shop throughout whole pandemic. lol. 'No, you!' workplace, 100% people small children. Anyone kid 2-5 coming pretty regularly.

They hate families, basically impossible work around toddler. Taking time shit alone difficult enough.

It's reality small children. bounce thing thing can't really expected leave one parents alone 8 hours day. incomprehensible child. Pinkachu face issue Pfizer, get drive road single jab rather make 2 trips. last week subreddit everyone was...

If form opinion based random redditors post surprised reach wrong conclusion.

Whitty one recognisable people country majority PM's daily briefings watched millions.

Anyone claiming widely openly talked UK weeks know they're talking about. suburbs considerably cheaper city choice people. employees afford live anywhere near city work choice have?

They cant afford work live due low pay cant afford live work...so im really seeing much choice. know flu kill you? high chance, course, mention wanting reduce risk, even tiny amount. 

And great vaccinated - I'm understanding argument want reduce risk particular disease even tiniest margin care others. least getting something....🤦‍♂️ big concern people care it’s happening schools decades didn’t relocate. moved company company B 10k increase. Earned promotion company B 18k. Moved back company 15k salary bump + 10k signing bonus. 

45k salary increase 3 years without leaving home pretty substantial Backlog dump deaths think people would consider idea looking people riding transit insane. can't understand people would try use something like drive class divisions not.

In city think power holders aware condescending attitudes towards public transit. simply use think priority make 100% dependable safe.  Quite opposite, feel woke letting mobile drug markets holding people accountable breaking rules.

They think acceptable professionals deal things like randomly cancelled pickups.. even last one night managed get cancelled me, leaving walk home extremely bad part town.

If ride they'd make sure drivers could security waiting next stop security footage would deciding factor ever allowed ride again. 

The drivers know futile stay quiet make day worse. Romania. government uses queue system anyone register to, old/sick people essential personnel priority general population. However, reports 300.000 people cancelling AZ appointments following latest news. made possible general population get vaccinated since fairly easy find AZ vaccination centers queues anymore. 

However, want get vaccinated Pfizer Moderna part general population... wait long time. That's good know. Thank you. Completely agree. term “genocidal” silly. people go overboard name something diminishes reaction real thing happens. Meanwhile, 50% us office workers, business usual. basis recommendation risk ICU admission would higher? second dose risk ICU admission would zero, right? corrected get second dose. issue never widespread see students getting 0% classes. they're person even they're apathetic usually get least little bit.

US Journal medicine completed study vaccine natural infection (recovered) vs new variants. GET SICK still. It’s weird small percentage either. say wait fall... said keep masks, presumably something changes. waiting for? think highly disruptive measures strong data support continued use.  Preface: getting vaccine certainly anti-vacc... wondering people concern whether others vaccinated. 

For instance, there’s party 10 people 8 people vaccinated, would 8 got vaccinated care whether 2 didn’t? Especially given fact vaccine doesn’t prevent carrying virus giving others. 

I’m hoping someone clear since I’ve seeing lot people gotten vaccinated shaming haven’t. Better working sick without mask. Try DFW, trendy cool Austin market seems less competitive since million startups shiny FAANG companies Saying Pfizer fine amounts nothing?

Getting downvoted raising single vaccine dozen prices everyone rich countries contention lives apparently mean less? saying nothing?

Turning around making comparison AZ holier-than-thou business practices despite first point EU-centrics make defending vaccine - mistake? 

(BTW: AZ clearly struggling already, mean EU side. lose corporate backers, break even - sales forced believe believe cost EU whilst see equivalent ordered middle income nations, charged $3 subsidise shortfall. I'm interested debate feel free engage) Didnt read article. implication variant activity higher 5 states? Words could take heart explain hospitals requiring it? Don’t think universities require it, especially public ones. study lines studies showing distressingly high percentage COVID survivors wide range concerning medical conditions long considered recovered. think it’s important make people aware COVID isn’t risk death severe disease. think part too, like work, tend lingering contact event supervised considered ""less dangerous"", cause... know, friends! insane people everywhere. responding comments lol. I’m even sure you’re saying anymore well, think bad policy give free funerals military veterans, even ones didnt get deployed, means broadcast loud clear bad breath dead   Yay! 🎉🍾💉🎊 *sigh* next wave commence June 15th mark calendars Huh? PA million cases Michigan 780k total, MI also trails deaths. Chick-fil-a restaurant ever see employees wearing mask correctly every time, even time. I’m sure employees like said go unmasked church. least respectful enough wear work. employees fast food restaurants not. I’d imagine also engage risky behavior outside work.  quacks like duck.... Thanks educated opinion matter. I’m sure know epidemiology better expert actually studied it. US 14th highest deaths per capita. non-European country top 17. like US Brazil handled well come see comments badly Belgium, Czech Republic, Italy, Spain, etc. handled disease?  super dumb really think measures used contain highly transmittable respiratory disease currently killing thousands people day currently real effective treatment going used diseases. Like. Super dumb. elderly (and families) might've died less focused rollout would probably vote way. Canada's average daily COVID deaths peaked January 26th; since they've dropped 82%, largely due heavily targeting care homes 80+ year olds early on. That's comparable countries like Israel (87% drop peak) US (76% drop peak) much faster rollouts. Yup mass end sight! I’m trying cynical, I’m excited progress June 15, I’m prepared masking next couple years. say it’ll definitely several years, I’ll okay tracker they're using lists fully vaccinated per capita... strategy give single shot push back 2nd get people partial immunization. course kind ranking look awful... know Texas bad? know certainly lifetime. AI currently shown aptitude kind work. talking 100 years later pointless exercise non sequitur. See 5 years. discuss look forward it. Bad news: literally thousands people die every day. Lots car crashes, heart attacks, work accidents...tons things. 

And keep living. haven’t experienced that. random Microsoft advertisements cortana talking occasionally. Good point. Especially trying handle many concurrent users VPN.  addition, Arizona already two bad waves, probably higher population immunity national average. Oh feel like could fun that. Ask antenna reception tomorrow?  I'd REALLY surprised vaccines applied US give significant protection least 2 years, I'm conservative. covid? first shot brutal?

People covid report bad first shot hardly nothing 2nd shot Anyone values around people would disagree you. there's one thing learned hell pandemic, NEVER take job involves remote work *cries deal types people whether they're remote office* take wrecking ball whole Monday Friday 9-5 mindset first fucking place?  Come sit back cubicle, spend 1 hour plus commuting, pay lunch/meals, finish early sit pretend work hours, what’s love going back work! Yay! amazing find choose yardstick - mentioned general public statistically illiterate, MHRA.  got yelled sub saying wouldn’t wear mask outdoors. Called “nuts” everything. 

Under circumstances, there’s reason wear mask outside. None. It’s silly point. don’t need mask soon get car. hysteria come back earth soon. I'm 34% boss knows it. I've advocate remote work years took global pandemic company realize lot us actually PRODUCTIVE, happier, healthier working form home. avoided catching covid-19, even gotten sick since home. even cold last 14 months. fantastic! Germany could also approve Sputnik V national legal framework BfArM. decent reasons it, especially suspiciously low rate adverse effects reported Lancet publication. also check Russians tricked Slovakia delivered unapproved batch. Shown hand? side effect COVID become conspiracy theory spouting troll? CDC gives advice guidance based medicine science. individual vaccinated mean pandemic entire world forget pandemic start packing bars sports stadiums.

Neither CDC, credible doctors scientists sort malicious motive want everyone stay locked forever. Nobody wants that, stop pretending that's people actually want. Nobody wants that. want see us fuck 1 yard line, seems people absolutely intent doing.

If vaccinated, personal situation changes bit, expect world cater want immediately, yeah, going happen. We'll get there, soon, going tomorrow. government agency tells people always use oral dam intimacy isn’t going give green light full return normalcy 1.5 year old virus there. Yup, I'm worried cutoff age willing get vaccinated. age cutoff somewhat arbitrary. would hope UK moves inform people vaccine receive book appointment (at moment told show up) wanting receive AZ look alternative appointments. totally agree. different nuances acquaintanceship disappears. also sounds like company “culture” thing. onboarded current company three years ago remote employee. meet daily, water cooler sessions Zoom, even permanently open Zoom room drop day. question, drop Zoom room there’s probably two three people hanging work. ongoing group chat Teams. We’re always connected, even play games online together team outings milestone celebrations. 

I’m betting one big differences team remote oriented years, people offices (pre-COVID) always remote people including always priority. don’t see mandated get togethers necessary? guess companies teams, depending nature work, wouldn’t make blanket statement all. Would reasonable assume people would move, what’s point making travel get together online? worst part needle. get stuck time flu shots blood panels.

But needle felt like arm fire, even injected vaccine. focus getting back normal cost, don’t think enough discussion normal was. normal waste hours life traffic you’ll never get back? normal sitting building pretending work, rather amount work home enriching downtime personal productivity? normal 2-5 hours day things go work? people’s time worth sit office? 

And cannot work home, physically present job location rewarded monetarily, since travel work? physical work finically compensated since wear tear body greater? 

I feel like rushing back work culture abusive harmful people. enough done improve mental physical exhaustion work takes people. feel like pandemic could best opportunity systematic change work culture, everyones life could improve. little hope now. 800 people every day isn’t minuscule. infected people they’re staying home? Yes, that's issue discussed here? There’s way tell vaccinated isn’t without wide scale vaccine passport program, one US stand for. messaging around nothing changing vaccination disappointing, can’t say it’s fine go back normal vaccine public health standpoint. yet. cdc stressed guidance change population vaccinated. someone marathon meetings, two questions:

* makes believe ""socializing"" going meetings?

* Would prefer one 8 hours meetings day? hybrid working model works certain types companies jobs, get workforce job, people office going significant advantage easier communication. one person who's always working home naturally going ignored. colleagues want - common denominator want get away family (usually kids) can't go back normal everyone wants vaccine gotten it. clearly appetite segregating unvaccinated vaccinated vaccinated go back normal, would alternative. Absolutely 101% correct. There's absolutely reason continue antiquated mode operation old asshole thinks office runs best using 1950s model. 60/40 office/home covid. honestly transition 100% worse would thought. main reason boundaries. Someone tweeted pretty early “don’t call working home. Call is: living work.” absolutely describes me.
So I’ll probably go back office sometime soon 2 3 days week. (Personally really like office days. went 3 months (Oct-Jan) without anyone saying word office. nice.

But mainly want “clear break” work home sometimes: leave office don’t think work next morning. since work pays train fare work train, it’s huge difference financially time wise. Yes staying home makes work experience worse I'm right insist work.

There many introverts pain ass work think every social interaction ""wasting time"". summer we’ll getting toward new normal, and, variants don’t disrupt control, fall we’ll new normal. addressed [previous Thanks! Everyone wants vaccine full vaccinated like July latest. reason hold back anymore! GAS 300+ get WFH job? Feels like I'm poorer end one types job. knew 2020 would year everyone better career/job would WFH related comment? NL-63 though? one unique endemic CoV also binds ACE2. That’s sure. started new role halfway across country soon work home set place. I’ve worked year met 4 coworkers person. kinda sucks sometimes. Looking states actually publish numbers, doubt applies meaningful number doses. Also, nothing prohibiting vaccination centers finding flexible solutions situations. $$$ remember someone nyc sub posting picture taken empty NYC streets. response got avalanche people yelling GO BACK INSIDE. batshit crazy. think average news junkie easily spent hundreds hours it. Even hour day last year adds up.   People forget choice live 85miles job. need denormalize suburbs. want add parents don’t hate near kids, going office nice break allows appreciate around are.  Exactly do. get new jobs within company. Increase great lot I'd get piddly raises. know principals mentality lol team took survey work. 100% team want go back office - means work probably require heading back in. Tends run way..  You’re downvoted you’re right us. increased costs WFH outweigh savings double. again.

Companies seriously able hire overseas aren’t slowed workforce working home. Believe me, thought would save money, already getting ready it. 

Hiring overseas isn’t easy say is. There’s lot problems hassle, depending work. Maybe future overseas workers become competitive US workers, right skilled labor, it’s panacea. Dude finally tasted little bit autonomy, want let go. can't fault that. Maybe giving mainly older people Norway younger people? Everything cover lol Lol ever watched “The Good Wife”? Measles still kills 100,000 kids year, even tho great vaccine. Measles lot infectious Covid. vaccination, lower risk. likely, Covid long-term health threat. variants great unknown – may require tweaks vaccines, not. 

Bottom line: Equitable vaccine administration IMPORTANT thing must do, nationally globally. work refuses anyone work home. We're ""vaccinated"" asses need work nothing quit. recovered individuals? I'd rather still get paid, I'll whatever fuck lol Yeah, team done ""happy hours"" work Zoom. good excuse log work right 5, pour beverage choice, actually get know coworkers actual people.

Would highly recommend team/company 100% wfh. Especially people new group personal relationships coworkers. again!!! Spot on! Fukushima close Tokyo Holy shit sounds fucking draining sounds much like I've seen Maryland friends similar states. think indoor dining allowed reduced capacity, certainly know anyone who's wanted eat indoors people. We've socialized indoors wife's family handful times past year (with windows open improve airflow) that's all. Lots takeout, lots grocery deliveries, lots masks. hysteria sub real around time last year. recall getting PMs calling terrible parent got downvoted messages personal reddit history basically remarking considered common sense today: healthy young adults kids generally little worry about, focus protecting elderly higher risk categories.

It's amazing much vitriolic hate one gets suggesting kids much healthier getting exercise fresh air, parks remain open lockdowns.

Reminds war drugs war terror. Lots immediate knee-jerking panic years regret later.  Stop breaking narrative, UK bashing smh everyone wants live government. us want actually work support like adults. ""give free shit"" agenda needs stop. magical money tree. Working compromise. Rarely work situation affects you. That's hybrid solutions talked team best solutions. big events generally allowed ireland! I’m bored people say introverts love want keep WFH doesn’t apply me. 
The best definition know introvert someone “recharges” alone time chill (likewise extrovert needs social interaction “recharge”).

I still enjoy socialising, still enjoy seeing faces colleagues known years shared parts life with. like getting house feeling buzz outside world.

Introverts extroverts humans social creatures us need socialise mental health. family kids home that’s great don’t quite literally becomes torture alone constantly.

Sweden 11 times deaths among Under-70 group Norway. fact, Sweden 1.8 times many deaths Under-70 group Norway total.

Even exclude 70+ age group, Sweden significantly worse Norway. This!!! see job hybrid since work computer tower monitors home. seems like nothing scenario point. parents want home kids


Then don’t kids. ridiculous 12 hour days, 3 days week home much better 12 hour days, 3 days week office. No, I'm getting downvoted thread full misanthropes Got second pfizer dose yesterday 11:00 I've zero side effects minor tenderness injection site. Hopefully indication I'm producing immune response. Fine. I'm going take money give random people. objection this. mean going tell 1970s called want retorts back I'm disengaging conversation clearly rocker.

Have good one tho! pandemic went office every two weeks free lunch. expect we'll know soonish move back concentrating previous vaccines' clinical trials. Phase 1 already Maybe people think get back normal day get jabbed? father thought developed antibodies right away, within days. Hell, father thought could INFECT PEOPLE COVID first dose. asked stay away coworkers day got first dose. love Dad people, like him, type see headlines like take literally run it. gonna fight out, see variant better mutations /s  1 hour vs 100hours. huh? don’t sit back ride let others best without hear uninformed judgement great quote, I'm using one proposing regulation though. Vaccines going whomever willing throw cash free market get. I've loved working home. able see family main reason. can't imagine wanting reduce time spent them. Seems sad. Yep, we're currently around ""medium"" circulation UK, fair say somewhere like France Germany high. tough. daughter born too. would complete deal breaker. I'm opposite. many distractions house and, deadlines work, making really anxious lack self control 
Do keep track efficacy rates day getting vaccine?

For example, got 2nd Pfizer vaccine yesterday. efficacy rate today vs tomorrow vs day two weeks? 

I plan follow guidelines, I’m curious much effective vaccine gets day. get outside still? supposed shut every aspect society years end protect minuscule amount people? Time move on. Why? US simply knew along lockdowns BS would destroy economy. Think would happened didn’t vaccines...how long could countries go enforcing lockdowns? Besides flattening curve healthcare, lockdown mean people catch covid later date. Virus going virus. Vaccines matter many US known since early on. 1 day week WFH isn’t flexibility, that’s company pretending absolute minimum would less can. Flexibility people WFH essentially full time come want company rare in-person meetings month less. Businesses hard time attracting retaining talent offer remote working options possible future. wonder could done way people know need educated? seems big barrier US vaccinations reluctance. anecdotally I've several younger people tell they'd rather covid side effects vaccine feel like getting sick vaccine guarantee getting covid isn't. Other's told ""know immune system"" therefore know fight covid easily get vaccine needed. tips/tricks use promote idea vaccines safe/effective? mandatory gym well, people started get sloppy. lot ask trainers police everything, can't tell someone vaccinated not.

For part, decided skip week give first shot time work. wish people could little patient everyone opportunity vaccinated. really hope people dislike working home one reason another, ruin rest us. like biggest fear right now. commute nice. live work, terrible. I'm also tech support.

But then, work myself.

Personally, would prefer work office, option remote work. times need interact people best done person. don't, emails suffice. someone gives life back year, blood pressure normalizes, anxiety gradually begins recede, suddenly happier working home years, really make sense surrender blessing? mean, employers threaten terminate refuse return office, certainly return office. extorted. *do* consider form extortion. person ages underlying health condition absolutely reason take vaccine. outsourcing companies going value stock market. think stock market smarter Oh yeah agree completely. proponents free market rarely admit bottom line. There's supposed invisible hand regulating virtuous way. :) I’m office right now. work medical coding billing. come one day week. kid remote learning. I’m computer, work home. company pushing full time office hours. hate coming now. There’s point home. get gas time saved $450 month. mean, I'll wear mask outdoors I'm going standing RIGHT NEXT people, I'm 10ft more. EU prohibit member buy vaccines own, e.g. Hungary also bought Chinese Russian. telling day someone else wfh need something wait they're office instead sending email?

You go whenever want, care, stop trying dictate others do, there's need compromise List countries Human Development Index: countries Happiness: outranks USA metrics. Also notice general class countries well. come evidence support hypothesis. anyone else bad reaction Johnson Johnson? Going sleep mild headache thought fine. NOPE. woke 2 minutes felt like dying. felt hot disoriented woke up, went pee head/stomach started hurting felt increasingly nauseous. finish peeing work appropriate muscle well enough stomach pain. gave peeing leaving bathroom I'm pretty sure passed second remember ending floor falling shoulder. Luckily nothing around hit head shoulder feels bruised.

I've saved **15 hours week** commuting. went place zero tolerance policy work home 100% work home. I'm happy go times week, thought going back 100% feels unbearable. can't put genie back bottle. said go back full time immediately I’ve quit. good thought I’m sure discussed enough. Would u drive ice cream truck around minimum wage also sell weed side using ice cream truck front.  response correct one here. large companies work home cannot allowed continue work home direct threat 90% middle management, they're ones access executives, workers. dont get paid social skills. get paid work. develop social skills I'm fucking *socializing.*

Pay work. smile talk weather.  Lots ""outdoor dining"" enclosed tents almost zero air flow. cracking rather banning outdoor dining Count hybrid approach. silver lining pandemic bonding son, 2.5 years old. I've gotten see day I'm working spend time evening I'm commuting. 

It also makes things like waiting repair man much easier. rearrange whole day.

Running errand lunch much easier. usually wait work cutting family time. 

That said, like going office too. Starting new job lockdown weird. miss friends work. much harder build rapport someone Zoom. Incubation period coronavirus 2-14 days. Seeing new cases fall week restrictions imposed would consistent restrictions effect. find internet serious answer would people good home life, lack private space, need ""get away"" distraction whil office. 5+ kids, even space world, WFH would often viable. said, I've hybrid last year great. I'm never going back 100% job 2 years left. office little remote work allowed covid forced home. team another time zone never officially met them.

I started new job remotely really good team. Got COVID final day old job. far good. new team even flies people main office yearly events cool. Well post pro-CCP stuff. Well supply 60 million doses around world cases low India. Plus, justified AstraZeneca unable deliver promised doses EU Canada? Oh interesting thanks. still things, two weeks second dose give af. mean I'll still wear mask, that, back normal. Count group. There’s way I’m going back think paid for. Commuting known cost workers see companies paying gas car maintenance (in cases anyway).

I'd rather see subsidize public transport passes reduce traffic. CEO loathed remote workers.. 2020.  spending months realizing people still worked, it.

Source: Office drone several years. June/July we’ll enough people vaccinated lot things able open, **and fall new normal** ... “hang months longer” frustrating message, it’s right one.

What mean say ""new normal""? applaud bringing meme 4 years ago describe life today, nobody except mentioned bringing daughter *into* calls. Hard justify money rent office space huge chunk workforce desire work building anymore.

But also want enough space everyone come back want, so....

Yeah, options amazing, paying rent sucks. luxury office space home that: luxury. Don’t include default argument want taken seriously. 85% homies say they'd rather go Disneyland work tomorrow.

* Time tell. Hope things stay relatively low.

But NO, remove restrictions – look Michigan. need hang people die to.

Sometimes kids turn monsters, matter raised. can't pick family, sort happens. however pick work, coworkers (at least time). like idea. I’m sure rules allow us look it. meet people lunch get socialization aspect? 

If everyone lived within 10-15 minutes specific lunch place, sure? that's hardly ever case, least work city. agree every situation career field same. think hybrid situation like one day work week may work. However, also think would hold back lot people wish travel different sort lifestyle.

That's said something flexible would nice. I'm sure someone's wish travel this? WFH vacation, assume that's meant. I've worked places someone got permission WFH couple months wanted go abroad months. fine. Predictability important manager employer. point work making friends. business wants hire people who's first priority socializing. okay people handle responsibly quite frankly not. manager typically happens petty drama different workplace cliches form others get left out. Others get frustrated feel coworkers pulling weight see standing around chit chatting clock. drag supervisors managers middle mediate.

Sounds like worked exceptionally toxic places, tbh. right mind would get mad co-worker casual conversation somebody else? mean, country coffee breaks together (on clock, yes) like social norm. That's get know people little better, makes easier understand other. also get know people outside team, also helpful lowers barrier ask help there, discuss ideas, etc. 

I never said first priority work make friends, required want to, friendly, non-work related interactions co-workers usually beneficial, general work environment making people like there. Masks never 100% protective. Vaccine certificates inevitable. must entirely voluntary i.e. opt in. Privacy must iron clad.

I'll quit make go in. commute fucking nuts, lol. I'll get higher paying contract job able side projects without bullshit restrictions. knew I'd quit job read bullshit docs sign.

They seem surprised can't hire many people they're losing (also open Dallas office, bad local rep killing anyone wanting work there, better shit jobs state). Im really struggling understand people would rather *never* return office.

I would prefer 2 3 days office rest house. Ive met several friends life work still talk years moved on.

I course friends outside work cannot imagine interacting colleagues random things life etc.

It makes work lot easier, think, banter good small talk colleagues. office training work home job can't fucking wait able home working. job wfh opportunity. understand frustration, CDC needs outright say can’t transmit covid vaccinated clear mess up. Even statement 97% true far better “i don’t need vaccine get anyway” Looks like it’s opening teachers Montréal weekend. Hopefully first card fall many. funerals happened. delayed due covid people still dying. I’ve WFH 6 years now. recently merged slightly larger company whispers bringing us back in. 2 weeks notice hit 2 weeks need report office sure. would 4 hour round trip commute bc Atlanta traffic fucking sucks soooo much. two days, I'd also suggest could off-peak commuting hours lessen burden would still think 2 days many. ie, require 10 - 4 office avoid peak commuting cover rest home days. dozen people infected COVID-19 western Sydney church last year airborne transmission, evidence suggesting asymptomatic chorister spread virus particles 14 metres members 24 people Lady Lebanon cluster mid-August, including household contacts, virus transmitted three days church services previous transmission event resulted one death: Jamilie Joseph, 80-year-old grandmother regular parishioner Harris Park analysis virus spread, conducted Western Sydney Local Health District made available week, concluded attendees caught COVID-19 airborne spread man singing man, asymptomatic attending restaurant soon uncovered exposure site, give virus 10 choristers standing beside him, people sitting one side performed four services across three days choir loft 3.5 metres congregation. easier milk time office. one thing noticed comes work office 100% never got work home covid. one lady sits office hours end fuck clocking shit ton time. can't home work speak itself. Naw dude, see you’d like get know send message teams slack talk work. That’s new gig it’s working fine Exactly. used spend 90 minutes/day car nothing. use 90 minutes answer emails prep dinner, hang kids get menial tasks done. Also ignores fact people constantly gunning next step up.

Some us happy job, cutting 40hr check, going home enjoy time family, friends, hobbies. Kia Soul, 14 gallon gas tank 

Of course driving outside commute lot back then, lol I'll allow it. true! must young one didn’t work outsourcing boom 2004 it’s still going on. also missed Ralphs closed stores didn’t pay hazard pay California. cite recent stuff you’d like. Thanks, updated! No, assemble freely follow rules designed stop spread covid: wearing masks keeping distance other. dont misdemeanour isnt enforced moment. I've turned good job offers places allow wfh. even one day week wfh refreshing let's catch chores time. point, expect environment place demands office 100% extremely shitty upper management completely touch reality. I'm gonna lie, Tom Frieden first choice Reddit AMA. AREN’T MEANT LIVE LIKE THIS! EXPLOITED!  Talk cheap people severe reactions vaccine. I've generally read people previously covid seem respond severely vaccine. Getting bed 3 minutes start time incredible. 

Wtf? shower, eat, brush teeth, anything else start day start working? Waking literally 3 minutes starting sounds awful. haven’t vaccinated kids. Teachers also haven’t prioritised. it’s hard say amount immunity little know weird virus be. It’s effective virus rip tear vaccinate people.  agree seems hard sell amongst younger friends. difficult pitch people early 20s still feel invincible. wish would develop pill vaccine. hate needles. doesn’t sound like impedes job though, it’s something miss view culturally important. aren’t paid make friends. Personally would guess I’m bit older friends family free time used up, honestly spending full day office last thing want go group. get doesn’t apply everyone situation unique. Yes comment cites article pretty Much entire schedule budget last years. Woke 5:30 got home 7:30. Commuter rail, ferry etc didn’t get see toddler 15 minutes sometimes days time I’d miss bed times. aggravating. WFH wasn’t allowed. Felt like missed everything office hated. 

Also sports fan actually watch NBA NFL games work instead catching last 10 mins get home. true. I'm looking permanent work home job mothafuckas tell time come in. Congrats U.K! Moderna shit don’t agree. Colleges already requiring it. places follow. got J&amp;J vaccine. I’m relieved happy statistic lol bus? bus route 2.5 hours? Surely must better way get there? There's big difference openly telling others health information private corporations requiring business them.

I'll openly tell people I'm organ donor. mean corporation's business ask it.

Privacy never disclosing anything. never forced disclose things. Dawg, we’ve closed multiple COVID units last couple months open 100%. Go Texas Motor Speedway see flight vaccinations. It’s sight behold. Yikes. wait till employ cheaper labor India work home Yeah, gotta eat... know. I'm definitely anti-vaxxer &amp; think I'm asshole. 

I allergic flu shot &amp; lot relatively ""normal"" prescription drugs (it's bad wear medical alert bracelet), body guess. Like completely normal person, avoid things could put life danger. extremely worried allergic reaction this. time eligible, knew rate reactions low probably affect me. Yep - new version ping pong tables free lunch. I’m dead throw trash! That's interesting fact unfortunately, saying two different things think misunderstood. one said putting fewer 8 hours per day. necessarily consecutive. 

And others pointed out, I'm able *do* hours I'm working increased, feel like I'm getting life office full time. missing point happens people work motivated. taking 10 minutes play daughter meetings *keeping* productive, allowing overall.  That’s figured. That’s good process. 

I get asked lot (I’m IT) figure “active” employees home. That’s really good way measure productivity. It’s also hard figure many ways people choose work. 

The right measurement ability produce/deliver deliverables. Ну давай тогда на русском поговорим, раз ты русский. Что ты там собрался рассказывать? Unlikely. Possible clades spread bit died out. That's one theory. Time tell, we'll learn coming months years. That's science works! anything like long time, common cold coronaviruses, anything like this! funny different career field different workplaces. fucking love PO, point everything need _enjoys_ playing enforcer role business sponsors dev team making sure actually bother us.

He leads sprint reviews business meetings us keep business scope creeping, lets us take encyclopedia knowledge get actual planning grooming.

The ones normally checking meetings dev qa team, problem admitting involved person 😅 Covid me. Two weeks second shot I'm back normal. Going spend weekend restaurants bars 🎉 Yeah needs bit shift mindset.

You get ""bumped watercooler"" conversation anymore, need explicitly _make_ time.

In office, meetings work. everyone's WFH good leave minutes aside end meetings bullshit catch up.

I schedule regular meetings key people ostensibly work purposes. kinda replaces work aspect #1 find stuff going on, problems people having, overhearing talking bumping asking going, etc. There's lots stuff isn't, own, big enough someone schedule meeting really add up, regular outlet look ""we're gonna spend time anyway, bar bringing stuff zero"" really valuable. Combined ""meetings work"" helped build keep relationships people.

It's do-able, socialization came without much effort (was basically forced) office requires conscious effort.

(We've hiring like crazy, 1/3 people deal regular basis I've never met person, rest co-workers Time(TM). I've got bit worlds here.) becoming fully vaccinated end game masks, is? someone fully vaccinated, need mask anymore. Several studies proven efficacy vaccines real-world conditions (90+% mRNA vaccines). mean, isn't. additional expense nothing compensation package, unless employer used pay pass refusing to.

You could live downtown walk work, choose to. also choose deal consequences decision, includes longer, expensive commute. fair point used spend 1 hour getting work every morning sometimes 2 fucking hours getting home..... plan returning office. Assuming truthful, blame shutdown well government handouts that.

Free shit tends destroy businesses. funny think work life one else right anything else except machine 9 straight hours per day, 5 days per week. 

I nothing else nice say man, let's go separate ways here. count people second dose 2-3 weeks ago time take develop clotting, looking closer 2 million second doses. Estimating gap 8 weeks, people first dose late January latest, Pfizer still made vast majority vaccines given.

AZ second doses happened long enough ago relevant probably numbers hundred thousand. Exactly. think would great people could pick choose. Well guess random news channel getting covid means fully clear immunity time wedding comes. Even vaccinated, would worrying people. Wait till find growing old lot probably ignorance longer term impacts. first I'm hearing long term elevated heart rates pay attention stuff. Luckily could walk grand central yes that’s killer. someone working downtown would $430 train + $127 metrocard + $67 parking = $624 month factor car expenses. soon get it. delay reason would treated antibodies Covid itself. consult oncologist. sooner get vaccinated, better. Yeah wish. Sadly possible. get vaccines Netherlands, Curacao terrible position also small, Netherlands van get island vaccinated days. Netherlands big things. Please clarify:

* 1 3 **new** neurological psychiatric problems before?

* problems conclusively linked covid? could caused something else? Yep, you’re going offer full time remote (for jobs done, obviously) you’d better prepared harder find good employees addition replacing employee stubbornness already lost you. There's strong evidence single shot mRNA gives tremendous protection (comparable better 2 shots normally) infection. Tax hikes good going back office work? started software engineering job hired 20 new grads trained, included. SUCKS able see person, tried make connections can. discord server 18 opted join, want go bars vaccinated. hang there, things get better. easily see gas + parking. ball started rolling.

This 8th university US require vaccines, universities require it, join in, expect majority colleges come next 5 months.

Rutgers, Brown, Northeastern, Cornell, Fort lewis, Nova Southeastern, St Edwards, Notre Dame.

&amp;#x200B;

And 2 Ivy League colleges, literally prestigious colleges world. would want go back office 5x week?

Oddly enough, people **really** like coming office. don't, understand mindset shift hybrid schedule would best option people, though see many places offering that.

Really? think far common full-blown remote work. Come 1-2 days/week schedule team meetings/discussions/etc. otherwise get shit done home.

I know options available companies view ""all nothing"" proposition. *either* 100% remote workers 100% in-person workers. Let employees departments decide works best how? Unless winter months used drop houses temp drastically there. 

My electricity usage barely changed, surely went far less amount used spend gas car (not even counting 10k fewer miles maintenance would gone car past year) bragging, telling simple fact without moral judgement.

Personally, think barbwire style lockdown crazy without proper help gov rather insane strategy. say started company would kill office right now. get acclimated I'd fine working remotely, annoying hell schedule zoom calls get speed instead able walk someone's desk ask question careful 2 weeks second dose! You’ll ok point is, though, Covid made likely recurrence, whereas infections didn't.

Well, know infections study, yeah, Covid made recurrence likely illnesses. 23.59% non-hospitalized Covid patients ""Mood, anxiety, psychotic disorder (any)"". report raw rates RTI group, hazard ratio 1.18, roughly calculate raw rate 23.59/1.18, 19.99%. 

I think people see headline think 24% covid patients anxious, compared 20% sinusitis (etc) patients. think something much sinister. follows BBC **and** gives flying fuck ketchup packet shortages? live NYC. normal commute people live outer boroughs work Manhattan. almost many people circumstances ideal live 5 blocks office therefore given opportunity least work partially home choose! “Rather” protected fully 2 weeks second dose.

The best way convince listen first. See reply above. Thanks good luck! Also look Luntz videos That's funny think I'm selfish one trying non-work stuff work.  true, trust me.. get cutthroat hardcore expectations work home think massively underestimating difficult set manage outsourced work lol, there’s reason everything isn’t already outsourced it’s people didn’t know liked working home


What stopping before? Time zones still thing it’s like isn’t extremely cheap places live US anyways. option live expensive city pay ridiculous rent help economy, hurt makes sense. Thank you! Yep. choice rent nearby buy miles away. 

Also, move every time change jobs (this difficult period unemployment there) - that's ended miles way. obvious work home. plan ask decrease time office rather eliminate - currently work Tues-Fri thinking dropping Fridays long time (esp short day driving seem worthwhile) hope office reopens. extremely lucky.

Luckily get hardware delivered office like 3 people one time. since March 20. save hour drive time every day, pay less gas, pollute planet less less driving sleep more. Hell dont wanna ever go back. Ive proven home! want keep way! know. referring headline, used ""upper west side"" anyone would know city referring to. Moderna deliveries EU attrocious. weeks don’t receive doses (Belgium). get doses it’s fraction promised. far they’ve delivering way target. could show initiative urgency vaccinating Netherlands well.  Dude baseball game 43,000 people state two days ago lol. local station need pay $800 year park factor plus owning car, granted it’s like 8 minute drive still adds cost. dominant, we've also able gather outdoors groups restaurants anywhere, really easy use good data (even though want to) I'm going go limb say they're full shit. imagine we'll see 34% group actually quit jobs comes it. sure got downvoted, main concern variants (at least places using Sinovac/Coronavac) vaccine resistance increased contagion severity. risk. likely we'll see increase different age groups similar gradient age, time tell. fortunately, within month, enough vaccine adults US. walking wrong side road? 😂 This. mention horrendous roads are. added west tear car tremendous. winter bent four rims commuting work.  Depending job, meetings could emails. experience, places I've worked, think meetings fostering ""teamwork"" got higher Snoop Dogg.

But, that's experience, mileage may vary. middle-managers--the type justify existence hovering people's shoulders, pointless daily meetings micro-managing every aspect team.

They're terrified someone's going realize wheels kept spinning entire year without supervision, maybe next ""efficiency"" way layoff THEM. top metrocard. makes almost cases Dominion Canada it’s heading south. article cites paper. know, proof they're claiming exist? Worked job resources overseas years ago. engage personally ask life. still talk play games friends chile UK. Yikes, sound expression ""meeting days"" giving flashbacks constant pointless meetings could email even plain Slack DM. 

I'm sure depends vastly industry, culture company, etc. personally, experienced massive *decrease* time spent meetings since WFH started. To, far tell, particular detriment part projects. People started calling meetings *really* to, instead willy-nilly -- much people chitchat before/during/after meetings definitely also dropped lot, guess may considered detrimental goal buddies coworkers, certainly helps get work done faster really it. Remote meetings kind pain *fun* anyone involved, *good thing*, frankly.

From perspective, setting several days compulsory in-person meetings ""obviously need happen"" seems flawed premise. general, meetings tend least productive part project, large margin. Often achieving little clear value, frequently tying work many, many people need (even make sure people directly involved least one topics discussed attend, definitely guaranteed, moment 1 topic discuss, often, there's going people twiddling thumbs)

So unless nature meetings extremely different industry question, ""minimize meetings greatest extent realistically possible"" clearly obvious goal aim for. Seems pointless hamper goal assuming ""no one could *possibly* manage less 2 days full meetings per week"" instead letting whatever happens, happen. I'm sure approach makes sense right context. One different ones I've personally experienced, though. really need work reading comprehension.  parents Stoll feel safe come fall, that's problem, states. digging hole man. coming across like someone would fired creating hostile work environment. also letting colors show. showing *really* selfish person values everything *anything* anyone else. 

And fuck sake - we've calls people work home. That's literally last 13 months. special this. hybrid, you’re still tied geographically. Fully remote, travel over. Go different beaches mountains whatnot Important balance risks benefits. 100 feet would safer 6, 3 adequate part multilayered strategy including masks, vaccination available, cohorting, rapid identification cases clusters, more. saying that. person statinf preferences said let people choose Nobody forcing job far away home right? happened small isolated parts. Imprisoning people like without even providing enough sustenance despicable. would want that? im saying is, lockdown worked. could go buy food...thats it. Later also allowed us go walks alone. measures need augmented government help. Germany rich enough that. working entire time office good part less traffic. things opening back traffic fucking nightmare really considering looking something remote. new boss said takes 10 hours home office work 8 hours normal office work. said takes 6 hours home office work 8 hours normal office agreed saying thing.

How? dont get lol. Yup that's build relationships vendors, talk sales reps talk life adds little break work Depends vaccine.

Young children generally risk Covid; elderly, immuno-comprimised obese are.

There's need mandate age group reason there's need mandate flu jab. still parents want it, however.

Care home workers/residents different story. chances brings past standard deduction minimal, still represents paycut. article (or maybe study) pretty uninformative considering complicated topic hand really is. says 34% would *rather* quit, goes say people said they’d actively start looking new jobs asked return office. two pretty different things, neither explained enough someone picky like me. 

Like, I’d rather quit return office, didn’t really choice returned office anyway. Also, looking new job, finding one. 

There many remote jobs don’t expect employers suddenly learn care people want, I’d interested statistic many people *actually* quit jobs asked return office. seriously doubt causing harm good versus everyone claims vaccinated stop wearing masks. sure ain't great though. Yeah company heard loud clear forcing us back office going work  Ah, guy posting misinformation again. Get life man. Factor costs morning coffee lunch work errands I’ve saved fortune! Granted costs weren’t necessary always happened! 

I don’t ever want go back! hybrid anything! I’d go month overall meeting/agenda going 2-3x week seems absurd. It’ll probably probably wind even waste commute dollars, seeing though transit parking costs weekly monthly. We’d throwing money away! Okay yea confirming. recently found got covid (and annoyingly, going tell us...they're also anti vax I'm exactly surprised). [Oof.... hybrid, you’re still tied geographically.

Stayed pretty bad 36 hours button sudden fine.  work gov they’re making us come full time starting June. rough transition. full wfh year since 2020 classified “essential” full time anyways. also work conservative Republican local government believes tax payer money shouldn’t wasted things sake optics. example hide work badge lunch people complained gov employees shouldnt wasting tax payer dollars lunch. Good joke. Nee, der Andi Agree! prefer WFH days laundry, sleeping in, etc. I’m going nuts trapped it’s hard turn work off. _could_ always work. _should_ finished thing. 

I tons PC games desk stresses out. 

Hopefully I’ll go back office 1-2 days starting May. show remain ""respectful professional"" arguing people seriousness discussing Santa Claus logistics distributing gifts flying reindeer?

Dude Santa Claus kid's story. think Christians actually believe Santa exists? never believed single time kid. Damn I'm sure say man. clearly educated subject, fine, argue are. sure mean constructive arguments. ones think makes atheist.

I'd love hear ""constructive"" argument turn atheist. really do. seen yet even though keep insisting religion lie. never argued thread Christianity real reason keep commenting isn't. Where's old faith supposed accepting? OK laugh flying spaghetti monster new faith?

When laugh anyone's faith? I'm confused respect person.

Well, I'm honored respected person someone weird obsession telling wrong unprompted. genuinely respect person, like want force beliefs you, would like understand want respect faith, get it. OK believe god 2021. not. could argue religionism even worse anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers similar groups least try construct rational looking arguments.

Haha that's extreme take. Christian, also 100% believer science data. exclusive. 100% pro-vax (getting COVID vax week), 100% proponent combating climate change fullest, refuse dabble conspiracy theories kind. people oppose causes actively hurt society damage future, denying science evidence arguments. hardly consider rational looking.

Yet religion worse? I'll use Christianity example. People flawed, selfish, cruel naturally use Christianity status church cause harm. People representation Christianity viewed so. teachings Christianity represent it. Love thy neighbor, love enemies, help poor, weak, sick, unfortunate, etc. judge us actions bad followers, yes, find lot dirtbags. lot good people strived represent teachings positively impact world. Many best hospitals, giving charities, activists, colleges Christian founded Christians. relatively recent example amazing Christian would Mr. Rogers, Presbyterian pastor wanted spread love good neighborhood. overlook people say religion horrible thing.

I see rational argument idea religion general, specific religions I'm sure general idea. Science contradict possible existence supernatural being. many things may never able explain science religion, speculate. universe form? Possibly gravity pulling matter together, forming galaxies planets observe today. gravity become exist? Maybe supernatural being. scientific laws universe come from? specific formulated mathematical equations yet everything universe follows them? Science explain that, least knowledge. And, finally, age-old question, go die? see way science explain that. think science religion go hand hand.

Religion thing since beginning recorded human history. may truth it, yet may not. mass majority world still follows religion one major reason large population Communism stamping religion countries continuing (China, East Germany, North Korea), otherwise could've possibly another 1 billion religious people. Personally, totally understand agnosticism, claiming world 100% atheist 2021 pretty extreme proof Godless world. Private bathroom freedom play music great perks. office going back full time June. I'd rather quit go back commuting 40 hours month, I'd rather commute homeless, so... Yeah, didn’t suitable office space. Laptop bed didn’t cut professionally long, rent additional space building lay private area multiple monitors. Came hundred month. 24 hours day running lights, equipment, AC instead twelve literally doubled electric bill versus previous year, company would normally paying. 

As savings, actually saved $50/month expenses. Don’t get wrong, benefits way worth afford hit myself. noticeable difference budget, savings.

Even rent stayed same, would still overall hit income. love one day week model.  company maintain physical distancing office team members bond team. interesting read. Someone commented thought housing prices would tank due crisis economic fallout (I too). Oh wrong were. One clients hell bent bringing everyone back office. Nevermind billing/collection operating like never before, payroll/accounting team loving recruiting team naturally switched staggered shifts make productive...

Nope. Everyone coming back work 8-5. exceptions. 

Did mention extremely stingy comes pay shit benefits?

Now they’re like... “Wait... everyone resigning?” don’t get matter much try explain it. 

I told reason they’re “rock star” AP person left “$500 bonus” didn’t mean much new new employer going paying $5k per year... offer great benefits.

Gotta love PE-backed companies. Willing pay consultants tried squeeze pennies actual foundational staff...

Edit: didn’t even mention could save money teams remote - need much space, desks/cubes, etc.

Some people want see little peons scurrying around. really hate client. Rangers? kid high risk due respiratory issues. Y'all seem forget death happen long term damage still possible. Love fact stuck inside live area lower compliance keeps seen scared.

Like really, fuck y'all think want stay home? know unreliable area is. People getting vaccinated soon start seeing vaccinated people whatever want they're going throw caution wind. 

The reason want wait bit see there're problems vaccine. Millions gotten it, problem there.

I want little bit extra time see PEOPLE areas like mine react. There's real chance could cause another surge everyone's busy celebrating premature victory see that. Y'all would rather underestimate stupidity people acknowledge destructive are.

Fucking condescending jackasses. lot vaccine skeptics country. better way encourage mistrust government government make obvious outright lie. people lives 25m2 apartment dont want job completely tied lives?

Yes home small two offices never leaving. fucking hate house yet less entirety indoor existence. can't wait move away abandon negative connotations place taken mind.

Getting mind-wipe stoned dicking around reddit, VR, shower, bed times mind comes close feeling work.

Since I'm always work always time later too. Procrastination become something tracked, timed, logged necessity. ""New"" Ivy league schools

The rest follow shortly, 100%. understand people long expensive commutes, really get why. ran into. Prior covid, job interviews had, always asked possibility working remotely. helped understand environment management style. 
I reading continue run theme may significant shift businesses try go back old ways people move on. 

Items watch - 
-Salary adjustments based live vs job located.

-No longer needing live city, state, country.

Pros Cons say workforce shifted. Ah, read correctly. know DNA Marburg. Though would surprised BioNTech - mean that's specialty? Rent control means controlling rent prices isnt gonna fix fact 3-5 million work NYC live there, bud. like millions apartments sitting empty rent high. There's entire continent people exact timezone America. south? may heard it. There's way certain Covid impact you, even young healthy. theoretical long-term risk might vaccines way lower real likelihood suffer long-term harms virus. said above, [the disease I'm definitely one people. shortage jobs field pay keeps increasing. going make work full time office even time office, I'll immediately start looking another job won't. Since mods allow daily covid vaccine stats anymore, anyone know get info also Catholic University. Catholic Church encourages members get vaccinated, there's small minority members vaccines developed using fetal cells aborted babies. (Doesn't matter abortions occurred decades ago.). fact Notre Dame requiring vaccinations signals they're going allow excuses going forward. J&amp;J Covid vaccine used fetal cell lines development members options. get 30% discount train monthly passes Well played sir. TIL quitting job means never working again. heard 3 4 well. surprise becomes majority. also think kids problem getting shots fall. Supply going wide open weeks. get ready go work sit home nothing.

As if. employer monitors productivity time. There's ""sitting home nothing"" work hours.

All taught job require office. love time reclaimed commuting get extra early morning commute. 

Also, office noisy full chatty, distracting coworkers. productivity actually gone home, free that.

I sad we're forced back office upcoming. Welp, worries KC (stadium middle nothing)! Pre-pandemic, husband make case upper management add bus/train passes employee benefits. building they're parking either, employees take bus train park car another building walk. 

It's wild (but surprising) companies cover bus/train passes, especially parking limited. renting traditionally office/out house day LEDs necessarily make sense replace bulbs pre-installed moved in.

Some awkward bases replace LEDs reason home ~1-2 waking hours day. 5% actually would mean, first identified UK, there's way knowing came from. That's UK stellar work sequencing new variants establish work, technically compliment really. feel like fault remote work bosses. used Slack analogous casual Discord server something would much less problem. certainly age well lol Same.

Yes, always remain ignorant even given opportunity learn. believe less ignorant people days due mentioned items, impossible quantify. on-boarded remotely year ago never met co-workers barely interact daily basis.

This sounds like heaven me.  full information cases occurred ""up 31st March"" looks like figures least delayed period time sure let's get hats on.

While though let's appreciate amazing risk vs charts available UK probably medium exposure risk Europe probably high.

Low risk exposure risk exposure risk exposure Well, teach, anecdotes make data. comparisons nonsensical... special part brain devoted understanding shoe laces barrettes another person translate mood non-verbal language?

But believe me: worried overstep violation basic civil liberties taken world governments collectively ? one . Also percentage disease driven asymptomatic spread , reference respitory driven pandemic driven asymptomatic spread , coronavirus SARS ? debating that. wfh means get pass real estate costs you. ponying up. pocket work kitchen table good guess. 

The real estate market around really hot people looking move city burbs. demand space isn’t theoretical. Unless friends wfh, make difference. last place implemented unlimited time company wide stance behind. leaving managers, means loss benefit. cultural drive encourage people take time off. far working remote choice go elsewhere get benefit. lot people skills option companies mangers require butts seats likely end little that. post political wut guess I’m unusual couldn’t stand working home. got monotonous wasn’t distinct feeling “at work” “at home”. actually started making resent home. worked remotely years. Four five times year I'd fly main office week there. rarely expected productivity level would same. However, admit nice see coworkers person limited periods create stronger working relationships. However, necessary office five days week every week that. 4 times year plenty! White House better check sprinklers working! company made sales losses eliminating travel expenses...and balanced well, made almost entire bonus plan. Makes perfect sense. require vaccinations things weird causing stir. like right wing outrage machines firing something new again. job 100% remote. lease went February company renew. half team works outside city. great. I'm looking now. I'm trying get ahead mass exodus. Yeah told position going fully remote going forward. Win-win. think described queens. big problem city quiet racism. inexpensive live Bushwick, inexpensive live flatlands. good access subways, high percentage BIPOC people. Mostly west indian. Medical imaging here. confirm. Asking people got vac, arm, standard facility I’d rather spend lunch getting house chores done relax get sitting break room hour talking people I’m forced around don’t really give shit about. 15 minutes? super hero? EU 27 countries need compare France. least uptake far 90% plan within 5 weeks announced January. 
It might numbers AZ vaccinations fx BionTech it’s higher, even France.  would recommend fairly sternly communicating office this? I’m almost certain they’re going ask us come back full time it’ll fucking tank me. One hour commute ways. ultimatum wise? Easy always translate efficiently. 

I things remote currently well. Everyone admitted meeting productivity &amp; engagement plummeted since went WFH. nature beast everyone room together. feel this. feel like Im sleeping 8 hours day still waking tired. Luckily workouts still feel good dont feel fatigued otherwise, like I'm always tired. teach preschool. Everyone center got vaccinated except one. lot fun dodging parents asking ""so everyone get vaccinated?"" time. also lot fun room day one....who goes riskier stuff anyone else here. 25 cent “raise” wtf work? extra 2 whole dollars day 😂  ignorant take. lot stopping companies before. Covid forced lot businesses' hand a) developing magnitude infrastructure/security needed full WFH, b) embracing unknowns could've tanked business like employee productivity, satisfaction, customer satisfaction. scale WFH would happened pre-Covid naive suggest otherwise. Get ready rude awakening friend It’s necessarily offensive wrong don’t worry I’ve always “go library” type person. year shown rely heavily getting work done different place live.

2nded. initially enjoyed reclaimed time access home shit eventually work soured home lack peer interaction impacted relationship. lot effort try hard comes letting work friends.  work friends now.

I'd like work home office time well. Also I'd like place near home go work. expect corona we'll see empty malls filling rented cubicle space office away office. decade long remote worker, welcome club. Life without commutes wonderful. could look local co-working spaces perhaps go one 1-3 days per week get social interaction. we're covid bullshit. Although I'm 45 working remotely 15 years now. speak local language well. come upvote people post getting vaccinations. Yay you! read back work home equivalent bit 20% salary increase most.
 
I'd agree.  probably like 30% me, I'm already comfortable enough motivated money. 

I'm group quit returning full time office.
 
It's worth it. love work home, work much easier productive. distractions, bullshit, drop-ins wasting day without purpose productivity gained, needy extroverts standing desk talk half hour stuff really care about, stopping getting work done, commute,  getting early, lines coffee machine, lines bathroom.
 
I go back that. worth it. Started remotely last September, desire ever work office, flat told boss expected start commuting basically forcing pay cut me. feel desire ""in office"". work data science coding though team literally boss I. I've worked people before... I'd much rather left job 8 hours day spend extra time people actually want spend time with. ones insisting come back office, bet kids home make sorts noises screaming. mention people likely actually like kids.

Those parents ruining work home options rest us. Companies:

Fuck feel work office desk open high foot traffic, coworkers doors close, try work home much possible reason. Whether trying talk me, other, staff seem love gather near disrupt day, day. Although hybrid schedule best mentally sake keeping routine, least 4x productive home based factor alone. also avoid coworkers get openly mad don’t want spend whole day chit chatting dismissed rude constantly wearing headphones drown racket. likely Easter 2021

Nope. ole ole. know many friends getting vaccines like fully vaccinated. able go gas station without mask first time year great. think people making health choices. us antibodies vaccinations, things look pretty much normal. work better home less distractions. numbers sky rocketed office. seems likely places fans allowed minimal COVID restrictions compliance begin with. immune system robust still take vaccine? I’m young healthy. Problem countries high vaccine confidence takes longer get vaccine. places like Texas less people vaccine confident, offer vaccine everyone much quicker could U.K. whole ""pandemic over"" makes lol. cry. either opening 100% want lockdowns go forever. wait one fucking month. Two outside.

I've using analogy clamping hard sphincter front door shitting pants almost bathroom. Jesus hold little bit longer hulk-smash thing. going stir crazy lack social interactions.

Why friends family pandemic over? Work friend's couch. Work cousin's spare room. expect co-workers source social interactions? Yeah, want live queens. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ limited experience Canadian unemployment programs, think try actively funnel jobs Market Basket, whatever is, come different background. imagine option quit job might be, hits older get. I'm serious, health consequences sleeping properly pretty scary, even feel fine younger years. Businesses deny service reason big list: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information. feel like employers wanting bring people back manager control insecurity. 

“Threats” employer culture one I’ve heard. Come on, culture corporations stink. treat everyone equally well that’s culture enough.

A lot managers seem bit extroverted me, might going nuts home. Also hook team performance probably reduces anxiety people within grasp.

We really evolve model get work done. I'll curious see attitude changes age. I'm sure huge reason dad stayed pat three kids mortgage. Making change point life could HUGE ramifications made mistake, blame playing safe.

My responsibilities wayyyy less intense. Sure, need rent money, always move somewhere cheaper kids, I'm able save money (I could live savings year point to).

It'll interesting see job history starts looking like take serious commitments. probably ask ID likely give you. current vaccines tested anyone age 16. Yeah issue isn’t physically working office, honest miss coffee walks coworkers, collaborating someone’s desk, able get response immediately person sitting two seats away, constant video chat checkins since boss walk desk see you’re actually working.

What don’t miss losing hours life per day commuting. Yes, like people say make $120k mention live Silicon Valley pay $5000/month rent. total spliff aware long-term effects Covid shown? lethal dosen't mean cause several problems Anecdotal, heard recent Mariners game, fans packed light rail stadium game. surprised hear least spread came pre/post match activities including travelling developers want get money lot purchased. Rent control isnt gonna suddenly make lots cheaper encourage developers build lower income housing. goal isn’t stop spread, it’s limit systems don’t collapse. That’s always major goal. friend actually got second desk work computer. roll-top.

When day closes laptop literally rolls cover top work computer, notebook, everything else work related.

Sometimes get less physical separation ""an entirely separate building"". guy dressed death walking along beach sending message sparse crowd sun bathers. It’s akin saying “the CDC never going tell binge drinking okay!” course aren’t, isn’t good you. still it, course doctors aren’t going say it’s okay. op troll sub day try kick anti CDC anti-science messaging. Look post history, misinformation. you’re ugly say that. new, 34% remote workers answered survey. college announced today 90% classes fall remote, including science labs. state great vaccinations—I see logic all. Mine super easy, showed hundreds people line, went really fast everyone 6 feet apart looked longer was, like 50 people giving shots. fun atmosphere, music playing, balloons, lots volunteers directing people. shot took like 3-4 minutes. Easy peazy. hybrid schedule would best option people

I completely disagree.

Pre-pandemic wanted work top tech company, needed live ridiculously overpriced Bay Area (or one number similar overpriced cities company big enough multiple offices).

During pandemic, wanted work top tech company, could live anywhere world, long good connectivity.

A ""hybrid schedule"" even single day office would mean move back Bay Area. difference 0 days office 1 day office huge, means live within commute distance job.

Remote work completely decouples live job is. live wherever friends family live, work wherever jobs are. form ""hybrid"" WFH plan means live job based.

Sure, things need improved WFH. people adapt living space never designed WFH WFH suddenly emergency. Many companies remote workers switch 100% remote. So, pandemic experience could bit preparation planning.

Also, normal times ""working remotely"" mean working house spouse also works house kids try learn remotely everyone terrified deadly pandemic.

In normal times ""working remotely"" could working coffee shop, working friend's house, working co-working space use get house.

Most companies failing hard social front. home ""office"" setups terrible. Nobody's able take advantage working buddy's place, we're socially isolating.

I think hybrid awful, basically commuting work less frequently. Remote work much better, almost nobody chance wee remote work really first experience deadly global pandemic everything went shit. paying space work in? It’s them. best aren’t paying utilization. likely paying upgrades space working space minimum. could work office 4 days week. able get ore done office. understand it’s many. answer question like didn’t do: increased costs, related working home? never spend time home sleep office? purposely move extra space “office space”? latter would considered luxury, since don’t need specific room work, WANTED specific room work. I've begging remote work time. pandemic first hit went full remote people who's job worked way freaking AMAZING. Even old people complain make call type email ended loving it. management declared pandemic May havent gotten anywhere asking remote days per month. CEO even acknowledged business going way declines allow it. 
I'm definitely looking. Unless siblings kids, is, haha. went school 14th st. Getting around pretty easy, expensive AF. 1) really meaningful apply State's database across board interstate travel going every state handling things differently.

2) may doubt it, reality accepting paper card proof vaccination already done (e.g. yellow fever card traveling countries Africa). I'm sure companies invested huge office complexes buildings difficult scenario in. think WFH way future jobs done via internet. it'll curious see happens commercial real estate big cities like Seattle, SF on. decision makers quietly ride shit save lives figure people choice. 

The President literally took Amtrak train day working Senator. Could email.

Rage. fair, many outdoor activities pretty inaccessible weren’t raised financial situation them. record, classes city - often cost several hundred several thousand dollars participate in. Totally. climb several get car.

Oh..wait, no, less fine, least good expect given literal global pandemic. quite frankly, I'm glad live many places. kids missed entire year school fear. Yeah that’s you’re going wrong. You’ve decided turn pandemic nationalism spread xenophobic views. that’s gets going I’d rather challenge conspiracy theory pandemic, use support bigotry you’ve chosen do. Nope. I’m extremely introverted prefer going office 5 days week. need something force get ready leave house. appropriate amount coronavirus information consumed last year, according you? Keep dream alive! England haven’t deployed yet Wales has. Wales however significantly reliant AZ moderna England due less dense population. Where’s person vaccinated pretty rural Wales generally. 
Typically West go Wales remote like going office much personally pretty easy hit standard deduction, don't, anything miss anyway. think misinformation, widely held opinion CDC. Read comments see upvotes. guys got stay home? new cases, hospitalizations deaths declined peaks January, new infections increased plateauing. progress reducing new cases stalled, hospitalizations leveled deaths remain near average 800 day, according New York Times average number new cases reached nearly 65,000 day, Tuesday, concentrated mostly metro areas Michigan well New York City region. That’s 19 percent compared figure two weeks ago. quit current job force go office.

I’d willing go office FAANG job though really office, everyone pretty much busts ass day. They'd quickly weeded they'd never keep up. Yeah, separately get social interaction. someone like me, ridiculously hard time making friends all, yet alone coworkers pretty consistently completely indifferent best, kind dream. get avoid things hate (I like people, surrounded coworkers particularly care rather depressing) get social time husband visiting family. I'm introvert, social needs relatively easy fill. honestly find digital interactions clients students fulfilling person ones, anyways.  /u/Westfast Mind DM you? question time Try talking more? That's easy answer hypithetical practice, staring barrel income would stay bad them? Lmao people crazy covid gotta love living country relatives 65 either astrazeneca vaccinated all. fucking zero choice. subreddit told EU making up. make difference, anything substantial either. keep getting mad spend money stuff guess lol Thanks! actually look forward daily comments! allow force back in? working remotely several months ur job fine, wouldve requested stay wfh. Oh stay home move middle management woe me. Yeah fun eventually losing job overwhelming majority us adults vaccinated July 4 move lives. know I'm going  don’t know things panned people transitioned on-site remote. imagine humanizing benefits real-world experiences people zoom calls.

I started new job company that’s always remote, I’m finding nature makes prone much intense level politics.

There far opportunities play backroom games phone calls 1-on-1 zoom calls everyday thing. communications without records witnesses with. On-site, make concerted effort establish relationship speak someone level privacy.

Also, people feel lot like voices head images screen actual human beings. There’s weird paradox higher level intimacy lower level humanization. Usually would agree - want kids, them. think that's implies though. think unreasonable expected able work space separate children, distracted frustrated arrangement that's longer reality. hobby riding ridiculous miles bike racing grouchy old men spandex. worried even mild case would take bite lung capacity. Nobody say whether would come back. focus studies etc. return normal function. would non-significant someone keeps couch floating away hobby might noticeable someone 2 sigma cardiovascular fitness like me.

So I've super careful past year. Yea intend go back office full time ever UK reported rates anywhere close Norway, obviously causes yet identified I'm Montana...lots companies choose us pay like shit pretend they're helping communities building here. office year. remotely log work PC, can't even use cam zoom meetings, one seen face since last March. fine, currently look like Robin Williams Jumanji. sleep apnea midday nap vital me. 10 years working remotely, single manager ever issue knew I'd come back alert ready get things done. 

On visits main office, kind enough set beanbag could catnap well. 

Accommodating employees' needs results far happier team motivated actually productive. This. you’re happy pay company treats well stable? Stick out. 

But not? Hippity-hoppity, I’m employer’s property. least rona!!!! person responded likely talking k-12 college students. k-12, last months filled many testing days following spring break , combined allure summer close, kids shut mentally time every year. misread comment, thanks pointing out. I’ll delete comment. voted Trump huge margin, based primarily pandemic response. think counts something No. Hybrid: whiteboard session week, discuss important topics/projects week, work home rest week. Best worlds. packed train assumed normal way living.

You're considered entitled wish accept arrangement in/around NYC.  one deleted threads mod posted comment: types links posted Daily Discussion thread comment.


As such, keep providing daily vaccine update post thread, unless mods tell otherwise past year pandemic vast majority people limited house. Even state strict regulations Cafés restaurants operating half capacity people can't stick around work. libraries also enforcing social distancing reducing capacity half more. would simple go spend day working library challenge reduced capacity. factor behind preferring office could setup one has, 2 monitors, full size keyboard, desk dedicated work (no mixed hobby personal stuff lying around), etc. libraries Cafés limited laptop single small screen cramped keyboard. agreed, would okay hybrid zero interest going back full time 5 days week Omg scary  UK variant seems destined lose group stage. old UK variant, article avout better title submitted, better upvote one. heck 25% want return office full time

Parents. brazil vaccinating already. 20+ million people received one dose, 5+ received both. campaign speeding lately.   Probably none. keep self delusion that? entomologist? Personal anecdote, first shot Covid rough, second shot zero side effects. wife way too.  find mostly people children significant others want get away Honestly, miss friends work. miss enough go 5 days week, maybe 2. consider introvert remoteness even difficult me. economy going destroyed pandemic matter what. Lockdowns least spread number people flooding ICUs hospitals longer period time would *fewer deaths*. like businesses evolved care much profits employees.

Part stock market, public companies pressured maximize profit everything else.

Part ease learning online, employee replaceable knowledge easily accessible (of course goes certain point talent takes bigger role, point pretty far many people, continue shift automation software make jobs menial) someone uses dark mode everything, photo article idea personal hell  large congregation people always provide better job opportunities rural living. US rural areas even internet speed support work home.   talking Ontario here, socialized medicine CAD 14/hr minimum wage. Wanting quit financial freedom quit two totally different worlds. Pre covid going 2 days week, thing colleagues.

I would love go twice week get socialize co-workers.

Then again, colleagues love never go in, find kind depressing though. think there’s definitely benefits office work, although college student I’ve never experienced “real” job. feel like 2-3 days week office people interact would nice, WFH much convenient “The authors study submitted Lancet concede research shows two events — games fans increasing positive Covid-19 rates — coincided. events like political rallies, reopening colleges holiday travel may contributed increase infections, especially states preventive measures like wearing masks less widely adopted. Infections may also increased fans watched games friends living rooms bars, gatherings beyond N.F.L.’s control.”

So could NFL games. could things. Also cases rising across country going on. Thanks response! think lurker may way potential pandemics there. really hope genome earliest cases different countries find going on. Like random child Italy December? going on? doubt people studying next 50 years. question you. healthy 33 yr old pre-existing conditions absolute risk reduction mortality vaccine provide me? Also 3 vaccines FDA approved? finally, telling someone consider risk telling take zero risk. asking aware risks. Make informed decisions. change point life could HUGE ramifications made mistake, blame playing safe.

Definitely thing. Didn’t blink eye first several job changes since didn’t many serious responsibilities work home. 

That changed last job move. way stressful lot bills pay much higher expectations job. see mask mandates lifted year especially California Yep - it’s like saying chances dying pregnancy x 7 billion, half 7 billion men. Misleading. give shit less people choose spare time. said, showing interview stank pretty bad look. certain point, yeah. senior developer (for example), way ""up"" move management. means get love anymore. I'm fine passing higher salary exchange that.  someone changes ""immunity lasts 6 months"" ""immunity lasts *only* 6 months"", completely different meaning, happens nonetheless... far better would say ""immunity lasts entire 6 month period studied"". Damn that's double car payment Definitely eight universities point—I know one made local news, likely others. plan obligations (kids, family, etc.) could retire work. could any, course impact everyone (or likely anywhere near majority).

It may also increased case vaccine pretty noticeable side effects - sick often impacts cycles, surprise symptoms vaccine would same. vaccines less common side effects might see frequency disruption. transitioned working home temporarily go back office 3 days per week i’m looking fully remote position. 

between commuting deal getting ready, dressing up, deal packing lunch, making awkward small talk office mates... don’t want anymore

plus productivity immensely  people decided would *definitely* asymptomatically spread Covid vaccination, despite science merely saying definitive proof either way? 

You can't blame scientists. personally blame media for...""creatively"" covering stories shifting words around headlines mislead. Like literally saw headline read ""immunity lasts 6 months."" lie, omitting serious context Comment replied deleted, it’s true reactions characteristic immune response it’d misleading imply levels reactions normal vaccines. vaccines we’ve received throughout life generated sufficient immunity without giving recipients fever/chills/fatigue. immunogenicity lipid envelope translated spike, entire reason companies like $MRNA transitioned using tech vaccines rather gene therapy multiple repeated doses aren’t well-tolerated. people even try remote entire last year. time got promotion new department company. asked go office 3 days week 40 minute drive way. fucking blows. love company applying position place closer home mighty tempting. would take 5 days office 5 minute commute 3 days 40 minute commute. wore mask followed instructions Korea. 

I never caught basically lived life normally minus hanging people. mask. Made vaccination. cases start going soon herd immunity reached. mean keep way impact throughput not. probably willing work you. Might come occasional meeting.

Just miss warning signs looks like may replace favor someone coming in. also used phrase ""will taken,"" which, like said, we're yet. conversation people vaccinated, minimum everybody wants shot get one.  Probably, yes. Depends state. Yeah, last company policy raises. way got pay increases years promotions, course policies allowing pay increase small percentage promotion. Dicks. finally bailed made double old salary half work. loyalty me. percentage salary goes living commute expenses? unemployment paying better lot jobs. sometimes cost babysitting employee would need work higher pay would be. schools go back boosted unemployment ends, people might start working again. Mine even less physical that. use regular desktop connect work via Citrix. soon shut Citrix window I'm back looking normal desktop full games work gone, haha. Three months chest pain improving still there.
I 90-100+ bpm heart rate rest much higher moved, heard nurses doctors normal high heart rate sick LOLOLOL..had get rid myself...took months. Winder study says people working normally (I work casino back work since end May.) Moral work pretty much rock bottom. Everyone feels overworked hates ""new norm"" corona created. getting tested coronatest.nl many times throughout pandemic various reasons - never problems. Test done professionally, never pay, gotten results back within two days every time. It’s completely doable. Stop double mutant crap. EVERY strain mutated multiple times. 'double mutant' nonsense term coined media induce panic hysteria. currently proof lethal proof eliminates vaccine protection. American here, relate. Ok. first. really hard Game devs certain scale collaboration Iteration time needs fast. It’s weird me. Get life OUTSIDE work. It’s amazing. Work fun socializing great, that’s form it, well, you’re gonna bad time lol. us live big cities really expensive. real pensions still thing, would give *some* pause leaving. would stay job completely hated company treated poorly, kind bored mildly unhappy (the case 3 4 job moves), would harder leave money table. bad like blue collar work. Moving new companies means bottom totem pole seniority means shifts getting shit jobs I've seen people suggest things like go walk something get house logging off. kind feels like commute, allows brain switch gears work home. working remote 6 months last year. Logged off, shut everything down, took walk 15 minutes. course, depends live comfortably take walk right now. Seriously. Covid December wasn’t sporting event, restaurant, maskless (or even masked!) gathering etc. funny one trace back anyone/place cases (eye roll). choice people make can't afford live closer work. usually luxury.  J&amp;J least comparable AZ. thank insurance companies  Austria basically ignoring pandemic. one goes people said working home dealing isolation bad working grocery store people pull masks spit bologna order me. developed vaccine, surely possible Yeah 400$/month including joy owning car+insurance NJ, + 200$/month incidentals like coffee food ""brown bag not"" come up.

I still liked traveling working live events, I'm gonna 'til pandemic long gone, nowhere near much before. Exactly this. I’ve also heard heard seen poor talent since one poached you.

For starters, parents letting kids aren’t always people practice personal protection strategies.

Even bubble would take adults widespread transmission. something can...get onboard with. :) June 15. June 18 11?

Picking date two months seems pretty arbitrary. Whats new ""rule 9 data trackers"" ??

So many people come subreddit exact posts. subreddit tracking thing for? yet reason (other scary name) think it’s worse, vaccines won’t effective! I'm one them, want things back normal, want us rush things we're close thanks vaccines. pretending US millions doses AstraZeneca vaccine stockpile? freakonomics say? Number one confidence number 21 - 25 logic wild ride headline. People scared. Realistically, majority people browsing sub often—myself included—are white collar types. work home computers, supervise kids school activities, time resources find active enrichment weekends. us, find workarounds issue.

But that’s case families. long families fine, don’t care families. fact, we’d prefer suffer long maintains sense security. It’s also worth mentioning isreal “green pass” system basically vaccine passport businesses much relaxed don’t even check. point (hopefully when) cases fall enough people won’t care. issue may quickly become moot. news done disservice explaining variants CDC/Fauci going need clear air likelihood even possibility variant render vaccine useless. ""throw decent dummy"" mean? queued 2 hours get it, like people US want seems bizarre countries even talking stricter lockdowns vaccinations available. Masking still makes sense lockdowns seem weird right now.  8-10 hours later. case, using argument, barely lived there?  non-medical opinion, would get second dose AZ. (Since mention, yet studies mixing) clotting issue appears extremely rare, believe leading theory sort auto immune system reaction. Since issue first jab, seems unlikely second! (Once medical authority) eu getting need. UK getting, EU. EU 2nd trickle moment They're using Pfizer, AZ, J&amp;J. Sinovac also much less demand. Chile smart enough order millions doses different manufacturers early on.   
  That’s Chile hedged bets signing contracts many manufacturers possible, often safety efficacy data became available, volunteering host clinical trials. strategy paid off: Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson hook deliver millions doses. Millions coming Chinese maker Sinovac, seen less demand vaccine lack transparency around well half many ""credible sources"" bend facts drive narrative. cruise without kids sounds fantastic Well, mostly lot people US refuse get vaccines. That’s case Germany, lot people want vaccine. 

There even run Astrazeneca- even negative press! see almost every younger friend mine recovered covid. Either lung damage heart damage severe fatigue otherwise healthy people. friends recover within week major symptoms. unpredictability virus one scariest things me.  happened Emergent actually good thing. increase drastically production J&amp;J vaccine. US anyway enough AZ doses stockpiled. 100% agree. I’m worried people STILL saying need masks come July anyone wants vaccine get vaccinated. really believe people never want end. wearing mask little protect yourself. Everyone needs everyone wear mask affective. vaccine lack close zero impact anyone vaccine. vaccine available everyone, it’s everyone’s responsibility protect themselves. news sky blue What? Drinking bleach doesn’t help?! Crazy... Okay nice, favorite Old Bay hard hearing person deaf community, make non-verbal communication harder. don’t put effort finding masks/ways wear work them. easy solutions problems. feel many points. also think masks cool accessories common like bags fake glasses ppl used wear looks. 10 days? talking it’s time people start worrying big new scary variant; found here, don’t know vaccines hold it; there’s use worrying right general public. NC checking in. 

Our governor “worst worlds”; massive amount anti-mask/anti-vax people massive amount progressive people. he’s stuck fucked median trying keep sides content, etc. administration set guidelines (building capacity limits, full shut down, etc.) empowered county enforce rules. large, counties right thing, plenty counties continue operate virus isn’t real.

I get second shot Saturday - cannot wait go eat see movie again! Upper west side what?

I going assume they're referring Columbus, Ohio, live. Oh cut potatoes bake em oven custom seasoning Real talk—where kids supposed work gyms team sports closed?

I don’t see don’t expect obesity uptick kids we’ve shut 90% avenues work out. avenues left without gyms group sports? Running, body weight exercise, hiking, socially distanced sports like golf tennis. impossible live city can’t get regular transportation. ten year-old isn’t going go take jog.

It’s “obesity card.” Obesity massive public health talking point COVID, apparently we’ve forgotten now. Kids dying COVID super rare—I believe latest stats said COVID killed around 200 kids, half much typical flu season. ruining kids’ long-term health making obese? last time walked elementary school, shocked number overweight kids. 
Aaaawww ! I'm fine two months people chance. opened 18+ Monday county next mine immediately dropped requirement. I'm saying wait couple months give people chance get vaccine drop it. Well buy frozen fries already fried factory once. I'm office right hated wfh. lockdown became tremendously isolated weeks seeing zero people meaningful interactions.

I'm exception real commuting (I live like 10m office), living alone pets lockdown awful wfh isolation top it.

If still lived family long commute could totally see value though. always take number people multiple time. 1 hour, 10 us. 10 man hours used. 10 man hours put toward project time trackers. Warning guidance enough, need actual, enforceable policies going get US. Yeah that's huge difference. counselors, teachers, admin etc actually sit kids say ""hey let's work right now"" ""how help you"" LOT better \*never goes zoom/doesn't answer calls\* Cleveland State well, least live campus Idk wish could work remote shitty company doesn’t offer it, they’d rather die. Anyway guess I’m opposite, don’t want see co-workers. I’d miss boss that’s it. work better home don’t feel need know co workers. I’m get paycheck, nothing more. call 'herding Tribbles pitchfork'. Much happier *actual* work. think word ""patients"" title alone gives away fact linking contradict Study part prospective cohort study long-term follow-up, enrolled consecutively patients diagnosed COVID-19 period March – May 2020, first wave pandemic Bergen, Norway. study population included SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive outpatients diagnosed Bergen Municipality Emergency Department, admitted two neighbouring city hospitals, Haukeland University Hospital Haraldsplass Deaconess Hospital.

It conducted *patients* admitted hospital, quote even clarifies ""higher risk"" category mentioned.

You're ignoring vast majority infected individuals 60 healthy BMI ranges chronic lung heart disorders, typically admitted. Yeah fair enough thought so, frustrating things like gossip post referencing remain top front page hours they're based fact, proved wrong harmful general opinion AZ vaccine. 

It though, certainly can't find annoyed mods roles free try improve subreddits judging people choosing stay locked they're vaccinated? goes ways. 

Do whatever want vaccinated. stick company advice reminds Jim Gaffigan joke survive bear attack.

""who came this, bears? 'stand still, make sudden moves, try run away ~~us~~ mean *the bears*."" Thank you. calling name again, I'm pushing back. gets hard month (much like abstinence). mean, can’t really compare situations since 1). vaccines open almost anyone wants 2). I’m sure mask compliance better then, even despite mandate lifted. 

It’s really 1:1 situation. Moderators believe know people want see better masses, apparently useless ability up/down vote posts. simple flair/filter system needed prevent topic saturation.

Seems trend many subreddits. Probably getting ready EU deliveries starting 19th. might waiting vaccines fully approved, since requiring EUA vaccine legally dubious. afraid stay home ut businesses closing left right reducing employees due cutbacks.

The thing 6 months ago, many jobs jobs available mostly sucked. seriously changed last months. 

I think unreasonable require job search now. permanent, children eventually vaccinated sooner rather later. still possible, suppose true herd immunity end year include children. source? 3rd G20 per capita doses administered.. I’ve done first class British airways Ohare LHR. Still bad. time I’ve ever plane said “I can’t another bite, I’m full “ similar survey - One single solitary person like 350 said wanted go back office full time. We're quest find person try understand why. 6-4/5 (lunch optional), 4 times week. it’s noice huge. way close someone messed badly. Yup!! explained office job performance went stayed consistent work performance since working remotely. 

My managers happy tell. me.. told mental health better I’m overall much happier employee person. Plus allows keep son home too. He’s 2. 

So asked stay remote. even offered come 2x week said I’m happy staying home continue job well stay home!! 
Yay 😁

Edit:one word hell would want waste 2 hours day just...driving exactly everything need couch? -also- get laundry done. Screw going office need to, man. worst thing winter brazil really winter may think, sometimes beaches get crowded like summer Hockey players? blows mind differently companies reacted this.

 one work immediately saw savings operate facility announced shortly change permanent they'd shifting much smaller office accommodate things still need physical location for.

On hand, friends company can't seem wait get everyone back office despite performance general productivity going since shifted temporary WFH, even telling there's almost reason physical location point.

I guess people see winds changing better others. entirely. depends occupation entails. Brainstorming/whiteboard sessions sometimes pop-out nowhere development cycle. Since business requirements may change, nasty bug discovered need find solution quickly. Sometimes scenarios don’t require huge white boarding session, sometimes it’s something two devs one solve. happens one WFH? We’ll adapt something like happens. 

Point is, think depends lot work is. it’s quarterly meeting set date, yah argument made one day specifically office . constantly changing work environment , it’s simple. everyone lives populated cities. hire medical practice. getting 50%+ shows interviews. even call day remind them. Still show.

I one job posted scheduled 4 interviews. One showed up, hired default.

It's wild there. people show interview apply next open position, forgetting showed weeks before. God hope never go back. I’m saving ton time money, I’m less stressed, even back hurts less. current office mates pure nap break, ones office try get buy MLM.

I wonder makes 66% want go back.... Sounds like jealousy. Plenty software engineers working home believe includes 45 million 2nd dose shots need Yes many kids shut severely hut us variable tge concern way worse usual. why?  great. comments way depressing young extrovert disagree Taking back what's ours. reasonably-healthy people

Physically maybe, mental health weaker wet toilet paper.  real problem people commuting work fuck ton people unemployed. Billions upon billions different industries rely solely movement people. commuters? rail industry. rail industry? stations. stations? shops. cars road. traffic. goes on. Thanks, bookmarked! Hard legally require still EUA.

When fully-approved, expect change. cody rigsby get smaller stuff, lot smaller capacity masks. bigger full tours pushed 2022. festival working pushed 2023. military's adenovirus vaccine pill form. side effects include explosive diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain  ""UK Variant""

Isn't saying racist British, Irish, Scottish peoples? necessary certain location majority jobs conversation husband last night. coworkers married / dual income. soon spouse got furloughed, even pay power bills go right credit limit constantly.

&amp;#x200B;

They put things like medical visits care credit, yet buy new iphones take vacations.

They live paycheck paycheck.

It doesnt make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

We live fairly frugally, nice house, nice cars 4yr old, replace things broken like phones, computers laptops, buy quality stuff never breaks, take vacations etc. yet zero debt outside 15 year $200k mortgage 185k left 750k house. 401k + mega backdoor roth maxed / IRA maxed HSA maxed. still $ left throw odd end investing end month. Yeah I've 1 dose already, 2nd couple weeks. Still vaccine passports. call UK variant one going start going around beating British people that. made furloughed second time November, heading peak virus area hospitals full capacity. 

I work restaurant result closing indoor dining wanted apparently go apply Amazon, walmart, mcdonalds middle raging pandemic, rather receive unemployment weeks. pay cut factor hours spend commuting, gas drive, train pass use public transport etc. adding travel time expenses onto week additional pay.

If used make $20 hour worked home 40 hours work+commute 50 hours pay. drops $16 hour job. guilty thanks. definitely know people like that. I'm one them, lol Man, thinking today tell us return I'm going looking remote job. got new boss, already tell he's old school, wants everyone office. Fuck that. Yeah big enterprises really great this. Shit move within department work people I’ve never even met

Of course know salary going wanted it’s still you’d get annual raise. 

That said 3 year span left company came back turned $45k raise. Much different role lot responsibilities still.  may make clear.

My monthly wage 500 hundred bucks excluding money get credit card exclusively food, lunch, groceries consumables purchases. flex power.  wonder I'm problems contacting proctologist... he's moonlighting. commute 2 hours way. COVID best thing that’s ever happened me. Subways, yeah pretty cheap. Trains, cheap all. LIRR metro north run MTA neither cheap. get city expensive gets. 

The single round trip cost ride around $40.  large group, maybe 50%, deeply want return office.

Man, I'd love know real breakdown 50%. many prefer focus office increase productivity facility reasons, many want avoid home (i.e. can't concentrate home due interruptions, family, distractions) regardless efficiency, many want able shoot shit co-workers kill time/be social/extrovert. defeating argument. cities need rely large concentration workers close proximity anymore.

And joke internet speeds proves ignorance topic. 

Urban decay big story next decade, watch. least let go home lunch work home there. go home eat healthy meal work I’m really glad stopped working company sold hardware office environments. company straight died last year due WFH. 

I honestly looking jobs WFH. ive like three tell jobs really safe one open work environment walls five day week schedule office. thanks. don’t know could work productive 9-5 (remote on-site) staying touch friends beyond handful texts/calls/emails.

So, clarity, seems like way worded applied even pre-Covid-19 world. says friends job, can't time friends. think that's intended message trying convey.

I agree getting ""Discord something"" half-ass solution. thing got though. know talk anyone pandemic(aside texts such) picked headset recently, found servers chat in. might considered anecdotal evidence, kind access to, know of. Never chance ride ""Their first class"" suites, get fly DOH LHR 2019 one A350s ""Q-suite"" friggin' awesome. Probably best business-class hard product I've ever personally experienced. service also fantastic. gripe pre-departure alcoholic drinks DOH. live nine miles job. I’m fortunate commute mostly back roads old neighborhoods, really quite pretty, never taking longer 30-40 minutes. also nice office space 7th floor great working conditions wonderful view mountains distance. go days week, could occasionally work home long talked boss it, needing contractor house, doctors appointments, leaving customer meeting didn’t make sense drive back office, etc. rudimentary work home setup laptop didn’t often. 

I haven’t office year. Although desire go every day again, would definitely like go two three times week, especially lots work need collaborate people. I’m pretty fed cats crawling day, quiet mornings desk room wife I’s bedroom often sleeps past 10am, generally never leaving house. also find way tempting get distracted looking phone, watching tv, taking extended lunch, work late make weekend fucking workday. Hell, I’m right respond post! 

This doubt exacerbated pandemic, would welcome opportunity see co-workers person separating work home life. Disagree. Setting context important. tell flesh eating disease without first explaining Frickin rare is. is.

When spend time money getting work compensation package remains unchanged, balance I'm giving vs. I'm getting changes. see covid death rate continues drop US, theres single news article mentions 🤔 Yeah mean kids desire work startup negative zero. want know job stable. Can’t handle “sorry guys we’re funding effective now. fun!” I'm trying one now, would love normalize ""office hours"" instead regular 40 hours site.

It's ridiculous substantial hit quality life what, people walk desk ask things could email? people schedule zoom meetings?

Like depending commute plus home lunch that's like 5-10-15 hours life every week luxury hassling desk. That's absurd. I've spoiled seeing dog taking walks lunch every day. It'd hard go back 5x week office. Thank detailed description vaccination efforts prospects country. certainly hope everyone's sake goes smoothly hiccups like Emergent ruining 15m J&amp;J doses US, that's great news Pfizer. US, states varied eligibility requirements promoted essential workers vaccination schedules. SA strictly age-based promoting preexisting conditions, also consideration type employment? plan visiting first Cape Town, Joburg, Kruger, would take flight Botswana short side trip returning Joburg. I'm sure situation Botswana, looks like AZ vaccine there. Hi. Maybe unfamiliar current vaccines. 1 250,000 develop multisystem organ failure yellow fever vaccine. risk noted it, however many people even aware it. considered failure/fuckup?

Think absolute momentuousness creating vaccine saves millions people, reacts poorly immune system small segment. Despite fact every person different, everyone responds differently elements. failure.

Brazil right 4000 deaths DAY. 2000 deaths 65,000 infections day. much changed? oh wow, that’s helpful thank you! place work, lot departments used work remotely Fridays, usually one people chartered bus took work day.

After pandemic really hope allow people work remotely least one day week, sucks spend two hours day commute work, considering company able hire people states thanks home office, surprised make permanent. Would rather quit. Can't though go back full time June 1. Big boss completely opposed kind continuing work home. going suck. mention dogs used it. going hell time getting used change.

Absolutely absurd gamble assume COVID unique complications post infection, ""feel"" case. I'm implying need indefinite lockdowns tectonic shift

People made sorts frankly stupid assumptions desperately wanted COVID overblown leftist conspiracy. started Donald Fucking Trump... Fox News. Why?

Well things cost less dollar, person mask fits them.

My wife, there’s one 3M mask wear, something found buying hundred masks Americans ever heard covid.

Fit isn’t big deal someone ICU intubating covid patients, hospitals going risk hard get ICU staff unknown masks point. rather pony get 3M masks. least case wife’s former hospital, new hospital (bailed region refused mask up, wife got tired working 80 hour weeks full floors seeing parties drive home). mean isolated we’ve kids I’m 100% sure kids (1 &amp;3) haven’t exposed Covid. figure exposure anything resembles part sarscov2 may something. knows though. It’s free even 2% benefit (whatever would mean) not. 

I’ve limited exposure Covid work sure statistically stores I’m sure I’ve around lot Covid(but kept distance worn n95 masks) prior Moderna shot gave blood negative antibody test. 

Funny thing family (including distant relatives we’ve page precaution wise). Despite living 6 states many us working multiple hotspots active waves 48 51 us haven’t gotten Covid. 3 got one congregate care elderly couple got last March masks distancing really even recommended thing. Sadly 3 got 2 died. One 80s (the husband couple) 50s (died November congregate care setting w/ special needs). 

My observation part disciplined enough don’t wear anything less n95 mask mostly avoid Covid. biggest rule, circumstances swap air anyone indoors that’s bubble.  10 minutes 10 feet. indoor air people’s lungs outside family go lungs n95 mask. Youdontsay article say Chile used mostly Sinovac.

""...the bulk vaccinations Chile Sinovac. According Chilean Ministry Finance, 3 March country taken delivery 10 million Sinovac doses 700,000 Pfizer Bingo! exactly said US cases fell cliff February/March...”everyone complying masking distancing...it’s miracle!”. cases started going immediately reverted “we would fine wasn’t damn kids!” Shoutout lady cursed sidewalk San Francisco jogging without mask! hope find way make fe like good person. Sorry sound like I'm generalising Americans ignorant things. dare want society whole begin go back normal. selfish me. everyone ignored said real.

EU: 446M guys ever stop think hopeless bleak situation looked time last year? even 6-7 months ago? It’s insane feel optimism feel shift. I’m excited go Disneyland enjoy much hate crowds like never before. popular thing last summer released study cited “dining out” problem never specified outdoor indoor. Well, outdoor dining banned San Francisco December 2020 until, think, February 2021 Oh yes, spend hour every week trying plug relative/friend's conspiracy theory (I see lot Facebook, love spread WhatsApp too), hope I'm nipping bud. never seems end. professionals seems little effect volume trash post (just different topics). (it ""pressure"" pain barely there. cleared day. news gets better everyday. jobs people want one. big one caused biggest fight risk reinfection, data clear shows short term (less year) statistically zero. Covid recovered pointed rush get vaccine (note: refusing get one, going jump line cheat get early, I'm getting jab Friday), ganged like demon fool.

They also scared several basic things. One (the educated among us, years schooling) literally afraid leave house ANYTHING, point reluctant even go doctor, even though good shape, young, knows take precautions. literally step beyond front porch weeks time (another note: fall, long months info Covid). 

When active Covid quarantine, audacity use non-contact curbside pickup groceries. fully masked sitting car windows closed Walmart people put food car could actually feed children. Zero contact, fully masks, windows shut, everything could possibly protect everyone involved still getting groceries. demonized point nearly lost friendship it, ""directly responsible making Covid worse"", despite everything power opposite (including two instances self quarantining testing **might** Covid, safe, months earlier). 

They watch CNN much deathly afraid irrational, almost bad side refusing wear masks calling hoax. Same. Congress first line get it. Though, truthfully, large percent probably high risk anyway due age.

I know DeBlasio get J&amp;J rolled thought surprisingly late well. Kids vaccinated yet, large unvaccinated group, younger kids likely approved vaccine months yet. kids school chance get vaccinated, schools require masks worn building. Take look street interview. Would get similarly thoughtful answers kind interview conducted United States?

Stateside started classes home school in-person lot restrictions size many online anyway. lot people know getting fatigued constantly Zoom calls day long student org run difficult time recruiting anyone new. possibility could infected Covid getting vaccine? ask mainly due statement can’t taste.

Right yes, month? 2 months?

No one arguing good faith thinks last pass mass vaccination, cost/benefit thing: get enough benefit right get system place, soon it'll pointless. much Americans Canadians. getting vaccinated, normal experience slight pain chest take deep breath? state run mass clinics NY. How’s blizzard thing? Easy say unemployment low, especially white collar work. Job hopping incredibly easy right now. Follow @stand.upx Instagram. You’ll see lots information Cringe. understand need put pants stuff public pantless comfort home... Especially typically less time home! I’ve heard many times new variant resistant vaccines don’t capacity care turns one actually is. know languages lol. I'm little surprised - really high! 

Of note, vaccination rates amongst hospital staff vary background. Physicians nurses pretty high uptake rates; rates others varied location.

There huge number employees healthcare, many direct indirect patient contact eligible vaccination. hospital included everyone long entered patients rooms spoke face face patients, schedulers, medical assistants, radiology techs, food service workers, maintenance, housekeeping etc.

As general population, see hesitancy tends vary education, rural vs urban background, race Former presidency* I'm neutral, I'm surprised see articles central Europe. Probably many small countries instead large one like Brazil. 

But Turkey, Czechia, Poland, Bosnia, many completely slammed bad Brazil so.  covid rapid heart rate freaked out. got shot thing freaked again. resting HR low 60s. I'm sleeping it'll fall 50s sometimes. covid hit 120 laying couch trying die. fatigue also sucked bad. would get go pee would exhaust I'd somehow summon strength get back bed. took least two weeks could get back running again. feel like slightly overweight (by BMI least) still somewhat fit running helped significantly. half find jobs outsourced cheaper country. naïve? 


You can't think way information could used track movements, buy, buy it...etc..? 


It's hackers, entire government agencies industry. unreasonable uncomfortable that. Worcester I’m headed source says danish authorities interpreted signs community spread Sweden earliest 14th, interpretation danish authorities separate FHM. countries west including Sweden started restricting general entry travel 14th March.

So realistically way prevent community spread entirely 14th first country west close general entry travel despite even danish authorities believing data proved community transmission sweden.

Sure strategy could different, point widespread community transmission 14th way close well 14th would get time machine. earliest designated virus pandemic Sweden first death 11th, point several days spring break ended 10% entire swedish population already abroad returned. Color surprised  


 \#NotSurprised January 2020? sure COVID? Confirmed PCR test that? Plus variants spread faster younger people animal study phase one humans even begun.

Really shameful news journalists scientifically illiterate, wonder people trust news media anymore. seem deeply confused freedom assembly true. Sure there's lot antivaxers, there's plenty people lining vaccine. We're close 4M daily vaccinations. hit plateau decline, would misleading say Americans want vaccine. Right now, demand outweighs supply. exactly it, can't leave day behind. hated traffic going home, listened favorite music nice I'd open windows enjoy drive weather. bad day I'd rant time city good go. Never thought I'd say miss commute... ""\[The survey\] involved 1,000 adult employees US companies, currently working home due pandemic ... mentioned above, 1 3 said would look new job work office full time."" hEy gUys TrUmP Everyone ashamed way media works consume 'information'. actual paper they're summarizing linked found bottom page download full PDF includes full data including colorful charts w/ teams/games. 
 
So reject hypothesis. I'm sick yokels see news stories cases increasing despite vaccine access think proof work. Hey dumbass, presence vaccines county magically confer immunity people vaccinated. asking? article says 100% vaccinated adults 18 up. mention children, know dangerous virus vector potentially part spread variants.

These cruises booked months -- announcement made week. tried book cruise June back January four staterooms available entire ship terrible rooms, pushed cruise date October. 

I'm guessing people either make sure get vaccinated ASAP cancel cruise plans, sure, average passengers books cruise 9-12 months ahead time. consolidation wealth top end Meanwhile Ontario teachers don’t matter. Two weeks past first moderna shot! It’s surreal feeling knowing close fully vaccinated Pity pandemic bankrupt companies think underestimating long certain states keep capacity distancing restrictions, even including extended period months mask requirements ability roll back earlier phase. view post history see pro open everything almost year. saying originally ordered many different vaccines case work seems possible they're ordering case short shelf life less death count, makes huge areas uninhabitable. Might problem USA unless something goes near major city like NYC. USA close moment three mile island. Fukushima close Tokyo, containment failed, Tokyo would history Prypriat nowadays!

Also dont underestimate extensiveness fallout. live central europe, Tschernobyl hit us indirectly raining fallout area well years cases thyroid related problems rose significantly. Due opening country loosening restrictions. Combine r number Covid 3 left alone spread population inevitably climb back peak August. various scenarios big spike August...but spike coming. 

Here source team University I’d break someone thought lacked critical thinking common sense. 

No way gonna continue path financially tying human. Spreading COVID misinformation like what? last statement rings true past year. fall? Almost certainly. Now? Probably not. cons outweigh pros now. cons risking spreading across community, parents adults, chance vaccinate. Remember that, open everyone (if is), mean everyone chance get it. pros? Classrooms open two months summer vacation. lives Hong Kong. lame sub. people whining US getting called guns, super legit concern. simple  world entire medical community conspiracy lockdowns perfectly happen line every time Covid handled well Canada, nothing fact lockdowns R.0 fallen dramatically cause falling cases. 

The entirety September-January wave Ontario - ended lockdown. coincidence, right? data coincidences best experts bought like morons? think step 1 helping people post-covid anxiety would firing headline writer forget CNN too. They're bad Fox News, except foot. too. read things agree already think. way fall trap. don’t think anybody’s gonna forcing anybody get sex change Yeah could new vaccine-resistant COVID variant so, back bunkers next decade. Vaccination much forward UK, Portugal already seeing rise cases since primary schools back two weeks. Bruh. MIL gets facebook memes third-hand like fucked game ideology telephone. She’s anti-vax course. kids board would assume That’s actually fair point. One thought before. think political capitol one. Neither party wants one party guaranteed roasted one. cry..? I'm pretty pissed I've gotten hear shit plague rats last year vaccines people like give fuck also. Jesus, know word 'caution' means? smart ass, think it'll armageddon. But, get this, things change rapidly, opening month vs time might bit smarter. Otherwise shit goes south get try get everyone follow restrictions again. Which, considering attitude around lately along dumbasses ignoring altogether, highly doubt we'll do.

And hey, know reading comprehension thing, I've stuck inside kid history respiratory issues. know screech ""Oh affect kids!"" yeah, can, parent I'm going gamble health selfish bullshit.

We told 2 weeks another month since beginning. kept extend fully grown adults handle piece cloth face. Get new line.

You're literally better egotistical shits last year pretending issue. Judging responses probably pretty safe bet one egotistical jackasses though. Hope friends family stay safe. It’s finding lot false misleading correlations 

Sorry, what? pneumonia *also* shown manifest neurologic complications acute cases mean baseless correlation. 

COVID deserves special attention put hell lot people hospital past year severe pneumonia typically does. got mods: - subreddit getting inundated kinds posts people using karma farm. going like last week temporarily switched sub another one got removed mods? week shut whole sub day? require masks encourage vaccinations. BBC completely ignoring standard convention measuring things relation Wales football pitches.

For clarity, UK vaccine rollout halfway centre line opposition's penalty box; alternatively prefer units Wales, roughly Brecon Beacons Snowdon. hope makes clear. allow thread new posts/threads allowed anymore. ones people actually want... Yet somehow UK one highest deaths per capita world. vaccination available enough. Israël country able reopen thanks vaccines, that's small country could overpay.

In Europe middle 3rd wave, reanimation capacities track overwhelmed within weeks. happens, deathcount increases dramatically (a person needs ventilation get it... Usually simply dies).

So wait vaccine deliveries, something avoid dramatic increase death. can't half-mesures see slow covid enough (especially new uk variant infections), know countries germany France mandatory masks inside, restaurants etc, 6 months, yet 3d wave.

So 2 options lockdown let people die. Covid worse TB deaths due Covid *despite* locked yet. imagine many deaths would *hadn't* locked down. work remote! get outsourced eventually. Whoa, yeah 4 hours life back overnight game changer. see it’s beneficial lot people. 

For me, lucky 25 min train ride could read, listen podcast, awhile learning another language. loved around people clear separation work home. 

It fucked first months pandemic. struggling adjust work home lines blurred. productivity dropped, worked longer hours struggled built new routine. didn’t get daily dose people energy too. I’m good job eventually adjust, still feel like I’m hanging days. 

I cannot wait go back. Maybe 5 days would love 3-4. Bathrooms problem cause touch surfaces 1/10,000 chance getting sick... chance. Food thing really sitting friends distanced.. Lol what? Oh know random redditor chargin guilt association!!! science really really simple. Keep people away other, transmission drops. Let gather again, transmission rises.

There course things going on, like seasonality vaccination, 'wave' effect might see dynamic system, however essence it. good news, governments *can* control pandemic, long get population comply necessary public health measures. Polling shows majority Americans want vaccine passports: days regular, normal life work undone. What? talking remember explaining mom 10 years ago, response, ""but would someone want trick me?"" dont know either, mom. Similar story uncle aunt. practising doctors. Well traveled educated. actually seen world used excited show us pictures travels talk wonderful people ... were. 

But completely bought rising right-wing bullshit. firmly anti-immigrant straight racist. Spewing ridiculous bullshit that's even applicable country, clearly US. Even dipped anti-Semitism, part family Jewish roots. 

And they're big Covid deniers. Trying tell grandma hoax wanting hug go such. luckily awesome shuts down. 

I basically stopped contact them, unbearable. siblings mother. Even brother (my father) barely talks anymore extremely close. strengthens twisted beliefs. Truly *Sad.* technically could be, given ""just say unpaid carer"" scam going around social media recently, NHS anything stop it, likely bending truth. genuine full-time carer, would've ages ago, conveniently waited became go-to way scam vaccine. do, however, make much easier humans attack humans. 

I understand China demanding foreign visitors accept Chinese developed mRNA jab epic national security failure mRNA experiment became obvious recent disclosure mRNA antibody response consistent, functional distinguishable natural antibodies produced exposure actual genetic material COVID. possible detect mRNA based antibodies COVID infection based antibodies circulating simultaneously single individual. 

An adversary lab develop targeted viruses utillize well-known antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) issue coronavirus antibodies accidentally target population who'd sick naturally took traditional virus material based vaccine. 

Going interesting see happens next 10-20 years biological warfare. get programmed released population terrorist group? adversarial nation state? evil genius much time, money lab space? could now. One will. nothing time inclination. thanks, went small concert bar yesterday! Going baseball game soon Seriously situation terrible here? someone also lives Germany London first lockdown get complaining about. UK still lockdown well. comparison, UK lockdowns strict German rules far. Germany lockdown want downplay restrictions still lot stuff. Sure discussions federal states German government often unproductive. However, looking actual numbers Germany handled pandemic comparably well metric (including economy, Dax, unemployment rate, deaths per capita etc.) Slow vaccination rollout also mainly blame astrazeneca EU. exactly complaining? never relaxed restrictions. would protected covid every potential future pandemic. Last checked, around 150 million people fully vaccinated worldwide roughly 400 million least 1 dose. evidence vaccine safe. see reason doubt diagnosis. they’re US, basically testing sickest folks time. OC’s son fits description, yes? Maybe, US largely service economy already. It’s lot harder outsource quality service work lower paying jobs, quality service work demands higher pay, otherwise people move on. 

Think lot high paying jobs work home: programming, banking, law, sales, etc. They’re service economy, they’re high paying they’re jobs based US, require talented individuals pay that. 

Sure, maybe competition become stiffer, you’re gonna see Google outsource AI work India, top law firms outsource analysts Thailand. Service economy jobs protected outsourcing sense lot skill involved high salaries, US higher minimum wages worker standards. “After taking account underlying health characteristics, age, sex, ethnicity existing health conditions, overall 44% greater risk neurological mental health diagnoses Covid-19 flu, 16% greater risk Covid-19 respiratory tract infections.” Please, take shots, take every follow-up shot every year. want people like happy, happy, happy. understand makes source credible. Mayo Clinic - credible, Fox News - much. Imagine caring fake internet points much.

If want prevent karma farming, set bot post daily? almost believable said rent free missing point (conservative) saying side wants that.

The real loser us thinking real say matters sides government pretend squabble like care us all. UBI mean ""non essential"" products would magically grow tree appear door.

Also, UBI rich people's wet dream. need public, free services state assistance programs. 400 euro, going disappear immediately rent utility bills, shut up.

It might comes surprise people want work, study, learn things, experience life feel useful. getting bills covered. basic human right. Osterholm carry torch ""Category 5 hurricane"" Walensky ""sense impending doom"". hybrid schedule would best option people

Agree 100%. Starting job remotely really sucks. on-boarded remotely year ago never met co-workers barely interact daily basis. would kill actual interactions people office.

I'm assuming people really enjoy remote work established roles years, friends, etc. damn tough start fresh right now. major media well. top leader well. nation idolize ignorance. governments usually go stricter lockdowns several weeks infection wave starts rising relaxes several weeks cases start falling sure. Given waves usually several weeks long most, usually see lockdowns working. virus run people easy get, driving infection rate wave flatten whether lockdown not; thing able influence high wave going be.  people died car accidents vaccine passports. company 1,800 21% said wanted return office full time. No, that’s says NCL website. even read link posted? - become norm businesses set stage vaccine passports, governments eventually forced it. largely depends role. appear IC; sure, go bunker. lead hand, outside bunker. roles stretched hard replacing person meetings. studio well, though. reason ever go back. enough success video calls make anything lacking. completely agree. long people able jobs effectively home would office, there's reason to. Hell, I'm sure there's good portion employees many different sectors shown increased productivity working home. Hopefully leads shift work culture allows people keep this. nah, nobody wants that. know. San Francisco’s response frustrating me. Felt like hyper focused cracking fun way driven Puritanism evidence. Exactly, doctors warned resulting wave anxiety disorders one biggest residues entire pandemic.

People need get help, soon Far fuck away everyone.

I'm one people could stay inside house days without bother lack human contact. graph visualization I'm missing? see table aggregated data story.  games I've bathrooms either empty one person time. stadiums built hold tens thousands people couple thousand everything feels empty. Same. like it, [send judge know personally. know genuine full time carer grandmother? AZ, OP from. Well talking abour getting vaccine, dick cut off. would get vaccine means get în person classes fall. also would love collegues wont chance outbreak uni get closed again. Yes, someone cant get vaccine medical reasons wants online classes totally fine. Yeah! God complicated. Michigan passed Pennsylvania daily case average, assume that's meant. 1. said endgame? many go far.
2. said, conspiracy product cause fear. Fearful people heightened need act expedites thought process, preferring simple understand, immediate solutions. Fearful people often seek pariahs messiahs. gravitate apparent solutions easy grok dramatic. solutions include elements heighten fear... Well, feedback loop. 
Strong emotions tend strongly incline us one way another, frontal cortex comes excuses so, emotions merited, right call along. 
Put together, large section populace stoked fear anger get act quickly, strongly, effectively thoughtlessly, particular set directions. 
What directions, directions ask? endgame probably applies. directions combination intentional incidental, following intentions unknown players.

It makes sound almost like one conspiracies. straight told father ashamed embarrassed son nonsense supporting. 

He's gotten alittle better since then! 17 7 months. really want give every data possible online know. (living Arizona) vaccinated State POD site ran ADHS. create account ADHS portal order book appointment. First dose two weeks ago second dose next Thursday.

So, state information. like me, probably coming subreddit daily updates USA vaccinations.

Yesterday, mods decided create new rule [banning data shame useful pieces information sub.

If unsatisfied change, [send message politely ask remove rude. What? main reason coming wondering went last days. Thyroid cancer rates increased due increased cancer screening. true death toll Chernobyl highly disputed even worst estimate it’s still safest form power per kWh produced funnily enough. work animation, personally I’m ready go back studio. Half perks job in-person connections, free food, studio events general vibe studio, working home pretty depressing (especially since got first animation job two months pandemic started)

Having said that, hybrid would good, really gotten used extra sleep time chores such. anyone know end game looks like here? don’t get vaccines another two months, heard, percentage population kill Brazil? No? Even outside get sick one wearing mask.. based picture one wearing masks. Holy shit that’s dumb UBI. Though would mean rich people paying higher taxes. like flu. /s

In hindsight find toll Covid19 much higher immediate impacts. disaster still unfolding. forget important part: Far fuck away people pay tolerate. you

stay


home say, think people good intentions sparked lot this. It’s hard decide what’s better scenario pandemic. Make true accurate information readily available, control content messaging try ensure people take seriously. Clearly, governments entities gone latter. remember done university students China 2017 investigated use surgical masks respirators prevent spread original SARS coronavirus. Facebook blocked actual pdf report. YouTube took videos mentioned it. google used bury ten pages down. that’s found homemade masks didn’t help prevent spread. study found *did* prevent spread, I’m sure wouldn’t banned study. 

And something dangerous I’ve seen Sam Harris talk about. Banning studies outcome isn’t convenient. talked sense study previously confirmed ethnicities humans amount Neanderthal (caveman) them. Except black Africans. said ‘imagine reversed. *only* black Africans *had* Neanderthal genetic pool. Anyone discussing would called racist. science can’t racist. people study clue results were. can’t racist. we’d still call racist. I’m pretty sure since they’ve disproved found Neanderthal *all* genetic pools now. 

Regardless. lots censoring done name safety think hurt. Fauci tells us even young children die covid. never says Children 20, flu deadlier. censoring, think causes distrust “leaders” “experts” unfortunately sends many people rabbit hole conspiracy false information. Didn’t see mentioned article, point inquiry, anyone know within infected group applies equally infected co-morbidities infected not? imagine 60 year old diabetes hypertension would much higher rate healthy 25 year old feels like bad sinus infection (would interesting know based could respond policy perspective allocate resources need). equal across board two subgroups? mind, clarify direct result pathogen brain / CNS, result psychological causes? 

For instance, broke ankle damaged nerves couldn’t walk 8 months (luckily got better!) went bout depression. ankle damage didn’t cause depression, emotional angst able walk independently did. I’d intrigued know public policy could changed support facing unwanted results. Totally agree. truly point anyone get vaccine (not paper actually get appointment) wait weeks open everything up. people choose protect themselves, that's them. can't keep inflicting economic damage subset population refuses vaccinated. prediction (and admit could wrong) we'll still need 2 months now, probably longer that. 

Consider: we're coming year us avoided crowded places costs--even restaurants bars movie theatres allowed operate 2019, many us still would stayed away real risk illness and/or death. sense taking risk go away magically vaccines? think so. 

I think real trepidation going back society may well alleviated knowledge everyone particular venue vaxxed. entered conversation good faith. ignoring facts don’t support desired outcome. really point continuing conversation you. I’m responding others reading done. 

1- Priority groups defined differently state every state different point vaccination program. 28% population vaccinated evidence everyone wants one able get one. fact, would argue clear evidence opposite given Americans say want vaccinated. say everyone high risk group chance get vaccinated. incorrect.

2- Hospitalizations fatalities tell part story lagging indicator. indicating vaccinated state / area. think decisions take factors hospitalization fatalities account. incorrect.

*Also wonder area in. last time checked hospitalizations states. may area better another discussion restrictions overall town state. 

3- many studies demonstrating effects prevalence PASC / Long Covid. limited hospitalized severe patients either. anxiety symptom one many comparison covid. one saying anxiety keep us “locked down.” type statements show conversation good faith. think PASC / Long Covid rumors real. incorrect. 

4- don’t understand ulterior motives think teachers Facui wanting keep restrictions place. must understand teaching remotely hybrid situations much work usual person model learning. one’s pockets lined. fact teachers chance get vaccinated. US made March “National School Childcare Staff Covid-19 Vaccination Month,” but, due supply, mean every state able offer school staff ability shot arm. Even had, people protected day 1 shot 1. mention delay “teachers digging heels in” fail reply fact teachers yet vaccinated. Previously, acknowledged mental health issues concern. would seem keeping schools open capacity allows mitigation strategies effect (determined per school) another month two would hardship consequences increasing case numbers, PASC / Long Covid, deaths parents, burden healthcare workers. pointed times schools remain closed teachers don’t want get vaccinated. incorrect.

5- responded question mitigation strategies would like see place idea getting case numbers reduces community spread therefore waiting 1-2 months greater total positive effect outweighing temporary discomfort holding off. 



It seems difficulty seeing past experience immediate area unwilling unable look findings scientists study covid. feel bit like wasted time responding maybe someone open mind benefit reading this. 

The following links people interested learning more:
CDC Covid Data Survivors’ Reports Timing, Duration, Health Impacts Post-Acute Sequelae SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) COVID Health Inequities: Role Primary COVID-19 Look title post. Maybe get news like lol. lol post denialist subreddit, going entertain fearmongering find 30% Americans super-spreaders misinformation. Period. Like commenter u/quebec1867 said above, good employers need cater employees: ones want work home, ones want office, in-between. Quick look OPs profile showed Arizona. said son hospitalized covid AZ january 15th: first case Arizona January 26: course possible could covid, OP full shit they're saying son hospitalized confirmed covid overlooked Trump hyperbole. average person is, large, idiot. specific particular worldview though conservatives tend mistrust science liberals reason Yeah, people side effects seem younger, fewer (so far).

But, thinking it... know vaccine works, side effects... make sense?

My body ready protect me. mean Russians 🤔 

Russians plant disinfo. Americans spread it. people enforcing lockdowns even follow tje rules themselves. They're accepting full pay, constantly caught traveling parties. agree karma race post

And know what? God forbid somebody profits karma rest us get informed. Germans live lala land right believe every place earth like Israel, night clubs opening thanks lots vaccines, etc.

So think Germany's vaccine drive absolute failure. Even though we're basically lagging 2 months behind US maybe 4 months behind Israel. 23% Germans believe Germany able offer everyone first vaccine dose end September (!) absolutely crazy. Politicians could tell us ""the sky blue way"" people would think must red, since can't trust politicians since say everyone get vaccine couple months.

I know happened. Probably media blame. love report minor setbacks like ""AZ reduces Q2 delivery target 16m 14m"". Today ""Business Insider"" even made fake claim, saying Moderna delivery three weeks cancelled. left wallet there... sitting room day

And collecting paycheck it. That's literally greatest. Downvoting thumbnail alone $100 buy many tootsie rolls. Yeah much denialism there. wife fittest person would ever met happen her. 

So people like understand odds work you.

Makes want shake them! correct. hybrid model 5 years now. WFH 4 days week office week. would usually schedule team meeting day often go lunch together. socialization team building important, largely offices waste space. local mayor say exactly recently. kids vaccinated, mask up! don’t think words matter council last say, obviously we’ll hearing kind thing. [You're either ignorant wonder much transmission *during* game fans attend games go socialize bars homes course that’s people generally do. sure makes difference policy standpoint game attendance still root cause. oh puhlease. someone also lives Germany, really terrible. I'm saying great job moment, especially every state, even county thing, could lot worse. Dutch honestly I'm still happy lived Germany throughout pandemic Netherlands. Make accessible people need it. People at-risk relatives household want limit much go people underage kids, since schools several states won’t back pre-pandemic normal while. 

I’d say let people want don’t commute option well proven get stuff done home. we're global pandemic

Man people hate called biases; hopefully help informed going forward. Pfizer started withholding shipments Sunday. Leveling vaccination curve evident starting two weeks ago. That’s interesting. Thanks details.

It's amazing, coworkers quit plan quit companies reluctance stay work home, work anywhere. legitimate reason go back office role outside micromanagement, proven need, social aspects, achieved ways. longer gone one, coworkers wanted stay work home.

Anecdotally, I've seen article proven true. 

The downside basically call 24/7 rather working 40 hrs before. make less per hour, since I'm working more, salary... still prefer it. Yeah, productivity monitoring setup computer I’d imagine switch remote work would far less impact.

It’s basically pay cut. sounds fun! sounds like similar yoga experiences haha. moved neighborhood room go walks community pool I'm hopeful exercise happening summer one way another. problem is, works air outside comfortable.

If really cold out, heating costs become astronomical always replacing warm air inside.

Same deal hot and/or humid out, cooling costs go roof.

So solve one issue possible covid transmission, create energy-wasting, environmentally unfriendly mess.

Personally talking EU : Rolling Average Daily Vaccinations 3.43 Million India vs 3 Million US. you’re qualified comment matter? 

The AZ vaccine already saved many lives, people literally expecting 100% risk free vaccines, going happen, many variables.

Rightly studies done action taken based evidence, look data, even Pfizer vaccine issues don’t hear everyone saying MHRA received 283 UK reports suspected ADRs Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine patient died shortly vaccination, 421 reports Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine 9 brand vaccine unspecified. majority reports elderly people people underlying illness. Usage AstraZeneca increased rapidly such, reporting fatal events temporal association vaccination however, indicate link vaccination fatalities reported. Review individual reports patterns reporting suggest vaccine played role California, sports athletes tested Monday morning Wednesday taking field Friday night. 

Some teams miss games kids tested positive Damn bro you’re tight. side effects characteristic immune response. article suggest protein caused side effects rather thats vaccines work. Hi Dr. Frieden, really appreciate AMA. trying make sense CDC's recommendations fully vaccinated people, really understand something. [CDC guidance fully vaccinated says fully vaccinated, need quarantine come contact someone COVID positive. suggests belief CDC vaccinated people contract spread COVID. seems consistent recent CDC study found 90% reduction asymptomatic covid cases fully vaccinated.

This encouraging, however CDC still says fully vaccinated people go medium large gatherings, attend person events without mask. happy wear mask gym something, suggestion seems imply go restaurants bars can't wear mask main activity (eating / drinking). 

Can explain two recommendations simultaneously make sense?  feels like sub turned opposing discussion side 100% normalcy. discussion like Gottlieb saying, reasonable not, seen ridiculous. Curious approach vaccinating kids. Pfizer released data 12 15 years olds last week indicated submit approval next week two. Based timeline previous approvals would expect approval FDA mid May (assuming data checks out) yet still see projections won’t get group late summer/early fall.

For vaccines, trials started way infants projections approval 12 indicate early 2022 likely. seems slower adult versions. driving slower approach? higher risk vaccines children require slower approach? lower risk Covid young people play role vaccine approval approach? problem vast majority American public lost trust government. state (for part) Federal. say “in interim” people don’t trust governors anymore ever end “the interim”. US UK striked Governmental level.

U.S. public schools required proof vaccination enrollment children public schools since 1850s. even get Homeoffice beeing ugly.

That's strange!

I example Crohns Disease, sucks fuckton. pain go trought sometimes makes wonder keep living.

You idea like others simple tasks, let alone drive work etc.

And say may ugly disrespectfull chose work home. everyone real choice comes health kids draw line somewhere. way 50s recommended flu jab 49. Basically seems suggest mRNA covid vaccines may also provide protection common cold viruses (ie: HCoV-NL63). 
 
So....bonus! third wave British mutant making vast majority cases densely populated areas around Oslo. spreads especially fast kindergartens schools, situation bad European countries. hurry up. father 69 years got vaccinated Norway today getting close done 65+ group. underestimate quality internet 3rd world countries. US Canada worse many 3rd world countries regard. really nice graph. former NYC department health commissioner, think city’s response past year? think current situation city months?

Thank you. said people early 30s weigh risk request different vaccine prefer year study study shown outdoor transmission limited nonexistent. top centuries research airborne pathogens. easily enough data criticize people agencies ignoring science. worse covid (for me). 

Not sure implying covid previously here, case reported many people previously covid respond first dose severe side effects. number essential services needed keep people alive could never flattened curve zero, even would return another nation. Isn’t job provide method? aren’t constantly trying renegotiate contracts instead continuing screw people? Children (under 12) won’t able get vaccine it’s safely assessed age, probably 2022. able estimate risk vaccinated adults able infect children carrying, getting sick Covid? know it’s safe low risk children go school around friends can’t vaccinated? “normal” kids health concerns (like asthma immunocompromised). Thank you! Wow that’s lot great questions! I’ll best:

1. Thanks!
2. need make public health primary care stronger, US globally. need improve ability countries around world find, stop prevent health threats emerge. actually one core goals group, Resolve Save lives. [This outlines what’s needed [this shows page shows [get created Resolve 4 years ago goal  reducing risk pandemics. We’ve made progress – obviously enough!!
3. prevent variants need reduce uncontrolled spread wherever occurs. means fixing vaccine equity US vaccine manufacturing globally. That’s key. Also, masks distancing stopping clusters reduce spread. lower spread, lower risk even dangerous variants.
4. don’t know, it’s best hope. It’s possible vaccine-escape variants, mRNA technology likely tweaked occurs.

Thank you! already started week. low amount start due current vaccine supply. start GP offices stable supply chains lager amount vaccines arrives. Also, forget ober 35000 GP participating atm. amount increase weekly basis. grandparents girlfriend already got vaccinated. know personal conditions priority group 2-3 offered vaccine relatively shortly Same. Started new job moved new town RIGHT middle pandemic. met 1% coworkers person. :-/

That said, I'd lose mind go back full time. I'd like 1-2 days remote optional days. IT, long coverage we're good.

Good luck yours! It'll get better. :) depends. really miss office don’t miss every day. 2-3 days week choose would perfect. Risk lower prevalence lower proportionally currently uk keep trying tell people every time change workforce people ultimately benefit top.

This going yet another example pandemic benefited wealthiest society. Based well stimulus payments went three rounds doubt that. Dr Frieden, speed vaccine development distribution process even quickly react new variants targeted booster shots? parts process could improved? Ok thanks, helps put perspective. No, said Low scenario lower currently have, Medium scenario similar currently have. everyone super cool office like that, unfortunately. either one I’d rather wfh go nice gym cafe time rather put sort commute / dealing co-workers bosses person day long nice gym/cafe perk probably wouldn’t use anyway I’m already spending 9+ hours away home asshole thing say.

I read long haulers say I'm stunned much sound like me. 

I'm super interested science finds there's big enough reason actually dig people feel way covid. would expect they'll discover kind post viral syndrome confined covid. still live near school since im classes half year job half year Right, grandfather's funeral cost 15,000..and anything close extravagant. (To clear, die Covid. died years ago.) 

Amazing people site want free everything, program compassion quite frankly, apology neglect previous administration, criticized much. New cases plummeted week measures.

Measures take effect 2-3 weeks implemented. Sounds like lockdown help much here.  layperson perspective, would seem sufficient PPE protocols supplies typically lacking dealing highly infectious diseases. seen United States government right wrong put advantaged position future? That’s benefit authoritarian government. value personal freedoms United States don’t allow government weld us inside houses. 

I also live state virtually restrictions enjoyed mostly Covid free society. tears here, enjoy living United States. guess missed ""...rate severe illness"". includes long-haul, genius.  


You're ideologically possessed, irrational. base views science evidence, emotion. also factually wrong. Way go! thread: people forgetting biggest factor catching COVID, serious case is, *amount* virus exposed to. Various risk factors lower threshold people, even perfectly healthy adults children experienced serious complications (though rare). 

But masks distancing still important even slowly reopen economy. Anything minimize exposure public setting helpful, it’s nothing sort thing. Even you’ve vaccinated it’s important, since vaccines aren’t 100% effective (obviously) since also quite haven’t hit herd immunity.

I’m planning small wedding ceremony May 8th, it’s tracking almost everyone vaccinated fashion, anyone major risk factors already fully vaccinated. it’s still going mostly outside masks distancing certain pods people. aren’t place anything riskier that, even amongst mostly vaccinated, small, crowds. felt less like work play video games, smoke weed, watch TV work.

Great. bum. wonder comment triggered you. seem represent majority sub. ahead 

Then say ahead. Right. I've going back office I'm vaccinated 35 minute commute gives time read listen podcasts working home. I've realized really important time decompress boundaries work life home life really important me. Way less people would die didn’t lock down. 100-150 million people dying extreme poverty lockdown ??????? still go gym wear mask entire time. cut strength training use Arc machine get HR 150 hold 30 minutes, get out.

I sufficient evidence anything home going gym work ritual keep up.  No. They’re not. There’s 300 million people country. You’re getting accurate representation 0.0000029% population. It’s absurd claim that. evidence building ventilation systems could really use full rethink pandemic protocol. focus old air out, new air in. headline/title original one BBC time publishing (16 hours ago). made edits article, recent 14 hours ago.

A lot talked convincing conservatives Republicans get COVID vaccine, know find important well. 

What best strategy seen far convince others? 

How combat misinformation people easily refute scientific evidence quick misleading Instagram posts memes? Keep hiding basements guys.. it’s safer there. UK got hit UK variant first short, intense period high death rate exacerbated much higher population density. That's control now, Brazil getting worse worse.   WFH amazing family. husband actually started month lockdown he's home since early March 2020. hope never go back. 

I concerned long term impact cities across country. Companies renew leases high rise offices. Downtown lunch establishments suffer. 

His company still lease they've already decided summer rent much smaller place allow employees office daily. covid, 17 years, paid 480 dollars monthly train ticket, plus 40 bucks month parking, 1.75 bridge toll, gas get train station.

Then would ride train 1.5 HOURS WAY FIVE DAYS WEEK!!!. I’d wake crack dawn get home 7:00.

Everyone packed train assumed normal way living.

No fucking way again.

Luckily company adapted well working home. little talk returning office, one thing CEO told us old way working 5 days week office never happen again.

We recently employee poll, 60% staff never want go back office 2% said wanted go back 5 days week. 38% mix heavily skewed towards 1 2 days week. GOT VACCINE LEGGO Lol. Enjoy hiding basement rest life. People much commute begin with?

People enjoy human interaction throughout day?

People space accomodation work? wait excess deaths stats Brazil, plus another year virus churn various regions. fails Turing test. Hi Dr. Friedan,

How feel balance risk vs benefit people traveling internationally order get vaccinated? 

I’m American living EU, fact member risk group means I’m getting shot vaccine months least, fly back states I’d odds getting jab within couple weeks. shot offered employees mother's school. told estimate 25% took it. Allocations week 4/12. rough states high demand open 16+ appointments fully booked. J&amp;J causing huge shift. 

Total 4/5: 21.1M

Total 4/12: 4/5: 9.4M

Pfizer 4/12: 4/5: 6.8M

Moderna 4/12: 4/5: 4.9M

J&amp;J 4/12: 0.8M

I see evidence shifting allocations based vaccine demand either. state-by-state numbers look same. Frustrating point several states using 90% versus states using 60-70% still receiving amount doses. mind coming office glad people stayed away. said that, living 5 mile commute. 


Next job, I'd prefer work home often means rent buy away city. bonkers get job, pay nose live within commuting distance get job allows pay rent mortgage live within decent commute. thoughts ways nations freedom press/media improve critical fight conspiracies, rumor, bad information? would say probably percentage want go back full time. hybrid new norm. happening? Lol, about? USA approve it? realise Pfizer causes blood clots well right? gotta hand EU, misinformation propaganda techniques beyond par lol. called “half-a**ed lockdown skeptic” r/newjersey asking question whether we’ll public health measures protect kids. 

It seems like lot people state dead set there’s vaccine toddlers. MRNA vaccines exciting many benefits. 

One often touted benefit they're faster develop traditional methods. However looking progress vaccines COVID, see MRNA vaccines finished development and/or testing time frame traditional ones like AstraZeneca. 

Is first time use MRNA vaccines, future developments would even faster? reason faster develop test AstraZeneca example? Even wasnt case, side Germany countries anything relied EU commission order vaccines them, arguably even bigger incompetence It’s incentive sample 800 accurate representation public whole 800 people enough uncertainty &lt;2%. study tracking effectiveness two J&amp;J doses 8 weeks apart.

Three Mile Island never danger breaching containment eihter. I'm sure would people lazy fuck Yet another great question! think two issues behind ""no"" answers vaccinated people.

1. situations, likely many unvaccinated people, vaccinated people, gathering broadly.
2. vaccine perfect. large groups, exposure vulnerable people, even risk low, consequences could high. Good luck finding data like now.
I seen large data set takes factors account. dedicated room work help case. Anytime need something closet compelled check emails send quick. think hybrid model nice likely still office 4 days week weeks. Idk headline made laugh. I'm picturing like person like ""nah fuck that"" thought China 6M one day days ago. true. first time generation workers taught this. said mild covid, take anti inflammatories (paracetamol)? theory long covid likely happen mild cases, mild cases people usually take anti inflammatories high fewer, high fewer causes dysregulated immune system acute covid over. envy can't work home due job, deeply wish lazy, selfish mtfkers get back soon possible miserable offices. Engineering. got mast cell related definitely. Mast cells also release heparin EMA said theory ""immune response, leading condition (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, HIT) similar one seen sometimes patients treated heparin"". rare problem people mast cell activation issues think first time recorded happening heparin produced within body heparin administered drug. goes along theory inappropriate mast cell activation driving severe Covid disease also long Covid. someone 35, long Covid, recently diagnosed MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome) due 2nd AZ jab couple months, I'm bit worried. Absolutely missing swollen lymph nodes  almost egg reading headline feel fortunate work pursuing hybrid schedule. renew lease current building looking office space half size specific uses small collection desks people sign-out.

They saying 3 days home 2 office. think likely couple days month best. reason go office anymore. proven last year.  know personal life never virus least never tested positive tested antibodies. However, think isolation number memory. I'm fully isolated, still neighbors see, game friends, outside normal routine years seems causing issues.



Its anyone's guess point. probably years know much damage covid really did. daughter retail feel pain! It’s shitty retail right now. People smart couple thousand years ago. difference large body knowledge draw from, better institutions help us. every time heard say n-word title almost “34% remote workers say they’d rather kill return office listen another bullshit story John” probably gained 30 lbs. 100% man. feel I'll lucky though work situation go week. I'd take that. absolutely want go times week more. afford to? Oh wow, districts near reopened may. hybrid options wanted. must feel strange. I’m 26 know memory shouldn’t yet. It’s piss that’s aerosolized. It’s also breath. Mask covers 90 10 slip gave good space interesting discussion. criteria delete news case counts too. would illegal?  family member say won’t get one God determines time go something like that. brain free reason... Bathrooms also potential problem, though 1) long 2) unlike drinking beer, mask Lol live scared forever? Oh yeah, you’re tight cute answer needed. :) important note real world data getting result entire sum actions behaviour country/jurisdiction looked at. 

Ireland long strict lockdowns. Including bans outdoor gatherings 5km limit (from home) exercise. Currently allowed meet one person another household outdoor exercise. isn’t much actual enforcement (only 5km limit gets enforced people moved parks crowded) many people voluntarily follow law. 

You can’t extrapolate risk outdoor activities banned here. really see points constructive agree judgement.

We would've never heard 19 deaths would've kept dark EU countries flagged up. probably age restriction either. trust government NHS vaccines this? personal point infrastructure vaccine like flu shot.

Sun never sets British variant covid.... could easily fill random applications wherever Indeed log them. way paper trail get audited. Yes, accurately would say pay difference urban rural communities.

It costs lot live big city, labor commands higher wage. Rural living less expensive, smaller salary buys equivalent better quality life.

Most big companies located big cities, big city labor costs. big city laborers working home long enough smart managers realized could easily pay another equally qualified American say 20% less exact job.

In time companies looking cut expenses, think overlook major cost cutting opportunity. TBH danger 100% WFH outsourcing.... hybrid least justifies keeping local employee. totally WFH what's stop company NY high cost living hiring someone less money Wyoming thing? Hell, jobs hire someone India even less? soon say. Maybe vaccine-induced immunity last years. Maybe virus change much. maybe will. Time tell. now, get vaccinated turn! Thanks! What, Woo hoo!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There's power union! would even give 2 weeks notice quitting spot lol. work night “catch up” feel unproductive time day, you’re sucker. Agreed. guess cool house stuff, sucks don't. Gotta wait till people coming back offices first haha. Without position pointless. Pretty happy they've kept pandemic ghost town office. Yup too. mom washes everything needs used day refrigerated. Everything else 4 day quarantine basement. got vaccine appointment tomorrow! stepdad goes it. Neither construction workers. Wtf point. majority office jobs like doctor. evidence whatsoever variants escape mainstream vaccines get USA

The vaccines touted 90-95% effective. Variant still chance spread disease. 

To me, attitude thing what's letting linger. whatever, obviously convinced hope right. Man feel this. Feels like Im always work cant fully escape. rarely even think switching gaming PC more. Im desk 40+ hrs would want spend time there. 

On one hand it’s nice focus hobbies, would still like desire game occasionally. I'm stealing someone else's comment here, probably high (which sucks I'm 2 weeks first tomorrow!)

 CDC's study showing 80% single-dose efficacy tiny - 4k participants. UK Israel ran much larger studies (\~24k UK one, whopping 1.2M Israeli one) UK found 72% efficacy three weeks first dose; Israel found 66%.  one week post second dose, UK found 86% Israel found 94% efficacy. Based this, second dose improvement probably wider 80% vs 90% .  study:  study: started working remotely, even tho office walking distance house, I'm gonna try hybrid. little things like much easier run errands kid naps I'm still home, I'm office she'd take everywhere. helped. Omitting search term first results would seem sus people, fit everything. Found boomer 😂 He's clearly salty backbreaking labor make money, resents people that.

It's sad, really.  agree; however, worries employer realizing this, think also care exactly pantsless employee lives. ship job China 1/3 salary. absolutely work harder wfh position. Right like two hours day work sit rest. home work there. Probably going happy years lose job low wage worker India. already outsourced. agree US need population would assume US government looking forward vaccine diplomacy population vaccinated achieve need vaccine get.

Before pandemic ambivalent EU, everything done throughout crisis made look organisation complete disdain. latest saga like watching scorned lover shitpost facebook consequences EU's petty actions far, far damaging. ashamed themselves. People enjoy human interaction throughout day?

If rely colleagues human interactions throughout day got worse problems lot people want go back fully partially, think genuinely like co-workers. do, miss them. way miss co-workers old workplaces try stay touch them. miss small jokes casual talk coffee machine everything like that. try replicate Slack, certain extent. around good co-workers makes work fun, amazing. 

I also miss sheer efficiency office work types tasks, like pair-programming, teambuilding, solving urgent issues types meetings. Anything highly collaborative runs smoothly everyone place physically. 

I also object idea making friends point work - me, big point work. great place make friends, work would much boring friends there. work boring way?

Something like 2/3 split WFH office would amazing me. worked hybrid little 6 years. hated days went office. people wanted socialize. get work done position Russian Chinese vaccines? certainly heard example, Trump's administration trying lobby Brazil use Sputnik V. possible leave Cold War aside join forces countries vaccination? Good news terms true vaccine proven safe yet again, also EMA put side effects public information regarding vaccine. 

I’d take heartbeat, whole process makes trust vaccine, vaccines general EMA even more. mans needs take pills lmao hear fake vaccination cards. Hello Dr. Frieden, questions are: going universal vaccine development? possible particular vaccine one time shot protect variants? Also enough people vaccinate hesitation/antivaxx medications fight covid? tests going well? What's protocol mixing two different kinds vaccines? I'm really curious  got one dumbest takes I've heard know sub allowing made post. Essentially EMA said vaccinations AZ continue normal age groups. Nothing changed except blood clots listed rare side effect. That's almost chance dying COVID 40 healthy. Bist du´s, Jan ? also still get that's vaccine available major side effects. Mild injection site soreness exceptional 5G reception.  think meant 2 weeks first dose, isn’t unbelievable. laughed hard. Ware-homo lolol  Took step 1 hour ago. Thanks reassurance! agreed, bad publicity it, last thing need influencing vaccine acceptance rate US.  hope abandon reason alone. understand need privacy, need close contact extended periods time. close contact partner caused lot stress lives, trade anything. Anything...

I'm going elderly wishing spent time them. Yeah feel last sentence sure That's felt mine, got Johnson one. feeling like shit 2 days straight, high fever. husband got one single side effect, thankfully. smugly brag cause problem boss. 1 20.000 Norway quite bit higher. Good decision EMA. collective sense benefits AZ outweigh risks, doubt that. it'd interesting see countries like Norway, Germany Denmark continue vaccinating without age restrictions risk assessments based demographics vaccinate younger groups vaccines. Same, boarded remotely January year, it’s real hard meet colleagues outside immediate team. know currently seems even already long-haul seeing positive effects vaccines. So, logically, unlikely vaccinated person much risk long-haul symptoms, especially chance infection low begin with.  irony can't even count number comments wanting force companies using vaccine passport... Lololol testing enough show sure deadly. likely ton cases undetected, leading increased deaths. Ummm...companies already tried years ago cheap labor india. work well see different now? yet? Could also perhaps mistakes German government made? arguing bad faith here. might want to, people gonna lmao 20% country's population. 50% cases. yeah, worse per capita. Regarding positive rate, also higher states. 

Fun fact: largest state country actually lowest test positivity California reporting lowest COVID-19 positivity rate U.S. Sees username

Something tells know nothing China. China home thousands years innovation engineering, cardiology, art, well origin Tang Dynasty, boasted one impressive empires economies Asian history. also sight one first Liberal republics Asia (the Republic China existed 1911 1949.) Chinese people also enjoy fascinating impressive culture.

The thing sucks China government which, vile, genocidal, authoritarian, irrationally demonized extent, people claiming wants conquer world, doesn't. please, stop Sinophobe get better opinion. Haha. Can’t wait free market “advocates” wrap heads around one fake vaccine card easier fool covid test. hope, that’s ”returning normal” People 30 first dose Oxford / AstraZeneca side effect clotting still advised get second dose.

That's great news rollout, shows confident rarity issues. superiority complex. hell come conclusion? mean drugs take years show negative affects, seriously doubt vaccine one tho I’m taking Yeah I’m glued coronavirus vaccine news day long I’m honest, yet literally first time I’ve heard that.

Even questions answer fill signing vaccine (and immediately getting vaccine) *nothing* mentioning take Tylenol, ibuprofen, etc. might blunt immune systems response. 

I even spoke nurse cannabis possibly using help side effects *specifically* worried alleviating symptoms meant curbing immune systems response vaccine, nurse spoke pharmacists decided would perfectly okay. Nothing Tylenol stuff mentioned.

If true might serious fuck it’s mentioned all, especially long list things ask getting vaccine. want sick people wearing masks go out. really want normalized, getting sick winter dope hell.

Its far politicized think significant amount people would man could dream.  Guess Ranger baseball fans Texas ones following science! Masks little harm economy increasingly effective decreasing spread COVID. keep masks reopen faster rather vice versa. Yes cases seem clustered amongst younger people, perhaps especially young women. indication people auto immune deficiencies proven yet. Given very, low risk Covid young, otherwise healthy people, even slim chance vaccine causing blood clot obviously affect ethics/advisability giving AZ jab young people. Hence EMA UK vaccine regulator recommended young people given AZ real live small ass apartment tiny ass room barely office space 5 people always distracting easy procrastinating  Well Serbia catastrophic results 16 years suffering Merkel's ""Germany last"" ideology [From 236 379 patients diagnosed COVID-19, estimated incidence neurological psychiatric diagnosis following 6 months 33·62% (95% CI 33·17–34·07), 12·84% (12·36–13·33) receiving first diagnosis.

OK, two thirds people affected already affected prior getting COVID-19. I'm unsurprised COVID-19 failed cure anxiety cohort. diagnostic categories common patients COVID-19 influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 1·44, 95% CI 1·40–1·47, diagnosis; 1·78, 1·68–1·89, first diagnosis) respiratory tract infections (1·16, 1·14–1·17, diagnosis; 1·32, 1·27–1·36, first diagnosis)

I think writing headline, would gone ""COVID-19 survivors 16% likely neurological mental disorders people respiratory tract infection"". course, write headlines living, one's going click that. Yes, vaccinate people vaccine doses, yet. cost benefit ratio getting vaccine charts blows mind. Go get free vaccine mild side effects virtually chance severe reaction vs virus things plus more. One best trade offs ever make. constantly announcing things unable actually do. average number daily vaccinations pretty much stagnating 300,000 last month, number doses delivered period time well 10M; yet show sufficiently significant increase make think July realistic. I'd get second dose Biontech. One issues may making AZ less effective vector immunity, second dose different vaccine would avoid problem. Dr Straus EMA gave 1 100,000 figure, believe bases data provided Germany. bro let's goo  crushing figure that, end, honestly close. relationship borne convenience proximity, much like relationships neighbors classmates. quit first ""real"" job, everyone shrugs wishes well. likely buy beer, hear again. 

I've stuck neck people work, thinking would me, found quite quickly harshly wouldn't. know people life would help fix flat tire 2:00 am, help move, listen cry breakup. people spending time much possible. Definitely Frank accounting get spreadsheets done needs work weekend get printed. prove vaccination? doesn’t seem tracking system I’ve seen. let’s replace Chikfila sauce packets opinion, US done differently outset pandemic given poorly handled?  problem **you** want go back drag others you. interactions yet ""rely"" them...  go 1 hour ago.

So 0.000072% Yeah, I’m sure cutoff longer works offer choice. would definitely harder justify 5% community! doubt half community opt next year, I’m guessing maybe quarter third still will. could wrong - surprised people didn’t switch person choice recently return final quarter. big debate right whether allow opt back person first second. kids may getting vaccinated want return. board saying need give chance return others saying need plan year offer teachers contracts clearly state whether virtual person. I’m glad they’re providing option families aren’t ready return I’m also glad aren’t going ask teachers divide attention person virtual groups - done year it’s really ideal. oop, right. sure BBC part place bottom image. I'll delete comment now. got first shot yesterday I'm feeling usual far. arm hurt little morning able workout one hour cardio (cycling) without feeling tired usual. 

I'm afraid hope figure causes blood clots. I'm 25 got vaccine country nobody wants use AZ (understandable), become available everyone wants it. Hybrid way go! roughly 50/50 split would best worlds. Great. great.  Yeah, antivaxxers shut get soon realize need annual trip Cancun Hawaii literally lived rural America 10 years 2019. Please project elsewhere. There's difference--both essentially useless ways ascertain Covid-negativity vaccination. excellent argument vaccine passports. many tested Pfizer Moderna? Likely call-sign local TV station U.S., east Mississippi River. Call-signs region start “W”; west river, start “K”.

Looking it, that’s exactly is-- CBS affiliate based Fort Meyers, Florida. Quality. Outsource work India get pay for. hell ""Coors Pure""? Coors products... impure? Congrats! 100% not. make friends work hang outside work later... think mean *children* (according CDC), isn’t necessarily “the vast majority young people.” might possible, wasn’t done. I’ve yet speak single person outside reddit thinks vaccine passports good idea. Same. lost 20 pounds diet alone feel fantastic. I've never chunky thighs before. combination longer eating out, drinking, always wanting get grocery store fast possible due no-mask morons. plan maintain lifestyle going forward, way want go back before. We've vaccinated enough people vaccinate Canada nearly 4 times. 

Stop hating country. poor substitute absent personality.  missed this. reason it? extrapolation, right? Make 100% also depends easy jump jobs time. remember post-2008 years one would even look area unless already foot door experience connections. things like employers basically hold leverage everyone desperate keep whatever job even have, that's often get away treating employees terribly. think Germany would leader EU existed. blame Macron pushing fot Sanofi ultimately produce vaccine. really part larger trend moving gig work. Loyalty company top mind long time now, unless *really* deserve it, figure huge leap think ""well could make even money probably work less boss all.""  But...I actually like co-workers also personal level, go drinking eating them? Right? Fuck self-driving trucks. I've got real world experience -and- I've got Truck Simulator hours. Sign fuck uuuuuuup, lmao. Doubt coming. Vaccine passports controversial. Businesses find easier mandate masks enough vaccinations cases drop make unnecessary. Yes, see sounding little oxy-moronish face value. Let elaborate...

At home, face constant stream interruptions. Kids. Dogs. Wife. UPS guy. Running personal errands ""lunch"". kinda shit really adds up, cumulatively day. total, time wasted working home greatly exceeds time wasted office short, occasional breaks.

Furthermore, office better access resources help even productive. marketing team right around corner - 2 hour ""lunch breaks"" return email chance. high quality printer need use marketing materials. conference rooms safely privately meet clients rather sitting fucking park (yes, actually literally indoor seating allowed anywhere state). know *exactly* mean.

I worked telecom 4 years and, man, guy would never get anything done work day. He’d float cubicle cubicle, talking everybody’s faces half hour hour... put shit ton overtime daily tasks home didn’t want take care kids that. 

Then he’d receive big bonuses received bigger percentage *hours worked* instead actually got done. bonuses would teeny-tiny compared even though I’d work regular hours “overtime”. could done home. let’s get expensive housing market is...  think big difference brazilian one chinese one. think difference stems testing set-up. think missing point, Wendy's skilled labor. there's skilled labor job requires one office, theory there's fewer qualified candidates willing take job commuting every day. thanks! also stuffy nose doesn’t seem anywhere official side effects i’m sure... probably coincidental lol. Agreed. 5 minute commute awesome downtown office, dude shared cube work-dad good friend. Staying task home, endless toys computers play with, well stocked fridge, extremely difficult unhealthy. addition social aspect, need feeling potentially watched truly productive. past year hell me. Leadership asked ideal would preparation returning site eager tell wanted keep fixed desk 3-4 days week office. Fast food pays well stick around long enough metric system? Me. actually like coworkers, enjoy interacting face face, culture organization great, job orders magnitude harder remotely. also like apartment 10x better 24/7/365. 

Is really *that* unfathomable people? could actually like job people alongside?  Thank President Biden great team. Listen. I'm going subsidize lifestyle. Get fucking job stop suckling taxpayer teat. 

Fucking bums... “Children” aren’t necessarily “otherwise healthy young people,” fyi. Gee people don’t like living like rats? Imagine that.  rest also want can't afford really hate job hunting. clicking through, looks promising, unfortunate release clearly focused investors though. Cost business, guess. I'm suspicious people trying turn buck miracles. 
 
Thanks linking. Oooof I’ve encouraged go local vaccination centre always vaccines available end day (majority AZ someone know works there) think I’m gonna wait don’t health issues. said earlier threads. Constant moving goalposts. Brits simply cant accept reality. First bullshit, eu/corporate conspiracy, problem continentals since uk cases, take vaccine regardless ""well good conditions, innit"" “entire medical world” unanimous effectiveness lockdowns. Plenty medical experts say useless. none employed governments. Groupthink real phenomenon. George Orwell wrote books it. LA. one bothers wearing one see others wearing outdoors either. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Yes, issues that. actually requires effort find places spend time going etc. much time efficient get work? mention added bonus actually fun work, ... makes work fun rather chore. win me. used drive kid school continue way office, ready full day lunch, I'd often end getting something gross office's cafeteria enough leftovers 2 lunch come back evening remnants breakfast dinner make right away, already 6 got home commuting picking kid school. 

Now drive kid school, come back home, wash dishes breakfast make breakfast good tea start day way better mood often take shower lunch break. Rough patches? CA epicentre pandemic winter get that. hybrid model would alleviate bit. went 2 days worked home 3? would nice balance you’d get person time too. auntie 68, got vaccinated start March full immunity.
The rise cases (and people ICU) dumb decisions government (like opening schools shopping malls) What's news here? sounds like business usual. Best thing yourself, regardless not. knows, maybe it'll catch least encourage others. know fully intend always wear mask feeling weather now. Ive saved least $500 month commuting. basically got raise. hope ready 2 days feeling like shit

You phrased like inevitable not. know one person mild cold-like symptoms two days. others side-effects. Hope feel better soon. would even useful see data broken healthy predisposing risk Covid. assume example ICU 30s covid risk factor like diabetes obesity. healthy 35 year old, data may reassuring. feel CDC's recent recommendation 3ft distancing schools months end school year, schools proving major outbreak centers? Right you. Many us experienced losses forgotten... losses directly impacted covid regardless whether covid cause death. isn’t ok. I’m sorry going this. me, extremely difficult. going keep speaking loved ones’ deaths need counted among pandemic losses. I’ve gotten Covid hopefully won’t, several family members friends mine none symptoms, okay. I’m young, completely healthy person get vaccine soon (I wasn’t unhealthy enough qualify now), anyways, I’m worried. 80 poor health, that’d different. think implying people countries capable Americans, dead wrong. Saying quality service comes several particular countries (English speaking) dangerous assumption. threaten white collar jobs WFH culture, commenter said, benefit “getting work PJ’s commute”. type thinking childish. already know business look maximize profit. means laying American workers hire cheaper labor, especially job convenient WFH job, stopping employers hiring outside US “talent difference” doesn’t exist? 

Also, stopping American WFH employee leaving country living somewhere else standard living cheaper? would negative effects US economy. yet. I'm living right now. positions required speak front people glad handing day. I'm incredibly social important I'm Mayor Nothing reason. 

I've working remotely 10 months I'm struggling. know anyone except see chat zoom. can't I'm stuck corner. I'm 1/2 way vaccine. I'm really seriously debating either switching remote positions going back brick mortar. even tried train classes zoom bad. Maybe it'll take another year adjustments. mean....if gets worse could blood clot year pretty much.

&amp;#x200B;

March - August = Work home

August - October = Working office

November January = Working home.

&amp;#x200B;

for past 1 month so, working full-time back office, (training) working home Monday. idea 1-2 days office week. me, establishing personal connections coworkers priority. I'm work move day...so remote work AMAZING. office, see coworkers waste much time mundane BS. They'll gossip, chitchat shopping, ramble children's weird habits - meaningless stuff. time, prefer write work numerous projects going life. brain felt completely revived working home 2 months. I'm back office, I'm constantly drained, distracted, feel brain-fry setting listening nonsense day. We've done 6 million second doses. Granted lot Pfizer, quite lot AZ too. seem occur elderly though, received vast majority shots. risk entirely younger age groups, received shots, quite different calculation. would shame, opinion, vaccinating million earlier worth small risk. hand, maximum delay get using AZ two weeks. know long haulers personally. scary know many people got covid luckily, half long term symptoms. Many never regained sense smell/taste, lingering shortness breath, one severe stabbing arm/shoulder pain began blue covid infection gone away since (4 months later). Doctors even know tell people either, scary. grateful vaccine. Thank much answers! Really appreciated helpful! Like 20 million people got it, less 50 blood clots (which also happened Pfizer vaccine). verdict? Political squabbles playing people's lives. Also benefits ICU admission, benefits long covid, hospital admission etc. skew even AZ side, explains AZ still offered another available might well use abundance caution. absolute minimum change messaging take seriously. Rhetoric effects behavior. People say lot things.......let's see do. Yes we've affected AZ supply issues unfortunately. may messed supply chains also fair them, think production process vaccine differs yields compared others. Hopefully we'll get ramped supply everyone gets offered jab asap. None us completely safe get top globally. country (US) isn’t keeping records though. article discussion government mandated vaccine passports.

But also weird stance supporting corporations collecting medical information. big factor I’ve noticed digital whiteboards people aren’t paying attention. 

They working stuff really contributing. can’t see get away it. I've never seen someone argue nuance Indeed know misinformation anti-mask, anti-vaxx type people, common misconceptions see people take pandemic seriously? interesting. I've never worked bar, would imagine make more/better money staying open later. true? deductible taxes. $270/mo 2021. Keep receipts case Can't stop wondering effective would Influenza mRNA vaccine (or dengue, really hard targer different dengue strains normal vaccines) Thanks asking! think still relevant posted [new relaunching yesterday! need structure Covid Support Services, make program true name. know quit, really miss office all. Let guess: work NYC? Germany countries started negotiations, turned EU fucked everything up. Masks protect rest, right? Companies SAVE money office space can't lord constant employees might happy. So? people then? people’s health isn’t responsibility. Stay home scared, rest us continue live normally. I've saying boss every time get chance. second company says people back office, we're going see mass exodus. People grown see wfh perk shopped for, like benefits. 

He keeps trying counter ""what going see class system develop people come office seen committed get recognized promoted often it.""

I scratch head agree that's likely eventuality, simply another reason I'd want leave job. would mean boss detached work I'm can't even see impact I'm find something else. 

All can't see reason *anywhere* needs go back office full time. benefits partial wfh solution far outweigh negatives. might depending situation before.

I pay roughly $300/month utilities, alone, vs going office.

My company stopped pay utilities. Thanks taking time answer question. time follow up, here’s little me:

I’m 48 medical issues, good shape reasonable BMI. also managed avoid infection two members household got Covid January isolate apartment me. Given that, I’d characterize personal risk illness low. 

I live Spain, claiming vaccination going track summer, exceededingly skeptical based things managed thus far. Meanwhile, ordinary friends family back US getting shots. 

I wouldn’t considering except aged, ailing parent back home currently sole responsibility sibling hands full really could use support. 

Thanks taking time share expertise. telling people hate WFH. associate WFH total lockdown never leave house except store see anyone outside household. Emoji allowed titles. Make new submission plain text title.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Tech exec here. early days pandemic, SXSW even cancelled, e-mail went group polling plans were. We're one ""tech mafias"" who's members find running investing companies industry. detailed firm gone 100% remote decade ago (Austin traffic ridiculous) how. Others group shared experience methods well. weeks later, firms tied group first big names announce 100% work-from-home notice, well Facebook, Google, etc., one first announce change permanent chose it.

With current tech, many (if most) ""office jobs"" easily done remotely. many exceptions course but, part, offices, travel from, office culture source risk inefficiency. ask blanket policies implemented, people retain freedom flexibility. 

I understand socialites *require* F2F interaction. get it, do. folks option office much want, conversely asocial also flexibility choice. Exactly Thought non-profit vaccine anyway. Surely selling everyone cost instead selling loss/lower price customers (India) subsidising charging others higher price. would like jobs another 20? another 5? lol. choose. thankk youuuuu come unemployment check might ready then. ridiculous untrue. CDC 100% say go back normal. Excellent response! I’ve studied trend time (as data scientist hobby, epidemiologist) home county, see massive undercounting beginning (your 10x multiples) beginning fall, it’s much better testing ubiquitous lines testing sites shorter, etc. Around 2-2.5x depending location, even “confirmed cases” don’t even include tests return positive antigen/rapid tests alone Yikes! vaccine causes people die! Don‘t get it! medical billing one jobs see scrolling ""improve life new job categories"" infomercials see mid-day television lol? 0* days heard anything this, links? Especially Ranger fans I’m pulled meetings I’m saying. I’m head-down type role office. really see almost zero benefit going back office, personally. 2 million Californians signed recall petition.
Newsom can’t recalled wants run President smart, also ignorant. One would hoped large body knowledge, better institutions, ubiquitous access would led less ignorance, higher ratio smarter people. pandemic exposed case. Misinformation denial rampant, magical/superstitious/religious beliefs prevalent. Texas Rangers stadium indoors roof opens. causeways enclosed. There’s way get seat outdoors. vaccine caused 19 deaths, linked 19 deaths. wonder statistical illiteracy general population 19 deaths (linked, caused by, vaccine) 30 million causes panic 1000 deaths 30 million (caused virus) day not. find far concerning. bypass hiring contract company. deal taxes regulations, etc. contract people remote areas cheap. trialing work home old company prior changing careers entirely, absolutely hated it. started associating computer desk work instead hobbies, wound spending less time things enjoyed it.

Some people need break work space relaxation space. Personally idea sacrificing part home environment help subsidize employer's operating costs appealing me, regardless people explained me. Watching TV, surprising. stadiums really packing groups hardly buffer, 30-75% people showed TV wearing masks yelling/cheering. 
 
At first seemed like intentionally trying show shots people masks on, seemed give halfway season became obvious shitty people being. also add anything. said intention much criticize inclusion emphasize direct reduction employee's compensation. Adding ""basically"" makes sound like roundabout secondary reduction mind. perspective cut dry situation.  also think years we'll better data determine whether employees chose continue working home likely terminated downsizing likely passed promotions. 

Losing opportunities socialize and/or kiss ass people make calls may prove big deal road. issue regrouping Zoom, scenario describe. Everyone gives update, put together action items, take 30 minutes never start car put pants. Lol ok buddy whatever say. Better hide deep basement, world scary place full risk. meant anxiously risk averse yourself. 

The vast majority people recover covid week 2 complications. undeniable fact.

The flu kills far children 16 covid. Also undeniable fact. Clearly mobility data telling without broader context. 

Fx compared countries Sweden’s mobility went less slowly, stayed longer. Likely result Swedens measures less consistent less efficient.

And shopping malls, schools, gyms, hairdressers, bars restaurants, etc closed extended periods Nordic countries, Sweden everything remained open throughout pandemic. Though recommendations restrictions added slowly. 

I’ve lived Denmark Sweden past year, difference two usually rather similar countries enormous, despite mobility data might tell glance. Thanks work!

Just perspective person lives (part-time) Atlanta: recently went outdoor bar mostly-maskless social event running club, met guy works CDC, specifically recommends even fully vaccinated people go large maskless social gatherings. (We chatted time, we'd received 1 Pfizer dose far). me, feel CDC's guidelines bit touch even employees following them. China also started 1 month earlier eh. mind going one two days there, given choose person remote, im working remote. me, biggest perk remote work travel work. get see much world poor kid, idea able pack laptop take trip across US without quit job take sabbatical/burn time off, really enticing. pulled meetings required for, problem need address manager. That's institutional problem, issue face face meetings office. _are_ needed meeting though, present everyone room gets 10x stuff done half time. Google mobility data? extremely large uncertainties. reliable all. 


But I'll play along, [Here's comparison UK vs Sweden mobility scientist totally embrace ability work if/when can! works wonders mental state. Longish commutes soul crushing Fair enough, long agree headline poor think largely agree. Seems like disagree degree alarm studies warrant. 90% people read headlines assuming otherwise healthy people getting covid developing severe neurological psychiatric conditions. really isn’t case. It’s evident vast vast majority people overestimate severity covid, kind headlines encourage That's insane amount money spend commuting. No, EU supply come India (though apparently made request 10 million vaccines produced there). 

Out interest many doses Poland receive AZ week? know Danes expecting 43k translates roughly 220k Poland (but Denmark might receive slightly lower % AZ get Pfizer) Yeah, seriously. know it, GOP campaigning preventing second world war via aggression red coats. great news! Maybe we’re far away universal Coronavirus vaccine. Thank you, I'm happy answer questions.

The anthrax vaccines needed stockpile. time CDC, able prove lower dose worked drive costs down. Intensive lobbying company made difficult. reason, particularly unfortunate company allies got stockpile moved CDC HHS, much susceptible political influence.

We identified two major needs stockpile: ventilators, reusable N95 masks. ventilator story one frustrating nearly 8 years CDC director, well summarized [this news N95 issue complex. learned H1N1 N95s stockpile time problematic. Many degraded storage useless. Many right model fit staff. models suggested several billion would needed pandemic, would need replaced every years. felt best solution optimize stock 10-20 million elastomeric half-facepiece respirators (and/or PAPRs). need optimized easily cleanable, improve communication patients, exhalation valves. plan left CDC January 2017. fair, WFH also pay cut:

They pay office, do. pay office utilities, do. pay internet, do. pay replace broken chair, do. Etc.

The truth companies pushing way cost pandemic employees going taken returning work.

The hard truth remote employees get paid cover company expenses employees taking on, way around. Mainland China	10	145,920,000	
China done shot get 145M, eh? Tell kids dying blood clots runaway inflammation. Even marathon runners 20’s 30’s. “vanilla” Covid... variants entered ring don’t enough studies discussing yet people ICU 70 crowd ticking downward. Plus fun exposed season’s viruses, new old alike, strangers leaning blowing fresh sausage egg cheese farts face. Commuting really atrocious. Honestly half German half Polish person always cracks dramatic people Germany issues country. pandemic general. would love continue working home subject coworker smoking since 10 decided headphones get way answering phone play youtube videos speaker instead. Preferences possibilities, alas, two different things. Here’s hoping changes. may aware, you’re infected virus infect people. think 2% people live tiny apartments city working past year maybe spouse/kids.

Or people unhappy significant other. pandemic there's actually option go people public gatherings, feeling drop quite bit.

I miss board game nights friends. don’t usually make handle heavy stuff, sometimes expected move pallets weigh hundreds pounds. also thinking people realize, least line starts running. it’s matter making sure books come okay. 

Nit great brain fog, impossible either. 

So thank you, help! I’ll call fever. Yes grocery store workers etc indeed essential, kept working lockdowns, lockdowns successful (e.g. UK Portugal recently).

Every country different issues comes enforcing borders - essential rightly say. UK island nation similar size SK, yet somehow response disastrous whereas successful. not. company find someone replace WFH schedule someone else job, remotely, third price Berlin they're well 60+ group vaccinating front line occupation groups (teacher, police etc) weeks. sure old advanced programme location fair good chance getting jab July. It’s make happen. always make point forming happy hour groups wherever work. get meet people hours kick back beers get know other. I’ve made quite friends way, even full-on social groups. people open making new friends, shy reserved make first move. company wants me.to go back office. lined work home opportunities. going leave dogs alone 8 hours. Oh god knew people opposite commute that. know hell it. excuse lack hospital capacities year better prepare.  broadly, understanding really connected. happens anywhere matters everywhere. injustice anywhere threat justice everywhere, ill-health anywhere threat health everywhere.

Thank note particular. truly global community! Thank work hope reach goals advocating for. Haha. Typical Texan. think world revolves around you. care think Texas, sure shit want live there. United States Rona. government grossly incompetent dealing pandemic.

That's absolute bullshit know it. name least 20 countries done way worse. say don’t like that, do. I'm mid 30s extreme introvert, however, I've always loved office environment interactions. 

Working home tough, man, saving 2 hours per day commuting? eating lunch alternating coworker drags 5 days week? Saves ton stress, weight, money!

I've dropped 40 lbs since WFH started. Left office around 220 lbs, around 175.

That's eating lunch every day avoiding cookies, cakes snacks throughout day.

All say still would like hybrid role, get vaccines. 2-4 months behind? Germany's vaccination timeline end similar UK. It’s little unclear title, article fill-and-finish Pfizer/BNT vaccine produced German BNT Marburg plant. Delpharm subcontractor putting vaccines vials.

Which isn’t say isn’t good news; shortage fill-and-finish much bottleneck getting actual people vaccinated lack production is. make said less true? still top5 considering lowest cases deaths? Logging workstation responding messages/emails easy.

But seeing workstation kicks brain thinking work, I'll start think issue started working resolved yet. much list grew today. working office reminders. 

That's feeling always work means me. I'm actually work, I'm reminded harder truly disconnect mentally. Brits nationalists, especially Reddit.

You saying doesnt mean anything. Go check bad uk see people swarming AZ threads. layabouts apply unemployment

doubt seeing skilled employees find competitive employers adapting market WfH. unlike fantasy land, people enjoy wasting life nothing, want work least somewhat. Thank you! Def source anxiety side effects!  Im 18-30 age range got first dose AZ two weeks ago. trouble it, mild fever soreness vaccine injected. try rational possible believe risk AZ far smaller risk catching covid. People say younger people got virus recovered quickly opinion there's it. might recover covid easily, there's high chance covid cause health issues later on. organism catching covid. 

Personally would like get second dose AZ I'm afraid country stop age group getting AZ. happens feel safe getting vaccine different company second dose. still familiar efficacy risks mixing different brands. also like left one dose. allowed choose despite risks every vaccine has. lot people work independently issues.

Yeah, working independently. point people need come together discuss done done, roadblocks overcome current project goals, etc. point meetings inevitable organize.

Those organizational days perfect fit going back office week regrouping. really matter _what_ do, things done teams regardless projects. Thank this! I'm worried side effects! Another thing, rarely get fired comments like online somehow managed economy added 900,000 jobs last month.

It's likely add similar number month.

There jobs apply for. Getting another story, getting contacts probably easier times due sheer volume new jobs.  Yeah, like wanna open time vaccines aren’t super available fine distancing guess. you’re gonna require vaccination? let people whatever want.  went WFH full time start pandemic feeling better 10+ years, WFH 3 days week (This agreement I'd permanently), turned every single time ask WFH. I'm getting half much work done, I'm reddit 4 hours day mind goes numb, hate waking morning commuting, diet sucks again, I'm tired exercise get home. reasoning? ""We need case questions come up"" bullshiiiiiiiiiiiiit. know even care I'm getting way less done, stupid fucking boomer mindset ""You allowed enjoy job"".

So I'm process using time office start business, leaving soon never looking back. shit makes mad, hope people feel find something else well. impossible mean right we're still quarantine trying avoid spreading virus. calms maybe, always bit weird unnerving posting call people interested x hobby versus going workplace people able find common ground people see every day (or every day) I’ve seeing people complaining/asking several different forums already, odd we’ve heard news. Trader Joe’s, try organic brand - tastes lot like McDonald’s  Presumably actual effectiveness would higher, hospital staff tend widely exposed general population, although studies must also complicated existence immunity prior exposure now. Thanks additional info! British (redcoat) variant sweep across America. stopping us (ok, except combination vaccines &amp; herd immunity). Although lucky, perhaps name would help encourage self-proclaimed patriots get vaccine, in, Get vaccine help stop British (variant). long bottleneck vaccine supply actual personnel/vaccination centre capacity reason work night. reason 24/7 approach happening Saarland received lot extra vaccine doses one mutations going rampant there. Well, office job since I've started career. LOL.  Hopefully willing come in-person valued employers. I'd literally rather work 6 days week spend single day 5 working fucking couch also wonder countries take mixed vaccines proof vaccinated covid. can't imagine will, honestly. parking $15 day, add gas, car maintenance everything adds quickly.

Just parking around $330 month(15*22 business days) , gas around $45 week.

That's $500 saved per month, top, get sleep eat better morning work done, save another 1h30.in traffic helps mental well-being.

Also, winter, add another 20min removing snow driveway car morning sometimes hard day work.

If wanted take bus, monthly pass subway public bus $319+tx month would still need take car park station pay certain amount per month reserved parking slot station (and still remove snow car).

All all, would wake 530am, car 6am, 90 minutes frustrating commute, work 730am 745am, start working 8am. half hour eat, shower, brush teeth, dress up. winter, even earlier clear snow (5am).

And work, would home around 630pm 7pm. Forget gym social stuff groceries, going late.

Now, wake 7am, eat good breakfast, make tea/coffee sit work whenever want. would never go back, even commute free/paid for. workplace? Doctors office? Grocery stores? people home? Bullshit stroke still result brain damage even live crowd Mask Mandys yell people Finding older coworkers want come office. 

Why always boomers life outside work want office? think know jobs b.s. seen office covering fact jobs require couple hours actual work per week.  Yes, seemingly reasonably — consider 10% around *vulnerable* person, immunocompromised, chronic illness elderly careful around vaccinated person aren’t vaccinated... minimum aware risk, rather think it’s 100% safe Plus benefit arsehole isn’t going take food office kitchen. Well looks like still us. Pouring 80% life meaningless tasks make living soul sucking enough. couch simply crosses line me. never take job requires amount work home experience past year Exactly. I'm fortunate industry personal life situation lot choice work work for. employer wants office 1 day week maybe 2, I'll consider it. tell go back M-F 8-5 again, start looking replacement. Full time, downtown office effectively pay cut point factor parking, meals, dry cleaning, etc. 

I would prefer remote full-time, also recognize career advancement sometimes requires social time colleagues superiors - like lunch, coffee breaks, happy hours, etc. That's I'm open something like 1 2 days week ask. definitely work better office. see people work better home. think depends work is. bunch tedious stuff would probably work much harder/longer could TV background get snack whenever I’m hungry. need focus concentrate can’t home. many distractions. That’s it’s pandemic kids HOME remote school. 

When kids school workers house get couple loads laundry done day would probably change minds. kids school age. word positive way company. Don’t pay keep lights heat 5 days week. Don’t need pay keep bathrooms cleaned stocked often. Less overhead pay ends benefiting long run. says people older 30, includes seniors study. know affects people seniors Pfizer Biontech vaccine reputation problem France tho. Nope side affects effects first dose minor injection site soreness. /R/antiwork pays well enough.  yes. imagine somewhere min wage close it. actually banned state! state admitted data back surprise dropped ban. never really mask mandate. state law explicitly allow enforcement punishment violators. mandate name only.

Nothing changed all. people wearing still are, people never still aren't. Chile relax travel restriction Jan people went party travel around country. obviously social distancing wont matter world Also, start looking cases probably going likely find them. 60% adults received least one dose, *lot* data shift through. [A large number people won’t side nobody bully home. Tech field, software QA good beginner point. young person, type worker drives us crazy. Old timers given expect people work since know can't get fired.  think social interactions important part work place. switched jobs pandemic feel like barely know anyone new job. kind lonely. Making keeping friends adult lot harder younger taking workplace interactions severely limits opportunity meet new people   people work office complain fair people work home demand pay increase. End result everyone work office lol Yeah doubt NYC, I'm going mid-september even I'm sure things knowing Cuomo want ease restrictions smart. experience still good fun socialising flirting, expect anything more. don’t really know man, CDC history telling people things everyone does. whole job bastion health safety, means cautious possible every single instance, plans one day say public “you act completely normally now, Covid concern” would pushing vaccines route normalcy much now. Yep. people unironically say things like 'Embrace grind'. Fuck people. I've made plenty grinds life feel like embracing shit anymore.

I've sporting events capacity restrictions. low capacity never anyone anywhere near places. stadiums built handle tens thousands. Putting 25% leaves tons room distance everywhere seats. ""technically"". Also, sure, stricter lockdown might able reopen sooner. disputing UK might able exactly this. Also, UK far faster vaccine rollout also benefical. However, point argument though. fact, UK stricter rules Germany part, could experience first hand Masters student London. German lockdown strict. Schools open, shop make appointment, go day trips even travel abroad feel that's necessary. That's much math thread... People chronic illnesses pain almost certainly shorter lifespans average people without them. kind undercutting point. even want go quarter, that. .... Except wfh purists insisting everyone stay home... option given

The people work dying get back office people we're trying avoid, constantly come waste time talking inane shit bored require captive audience talk suspect getting downvoted qualify statement ""in opinion."" economic impact businesses longer funded people commenting house? comes full circle eventually people loose jobs remote working. That’s true, definitely think benefits companies multiple offices. Especially offices multiple cities. wife’s company sold 2/3 office locations DFW using 1 remaining office employees need interact person. rest likely move 90-95% WFH. hell work meeting *days*?  think got message.  children live rurally

Sounds like life solitude I'm kind confused part comment addressing data referring to? bit people saying remote work improved relationships coworkers? **The headlin article lying omission.**

The number idientified outdoor cases set relation number total cases number trackable cases!

E. g. able track 1000 cases outdoor activities would responsible 26.2 % tracked cases. 

Furthermore set relation time spend outdoors: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), average **American spends 93% life indoors.** 87% life indoors, another 6% life automobiles. **That’s 7% entire life outdoors.**

This study made 2001! 

For example: people spend 1 % time outdoors year outdoor activities make 10 % TRACEABLE CASES would mean outdoor activities spread virus. No. would mean heavily spread virus!

So conclusion people thread wrong! glad people decide policy. spend least 10 dollars day gas including wear tear car average 31 mpg. infrastructure rural commuters means lots money spent gas, etc. get work including hour commute times way. Best part is, job completely remote, management let us. break rules surprisingly okay hahaha think good rules people able **The headline article lying omission.**

So conclusion people thread wrong! glad people decide policy. pretty easy see trends working design industry tight deadlines relatively thin profit margins. company crunches numbers individual employees project teams every month. call Royale 20I/501Y.V1? non metro areas... I'm central NC, live 40 min away office. Used fill car 2-3 times week, thats $25 per tank = $200-$300 gas alone, plus take toll road avoid traffic save 20 minutes rush hour, that's 5 bucks day, extra $150 top that. Fuck commuting.  real way developing connection fucking Teams

Of course is, otherwise one would ever able make friendship connection online medium. Teams different AOL, ICQ, old Yahoo chat &amp; groups clubs whatever were, MMO guilds, etc etc.

You open ask questions people, like relationship situation. Yeah alternative AZ I'd take it, since better alternatives I'm young healthy person, I'd rather wait. feel opposite.

Zoom meetings reduces amount small talk. logon, say needs said log off. 

I spent waaaay much time ""meetings"" manager talking football kids.. Yes agree companies definitely take advantage extra availability malicious way. whole argument rooted feel lot companies maliciously take advantage people WFH gives people option much flexibility freedom work situation. experience different everyone, go back normal people probably manage fine, also let's ignore learned whole experience. always wind spending ridiculous amount time talking weekend next weekend. figure bill time as. individual level, data strongly suggests wearing mask largely pointless individual fully vaccinated. reason we're making vaccinated people wear masks unvaccinated take vaccination program gets them.

From logic, people already wearing masks space, hurt anything fully vaccinated take well. course, moral risk contributing creating environment unvaccinated person feels okay wearing mask spreading another unvaccinated person gym.

You free make choices. Yeah. post misleading click-baity title. title implies they'd mic drop peace out, what's actually case they're likely look different job better aligned work location preferences. I'm going vacation Boston NYC 2 months I'm thinking NYC 100% normal work part global team, spend time video calls even people city since there's fair chance we'll need bring one US, south American, APAC guys. Whether I'm office makes zero difference, call. 

I've set expectation go 2 days every two weeks. Seems reasonable enough me. become really rough well. Pretty much top bottom top again. think much policy people stopped giving fuck though. tons travel holidays indoor gatherings. see way stopping that. 

Given nothing previous admin, thing I'd change try outdoor dining bit longer help financial burden. possible. I've pretty isolated past 12-13 mos. I'd idiot think zero impact mental health. “If numbers amazing cases extremely low think also everyone opportunity supply get shots may change mask mandate may lifted time too,” Gandhi said think return office spend free time looking WFH jobs giving eventually  Nothing covered up, data became apparent investigated. wanted cover up, would kept covering up.

also MHRA neither government NHS. think natural process people. triggers thought something needs change. decide downsize move closer job, like moving house 1bd apartment. Others decide go seek lower paying job closer home. putting insanity, pay expense loss, time loss. 

I feel like driving 100 miles work 5 days week kind thing would last couple weeks. can’t take longer click one’s brain it’s worth it. Oh yea they’ll find remote careers right away... exactly doing? Understanding risks taking informed decision?

It seems one going anecdote rather data. best solution allowing people make choice current rates would take 20 days Brazil overtake UK per capita deaths. I'd surprised within next month so. CEO company trade comment said wanted people back office 80% time private office (open areas people childcare issues still WFH). exact words were, “if people able entire job home I’m going find someone another country 25% price.” love remote work specially I’m software engineer exponentially cheaper work office, pay parking fees stay home pay darn costly electricity. Twice week office based fine me. also need recharge social life. Many teacher adults working home also checked out. I'm opposite. I'd quit job work home. love coming office... again, three young kids home - office safe place. Probably also doesn’t include wasted time. used spend 2 hours commuting every day total definitely didn’t see $50 every day. ones kept touch ones good relationship outside work.

For example, UI dev team ran one helpdesk minions WMA event, wound training together couple years. They're DevOps chat least week, they're one company I'm still touch with. Finding job always easy willing relocate since people aren't. remeber happening late last year, places starting bringing kids full time work even zoom classes. started seeing cash flow never wanted go back. really make money traveling work agree context important (as always), think people surprised learn lot cases people already issues. point is, though, Covid made likely recurrence, whereas infections didn't. 

I agree, though, lumping neurological issues 1-in-3 numbers little silly. 100 M&amp;Ms 32 red 1 green would say ""one 3 red green"" Same, day go office lunch longer go new restaurants. Also coffee breaks longer. thats bad thing tbh. Working home hours longer average. personally subway today heading Kungsholmen Gamla Stan around 9a would put average people wearing masks train around 70%. I've seen people wearing masks bus, particularly ride often. agree malls significantly less usage.   
   
I'm saying perfect example, government finally said wear masks, people wearing masks Asian descent. total 51 women 28 men aged 18 79 affected Professor Sir Munir Pirmohamed, chair commission human medicines, said evidence women predilection develop blood clots Oxford jab.  thats ""all is"" mgmt........theres always 2 managers 10 working ass 8 fuck off.

Kid, ive game *long time*. hold mgmt responsibilities myself.  Youre welcome think whatever want...but organizations dumb shit.

Be seen, seem important, get promoted colleagues busy...taking care business.  Oh dear...not Margaret Thatcher quote.  


Don't think going ""effect"" thought would looool!

Cute try though office allowed sweatpants maybe I’d excited go back. easy say quit. Let's see many people actually it. Since covid 19 cases rising everywhere, employees avoid stepping out, quite logical.  crazy compare monthly cost car (\~$706/mo). Yup, year wfh saved 20 days life commute time alone. Crazy. mostly full-time wfh pandemic, telecommuting going requirement future It’s four step production chain far know. 

Step 1: extracting DNA bacteria
Step 2: using DNA create RNA
Step 3: coating RNA lipids mix fluid
Step 4: filing vials quality control

As far know, step 1 always done Pfizer US, step 2 done several BioNTech sites Europe, step 3 EU either BioNTech Marburg Pfizer Puurs, Belgium. Step 4 done either external contractors like Delpharm France Pfizer Puurs. 

So many different sites making medical wonder possible. It’s huge chain don’t think people appreciate much work make vaccines. Screw that. life? Depending state, yes. think every Brit Reddit nationalist one shitty sub shitty posts, think anyone disagrees definitely British nationalist, pretty much thing. long look mirror mate. born equator. like heat lol Good luck that. Companies don’t give shit preferences. buy city. tax rate land high. apartment offset tenants building. example, buy 3 bedroom house desirable middle-class neighborhood tri state, would 3300 month (taxes mortgage. square footage, co-op queens, talking around 2200-2300 month 130/month metrocard. Stop lying. prevalence anxiety, mood disorders, multi-systemic physical symptoms (headache, exhaustion) people survived *any* potentially life threatening disease? connection emotional centers brain physical systems, everything cognitive function gastrointestinal processes, incredibly complex well understood. suspect part that's what's going here, make less real painful. harder treat.  That’s good point actually. I’ve office last 6 weeks I’m transition home. feel like I’m less monitored micromanaged I’m actually here. 

At home track every single click long task takes whatever spyware use. sorta sit desk sometimes stuff people walk lol. try fluvoxamine Yeah it’s weird many people thread assuming experiences MUST universal. guess that’s year isolation Working office scam part. 

Why corporations claim sort green initiative tax cut let everyone stay home, count commuting decrease CO2, done deal every accident avoided never remove humanity equation. still live wind/solar areas. problem entirely humanity nuclear, dont get wrong im saying use it. need to. im going pretend can't huge consequences. Seeing hostile political climate become toward regulations nuclear could easily become dangerous rabbit hole. 

(one safest, safest)

again nuclear needs used solar wind hydro first pick cheaper anyway. cant cut sure go nuclear. non US-citizens supposed know that? Good point comes training new people. Believe me, problem required office months come speed. Lots use cases too. Unfortunately experience, individuals belief M-F 8-5 office matter what. 
Type folks like meeting sake meeting resolved email conversation.

I believe open minded understand situations best person. 

We starting see push talks returning office. dynamics play interesting observe watch. suburbs uniquely wasteful american thing. 

I disagree you, personally I'd prefer small place city big one suburbs, change people buy whatever afford. medium density housing instead suburbs we'd happier, exist can't create want it. used condom I've also seen parenting groups, people saying upped milk production this, plus office usually kept freezing cold whereas home comfortable feel fingers type. miss nonsense. make rent increase? Unless get place extra room create workspace, though that's case see ""office"" main living space haha. mild covid took anti infl. heart problems 2 months. im 100% shit. made lot people lazy. get ready go work sit home nothing. opposed cooped inside office? Yeah im sure people would prefer it. People choice. like cut jib. said that. he's important me. im frustrated told im important enough keep locking longer people. quit get replaced anyone world lower COL area fraction salary flip side, stopping *you* moving somewhere cheaper landing job lets live like king, comparatively? Even inside country, high-paying jobs overwhelmingly available extremely expensive locations. expensive because... lot competition lot real estate due area's great work prospects (and factors, sure, clearly biggest one)

Clearly able disperse people bit instead dealing incredible inefficiencies involved compressing many people possible little land possible is, priori, *good thing*. 

In hypothetical extreme free-for-all (that never going happen, sake argument) would expect cost living standard salaries roughly equalize everywhere globally. currently really great thing going, may end downgrade you. people, chances might even sizable upgrade. discount possibility hand salary would likely drop -- cost living drops *more*, end ahead. interesting nicely distributed desired outcome splits:

Hybrid 49%

Fully Remote: 26%

Fully Office: 25% save two hours day commute, mandatory 1 hour lunch break (where would normally get bothered work-related issues) spent dishes/laundry/other home chores. basically 3 hours extra day.

Or words, double free time normally would weekday. really hope workplace provides hybrid schedule option inevitably start asking us come back office. true, gastrointestinal protection, systemic protection. Breast milk mostly IgA antibodies, coat baby's gut protect baby gastrointestinal infections, important access clean drinking water. Covid primarily infect respiratory tract, antibodies gut would offer significant protection it. Completely topic, sound like Brit. look comment history get feeling wrote this. right? brother law 28 29 side effects. wife 39 side effects parents 60s side effects.  two friends 40s side effects knows hits people others See, get ""I occasionally want around people"" thing - (post-pandemic) I'd rather grab pint pub go stuffy office. Idk. 

Hopefully WFH hybrid schedules offered going forward. Would cut carbon output. One old bosses pretended big family guy. cranked half dozen kids Jesus. Yet worked late frequently lived far home. said commute favorite part day, pushed oldest 18, wife said came home dicked around twitter every single day. gave responsibilities dutifully since busy shit too... uncommitted time twitter.

He fucking hated family. costs live suburb NYC transportation expensive. purely post WW2 advertising. Dude totally relate this. I’ve done mixed remote years well. hated go office bullshit meeting something. No, John accounting, don’t give shit think weather. always non-stop people coming desk talk.

Thankfully company fully embraced remote work continue pandemic ends. people complaining ones kids saying need get away them. Hey idiots, back school shit over. I've happen before. Every time would happen, could help think meager 25 cent raise insult &amp; raises dollar amounts. Like $1.00 raise instance. wanted sound like old person get excited quarter like 5 year old. 

Ugh...i'm grown adult, need greedy assholes. also, taking temperature guests lot visible less costly say, upgrading building's ventilation system.  still socializing workplace, doesn’t “chilling mates”. small conversation, saying hello people on. every work place awful, employment may suck, people actually enjoy theirs. main reason US export any/much vaccine uses themselves. Half vaccinations produced EU exported. better approach opinion, also means longer shortages. comment linking Etsy.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

They'll buy ever they're ""Sold"". lawn happiness. suburbs uniquely wasteful american thing.  k  cases first dose I’m you, don’t really like working home. live small apartment alone, separate space work must. live within walking distance office commute. could probably fine teleworking one two days week, much productive office setting. honestly think part people work worked full time work probably enough work working home could consolidate positions fewer positions decided permanent WFH policy. we're shit hole Texas, there's much risk workforce returning work preCovid policy would endanger many people, also open appointments everyday vaccinations half state stupid vaccinate be. say I'm getting vaccinated people ask I'm worried risks later I've taken every vaccine sun including Anthrax supposed risk back day nothing, wife huge pro-vaccine advocate get kids every available vaccine there. building housing cities near jobs people commute much.

Unfortunately, anti-development elements already using pandemic excuse oppose urban housing. idea could best time. finally starting warm MN winter exactly lot outdoor activities events going on. post Nextdoor (I deleted Facebook summer) asking anyone knew softball teams looking two more, luck.

I've met best friends work. None internet. Ok. I’ve advocating 4x10’s, least 9x80 schedule now, since graduating college. understand people’s hesitancy toward 10 hour work day, every Friday schedule awesome. You’re rushing two days trying get things done. day Friday errands, saturday/Sunday relax. One weirdest things pandemic nobody's done anything fucking idiots ruining countries. 

I realize big changes require overcoming lot inertia, globally would expected one two terrible leaders wind decorating lamp posts capitols now. Maybe I’m confused saying want confirm assume. saying allowing people get shot, cause deaths? still deductible taxes, complete refund. help bit though. Using incandescent bulbs 2021. run whale oil? ""new normal"" describe concerns me. I'm single, live alone, strict possible covid precautions. basically lived life year. I'm young asthma. taken tremendous toll mental health sent repeatedly spiraling depression.

Anyway, I've vaccinated now, honest ~80% population vaccinated june, I'm done covid precautions. Burn mask everything. can't anymore. goal can't zero, drag forever. Life pandemic life.

I think precautions necessary stop disease kill 500k ppl usa year, stop one kill 5k ppl year, make numbers right there.

I feel I'm tip iceberg here. lots people willing follow guidelines all. People like going flat stop vaccinations get far enough. need consider consequences flat ignored majority population. happen.

This end. 2022. NOW. new dangerous variant discovered, see reason covid precautions summer. That's self-own think is. inner-city job outsourced rural area lower salary says nothing capability either employee, everything difference cost living. Ah, social anxiety well - took exact direction, lol. keeping brain work thoughts, youtube. throwing streamers playing among us background. talk other, act ""social background noise"" me. dog also helps. I'm talking meeting days. got 4.5 hours worth meetings different teams, sprint reviews, business sponsors, etc get done point week

I that....easily done remotely yet see high paying WFH job require full time  Bud, live Long Island. housing crisis. policy crisis. reason land lording full time job. Make tax rate capital gains rental property high top tax rate NY. think key. going become perk job role, like PTO 401k matching sorts things. 

My concern though companies use wage increases eventually. think every perk balance point. job-hopping economy, could see companies offering far less wages WFH time, instead raise, give additional 2-5 days WFH time. Brazil extremely unlucky next election still year half away. Absolutely zero incentive Bolsonaro even pretend give single damn. Yeah, I'm super introverted disability leave work. know exactly cut long takes start miss people, somewhere around 2 months. Outdoors you’re advised avoid crowds can’t wear mask.  dont want job completely tied lives?

How working home ties live job? Please explain.

Would answer phone hours would working office? Probably like driving. mom commute San Bernardino country CA Orange county CA 40 years hated it. dad drove whenever day off. Silver linings \*think\* said known cases first dose, none second. course second doses much lower. Pfizer given earlier spacing doses 12 weeks would probably smaller portion 6 mil second doses AZ. Bit late, also fault national governments allowing Commission spend manufacturing. remember opened beaches marinas last year Redditors screaming murdering people. wiped groceries first couple months data clear spread. though pretty apparent transmits via groups people indoors really unique opportunity work towards better climate right now, less people commute work means less harmful shit spewed atmosphere.

It would also combat lot congestion problems densely populated areas like cities big towns.

It would also give councils opportunity much needed upgrades fixes infrastructure, like potholes old roads becoming loose.


It pisses fucking blind UK government this. SEE... right. remove ToxicSteve13 comment. Hypocrites. in-person collaboration essential 

In field? Well, one way find wants first try health authorities announced similar vaccine safe enough? 

I curious see handled. live Denmark expect health authority make decision line Norway. Retail! feet day, moving around, busy. Moving light loads physical stuff too. could worked would counting minutes go home. 

Could handled factory jobs know - put effort thinking brain slow. Couldn’t handled something like processing line meatpacking plant. cost. buildings went 100% air exchange would likely collapse electric power gird natural gas distribution system. said filters likely key along modest increase outside air exchange. speak job finance, confidently say could get english speaking person who's reasonably competent (nothing crazy) see drop quality vs. sound salty/envious fuck balls good enough grandchild care elderly grandparents. was? strict return office mandate laid board cost us senior people last months. really quit stay home jobs instead coming back. Early on, sanitizing groceries, quarantining them. became clear 4-6 months ago surface transmission degree likely happening. read article one lab scientists part surface transmission experiment made everyone freak out, said he, himself, sanitize groceries. stopped pretty much immediately that. type person always assume safety first, I'll first stop needless practice proven waste time. one going believe interim. side. Lockdown proponents need acknowledge change strategies accordingly.

The best is:

1. Vaccinate
2. Keep masking-up
3. INFORM public activities best: limit gatherings 15 people outdoors try gather indoors much can. That's it. Nothing else efficient. adult Curaçaoans receive first injection within ten days tomorrow. State Secretary Blokhuis reports Twitter: ""The corona situation Curaçao serious. reduce pressure healthcare, accelerating vaccination Netherlands supports island extra vaccines, care workers logistical support. call, hundreds healthcare workers offered help corona care number infections island increasing rapidly. Ministry Interior called Dutch holidaymakers interns Curaçao leave island stay strictly necessary. guess can't go back normal 2021 hope lost. Oh well, need normality now. let poors die. That's country normally anyways taken meaningful steps last year improve health reduce risk?

I’ve got family members Hopkins indicated quite vaccinated people getting infected there. foreign outsourcing ought concerned - domestic well.

You pay equally qualified worker Billings, MT fraction pay say Seattle example.

They phones, internet, American accents Billings, too! understand pandemic 14-15 months old pretending 2-4 months delay nothing. that's case open every thing 2-4 months? downplaying devastating effect pandemic order cover mess German/EU vaccination been. science isn’t settled side-effects shot. Stop actively trying gaslight people decide don’t want try this. I’m already immune Feb 2019 lasted days. Taking vaccine doesn’t make sense I’m already immune. Christ’s sake people today born Nazi Germany they’d 100% Nazis. saying you, know mean.  Pick 1:

a) Can't drive

b) Lack parking

c) car

d) insured

e) Suspended license

f) Medical reasons

g) OP indebted way

h) Still cheaper taxi/public transport

etc. think make really great points reflects not-obvious choices are. would worry marginalization bring up. 

I don’t claim right answers. I’m willing trial-and-error ways make job livable. Amazon N95s available prime now. looks like political dispute.   shortages are. Ah yes...I left folks out. intentional. 

They know COVID19 dangerous - President Trump stated Woodward interviews. continued spread lies public severity virus, wanted virus spread. 

Certain types Americans want specific demographics suffer virus -which early on, rumor spread people color immune virus. Excellent answer! Thanks new sources info thanks service. We'll beat thing. Lol wtf supposed believe? I’ve heard: don’t wear masks, wear masks, it’s unsafe gather crowds like church, sporting events Trump rallies (you’re literally killing grandma), it’s ok gather social justice protests (grandma understand killed her), social distance, social distance isn’t effective good air filtration, get vaccine nothing changes - rules still apply, get vaccine you’re around people vaccine wtf want. 

If think know facts, wait minute. want 100% office, 0% office others between. job create infrastructure processes support above.

This right answer. Everyone opinion somewhere two extremes. Personally want 0% find minority. true let homebodies like carry bringing rest office much like? likely low risk activity it’s important note outdoor dining banned Ireland lot pandemic estimate based measures place here. Wait wait wait, telling people stupid enough believe magical sky wizard also stupid get vaccinated? STOP PRESS Technically not, although pretty easy infer.

Calling medical procedure stretch worked in-office remote teammate. Whenever came town, got way less done novelty, felt like holiday. rest time, basically worked.

That said, offices stupid tech workers. That’s democracy works reason work office 1 day even, thats 20% increase (kind of.. 0/5 1/5). people even saying ""flexibility"" fine??? 20 percent increase? 0 days optimal unless WANT return agree, public caring truancy issues going decades. I’m moderna clinical trial. Moderna found 50 micrograms effective 100 microgram dose, 100 micro dose way shelf stable. That’s moderna vaccine stored 30 days regular refrigerator still usable. There’s way could Pfizer vaccine, degrades much quickly. downside 100 microgram dose chances “robust immune response” (side effects, call them) goes little bit. That’s works lmao trouble finding definitive information exercising taking Pfizer vaccine.

Schools always required vaccinations. Flip side, I’m software developer almost never feels whiteboard sessions useful. I’ve were, sure, part, person interactions aren’t needed. don’t need help job, give stories set loose, white boarding, tech meetings fluff don’t need day. 

I wouldn’t mind one two days week office person tasks, much prefer working without others around distract useless bullshit You’re 18? sure old are? Every discussion this, someone brings really flawed Qatar study. things like count people weeks first infection. Well yeah, nobody thinks reinfections would common short time. many issues, like time period infections begin with, etc. 

I understand practical argument making mattering whether new infection residual, think thing practical sense either. rate residual effects infection stay fairly constant, true reinfections would likely grow time, example. 

Bottom line - data. real testing large scale, know. vaccinated month ago Correlation equal causation what, did, message mods complain. respected news conglomerates

Like saying picking dry end piece shit good. read even findings paragraph see talking anxiety. can't see insurance companies let lot companies get away without vaccine mandate. Resorts, cruises, even schools probably forced make sure people fully vaccinated. twat. typos comment make little hard understand, read guess goal okay severity

""downplay severity"", I'm guessing felt think covid serious enough explaining study results? think explicitly reading tables anything downplaying. argument choose side try make covid either really really scary, almost nothing. totally okay explain actual result people. said ""So 1 9 develop new neurological psychiatric problem."" study found. good people know diagnoses people already had. Truth also leaving compared incidence effects covid vs populations viral infections. Covid much likely cause effects.

I say neurological conditions (intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, myoneural junction muscle disease) increase risk significantly compared flu respiratory tract mood, anxiety, sleep problems reasonable common patients, especially continuing suffered issues covid.

I guess quibble mention mood/anxiety/psychotic disorder, also significant, 1.2 times risk covid patients compared RTIs (1.18 non-hospitalized)? guess that's fair - covid causing psychiatric conditions flu/other RTIs. hazard ratio much smaller neurological effects, think important lay person consider.

You correct actually explicitly model hospitalized vs non, missed table 5. change interpretation table, correct study explicitly analyse this, seem much common hospitalized ICU patients, whereas anxiety mood disorders difference smaller (non-hospitalized first anxiety 6.81% compared ICU first anxiety 9.79%, example).

to find much common hospitalized ICU patients, whereas anxiety mood disorders difference smaller (non-hospitalized first anxiety 6.81% compared ICU first anxiety 9.79%, example, hazard ratio 1.39 comparing ICU non-ICU). restrictions influenced passport.

And issue fundamentally government backing passport app system /u/Wizmaxman, posts literally single useful pieces information sub.

If going allow here, I'd follow posts subreddit posted profile. Concerned what? vaccinated months ago. think it’s safety theatre little efficacy huge downsides Everyone super-spreader bad information.

Must sterilize surfaces. kidding, probably get can't COVID surfaces.

Do wear masks. kidding, probably wear 2.

I sense impending doom. see light end tunnel.

Must close schools. Kids less likely spread community large.

WHO's dance appeasement China.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole thing informational clusterfuck. wonder people suspicious they're told.

&amp;#x200B;

Social distance, wear mask, get vaccine. truths need  Depending age, 60-100 rhr considered normal. Ah yes, I’m anti vaxx I’ve polio tetanus jab. Get high ground kiddo. vaccine? Get vaccinated asap Look I’ll admit that’s stupid don’t absolve “both sides” idiotic beliefs, wanna pretend equatable thing, well, need head checked. Furthermore, inability properly identify percentage poll question accessing information I’m referring to. But, good point? mother screaming Republican. left leaning independent thanks Trump. Public Heath sadly often involved politics actual science. Usually posts like deleted ""political"", important give little bit context it, article lacking it.

Bosnia essentially functional country. terrible mash two entities, Federation Bosnia Herzegovina, croat-muslim government heavily pro-west pro-EU, Republika Srpska, ethnic serbian rebel republic aligned Serbia Russia.

Everything done country suffers division disagreement. Probably european friendly side expecting help EU never came. Serbian part country managed procure small amount Sputnik V vaccines. Everyone vaccinated Bosnia either thanks due charity Serbia, mortal enemy. 

Further help Serbia difficult achieve. Pro-european outlets already framing Serbia ""political gaming"" ""genocide white washing"". 

The sad situation Bosnia finds everything geopolitical problems, fail see government could achieve unless something really drastic happened to. Bosnians, left driving Belgrade getting shot there.

Also, according Timatic negative test already needed enter Bosnia. either protesters writer clueless. ""Just half surveyed WFH employees (49%) said would prefer hybrid work arrangement, dividing time office another location. Likewise, 26% said want remain fully remote, 25% wanted return full-time office situation."" That’s stupid. It’s basically reason come here. It’s really conspiracy theory one United States largest states fact using covid passport app system allows certain freedom using it

NY. can’t stand people gaslighting multiple western democracies American states implementing covid passport discussing isn’t somehow reasonable sign covid passports domestically occur It’s stuff pneumonia found Yeah sure, forced medical interventions preety ok, decide need sex change attend. sound like would without question Cruise ships floating Petri dishes, COVID get you, legionnaires, hepatitis A, norovirus will. nations, would question ""if how"" interview process manipulated. example, Asian Boss credible? interviewing 100 people taking top 10 make sense? translation they're providing accurate? 

A lot performed US massive obvious bias. political groups like Project Veritas, Rebel Media (Cdn), also talk shows like Jimmy Kimmel these. Kimmel, assume they're taking best interviews they're entertainment want show bizarre, show one 8-year old end makes sense prior adults. 

You also consider Dunning–Kruger effect. presence camera cause certain portion population voluntarily interviewed - either fear looking stupid camera, trust media. another portion public willing approach camera without fear looking foolish, want camera. 

Fact is, viewer watch video. background research determine provided legitimate trusted source. Sometimes obvious, often isn't, lot people going research all. Norwegian Cruise Line, minors haven’t yet become eligible vaccine permitted sail initial voyages October. line stated “follow latest science” determine requirements sailings beginning Well, thought Chilean government country passing highest point infections (although think lower positivity previous peak)

To fair, vaccines applied Chile Sinovac less efficient Pfizer etc although clear differences hospitalization ratio that's one important point jobs can't outsourced, nobody understands healthcare reimbursement US convulted. Job security. They're currently experiencing third wave. 

America experiencing another surge despite denial redditors, yet nobody blaming pfizer/moderna. Interesting! bad article overall, think kid disrespectful refer Sweden's strategy ""experiment"" implies focus Swedish response collect data rather care population. Ha would say it’s bit “improperly identify percentage poll” like massively misinformed rate severity factor 25-50x. want around him/her don’t want around you. [From 236 379 patients diagnosed COVID-19, estimated incidence neurological psychiatric diagnosis following 6 months 33·62% (95% CI 33·17–34·07), 12·84% (12·36–13·33) receiving first diagnosis.

OK, two thirds people affected already affected prior getting COVID-19. I'm unsurprised COVID-19 failed cure anxiety cohort. diagnostic categories common patients COVID-19 influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 1·44, 95% CI 1·40–1·47, diagnosis; 1·78, 1·68–1·89, first diagnosis) respiratory tract infections (1·16, 1·14–1·17, diagnosis; 1·32, 1·27–1·36, first diagnosis)

I think writing headline, would gone ""COVID-19 survivors 16% likely neurological mental disorders people respiratory tract infection. course, write headlines living, one's going click that.  ""He never said children 20, flu deadlier"" irrelevant information. Would making flu statement make Covid kill children? No, reason say it. lead example though (Biden wearing masks, Trump not) matter. Also direct emergency relief hospitals. probably it’s vaccine rollout feds help - negotiating national purchases vaccines, coordinating % allocated state, etc, mention science funding vaccine research. I’ll say one thing Trump’s Republican Congress, awful many ways, continually ignored proposals gut funding NSF &amp; NIH actually increased budgets (before pandemic), paid big time last year. illness hyped right (not unreasonably) would infe results fear long-term consequences much long-term effects. 

I'm trying downplay significance it; severe illness. Still, much attention focused anxiety surrounding heightened compared serious diseases. Correlation causation. show data lockdowns achieved fuck all, cases fell *despite* restrictions relatively lax. Czechia strict lockdown several months recently top COVID deaths per capita. Poland, despite introducing relatively restrictions November (compared rest Europe), saw dramatic fall number new cases October. Understood. I’m talking company skews young extroverted maybe? technically could be, but

There need 'but' here. know nothing person making assumptions based that: nothing. Arsenal season ticket holder - weird feeling - paying £1,200 year disappointed angry. That's biggest issue u got man? Alright, I'm 17 then. Get it, feel relief wash you. want normal senior year HS/freshman year college? hang friends? it. :) think conflating good management adherence company policies personal risk management understanding pandemic.

CFA employees masked better personally taking pandemic seriously at, say, McDonald's Arby's. They're masked better top company made priority. 

Their masking probably translate well outside pandemic. knowing demographics various places, I'd put stake CFA workers taking less seriously restaurants. say you’re 18 say you’re 17, IMO “about 18” sounds silly. really water solar windmills way safer. one TikToker made video “Times news story” headline along lines saying: “did know covid 19 vaccine (instead scary sounding ingredients here)” zoomed holding bag Cheetos said “actually what’s inside bag Cheetos, news article made myself” “don’t believe everything see internet”. ....it really shows easy make convincing fake news article. depends. mean Wuhan-style lockdowns welded people buildings March 2020 Italy style lockdowns barricaded roads one allowed except food medicine, yes agree work. US Europe never effective lockdowns, always many exceptions, really put restaurants/bars/gyms/small retailers business.  one believes numbers coming China China. Yeah there'll reckoning coming Redditors acting they're going force companies implement hybrid schedules WFH.

Either companies outsource start giving do. hey commuting handle extra workload. large-scale, wartime like effort produce vaccine vaccinate? Especially since, know long antibodies vaccine last, could yearly ordeal? Schools open places since September without problems happening Michigan. There’s still spread, NYC, schools open albeit limited capacity, haven’t child driven problems we’re seeing Michigan Mass.

I agree waiting open schools contagious variant came bad idea especially schools going open 3 months. job strictly 8-5 expectations outside that, feel like that’s becoming rarer rarer. really feel people whose bosses expect available night. really can't find way reconciliate 2 sources. :o

Only thing I'm thinking somehow german funding BioNtech counted american, Pfizer leader american ? think people would prefer hybrid work, problem doesn’t really incentivize employer. 

In theory, employers would open WFH opportunities post-pandemic savings come it. rent, utility, maintenance, cleaning expenses running office. hybrid schedule, employers lose savings employer still provide physical location employees come in. employee, also lose you’re tied city physical office in. 

My guess employers draw line sand point full WFH full office going forward. think people want 100% though allowed. job, literally ever need office, fax issues actually forced integrate programs digitally fax things yeah, never want go back honestly. guidelines, FDA's EUA's permit vaccination people 16+. EUA includes ""pediatric use"" section includes language like ""Emergency Use Authorization \[company's\] COVID-19 Vaccine include use individuals younger 16 years age."" (eg would absolutely legal clinic administer vaccine 15-year-old would violate FDA regulations.

That said, presumably *individual person* tries get vaccinated anything illegal, would entirely clinic. like... probably worth try, almost definitely turn away young. answer you: nothing. nothing let people die. fuck took poll? come, really want know this. almost 11 years ive reddit.

ive seen polls year year week week. Yet ive never seen information part polls.

Thanks! Hey, that's item snack machine day help power extra work. gratitude? /s Yeah won’t. genuinely understand you’re trying say, agree sentiment frankly. op’s intent inform, always, removed should. flu vaccine 39% effective last year 29% year that. But, people take vaccine go lives. covid vaccine 3x effective likely taken far I’m someone literally tone everything personality, interests, hobbies, thoughts comes coworkers, they’re largely total fucking squares.

I too, coworkers probably percieve square it. I’m laughing thinking everybody hiding full personalities, thinking thier coworkers boring squares, everybody else too. It’s safer. Whats going Biden admin? widely reported working many big tech companies develop vaccine passports weeks ago press conference said going implement federal vaccine database/ passport system. There's weird bias happens grocery store people assume safe they've gone hundreds times never gotten sick (to knowledge). got covid-like illness last March grocery store (no testing available time). literally gone anywhere else live alone definitely grocery store.

The one that's really baffling friend-of-a-friend severe asthma basically shut-in trying avoid catching somehow still caught it. friends dropping groceries door-- totally contactless, afraid leave apartment even go walks. assumes caught common areas building, maybe elevator something. Maybe bad ventilation units somehow? knows. boat man.

Personally know plenty reasonable people want send kids back plenty reasonable people want wait vaccine. I’m glad district working both. Got pfizer sore arm couple days. pain nearly bad pain tetanus shots. live closer work first place. I'll never understand people voluntarily commute like 5 miles full support social justice.

But us organized thousands friends masks outside would labeled super spreader event would shamed worldwide:  [200601-protest-social-distancing-mn-1115\_388999f5c941c282390001885a2617cf.fit-2000w.jpg (2000×1320) Scientists notoriously bad communicating stupid people. 

Fauci could said “research shows people received Moderna trials still protected” may gotten point across. people hear something like “six months” ignore context. 

It’s like said “we don’t know” vaccinated people spread covid. said “there reason believe vaccinated people spread covid, currently working confirming this.” Pessimists stay home cover education expenses far I'm concerned. Still stopping fall ludicrous. time, pandemic given vast majority workers experience remote working, well local offices managers. US workforce could lot competitive outsourcing now, lot barriers US, like said, torn down. Hiring remote workers US provide many advantages outsourcing, plus many benefits hiring local employees. think early say increase outsourcing. anything, offers alternative it. think lot companies realize jobs might outsourced would even better handled remote workers US. That’s :) don’t know could work productive 9-5 (remote on-site) staying touch friends beyond handful texts/calls/emails.

Especially since they’re probably boat.

“Get discord something” impressively half-assed solution problem doesn’t actually one. Remote work, works. Say now! Commuting definitely sucks. still wanna talk coworkers person without delay, webRTC. mean giant internet cafés, hunker down, pay premium meeting rooms private rooms, otherwise buy coffees lunches hang out? 

Yeah that's exactly I'm thinking.  Many malls even abundance hidden office areas quiet. surprised well worn abandoned cubicles set already. need fancy me.  quiet partitioned please. Consulting/engineering news website conflated them.

If airborne, would infected almost everyone building, instead people chorister projecting spittle onto. data set merged UK.  difference fact CDC condone alcohol consumption mean bars country closed.

However, CDC never saying covid situation ok lead widespread closures businesses activities.

If recommendations wide consequences, need balanced impacts continued closures.  So? Kids ones dying. fall, adults offered dose, matters.

There reason accommodate d*omers. chance real factor though!

What need time work yourself.

We schedule either lunch happy hour least month. hour long talk whatever. guess lucky enough company allows this, goes back intentionality. want people successful happy, work it.

The goes hour. put make conversations happen. everyone goes thinking work, won't.

At last one, got talking food. Weird stuff people eaten. Restaurant recommendations. like good conversation friends. throw towel/blanket mine like I'm kind African gray parrot. first Pfizer vax yesterday noon. I’m 57. sore arm mild headache base skull bedtime. Today, another story. I’m getting worse day progresses. Headache much, much worse. Fever, severe body aches, sore throat (from swollen lymph nodes, think) exhaustion present. head feels like it’s going explode. 

If second dose makes body react even worse, I’m getting it. Covid proved bulk knowledge work done remotely save company money.

The thing that’s hard remotely boss hover pretend actually benefits company existing. Go work pants, sent home wanted, plus pants home either win-win. one would work holidays weekends. would society function? kinda argument that? also offload sanitation costs onto employees shit home? cost always existed cost previously exist anymore. passing lol. I’m concerned companies data jobs previously known productive remotely. mean giant internet cafés, hunker down, pay premium meeting rooms private rooms, otherwise buy coffees lunches hang out? 

Quiet areas here, social areas there. dream along time QA Engineer, I've watched developers general attitude end spending far time working story poorly understood, meet business requirements full bugs. I'm proponent good planning/grooming actually spend less time story overall. job transitioning work home next year, I'm dreading it. month working home beginning Pandemic. think I'm cut-out it. I'm type person works best there's people around (a Tom Haverford, will). understand working lot people, think me.  lost business pandemic. I’m trying start thanks asking. would say flex schedule would 3 days home 2 days office. might even go light hours office days hell 8 hours. hybrid, you’re still tied geographically. Fully remote, travel over. Go different beaches mountains whatnot also weekly happy hour Friday work hours after. Chill, talk, play group games like jackbox. People pretty unmotivated Friday afternoons general something work related gives something look forward to.  Complicated issue. Title 42 enables hiring high-level expert staff important.

In long emergency response, hard keep people getting burned out, especially regular job getting neglected. important surge capacity, including staffing.

The contract issue broader, cuts across federal government. really done hide headcount (under Bush administration), certainly positions contracting makes lot sense. I’ll go start business right now. where’s pesky capital? would probably quit couldn’t return office least part time. One company (around hundred employees) city live introduced concept couple years pandemic fine.

While people spend days office it, ones know still happy work simply staying home rains outside simply feel like great them.

I guess boils perspective. single person living alone, definitely want zero days outside, work met great people expand social circle. Actually, even family, still think changing surrounding (both social physical) regularly would feel like must.

Also happen live within walking distance office commute big factor -- think perks remote work option, first thing comes mind able rent apartment somewhere seaside couple weeks summer work there. :)

Though guess worry model ""win"" -- great thing seems big range different opinions preferences I'm sure companies might go fully remote, stay loyal office hybrid model. Employee loyalty thing anymore anyway, big chunk people opportunity find employer suits them. Outdoor walking outside 5km banned. worked home 3 years definitely went stir crazy lot. would always get house go store something. really missed interactions coworkers. situation work home 2-3 days week seems ideal get 8 hours office work done 5 working home. huge stress reliever focus details distracted stuff. I'm looking forward going back office. hate working home miss friends fun events. mention EU bad job, comparing US. Obviously pretty much every Asian country much better EU, Australia many others. Yawn.  long tax payers keep paying survive (and spend money things like tvs stock investments)? Well especially since y'all insist driving wrong side road! Believe there's even label them: extroverts. sample sizes small really precise incidence curve shows greatest benefit occurring right day 11 (90%+ probably?) small improvements error bars shown, huge. measuring something completely different - contagious test positive. biggest benefit comes days 7-12, there's another jump week second dose.  answer this, appease people like working home can't. coworker 8mb internet. pretty much reason even considering remote work. job done 100% remote printer/scanner would happily buy one pocket go least 2-3 days work home. increased costs outweigh time getting ready commuting transportation costs, office appropriate clothing, shoes future health costs feet made them, waste-of-time lunch hour, etc.?

The thing think people may needed get decent desktop serious work phone/piece shit chromebook laptop hold to. Jesus christ. Nearly everyone know felt bit rough jab like flu jab. dunno you’re getting insane reaction fairly innocuous comment. US reliable contract tracing data analyze. truck work. drive 45 min work closer job expensive. pay $50-70 per week travel. $200-300 per month gas costs. really fun. he's part get people part...

Great message, good shit report Ireland stricter Ireland. Nothing open nobody allowed meet. though anyway. Lock downs shown marginally ineffective who?

Your lock skepticism sub? USA. Receiving dose #2 Moderna two weeks. Oh no. dead people littering streets? I've phone calls people work home. Trust me, one wants hear talk kid leave us hold waste time. I'm giving time time kid work. last company saw productivity increase significantly everyone forced work home. Revenue reached time highs company saving money office expenses. 

Literally second legally could, rented new space required employees back office 5 days week. 

Most managers can’t comprehend people capable productive own, without close supervision, even numbers show it’s better company whole. It’s control thing. fact yesterday CA's governor said wanted state fully reopen mid-june gave hopes democrat states follow suit soon, they'd look really dumb imo states mask mandates low rate infections deaths regardless. agree depends job. find end leaning chaotic busy. twiddling thumbs could see would awkward, team we're usually eating lunch calling 5 minute break tasks, running things, asking advice, end day we'll touch base kinda vent craziness day finally slow chat. slower moving job, think I'd want chat reason. chat touch base lot there's lot moving parts collaboration needs quick response follow through. Video chat awesome get know team better True, unlike cold places Chicago people ended dining ""outdoors"" plastic greenhouses, San Francisco actually weather outdoor dining walls lots fresh air. Shame squandered natural advantage! didn’t say 100 hours wasn’t possible Everyone's mentioning hybrid, hope *full* work home becomes acceptable. full WFH, one live anywhere country, like middle nowhere, tiny cost livjng Combination:

* disease recognized low testing rates
* outdoors lower risk
* Many risk already vaccinated infected
* Variants yet dominant there
* Time tell. Hope things stay relatively low. started new job right quarantine (a days) met boss interview.

1 year later, still haven’t met anyone, good relationships planning quitting make go back. Remote work now.  work already said full time remote offered, even though successfully year. part 34%, job market recovers bit absolutely leaving somewhere respects time offers full time work home. commuting sit office 8 hours pretend work whole time, cats bag remote work now. anyone wants see something interesting, start looking daily discussion threads day year Aww people upset actually work now? Thank god. strict measures kept deaths per capita way lower places like Florida lax restrictions. Yes. full protection 14 days second dose. No, right. actually agree point. think silver bullet argument letting people flexible schedules. Could due received vaccine UK? Id imagine younger women would received men given lot younger people work healthcare - predominantly female. that's cases coming 🤔🤔 large company? feel works better smaller companies without many employees keep track WAY true!!!!!!!! Car/ transportation, wardrobe, beauty salon/ haircut, meals, time lost commute, cell phone data, parking, loss time kids, spouse - amounts HELL paycut!!! People also time cook save more$$$$. many stated much saved last year.

Mark words though, tax hikes keep going up, company may leave country matter line work you’re in. new administration bungling everything. one safe, even you👉 Thank you! far good, felt 3 days asked 100 people Texas, “Would support vaccine passport?” 98 said no, would accept methodology? doesn’t fit agenda.

Incorrect. Acceptance methodology based validity methodology, whether results study conform one's personal [Statistics are] mostly bullshit made fit agenda.

Statistics often done poorly made fit agenda. mean impossible correctly. point remains same: possible take sample 800 Americans get accurate measure entire country feels something. pick 800 people tough part, tough correctly. get that, that's good reason drag bunch unwilling people back workplace waste time. Join fucking social club. British would say killing people discouraging people take JJ vaccine.

It clearly stated vaccines blood clot rates expected general population, im sure innocent genuine question is. heart palpitates thinking people walk me, tell send email documentation purposes, allowed anything without electronically written request. work office job even need go least while. can't mail ship things easily apartment. guess might nice kids long commute, absolutely hated working home. single dude tiny apartment, wfh alone day every day hell. cannot wait get back in-person work.  shit face. Eat goddamn dick. got 2nd Pfizer shot yesterday going family member's wedding mid May. I'll okay proximity family recently covid, right? Idk man kinda love able tell people stand fucking close me. Jesus christ still active campaign ban people discussing factual information data. result lot people spent year, far, lives feeding paranoia neuroticism. 

It also increased number people infected spent time inside closed spaces respiratory viruses spread. could outside exercising hanging beach anything else.

People think banning discussion data preventing misinformation case outdoor activity destructive. used work remote take person job laid COVID I’d anything go back remote tbh Same. TDAP rabies vaccine two years ago didn’t disrupt cycle. pay home utilities, sure: 

1) internet pay time, usage, isn’t increased. 

2) AC set temperature day I’m person there. isn’t going noticeably (sure, body heat means spending extra pennies).

3) Food? Company isn’t giving dozen lunches year. I’m paying either way, personal fridge kitchen available real meal massive. 

4) Electricity? laptop doesn’t take much compared personal stuff. That’s really main extra expenditure, it’s maybe couple bucks month. 

5) Equipment. provided laptop extra monitors. use personal monitors. technically wear tear thousands extra cost? twist it, yeah. stuff set personal computer though, added couple extra cables connect work computer. I’m happy use monitors, desk, chair. access office, I’m dropping mouse keyboard. use mine strong preference. 

6) Office space. already myself. understand they’re getting discount paying it, it’s currently additional cost me. didn’t home office, maybe would like go in.

Edit: 

7) I’m city’s minimum water rate. pay flush toilet twice day extra.  office working office entire time seriously considering looking remote job. stay home weeks covid scare great. opposed 1-2 day office week type deal 5 days office stupid. Lol. guess good thing job I'm one hires clients holds purse strings eh? everyone entry level person trying game system. completely base dude, feel honestly sorry anyone works - assuming management kind. work close laptop put sight. sarcasm, try week two. unwork-space workspace hours. still way less time old commute, probably help out. going see class system develop people come office seen committed get recognized promoted often it.

I think he's wrong also highly dependent individual supervisors. keep hybrid schedule probabaly wont put weight employees well. Remember predicted second wave second wave came? enjoy making stupid comments subreddit? Yup, sister's office 3 days home 2 office. *could* Despite reddit wants believe, office jobs terrible. people enjoy social aspect office lifestyle, maybe offices nice place work in, maybe conditions better.

No offense, shocked this? Sounds like opportunity fresh grad new openings 34%! 👏👏👏 say indoor sports already paid stuff computer chair first place, recliner. link implies DNA extraction take place Marburg. impression flown states. could well wrong. crazy know are? FUCKING BALLS quit. Fucking cowards. Slaves. commanded grateful. I'm gonna go way say instead getting social interaction needs met slaving life away someone else's profit, I'd rather work hours week spend rest socializing/leisure...  right. reminds people going move America Trump got elected. many followed through? None? Probably going result here.

Its easy shoot mouth survey, little harder put money mouth given time, surveys usually reveal around 50% people looking leave jobs.

This headline significant might seem. sure sarcasm , thanks laugh either way staff new fully digital world greet new hires via Skype strike conversations. also allow new hires shadow first 90 days allows direct communication peers helps build missing rapport office. also weekly office meetings users encouraged (not required don’t want chore) utilize provided webcams also helps. It’s perhaps pitch idea management. mean shit webcams 20$ piece morale improvement that’s cheap fuck. TBH, seems like influx Californians longer something specific state. seems like nearly every state complains lol. 40/50 states happen, basically norm. anecdotal experience, I've heard complaint people from:
Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, Illinois, Pennsylvania, ohio, Minnesota, Michigan lol F100 company writes software inhouse. 

We used 2 3 meetings day three times week; ruined kind momentum team would get working code. convinced biz move team meetings 1 day, show basically run 6 meetings back back go home 3pm cuz sick day. next 4 days gloriously unscheduled calendar days, clear meetings time put heads down. lot adults struggle social life outside work. School provides easy source socializing, stops, work unless make effort join interest groups/clubs/go bars/etc. I'm California. daughter school entire year, albeit hybrid system. option, 100% remote, hybrid. hybrid half school goes mon/wed half tue/thur. Wow, gross. vehicle? guess that’s cost ok car insurance drive truck commuting easily cost $10-$15 day gas, add lunch easily $20 already. It’s also bars parties games. recent study showed cases rose every location football games held 5000 people present. There’s reason cases increasing wouldn’t also happen here. Damn hate whole line reasoning. It’s like government saying “we’re going lie issue, believe us aspect response”. terrible approach causing harm good. Yep, everyone work must hate lol Ah pass required want park train work. worse lol

The vaccines end need masks. Ignoring fact anti-science.  companies staying remote went remote hybrid. said, companies making dumb decisions. Keeping people home way cheaper. curiousity, much travel US Canada happening closed border? go That’s fine, 50 million vaccine surplus right now. Gotta use got. [Many us I’m relieved. would dark road go down. There's nothing really try people. ""find"" 25k deductions, categories deductions relatively limited. though let's appreciate amazing risk vs charts available UK probably medium exposure risk Europe probably high. 

You may missed footnote pictures, “low risk exposure” chart labeled “roughly equivalent UK March”. 

Presumably, COVID risk UK continue decline vaccination drive continues, “low” chart reasonably seen ceiling COVID risk foreseeable future. love gets specific narrow blame. 
 
In Kent probably call ""Station Road"" variant. Station Road call Jeff's variant.  
 
""He started it. Fucking Jeff!"" Exactly, watching like hawk jobs ever done home. people office clocking 10's hours overtime week way hell much work. fuck around day start working right around people start go home. similar thing happen bonus. Sales team trying get help offered hundred bucks anyone produced sales lead turned client. 

I happened first one get bonus made huge deal company outing. hundred bucks. Don’t get wrong, it’s nice get extra $$$, huge deal made front everyone, you’d think gotten 5k. embarrassing. think SF bellweather tech-driven companies. many firms Bay area return office spaces campuses? feel physically person necessary collaboration &amp; brain storming? sheer concentration R&amp;D VC SF Silicon Valley proximity networking opportunities. work home &amp; satellite branches end diminishing kind synergism? Getting bed 3 minutes start time incredible.

I'm glad I'm one. start 7, alarm goes 7. reach grab laptop go. fucking nice.

Definitely agree around house stuff too. I've able get much done, well getting dinner done ready time wife gets home. think company wanting go back hybrid (we Covid) I'm pretty firmly going try stay home time really care for/need work social interaction. wonder percentage would actually quit. used drive work, 1.5 hours way matter route - southern California 405 freeway traffic. One day realized spending month life year sitting traffic. told work coming office anymore. era 56k dialup modems. said, okay. really choice. gave driving completely, car got towed away driven months, care (it piece crap anyway). 

That job went business. found new job started taking bus. also took 1 hour way, least could read instead driving. 

Now take job that's longer 15 20 minute commute. worth it. objectively is. Compensation paycheck.

When spend time money getting work compensation package remains unchanged, balance I'm giving vs. I'm getting changes. Oh, good. heard national media source vaccine access yet didn’t expect June. could talking mass vaccine access. someone Doordash, enrages see people say they're taking virus seriously ordering delivery. lot people ordering good jobs good health insurance, making lower risk. lot people deliveries lower-income live large households. Looking covid prevalence map big city, wealthy neighborhoods relatively unscathed, lower-income ones slammed partially due home many ""essential workers"". feel like don’t necessarily grasp reality adult. people know want go back office though. Understandable, live alone pets allowed. Work music shows got socializing done personally can't wait go back something neighbors walking around kitchen light buzzing. Imma lonely boy. interesting I've looking for. Source? EXACTLY. love idiots keep quoting ""99% survival rate"", realizing still means deadliest endemic disease 100 years. Supply Demand. Office jobs pay $$$ everyone wants work home. Seriously. hate it’s basically requirement corporate jobs pretend like give shit people work with/for. whole “this family” thing. can’t fake it. Good workers work remotely productive. workers always top performers office office want work.

Shit workers work remotely even less productive even worse deal with.

The majority career growth also comes inter office communications impromptu discussions ""meetings"". remote workplace replicate this. I’ll switch jobs go back office I’ve made clear.

Our CEO hard time working home nanny cleaning people prefers office come back prepare come back. Oh told come back that’s time, he’s paying bring PC set either come work day you’re told work next day get ready. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* access VAERS website? Canada AZ vaccine basically dead water. approved 65, approved 55, everyone else small range appropriate apprehensive. Even gets approved whole pop again, damage done. Antivaxxers thrive uncertainty skepticism. It'll always here. Probably bad flu everyone's immune systems catch it. Look Russian flu. think it'll 50/50 Dr's following guidelines. team implemented virtual coffee hour week. week, different host. haven’t attended I’ve heard good things. Informing public involve giving invalid information; UK variant new predictions would become dominant variant US around *months*.

Treating like brand new scary variant attempt fearmongering, especially people getting vaccinated. French preference home-grown products though

In terms vaccines seems true countries.  exact situation friend taking calls head hunters he'd blowing previously. website loads right now. worked home almost 20 years.  peachy 2-3 years get social misses ques getting firing.  benefit working home right zoom/teams type software makes talking person close real life. 1 Well weird
- made roughly, say 100k engineer/data-analyst NJ. 
- NYC taxes ""job"" similar engineer/data-analyst job actually **lower** salary NJ, excellent benefits such, maybe 65 70k **barely** covered living expenses, rent/car/commuting. 

- made bank - consulting gig 18 months LLC took 280k 2 years, course that's accounting income taxes taxes additional 80k per year, super great income although first blush sounds cool.


- firm sibling entity/subsidary ""consulted"" incurred income/tax penalties LLC, way consulting tripled salary. work in? Blue collar workers : life still sucks guy replaced said easily 60 hours week job. walk first day, proceeded talk person ran least 10 minutes. 

Six months job basically job 30 hours less people still happy getting support tickets done usually respond ""oh, quick!""

People waste much time work, ridiculous. Moderna. second dose made extreme fatigue flu like symptoms day. Pretty rough happy fully vaccined. Haha read mind. never going back hell hole  wonder age breakdown is. work, itching go back older. younger employees love WFH older guys seem miss office socializing camaraderie hard time working house full kids/SO whatever. Good you! I’m happy hear made move better! similar situation. Switched different place exact job doubled pay! Sars we'd never hear end ""90% survive"" Right like $1 hour $40 week, really work $40 week you?

Like I’ve made 50k sales week.... boat - hiring, pretty detailed posting looking 95% apps it. knew long could screenshot application, they'd get unemployment ""you tried"" credit. anecdotal experience neighbors. Moderna quite bedridden days Pfizer gave discomfort effect. course receiving moderna unaffected too, primarily men. happens less pay abysmal state US internet infrastructure. Yeah here. fear needles (as passing &amp; seizures even get injected needle). Pfizer dose 1 quick felt literally nothing. needle issues, looked away tried distract injection. inspect skin get home make sure guy ""pretend"" inject me.

Pfizer dose 2, actually watched needle go (not good idea someone like me), feel it, barely. Anyone financial wealth management chance work company instituting hybrid full WFH? Could use switch companies Profit cost different things. reinvesting revenue expanding production that's still profit. helps grow vaccine production many poorer countries waiting get doses sooner.

You profit individual product use extra reinvest growth still profit Cough loud heart's content! premature use word post flung around like pandemic over.. literally still here! 

This annoying. think may right. surprise drop mask mandates earlier expected it’s overwhelmingly clear isn’t science support anymore. Idk man, started new job that's mandatory in-office hate it. waste much time money commuting, I'm spending day headphones trying talk anyone anyway. 

For money, received benefits office.  already working home prior pandemic. There's zero chance going back office. sleep want, work want, eat want, get spend time girlfriend friends, never miss anything I'm work early work. Basically job gets planned around life instead planning life around job. information sorta pertinent argument without information OP valid response WFH means could move lower cost living increased amount home space work way. Demanding people come back. Management doesn’t know 15 us 40 person location we’re planning leaving we’re forced back office 100% time. I’m completely comfortable saying vaccines effective immunizer. They’re relegated dosage amount deliver optimal protection, whereas virus swings wildly either minor cold incredibly dangerous. much immediate blowback proposals whole idea largely abandoned. bad allergies always double allergy meds day getting vaccine, sure effective thing, kept severe reactions thus far. also started remotely, last May. I've met direct supervisor person perhaps 5 times, one peers. go office semi-frequently, too, get house, nobody else ever there. Like...3 entire floors massive office building...and I'm one there. yep, know people think rebuttal of, 'they tried foreign workers able high quality work', would hold future. information getting decentralized. people selling tutorials info foreigners would otherwise lots money attend western school for. foreign workers 100x incentive grind, work long hours, study relentlessly, give employer suffer abuse order compete global marketplace, especially jobs already like begin with.

the advantage local people ability easier around likeable cultural advantages. gets erased upper management foreign. year 2065:

r/Coronavirus : COVID STILL HAPPENING! EVERYONE STAY INDOORS! didn’t hold responsible contract. 8 years fix it. Skip middleman contractors go directly J&amp;J NovaVax &amp; Pfizer Moderna. throw bunch money problem it.  take less breaks guilt. stream going something watch big multi tasker even playing games task.   experience people like group projects know get away minimal amount work actual hard workers carry team. feel like checked out... still work, feel like I'mI retaining information, floating through. I'm sure many Ivy League students gonna get vaccine anyway. drive commute takes 35 min fill twice week? mean literally wealthiest companies got insanely wealthy lockdowns regular working families dealing suicides bankruptcy? Thank you! know stable cohorts done Jr High/High School classes change subject. 30-35 students, within 3ft, 3-4 classes per day - that's upwards 100+ ""cohort."" student testing. Definitely hard balance risks, I'm pulling child week half due change. Thanks feedback. looks like cool technology working on. Hopefully don’t end needing next generation vaccines becomes building blocks even better next time dangerous virus emerge.  ones want get back office socialize try get friends rather put burden coworkers. Also seeing “why bother still mask everywhere?” types too.

We still wear masks day office despite everyone 100% vaccinated. Why? State mandate.  still answer natural antibodies good vaccine-produced.

I find odd say ""hard say amount — — immunity recovery offers"" comfortable accepting vaccine-bestowed immunity far superior natural, maybe even innate, immunity. I'd love carry broader survey developed nations. feel like times seem rely much research survey results carried US Americans (at times even proper representation general American views done Ivy league student example), represent common world views. companies start trying force people happily working home full year back office, there’s going massive brain drain companies. work certainly going force us back, want go lengthy process training new person replace person leaves it, that’s loss. Personally think it’d smarter let people want work home full time continue so, micro managers gotta micro manage. pure preference, lets pretend person meetings better default, many would argue opposite. Yes. here. U.K. hospitality company thats apparently looking forward getting back together. 

Erm I’m not. Happy time money spent family actively damaging environment. 100 million people gotten vaccine serious reactions allergic reactions 1 250,000 people, successfully treated.

Remember, lots people suffering long Covid weeks, months, maybe years. disease picnic. leave places like Illinois, openly said they'll never remove mask mandate CDC does? starbucks library open past year door seating pandemic? know WFH age COVID impossible ""switch off"" work end workday. also dont luxury independent space work in, office space bedroom. 

The lines home work became blurred pandemic. sure WFH better blended model opportunity go physical spaces work in. stands still pretty much pandemic. (A pandemic spurred new WFH craze) can't think way information could used track movements, buy, buy it...etc..? 

How would app 1 thing (show vaccine) get used track purchases movements? entire phone would need hacked that, phone already stores unreasonable uncomfortable that.

How would 1 app give government access spending habits? Yeah, home made masks great. help far fully protective. JFC. pay $125/mo Chicago live 9 miles downtown. Ok thanks shouty person. already this. I've worked 3rd party vendors located america, entire dev team abroad. Mods az topics approve mode. New articles allowed unless completely different topic. actual ema report today allowed posted today gossip post yesterday. Meantime, multiple posts things go unchecked Probably extra precaution still. knowledge, there's conclusive evidence can't carry spread virus even vaccinated, still probably place reduce that. Even passengers low-risk getting sick it, possible airline still wants reduce potential spread even passengers n't asymptomatic carriers.

I personally think overkill, especially going way ensure everyone vaccinated flight. point, got roll die return normalcy. Older folks usually. dad can't wait get back full time office. I'm content never go back. hilarious sub \*\*Yankee Doodling intensifies\*\* I’m halfway there. don’t want gain long term disability way. clearly appetite segregating unvaccinated vaccinated

A lot people don't. Giant corporations certain politicians definitely do. tried hit standard deduction lol List colleges requiring covid vaccines Fall 2021, list accurate today:

Rutgers, Brown, Northeastern, Cornell, Fort lewis, Nova Southeastern, St Edwards, Notre Dame. 

2/8 Ivy league schools requiring vaccination huge. round trip commute 74 miles day. IRS standard mileage rate $0.56/mile, that's $41.44 day, $900 month. OP's $500/month works 40 miles round trip, little average.

It's insane much time money I've saved losing commute. even want think much used spend eating breakfast lunch every day top that... Given extra expense effort colleges go last year I'd shocked significant number require vaccination. say would*quit* hybrid schedule would fine me, miss around people. again, feel lot companies realizing office jobs 100% done WFH effectively. No, way EUA vaccine made mandatory anyone, even mention kids Yes, pandemic US end year – unless new variants undermine vaccines, keep we're terms vaccination, distancing, masking, [Covid Support 

But really over, US anywhere, globally. require massive increase vaccine production, well better vaccine administration. global imperative. must fully recover reduce risk variants. Otherwise, Covid continue kill, worse variants may emerge, travel, trade, economics, social stability continue undermined. Could provide specific examples? Mostly business example, leisure quite obvious.

Teambuilding much easier IRL. team of, say, 7 people ... sure, hang zoom call. works. can't talking way could office, restaurant dinner together. 

You also miss general small talk. know, talking coffee machine, casual conversation person next you, etc.

More explicitly work-related, work software engineer, stuff like pair-programming easier place. time sort strange difficult problem faster two three people sit computer check stuff. Screen sharing etc fine good sometimes, moment connection glitches bit get worse resolution, can't read fine text screen. someone wants take keyboard bit. *can* solve issues well, less efficient.

Trying resolve actual *conflicts* online also much harder IRL. Even Zoom still much easier read person room. submission linking reason.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Lucky them. professors know been. reddit, think pay anything crime humanity.  spain? situation here. Extremelybfrustrating ""no choice"" thing. family would also willing even pay vaccine astrazeneca. adoesnt help seeing otger coubtries offering choice ""astrazeneca nothing"" 65s Yup. rich people enemy need begin attacking way they've attacking us decades. keeps trying counter ""what going see class system develop people come office seen committed get recognized promoted often it.""

Yea, nobody gives fuck. People move new company want promotion get money. yet see company offer internally externally. way goes sadly. I'm surprised. job pandemic stay home 6 weeks. boss asked come days week. quickly realized hated working home. 

I got new job always remote.

I get 2 hours sleep, save least 10 hours commuting time. mention gas money maintenance.

The thing I'm surprised 2/3 more. Meanwhile us rotational shift workers get fucked... complain much go work again, us never stopped.  I'll getting mine. there's supply left least lol. that's first stage company already offered hybrid options went full remote pretty much immediately. likely expanding remote options now.  Reading news outdoor transmission low, surface transmission also low, etc., really leaves baffled got last year.

The place went grocery store always wore mask (as everyone else). cheap homemade mask must it? go inside family, spend time anyone did. unlucky lol Murder manager, kiddo owner company work (he’s old boomer) can’t believe people productive working home despite company whole record year sales. soon whined enough management pull us back office sales number began dropping immediately. 

Almost like people home don’t get easily distracted useless meetings older people scared emails, listening Bob talking 40 minutes golf game one remember next day, getting desk get coffee stare wall 20 minutes machine percolates hate stuck grey, soulless cube computer Many people looking bigger places dedicated office spaces. Working kitchen table get old.  close friends thing. think people seeing others vaccinated living less stressful life people getting wise  affect women proportion fact mainly women AZ vaccine. Hence gender specific recommendations. direct reduction employee's compensation

It objectively isn't. compensation same. employer pays amount. take spend something chose spend on.

You live closer drive/ride work. job performed 100% remote, forcing employees back half week issues too. WFH saved money gas, rent, food importantly get hours day back. employee save money like raise costs company nothing, I’m happier, work still gets done. take away? would definitely find another job forced back office job done effectively remote. hilarious people know upvote things saying pay cut. Wfh never changed anything except got sleep, soon 4 hits I'm done logged matter I'm home office Well going make rich people upset. going control workers, now? clear, hate too, reality living in. Governments always prioritized lives people telling truth. mask effectiveness, we're vaccine effectiveness, we'll next time appears people charge save lives. colleges coming requiring Covid vaccines, think good idea? far, Rutgers, Brown, Northeastern, Cornell, Fort lewis, Nova Southeastern, St Edwards, Notre Dame stated require vaccinations fall 2021 semester, many expected also announce it. Personally, think good idea already require vaccines schooling.  someone working office entire time save covid scare spent 2 weeks home huge selling point. people go back, especially forced back, willing people take less money able work home. think see spike infections texas restriction removal actually saw decrease, reaching new low since June. think rest world follow texas removing restrictions? so/no why? non story me. course workers/employees want stay remote, driving factor going employers vice versa.

And hopefully level government get involved bc that’s nonstarter.

Going interesting watch. Weird. felt nothing whatsoever either dose, completely painless/sensationless, everyone I’ve seen similar experience. Nah, I'm gonna say right there. next fall, current vaccine rate, absolutely ""need"" virtual school. still want then, home school. Making taxpayer pay extra option like d**mers absurd. problem lot middle-managers exposed essentially useless companies proved could productive remote working environment. Hey dude problem looking work life balance. expect people pay work.  Pfizer's trial 12-15 year olds shown 100% efficacy, twice measurable immune response even 16-25 group, 0 side definitely legal issue you. onus healthcare workers ensure FDA standards followed. wfh means get pass real estate costs you

That's false. cost passed onto you, cost simply removed. could argue heating electricity passed onto you, energy costs, deductible.

The incentive get bigger housing indicative wealthy employees, suburbian demand indicates freedom, seems opposite claiming. I'm solidly third right now. leadership wants us return exactly way before, starting May 1st. office full-time.

We manufacturing laboratory positions can't done remotely. that, apparently want anyone feeling ""left out"" comes flexible working arrangements. 

My request continue working remotely 1 day per week May 1st rejected. need robust justification so; want conserve time, money, energy, carbon emissions. Probably looking new job management remains stuck ways. people manual labor, logistics, customer service jobs simply can’t home? mean lifting social distancing restrictions? Wait realize multiple work home jobs time. Free money must minority one. can’t wait go back office. miss social interaction terribly. industry in? mean, I'd rather quit return person work too, need paycheck! I'm extrovert hates office life. like weird conversations BBQ, bar, camp trip. small talk office makes hate life much. Nothing worse battling cold, going gray office, someone like, ""Hello, happy Monday!"" thought going back makes want cry. read Reddit threads determine seems like low number thought trains subways cheap???? Wtf much? run city? schedule well, don’t want go back. Social interactions? Fuck that. two kids way entertaining people office. meeting day drags 5pm everyone half-assing cameras off.

Sounds like identified good chunk problem already.

Forcing people sit room one way solve it, others address problem directly less impact.   Might want move place taxes high. get raise keep taxes low. Without children think get herd immunity. June 15th might able get vaccines 12, still lot kids unprotected. single scientist Twitter, put together scientists Cambridge University researching links vaccine CVST. tweeted journalist screenshotted press conference (also held scientists) earlier  building luxury apartments? Prior march 2020 never responsible keeping people healthy. Stay home feel well. That's rule. insanity staying home always ""to protect others"" new terrible concept. commuting waste time money bad environment. 

Office work that, office work. People things home: computers, printers, phones. need office work. Yup. rich people greatest enemy society ever known, they've militarizing domestic wealth protection forces spreading propaganda make weak, stupid conservatives racists hate social justice initiatives. feel like way forward flex-space. Wework type setups multiple companies rent shared space discount used need social people utilize. That's exactly says. correlation. here. think generational thing, older people tend ""grin bear it"" mentality encourages stick things get tough, whereas us younger people afraid say ""fuck this, I'm out."" I'm even 30 I've already worked companies 62 year-old dad (same job since 1982, got grad school).

To own, guess. We're relatively happy situations sides merit. think long minimum wage stayed same. People making excuses businesses cannot operate higher wage minimum don’t seem realize businesses actually giving min wage employees pay cuts years.  

Sorry I’m buying business razors edge f profitability decade paying employees less less money year. Sounds like laziness initially believed basically colleges would require it, weeks ago small liberal arts college stated would requiring students employees. Interesting, isn’t much resistance getting town.

I’m curious see many end requiring it. Lol different strokes guess. don’t drag us back. Let us recluses live peace. 😀 People actually like colleagues . Reddit: Climate change bad need stop it

Also Reddit: Companies shouldn’t stop subsidizing decision drive work alone No, speaks volumes future job market city-dwellers area  outdoor hobby like walking park. Also future able go bars restaurants way easier get socialize way instead able home country interest? figures based recent surveys. Time tell yes vary depending countries general attitude Thanks reply!

Lots female friends got vaccine *all* facing issues periods. young woman healthy menstrual cycle I’m worried this. done protect women effects vaccine? almost like perfectly described erosion American labor market since integration women's rights increased size workers' pool dramatically. meant easily sense able accomplish goals easily remotely vs person, easier remotely. think varies greatly organization make blanket statements better. Hi Dr. Frieden, 


what's exit plan kids? California planning open economy June given vaccination rates hospitalization rates spec. Kids able get vaccinated while. plan hope dropping case numbers? kids infected still lots community transmission among unvaccinated people? would want hybrid schedule? job effectively remotely, desire sit room bunch strangers show good form. could possibly need site for? Conversation? Collaboration? Work? Meeting? produce physical products, need appear person ""team build"". Antiquated mindsets need that, antiquated. Misread said, thought said friends lives season, somehow skipped lifetime part. Lunchbreak gave brain rest recuperate enough read properly lol that's counter with, proves terrible managing people. visually watch someone work know accomplishing, essentially saying micromanager bad job. remote bosses past always saw provided results cases something slipped cracks almost always simple video call figure solution. 

The pandemic exposed crappy managers. restless night J&amp;J, woke headache middle night. I’m glad didn’t get symptoms experienced. publicly mentioned need increased accountable government institutions leaders, including CDC. often seems implication there's problems previous administration temporary problems need get CDC back track.

But failures seem institutional problems; leadership. Especially light testing failures, role think institutional hubris played failing pandemic response? think CDC could done better prepare leadership? year response, think listening elevating platform clinical laboratory scientists high levels might improve response? Would consider perspective future? You’re responding comment OP didn’t make. isn’t saying everyone wearing masks, people sick go reason.

People already bad enough covering coughs properly, you’re sick/coughing morning wear damn mask go out. Doesn’t seem like huge ask. I’m one those, I’m waiting see company’s policy be, allowed remain remote (I’m fine show while), looking new job quit, remote work something recruiters using selling point, even pressure companies update policies.

I’m saving much time commuting, I’m able spend time family, I’m productive I’m able join meetings times would otherwise stuck traffic. It’s true everywhere. looks like cult toxic positivity. Exactly - 5 day workweek ""weekend"" little tough transition into. I'd usually wiped work Friday night, spend Saturday chores, feel ""relaxed"" Sunday 5PM start fretting Monday again. 

With 4x10's get recharge Thursday night, take care chores Friday, relax day Saturday. lovely! ...so, ""spread air"" (airborne transmission), spread water droplets lungs

To clarify, *airborne transmission* droplets doesn’t necessarily mean *aerosolized* transmission. 

[You might conflating *The aggressive nature disease directly connected transport phenomena droplets aerosols, comprehension phenomena vital controlling spread disease within confined spaces.* variants nothing burger far. worth changing behavior vaccinated even recovered. used wake 5am get work time. wake up, make coffee turn computer. I'm never going back office, develop power go gym. banned everywhere CA also benefit warmer weather less population density NY. Easier eat outdoors now.

Michigan also higher prevalence anti-vaxxer side. CA definitely areas, course (we diverse - all).

CA's sheer population size makes easier virus spread since highly contagious. also one lower hospital capacities relative population size. CA variant top flew quarter 4 2020.

People CA (or visitors) good job (people stopped giving fuck) saw cases rise due that. think LAX record travel one holidays recall correctly. Either way lot people listening experts. I'm sure control people give shit think careful enough/COVID affect them.

Vaccines big part helping stabilize things. thing, deaths dropped especially able focus elder care facilities start getting risk vaccinated. course also immunities people got sick short also. 

It's lot everything, CA's plan also part coupled CA setup. Unless actual, certified medical product (N95+) mask wore protected others breath, theirs. jealous texas. Fuck massachusetts. one explanation it, whole thread pretty good explanation this. $50 gas? Jheezus. UK that’ll get half tank small car. sad life. Can't imagine wanting go socialize coworkers. want friends people work with. people already said people change jobs see raise. plugged numbers made started first full time job would making still would barely beating inflation. I’ve worked really hard good luck I’m better financially wouldn’t happened didn’t change jobs. thoughts covid passports international sense considering state vaccine equity geopolitical climate? feel like might open abuse seen unconvincing decisions regard (e.g. Lithuania Sputnik V China western vaccines)? like NYC could handle extra couple million people living either. point either entire city blocks need razed ground high density housing need good public transportation.

The dynamic cities' development get centralized. It'd great every town could every industry, can't. get megalopolises vast majority want live in. Ehh depends. Housing usually outweighs transportation expenses Post-pandemic, maybe socialize *after* work. Wish could WFH, avoid BS coworkers, catch pint people Like afterward. Production mRNA requires DNA, haven’t seen anything suggesting Marburg produce DNA. 

BNT consistently clear Marburg produce mRNA combine LNP Marburg plant, course. 

(We also know Marburg isn’t producing lipids; seem sourced Alabama, although that’s 100% clear. BNT may mentioned DNA plasmids (or lipid manufacturing) considers like raw materials.) I'm sorry believe taxing rich bad poor. ran amok Kent. Lately it’s overheard Mayfair."
