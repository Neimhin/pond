The Swedish Public Health Agency taken position circumstances use oral protection even outside care nursing would value.

The position based scientific data SARS-CoV-2 spread, information infection control units' infection tracking work infection spread studies different types oral protection effect laboratory environment society.

## spread infection?

Covid-19 spread primarily drip contact infection. Viruses spread close direct indirect contact humans via droplets air. combination environment, time activity affects spread infection.

There greater risk infection spreading indoors outdoors, greater risk small cramped spaces without good ventilation compared large, well-ventilated spaces. periods colder drier climates, winter, viruses spread easily summer. Prolonged close contact people increases risk transmission transmitted. Coughing sneezing infected person greatly increases risk droplets spreading others, compared with, example, ordinary exhaled air.

Experiences regional infection control units work infection tracing show infection Sweden mainly takes place home, work social contexts dinners parties. Scientific reports countries show thing. environments situations completely avoided many cases.

## Situations masks reduce risk infection

The Swedish Public Health Agency recommend general use masks society. Overall, scientific support use oral protection society curb spread covid-19 weak. contrast measures, keeping distance always staying home slightest symptom.

However, situations mouth protection despite weak evidence value. Properly used, quality-assured disposable masks reduce risk carriers environment situations close contact, extended period time, indoor environment unavoidable.

Such situations primarily arise workplaces performing work steps shown. identified, managers, self-employed persons employers employees jointly. Routines use masks developed based assessed needs. also good opportunities instruction wear handle masks.

In public transport, congestion, close contact long time, sometimes occur, despite measures taken. far, however, neither information regional infection control units experiences countries indicate public transport environment infection spread greater extent. usually short trips made, trips possible keep distance help booked places. However, difficulties infection tracing public transport infections environment occur without detected also risk occasional infections create new chains infection.

Apparently represents nursing home got “extra” doses vaccinated family. Taiwan, example, did. Texas outbreak based political bigotry, New York CA? Wasn’t obese either. It’s scary. goes show virus take anyone. roll dice? Continue staying home much possible, wear mask go out. It’s worth risk, matter low risk might seem. Small gatherings responsible 70 percent infections New York last month holidays. hard believe similar situation California. type Facebook full random people. friends. Thats community. know announced diagnosed. Yes, individual measures still effective.

However, variant replicates easier might nearly impossible contain without strong coherent collective action. arguable something Americans good last time. political decision, no. scientific evidence. one think producing vials injectors last year?  people making policies people live consequences them. Fuck cannot wait til voting time comes. idiots might win jobs back certainly try prevent happening.

If muh colours reason problems, California badly now? Why? 
This suggestion always confused me. 
There little intrinsic value gold. 
In true collapse, currency vital sustaining human life would quite quickly plummet value. 
Sure gold real uses (technology products one), average joe, would nothing starving death. 
Food, water, supplies increase / maintain supplies would vital. good thing including responsibility state provide masks worry disposal, absent mask plans.

I feel really scammed paying 10 euro pack 19 flimsy masks Yeah...so die instead... thinking allow officers body cameras taze anti-maskers.It would glorious 1) training officers wear body cameras. 2) wiping anti maskers. 3) video sell watching anti-maskers get tazed!

**From 7 January 2021, mouth protection recommended public transport 7-9 16–18 weekdays, throughout country.**

The Swedish Public Health Agency [decided new general addressed public Sweden. People travel public transport, possible keep distance booking place, recommended wear masks times weekdays many people usually travel: 7-9 4-6 pm weekdays.

The advice aimed people born 2004 earlier, ie people upper secondary school age older.

\- effective keep distance close others masks. know public transport means situations congestion difficult avoid despite recommendation choose means transport first place. mouth protection useful, says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.

In first place, everyone's responsibility bring mask, preferably good quality, ie CE-marked. Swedish Public Health Agency [recommends companies operate public provide oral protection travelers opportunity bring own. Companies also encouraged inform travelers masks worn. also advised plan waste disposed of.

The new General Council covers whole country, although problems congestion public transport often greatest big cities.

I'm bit like WTF.

If could true, kind defeat purpose vaccine? eradicate virus, would allow us lift quarantines lockdowns, would benefit businesses economy. Yes would stop people dying – that's already win – virus would continue spreading, vast majority people, bad symptoms anyway, would benefit vaccine feeling better, would still spreading it. vaccinate risk death serious illness, then? Bacterial endocarditis (which brother had) peri-/myocarditis. Usually mutations become contagious less dangerous. 

That necessarily case. virus could enter cells easily replicate faster within them, could cause quicker spread (which seem observe) severe illness (a single infected cell would make ill).

The argument usually virus kills host spread worse replicating. Say variant rabies would kill within one day usually transmits second day - would able replicate.

But, well-known viruses kill almost certainly without treatment, much later spreading, example HIV. Sars-Cov-2 belongs clearly category, infects people frequently victim symptoms, kills usually three weeks more. So, could even mutate kill much much higher rate, without transmission much affected.

You also blame state governments possibly allocating correctly firm plan place distribution—but again, decisions made state level.

Herd immunity required relaxation restrictions, eradication goal return normalcy. saying trials unreliable whatever: I'LL HAPPILY TAKE DOSE! get vaccine, leave bigger supply want it. Thank condolences. understand people refuse wear masks, still think pandemic 'not big deal' 'just like flu.' real people dying whole society impacted selfishly carry on. know moot point 9 months shame get heated discussion someone - what's going change mind now? feel vindictive.

I'm sorry circumstances receive surgeries (multiple pandemic, yikes) I'm glad received hope well path recovery remission now. Stay safe, friend. Also police forced retract charges punished. factually correct original SARS virus, entirely new one. original SARS much higher mortality rate asymptomatic transmission, fucked us time around making us underestimate quickly COVID would spread. I've seen evidence people vaccinated spread virus. tweet saw eloquently said, I'd let shove entire iPad ass ended pandemic. Saying ""there evidence vaccines reduce transmission risk"" pretty much _exactly_ like saying ""there proof develop immunity virus"" several months ago: flies face simple scientific logic ignoring fact evidence literally cannot exist yet.

(and qualifying fyi, reduce =/= eliminate) China (though relatively remote province). freaked fuck out. flew back US soon possible (quarantined 2 weeks course, never symptoms). Ironically probably would safer China. 

That whole trip bizarre experience. surreal flying China, took temperature like 20 times, US basically checks all. could gotten plane gone Disneyland.

Also, China definitely cases confirmed total, there’s basically way they’d able hide real outbreak. believe control. damage something made up? Hanlon attribute malice adequately explained stupidity ""go live normal lives"" hope clearly done that... efficacy based following social distancing? case may far less effective go back party mode, right? also gave try 2013. like you, got bored repetitive started ranting politics time. fear many favorite comedians/podcasters going end like this. fan Andrew Schultz while. Ever since Pandemic started, focusing politics/conspiracy theories - really disappointing. feel western countries detain people spreading false information? happens government detains someone spreading false information later investigations reveal info actually correct? people harmed government get apology? Restitution? wife essential whole year. far poor, every essential worker isn’t poor. 

Also, said means saving cash next emergency. Case numbers matter all. soon deaths come way hospitals empty out, restrictions relaxed. Burnt Christlips? know symptoms listed? That's overwhelming majority experiences covid, including me.

I exact symptoms listed less 24 hours. You’re believing Tory Minister said UK’s regulatory body best, UK’s one best... even said Brexit reason could approve vaccine quicker could thay, friend pericarditis sent doctor thrt didn’t anything recovered. comes leaning forward stuff, don’t see difference. pain comes goes throughout day, day pain sometimes bothers awhile disappear. strange don’t think us anything gain, I’d curious many politicians skin game stocks you.... naysayers matter. 

I’m part US trial vaccine, say this. haven’t developed antibodies thus far. Based side effect profile feel inclined believe received actual vaccine. received second dose week ago, may drawn soon. We’ll see happens another couple weeks. get health care workers vaccinated probably bring unlicensed temporary workers like volunteer/students perhaps troops/national guard equivalent that's still going better massive intervals time anybody able check them, that's really case. 

Without vaccines bit questionable anyone without training anywhere near someone Covid, healthcare workers vaccinated could vaccinate temporary workers think would safe enough still lot better catastrophically understaffed since numbers likely continue overwhelming hospitals another month several rollout keeps going slow. “not going happen them” undeveloped frontal cortex. 

Also connection spreading Covid don’t even think you
have Covid really abstract concept people let alone dumb teenagers. 

Also, asking generation basically give youth save generation (boomers) don’t give shit anyway literally done everything make sure permanently struggling. Im really surprised maybe boomers reaped sow little here. (I’m gen x record) Well every box single mask I've purchased instructions put mask. custom masks interchangeable made keep particles caught mask. real mask issues lot people see government official make one shirt bandana think cloth ok.

California's cases actually declining since mid Dec. see graph middle page great hospital bed population ratio, last counted 1.8 per 1000 residents.

Just sit right back hear tale

A tale fateful trip

That started tropic port

Aboard tiny ship

The mate mighty sailing man

The skipper brave sure

Five passengers set sail day

For three hour tour, three hour tour

The weather started getting rough

The tiny ship tossed

If courage fearless crew

The minnow would lost, minnow would lost

The ship set ground shore

Of uncharted desert isle

With Gilligan, skipper too

The millionaire wife, movie star

Professor Mary Ann's

Here Gilligan's isle

So tale castaways

They're long, long time

They'll make best things

It's uphill climb

The first mate skipper too

Will best

To make others comfortable

In tropic island nest

No phones, lights, motor cars

Not single luxury

Like Robinson Crusoe

It's primitive be

So join us week friend

You're sure get smile

From seven stranded castaways

Here Gilligan's isle

Yeah Gilligan, skipper too

The millionaire wife

The movie star

Professor Mary Ann's

So math. 4M shots per day immunizes 2M/day, 60M month (with J&amp;J gets even easier). gets us done June.

4000000 divided 70000 sites. Thats 57 shots per day per site (of course more). info far says 5 Pfizer per hour. Moderna faster, AZ faster still. means need roughly 12 man hours per site per day. That's roughly 2 people per site (140k total) mostly focused shots next 5 months. 

Considering need RNs this, think that's setup possible. think people this. Right bottleneck beaurocracy - phase 1a/1b/etc.

But here's thing - youre 4M shots day, start rate pretty soon - already time product longer bottleneck. already 26M shots produced arms. least another 50M Jan, perhaps 100M Feb. give 120M/month max. means inauguration day sites set up, start humming get done. don't, bottleneck may state level beaurocracy.

Secondly, every single case opportunity virus mutate something isn’t covered vaccine. People vaccinated catch virus anyway especially risk creating strain escape immune response vaccine generates.

OMG food. might unpopular, hope WFH becomes permanent accepted pandemic dies ends.\

Such bold take Reddit. wish brave. There's another good older book (70s 80s, think) subject Philip Ziegler, memory serves. wrote report 1st-year World History class, even 30+ years later, remember vivid nightmares gave me. That's definitely feel approach given they're handling approval, rollout, messaging. 

The US trying methodical this. UK taking gamble feels like political reasons. 

Given data, blame them. Worse case gamble work they're worse (health wise, it'd big waste money/resources though). practically upside insignificant downside. ""Well vaccine 95% effective (at best), could still potentially spread someone could potentially die!""

(I think that's ridiculous argument, apparently people anything 0% risk.) piece says:

“We know vaccine clinical trials it’s going take 10 14 days start develop protection vaccine,” Ramers said.

“That first dose think gives somewhere around 50%, need second dose get 95%,” 

The article doesn’t mention nurse second dose getting sick. Even it, completely immune front-line workers presumably exposed higher viral load risks. nice wait March vaccine Thanks info, cheers would thought dictatorial regime would lie number cases...
 🤔 🤔 🤔 follow recommendations letter.  Whats evidence contrary?  “...epidemic control Wuhan main battlefield successful effectively prevented large-scale spread epidemic”

The rest world might like disagree Care rationed, goes beyond simple 'normal' rationing says ”foreigners” right title. numbers frustratingly slow right now. we're 3 weeks vaccination program. Anthony Fauci, Bill Gates, Moncef Slaoui agree going see frustratingly low numbers doses/jabs given first, go (which been.)

We recently gave vaccine 900,000 Americans 2 days. previous 2 days, gave 500,000 people. tRump. We're getting competent person office 21 days. hard guys say is. Strong competition also good substitute minimum care regulation. problem US neither. that's insanity! doctor insisted get MRI showed degenerative disc disease back. bother time unless start picking lot boxes. awful! option surgery. So, big surgery $10 worth pills year? getting downvoted? Wear mask bro. unlikely. AZ even formally applied approval yet, process can't begin. Didn’t read article specifically...

But guy lives rural county (middle nowhere) recent travel history... Denver one international flight Europe right (where variant present), don’t direct flights uk.

meaning caught someone local, likely also contracted within state. Though agree you, think there's lot people still think responsible, actually aren't. 

Here country, people allowed meet holidays one household. naturally, met three different households three different days.

They following rules, thinking responsible. surprising easily top front page. Given low cost easy logistics, one probably end whole mess global scale. decisive moment. trouble core freedom modern democracies freedom citizens leave country whenever wish, allowed re-entry whenever return. ""slippery-slope"" argument overused cases, here, really long-term risk ban could used precedent future government, reasons might benign *our* government.

Personally, want ban people leaving, I'd approve people clearly warned *not* evacuated back Canada get ill Covid, domestic universal healthcare plans *not* reimburse Florida hospitals treatment. corpse, though, would get subsidized repatriation flight. Eventually. Meanwhile, Israel preparing 4 elections 2 years crazy unstable government.

It's president, system. Oh Yeah
very interesting experience got vaccine rubella mumps measles one two shots went UC Los Angeles Yes, need much better public transportation. Even outside better environment, it’s important people low income areas. definitely hope green new deal taken seriously new administration can’t settle anything less point 41 years old. shit scary India rest low income countries. India would get 35m 50m, plan expand capacity 100m/month. fucked units syringes house, therefore could ever give someone IM shot .3ml (I think that's he's saying) here!  
\-Those visuals along rapid construction hospital add-ons got attention like nothing else \*long\* time. telling people around serious things could get virus went global, met chuckles eye -rolls.  Moderna supply arrives Spring apparently forget, Oxford jab older Vaccine Technology know plenty safety. delays stem dosing regimen confusion maximise immunity. isn't, opinion, valid reason delay getting vaccine circulation start saving lives! really reason calm much. Thanks exponential growth increase transmission rate huge chance fuck health systems dramatically.  cause *proportionally* deaths. mortality rate same, infectiousness higher. Gotta love throwing vaccine arm find covid!!!!!! greatest news far year. vaccine vaccine potentially get world mess. Yes 100% effective preventing cases, seems highly effective preventing hospitalizations - massive impact health care systems, eventually also prevent death. Yes, mRNA vaccines seems effective, get mess let’s say summer, open society perhaps get mRNA vaccine get available general populations. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

This strain seem make sick much often. disagree one those. also exactly line link posted. think I'm misunderstood here.  
The science right says exactly one persons quoted first article says  **It’s likely** face masks, blocking even virus-carrying droplets inhale, reduce risk falling seriously ill COVID-19, according [Monica MD, infectious disease specialist UC San Francisco. 

(emphasis mine).  


""It's likely that"". think wrong say scientific conclusion topic. evidence enough mandate masks many public situations (shopping, public transport, ...). 

The science still much weaker protection-of-the-wearer though, protection-of-others. nothing, still much weaker. didnt write 6 days wanted seem like one day.

Youve dont multiple times reported numbers Sweden dont understand trying deny it. Vit MK2 easily solves dilemma. Davie504? It’s shame embarrassment celebrities self serving politicians getting vaccine people  know serious side effects we're learning about? ones give life long conditions. Yeah those.

So think this. Without socialized Healthcare many die long period time need expensive care virus. many cases healthy people. ACA issues solid step right direction. COVID19 force America socialized Healthcare, kicking screaming pure American anti-science fashion.

I'd make argument people see correlation base problem. non-native English speaker, really enjoyed term ""more popular diseases"", thank you! RIP TLTR: nurse got one shot instead 2 (one brings immunity 50% second raises 95%) takes around 10 14 days order body develops immunity First cases local transmission Victoria recorded, reportedly linked outbreak Sydney, ending Melbourne's 61 day streak community transmission. biggest scam earth, never believe word say countries like US public transit non-existent, cars necessity live. thats also green new deal talked public transit investments.

Cars necessity, be. staff work multiple locations staggeringly irresponsible who's ready 2020 2: electric boogaloo? Indian committee meeting likely we'll get first vaccine approved today itself. supposed 95% effective seeing one clinical trial (from find), I'm surprised real-world results vary one study's results. object mask wearing object claims know masks scientifically (I know heavily politicized countries strange hell, zero feelings one way other). 

It's one thing say wear mandate masks based know \*yet\* (I agree that). entirely different thing claim know certainty well masks work. think massive confusion around this, exactly reason politicized. People want overstate understate benefits. 

Many people sub seem think somehow even suggesting science low certainty still, ""anti mask"" - home countries people make claims weak science \*because\* anti-mask. understand one level people get upset even discussing scientific status quo, time, draw conclusion every argument made ""for"" ""against"" masks. blame US politics large extent dumbing this... People seem forgetting covid vaccine seasonal i.e. need (at least) vaccinated year like flu vaccine. shortage vaccine going end, free vaccination last, covid waves going end. lifetime.

Bruh. Hell yammering about? Because, know, rip cannulas, like said. Also, violent coughing fits nice time awake, even last hours. Way better go propofol bliss.

Ecmo patients awake starting improve, still bad shape. heart surgeon, hell know, sometimes get ICU doctors hell thinking. 

Also, one last note, cannulas probably placed surgeon, likely ICU doctor cardiologist. surgeon secures cannulas, dance cha-cha-cha want, comming accidentally. Fixation points probably loose, worse, any, stickers clinicians use fixate them, I've seen happen, never surgeon places them, bad there's always surgeon present place them. going get infinitely harder it’s general public local drugstore.

You get vaccinations pharmacy US? special occasion? There's huge ad January issue Toronto Life ... issue pretty much dedicated incredibly serious pandemic, including interviews several 'long-haul' sufferers imploring people take seriously they've ever taken anything lives ... inviting winter-weary Canadians come Florida Keys spend tourist bucks!

I begrudge magazine taking money idiot DeSantis tourism lobbyists suck off, sincerely hope A) many Torontonians dumb enough take crazy trip Cape Covid, B) ones go require hospitalization expect province Ontario airlift save medical bankruptcy. need 230,000,000 Americans get vaccine.

you cannot . none.

So named literally loads mRNA vaccines. answering question? whole point thought mRNA vaccines might unknown long term effect, pointed human trial 2009. 

Are trying move goalposts got really muddled?! feeling OK? antimask area?

Around works Bluetooth.
And need close proxyminity like &lt; 2 least 15 min.

Unfortunatly &lt; 10 % infected enter code.
One reason state really slow never delivered codes first place. hope got goes think it’s get administered pharmacist every year past decade I’ve never reacted. Necessity mother invention. Think long could atom bomb invented WWII. Absolutely. glued internet last week moment. Ideally, Indian approval happen today tomorrow since lot time analyse data. 

With mock vaccination drills going on, believe Jan 4 also possible date we'll see first Indian get vaccinated.

And 8-12 weeks gap 2nd dose, see 20 million vaccinations Jan end, pretty easy - tell people can't it. get rowdy tell they'll jump bunch hoops. stay rowdy tell get line. 

Make sure give sucker after. podcast NPR vitamin covid talked test homeless found 40% homeless people it, asymptomatic.

They think got vitamin people, could also well homeless people's immune systems top notch nasty stuff they're exposed to. think argument going zero one doses gives biggest gain immunity going one two, give many people one possible biggest gain society. pull cars over. Sounds better going in. refurbished buildings etc?

Hospital ships arrived little use coast (and poor covid protocols) left cuz numbers never made there.

Wonder what's reasoning behind calling again.

Now we're beds looking terrible even surge begin. Talk piss poor planning. No. written article yesterday. Talking doctors seeing severity illness younger patients mortality. That's making stands out.

That's death rate sees highest numbers. hospitals overwhelmed, people pneumonia low oxygen levels get sent home, instead admitted, lot people die. what? 70% deaths due COVID men 30% women I'll specific. enough time analyze long term immunity current coronavirus vaccines. Data would need make accurate predictions.  I'd interested seeing hardware need place mass scale up. Always impressive seeing things move small scale lab bench level industry bioreactor levels whats nuke? point pointing difference US France. point countering 'France traditionally hesitant vaccination' countering. can't believe see this. nationalisitic one here. 

Why trying score geo-political points vaccine development?

I refuted argument comment comment chain, fuck off. curiosity, anyone found papers SARS-CoV-2 actually infecting cells heart? I've read inflammation primary cause damage, I've also read heart abundant ACE2. Yeah, bet scientists public would preferred developed slowly instead getting mess. better prepared next Pandemic nevertheless. getting 30 from? &amp; applying 70%? apply 70% gen pop, 70% male pop, 70% female pop see differences ratios thing happened me, although HPV. get bunch vaccines traveling, told Dr felt light headed told ""take easy"" stay anything. Dropped waiting room. Don’t rule place already usual vaccines? Haha ""Maybe Brexit bad UK thought."" AZ apparently hasn’t filed admission much EMA do. decent rationale waiting next set results/trials. first odd partially botched.  takes month immunity? Thats unfortunate remain centre 15 minutes following vaccination ensure and/or child within easy access medical care unlikely event severe rare reaction usually occurs within first 15 minutes following vaccination. God stop. wrong, obvious wrong. cherry picked sources even agree conclusion making actually fucking read them.

The UK regulator, one Oxford listening to, care dosing mistake. told time happy explination.

The condition mentioned immediately determined vaccine related. think trials going ahead every country. read Lancet paper moron - Oxford one actually publish peer review trials far.

I give shit US EU regulators need information. good them, care, think do. fuck off, happy UK approved it. doom monger helping anyone. making weird claim UK hypernationalisitic place approving evil vaccine becuase pride fucking nonsense - get bubble. great still refuse answer question.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Around like 25-30 % family, &lt; 10 % percent work low single digit reasons.. 
And around 60 % unknown. so... basically said? USPS seems fine delivering 50 ad papers week. Sure - could withhold doses 12 weeks ""shift giving many people possible first dose"" guarantee everyone 2nd dose available

In situation manufacturing delivery issues people may wait longer 12 weeks 2nd dose want mine place money donated non-profits go, executives. Same. Half staff nursing facility refused it. I'm shocked many people even entertain notion. yet many people understand reason economy shamble (at least little man) US handled virus, virus itself. Yeah lot organizations/people, that’s argument church prevents 100% hospitalizations. Go it. don’t stick head sand pretend AZ conducted proper phase 3 trial bailed MHRA multiple occasions nearly every western regulatory agency signaled would deny approval becuse phase 3 trials numerous obvious failings.

Vaccine hesitancy isn’t solved rushing approvals splicing data meet standards set competent biopharmaceutical companies US Germany.  family member pastor.

According them, spiritual social aspects in-person church important public health.  Willing bet hundred rich people politicians  True, enough vaccines ordered like countries though companies like Pfizer asked though, instead passing offer. Pfizer vaccine also co-developed BioNTech I'd say tied first Germany, anything. referring Covid though rather *all* vaccines get point.

I could care less develops vaccine first long effective safe, want damn vaccine period wait summer people age group first world countries get way do. over, visiting Florida. won’t even buy Florida Orange juice I’m disgusted people elected run state. confirm. lot nurses jumping ship work travel agencies. Right now. work hospital next town 5x salary. curious memory retention. mRNA Cell production still protein years after? long Covid mutate drastically, need get one every year? yeah, that’s order magnitude worse seasonal flu - top that, virus spreads much easily population prior inmunity. 

numbers like sound reassuring talking points people can’t (or don’t want to) understand mean context. fatality rate 1-2% good argument throwing caution wind letting virus run rampant - US alone would millions dead that. Beautiful. India approve day two, we'll mass vaccination campaigns extremely reduce severity. Hopefully things better right next two months. still required. vaccines lessen transmission, per manufacturers experts like Fauci. 

The New Normal group vulnerable contains lot 10% population, especially western countries. aren’t enough go around. Unlikely you’ll able pick choose exactly one you’ll get. Every day blursday. Herd immunity pipe dream anyways. Fauci said 90% people need vaccinated get herd immunity. infectious strain found leaked UK 70% infectious. easily looking +95% vaccination rate general population herd immunity infectious strain.  vaccine works 95% people. even include people medically unable get vaccine. never able go back normal. going masks rest lives risk killing hundreds thousands.  point Astra Zeneca mismanaged trial got approved EUA agency brought finish line despite knocking hurdles. 

MHRA approved vaccine demographic never tested dosing regimen EU US regulators signaled would deny applied current data set. MHRA wants give vaccine EUA without complete data set that’s county’s business AZ vaccines won’t reach American shores actually conduct phase 3 trial without making amateur mistakes submitting half tested vaccines approval. 

What’s counter productive ending vaccine hesitancy rushing approval processes make poor planning governments part meet vaccine needs UK. hate break you, that's literally wtfuji saying... UK leading charge here. Going watch Mr. Bean right properly honor became effectively equivalent heat sink friends medicine, shit deal seeing scares living crap them. go like every day point listening vent anxiety utter horror show occuring. I've lucky contact outside world since really start incredibly limited, keep going probably another couple months, human contact others helping keeping wildlife rehab running volunteer work. seriously guarding zoological transmissions, disease vectors popping spreading across US, mention human animal transmission covid. Without volunteer help centers like stop functioning another line defence falls disease vector tracking. none would happened people actually followed rules. US still entire states without mask mandates, literally peoples' fault economy screwed. reading hear congress laugh leave us rot. Spoiler: gross mismanagement part hospitals. proper risk management since given info need. told many doses coming when, hold less reserve.

But told vital information. cannot guess this.

So holding need hold reserve fully vaccinate many people can, requires 50% held. without second dose, guarantee viability.

And supply dry up, sudden got vaccine going waste people time window get 2nd dose. working fully healthy informed supply chain, would different story, fucking chaos hospitals cannot know told. wonder German politicians think January millions British vaccinated still won’t access AZ. Yeah added, I'm US. works here... 

Also, risk means: risk developing _severe complications_ flu. case aforementioned groups. saying others get flu vaccine apparently health officials country feel way? different mindset compared US, sure. might unpopular, hope WFH becomes permanent accepted pandemic dies ends. Honestly ""new normal"" thing - rest, mostly regarding socialization old normal hopeful for. yes, I'm hoping WFH. 

I'd rather stay home work, avoid commute. again, one sociable coworkers (not anti-social extremely introverted, rather extensive social life friends already need it), one relies coworkers socializing. Bruh wtf We've vaccines humans time, least years. think happened many times before. talking serial killers. even discerning that. Yes. good data (still need course) says reduces time symptomatic amount virus spread  159 deaths NYS today 285 PA. gravitating back early days. still even close suffering. go hiking n stuff, wear mask. go clubbing. nba using masks, know rules coaches bench players generally wear them. well, don't. im lakers fan saw lebron n95 chin diaper like, dude, come on

and yes know they're tested hell play games train together, mean, got n95 whats point wearing chin, get cloth mask keep wanna set example people. Usually flowers, cards, soft toys, phone/calling cards, weird balloons sticks never deflate. sore throat 4-5 days now, enough alone count ""COVID symptoms""? even much unattractive, subpar. Like me, I'm black. ton dating prospects might closed due racism. others LGBT, depending lot members community, things matter, money I’ve given one year, I’m giving another. either go back normal kill myself. Life short shit. don’t really care think. People die every day something. Enjoy life locked house. state Texas [reported record 26,990 new cases likely clearing holiday testing backlog. Hospitalizations rose record 11,775 COVID-19 inpatients. Currently 25% used hospital beds 41% used ICU beds occupied COVID-19 patients. Remember ""new normal,"" eternal inconvenience structuring life around virus misnomer. going like transition period vigilantly checking vaccination status, distancing, masking actual normality resume, longer overriding concern. Like article says, freedom coming flooding back, rather slow exhalation, light grow brighter every day. I'm happy her! Imagine worry virus anymore. instead, screw you. You’re political sycophant. Probably democrat, equivalent you’re American. 

Even politicians declining shot need get it. So, fuck off. don’t either. test positive Minnesota you’re Wisconsin doesn’t count here. People realise Lot people wear masks still protected Virus also enters airwaves lungs Eyes like famous Chinese Doctor Wuhan died mid 40’s Doctor Li said careful wear mask said didn’t realise eyes another entry point Maybe average redditor. normal society actually enjoys leaving house every then. situation France anything like Germany, number high people understand know vaccines safe, even short time development. many people took sceptics know someone person took it, rate go up. end ratio vaccination important mandated vaccines. big problem Germany, assume France different, big campaign explains it. broadcast radio regular basis, pinned explanation top webpages newspapers, posters bus stops post office.

Just little shit campaign explains nothing gets lost void nothingness.

In eyes, massive fail politicians.

In end matter. enough vaccine doses anyways. now, deniers make way someone else. finally enough doses everyone, majority probably changed mind.

However, opinion. Take want. think people need organized large space also need distancing. 1 person every 7.5 minutes isn’t happening unless use school gyms locations. 

It takes long check appointments, check temperature, check medical records, line shot. give shot. people wait 15-30 minutes. Plus staff equipment allergic reactions.

Edit: plus maintaining distancing entire time TBF, Surface awesome device US military medical ship still docked LA? still taking non-infected patients? Well damn thing open high numbers people haven’t able work months. Haha thinking thing.... % better getting virus? corona 5% fatality rate across age groups would already catastrophic apocalypse.

This would point low paid jobs likely would refuse go work factory, grocery store even drive truck. would get control situation pretty quickly people would actually starve anarchy would reign.

We lucky case people downplay better economy stop working happens can't tell people go home quarantine. People would places spreading virus rapidly problems staying home day. 

Scary think this... Yea. lot places saying 2021. still using available stock 1A. Although Hermann Hospital group giving public, it’s difficult get appointment.  Uh no. queen 94. death causes chaos UK, stupid. Aurora Medical center throw 50 vials 500 doses fucked up. Smh Agreed, especially states aren’t locked better are. probably start back mid late 2021 336k deaths 19.4million cases equals 1.7% also know sports entertainment company made segment face (good) diva sneezed face heel (bad) diva harassing her. actually enforce them. can't civilly, use military lock down. long? rest lives? Fuck negative sub I've ever seen....I make mistake reading every often always regret still blown away let people die cos can't give another year life. still reported 6 days. Daily new cases reported USA easily exceed 200k, 7-day running average reported deaths 1.5k per day. report 6 days past, would worse swedish report metrics. really making point see. Perhaps, indeed known much money spends healthcare. country planet. 

One would expect reasonable outcome given amount resources devoted here! Yes us enjoy life outside houses. long expect people this? Fingers crossed San Andreas go winter... know there's level pre-planning would matter mass casualty natural disaster added top pandemic filled hospitals. Yeah, it’s kinda crazy treat people caution vaccine people freaking vaccines around tested years. It’s all. 

I’ve watched us democrat party go party trusted brainwashed “follow science” group. They’re much different religious conservatives grew with. Turns people similar. Yep I'm - there's good new data (from US trial otherwise), deffo I'd take it! things atm, data convincing enough IMO, I'd rather avoid it. US EU fast-tracking must good reasons why. ""Barely felt it"" .. kind nonesense that? talking needle vaccine would different.

I hope DEMs succeed need talk people like adults. faith Kamala though Umm nope it’s either go back life go back shoot myself. think hospital reported vaccinations you’ve done idea? Yeah one follow rules inflammatory response causing neurological symptoms. thought big deal catch covid ""not deadly"", enjoying lowered cognitive capacity, memory loss. sure, whereas I’m prepared rule anything stage I, like you, determine probable scenario information available. Maybe I’m dumb...but enough people get vaccine cases begin going down, doesn’t effect transmission? corona 5% fatality rate across age grouos would already catastrophic apocalypse.

This would point we're low paid jobs would refuse go work factory, grocery store even drive truck. would get control situation pretty quickly people would actually starve anarchy would reign.

We lucky case people downplay better economy stop working happens can't tell people go home quarantine. People would places spreading virus rapidly problems staying home day. We’ve sacrificed lives year. plan almost half next year well. average human sacrifice lives sub 0.01 population. That’s percentage similar average risk took going outside COVID. again, managing expectations. study, however, added “secondary attack rate”, proportion contacts confirmed cases develop disease themselves, higher people infected new variant. Earlier Tuesday leading epidemiologist advises government, Andrew Hayward, warned Britain heading “catastrophe” coming weeks take tougher action infectious variant disease. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson approved placing parts country highest level restrictions, known tier 4, Times reported. Exactly. That’s I’m trying see it. Young old, anyone gets vaccinated one less vector disease world. sure tossing virgins volcanoes work stop covid? Cuomo needs new schtick. talking trump bud? believe science. Go look cdc say comorbidities. Oxford-AstraZeneca expected approved UK rolled next days. Maybe that's thinking of? Isn’t movie Outbreak? eonder thst came from! Far low? ridiculously low. UK hundreds thousands samples.... Wait, hospitals gift shops? Wtf?  hospital gift shop sell?  Dunlevy idiot half Anchorage. miss living I'm proud third generation Alaskan, people embarrassment. Well, reality is, that's assumption without proof. Making assumptions often gets way finding truth. know, we'll know everything table. ones back already smell? What's (more dangerous) characteristic strain? Here's popcorn🍿🍿🍿  Total *reported*. One expect actual numbers much higher real numbers comes coming days weeks (ref. critics saying would never coronavirus vaccine, period. multiple effective vaccines already given Americans. still long way go we’re solid start finally getting thing control. interest, would refuse it?

Even effectiveness uncertain, safety data still sound. Safety would deal-breaker me. 

The lower effectiveness means higher percentage need herd immunity, offset greater vaccination rate sure doses available earlier. Either way, getting means part herd immunity. 1.8% say I’m standing room full sawdust drop single lit match. It’s match, flamethrower. It’s drop bucket. big deal. 

The room next 100 people it. There’s reason worry one little match can’t hurt anyone. Honestly, don’t even need know dropped lit match room full flammable material. match won’t even reach them. New strains literally happen people actually followed rules. We're letting people die cos people want slightly inconvenienced. think correct move federal government go hands actual vaccination component process basically let state government 'figure out' know tell you. 

It's ridiculous states essentially act alone, without significant federal support get vaccinations arms. 

You stay home wear mask like, apologizing defending federal government completely inane. think yet known. also don’t know there’s difference mortality rate yet. Actually yes would, would never expect world stop me, mean .

It would honestly pretty selfish expected anyone hold “variants” everywhere, thats coronavirus time. glad mutation rate low compared viruses admit arm much sore flu shot, say particularly bad, side effects mild bargaining even related i.e. whether fatigued tired 4 hour sleep previous night, slight headache dehydrated.

S. Korea reports COVID-19 variant infections 

... 

COVID-19 cases tied Seoul prison reach 762; 1 inmate dies treatment Ehh, I'd okay getting two jabs arm every year can't combine vaccines. really need public information campaign try dispel nutjobs running around nowadays trying delegitimize vaccines. loosened things got better tightened got worse.

And never true lockdown. Well, Obama-era CDC let H1N1 came Mexico spread USA world? stopped it, used lot N95 masks stockpile H1N1 everywhere anyway. really acted early declared pandemic, promptly got criticised ""overreaction"" H1N1 2011 ""mild"".

Well, US acted pretty much way COVID-19 HIV H1N1, 1918 2011. strain name, cautious? Instead went ""fuck it, let's wait see"" thank Heavens rather mild. hand, over-corrected time COVID waited long time declaring ""pandemic"". 

Essentially, CDC good announcing things actually much command control manners. CDC actually authority anything anyway. roles authorities like ""suggestions"".

The libertarians CATO opined essentially, CDC appeared want prevent private labs making much money crisis; authorise private labs use develop test kits first months pandemic. Yet, 1) CDC failed make test work 2) authorise others labs use tests. month, US flying blind zero testing capability COVID absolutely everywhere. failure cannot blamed Trump Trump administration; 100% CDC's professional failure still idea happened.

Beyond point, know COVID everywhere something needed done, rooms criticise Trump administration. People need get onboard vaccines...this 2020...flu vaccines good, COVID vaccines essential. Time wake up, stop politicizing science medicine get vaccine ASAP Several countries *did* decide end pandemic, great deal success. They’re obviously going much problem new strain.  population New York City [8.3 million 

8,300,000 / 12,000 = 691.67 days

691.97 / 365 = 1.89 years. 

This failed vaccination program looks like. 

8,300,000 / 180 days = 46,111.11 vaccinations per day. 

46,111.11 / 12,000 = 3.84 times 

Celebrate daily number increases, continually sustained, factor 4.

That's success looks like. 70% confirmed. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ohhhh yeah Palowski punchable face...... that's want. claim validation babyish attention seeking. Like screeching baby crying morons went freedom rallies downtown months.... kind messup turn pro ***exit eu. 2019 pro EU I'm totally leaving. lol Homeless people avoided like plague general population outside pandemic. one probably avoid even more. 

It doesn’t take rocket scientist understand air flow dynamics outdoor setting don’t contribute spread virus. pandemic affects everyone, usual suspects SJW nonprofit workers came force campaign giving homeless places sleep indoors get vaccine general public they’re “uniquely vulnerable”. Except they’re not. putting hotels worse giving space sleep outside. 

I hate every single marginalized group tried make claim people somehow vulnerable virus deserve special treatment. Especially biggest factor determining someone suffer severe illness age.  mean hypothetical absence vaccine, enough people would acquired recovered natural infection virus would longer enough potential vectors available spread uncontrolled manner (community spread). words, natural herd immunity. know that's dirty word around try avoid using it. Right, that's part hearing stories hearing happens kids old people getting vaccinated. Although refusal mask lot areas longer believe small town lore care tbh. start thought big cities would anti mask small towns would covered care maw paw. Oops. polio vaccine HUGE HUGE deal back then, surprising many baby boomers totally forgot important get it. also lot cost, rhe AZ vaccine far cheapest. UK also secured enough vaccines across manufacturers give person 5 doses. Oh god saw word end endemic got scared. get problem like Stanford administrators hogging Healthcare workers. reality HCW need first keep hospitals afloat. vaccinate ones risk getting first. dont? 3400 deaths Tuesday. deaths Thanksgiving. 
 
When see Christmas surge pass 5k. 

RemindME! 4 weeks ""check covid deaths"" still see folks YouTube channels living cali wearing masks giving fuck “We find COVID-19 likely become leading cause death—surpassing unintentional overdoses—among young adults aged 25-44 areas United States substantial COVID-19  complaining remaining 3 days seems hard round stupid trolling us liberal tears... i'm taking em word...and educated..... wonder people like ever stop take moment think everything say gets downvoted oblivion... 

Nah, everyone else stupid card carrying mensa super genius process dessiminate information multiple dimensions.

Heh  corrupt organization controlled CCP mainly. jobs right, virus would never spread beyond Wuhan first placs. 

Its CCP's favor keep paralyzing economies societies influence grow stronger. sorry im well versed kind thing:does mean viral load concentrated meaning droplet? originally bat virus. spread humans still mystery one believes anymore happened Wuhan wet market - simply site largest known early outbreak.  Totally agree. Treat everyone like could kill getting close. viral load high enough there's nothing save you. Alright man, whatever.

I know think sounds super smart witty. come arrogant. ""26 athletes"" ""findings...suggestive prior myocardial injury"" - exactly scary headline here. Worth study? Sure. Claiming actually heart damage, however, linked COVID (which study seem go far say)? point. even look athletes without COVID control group. 6 months. thats estimate. Pray never experience all, man knows nothing deaths time table, Man!! We've conditioned think America best country world live in. handling virus drives stake heart claim. get saying that's definitely ""only"" factor worth considering. Especially talking holiday causes lot time labs administrative offices reporting happens. Even trends extremely similar magnitude change bigger. mil one know. retail

Lol state would States United failed Federal government? Look, current Prez never given flying fuck pandemic, ever. 

He simply give two shits people die get vaccine not. makes different all. Really thats it. do. Thank much. What? Like read back tell f said. know thank goodness well adult soon. Biden's goal 100million doses 100 days still impressive. means 15% US inoculated May 1st? That's totally unacceptable. Israel almost 6% right now. point lot public health officials economists need start hammering away. pandemic affected men far worse women systematically Yeah, that's exactly issue. I'm sort person says things like ""BACON: cure vegetarianism!"". I

Yikes. Imagine somebody supports torture slaughter animals taste buds (via milk dairy industries) unironically taking moral high ground issue.

In experience, real cure vegetarianism exposing people hope awful dairy egg farming is. quite confused seem understand flu vaccines differ Covid vaccines. Covid flu different vaccines made different methods. available flu vaccines use eggs production. learn flu vaccines Okay two shots, good info PR, complete overhaul health care industry. Anyone need anything else? want make two trips. unfortunate unlucky. believe according statistics, less 2 people age 30 die Covid day, probably less number car accident victims. Thats fucking ominous. uks rate doubled-tripled early Nov. point new shutdowns decreasing daily cases.

so... 4-600,000 daily cases possible exact scenario occure. US EU sanction arresting officer judge. 
This nice lady clearly doesn’t belong jail, she’s mentally ducked up.
Please send money provide visa able seek treatment west. Centers Diseases Control Prevention controlled prevented nothing. 8 billion dollar losing proposition. Clearly serious one considering rock climber. mean, reason can't vaccinate million people per day. enough supply that. vaccines began two weeks ago, 16 million reach. 

It obviously is, Donald Trump GOP decided slow people die. be. France given 100 vaccines three days. Calm down. stated another post one US fully vaccinated yet.., FAIL. War welcome development state!! I'm putting another 6+ months crap.

When vaccinate vulnerable 10% population, risk hospitals overwhelmed gone. paid tens millions dollars summer?

Did get receipt? frontline physician, trust know. 

We still humans though. antagonism dehumanization others big reason folks don’t trust you, science, media. 

If we’re willing denigrate dead congressman father children minutes death, we’re bad Biden said he’s president they’re planning 1 million vaccinations day least, little bit longer incompetent administration. time said that, evidence. hilarious sad people claim ""follow science"" get upset people do.  Yeah, currently Seattle flu study (that going years) almost completely switched gears assessing testing covid (though still call flu study). Red River? many CA report today? last week? 40K day almost week straight...but let's talk TX. know 1, uncle ER dr major city think governors quite happy slow pace. little desire end this. old man Shakespeare? :D Fear porn. dozens kn95 boxes local Lowe’s today, I’m sure they’re stores country you’re located US year full curiosity!! hits us daily numbers double like uk's.

we havn't gotten yet. do; nightmare BEGINS, unless half severity Wendsday.... O2 run out, beds, workers... think golden rule going override guidance regulations regarding vaccine distribution. ones gold first get vaccinated. Probably ..... Sorry she? mean yeah, children's health advocate something?    Can’t wait online school next week welcome back students.... think depends crime committed honest you.

A petty thief, sure... convicted murderer serving life? I’m okay cuffs. Thank much. earth ...erm...get ...er...'grad school' without one hour spent one class relating reading comprehension?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

It's Christmas miracle! isn’t bubonic fucking plague, let’s take notch wishing ill upon others, need go holier thou “you’re threat community” bs, it’s serious. Keep you’re distance others part, it’s really quite simple. whole d-bag calling people selfish making look like pile garbage. get life insurance get covid? disagree, RESPONDING Trump saying, ""Yeah vaccine come October safe yada yada yada"" without single scientist stand next confirm it..... saying take vaccine soon confirmed scientific community approved. 

You get mad right wing pundits taking one sentence usual blowing huge negative headline.  Even pandemic kept droning coworkers 50 years office campuses like would used public housing something heh Hopefully that's ""bottleneck"" we'll get past soon.

the line criteria overly complicated subjective, bunch ""phases"" make people feel good. done age, scrapped healthcare workers essential workers. complain year middle wisdom, (covid-19) remains 3 days shutdown complain.
All praying 2021 like sucked terrible year lost many love one's. government remain control utilities one government run bank charge universal health care system.
Not saying can’t banks one government run bank fee accounts low income people help keep banks line.
That way get stable business costs.
There also liveable minimum wage. type healthcare worker deserves recognition, can’t imagine deal I’m grateful people like you. Thank ever risk. still potentially spreading virus others everyone pre-existing conditions isolate completely. literally rising killing people premise probably you. guess strong argument psychopath.  Houston’s cases are, relatively speaking, bad. current best guess hantavirus. US probably COVID variants. federal government policy get many people sick possible 9 months. something anecdotal add: I've completely indoors since February besides get grocery curbside pickup takeout. tested positive today. Texas highest case total yet: going get virus y'all. sound alarmist mRNA vaccines herd-immunity generators need. What? 15 million doses delivered. states ones taking long administer them. 1.1? Wait, what's R0 main variant?? friend fireman got today Agreed. Billionaire oligarchs poor powerless pandemic, needs changed soon possible.  Yeah, whether one agrees current situation, he’s still kind doctor traveled ebola hot zone Congo help. doesn’t make immune criticism make immune labeled mengele, murderer whatnot. That’s want think. you’ve cellphone reception past year, Bill Gates already knows every single bowel movement you’ve had. /s Jesus Christ... one cost less? limited budget clear, really mean life super-disrupted state forever. case numbers remain low, life generally resume most. course, likely good bit digital transformation brought pandemic stick, get freaked this. logic also know long term effects people who've never infected before. little concerned first, mostly autoimmunity issues reading spike proteins actually eventually get recognized immune system reality simply risk causing autoimmune issues far lower actual virus. vaccine works almost infected virus took cells produce components, except producing spike.

Is risk long term effects zero? No, that's likely see people get Bell's Palsy, viral illnesses certain people whose immune systems behave incorrectly. there's valid reason fear vaccine disease virus hijacks cells produce exact spike protein, except also produces entire rest case makes much sicker much likely bad long term effects.

Either way, already sick likely immune time (about 7 months minimum best guess) got sick wait data available. time immunity wears tens millions people vaccines months really horrifying autoimmune issues side effects know. like study 40,000 people, inject literally tens millions people even rare effects much obvious quickly. mRNA breaks quickly like long term effect staying body forever frankly makes sense autoimmune issues years later surface rapidly.

Your fears honestly unfounded, already sick let people get priority anyway. I'm focusing 7-day average that's good metric cases, there's way much variation single day figures. first successfully-spreading gathering enough one. lol cool let murderers free range whatever want nurses mRNA vaccines tricky handle. It’s injection itself. everything that. 

You can’t distribute anyone all. May live interesting times. IIRC 40-50% Americans get yearly flu shot according cdc Ah makes sense. I'll take one! Gross incompetence, gross negligence? Giving vaccines better giving vaccines. Cool, right! surprised design. give next admin hardest job possible. 

It makes sense mobilizimg everything got right now. Mt wife goes tomorrow, missed appointment last week day check texts, healthcare worker btw give treatment smokers get lung cancer, give treatment diabetes people unhealthy lifestyles. covid treated differently didn’t forget. elected somebody undermined Postal Service. thing happening coronavirus. problem governors allowed make decisions? tell me, isolating family? stay isolated every singe one gets vaccinated? don't, seeing all? 

I can't control people do. control actions. choose wear mask, social distance, get vaccinated help prevent spread Covid. suggesting stay away every unvaccinated person next year--or however long takes--I hope willing same. know 8 (I work healthcare). husband got last Tuesday Christmas. Using Defense Act going big production, well. raw materials ended smaller shipments Pfizer begin with. think real reason they're worried farmers get death threats harassment. Yep, mine too. want children safe. since kids can’t vaccinated yet, want every single able adult get thing ASAP. hate anyone counting single dosage vaccine. misleading. it’s effective two doses count one vaccine. patiently wait sake others community

Have fun locking another five years lmao  know someone flew yesterday Midwest UK. sure hope follow quarantine. would good way increase talks North Korea offer vaccines know 4, 5 count notary’s wife...even though we’ve never met never see again. fair, state level. state charge distribution. MA, communication pretty good. don’t know are, assume communication good Yet US sequencing less 2% specimens... guess don’t test it, can’t find it. it’s problem, right? mindset damaging potential future. scary.  Oh sweet summer child. things careful using terms like ""any"". Toxoplasma one exceptions lethal host increases reproductive fitness parasite. Yes, do. That's irrelevant. still means means. talking people Reservations. huge infrastructure serve them. Moreover, they're closed easily 6 months, out, forget returning.  not, people? Whites ancient, living trailers middle nowhere, response growing old broke, number reasons, best hardship couldn't. first society wants vax. Jesus life worth little? closer 2% risk, 1/50 chance die. that's even mentioning forms life long damage possible, depressed rest life reduced lung capacity sense taste. Also, ~2mil number confirmed deaths. Based level testing different countries including US, different countries counting deaths etc., actual number could much much higher. Spanish Flu, took nearly 50-70 years experts put together true mortality. two years back [another study][1] came another estimate death toll. COVID would take least 5-10 years get idea real damage even time get accurate estimates.

[1]: That's ironic bit anti vaxxers. majority vaccinated past yet turned fine(unless count stupidity) yet still insist vaccines harmful lool. Politics. sort sub, c'est la vie. There's usually decent data mixed though :) really want get vaccine I’ve read people allergies cautious. I’ve got allergy Penicillin Pertussis really don’t want feel throat start closing up, terrifies me.

I also work hospital, it’s huge dilemma country back open people finally decide open. Hopefully people finally fed lies goalpost moving months. Initially AZ Vaccine made 40% total US vaccine purchases presumably offering much less mRNA vaccines. That’s conditoned receiving FDA approval seems far off. US bought 100 million Pfizer vaccine option buy 500 million started order Pfizer vaccine compensate assumption AZs vaccine. I'm embarrassed American.  suck bad. We've 9 months prepare nobody clue what's going on. We're 2.1 million doses administered 15 days. Pathetic.  know that’s March?  asthma husband essential worker retail.... GIMME GIMME GIMME. patiently wait sake others community get one soon get access one. vacationing countries allowed Ontario lockdown? people Province able fly country fun? idiot. comment I’d expect Trump. US country forgot deliver mail timely accurate way. Time hit snacks qualify vaccine then? Joking... part... congrats keep good work! 9 (family friends health public health) Multiple animal reservoirs. Worldwide spread. going away. Simple geometry... There's 3000 people county. 300 city. last 3 months, I've within sight less 100 people, 100 within sight thousand, tops.

Go two hours away nearest best buy, walk in, buy TV, leave, walked past bunch people who've within sight distance millions within past week.

More significantly, given day, give names addresses every single person town feeling hot. I'm feeling punchy, let jeanne diner know, within hours, everyone know, there's pandemic... 

There's 14 cases county. One school bus driver, single kid come positive, testing every Saturday, hauls around 30 kids little metal box, there's pandemic... 

Rural areas bunch idiots wearing masks though... Lol  Well r/nextfuckinglevel ,,,if it. US orange Trump thing running show. Sooooo Dr. says so. know it’s gonna happen. Yeah. Got ankylosing spondylitis 17 recently turned 30. fortunate enough fantastic team specialists spending time medical research disease hasn’t progressed much though constantly handful manage. 

My rheumatologist mentioned usually older patients don’t much reaction vaccines younger ones range kinds body aches experienced way needing 3 months prednisone keep things control. Seems like younger immune system, even immunosuppressive drugs, mount quite response. problem targeting people likely transmit virus targeting people likely already contracted virus, therefore wasting vaccine. way elderly first. find competent epidemiologist says way save lives.  medical worker could give IM injections. given many wife years past. why, commenter AToiletSeat, still advised wear mask vaccinated youre immune, claim. 1% planes crashed, nobody would ride plane anymore.

That's convinced republican friend kept going 99% survival rate talking point.  prob normal summer part helps. guarantee 20% country new strain end 2020/beginning 2021. recall correctly, least parts California allowed eat-in dining restaurants weeks ago. Also, keep mind year-round nice weather means many Californians need snow feel cold, may hanging inside expect. maybe got complacent. know find sure.  No, eventually acquire enough immunity reduce hospital loads manageable level relax restrictions. COVID probably keep killing 50-100k people per year US, would spread entire year easy manage. like marvel universe? kidding? They’ve said repeatedly since March  young lady medical worker told Monday getting vaccinated Tuesday. true. hospital also super maxed capacity. finding place people anywhere everywhere. Also running place put dead. Sorry, Florida cooks books, numbers mean next nothing. think maybe Anthony Fauci put best general true; however short period time unlikely would evolutionary pressure either way based lethality.

Mutations affecting lethality usually arise independent mutations affecting transmission. Internet Explorer level delay: *how use hydroxychloroquine?* Yep. Let's surprised Thanksgiving everyone business usual holidays. Even stores operating well 20% capacity. Thanksgiving, xmas another boost NYE. 

Also, confusion vaccine is...

Vaccine preventive treatment. I’m citizen I’ve staying home taking precautions. I’m sorry. Wishing something could say help more. Just, thank you, truly. strongly disagree you. statements Stockholm achieve herd immunity May/June/July, second wave autumn Sweden, closing borders useless Swedish tourists ""safer"" partial herd immunity (this one harder source, pretty sure said it) probably led increased deaths globally. Especially vocal Sweden's approach unnecessarily many interviews. 2020: 2021: Final Showdown alternative crippling depression and/or staying locked inside two years, sure. I’ll take 1% risk. understanding viruses survive mutated summer fall 1919 causing less death slowly reached herd immunity. read anything Spanish Flu becoming contagious (highly so) one has. it’s hoax. Doubt it. Herman Cain died Covid twitter still spouting Republican talking point it.

It's insanity. Even covid 1% death rate, everyone catches it, that's 3 million dead people US. Plus time people hospital clogging ends killing others.

Someone needs pay spreading bullshit. shit, 200+ million people get vaccinated start normal ish life.

It amazes people think week first vaccinations means care anymore.

They've even vaccinated 1% population, course going make impact.  Id rather weighted lottery sort mom co workers (front line) certain it’s direct correlation. healthy individuals. indicative immune system strengthening.

Coupled fact different organs show different ppm concentrations studies shows body directly uses element differently organ therefore perhaps essential human life. 

If inessential wouldn’t ppm would same? I'm sorry going this, internet stranger. right, administration failing you. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry died. People really need take virus seriously. Luke covid denier. Even believe virus, political reasons, whatever, worn mask young kids sake. sight, mind. shit? UK severely bungled response (with perhaps singular exception hard lockdown early on) hopeful well vaccine rollouts. quite miserable here. : ( what’s next precautionary step take? Best wishes  CVS/Walgreens actually enforce post-vaccination waiting period. would cause customer complaints. say now? Well isn’t interesting. else say ? reading /r/Coronavirus though? US called failed state poorly vaccines even though objectively least fourth-best world. 0,8% IFR, validating [this report, table 2 page Lol, saw countless pictures countries' first vaccinated persons past days. female. thinking different registry on. IMO, kids primary vector spreading infection. might get sniffles, but, grandma gets whole combo plate. do, mostly lot friends medical residents easily achieved! ICU nurses might tired accepting everyone already infected anyway. bother rubber boots already neck deep water? guess follow would be...

I think sore arm better getting Covid potentially getting really sick dead.  Thrty somehow secured vaccines Germany 9x population home Biontech. Apparently pay extra politicians directly communicated Pfizer, whatever means. r/collapse gone batshit crazy vaccines No, situation 50 100 do. nurse get second dose yet need 12 14 days someone get protection virus. Absolutely chance Brits get shit together vaccinate 2 million people week. religious fanfiction

won't save (Reuters) - speed patients' antibody production, rather volume antibodies produce fight new coronavirus, may determine whether survive COVID-19, new data suggest.

Researchers studied 200 COVID-19 patients, including 179 hospitalized, found produced neutralizing antibodies within 14 days developing symptoms eventually recovered, produce neutralizing antibodies 14 days elapsed developed higher viral loads severe disease.

""It unclear antibodies generated time point unable promote viral clearance recovery COVID-19 patients,"" researchers said report posted medRxiv ahead peer review.

Study leader Akiko Iwasaki Yale University School Medicine tweeted Saturday, ""It's possible virus somehow becomes resistant hiding inaccessible tissues.""

The new findings, added, suggest therapy so-called monoclonal antibody drugs - Regeneron given U.S. President Donald Trump -- likely work used soon infection. NEW STRAINNNNNNNN!!!!! crucial part ""could"". Britain still member would substantial pressure follow route rest EU. 

At least, decision forego EU solidarity area lead fast rollout, whether EU membership forced not. Idk. bunch people don’t get vaccine every year. parents medical professionals told Sharp herd immunity estimated require 77% population get vaccinated. That’s ton people every year. They’re also told vaccine might even last full year (we might getting booster shots 6 months vaccination) . think we’ll see companies government get really strict vaccines order reach high threshold 77% won’t ever shut again. We’ll see people getting banned work public activities without proof vaccination we’ll make sure everyone travels vaccinated too. good news MRNA vaccines much easier make old ones. vaccine creation quick every year w/o scientific frustration/ lag time. desired result 53% immune, yes - 12 days goal. 

But 53% isn’t effective immunity pro CCP subreddit profit, mainly. people feel positive, live lives. feel panicked, stay glued news. explains sloped brows without masks enough. Anyone vaccinated still 2-weeks quarantine entering country pay it, least next couple years ... said scientific evidence saying though maybe weak. 
You aren’t consistent all. Narrator:*They didn't* really disagree that. think people happy many many doses (like 15 million) sent given. rate 2021 suck much 2020.

The good sitting shelf. needs way better coordination effort going actually giving shot out. Well going lot homeless soon, less infections? Maybe.

/s Must commander tweet recovered fast shots

Lmao no. needed another reason skip shit. jumping line already told place line? mean, given rate break, that’d terrible idea. DoD ton civilian vehicles. importantly workforce good setting lines people, $25 lot. used eat $4-$5 day.

For others, it’s matter breaking bank, people generally don’t much money entertainment, leisure, emergency. 

If need drop $100 family 4 get vaccinated, versus getting flu normalized, choice easy. Source 50% number? I've read one dose 80%+ (another commenter sourced already). really? posted article took ‘They don’t need viral design articles here’ words mine. can’t post anything like else fear mongering. however think important people realize vaccine isn’t instant fix. People saying Antivaxxers think means shot gave virus, don’t think give enough credit. aren’t dumb aren’t getting vaccine regardless. ibtimes.sg may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Reuters) - specific form protein passed Neanderthals protects severe COVID-19, according study reported medRxiv ahead peer review.

Existing medications boost levels protein could potentially help treat disease, researchers say.

The protein, called OAS1, involved immune response viruses. People higher levels Neanderthal-related form OAS1 less susceptible COVID-19, become infected, lower risk hospitalization, intubation death, researchers found.

""This protective form OAS1 present sub-Saharan Africans lost ancestors modern-day Europeans migrated Africa. re-introduced European population mating Neanderthals"" lived 40,000 years ago, said coauthor Brent Richards Jewish General Hospital McGill University Montreal.

1 mil per week 50 mil per year ( rounded)

330 mil population, 6 years (still unacceptable) 20.

What missing?  n outs god damn jesus freaks when’s going stop?

it unless start bully (i.e. sanctions).

china give flying fuck, 1.4 billion people want take world (and let continue).

the good news world outnumbers 6 1. vaccines? Post flu shot year (following rona test), stood walked home Mankind remotely capable creating virus. making vaccine like making wooden horse trees, making virus like inventing tree. 50% population tested way [rapid antigen] every 4 days, achieve vaccine-like “herd effects” (which onward transmission virus across population cannot sustain itself—like taking fuel fire—and outbreak collapses).

I agree rollout rapid antigen test public may help slow spread. Asking people take one leave house along protecting paying workers stay home would hopefully reduce number cases walking around. many people go even confirmed positive PCR test, yes, even symptoms, may successful claims. still think it’s worth trying hope new administration gives strategy serious look. 

 Rapid antigen tests fail safe guarantee can’t pass virus on, author even acknowledges “Importantly though, frequent rapid testing necessarily replace test-trace isolate mitigation strategies, exist parallel”. would another step help slow infection rate, stand alone answer.

Rapid antigen tests detect low levels virus, incubation period someone test negative low levels ramp quickly high levels, leading good possibility infecting around social gathering. It’s basically article says “hurry f’up”. It’s cause concern, manage vaccinate 40% flu every year months time, zero pressure urgency didnt know date hoping everyone vaccinated by. like special Pokémon event code get GS Ball?

All countries stay away vaccine. UK take hit nasty vaccine. biggest concern. keep seing people say get heard immunity vaccine need everyone full idiots refuse deserve most. Thanks service.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Happy New Year’s Eve Eve… hopefully shit doesn’t get much worse much longer someone scientific knowledge help out..

I think covid back early February. say good friend mine works boarding school caters mostly Chinese students (several fact Wuhan, went home Christmas). Around January 2020 numerous students/staff flu school, including friend. met friend drink feeling slightly better still little bit rough. days later, early February, go flu-type symptoms (fever, cough, temperature). cannot confirm whether covid not. 

Now work education setting, contact students stuff turned positive cases time, multiple times. fact, class turned 7 people class got covid. 

I symptoms ill since flu February. 

Now assuming covid, possible body keeps creating antibodies every time I'm exposed? I'm aware immunity typically lasts months, keep exposed, could last longer?

I know way confirm antibody test, I'm thinking chances catching close 0, given I've contact many times. 9 News requested interview her, told hospital asking privacy.

This fuelled conspiracy theories - questioning reluctance speak, despite continuing interviews minutes fall."" take it? Definitely rich elite though. abide rules do. seriously believe otherwise, bridge sell you. say socialism 🤯 Sure, obviously rate vaccination going increase point enough vaccines general populace anyone go CVS get vaccinated.

Just extrapolating first week two vaccinations really valid data set. agree man, see website disturbing frequency. told us put weight one leg Yep. definitely issues sometimes, Israel's healthcare system, least basic everyday stuff, impressive. I'm due go surgery next month, decided use private supplemental insurance choose surgeon, I'd used public healthcare would gotten another surgeon department, gotten surgery date.

Earlier month gallstone hurt like motherfucker (pardon language), pass. 11 hours nonstop pain. Finally go urgent care I'm seen within 20 minutes. take blood, see GP, get referred surgeon, see surgeon within 5 minutes, get referred ER, take cab ER seen surgical resident within another 30 minutes (see triage nurse within 15 minutes). Things kinda went downhill there. One nurse assumed drug seeking kinda left bed ER without attention long time, eventually got moved surgery wing spent 4 days recovering.

Total expenses pocket: zero. appears gradual process, immunity starts growing \~10 days first shot. need second shot 3 weeks let immunity grow even more.

6 days first shot, like case, probably enough even basic kind protection. Poor nurse, vaccination days earlier luck might prevented infection. Look man, I’m sorry born way. way live. can’t keep lockdowns going forever, even people lose jobs homes.

It’s better greater good highly vulnerable quarantined rest us continue working Yes, Israel Bahrain lead world per capita. better literally everywhere Israel/Bahrain/UK terms per capita done total world. well, we're better almost anywhere else. Seems days (if before) $$$ Maria Shriver immune!!! still tell COVID deniers maybe they'll part stop Chinese invasion country.

But realistically, won't, they'll complicit Chinese invasion country. actually make changes stop it, suddenly think one more! call morning responding to? GO!!!! Yeah, it’s called Moderna vaccine lol also idea vaccines prevent transmission. know decreases severity covid symptoms, sterilizing immunity unknown. it’s important vaccinated individuals continue masking physical distancing protocols case doesn’t prevent significantly reduce transmission. Major cities shut months. He's bullshitting, US buy billion doses, argument refutation since Canada, example, slated 5x population vaccines. Combo hedging bets different manufacturers, donating excess poorer nations. mean I’m perfectly fine staying home getting high af daily, try force complete lifestyle others, well maybe staying home park whenever possible often would helped Also, strains variants simply die out. advantage widespread infection... job candidates impaired... No, control federal government. control state governments. combo everything. I've disease 5 years learn time goes by. I'm fortunate always worked home feel leave house, don't. I'm remission, feel better course I'm anxious although still always know restroom know needed, setup helps reduce anxiety. First time seeing I'm sorry seen undesirable locations already. think important stay up-to-date news , found could still get virus even first shot I'm glad story posted. guess bad news banned, exist. Magical thinking got us pickle, ""warp speed"" travesty ignored.

At mere 200K day, vaccinated YEARS. isnt 100's varients, one highly infectious? tragic, tragic? state released tiered plan rough timelines. Now-Feb healthcare, elderly, outpatient. Feb-April tier 2 covers public workers, teachers, etc along people 2 comorbities. 3rd tier general public listed April-June.

I fallnin tier 2, figure around Feb give Dr call see. 1st one. next school board. Pfizer stay cooling 5 days cut number simply wearing mask. Warp Speed unambiguous American triumph world thankful for. still think feds regulators drug feet late stages much, yeah we're conditioned viewing everything shit show Trump involved. that.  comment legit made double take WTF Hey, background geologist (so, virologist I’m reasonably comfortable reading science literature) I’m hard time research new variants. I’m hoping answer simple questions, like “Are current PCR Covid tests actually testing new variants?” “What new variants called?”... point right direction? hoping would new subreddit now, dice. girlfriend pretty ill, although tested negative past week, symptoms line perfectly Covid. people keep reading articles soon end loony bin. already seen article posted anti vaxers lunatics social media.I think rather informing people adds fuel conspiracists fire.The title doesnt help either. Thank think may half asleep missed part.

Totally agree , done fantastically well vaccine. 

I focused compliance self responsibility think. 
I stand corrected friend. mostly limited delivery contracts countries negotiated.

Israel got priority, got shit together actually vaccinating people. Distribution easy. Scheduling throughput vaccination sites complex, still rocket science, course.

If country challenged transporting packages hundred miles, task made extra easy Biontech/Pfizer special packaging, expect years Covid come. problem. point pandemic glove box full badges different hospitals. half well Israel, we'd vaccinating 3 million people day. Yes suppose Yin ""We've got live lives"" yang ""We've got die deaths."" Yes, scientists say likely, good reasons think - also lab experiments.

But, way people vaccinated variants become dominant, replicate quickly. Vaccination might complete year now, vaccine yet produced. new strain seems able duplicate every week even ""Tier 3"" restrictions active UK (not full lock-down like Spain Italy did, least paper rather strict). Duplicating every week means one case would imported now, would one million cases 19 weeks now.

I really want frighten people seem yet grasped means. Especially U.S. weak institutional response weak compliance strict measures, far far dangerous original emergence virus Wuhan. understand young, healthy people (below age 40) can't volunteer administer doses mass vaccination sites then. worries cost case shifts place able vaccinate 24/7 next shipment arrives. recycled fear mongering article. turned 4 athletes nobody idea hearts looked liked Covid. Garbage You’re assuming choice though come immense pressure approve it, however, AZ vaccine rolled UK 4th January onward. Moderna deliver 80 million doses vaccine EU. N95 get saddle share optimism vaccine, frustrated leadership's failures lead. needlessly destroyed many lives, I'm tired people complaining fear mongering, fear mongerers were, continue right because, know... Science. lot people think get first shot immune. important acknowledge risk still even first shot tell. still news still important know things, calm down. Would absolutely major setback. muscles atrophy 10 days, bed rest means conditioning gone soon. would set average D1 player back year best case scenario. 

With isolated injuries like knee, ankle, shoulder, ect. would able work enough help battle atrophy, conditioning coordination exercise. blown knee would set back year so, thats mostly stabilizing knee getting muscles back (PT). even though year might right back normal sometimes even better; always though. leaving aside how, case, ""more transmissible"" mean ""less deadly"" - *is* mutation exhibits different behavior. finding mutation happens exact mortality? There's lot differences size, Israel less perfect still robust public health system every person required member HMO. Also military stepped help logistics.

They also months experience mass testing drive somewhat similar nature mass vaccine drive. No. Antibiotics work viruses. splitting hairs. getting first shot second shot still vulnerable infection? think Israel handles kind stuff palestinian territories.
That kind stuff usually responsibility government, Palestinian Authorities.
Maybe vaccine shared though since extras know. Obviously powerful enough get cure available Trump friends ""I BUDS"" surprised. tired sad. Checking sub reddit daily leave mental insitutions Covid long gone. panic spreading place. sad regardless. swedish nipple called bröstvårta, ""breastwart"", pretty nice Yeah. least American age cohort, got polio vaccine drops sugar cube. oral vaccine got many dozens (Army, served overseas). “Drops” seems appropriate description. polio vaccine given orally. common back early days Polio vaccination. Nebraska growth daily cases since big surge Oct/Nov. Also hospitalizations 40%. I'm wondering new strains get us yet something. Lower what? That's literally 99.9% positive rate. Whats worse shots first 2-3 weeks constantly sick overnight bunch people different background different regions shoved compartment together given 10 minutes 90 cycle shower. 

Boot camp nasty. country well-staffed vaccine lab everything need start making bioweapons. say, really different end It’s heartbreaking see uneducated, anti-mask, plain idiotic conspiracy theorists throughout US. mother’s rural town absolute shit show right ignorance defiance. feel bad healthcare workers frontline employees putting risk every day. hope impact district lives saved learning this. Maybe tripped big pile stupid. question though since used term likely. number percent would give likely starting U.S.? need ""prescriber"" jab someone, otherwise need supervised someone is. Maybe they'll relax rules Oxford preloaded syringe super simple. Here's hoping! Covid date striving hit terms everyone Vaccinated? Let’s fucking hope so! consider like Texas. Freedom, guns BBQ implying secretly control China somehow they're able prevent *every single leak*? initial Wuhan wave everything live streams satellite footage showing us government story trusted, really find idea completely silent disaster believable. Two dozen LA? sequence single positive test Iceland. We've seen cases UK variant they've contained border far community spread yet. hopes best.

The motto healthcare American. break quarantine move together ❤ 
you'd make bubble safe. 
good luck economy thanks sacrifice. Pfizer approval, mentioned UK look raw data like U.S. EU. Also astrazenica vaccine least one known red flag making dosage mistake. may led higher scrutiny reluctance emergency approval. Anthrax vaccines several people adverse reactions point flown off. least ship prepared system. seriously doubt CVS/Walgreens going capable handling situation dealing possible adverse reaction even odds relatively low like one thousand something. going overwhelmed logistics dispensing high number vaccines tracking everything associated that. I've seen happen people moderately dehydrated, rather stressful week. Seems needle work trigger it; blood draw, injection, IV insert etc. 20,000,000 first doses allotted.

I really understand federal government also gone last mile administer them. OWS quite successful things put charge of. letting myriad entities create bottleneck?  Im sure CVS handle negative 20 either. problem enough people available take vial opened need expand vaccinating. Trying perfect means sitting vaccines could used. I've lived whole life know anyone thinks he's done anything right pandemic voted him.

His inability govern led thousands deaths, mention people major health issues rest lives infected. Counting hospitals, urgent care, major pharmacy locations (not counting local pharmacy general care providers) 43,369 locations qualified give least flu shot. average 70 injections day per location. 
3,000,000 day difficult do, producing distribution 3,000,000 day may prove difficult nuts No, affects old people pre-existing conditions! /s mRNA seems way go, hope new tech means eradication even stubborn viruses eluded immunity HIV  didn’t say contracting covid crime. I’m saying certain circumstances, justice system blame individuals refuse take precautions. law considers people knowingly spread deadly disease criminals.

This congressman aware virus ravaging community. aware transmit without symptoms. refused part prevent asymptomatic spread, likely gave covid multiple others. enabled virus. Hence, virus enabler. Wow. highschool San Diego CA 500 students recall. yeah pretty bad either way. Apparently ran month ago believe every headline. Biden’s first act enact Defense Production Act. Make business manufacture vaccine suitable amount. 

While would likely fought, mandate shipping companies, including Amazon Walmart, fleet vans trucks transport needed areas. 

What’s point acts, get renewed every year, you’re going leverage them?

Use might, speed power United States. “most powerful country world” show it. 

Enact DPA mobilize military deliver administer vaccines. guy chance get vaccinated despite parties insistence virus big deal concerned it? ""its like made this..."" hold hope maybe, maybe, death might reach scare members public flippant now. 41, seems like pretty good shape people can't go 'but muh comorbidities' dismiss it. 

I feel sorry children. kids young, they've lost dad. noted ""New Normal"" anything sustainable right now. Probably things like access health insurance, worker safety nets, functioning government least looks like gives sh\*t. Yeah thats fucking dream... get work 4 hours day don't, well dust resume find job like it.

At 40, possible change careers take care family single income. many people much free time pandemic, many us also got worked bone going worse January. Double work reduction job line deliver. Fucking trapped. stupid came lab Wuhan, China common knowledge?

This ""common knowledge"" ... link *primary source*... dare you! one. 

The virus created lab weapon. technology single instance happening before.

It's *POSSIBLE* lab studying something jumped past fuck would release **on people**. 

Dude. Get basic critical thinking skills. We're fucking pandemic. Act like responsible adult.

Occams Razor REALLY applies here. simplest explanation leaped species wet market KNOW viruses done past.

Also, reply source primary source I'm going ask delete Reddit account. Why? \*sneaks around randomly starts injecting people aren’t paying attention*

Oops. Yeah, FDA panel Pfizer debated it. don’t recall details, consensus vaccine study conducted specific protocol adhere that. personal opinion, vaccinated 1 shot, got covid within first week. Week 2 3 significant less covid cases. less effective, sure, could benefit society more? don’t data that. Near 80% good news. Time mass produce then. help required stop COVID. accumulate burn sick days defeats purpose. didn’t say contracting covid crime. I’m saying certain circumstances, justice system blame individuals refuse take precautions. law considers people knowingly spread deadly disease criminals.

This congressman aware virus ravaging community. aware transmit without symptoms. refused part prevent asymptomatic spread, likely gave covid multiple others. enabled virus. innocent. bad states could partner business thousands locations big parking lots, like Walmart Home Depot example. drive thru-shots 15 minute wait car designated area. Maybe car parked 15 minute wait lot, allow people get walk around store (masked course) want. 

Either way, matter job hospital, thank dealing risk stress all. HAHA China sucks. Can’t event get vaccine 90%. Bet wondering US smart. Fuck em. yet run out. Keep doubling dumb, enjoying it. Please also take consideration many people come serious case COVID19 requiring hospitalisation, many proved immune. 

None. 

So, rest vaccinated, turned coronavirus mild cold. That’s pretty important. Except people arent upset caught disease. People upset behaved selfishly recklessly put others greater risk. Cool. give us indication things speeding Yes...for me, I've working remotely since March can't imagine going back office. Working home change I'd like see compared pre-COVID life, pretty much necessity terms ability lead balanced, well-rounded life. remember getting 11 shots one day, arms sore it. pain equal single anthrax injection got later. one real pain. coffee I’d say it’s cheap. It’s hedge death. Insurance brokers say “it cheap”, better. $150 month 20 year policy lot money low statistical chance death. That’s lot dinner toys...or investments. sub nuts. want able go gym enjoy life. Everything else backburner. Thank concern, yes I’ve keeping eye symptoms besides weird chestache. Nothing far, hopefully indeed myocarditis goes away, I’m applying low income care program local hospital Jan 5 maybe I’ll able get checked out. that's keep wondering every time see increase numbers trends, virus infective people stopped giving fuck? Planning? US? Wrong state lol Yeah makes sense velocity also important. Sitting doses weeks dies one good. Let’s stick mfers! skews positive rate lower? follows r/tinder 
sadboy vibes Wow, 2 bears 1 cave. Hope Bret okay. Err. Yeah. That. Ok time crawl bed, many factual mistakes comments now. National guard? Military? Plenty corpsman. It’s actually like one M&amp;M’s kill you, it’s 1/4 actual single M&amp;M kill you. take chances would. ""But Susie accounts payable said would like shot vacation holidays let's hold one her!"" 
\-Hospitals

I legitimately cannot believe happening right now. Several weeks vaccinations, vast majority doses sit shelves. Doses starting go waste they're left fridge overnight. Doses never *in* fridge overnight - distributed day received! demand there. *fuck* hospitals doing? Long term start giving boosters every year, perhaps flu shot, Oxford vaccine would best way  Las Vegas No, six days, today reported even higher number. figures deaths time last 3 weeks. Whenever put ""sold"" scenario put profit motive equation bad mix given situation. 

How hospital get incentivized inoculate many possible bare minimum make outrageous profit vaccine doses essentially given them?

The government needs doses seeing already government outline administered instate stiff fines penalties follow rules curb selfishness greed already see creeping up. 

A Pharmacy already believed commited fraud NY, last. Argentina, around 300.000 people gonna vaccinated next days, million January. know people consider us transparent country, believe governmental agencies approved personally know lot doctors already got appointment get next days. Maybe lose funding. Oof, last 2 Bears 1 Cave podcast episode guest hosting, starting warm forgotten he’d said covid year. understand Astrazeneca vaccine already approved UK. even data it? explanation L.A. county worse time covid parts country ? different covid strain ? saw stories saying testing detected U.K. strain yet. I've seen people/articles claim Oxford vaccine higher efficacy space doses 28 days. article/paper released explains thoroughly? change want see labor laws improved globally culture working 60+hrs week office job getting paid 37.5 unacceptable illegal.

But happen. Happy new year. Unfortunately though see refuse even anything precautions wise. mean think way see, majority can't. Common sense common nowadays say much difference Pfizer Moderna. include all, yet approved ones, would choose J&amp;J. one jab also they’ve used technology vaccines before. long one unhealthiest impoverished states America, emerged one nation’s alarming coronavirus hot hospitals crisis virus rages control region high rates obesity, high blood pressure conditions make COVID-19 even dangerous, access health care limited even outbreak, public resistance masks precautions stubborn. idea efficacy? keep seeing 70%-90% He's still saying stupid put Twitter … wishing COVID positive test terrible acute febrile illness testing negative COVID, acute lymphocytic leukemia, want that’s thing would happening me

🙄  average gone up. looking closer 3 weeks 90% reporting rate. Someone else took virus seriously probably died denier got treatment hospital place. 

This asshole said everyone go back work sake economy. doesn’t care others, fuck care him? Obese know wear mask That's American thing only. country talks underlying conditions like do. American healthcare industry propaganda works. Thanks, sure video comments shocking!  Like literally salty feel sorry mask denier dead. Yeah, bunch agoraphobes validating eachother. worry, Australia start March officially ""On right track"" joke hospital nurse go drive public testing site rather access testing work.

It's product inefficient private healthcare system, who's gonna pay test? either health insurance inefficient channels, county health dept public test centers. hollywood actually decided put cash regular employee testing, apparently even hospitals will.

I recently encounter healthcare system wife tested admitted, let come test who's gonna pay it? insurance, health, insurance, I'm patient, hospital, they're charity, health dept public health issue private facility. conundrum leaves us result come healthcare setting prolonged period time untested, wear procedure mask, everybody hopes best. wrong? explain proof way efficient?

The US role seems pretty damn slow me.  one said mask denier. What? really need give shit every body? Eff people stop trying tell folks feel. subreddit r/covid19 subreddit would actual intellectual discussion this. 

You don’t link single publication I’m supposed believe you. want help educate Americans subject (which believe scientists build PR campaign combat misinformation) 
But don’t go platform Americans actually use. Reddit mostly full Left wing white Indian folks search internet research 

That’s Calling bogus claim. condolences you. granddad, 86, great health gut cancer surfaced September, fever intoxication. admitted hospital right away, they've said pneumonia, mild he's JUUUUST FINE. take look ass, gave enema discharged night. cancer. mid-November could try cure not-cancer longer, hemoglobin went 38 despite ferrous solution IV drip. course, would go - tumor first dibs everything...

So anyway, another hospital went, got tumor excised, began road recovery, got covid recuperating, transferred isolated Covid facility passed almost 2 weeks later. 8th day, he's started great medics told us discharging home, still sick, next day transferred ICU. oxygen mask, trach, shock, circulatory localization, death hypoxia.

In last call we've had, transferred, trying cheer up, he's happy could go home - grandma's told prohibits dying. next days, we've heard voice hotline tell us temperature (which bullshit, post-op patient can't 36.6C time) blood pressure. We've jumping phone call new number, two weeks ago, one came ICU doctor, hour we've last contacted hotline got usual. offered condolences it. wish zoom call, way reach ICU all, get record straight. hurts think could've thinking he's letting us down. bowl 100 M&amp;M's, 2 m&amp;ms kill you, going eat bowl? held rallies without masks. Thoughts prayers. $2 day, rather year think? Every year work provides flu shots. Grab time slot online really miss work. I'm really hoping they'll able thing covid vaccine. higher transmission would place additional pressure

And lot, transmission goes exponential growth. European red tape hard comply with, insanely slow. I’ve dealt EU applications...fuck that. 

It’s ways going faster something national level. work woman got it, spent time hospital long term effects. day mentioned husband still thinks it’s hoax. wanted ask meant soon ex husband, bit tongue. Ha worries. Yeah annoying sometimes! vaccine made tried tested technology -- weakened version actual SARS-CoV-2 virus -- one pick provide longest-lasting immunity. mRNA vaccines US 95% effective, may need repeated every year. 79% Sinopharm great single shot lasts lifetime. Atlanta Falcons? parent 6 kids, wonder things myself. think stages, teachers get immunized spring, schools might stay open longer. adults get immunized, summer, kids school maybe summer camp open, different lifestyle. fall, maybe vaccine trial 12 older done, school hopefully open normally, young kids won’t get vaccinated cases low, back normal. hospitals play big part, starting mission vaccinate every single medical worker every person age 60+ relative med worker, also clinics going pretty fast organized vaccinating. here.

I want show life fucking me

Seems average people's measurements success want break world Apparently another month so. There's difference someone knowingly goes unprotected sex strangers, sharing needles, telling people aids myth follow example. point reaping sow. vaccine companies saying supplies bottlenecked government. Trump swing influence get things moving. That's point Anyone Illinois (I’m Chicago area) know plan? I’m trying find haven’t successful. I’m trying get Novavax trials help part get it. worried be? Oh fuck, restaraunt!?!?!? like high risk place!!?! Jesus. Good question! Yes still wear mask vaccinated. Unless vaccine 100% effective there's always chance catch community spread rampant now. also know current vaccines used provide what's called sterilizing immunity, means body cannot infected virus came contact it. chance vaccinated person still get virus get sick pass someone else. Masks easy effective safe guard really spread control. see younger people hospitals around April.

Probably still huge number, though. mortality rate 0.003% 0-19 0.02% 20-49, [per 39 people hospitalized every 1 approximate hospitalization rates 0.12% 0-19 0.8% 20-49.

Now let's assume April 200,000 new cases per day, everyone 20-49. pretty extreme case. new cases per day today. Assume people hospitalized 2 week, way longer true average. puts us something like (2.8 million cases/2 weeks)x(0.8% hospitalizations/case) = 23,000 hospitalizations related covid total given day.

There currently [120,000 hospitalized 10x estimate April scenario.

Once elderly vaccinated, hospitalization rates going plummet.

As final note: none say covid threat young. know enough long-term effects, personally going take risks. trying say (relatively) young never going hospitalized huge numbers seeing today population overall. scientific evidence, I'll change opinion matter.

Show science he's actually helped people we're it. Oh no, 2500 innocent Americans dead. That’s bad. /s It’s time admit irresponsible media being. report hell every adverse reaction vaccine (10 million) none caused single death. Shit like makes people want take it. It’s like want Covid stay always something report on. sensor boomer? proven safe. passed phase 1 2. Wtf talking about?

Idk mean regular products?

J&amp;J started second study two dose regimen rather starting give people two doses rolling study. fine run multiple studies, can't combine data, Astrazeneca already done dosing regimens. Downvote want! Wont change facts. Staying home isn’t perfect need slow spread. Fair, think examples, constitute rare circumstances. yes definitely depend initiated. Four minutes downtime four minutes downtime, matter afterwards.

I guess point make sure people take away CPR actually useless, fast response times bystanders essential, want people avoid it.

My point give up. life insurance companies make living taking hard look cases standard insurance companies automatically screen out. think term might looking ""impaired risk specialist"". Good. I'm disgusted know something like even existed. prime sources hospitalization goes 65+ crowd death rate also collapse younger crowd get better treatment since there’s much strain.

That's magical thinking. death rate go down, 'collapse'. similar observed summer early fall. us know someone killed thing time over.

I get things open back up, wise. tell think. point make sense pause covid vaccine check going on? certainly want rush vaccine everybody without understanding risks, simply people want get drink bar. Germany reported 1129 covid deaths today, that's like 4400 US deaths. point let anti-maskers die. Damn. Thanks update. Yes, I'm saying easy stage going fast. going harder prioritize people based health conditions, easy emailing everyone works particular facility practice. New Zealand little international travel it, realistic achieve country like UK, loads people travel Covid probably present late 2019 Health Ministry reported 152,000 people (roughly 1.7 percent country population) vaccinated yesterday, December 29th. high pace assumed continue long vaccines arrive timely thing perfect victim.

Huh that's interesting. husband get smallpox vaccine going South Korea (among vaccines) said risk still possible contract disease problem there, vaccinate everyone it. Belgium actually tries count ""excess"" deaths.

An IFR obtained dividing official confirmed deaths every case inferred sampling artificially low. Thank doing, begin imagine awful is. Doctors, nurses others field dealing level trauma akin war. 

I think there's fine line disparaging guy death making point death preventable. *my* perspective, deaths made example of, change behavior one individual save lives. 

We differing opinions here, I've enjoyed respectful exchange opinions. 3 months long time doses. Could still reach normalcy reasonable timeline even that? numbers ramp up. yes, challenge great.

Simple math: 300m vaccinations 10m per week take 30 weeks.

Right stop targeted ""healthcare workers only"" stage. slowing process down. There's zero excuse ~10m delivered vaccines sitting storage. Get arms! (That helps healthcare workers too!)

Yes prioritize getting vaccines distributed healthcare workers... vaccinating everyone else, instead of! Wait, actually think Trump involved planning?  probabaly getting reports, it. seem worthy news here. feel family, also can't care member political party created chearled humanitarian disaster falling victim it. 330,000+ American lives saddened losing. Wait EU already approved Netherlands started vaccinations yet? complaining! Archived copy: ""Doesn't matter misleading, still big number!"" No, like approach, fucking cretin. many logistics experts here. love it. shouldn’t compare New Zealand, actually. New Zealand tenth population density, island. Controlling covid NZ walk park compared anywhere else think read 95% figure somewhere else, can't source atm. Glad see final hurdle passed UK (and shortly approved India others). important mass vaccinations worldwide.

The U.S. unfortunately taking anytime soon...trial data expected late Jan, we'll likely waiting March FDA approves. 

Maybe we'll figure give couple shots day. /s First all: thanks providing source 👌

Secondly: quote provided isn’t efficacy shot statistical goal posts able say trial truths I'm worried might trilogy:

2020
2021: 2020 2
2022: 2020 Even US much bigger order British Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine American MRNA vaccines, prohibitive cost storage issues MRNA vaccines.  Except California, recorded crazy number 66,000 Look forward sharing disprove me. I’m homework. Clearly though research shows right, added nonsense bogus qualifier hopes would make right.

Ill repeat though it’s fun: Europe current epicenter crisis. also passed North America total cases. find extremely hard believe they're already 100% manufacturing effort. Hopefully someone looks since haven’t seen research around issue. Stuff like permanent lung scaring cardiovascular issues doubt we’d see vaccine since require virus replicate levels would prevent. Stuff like chronic fatigue though possibly immune responses well could exist people even vaccination. Something something analogies aren’t always perfect think central point conveyed. Hmm sure that. know sub little top, everyone imagine you’re right. People still stuck terrified “this never end” mindset, thanks media. it’s clear threat diminished, people start move on. won’t everyone first, may slow, happen.  Yeah, definitely better false negative. see realistic solution in-person events. added roughly $10 cost per person there's 20% false positive rate. Could show sources numbers please? Including percentage positivity rate show much spread undetected? Homie, already mean focus people risk they’re likely end hospital. hospital admissions deaths go things allowed open gradually. sad. Always Mary Ann fan. teacher, let tell going continue:

Nurses quit labeled cowards lazy, left managing new normal staffing filled lowering standards rather increasing employment.

That's rarely reported teacher shortage. short teachers increase class sizes. Soon nursing shortage nurse responsible increase.  Places like NYC even denser, yet matched Israels pace yet. excuse incompetence. *Again*. long since reopened? Four weeks?   this...New York City, NEW YORK CITY ALONE, vaccinated people combined polio entire country currently Coronavirus NEARLY FULL FUCKING CENTURY AGO.

In 2.5 weeks? Get real.

Maybe drunk-posting. see drinking problem seem pretty unhinged and, well, stupid. short medium term, likely.

This virus, fortunately, mutates much slowly influenza viruses do, already got much lower chance significant enough mutations escape vaccine immunity (no mutation thus far done so).

On top that, 50% vaccinated we'd see *significant* drop transmission rates, fewer chances mutations. 

In long term, sure, we'll see significant mutations, especially human-animal-human transmission. That's get different coronaviruses. fortunately, success mRNA vaccines huge future vaccine development - much faster next time get new vaccine. always favorite. Whenever go shopping wife asks ""Do want ginger?"" always say ""No, Mary Ann"".
RIP wearing eight hours day? that’s it’s miserable. workers home like, oh what’s big deal put mask walk dog. Meanwhile essential workers sweating faces ten hour shifts.  Purchased yes, delivered no. [I'm specifically referring last summer's potential deal administration could've locked ***more*** 100 million doses passed instead, orders could've delivered earlier (if deal summer passed on) deadline orders fulfilled latest June 2021 (as link says).

I find info links delivery deadlines Oxford J&amp;J vaccine, can't comment that. It’s going depend success vaccinating would say overwhelming majority population, 70 85 percent. that, mid end summer, think get fall, October, November, times like that, think close degree normality.

Technically untested dosing regimen, downside. given everything everyone knows, experts seem believe there's like 99.99% chance it'll work well better 12 weeks instead 3 weeks second shot. not, it'll slightly less effective, sounds like. still original acceptal range 50% effective. Well, super cautious nature think says 'very close degree normality' means mean fully normal.  None, comment country vaccinated people far, ordering enough vaccinations said country's entire population first place wait summer 2021 enough vaccines entire population. massive population compared countries, exactly passing Pfizer's offer summer order extra vaccines disappointing me, since means going take even longer orders delivered there's entire world trying acquire well. realize original comment sarcastic sure downvoted think important remember FDA originally said they'd approve covid vaccine 50% effective. Even 50% effective, big role play stopping pandemic, that's even considering possible effect preventing severe disease. current flu shots 40-60% effective comparison see that?

We botched this. richest country world put rest 6 months ago, said US worse much industrialized world.

In fact notable within North American EU, countries top 10 GDP (US, UK, France, Germany, Italy) amongst highest deaths per million reported, except Germany. fact US middle pack list. Ignoring US, rich countries well funded public health care systems strong central governments.

UK delaying second shot 12 weeks seems like good idea since could atleast get people form protection short period time. Although curious downside delaying second shot several weeks? Thank Republican near you.


""It gone Easter. Democrats new hoax"" - Donald Trump average resting range 55 85 you''re good Obviously extreme examples like that, it’s okay cease relationships  ...and Trump GOP trick ""real"" Christians thinking Trump GOP ""God's work""? unbelievable. They've tricked mother, heartbreaking vast majority people far likely lives ruined lockdown effects dying covid point Fair enough guess talking known issues discussed. doubt more. People realize things open doesn’t mean go, right? you’re comfortable going, don’t. local hospitals aren’t overwhelmed, people acting according personal comfort level shouldn’t bother you. Yesterday read interview expert said real number several times larger 2 million, reporting lagging far behind impossible know exact number. 

I'll try find article, think might NPR. I'd imagine living poor conditions, certainly poorer hygiene, exposed much varied degree pathogens, immune system becomes pretty effective tackling things thrown it. reminds farmers know pretty much never ill, even though they're exposed worst bugs (from soil, animals, animal excrement etc). although Corona also novel virus homeless people, immune system pumped, effective overreact (cytokine storms often part route mortality). Couple virus spreading anywhere near well outside homeless people outdoors time, getting better Vitamin ambient light, less testing anyway, makes sense me. exact boat Every euopean country did. guess thats mean say together Yep. wife warning kids shit hit fan day they'd close schools. already done large grocery run would tide us weeks. March 13 came everything shut ""for weeks"" told kids expect back school fall earliest. told wife needed start preparing mentally year this, best case scenario would containing thing summer, even likely stretch. I'd feel vindicated half extended family still seem think joke. I'll never see way, they'll never see us way again. think we're idiots, know they're idiots extraordinarily selfish boot. Concerned? go! isn't, especially center Israel Healthcare infrastructure lacking due (imo) spending settlements giving Haredim money political gain. ""The personnel deployed facility Dec. 23, tested routine testing next day."" 


For fucks sake...nobody thought test sent nursing home??  agree misleading cite number doses we've agreed purchase. distribution administration US painfully slow. think it’s getting infected UK studies participants test every week. Precisely. look purchasing daydream. Say shitty day work need distraction. Tossing couple bucks lottery ticket easy way get mind bad day, daydream would won. Sure, perhaps problems still you’ve lost, every brief mental vacation worth couple bucks. Man would literally first line could get vaccinated now. Curious want vaccine especially works healthcare? Unfortunately US going approve April. last year university basically stolen covid. easy classes lined could enjoy it, never happened. wish married person stable WFH job time wouldn’t feel like I’m missing much. top somehow find job this. No. Literally values monstrous. know world wasn’t binary? CRAZY thought know.

It’s almost like normal, rational person, reasonable see things instead blindly laying blame every step way like little petulant crybaby. Berserk undead come running you, smart enough make way barricades escape it’s use. They’re everywhere! Every day worse 9/11

Never forget today..yesterday...the day before...last week etc Getting people killed make buck Christian thing do. happens federally coordinated plan. ""let states handle it"" approach failure since day 1. US build atomic bomb fight world war two fronts matter years - federally coordinated plan. USA vaccines distributed 4th best per capita rates vaccinating. talking about? never argued excess deaths 25-44 range due COVID. 

Comparing countries America apples oranges, imo. Americans place heavy importance values “freedom” individual liberty. think you’re vastly overestimating ability many American public follow rules. Also, really don’t many lockdowns country following initial months rules regarding covid protocols spotty state. Eg live Illinois one state there’s mask mandate all. 

Your personal anecdotes literally illustrate point. governments gave structural support people places. structural failure highest magnitude. 94%OF COVID DEATHS UNDERLYING CONDITIONS

Fuck mean ask any? case know...
You're 94% lot. Lmao sub...... Possible, 5 died later various reasons. Mostly elaborating “branches every damned medical thing bullshit mixed in”. better hope Jansen gets good readout/signal really soon. true. recently discussed sides liberals many areas. really care lol. vaccine prevent prevents severe case covid, thing Anecdotal, two British friends living Leeds. elderly. told would rather get Oxford vaccine think tested enough older populations issues trials. take whatever vaccine offered them, elderly scared.

I think blindly trusting authority great virtue think is. universal. part strategy also factor antibody testing? Presumably someone already contribute reaching herd immunity taking vaccine? mention none trials involved people already antibodies, might good idea check regardless. 

Also complicating everything there's still possibility re-infection, several confirmed cases. I'd imagine would potential narrow window achieve herd immunity.  Ya know... great subreddit FAQ may able help alleviate concerns! :D saying never again? Looks like it’s you. According CDC best estimates:

0-19 years 0.003% chance Maybe? think almost 9x many deaths ""comparable"". analysis risk looks worst case scenario incredibly flawed, though. Hopefully get approved January Good question. know. guess need super trained person give injection, think giving injection might part basic first aid training many already received? 

I'm also thinking wisdom retail locations like Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, Costco mass vaccinations, would likely result large lines places.

FWIW, total national guard numbers ~450k. Idk arguing here. government spend money train nurses? That's probably true. need funding CCs increase capacity train nurses. Idk ""business"" comes that.

If arguing costs much nurse, 1. cheaper CCs. 2. That's like broader question US education system. selective ruthless cutting underperforming students keeping cost students low like Europe? think so. would also pay higher taxes. I'm willing pay higher taxes help pay free colleges many Americans somehow believe raise taxes ultra rich keeping middle class income intact providing additional services, make sense mathematically. Drive thru vaccines cannot safely that.

Yes can. drive through, give card time vaccinated go park parking lot monitored nurse walks around checking vehicles. 

This already used county California ([relevant screenshot California vaccination strategy webinar anti-American remarks. many reasons angry America, criticism off-base.  Live SoCal.

There places give rats ass fully support that. Police going anything happily take fine keep doors open.

Just drive around Downtown literally anywhere find sitdown resturant, ones benches tent tables outside.

If places going get help, blame keeping doors open. fair. Holy fuck what's going UK? 981 deaths far. That's equivalent almost 5000 US. can’t “too poor” healthcare, worst aren’t poor enough qualify free healthcare don’t job provides good insurance keep vials frozen, 30 days pfizer vaccine. vial good 5? hours thawed. 

Still lots timing involved things happening corona town. desirable aspects city life gone. odds low, doctors. Notice mention medical professional cared say? Sometimes expression ""One death tragedy, one million deaths statistic"" holds true. get mailings local casino they're also throwing huge bash. play game ""normal"" year. Fuck going pandemic. 

I'll gamble responsible manner. Putting various wines paper bag grabbing random one enjoy relax bubblebath mystery book. sub also removes word ""p l c l"", seems pretty ridiculous me. Yes sneaky exponential spread limited testing gave false hope. comparison fully valid.

Lottery chances age-independent. chance whether 20 65 years old.

Covid-19 age condition dependent, low risk 20 high risk 65.  literally got numbers link posted. every one trial tested per week, period time, non symptomatic cases cough well, guy radio morning trial, participant's health workers higher risk infection Floating isn’t swimming. That's absolutely insane. would take spot line heartbeat. exactly April AstraZeneca vaccine. Prediction Chief Operation Warp Speed. April. US shit ton people infected (india)and even close friends ...they families....are going party holiday season. masks, precautions nothing. dad doctor know situation hospitals. uncle mine three people apartment building died covid, two friends lost dads one dudes dad barely recovered. like, virus exist happens immediate family. 

I never felt embarrassed entire fking species past months. deserve fking get wiped meteor something. Advanced civilization ass. 90% humanity monkeys role playing dumbasses. rest 10% also monkeys lack power influence people use brains. Masks important ever even vaccine like said. never large crowds ever again? Get lol people still drive home getting vaccine doctor metadrama please!  climate change? AHHAHA get fuck Looking forward real government. case, blame lies whatever nations government poor response. 

The usa government countless failures containing, mitigating effects helping citizens businesses. _That_ damnble misery all.

That, people either pass 8th grade science (noses hanging masks) just. Don't. Listen. 2,252 7 day average using NYTimes data. dropped 2,607 Dec 24th due Christmas holidays. See California's governor proof concept. I've said before; even people sub, almost uniformly concerned COVID general population(excluding trolls), start losing patience COVID restrictions, that's efficacy lockdown. People seen lives gone shit cause lockdown, willing take chances COVID means get back normal think so? Many people aren’t. Many long term effects organ damage. way get sick another person. 

We don’t know yet easy case, though know worst outcomes, don’t know long term effects.

It’s silly discussion. Funny everyone notices reality radically deviates pipe dreams. I've seen many articles mild expected side effects effects fatigue, headache, etc record, didn’t downvote suggest one aforementioned numpties.  possible!? Crazy. Especially speed getting administered. want turn discussion 'vaccine vs vaccine' ultimately worthless without information, yes know way Oxford vaccine trials set up, wanted 'catch' asymptomatic COVID cases.

The trial participants returning nasal swabs regular periods find asymptomatic cases.

The main thing however large % take vaccinations nationwide/and worldwide, secondly keep using masks/social distancing vast majority population vaccinated. transmission factor matter less getting vulnerable groups vaccinated first.  Twitter, Facebook, ... British variant arrived. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* WAT. RIP! Holy Crap! Mary Ann! hurt brain. ;) covid immunization speed equivalent processing times brains government dipshits running warp speed. Oh ffs.

The UK Pfizer protocol requires administered way treat patients adverse reactions.

Drive thru vaccines cannot safely that.

The entire United States like goddam Florida world. 1979 Steve Martin gave answer rhetorical question:   Ah didn’t know. That’s bad. Thanks. Also ""bowl hundred mm&amp;s"" bullshit completely invalid analogy. 30 year-old literally higher chance struck lightning dying covid. I'm sure everyone agrees European Commission, i.e. bureaucrats EU responsible vaccine procurement, total failure.

But AZ also sucks balls. run n different trials n+1 different rules, go cherry picking results, like ""oh, hai, take half dose first, much better"", current ""bro, real trick wait months shots"", ""we're right everyone else"" bullshit. erodes confidence, makes wonder findings even statistically significant. Never said didn’t want it. Don’t know I’m downvoted seems quite likely people working healthcare sacrificed lot year, even take unnecessary risks. understand you’re upset, time, expect? Rewards? Praise? 

I told someone else thing “When done, one going go congratulate you, torturing means nothing” 

It’s harsh truth. That’s media shouldn’t made issue morality you’re “good” stayed home “bad” fuck all. People care immediate families (that like). That’s What's efficacy? sequence every sample, sequence random sample positive tests. Thats basic epidemiology 101. That's British variant discovered, sequence every sample.   It’s unpractical don’t know people would faint behind wheel, etc... disagree. would much worse position without lockdowns. It’s foolish give vaccines sight. Here's opportunity Drive-in movie theaters... Movie shot special. mean, state national guards even capacity this? hundreds/thousands people capable giving vaccinations sitting around ready deployed already engaged necessary healthcare work civilian lives? absolutely shameful badly US fucked every aspect response pandemic; glacial pace inoculations recent example. I'm beyond frustrated potentially life-saving vaccine sitting unused hospital around block me. , work dead. anyone delivery dates and/or production capacities different vaccines. UK population covered? wife Teacher, 2 kids. believe things said public comments time School Board meetings regarding School opening person, virtual, hybrid.

It's tough parents, particularly single parents, feel bad kids, lack consideration School staff, complete ignorance classrooms like today kids packed them, people completely uninformed Covid-19 risks. many people saying ""kids can't spread it,"" ""they can't get sick it."" "" CDC lying."" Taking comorbidity rates context, could go on. many saying aweful things School staff legitimate safety concerns. Clueless. quit Yeah people don’t follow rules certainly choose believe money make anyone accept level shit abuse. don’t think that’s so. don’t think average nurse making that, traveling nurses specialize ICU ER work always demand always expensive. average nurse making 50-75k. similar salary Europe get treated like they’re causing virus spreading. Well teachers one category makes sense include get 65s so. kids disgusting cough etc don’t worry.

Other though, people need still maintain distance months life start become normal reality disease dangerous double threat: vulnerable elderly, straining healthcare capacity. Otherwise, average healthy person, it’s bad, could somehow isolation take healthcare resources spread others (which can’t don’t fucking downplay it!) 

When vulnerable elderly vaccinated, hospitals freed thing quickly fade. Saying word ""roundup"" vaccine together right. Thanks. 

Yeah, I’m posses buff around neck, drinking beer...so Even though wanted say something didn’t know drunk sick wearing it. I'm currently watching brand new outbreak real time 0 local cases 100, within week, (Sydney, Australia) live updates confirmed venues spread occurred. avoiding lockdown moment aggressive contact tracing. visited venues supposed get tested self isolate result comes back.

I guarantee restaurants bars, remainder churches, grocery stores, nail/ hair salons. link current list genuinely interested. I'm sure getting research restaurants factor literally seen happening eyes real time week. Say ain't Would antibody test tell got vaccine? Newsom workers set parking lot, helping people fill advanced directive forms DNR requests. What’s EU supposed AZ doesn’t supply sufficient data? tier 4 can't come soon enough. Boris floated around date April 5th today, would nice day target man, it'll year lockdown (on off). No, previously go 14 day quarantine wanna go back high school absolutely combine data, regulatory bodies generally data science illiterate don’t accept data showing anything one variable ata time (safety, efficacy, etc) pos website, unreadable mobile amount pop ups. web become. Per article, move ages decades, age distribution really matter. work every state. fast vaccination program depends clear simple-to-execute plan. hospital contain cold storage necessary?  larger systems area prioritized? live AL, finally made lose hope vaccines rolled ... ~30% acceptance rate among HCW hospital surrounding ones. Abysmal. 

We people oppose masking, oppose restrictions, etc etc etc, they're *freely handed* way end pandemic, want either? point crossed options, process elimination decided want death, plain simple. 

I've decided that, husband finished vaccinations, everyone else area opportunity get one, pandemic me. vax fails get sick, die. spread someone well-researched Facebook get vaccinated .... care anymore. I've following rules year, sake others, watch everyone else selfish make stupid justifications it. Nono wrong. that's useless. got notification stage 3 trial area Novavax today 1918 flu strain seemed lot cytokine storm (basically, killed immune system...) deaths. portion Covid-induced cytokine storms there, lead factor like 1918, far know.  

\*I medical professional, take layperson's explanation cytokine storm grain salt.

\*\* ""Boosting immune system"" thing buy scams thinking protect Rona.  know cytokine storms obsessive reading immunity due naturally ""boosted"" immune system...Enbrel thing standing completely janked spine. Canada wasn’t first approve vaccine, UK already approved week earlier. would need UK *and* Canada approve could? sake optics? enough evidence make claim leaning either way Setting treatment areas easy, getting qualified staff hard, spring New York New Jersey benefited getting staff help state, one knows cases might surge reluctant send staff. military possibly help right solely civilian “Upgrade knowledge online” lol Honestly think people know one they're getting, everyone getting jabbed sameish time multiple vaccines approved used, go vaccine NHS, get come back later. 

I'm sure they're looking double dosing people well (think AZ / Sputnik combo) they're going tho, although I'm sure they'll look sorts. covid two weeks legs weak...anyone experience Ireland counting numbers whole Southern Ireland differently? normally northern Ireland never south. So? 80 year olds WV chronic lower respiratory disease still dying covid 10x rate 70 year olds dying 10x rate 60 year olds. Either way still makes sense start oldest methodically work way down. Let save time... Go back test samples October. Florida beginning 65+ January 4th

Edit say could county specific  honestly know capacity that. definitely complex something I'm underqualified on. appreciate folks trying figure out. Smaller churches operate transparent finances non profits owe much (at least income tax) they'd able expense income. Property tax different story though. “Can get hallelujah!?”

*donation noises* Bro, read state report. number tests actually pretty low 100% agree AZ hasn’t even sent proper data EMA. last package deemed insufficient approval. don’t know what’s going them... US method seems political. It’s disgusting. Young police officers fireman don’t need elderly, wtf. church Phoenix similar thing, Church nations decided Im good church Yeah, know keeps ""crowning"" so-called experts. Everyone acts like Bill Gates doctorate medicine. knows shinola medicine! absurd. that's true, let's get asap. United Stats needs hurry up. totally expected even reported media gonna feed misinformation Someone re-post headline January 1st everyone lose shit! You’re fine, relax We're lot better countries; UK, instance, much worse state us. Northern Ireland, many restrictions, far new cases day us moment, 40% population. I'd call successful, personally. anyone sees Wales could please point direction get latest updates? 
The iOS news England matter what. Part expiration date longer regular milk. started buying organic cut trips grocery. Even doctors notes issue. tones doctors mind little unethical get money. require doctors note specifies doctor treated condition 3 months ago (and punishable fraud doctor lies) avoid people doctor shopping. Ok, firstly, hate anyone. Life's short. yes, operation warp speed funded number companies race covid vaccine. long way ""Trump presided over..."" helpful contribution, sure, I'm grateful US government so, part funding went development vaccines. personally presided lack covid mitigation efforts US. want get real picky it, OWS nothing first vaccine hit finish line. stop talking yourself, getting sad.  hill want die on? 

Not saying I'm favor this, think Florida needs evaluate battles need fought. stuff gone there, even top 10 mess ups. Changing going matter 4 months now. 

I'm saying upset; I'm saying lose focus real issues are. According require testing end self isolation, lot people continue shed dead virus fragments bodies, trigger positive test, infectious long meet CDC's criterias, routine precautions fine. mom ain't deep. AYOOOO death 82 likely natural causes What’s bizarre small scale see too. went small church hill outside town 20,000 people. maybe total 100 regulars consistent 50-75 every Sunday morning. then, town mega churches nicer property “downtown” areas, despite big town. hundreds couple thousand congregations. tell distinct difference attitudes. church sorts Good Samaritan things give back local community Never make papers. weren’t that. wasn’t about. image garner people. humbling giving less fortunate. glamour. face time media. It’s front larger churches gain much attendance possible rake extra money. original WuHan strain die off? people don’t exist. figures come from? Pfizer $40 Moderna $15. Imperial come later vaccine expected cost $2. 

Regarding cold chain, developing countries Latin America handling fine millions doses. Pfizer-BioNTech provide special cases carry vaccine in. every mRNA vaccine stored -70 degrees C. reckon India needs Pfizer Moderna well, high effectiveness alternative option Canadians returning countries vaccinations begun. said, doubt enforce this. Pretty obvious it’s everywhere. ad executives thought young Gen Xers would find cool early 90s, us thought missed mark mile. Honestly, let go get sick.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yah. 2.5 million people vaccinated US received initial shot. still go second shot. “If praise God, protect us virus”

*100 people die

“No one know God’s plan”  brush family members die, either. Domestic violence poverty definitely issues effect children addressed. use abusive parents reason nobody protected safe global, deadly pandemic. Schools supposed day care centers stop parents beating them. school stands way child physically abused, quite apparent services need implemented help children. Florida knocked state. it’s shotgun kind deal.  may stop transmission somewhat, degree untested.

I mean, know stops one sense. don’t get hospitalized, meaning sick less time don’t much symptoms don’t infect doctors nurses patients test clinic centers etc. also lasts shorter contagious less time. may still contagious days week(s), there’s guarantee there.

The issue disease vulnerable elderly hospital capacity. vaccine solves three. Much less people get sick first place (symptoms.) People don’t get hospitalized it’s ever weak thing even fraction get sick. hospitals open up, vulnerable stop dying, becomes like cold. Doomering long covid aside.

So spread drops, meaning naturally dies bit (but endemic occasional flare ups). problem hospitals handle vast majority sane people vaccinated especially vulnerable way. recommend swimming low impact joints less cardio intensive. heavier attempt run going likely encounter joint tendon issues relatively quickly. Swimming, Cross Country Skiing, Rowing (ERG) three forms cardio I'd advise anyone attempting lose weight safely work fitness. This. changes goal posts constantly. wants make money vaccine and, thus, would love every man, woman, child took it. That's he's making recommendations. Anyone thinks he's altruistic deluding themselves. idea downvoted De colores Strange - work hospital accepting COVID positive patients, Administration side things - typically patient facing - CDC actually reached via hospital email inform turn get scheduled. Hopefully girlfriend gets ASAP!!! mean, *very* pretty. don’t think it’s soon say that. Yeah hang on, accurate? I've told around 1/3 people covid asymptomatic would mean huge change pzifer data no? matter break gets tested - really sick people always get tested, tests potentially prioritized - matter many test sites open, regardless holidays, thousand sick people testing positive.

The channels (drive thru, optional testing, etc.) ones watch - % positivity exists pool. know it’s bad (11% already awful), probably much worse 11, 22% probably completely comparable. Particularly awful here, middle age, ""second act"" career business selling medical garments ill elderly people fashionable helped people keep dignity. Yesterday CA 35k new positive cases Covid. cases new variant isn’t going make one difference. mutation CA quite time one reasons cases high. Sad. main cast Gilligan’s Island still alive? paper work pretty easy. templates. tell computer vaccine prints paperwork minute typing. Hit print, fill questionnaire, sign bottom, good go. Due ACA US, vaccines pretty much universally $0 copay. good tech get paperwork done fast rate. gave 15 flu shots one hour back October(my personal record). usual prescription processing. time consuming all. Screwing together needle dose takes like 10 seconds. Sterilize area like 10 seconds. Get gauze bandaid crash go, 20 seconds. actual shot, like 15 seconds. Sharps disposal takes like 5 seconds. Activate safety catch needle, throw sharps container. put bandaid on. Boom, done. 

It's like like minute two most. There's something wrong you. Seek help. opinion, way hotter Ginger. Sad see passed. worth German Federal Health Minister said pretty bluntly still giving initial vaccine shots 2022. That's slow process is, Germany half size Texas. rest report horrible ones. /S 

I hate titles like could ambiguous. I'll take antlers, please... like water i’m imagining hypothetical scenario: it’s deep. I’m seriously wait “single rider line” clinic means could vaccinated dose isn’t wasted It’s interesting bring up. Supposedly one local hospitals considering distributing unit secretaries custodial staff physicians, reasoning individuals likely engage behaviors would spread COVID, poor use PPE. physicians obviously upset, particularly anesthesia get airways. would seem physician individuals would likely catch patient care difficult replace got sick, purely epidemiological standpoint, almost makes sense vaccinate hospital workers lower SES first truly slow spread. Something chew on. thought interesting. It’s already happened. story today Disney exec bragging Facebook family member got jump line. think happened LA. knew would happen country who’s real culture money power. Next thing media trying explain sports personalities need vaccine “sports good soul America really need distraction”. randomly getting unlucky = ""we're going get virus"" alarmist 😂 realize virus cripples far people kills, yes? see fed apples lunch.

My family could never eat apples, due supply limitations, country can't overcome much larger population. That’s part it. biggest issue it’s done hospital setting, equipped distribute vaccines effectively. gets rolled community health settings, hopefully go faster. need turn injections factory production line. Getting million doses arms every day joke. 15 minute wait reaction one biggest issues. Yeah might allergic vaccine ehm hope God let stay 15 mins check get allergic reaction.

Then I'm USA good around this, isnt tend essential worker jobs greater percentages wfh? contact non house hold members. also mexican family members abide rules. mainland Chinese forbidden also? mean spend 10 minutes filling form CVS calls telling don’t it? People also seem forget medical professionals also fighting ongoing pandemic addition vaccinating. It’s logistic nightmare worst possible time live across street CVS. I’ll ask spoilage stock February. Like flying standby. No, readily available supply anyway first order due while, prioritised az instead, I'm sure turn moderna PURE COMMUNIST DRIVEL !!!1! select people trust, control,” said public health expert works regularly China CDC, declining identified fear retribution. “Military teams others working hard this, whether gets published depends outcome.”

It’s AP impeding scientific investigations here. though? Old people chronically sick burden economy anyways let die. good republican impression? xD lot Latinos/Hispanics work front line, nurses, supermarkets etc. EU even started analysis yet fucking Anglophobe ""most likely also possibly basically not?"" fuck saying dude. National guard could give injections. See easy would fix this? name Verruca chance? Ah old Southwest pick seat strategy. get plane loaded faster. Honestly, Moderna, even sell vaccine U.S. government. 

The U.S. government people deserve it. 

I say American. commute, saving gas money, car upkeep, time, etc, probably already saving people working home 5% (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ dont know anyone cared ""PR bullshit"" know people needed paycheck. dont give enough credit workers see PR. dont feel like heroes, happy still make money millions others work waiting eviction. WFH might incentive people you’d put work earlier pandemic boss wouldn’t care productivity today. less PR issue UK, UK government consistently said following science, NHS become much national icon nobody dares challenge it.

A good number UK government, including Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, already covid although official line still vaccinated practice lesser risk otherwise. UK constitution (or whatever without written constitution) allows Prime Minister fired Parliament almost time feel like it, fact changed Prime Ministers beginning run major wars. certain amount chaos Boris went hospital covid, losing Prime Minister crisis game-changer.

The UK Prime Minister playing global sheriff like US President, really big decisions (such happens come nuclear attack) made well head time distributed commanders advance (in case nuclear attack, sealed envelopes captains nuclear deterrent subs). read Costco administering vaccines general public well. Wild times afoot lol That's true actually. unplanned baby. well done. win argument. idea kind funny. dead corpse hurling city wall. Ah yes clearly hypocrite made statement society cannot individually afford rework society personal wealth. revealed deception. Cars good actually system built around totally compatible climate survival. far know evidence masks prevent infection reduce infection severity wearer. could helped (probably) people \*around\* people worn masks. Maybe that's meant. Oh look favorite CCP representative! Thanks giving us unfiltered view Chinese government wants us see!!! office given us two weeks decide, time employees make 100k+ Production bottleneck right now. Getting people’s arms is. saying she’s first “patient” fair enough

There's still practical difference though. places refer clinical trial subjects ""patients,"" though could mistaken confusing myself.

All feed people's fears. Trumpeting first ""patient"" taking approved vaccine made sound, still makes sound, like tested given people. That's literally people circle say reading article, clarify every time.  Considering extremely strong safety rules have, would say extra new entertainment keeping people home watching tv, net positive effect. do! Sadly religion makes exempt rules. Here’s hoping Biden revokes 1st amendment nearly impossible current Supreme Court. lead data collected April result released necessarily. ""covered"" ""on off"" switch. 

The data phase 3 trials showed ~53% ~80% efficacy 12-13 days receiving first shot. Efficacy increases 95% one week receiving second dose. I’m U.K. first wave, unit (barely noticeable) staff cases covid. time around, many staff close admissions two weeks don’t enough staff. wear masks visors work unless eating. Patients getting too. literally dozens scientific articles Lancet well CDCs estimates IFR. Idk LA can't imagine much different Texas. I'm part mexican married Mexican family. 

The latino population trust government expect help them. trust general community groupthink unless comes directly trusted people social circle. build intensely strong cliques family units which, along distrust general society, makes hard outside information get in. telling social distance going cut say ""oh sure social distance, need babysit sister's kids grandma needs come help clean cousin birthday really tough year come through"" lot time type educate outside family unit seen oddity really listened to, maybe made fun acting white sometimes even get pushed family circle different. 

The reason masking social distancing nobody (at least TX) run kind intensive campaign capable permeating cliques. perspective, potential threatening source asking give valued support system knows long. top generally poor health part caused distrust keeping many doctors offices, remotely surprise virus affecting significantly. Trump said 30 million vaccinations end year. People promise want. Biden fails goal you’ll shrug say president hard. ""Retail workers"" lol still get high school math stuff percentages. shame. worn damn mask, maybe could’ve prevented. “The power destroy planet insignificant compared power COVID-19.” anything sell 🇬🇧 oxford vaccine debatable efficacy country enough Moderna Pfizer vaccinate vulnerable population time soon.

I really see UK specific thing. fact Chinese thirsty vaccines due well-controlled epidemic ......

If great appetite vaccines China, 2 million doses exported Indonesia Brazil would scorned general public, didn't, neither anyone around ......

If need it, get it, need it, need it. China 1.4 billion people, less 10 local cases every day ...... need hurry get vaccinated? Yeah, worst healthcare worker without affiliation hospital. can’t get vaccinated since don’t connection local hospital. emailed public health department told us email local hospitals see could spare doses us. emailed state congressman said call hospitals ask help. husband sees 40 patients day. positivity rate 15% area. didn’t close many offices closed. saw covid patients. losing sleep this. trying find hospital vaccinate husband holding back doses staff. downvoted people want give bacon order prevent future pandemics, feel offended even dared raise topic...this f*cking world. Well, glad agree. Appyling many protective methods possible indeed way go. Hence, limiting everybodies movement closing schools non-essential shops, less infected people spread. I’m also open solutions people situation like mine. Americans days average commute around 20 miles. Ah PB shot. walking though line getting injected bunch shit taking needle right ass. Good times.  UK’s top 3 age groups covid children. Difficult say it’s gotten worse new strain, price pay keeping schools open. Covid completely control though. dont think mentioned trump once, funny seem standing country actual facts offends also associate trump evil . say you? yikes know laughing didn't. least they're trying. gotta start somewhere ""edgy"" out-reach. applaud success worked hard SACRIFICED for. Lies. Wisconsin doses would fine.  Agreed. It’s CT. think we’re ok spot communication due New England governors working together. Well that's luxury afford people might view selfish. people can't see parents this. people forced make living environments 100% safe. ""selfish"" shame people want semblance normalcy options limited can't afford see loved ones years. written AI???? word choice bizarre. Vitamin C doesnt make invulnerable anything Lmao keep sucking trumps dick. administration would done this. pfizer vaccine developed without funds warp speed. Garbage admin u cant get enough apparently. Little soft head Oh OK, what's difference?

Before participants clinical trial designed evaluate effectiveness safety vaccine either got placebo vaccine. 

Now they’re patients getting vaccine administered medical staff order protect control virus.

There people incorrectly declaring first “person” get vaccine, plain wrong reasons said, saying she’s first “patient” fair enough. 

There always many trials medication approved commercially produced medication - it’s completely different stage development. It’s historically unusual trumpet first patients get vaccine approved produced widespread use. feds already bought billion doses. already know months ago? least 70% People remote inland town two cases entire 2020 still wear masks know needs see this, expect keep hearing people saying normalcy back March April. Please, please understand trap they're setting. They're trying get enough people's hopes make look like official information even though not. Then, March April passes, people gonna accuse public officials moving goalposts. Please fall this. usually wait give smallpox anthrax vaccine go deployment. least that’s in. Domestic reassurances moderna vaccine approved UK ? I’m open discuss changing won’t shame people require it. Like said earlier, want change still participating society lol. Yup. would take would one asymptomatic employee eating around others. even sure allow people go take breaks outside. Yeah thinking national guard already handling testing areas - drive-thru testing site went run national guard (incredibly efficiently well, matter), surprised end participating vaccinations well they're going general population. I'm confused hospital needs gift shop? curiosity, see adverse reactions received vaccine? think 2nd option, vaccinate vulnerable first, without administering second dose, get 1 dose asap He’s full shit. live Los Angeles 99 percent people wearing masks. Ah well see simple rational: thing exists society depends it, need keep discuss changing all. That's coal fire power plants good guess. immoral. Doctors already gave doses expire random civilians. Twitter wasn’t demanded blood jobs. even sent local news person home publicly shame live TV. you’d expect refused answer door offer public apology hurt caused Instagram. wonder switching model would good bad. would take advantage production rampup probably spread load damn, lot people can't fucked remember something month later, let alone two. fear start giving regular people like lot would forget come back dose 2 B-b-but AMERICA BAD = free upvotes 2 regular doses 4 12 weeks apart - AZ press release Thats good point.

My frame reference processes described tests injections happening parking lot adjacent hospital, case, could runners replenishing vaccines inside facility.

You’re right, would harder non-medical facilities would also likely need perform vaccine distribution. People tested negative landing still turn positive 14 days, without tough control incoming passengers always risk wasted effort. way apply many protective methods possible They're probably withholding information post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Pretty NSFW lol I’m sorry, forgot news network originally downplayed virus called nothing flu...but know fuck everyone else right? idea federal govt anything nothing short ridiculous. really luck much difference pathology epidemiology two. EMA said wont approve oxford vaccine 'months""

What bureaucratic fucking mess. growing hotspot needs I’m Florida, I’d look infectious spread droplets think. 1/1000 Americans already died. number accelerates 1/500. 

But “true patriots”...smfh happening Albania mid late November. 3 weeks we're seeing lower number new cases tests done fewer people coming hospital treatment. 

Source - im covid ward doc public lied republicans though. Yes, public shares blame thinking critically republicans bear lion’s share responsibility. Wtf... shockingly stupid, take one phone call even case would work.


And know know deal try getting unemployment phone see works frankly dumb idea tell group known meme disdain toward older people (""Okay b*mr""), mostly kills older people.

It dumb idea accurately report facts know them? Plus israel problem involve military organize things would illegal quite lot countries. Project Warp Speed what's failing. vaccine developed without PWS. China's cases suddenly stop? rest world get control, *no way* time, 80k cases. call bullshit, there's billion people there. say, do, eh? Sorry aboot Jimmy found way make money without Juggies.

&amp;#x200B;

Im sure still fond memories juggies. distribution problem. vaccine on-site. understand fluid. That's I'm angry about. Reduced protection everyone one dose better waiting. drive r0. Maybe people allowed socialize anymore Yeah sure. think that's problem leaving distribution states. seem pretty important haha

Pretty sure Pfizer Moderna studies tested patients symptomatic trial. would think would tried contact trace participants positive could part study. May also data many confounding variables make conclusion point. study participant positive may controlled way determine level certainty contact traced positive spread vaccinated individual. mean, would possible may scope study. 

The good news millions vaccinated individuals large numbers able break noise surrounding question would think. vaccine even clinical trials therefore extremely unlikely (ie impossible) get released time sufficient doses vaccines. 

It's never gonna released isn’t, official trial data shows 62%. data effective ‘dosing Non, absolutely say needed 10 years trials made publicly available.

Im saying needs months trials know tue long term side effects. 

Im saying technology never released a. public medicine millions people. 

There nothing wrong pointing risks out. 

Except subreddit, whwre yoh get voted suspended anti vaxxer mods essential worker health insurance can't get unemployment phone even trying 6 hours day, makes probably 15% do:

Because LA ain't place overwhelmed ICUs. pessimism towards initial vaccine rollout arguably slow truly warranted? expecting first weeks vaccine rollout bit slower expected begins scale up? safe assume scale up; it? COVID-19 (or accurately, SARS-CoV-2) SARS-CoV-1 variant. two different viruses coronavirus family. Covid back May got vaccinated last week. also tested antibodies back May, also have. difference receiving first vaccine dose subjective fevers/chills fatigue day after. I’d recommend getting vaccinated opportunity. Yes, math illuminates... vaccinating 1 million people per week, would take WAY less 20 years vaccinate everyone... lol. Also, obviously get efficient vaccinate 1 million per week, math WAY off. vaccinating 200,000 per day. NEVER RAMPS (which will), would vaccinate 100% country 4.5 years. get herd immunity well (especially account people already sick antibodies slow prevent spread), current vaccination levels would done virus less 1/5 time projected math. again, unrealistic worse-case scenario.

Remember, someone wrote internet, mean true. earlier version SARS MERS hit West hard? Check comment history. He’s sarcastic. Ok makes perfect sense. hasn’t discovered weaponized it’s extremely unlikely smallpox virus weaponize. there’s still small chance, military region vaccinated would target. it’s unlikely citizens travelers vaccinated. military abundance caution Sadly, worst video post-truth era. dramatic saying article obese people's feelings. no, possible obsese people get normal weight. incredibly hard maintain weight lost. like saying heroin addicts quit. can, still impossible most. saying obesity exactly like heroin addiction, proven hard overcome even people want overcome ernest. reference skin color also say skin color exactly like obesity, statemate might sound like biggot would say reading like article people color.

That's Wales, Murdoch lives England, can't imagine much different. [Particularly since coverage vaccination suggest skipped aged 80 second tier priority groups vaccine, along frontline health social care workers. first priority residents care homes carers.

Got it. soo cute everyone virtue signal towards healthcare workers here, us essential workers make like 15% Health insurance safety nets whatsoever almost equally dangerous situations, wait far longer vaccines, completely forgotten about.



But yes, nurses Incredible health insurance making $100,000 year sure need send Pizza/money/etc! never Covid symptomatic tested positive, I've something similar kept running 4+ months now. Went ER felt like heart attack cutting grass. Since I've seen cardiologist. suspect pericarditis.

You’d land, quarantine 2 weeks hotel, go trip. really, covid hospitalizations way, way higher flu hospitalizations don’t experience long flu similar rates covid.  also vaccine flu, even though 100% effective enough reduce attack vector every year. might want compare hospitalizations covid versus flu absolute numbers age demographic. anything like flu.

Maybe they've actually research enforcing masks public transportation see effect. knows. thx Ah good ol Reddit, tell someone go kill get upvotes. think lack saying things plainly problem culture. Rather, think tribalism point-scoring political ""opponents"" main problem. 

Lifelong best friend mine 100% onboard antimask/antilockdown/flu/hoax train. honest he's 40yrs old, educated, higher engineering job. lives Georgia wants find way drive appear Trump rallies Republican Senate stuff put message, ""we beat people game"".  

I learned early amount cases, deaths, tragedy ever change mind hoax him. point, simply engage football talk. gets ""Trump clearly election"" stuff ""the flu"", remove completely. Region locked article :( Dr Fauci never worked regulator. Experts actually worked regulators say MHRA gold standard, 

Moreover, Dr Fauci retract statement Oops, maybe it’s actually 3 100

Its LOT less 3 100, unless pretty age otherwise unhealthy. Yeah, understand. calm saw neighbor beating dog. know, there's art ambassador cause. Knowing say say win influence people. us would better leaving talking leaders.

But bit holier thou attitude may dozen reasons people trouble giving meat. can't shoot straight explanation confirms biases. think vegans -- often still young time hands -- understand parent working 45+ hours week amount time ""fight"" them. may living denial dozen levels tough break though.

Yes, know complicated. saying **more** complicated can't place work identify people vaccinate. **more** complicated say anyone diabetes, CHF, COPD, etc. get vaccinated. need somehow validate eligibility people signing appointment slots easy saying ""anyone working X hospital eligible"". state accept medicaid expansion? state offer low cost free insurance program exchange long term consequences extremely rare healthy young adults. death minimized, don’t need keep taking shit economy. People die economy suffers, too. There’s old statistic one percentage point increase unemployment rate leads 37,000 deaths average. vaccine? problem Austin - technically bars closed, get around charging $6 bag chips beer, technically they're restaurant. bars/restaurants supposed distance, enforced. 

We better most, numbers lower rest Texas spiked, better-but-still-not-great meant bought us little time. numbers started seriously spike - hospital admissions Covid rose 63% one week, we're 34 available ICU beds 11 county area kind hard blame doubters. media hyped 3-5 different diseases (bird flu, swine flu, SARS spring mind) since 2000, none major impact West.

To degree blame hysteria-inducing news pieces casually lots folks treated (and cases continue treat) COVID-19. felt like another case crying wolf ad revenue right quarantined. Indeed. Much along there. Hope get readout asap. congrats AZ. Us poor people, coincidentally essential workers one cares about, can't afford save money Nobody (or least people) buy lottery ticket expectation winning anything couple bucks scratch off. Nobody buys Powerball ticket think they're hitting jackpot. Things getting really crazy Ireland right - new strain going bring society knees. data unfortunately bad feared. whole country 600 ICU beds. understand linking death numbers saying “lol like flu” horribly misleading?

Do understand you’re spreading bullshit? threat parents family members, much them. cares right? Teenagers, guess, zero empathy. Please don’t confuse “stupid” “edgy.” saw Biden planning activate response plan could make describe possible — can’t recall was, national guard similar. hope happens.🤞🏼 sort online voting every country based countries provided vaccine first good acceptance %age. see point providing US vaccines first people still protesting wearing masks Costco’s hold Christmas parties? point data bad regardless run statistical model not. information regarding whether covid samples sequenced randomly sampled population covid cases state specific area. amount sequenced, would randomly sampled give remote chance data use proper analysis, even then, maybe 7 samples major metro area, plus scattered around state, enough draw conclusions. order get good account transmission trees virus' variants spreading, need sample cases different geographical regions different socio-economic status' within regions. point, would need sequence thousands cases month get handle moving. I've seen multiple doctors TV say vaccines work new strains, one worries. think whole operation start running much, much better around end January.  posted evidence theory correct. maybe novavax April- May lucky round . toddler got 4 shots last month. Got cartoon bandaids cookie fine. Vasovagal reflex. Nah, really. Democrats say protesting BLM spread covid. Rather, said protesting BLM worth so. still recommended masks distancing rallies. Personally though, still think people it. so, least distance wear masks. yes it’s happened many times before. that’s security measures Go learn difference evidence human human transmission vs human human transmission Union Gap Washington State. Southeast Seattle. I'm playing numbers percentages push biases. I'm using data represent something clear, simply, 55 years old, chances very, high die covid. can't argue statistic. that's even including pre-existing condition, would lower chances even more. thing deadly age 55 according CDC. statistics even include asymptomatic get tested, would reduce death rate even more.

You're absolutely right fates worse death. idea fate person ""recovered"" covid could have. 

But regardless that. fact people dying this. care 1 persone died this, want give 2nd person would die it. like see bad covid statistics, clearly good covid statistics use advantage order beat this. Well, that's UN next actual power. fundamentally symbolic organization built high-minded rhetoric empty gestures. Sorry thought corona Washington. still want know people get 73 million ppl won’t take it... think time goes people take it, follow suit

edit: moreover, “73 million” people won’t take it, vaccines go someone else like i. And, take us many months reach 73 million vaccinations talk one thing time. least can. hold one thought head time? Even managed get enough economic aid people survive 9 months on, doesn’t account massive resistance lockdown length would face. didn’t lockdown 3 months without widespread resistance, 9 month lockdown would even unenforceable. Atleast dance routine tik tok Yeah, course there’s uncertainty, that’s I’m confident Biden, listen experts say it’s necessary. life maybe, commissions aren’t Term aren’t extravagant. idea you’d take life insurance payout invest pull enough gains every year replace loved one’s income (less taxes inflation) without touching goose laying golden eggs. confidently need 10-12x planned disbursement. It’s rocket science exploitation, term life insurance super cheap (again, assuming don’t disqualifying condition). Im Nuke still school bad here. leave didn’t get approved still decent liberty radius eh. Ive since September know got everyone including staff stuck base. exactly!! like yes ofc id hope vaccine works new spike protein mutations, im trying ""doomer"", anyone done real research theoretical point? something ""we reason believe work""? Blame rigid protocols. can't use vaccines normal people everyone high-risk group vaccinated, can't find last people high-risk group, vaccines get wasted. nutjob keeps posting 'US equivalent' numbers? Buddy, reporting root cause lol. 


This country needs better. fact whole vaccine distribution scheme seems like put together bunch interns inspire confidence country’s competence. Bringing large group un-vaccinated people together indoors seems like bad idea. …they math.

I remember back March April replaying someone would mean around 2,000,000 deaths *at least* US US take mitigation measures.

""BS! get 2,000,000 dead from? That's ridiculous!""

If, back March, assumed R₀ around 2.5, means would need around 60% 70% population contract virus, 1% people died, US would facing around 2,000,000 deaths tried herd immunity strategy. Assuming worked, hospitals overwhelmed, etc. etc.

Based numbers provided.

Using 98.3%, R₀ 2.5, number climbs around 3.5 million. That's nothing. Never mind long term health effects.

I guess need ignore harder! 5G! Microchips! La lalalalala can't hear you! disease would like see weaponized? 😂😂 comrade!!!! Finally, good fucking ~~food~~ news. think states California New York don’t resources knowledge vaccinate population? EU sanction arresting officer judge. nice lady clearly doesn’t belong jail, she’s mentally ducked up. Please send money provide visa able seek treatment west.

Exactly. honorable lady welcomed heroine west pay people stay home. Problem solved. Even open small businesses, good chunk society choose go. top that, people getting sick/dying permanently removed economy.

The ship sailed avoiding economic hardship this, opportunity available uncontrolled spread happened due lack planning federal level. three options:

1. Open everything up. Many people refuse participate economy, die, permanently removing them. Lots hardship.

2. Close everything provide assistance. People begin riot lose homes, businesses, etc. Societal order starts break down.

3. Print money limp pandemic. value dollar erodes bit inflation might go bit. get pandemic mostly good shape though, economy comes roaring almost immediately back.

Of three options, number 3 one control most, least economic pain involved. Unfortunately, current administration chosen stupidest option all: plan. We've ended combination options 1 (things opening/closing almost random, depending state) 3 (single round stimulus wear out). healthy 41 year old US congressman died virus mods wont allow discussion major news goes agenda. pathetic. Odd, felt anything myself. got я хорошо себя чувствую still live families cannot live guilt possibly getting family sick. sister plays club volleyball pisses end earth since team 13 people constantly hang one another maskless “team bonding” worst part pandemic. Sometimes come close losing rationality want drive hold hours wave guilt crashes right back Assuming every excess death would Covid death, isn’t case, likely still wouldn’t drive mortality rate 1%. least I'm one thinking cautious. Depends happened whether vaccine directly responsible. tend base decisions opinions facts evidence presented me. I'm adverse changing mind something that's mean? It’s probably regional. previous lab 18 people. qualified get vaccine. 5 did. rest refused it. 

At current lab, half us willing get it. rest refuse it. awhile get it, though.

This TN. know, feel sane Gary Busey expectations. Eh let God sort em US, it’s based much money have, worse imo, Financial advisors recommend level getting commissioned sale life insurance. death lottery around you. Think 7x high end. really though, there's ethical alternatives Yeah. WFH ""new normal"" thing want long run. Everything else sucks I'd rather stay home work, avoid commute. again, one sociable coworkers (not anti-social extremely introverted, rather extensive social life friends already need it), one relies coworkers socializing. going happen without federal action, considering current federal policy COVID ""murder many Americans possible,"" simply going happen. 

This vaccine deployment needlessly slow wasteful ensure maximum death parts Canada exactly that.

You’re right technically could gotten kid, trip grocery store, wherever, hosting events working staff, interns, volunteers carry campaign without following even basic precautions like wearing masks that’s pretty risky choice. And, can’t definitively say contracted it, also can’t look possible contraction incident separately ignore probability relationship greater context decisions.  know schools closed! cherry-picking theory suits preconception, dude.

The vaccines pretty innovative inject inactive version virus like traditional vaccines. Simplified, give particular protein body figures create antibodies target protein.

The protein chose one makes coronavirus deadly. virus mutates, either keep protein (and deadly vaccine effective) lose protein probably nearly deadly.

How many vaccines one person deliver 15 minutes? 3 maybe? time sterilize area, give jab, dispose sharps, etc.

So straight away need 20,000 people administering vaccines. 30,000 work 8 hour shift, 12.

How many people one person monitor time? get nurse give flu jabs work, keep first aider standby, that's like 30 people... Let's exclude nurse (busy giving shots) say one person monitors 30 people time. That's extra 2,000 people.

Who paperwork? crowd control? staff admin?

Wouldn't surprise US needed rustle extra 100,000 qualified people make work, maybe several times that.

**Example**: One town 500 total people. 10 murdered. That's 0.02 murder rate. Another town 5,000 people. 25 people murdered. That's 0.005 murder rate. town 25 murders safer town 10. instead two different towns, imagine two different times.

Translated US numbers, would 172 000 cases 1080 deaths per day.

However, due technicalities death reporting done, looking reported deaths day-to-day basis say much. see trend, instead recommend shows number confirmed deaths day, numbers predicted rise due lag reporting. sound flippant know hospitals gift shops. Somebody supposedly charge promised more, much much more.

I’m glad got live long did. saw five great grandkids missed two born. daughter great grandma 13 years, pretty cool.

I'd much rather Singapore HK right states people think two options opening everything eternal lockdown. Cool thanks! exactly.

And yea, see family outdoors, hugs close contact, mask on, 6 feet apart, etc. personal choice. wouldn’t get vaccine members family assume safe science isn’t say couldn’t carrier

But you. honestly don’t care do, lol. I’m informing that, since made point say boyfriend can’t see “until February” getting vaccine protecting you, him. want. ... ~~battling~~ denying ... right wrong human human transmission. stating fact, time evidence human human transmission. People forget health authority, political forum health authorities share data insights. know participant countries know share. wrong many things, health authorities providing information sharing. non, confused.

It’s hilarious doubling specifically asked publicly available medicines vacinnes.

I literally quoted said: name 1 nRNA vaccine using Covid technology cannot . none.

You didn’t mention publicly available first asked don’t blame would led absurd position. started talking testing trials safety. whole thing trials short - make commercial availability would back ridiculous position saying “No mRNA vaccine made commercially available unless mRNA vaccine already commercially available.”

This exactly kind ridiculous mess purveyors misinformation lead into. won’t get better you!

Up mRNA vaccines considered commercially viable high costs producing, storing administering them, due fact (cheaper) types vaccines available, concerns don’t apply Covid-19 Governments world guaranteed customers regardless cost. commercial considerations completely irrelevant originally claimed concern supposedly safety. fact mRNA vaccines used humans many many times, proved safe efficacious. fact considered expensive neither there.  Yeah, fuck it. [There working EU can't exactly shake AZ data falls out, especially messed Phase 3. current vaccines approved emergency use. Licensing follow next year. analysis?

Remember fear mongering headlines control spread covid, like 250k deaths US?

But course limited actual production distribution vaccine ramp quickly enough Production numbers estimated Pfizer alone 100 million doses press releases late September. Moderna similarly scaled back production estimates year came close acknowledged collective difficulties scaling production.  realize population area stays same? 10 000 people possibly exposed disease, test 10 found 1 positive, might mean actually 1 000 positives walking around spreading disease. actuality course shows testing inadequete track disease. Positivity rate 22% show eather resources test anyone without clear symptoms 22% population actually Covid. course latter would extremely obvious. testing limited asymptomatic/presymptomatic keep spreading disease, know isolate.

See also: significant number Chinese people think credibility shot one bud, take timeout try later Oof. terrible hill die on. Japan dropped fleas infected bubonic plague China WW2. Another important update press release: first dose prioritized at-risk groups, second dose still given within 12 weeks: 

*Throughout global pandemic always guided latest scientific advice. studied evidence Pfizer/BioNTech Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccines, JCVI advised priority give many people at-risk groups first dose, rather providing required two doses short time possible.*

*Everyone still receive second dose within 12 weeks first. second dose completes course important longer term protection.* Jab jab jab haven’t excited since invented super gonorrhoea. Definitely will. Expect Oxford J&amp;J apply EUA US sometime January hopefully approval late January/early February (assuming good results, think fair assumption) J&amp;J particularly exciting extremely easy handle requires one shot. Ironically, one nation trust weaponize diseases, US ""non-profit"" hospitals surprisingly money hungry. may investors, often executives getting paid millions, writing bonus checks, working remotely vacation homes front line staff like residents getting denied sufficient sick time getting paid less minimum wage. hospitals put billboards thanking healthcare heros. 

They always benevolent. something legal, mean right. wasnt. US German agreement US pre authorizing billions germany using part technology almost 100% american version moderna operation warp speed. dont see alot countries there. surely glad everyone else paying doses like dont pay defence russia china. yes US bad guy world. sad. death row? not, let out. 

Just you’re imprisoned doesn’t mean neglected According this, 48hrs less incubation time symptoms occurs 2% patients.

My understanding incubation time infectivity fractionally less incubation time symptoms, meaning significantly 2%.. populace cooperate lockdowns significant effect. raised vaccination rates recommended - obligatory - vaccines low.

It recommended threshold measles recommended threshold others. look data, compliance 90% range.

Lower rather low, would Flu vaccines also recommended working age people France. ask it’s always would want followed attempt talk it.

I agree that. look data flu vaccines, little good unless risk group (or work risk groups). France following science here.

For chickenpox agree. followed French recommended vaccination program kids got it. One minor noticeable scarring result. vegans Navy radioactive? became batman? human cull, many asshole monkeys.

""i mention outside reddit"" congrats nothing anything. referring US mentioned specific vaccine approval mad called hypocritical US therefore wanted make sure stated opinion EU EU . mentioned one positive factual thing US even US main research center funder every vaccine since 1800. would you. point opposite true even though not. ittl get upvoted reddit hivemind . never said anything supporting trump blatant hypocrisy. associate positive US support facts pro trump hilarious me. love excuse joke go explain wasnt.

Not ""same day"", ""two days later"" ""seven days later"". need test fully 14 days later catch 99% people eventually become symptomatic.  would better prevention look like? genuinely, answer social distancing forever, see little reason alive. weeks spreading misinformation. stop. People still pretending rubbish real vaccine production months, could begun planning months ago. something important start planning going delivered week. start planning months ago, polish plan, add contingencies X happens, plan more. plan hypotheticals, plan trials fail, plan, plan plan more. people who's entire job planning. Thanks explanation, thought sounded odd. assume vaccines becoming approved (such Oxford one UK now) rate vaccinations increase? like we’re catching christmas numbers there’s infective variants spreading weeks don’t think anyone saying complete normalcy March April, however sincerely think you’d incredibly misinformed don’t think significant restriction relaxing time. It’s simple math even vaccine rollout slower hoped, vaccinating 65+ entirely doable time frame would reduce hospitalizations deaths 80%. 
  
Don’t fault people optimistic, especially sub feasts negativity catastrophizing. end clearly sight think you’re incredibly mistaken think see simply trying trap people maybe could’ve prevented  


OK - agree phrasing. key ""maybe"" (which stand scientifically too)

This one best metastudies far.  never said anything government either. literally make things someone said order fit fantasy delusional. said US single biggest contributor corona vaccine vaccines medical treatments world ever known yet reddit factual statement seen literal trump support even fascism praise US trump president. hilariously braindead almost scary people stupid. still talking elections . seriously think joe biden cant speak without prompter save lives? trump isnt good pretending biden going anything even delusional said before. doubt care whether get see data Ill take one. go?

They still candidates phase 3. Despite stupid propaganda move ""approving"" phase 2, people developing actually following normal procedures, might 5 working vaccines within next month. 11 candidates phase 3 according [WHO's really think likely get it, seems unavoidable. Unless live isolated compound needs catered to, going catch it? people live apartments shared common spaces people living near them. would little odd approve vaccine week advance rightfully done so. leak would inevitable it’d bring government, undermine NHS vaccines. believe reports next week referring roll think unchanged. don’t think it’s unusual countries approve something different dates. it’s worth, don’t think EU even got data analyse, wonder they’re behind. God forbid people trying optimistic. must conpiracy. guy didn’t wear masks went rallies everywhere zero social distancing. However wish nothing best family, l hope death Herman Cain make republican party see real virus kill people, even own. course, know won’t they’ll keep ignoring it. essential, public-sector worker California, I've got zero faith state's ability get people vaccinated timely manner. Ah, wondering first person break covid vaccine would be. doofus might them. ton issues right now. First 15 min waiting period injection. Second little bit controversial. allowing first responders get vaccinated means holdup first responder get vaccinated holds entire line. get choose safe, fast priority time. 

Our first responders needs vaccine first. believe get cut line card. Anyone set doctors appointment get vaccine made bruitly clear first responder sets appointment slot get taken them. X amount vaccines left. first responders. implication article people actually unwilling take virus *side effects*? Meaning headache, low fever, etc. day? so, that's wild me.

Or worried possibility *complications*? Meaning long-term/life threatening effects, extremely unlikely thing, least commonly used vaccine, abundantly clear trial data. Herd immunity calculated based partly (or entirely?) R value. need full herd immunity (which results eradication virus) significantly reduce transmission manageable levels. NYC good example. dont full herd immunity, 25-50% range immunity seems helping lot keeping numbers despite population density. Upstate NY much worse NYC right cases pretty close US per capita? Today saw 177k cases. Please, us actually study give rats ass science. Don’t even try pull garbage, /u/nutmeg92. Especially civil. 

We also understand basic human sociology. Expecting society lock distance tiny fraction (people can’t vaccinated) already small group people beyond unrealistic. trying manage expectations.

Awesome, right? Thank much helpful reply. 
If properly understand, Alabama’s latest positivity rate @ 14% basically means snapshot, showing improvement? 
Or, could seen dip anomaly could rise coming days? every major hospital like NYU 20-30 pharmacies. Even half participant one 100 day (8 people hour 12-14 hours day). That's well 600 doses day. Pharmas DEMANDED governments pass laws protecting would release vaccine.

WHY? 

The EU fully underwrites financial issues vaccines behalf pfizer. deal Pfizer demanded EU sign. Pfizer financial exposure. demand never asked bedore?

How know long term effects vaccine developed never used technology tested matter months? understandy Shit, that’s better tetanus one. get tetanus shot bunch volunteer work years ago swear arm felt like useless, hurting lump raw meat nerves two weeks. many people infected person infects. Anything 1 means disease spreading. Anything starts dying out. That’s really kind you, thank you. actually started streaming twitch weeks ago try make online friends, it’s going okay guess. Bit weird talking hours end barely talking 9 months lol Great. First minks, frogs. 2020 end!?  Kind hard explain I'll best. Someone correct I'm wrong.

It's spreads faster (which results easily overwhelmed hospitals- causing countless problems, getting virus/more dying chance vaccination etc). spreads easier. virus higher transmission rate harder stop mitigation efforts, like would difficult avoid infection room someone contagious. easily slips efforts like easily slips population X level immunity less transmissible version, therefore takes higher level immunity reduce transmission levels equivalently.

Say example 50% people immune. say hypothetical virus reproductive number 3 (each person gives 3 others average), another contagious virus reproductive number 6. half population immune going reduce viruses R values level. Say reduces first virus R1 second virus R3. second virus still much capable maneuvering around immune people finding new vectors first virus, easier transmit. 

You end infected therefore immune end pandemic, cost. Way people gotten virus died less contagious/spread less (japan 125million people 5k deaths example). Especially vaccines already rolling I'm fan Florida's aggressively head-in-the-sand approach things, pretty clearly kind anomaly/artifact: preceding five days much lower positivity rates mid-teens. Which, clear, still high. I’ve regular colds honestly. fact winters usually start getting cold December leaves sniffling way spring. 

Really glad haven’t gotten one year, likely thanks wearing mask. cages lab need apart ... Oh wait immune system first recognize proteins/antigens introduced vaccine, takes week generate new immune cells (specialized B cells) able produce antibodies target protein/antigen! Im health care far haven’t met anyone get issues vaccine. elderly folks got hot flashes nothing didn’t experience things. far good I’m hoping puts end pandemic puts families home belong exactly. Without vaccination person X% chance infected going normal life. would depend number things like gender, age, health, behavior, location... Getting vaccinated reduces X 95% average. know nurse works Florida said hospital tests severely ill Covid patients. don’t test it, won’t find it! Live music start 2022, it?

Also watched NextStrain every single day first three four months pandemic finally stopped look like mutating particularly interesting threatening way. this, great. Give virus millions millions factories work months eventually get innovation! Yeah isnt second one one fucking everybody What’s fucking goal here? Lockdowns five years? know dozens med students would willing administer vaccine. also looked countries roll outs. least transparent best better organized. seen large vaccination centers Germany. RKI website contains detailed plan. Even though numbers also great moment (about 60,000 vs. Canada 40,000 vaccinated today), seem ducks pretty lined up. issue government. taken care global pandemic.

 crowded area puts co workers risk.

I mean would want go places? spreading fake news weren’t patients. participants clinical trial. per Trevor Bedford. would conclude 501Y.V viruses currently rare US they're circulating responsible recent surges. Geographic sampling Dec makes conclusions US difficult, data California (LA particular) highly informative. It’s like keep quarantining new strain coming every year new vaccine doesn’t work? Even takes 5 hears? hypothetical question SJWs thoughs prayers pastor's surviving kin. know. Trial participants continue monitored figure out. Probably year absolute minimum, hopefully longer. really wondering what, anything, change terms measures.

Currently, known cure Bell's palsy; however, recovery usually begins 2 weeks 6 months onset symptoms. 

In Jean Chretiens case child. source? Bet would saying thing 2%

Staying inside advanced technology keep occupied hard. keeps spreading cos many people go see friends. what’s R0? post referring said lost job first lockdown. took mean hasn’t gotten job since. That’s Jared said. EXTREMELY misleading best. worse, bad logic using lock state down. Mass hospital testing relatively new (which fine infection control strategy). problem -- using data patient tests positive, even hospital acquired COVID case relatively insignificant, calculate ""metric"" (that nothing capacity).

If going something like 100% (not 100% Newsom math) transparent it. don’t know. NYU hospital 600 tests day one location. could many vaccines easily.

The CVS doesn’t room wait. won’t nearly many. gotta tough remain professional throughout this. Stay within yourself, control control. best, can't save world world trying kill itself. ones save live never forget help.

Just best. thank you. nothing - amount extra effort governors put would still least mildly moderately helpful, part they're still not. Yeah, I'm saying problems. I'm saying sucked watch almost year ago REALLY sucks now. absurd slow motion train wreck many levels. virus makes rules. Fail control cripple economy healthcare many people die. No, one said personally, make hobby keeping Fox Newsers closet personal group people.

But exist internet, know ""living fear"" dialogue plagued us rational people since April. getting stat from? confirmed cases deaths John’s Hopkins (all countries), infection fatality rate 2%. probably bias countries testing mostly symptomatic people (meaning many asymptomatic cases going unreported).

Even take second assume 1% people die, whole country infected point, USA that’s 3 million dead. won’t get anywhere near 100% infection (herd immunity), number lower still correct order magnitude.

But that’s all, virus continues spread, continue mutate. continues mutate, possibility vaccine’s effectiveness diminished significantly even strain effective current vaccines. 

There course possibility mutations make less deadly. mutations increase replication favored (natural selection) even possibility mutations good make virus less deadly, even virulent. 

So much unknown could happen go back normal.

The bottom line “new virus” (one resistant previously gained immunity, including recovered infections vaccines) appears, closer back starting point finish line. Yes  aware every state required submit distribution plan early fall? Nothing get done federal level January 20th. tragedy inauguration day comes two biggest holidays year (Thanksgiving &amp; Christmas) January February going worst months record COVID. Eventually, that, vaccinations start getting rolled regular schedule, fall 2021 we'll hopefully better shape overall.

But yeah, anyway, Trump sociopath committed genocide people United States. world, he'd tried sent prison remainder life, unfortunately 70 million people vote anyone R name, even proven uncaring fascist authoritarian let country burn spite them, so...yeah. are. ""It is."" knows better that. knows Trump isn’t approving vaccine. knows hundreds doctors scientists CDC FDA make decisions. say that? score cheap political points knew covid Trump’s biggest weakness. 

It political strategy, scummy eroded public health. knew exactly doing. say supporter hers. believe states even injected half they've supplied, supply help bring vaccination numbers up. disagree? think Lin Manuel Miranda get another shot?  last sentence something routinely gets forgotten discussions. means they've given school something less dangerous flu. Apparently rather sacrificing children we've decided sacrifice us. Right? can't imagine came home school online learning April May, suffered missing summer vacation, maybe started plan college life groaning strain isolation.... catch fall quickly end. sad. sure legit though.

Any tips this? I've using cloth/surgical entire time far. I'm food service time switch. people say “living fear” utilizing delivery service? Seems taking prudent precautions. course young people die it. rare still makes headlines. Must American thing variant CO discovered, would wait see else @trvrb say. Looks like finds denominator possible stance changes calm things think. vigilant spreads easily give vaccines time work.

The previous variant, D614G, became dominant variant around September 2020 so. But, again, vaccines start slow virus. Also looking new variant, hopefully quarantine better. reduced hours equals people positive versus people negative. Explain logic works out. see argument case numbers leaped people couldn’t get tested suddenly could, order logic hold, somehow, bunch people would normally come back negative decided get tested. Cool. Toss SMU beauties see work. less attractive would follow, like bad wine good. speaking someone grandparent pass away literally yesterday, it’s fucking infuriating people like act flippantly loss life like that. 

that’s incredibly self centered selfish view have. global pandemic

*just flu bro* varient likely caused spikes US, Colorado went max day 1000 consistently hitting 5k+ Yes data shows effective draconian lockdown was, going 4% positive rate Wuhan, 0.4% positive rest Hubei, 0.017% positive outside Hubei. That's handle virus remains control west. doesn't. means know current numbers. guess forgot /s?

Come on, nobody plays pin tail iron lung - many iron lungs left. 

All people complaining work take notice - there's money made selling anti vaxxers.

What business makes iron lungs built essential oil diffusers? Slap tablet give users ability post anti vax Facebook groups little Jimmy going better thanks healing crystals oils. Jimmy need polio vaccine.

Artisanal iron lungs, small batch handcrafted children's coffins. Nobody gives flying fuck stay home order. empower states also don’t give flying fuck go say “seE LoCKdOWnS dOnT wOrK” good job government. copy/paste accident? thinking didn’t sound familiar! here. math it. do. showed rate would take like 20 years vaccinate everyone. got downvoted double digits it. One guy wrote personally ask ""what fuck wrong you?""

It's math. use illuminate things, really. That's all. country many beds available enough specialists. nurses regular doctors takes months teach treat intubated/soon die patients Yes. Prisoners must watched times officers work shifts. patients handcuffed bed way officers sit outside doors. officers masks, full face shields gowns. want world change significantly become sustainable equitable rather returning COVID-19

What loaded question, might well ask people want things ""be better"". course people like vague concepts, try asking people give next flights/vacation neither sustainable equitable get others - well guess answer would probably split people don't. New Frontiers. mean March kinda baseless asspull start personally I'm really surprised Sometimes, truth pretty. they're divas anymore, they're superstars Los Angeles County ICU beds capacity. hospitals offering extra $2k per shift incentive get nurses staff turnover high places. That's true! Texas here....mind swap single day records bit? ICUs full. Imagine child grandchild coming years covid far rearview like ""huh feel good, think flu. Strangest thing though, can't taste anything...""  Yep, would totally take first dose. disagreeing Could response masks distancing? Something akin bacteria becoming resistant anti-biotics overuse said products? can't imagine going through, writing gives vivid picture. hope continue write experience important times remembered. writing made cry. Well, yeah. old normal led mess. world change better. Drastic positive change goal. happen? time tell. aiming exactly things used pre-pandemic extremely short-sighted. maybe bushmeat, wetmarkets, mink farms bad China US Pfizer Moderna issues scaling production mRNA vaccines. lot practice producing older protein vaccines shouldn’t issues production wise approved. I’m sure they’ll work mean time 10 times number vaccines available now. Oh man, unaware that. think appropriate hourly wage new grad? 5 yrs experience? 10 yrs? Look data Bureau Labor Statistics Midwestern, Southern, rural states. making 75k/yr, even close. neighbors, too. Several nights row last weekend. Well

Fuck hell “significant change” mean? Anything washing hands often routine lockdowns could considered significant change. news like please spend health care last saw, see 30% return investment. sorry demographic replacement New normal coming soon tm California population 40 million people. find city less 100,000 people state, need scroll number 75 [Wikipedia populated cities.

New York State population 19 million - little less half California has. 20.5 million less people bit easier manage.

That’s 1% that’s hundred positives walking around instead one guy. see people comments stating work, surely way people industries assist healthcare workers temporarily get thing control. I'm saying work bartender surgery, must way utilize wasted manpower. really understand “survival rate” drops rapidly significantly CANT GET BED HOSPITAL FULL? 

You people fucking stupid selfish. cannot let cure worse disease also need systemic institution-level changes. Discovered September, sure global now. Thank testing started roll out. people needed know, knew.

When available you, know. know yet, means available you.

Our governor mentioned back March April obscuring testing locations limited want people showing testing facility doors (yet) know 20 Lunch cars great that's get infected even doctors nurses Seriously. go thru randoms facebook everyday. wear mask, I'm sick. 

It's you. people spreading dont realize sick. Either asymptomatic presymptomatic. 

I another person saying asymptomatic people spreading it. 

So said, well that's even worse. First true, means country filled biggest self centered people actually hacking lungs, going public? Like that's good all. drastic measures actually try? remember hearing lot “we don’t need lockdowns, we’re China” “we’re California” delivered shitty, mocking tone elected leaders places like Alabama Mississippi. didn’t seem ever take seriously enough. wonder 40% positivity rate. know one got today, know 10 total! one saying present. simply seem dominant strain existing surge LA. greater transmissibility makes easier certain strains spread many cases, several intermingling factors affect strain dominance. ""wannabe"" princess, said likes act like 14 year old girl. Hence princess analogy. grown ass man, common knowledge, acts like petulent brat. Thank president Trump! know 3 today! I’m back line vaccination I’m excited get one soon can. Thanks answer don’t get it, intended sarcasm? least part paid stay home complete nonsense imho. Nobody would willingly stay home get paid nickels dimes real job, that’s ludicrous.  Americans allowed Mexico, Turkey Brazil. story 2020? You’re right people look anecdotes like assume it’s big deal. people heads sand can’t think critically - much really. 

I hear “99% survival rate” time, people know too. Yeah cool I’m friends multiple nurses doctors told they’ve never seen anything like this. ICU nurses 6 patients normally 2. Multiple patients dying, one other. Running vents. Turning entire floors covid floors. Tents parking lot refrigerator trucks back. Unheard situations. 99% it’s still far worse flu, probably “comparable” virus we’re used see regularly. virus swamping health system way flu hasn’t lifetimes, way NOTHING lifetimes. We’re lucky it’s 98-99% survivable worse worse already we’d fucked wouldn’t know (I don’t know true stat barely matters bc know virus really like don’t need people try justify anything saying it’s “only” whatever % deadly). morons keep insisting young people cant die Freedom precious freedom...to spread virus nightmarish broken. system. state ""regulated"" dumpster fire.

That sounds like US coronavirus strategy general. Sounds good man can't even imagine pain, tiredness, helplessness, desperation doctors, nurses, medics others behind ""badge locked doors"" general public sees courage, strength, hope, skill, fortitude dedication. you.

Known unseen, even though behind doors. Tonight, seen. heard. matter. care.

From internet stranger reads needs - big hug, much love big thanks. problem scale this. yes, doable still 2-3 mins attention frome someone. preaching family. 

Extended family taking turns Costco run every 1.5 months

Avoid going store person. 

Every store curbside pickup. Walmart/Target/Grocery stores (Kroger’s/Aldi/Safeway).

Use Amazon Fresh/Whole Foods/ Instacart. 

Also hope Intubation video played TV ad. way they've treated people lost jobs March/early April able get new one, yeah, see people eventually losing shit. rate becoming starve death go work risk getting COVID. one things really irritates me. Hospitals giving half doses have, theory need give half people four weeks later.

This sounds like gross mismanagement me. plan vaccine four weeks. I'm saying reserve vaccine eventual supply chain problems, 50%, maybe something like 25%.

Here's numbers. vaccination one dose followed one dose 28 days later. Lets say 10 million doses, month make 10 million doses. saving half vaccinating 5 million people. 28 days later, finish vaccinations, vaccinate 5 million people, 28 days later, finish last 5 million second shots.

If hold 50% back have:
5 Million vaccinated 28 days, 10 million (total) vaccinated 56th day.

If reserve none 
10 million vaccinated 28th day.

You vaccinated twice many people half time amount doses. think work need people really see impact way polio. Polio fucking scary. infected kids mostly asymptomatic, even get really sick die hospital. friends see misery way kid partially paralyzed polio. word San Diego - 2% outbreaks (not cases, that’s 3+ cases location) “Gym/Fitness”.  listen bullshit Except adopted goals simply minimizing deaths. Thats arrived guidelines. Hence entire basis criticism. listening all? bars open supporters love Corona mutates slowly one evolutionary need become weaker. reduced need commercial property could lead increase residential property. Obviously, take time convert/built new buildings, could positive.  Cringe Pence, Linzey Graham, Marco Rubio, et al. Ruidoso? ....don't underestimate rubes...... let's discuss 1000 ways pandemic affects women far worse many billions needed help them. THat's ya get... still iPhone? lots great Windows phones there! threw iPhone away hours taking first shot. That's sad hear.. happen know kind heart condition was? really something think about, thank sharing this.  Wouldn’t make look bad Biden’s sworn everything IMMEDIATELY gets better? small minded simple must think trump federal government's non response virus worth glossing over. Well get vaccinated go college...

.... oh wait. It’s coronavirus sub. topics relate coronavirus. someone refers “this mess”, assume it’s covid.

Also, tip make seem like intelligent person, future reference.

I’ve seen use “it’s really basic stuff here” like 3 comments. Here’s tip advisor gave back graduate school : repeatedly tell people people something simple instead explaining simply mean, actually backfire attempt look smart, end looking arrogant uninformed yourself. 

*if can’t effectively teach worst student room, don’t know topic well enough yourself* 

Now, referring upper level mathematics, applies arguments well. Cheers ;) propose happens people laid since March reach BYE date September? economic plans place shutdowns. ""Told March"".

Lockdowns necessary people insist spreading till ICUs overcrowded.

One lockdown eliminate Covid would work, too, prefer gift keeps giving- small price pay salvation. It’s hard wife she’s stretched thin. work since pandemic started. I’m essential haven’t miss time. work small city government Parks Rec department Northern California. considered government operations workers tentatively Phase 1C California vaccine plan. best part position get outside 95% time stay away almost everyone. really win win department distance outside essential jobs won’t go anywhere. people go know it’s turn go get vaccine? ones getting vaccine docs nurses...sounds right ven though we’ve never met never see again.

I call notary then. notary used once, again, wife clearly line jumped covid vaccine. mean, I’ve read articles old people well. Articles like newsworthy outliers, yes, less outliers many people assume. young people dying willing admit. it’s important talk people take COVID seriously. Well, guess better go help vaccinate others. Grab vial run street drive vaccinations! part post didn’t understand? didn’t say anything count rigged. Non-stop flights London Denver incredibly rare, daily. Yes. mother step father got shots today. total, know four people vaccinated. joke relating long vote count Nevada took.  respectfully disagree, people's actions around virus deadly consequences. point know better, choosing ignore science push reopening economy political agenda deadly choice freely made. else may infected carelessness? Let's martyr guy dying. Hipaa always ridiculus don’t think get anywhere near 2.5k deaths day still pretty awful. nurse put zero gloves, treating spreading virus!! see start horror movie. Like healthcare Annabelle doll know vet wife, office manager veterinarian clinic, vaccinated today. stats also show East Asians feel strongly (strongly agree disagree) vaccine, tend answer closer average. 

I wonder cultural thingt survey answers general East Asia - people less likely answer 1 10. Tests randomized samples. There’s heavy selection bias gets tested. Therefore, it’s improper infer test % 1:1 reflective rate overall population larger sample. Combined asymptomatic nature virus, high positivity likely missing lot positives low positivity rate. nurse, actually bothers bit. vulnerable people know....and many died us lower class(working class) populations. here. remember really bad case flu college December 2013 shortly finals. Almost everyone dorm floor got sick newly built building would think would better ventilation.

I remember really bad coughing fit middle bookstore - felt like going choke felt like going pass walking back room. 

Since then, made sure never miss flu shot take Covid seriously. Yeah, saying something 99% survival rate ridiculous. could say shark attacks 99% survival rate probably accurate. reason I'm accurate data left out. Shark attacks 99% survival rate attacks happen people land. believable. 

That's thing statistics. They're shit unless specific. COVID 99.96% survival rate people infected 55 years old. state understand start elaborate on.

But that's one stat. that's taking consideration death. increase occupation hospitals removal immediate help cases? COVID created influx patients, thereby increasing mortality rate illnesses due lack care? Probably so. get infected go hospital, could possibly contribute death someone else. rabbit hole insane.

So many questions. Much plausible deniability. Appointments vaccination available 230pm 7pm today checked work. ""We"" corrections facility 229pm dude stuff online though making appointment. Single dose phizer 80% effective according paper work submitted California you? live SF almost never see people without masks. 1.7 fatality rate terrifying shit. i've running around telling ultra idiotic 'it's cold' family last 10 months! treatment available death rates go horribly! gosh, running oxygen, never mind ICU beds! swear, people ignoring things continue live happy little world bubble. gonna part class division become super evident. like writing, throw towel helping people don’t want helped take writing full time! comma? many jabs get?  Unfortunately misinformation social media easily read access to.

My aunt developed polio young age one leg that's shorter walks limp. praised polio vaccine little thinks vaccines evil gov't tracking you? That's brainwashing right-wing Facebook groups gets bombarded daily basis.

People(lots baby boomers) getting brainwashed, believing everything Facebook social media platforms truth. Correct, ""One may *effect* change."" animals spreading at-risk vaccinated, death rate hospitalization rate go significantly. don’t need vaccinate everybody get back normal, need vaccinate large change dying hospitalized. talking specifically tailored headlines individuals, aka chose teenager old person people would likely read article teen older person. go ahead start distributing millions sitting around everyone?

Because feds refused provide money pay happen. Utterly barbaric. sick enough hospitalized reason handcuff you. America. appearances, federal government wasn’t talking governors much all. It’s pretty hard plan it’s federal vaccination program. national failure. ordering doses Pfizer waiting Pfizer produce them. Pfizer deep freeze shipping states distribute.

They stop every shot go call someone order one more. person need booster three weeks. time record got shots. went 1,000 vials want recording 5,000 vaccinations ordering 1,000 vials? previous strain neighbors hanging maskless issue me. Now, need worried yards close? still contagious? could predicted Trump would fuck vaccine? No, I’m confused. responding poster seemed think available vaccines include eggs production. 73 million people gonna take vaccine misplaced decimal point reddit comment. awful. It’s like watching kid read first sentence freaking fuck long it’ll take read novel. 

That rate progress isn’t constant. Fuck headline. Yes daily work health care company don’t think meant. feel like people say want ""old normal"" mean lmao. like damn really fucking need fix climate change say want go back normal means want allowed sit around table friends. feel like two wishes coexist... Ohh, der. late reddit 😴 I'm doctor, understand, influenza virus mutates much faster coronavirus does. reason need new flu vaccine every year? would say hardly comparable vaccine. UK age. thought prioritizing Healthcare nuring homes first Christmas came 'Next Groups go vaccine'.... wait what? okay get there! think correct though faster better! Let's keep discussion within Europe, then, shall we? information available somewhere else, would really appreciate someone could point it, find Google anywhere.

Do know transmissibility higher previous strain ways seen before? mean, saying transmit well outside. new strain ""hardier,"" meaning transmitted outdoors like measles chicken pox? once, healthcare system isn’t problem. better worry, he's 2022 know there's going plenty mud-slinging, yet time it'll true able spin it, I'm talking wheelchair! Expect...there unexplained things China pandemic. wait. think skip speculation assume lingers several years. Texas reasonably laid plan. Yep, says right title. Also says “An Illinois high school senior prior health issues died COVID-19 Sunday.” right article didn’t read. He's taking life insurance, health.  ""The needs many outweighed needs few.""

~Supply Side Spock Christmas cases started tested last couple days people become symptomatic and/or people notified relative spent time Christmas tested positive.

What also need remember mutations random, know coronaviruses range presentations animal kingdom scary

The potential genetic recombination zoonotic hosts also immense scary implications, potential long term side effects catching covid. Similar flu regard genetic recombination, even potential high mortality mutations. strains much higher mortality rates first SARS outbreak even order they're vaccinating groups people States? absolutely f****** crazy, that's sad. poor misguided people lol Back February started tracking COVID seriously, would ECSTATIC knew would ~15 million vaccinations done end fucking year virus discovered December 19. 

People need chill fuck get optimism lives. 15 million people vaccinated big fucking deal, dark days March April really seemed like going wait mid 2021 vaccine earliest. CDC recommendations going override State announced plans. plan roll out. preexistings wait. I'm group, see policy reasoning state I'm CBC recommended group March April earliest. Sure do! I’m excited them! Basically, adjust count staffed ICU beds instead total ICU beds. ICU beds much help there's staff run machines take care patients.

Perhaps error said ""France never big vaccination"", take statement literally country cannot exactly personal stance anything. country's people, yes, government, course, country itself.

Given everything else, think we're discussing French people's opinions vaccinations. agree there? Much better. speculated possibility start believe Dr Osterholm. Bad bot ""Dad heart attack another got bill""

Wow, poorly worded headline. cause illness severe others.... would DEATH. That's comforting know. I’m guessing younger.... pneumonia shingles vaccines recommended virtually everyone 65.... Here's hoping vaccinations increase dramatically United States new federal guidance. 41. virus dangerous. cackled like drunk witch CCP #1 ! Uyghurs fine! saying boron directly cures covid. merely illustrating lowers bio markers healthy people therefore providing immense correlation immune system strength.   Churches also long history philanthropy picking months throwing out. I’ve working “essential” worker past 10 months one many reasons year taught us humans don’t deserve planet. there's direct feeder school hospital mostly made local people. average person thinks: ""Covid kills 0.3%. 75+ year olds, old sick people. I'm 75+, pandemic done me, care anymore""

This humans best, one-step superficial thinking. soon, watch.

""Vulnerable 65+ year olds vaccinated, death rate went down, open 100%"". everybody 65 gets Covid, lucky, vaccine instead Covid. see next 10 years real long term effects Covid are. People care course, unless directly affected it. ... um yes? Humans naturally social creatures. Except reddit, extreme minority. seeing family 4 years voluntarily normal. wanting see friends normal. Would much prefer J&amp;J though approved...

Anger negatively affects you. 

Keep doing. lot us, perhaps more, like you. know serious taking proper precautions.

Try positively influence close enough influence. 

Getting idiots getting angry also feeds trolls. Already happened NY 5 days Christmas Eve... shocking Oh god man made spit drink! soon man soon, types jokes blow away. said trials, plural, busted. simply isn’t true. Stop doomer please, it’s insufferable. Yeah, give 2020 ideas. Better recovery? want see death numbers vs last years end year compare soon enough cousins, RIP Billy Marilyn 😞 mean yes absolutely likely agree don’t anything. I’m saying you’ve avoiding get vaccinated, that’s vaccine necessarily works. science shows vaccine prevents getting sick symptoms high degree protection, science doesn’t show vaccination prevents carrier spreading others, much like asymptomatic infections still spread.

I don’t personally care do, vaccination protecting you. he’s vaccinated, still risk could unknowingly bring (or you, you, asymptomatic, could pass others).

There isn’t scientific backing yet show vaccines anything protect illness. Whether carry transmit still known, risk. ""Goes viral"" again? people keep using joke?? never take covid news articles seriously say something goes viral. Yes, get it. nice pun whatever. gets old. Right folks people say “just stop depressed” “pick boot straps”. say that's worth someone's life really? Would sacrifice life could go club? Yea choice literally proteins created cells briefly train immune system, verses allowing potentially deadly pathogen obliterates cells could set myriad health complications, including chronic illnesses even cancers.

How nurse got degree, beyond  Stay home, get lots rest, call MD immediately breathing diarrhea gets worse. Hope get well soon. personally don’t care much hope returns normal well. Would nice able take partner real date again.  Basically every country including EU US ordered Oxford vaccine cheap relative others... 


The UK much worse position terms access vaccines EU US. Moderna Pfizer like everyone else. 


We also may J&amp;J Novavax next month so. notion UK choice approve vaccine simply borne reality. impact load hospitals stricter lockdowns. Dear God hope so. work hospital nursing colleagues gotten vaccine. I've sick I'm antibiotics something totally unrelated. Hoping get first year. one adverse reactions. Sore muscle nurses take Tylenol 48 hours vaccines   Exactly, fear amongst ones paying attention. You’re probably right. I’m trying figure numbers much worse Chicago it’s finally cold snowy.  minor discomfort three months. One year+ minor. I’m glad you, lot us enjoy life outside house, friends, without masks. may already needing vaccine every year two. worst part died vaguely related vaccine. antivaxxers need worry statistically older and/or immunocompromised death sentence comes contracting Covid mean healthy adults prime also run risk dying. 

It's sad family, hopefully wake-up call community. Yes, go CDC website doesn’t even clarify, instance, autoimmune diseases increase risk getting severe Covid. farce. word people different groups sign vaccinated. I’m high risk, parents, waiting around hoping doctors tell come vaccinated.  Good thing VP Colorado then. Got mine 2 days ago. shot normal arm incredibly sore later day next.

This normal.
This excuse get shot.

Yes simple procedure let's realistic expectations, stupid people looking excuse. I'm pretty much assuming everywhere now, everyone else assume thing. kid yourselves. I'm guessing slower new vaccinated selected (elderly/at risk/healthcare workers) - etc. 


Hopefully that's ""bottleneck"" we'll get past soon. Definitely scary put mind ease: saw news story 41 year old died traffic accident local highway, you’d probably overly concerned next time(s) travel road. Similar odds.  UK variant affects younger people children well I’m wrong. No. peak week trended Thanksgiving. spike middle week relative rest week, still much less peak week prior. No. Novel SARS-CoV-2 virus strains. best friend 47, otherwise good health relatively mild case Covid March thought ok. However 9 months like it’s smouldering inside her. Last two months hasn’t able take deep breath. tests last week found partially collapsed lung, scar tissue kidney damage.  

I know two others mild Covid diagnosed type 1 insulin dependant diabetes shortly after. family history, preconditions. One 13 year old kid.  Apparently viruses kick autoimmune disease.

12 people kids parents hockey team, got seemed fine.  minor discomfort worth someone's life

This would people selfish actually stayed inside government totally fucked rollout. 

It’s completely unacceptable next week we’ll 20 million dosages sitting shelves less 3 million arms.

If produce ability hospitals vaccinate staff, go ahead start distributing millions sitting around everyone? What? lol understand.  wouldn’t misrepresent either, offered early would definitely take it.  course never seen anything like before. newly made virus strives public places, idiots act isnt anything awry. US fucked, moreso mass mindset wise nearly bad bad government wise. 14 year old wannabe princess president trying utterly ruin next president lost, can't stand. idiodic people follow even act nothing wrong going dont personally see family member affected. includes family. absolutely disgusting Depends state. mine, they'd required kick workplace notify everyone contact them. people would required get tested.  It’s hard sympathize people refuse wear masks it’s still terrible 41 year old father died. Pointing kicking someone down. places experienced level loss, congratulations, show little sympathy. Yeah, that's works... odds favor. all...  Sure are, reddit. statements scientists study virus downvoted baseless assumptions upvoted spread like... well... second comment implied never said numbers single day (which obviously did) not. quite Doc paramedic ED. love back Doc 🙏 come much year border closure. like pointing out. tested positive today, I'm 40.

(answer: no).

and china allow outside scientists/who come investigate origin development virus? (answer: no)

fucking china. people downvoting this?

Side note: clear, first shot still reduce severity illness (so long long enough first shot i.e. can't walk clinic, someone sneeze face fine) hand, Brazil thirsty vaccine approved, pretty much hope. ""No Shit"" Folder mine getting full shit. Nobody U.S. (outside trials) received second dose yet, I’m sure didn’t mention that.

This guy received one dose 12 days ago, meaning ~50% protection, maximum. isn’t surprising people going get sick. That’s good enough. assume much higher percentage Chinese actually take vaccine western countries, including America. CAROLINEEE Hype train let's goooooo thnk obvious get go lol Yes. first trial meet US's standard vaccine safety. US already two vaccines approved two expected early 2021 without counting AZ. 

Even US approved AZ vaccine now, US expected receive supply UK gets it. reason UK rush approve Moderna. point rushing approval something anytime soon. 30% rate that's causing alarm, right? article linked stated frequency myocarditis influenza 0-10%. Although much higher previous pandemics. 

Honestly thought 30% covid patients heart complications virus nuts me. least treated. Yes time theory passing animals humans. thing January 14th already thousands infections everyone saying looks like it’s obviously passing human human now. China still trying cover playing mouthpiece denial. allowed happen. Oxford signed deals manufacturers agreed sell cost 6 months developed world, cost forever developing world. legally can’t force people get it. China close filthy wet markets yet ? remember back June survey COVID antibody New York positive rate 25%. means least 2 million got though official number 1/10. Wuhan 4% nit surprising. know feeling. yesterday coworker said everyone get covid illnesses (I still can't smell). remind I've lost 3 family members lost uncle. There's coming back dead. still, big deal her. agree. Although hopefully they'll approve pfizer moderna too, people afford get side side, mass vaccination done oxford vaccine. people could vaccinated way. Oh FFS - conspiracy theorists.....it news week would approved shortly. good thing! Im barista wanna scream amount ppl lick finger pick nose cough hand handing money Aussie - orders complied with? authorities enforce them?

In Australia, super strict enforce closure/stay home orders there’s lot leniency.

There’s also lot optional restrictions - example, even it’s still legal work office others, lot businesses still WFH orders. Given situation UK moment, using 'good enough' vaccine we've actually got better idea using 95% effective vaccine wait for. Especially given expected effect reducing hospitalisations deaths.  many weeks till 95% immune done first shot, well second? know 0. signs, ""covid vaccines here"", one talking it.

 


In thread they're talking millions gotten it. I've seen reddit nurses get them.

 


I'm midwest, USA. % keeps rising probably ends 100% vaccination coverage. know 2! best friend husband Actually sold cost price (no profit) argument void Definitely part it... tried SARS time SARS gone never could complete testing.  played big part quickness design vaccine already solved problem. 5+5 hospitalizations control group 0+0 intervention group proof 100% reduction hospitalizations. CI wide low amount data. could easily end 70-90% range. take account age groups risk mostly women. People catching disease imply human-to human infection. ways infection, via animals, feces, food etc. know 2! best friend husband current rate take 5 years vaccinate everyone. 3.5 read herd immunity. nature world understand. 1918 flu likely started America, aren’t assumed it. 

If lab originated suppressed info would make sense world world care probably make changes would painful China. What's covid vaccination goal? Honestly, got deal one bought intention resell it, several years now. daily numbers reported COVID task-force include *only PCR-confirmed cases* past day. There's also federal registry COVID cases based healthcare services reporting (PCR way diagnose).

Oh, way - nobody detects every case. £1.50 dose? works Americans want hospitals going make killing selling dose $100,000+. Relephant Butte Lake? tested years. people comparing totally different circumstances, argument ""you feel anything get it"" hilarious, obviously nobody worried vaccine that. I've vaccinated many things kid. vaccine doubts barely tested compared vaccines, long-term effects unknown, may may worse virus proven much worse flu majority non-vulnerable people. Definitely understandable get soon possible understand everyone put trust that, especially stumbling inability contain virus shown almost western governments, wanna do, eh. It’s time, see distribution volume go way up. might be, lack transparency help. Yes inject shit Movement countries extremely limited right though Maybe bargain her? side effect I'm vaccine yesterday extremely sore ""heavy"" arm. definitely worried side effects seems that's what's stopping others choosing get vaccine. I'll see coworkers feel today tomorrow. 2021 begun There's still problem controlling pathogen loosed. might say solution would secretly vaccinate population problem mutation still issue.

Covid-19 already mutating, imagine virulent pathogen let loose.

The countries would consider vaccines suicidal death wishes. (Basically religious extremists) thankfully countries scientific infrastructure develop biological superweapons, ironically religious fundamentalism stifles scientific development. officially announced yet? news channels place. Hey man, finders keepers Lol. number ""false positives"" ""false negatives"" agree half world locked homes probably 90% tested positive can't contaminate others ?

"" ""In three sets testing data include cycle thresholds, compiled officials Massachusetts, New York Nevada, 90 percent people testing positive carried barely virus, review Times found"" ""

Read article comment! haven’t done yet? think Unless side effect worse disease, cares side effects? headache body aches. can’t handle that? poggers born Shreveport. Louisiana born bred. care politics. I'm sad lost another person. losing more. tables turned positivity rate going too.

That could people symptoms bother get tested around holidays, whereas lot healthy people get tested anyway times (likely due requirements linked everyday activities).

In end day, pandemic plateauing average, going still states handled poorly (like California), clearly natural immunity kicking despite winter season. also want every vaccination known man. Yeah know totally trust everything politician says it’s bad play smart. evacuated Laura went Destin, FL. Stayed beach, sat balcony facing ocean, went restaurants outdoor seating ate outside.

Went shopping sparingly—but wore mask nothing packed.

10-12 days first shot vaccine work provide 53% immunity 
After second shot vaccine effective reaching 95% immunity wonder fact 65+ tend likely healthcare workers support might anything it.

No I'm sure desantis let something like enter calculus... would explain:

1) approval significantly smaller sample sizes normal

2) administering vaccine significantly differently trialed (12 weeks apart vs 3 weeks trialed)

3) bringing Brexit allowed happen PR statements 41- yr old Luke Letlow, congressman-elect, passed complications COVID-19. underlying health conditions. 

 [Louisiana Congressman-elect Luke Letlow dies COVID-19 Dec. 19, admitted St. Francis symptoms persisted eventually transferred Shreveport.  Health Shreveport Chancellor G.E. Ghali said Letlow died heart attack following procedure related infection.  devastating entire team,"" Ghali said.  underlying conditions**,"" Ghali said. ""**It COVID.**""  Except nothing trump? think guy moron equally moronic blame something little control back saying told so. wait. vaccine one thing getting people another. said 20 million would vaccinated end Dec 2 million Vaccinated .that's big difference. clearly sight, that's wishful thinking. many parts world going get worse gets better.

In UK lucky even quarter population vaccinated June. That's provided even quarter people willingly take vaccine.

Further really think idiots can't wear masks take safety precautions going take vaccine? 

Let's realistic, form normality restored certain percentage population still restrictions going many parts world. Safety question. 

Only efficiency bit question mark, really we're arguing whether 60-90% efficient. 

Regardless answer is, good enough. fucking £1.50 dose, domestic production capacity wait orders. 

It could 40% effective I'd still say go it. That's bloody long time now... lie, virus spreading Wuhan Hubei mass testing existed. January, Chinese government fighting virus BLIND. mean lady attacked COVID checkpoint “free” people lockdown near start year, repeatedly violated quarantine rules, went around screaming haven’t looked get vaccinated assuming doses aren’t released general public yet.  assuming far hierarchy get vaccine early. Meh. Safety concern, efficiency. 

Get authorised arms, imo. know mechanism give immunity sound, know safety absolutely fine. yeah dictatorial regime released data showing 490k infections lmao. really odd, guess lack capacity given EMA's staff shortage, that's reason see proactively engaging AZ. takes average 11 days Sweden report deaths. last 5-10 days always show dip. hindsight, EU probably done controlled phased transition EMA.

Therefore, great harm general public's perception science scientific ""experts."" presented facts, hopefully engage good science, recognize Fauci lied, inexcusable so, real damage. frankly, he's kind bad guy so. mean done good things, everyone knows main rule medicine harm. case, harm, failed apologize earnest way work regain trust rightfully lost. Ah, yes. Approving vaccine (Mr. 60% botched trial scientists trying cover results) work. really increase public's trust vaccines. obviously gonna take long, process gonna speed up. also need around 70% people get vaccinated herd immunity kick in. importantly, fragile elderly get vaccinated (who first line anyway) get immunity, life pretty much return normal significantly less people dying covid. understand EU placed bets AZ vaccine, AZ hasnt applied authorisation yet EU. wait? world, America. rest world's  large dealing quite many Covid deniers. Imho. Awesome news. Best luck India! vaccine turn tide country, developing countries. would easy show genetic sequencing. Even PCR tests react positive little different result. example, test used UK shows 2 3 places genome matching. god....
that’s absolutely horrifying.

thank you’re doing. im sorry selfish things ppl happen. 3-6 months bed rest 

is career disaster professional athlete (not sure college kids) mean, 53 sequences completed California December yield reliable result. don’t think matters kind analysis is, there’s 1 million cases California time. It’s significantly small sample size. There’s reason UK sequences 10% confirmed cases. Seems like dad felt Italy. care 45+ beds positives 2 nurses help....unfortunately. Yep. Drug stores, grocery stores even. Lots places get flu shot. 90%? Damn, that's like Asian fail got sore arm flu vaccine, 🤷‍♂️ would still make sense strictly control travel slow down. rate replication, single case one million cases half year. So, definitely worth effort, unless US simply wants give fight completely. Right. biggest issue get past medical staff vaccinated. wife dental field, I'm assuming she'll get relatively soon, idea get info that. I'd like get list get too. Let's get shit with. GOP work small detail next fall. Oh shoot....that could viewed political...I remembered sub requires us pretend trump responsibility ""media hoax"" calls it. Sometimes anxiety anxiety needle stuck faint.  much freedom speech downloading copyrighted blockbuster movies, Trumptroll. don’t know yet. antibodies target protein may ever mutate enough need totally new vaccine.  It’s pretty silly consider America’s current infection rate amongst highest world. It’s miracle anyone let’s Americans visit countries. Restrictions way around ridiculous That's impossible would quite easy confirm genetic sequencing samples time. Totalitarian regimes concerned personal liberty. thought speed countries vaccinate limited production vaccine? Lab origin accepted would painful scientists worldwide work labs many would lose funding. Totally agree. lower number effectiveness would still effective fly vaccine ever had.

Does compare new mRNA vaccines? Maybe, maybe not, administered globally scale enough end pandemic. 3rd world infrastructure -70C vaccine, without vaccinating everyone keep evolving coming back.

Because old tech, Oxford vaccine able rolled usual flu shot people get years come. reap sow. Tomorrow night Yep. :) Hopefully AZ's global manufacturing goes full speed ahead mode now! :D Yeah, said that. course better started, famously accept help rest world screwed test deployment. go there. far understand it, virus chance bumping compatible host cell replicate it. virus move know. like pollen particle floating air. inside body. ingest *one* viral particle, mean going bump ACE2 protein start chain events. fact, nearly impossible odds one virus particle. 
 
If however 10,000 virus particles you, almost 100% going bump ACE2 proteins set chain leads infection. 
 
Statistically point like (let's say) 1,000 viral particles, chances sufficiently bumping ACE2 proteins replicating 50%. ""viral load"". 
Of course could take 400 particles unlucky catches ACE2's get sick. could ingest 2,000 particles somehow get sick never managed latch ACE2 proteins spikes. Highly unlikely, technically possible. 
 
----- 
 
Because new UK variant better chance latching spike proteins due mutation, need 1,000 virus particles replicating enough cause infection. need like (just making number up) 300 virus particles. 
 
So whereas could walk person 8 feet away inhale virus, tiny amount, probably fine.. may takes actually make sick.  
 
And math could totally dumb here, new strain +70% transmissible, know ~surgical masks reduce transmission 70%.. think means we're basically equivalent unmasking everyone. terms contagion. 
It's good.  
   Tragic unnecessary... Trump's enduring legacy. Well crap. Probably weve explosion since October. evidence that? UK quite comprehensive monitoring evidences points originated Kent. lmaoo, gonna go houses, pissed Please stop doom talk. It’s like itching Pandemic drag on. saw, beginning, testing slow virtually nonexistent overtime testing capacity ramped within 2 3 month period. expect thing really truly actually moving faster vaccines ramping testing Finland rural areas masking much (it seems), absolutely social distancing willing self quaratine, problem. also give city folk wearing masks plenty room. Governors okay start, like Dewine Ohio. I'm big fan political views, early listening experts, seemed like going okay. caved vocal idiots right protesting right outside Capitol Building. Exactly much time time work.

This find concerning drugs there. It’s like normal pill polio drops, many conditions drug transported, used also learning process now. Lol know that's fucking happening. didnt get second dose... Someone given vaccine 100% effective gets virus. Wow, almost like mathematics exist. Maybe... we'll see. Though looks unlikely. Shame Apple. violation first amendment freedom speech rights. Imagine believing someone goes anaphylaxis driving home medical care readily available? die.

I think that’s waiting period even side effects rare People wanna left alone mysteriously catch contagious disease. Predictable, vaccine rolls virus mutates keep relevance, thought that's virus work? 

It would also make sense new strain virus becomes less potent, thought whole evolutionary point virus reproduce spread, make sense virus kill host it? tldr: nurse working COVID-19 unit contracted covid 6 days getting first dose vasccine. first dose think gives somewhere around 50%, need second dose get 95% Almost 0 countries succesful getting control,

That's factual. Omitting small countries population less 10 millions, around 29 countries less 20 deaths per 1 million inhabitants. US 1000 deaths per million inhabitants - literally 50 times worse. know enough seats 100 people sit wait 15 minute period? Everyone country needs get covid shot fast timeline. Well, they’re better Canada. question is: trace variant precision? Sufficient lead time: check. Public awareness: check. 

We truly passive nation many respects.  Thank sharing this. Question- wanted send pizzas local hospital, without idea ICU floor is, thoughts best that? delivered general front desk instructions ICU? provider could 'train' 99% population administer vaccine less 15 minutes.

I fucked using example syringes house, normal ones units insulin, rather units volume. family+rest work, nice  Sounds like, Oxford online, supply staff deliver injections currently worry Moderna ""warp speed"" joke lol! Welcome Italy 2.0, unfortunately. Ambulances become/are becoming mobile hospitals till bed available he/she said article says hotel quarantine system fully booked next 10 weeks even people could arrange transport they're stuck. 

And might law obligates government get citizens home pretty shit practice wealthy state essentially abandon citizens fend middle mess. Thankfully countries organised repatriation flights necessary wonder went, like go highest bidder?

I know lot countries got batches vaccines distribute yet places like UK/US, maybe canada believe vaccines take time vaccinate everyone.

also know Germany helped Israel secure vaccines meant EU think pfizer ones currently distributed.

and Israel also bought vaccines population needs Terrible..? really. hold rallies GOP fundraisers without masks, inevitable bound happen... did. argue gravity day long, step outside 10 story window... National post equivalent Fox News Lite Canada. 23 genetic sequences done December you’re confident? 23 nothing. really cause analogy made honestly falls apart talking people dieing.

You need better.

I fully admit probably take little bit time get giant thing moving faster see getting quicker while. effort completely disorganized many players even trying move direction. national guard still activated live helping covid testing.

Not me.

This first I’m tiktok nurses dancing halls people rush get vaccinated? still get test positive give Covid others 2020. Where’s PPE. 2021. Where’s vaccine. 2022. salary gone.  yes, that’s exactly he’s saying. Oh god, hahaha. He's pretending *know?* weeks coordinated lying was? 

I work provincial government. idea Doug Ford company fully aware going ridiculous. *If* know, presents picture government completely control, inept, riddled institutional dishonesty.

So...fuck...I mean, okay, possible. Hey, Canadian media, okay publish notes next government press releases pointing ""this either lie, Doug Ford zero control awareness government"". FDA document find information? hit goal lol. literally still unpacking move across Canary wharf. Pointless politicking appears adverse consequences. 

A longer phased relocation would much sensible move many European staff made lives British partners children born raised would experienced great disruption hasty relocation. math totally dumb, would new strain basically negate standard cloth masks? +70% transmissible, masks (surgical mask level) reduce 70% transmissions... basically taking everyone's mask off?

Also toiletries, clothes, things like phone chargers people need hospital won’t give credit Project Warp Speed, fault?  Sort of... think that's confusing way look it.

For practical / real world disease correct. However, EVERYONE receives vaccinations. 

The smallpox issue due weaponization potential. think person saying could seeing increased young people due mass increase positive cases, young people new strain. sounds like good way keep people shopping CVS incorrect translation original headline thought frowned upon. 

The english translation headline indeed seen ""accurate"", also prone misinterpretation original - makes bad/editorialized translation. 

A better translation could e.g. ""N new deaths recorded"" (which headline says).

Presumably headline says headline makers source want give people room misinterpretation write ""N new deaths recorded last 24h"" easily misinterpreted ""N people died last 24h"". know that's case, mean OK editorialize translation. ""7 confirmed cases SARS"" good contender one-line horror story. I’m saying logistically country Geographically spread US is, challenges smaller, dense nations No, issue state create way identify high-risk people, track already gotten vaccine still needs ship vaccine around state areas people are. 

So without federal money help developing uniform system distribution across states, it’s slowing everything down. still learned put mask. idiot. read EU Weaponized HIV. Damn that’s scary.  think Germany ordered additional doses outside EU plan. difficult situation. opportunity demonstrate EU unity far richer countries accept higher domestic death tolls order avoid breaking ranks?

I consider one third vegetarian one third vegan one third meat eater. health improved ever since discovered new foods never tried before.

I still enjoy bacon cheeseburger burger, medium rare steak and/or pepperoni pizza week tho. k great. FASTER PLEASE prohibitive cost

It literally nothing cost. $20/dose prohibitive. Even could vaccinate everyone, would (2 doses/person) x (350 million persons) x ($20/dose) = $7 billion.

That NOTHING, everyone thinks significant cost ignored never listened matter public policy. ""typical"" U.S. budget, even without additional covid spending, $4 TRILLION. makes $7 billion equal 0.2% typical budget.

This year alone spent additional $3 trillion covid relief, counting monetary policy stuff. $7 billion is, again, nothing compared costs, given vaccine way storage issues MRNA vaccines.

Really Pfizer ""extreme"" storage constraints. Moderna vaccine kept normal refrigerators.

That said, AZ vaccine produced much rapidly (due standard technology) even fewer storage constraints, make better suited rural areas. reasons U.S. government ordered AZ vaccine (along simple desire diversified portfolio). **Cost one them.** obviously better nothing, numbers near Moderna Pfizer are. bragging ""winning formula"" hoped more.

That's still lot medically trained professionals. pharmacists places like Boots also trained administer vaccines. there's probably close half million trained/trainable professionals administer them.

Yeah think that's meant reduced hours. People mild symptoms might see long line people waiting get tested (because reduced hours means traffic hours) decide ""isolate"" instead. 

I put ""isolate"" quotes bc Florida.  don’t want open state international borders? trying rude, seems like population ~28 million (???) healthcare system overloaded (like countries), Australia great shape finish vaccinating really quickly.

Just seems odd crow 4th vaccinations per capita countries aggressively vaccinating past 3 weeks like US space, human resources. also universal healthcare, huge anti anti-vax information program and, well, Trump administration $$$ talking priority agree completely. Absolutely ridiculous hospitals order many vaccines leave collect dust shelves weeks. number actually doesnt tell much, unless deploying random mass testing. Higher positivity caused targetted PCR tests. I'm scientist know I'm talking about, ""doom sayer"". I'm sorry reality makes uncomfortable, that's problem.

Civilization lived World Wars collapse, we'll get this. question many lives lose process. That's true. Importantly, either way, still much higher 0.01%. Thanks (if talking me, since looks like got downvotes.) One initial dose regime approved UK moment, $3 that, rising $5 take optional second half dose 3-6 months. 

It's still 70% effective one dose, 95% 1.5 doses Saving 2nd dose. Everyone got vaccinated already appointment 2nd dose. That’s pace vaccinate entire country less six months. early. That’s far nothing. Ya. point.

It lot easier hell lot easier prevent AIDS. yet nobody blames victims. Congress gave state local govt 340 million dollars COVID-19 vaccine deployment require 10 billion dollars. enough money trickling actual deployment planning vaccine.

Also unlucky side affect virus mutating more. Even nothing changes March/April—if single person vaccinated, death rates still exact even higher today—people going go back normal. interesting question. could extend “should people don’t wear masks/refuse stay home get vaccinated first?” Epidemiologically might best I’m sure people would say no. question risky behaviour less intentional/harder avoid.  China they? Yeah, maybe concern expressed ""karmic revenge"", douche would simply shut fucked off. want none? start none! simple. wrong crybabies thought shit? suffer whine, nobody ever put gun head, threatened death unless go full douchebag.

If everything say makes everyone everything 100% better without you, crying people pointing take priority. Studies natural immunity looking memory cells still anticipate lasting years, similar SARS. haven’t seen anything would suggest vaccine would provide immunity longer, though time tell. Immunity starts detectable 10-14 days first shot even around 80% effective, starting 14 days second shot 95% effective. 

The vaccine prevent disease progression get infected vaccine takes effect. infected day 1, get vaccinated day 4, vaccine likely anything. 

Similarly, vaccinated day 1, could still likely infected day 2-8. Sturgis really affect us. geography half way across country.

Endemic means naturally occurring population, manageable levels. Yes, bubonic plague endemic United States, example. think Ebola considered endemic anywhere far. 

When endemic disease starts spread, first outbreak, becomes epidemic outbreak worsens, outbreaks also contribute high spread (not sure exact dividing lines). epidemics established simultaneously however many continents decided, pandemic. 

This read headlines like ""covid-19 pandemic much longer"". might true--Asia seems getting things control, example--but mean individual countries regions still world trouble epidemic spread. means whole world boiling soup more. government decides covered not, insurance companies add things cover can't deny government decided cover.

there premium covarage gives things like coverage drugs included government coverage, dental coverage (I think basic one ages 16 lower) sometimes even things like laser hair removal. (and costs like 15$ extra month)

For person remote county via community spread we're likely seeing widespread distribution already.

The said 10% infected pretty much pulled number ass. Bahahaha said “normal” people Walmart Damn Oxford University, money they? scalpers. /s thought needed full scale phase 3 trial 90 percent dosage regulators would approve it.

That happened India. 90% effective two doses given 12 weeks apart. going change quickly unfortunately. got covid? NJ sovereign, independent nation. dependent federal government make decisions purchase COVID vaccines, distribution vaccines state local governments. Comparing NJ Israel size nonsensical. politicians already received vaccine real sense urgency gone. makes sense though, real frontline workers. Meanwhile, millions Americans still waiting stimulus eat keep lights on. Great job government! doomed. Good them. sure population grateful gov taking seriously  Israelis control Millions Palestinians West Banks. Tens thousands enter Israel everyday work.

Israel vaccinate Palestinians want beat virus. Even though Palestinian Authority procuring doses via Arab countries. He's dead Narrator: “They meet goal” Why? 

It's still debatable. Plenty experts expected still saying early. Flu vaccination request here, groups risk get healthcare workers get invitation come get flu shot GP. offered everybody default. Real cases 5-10 times higher official.

He's one directing vaccine states helping solve bottlenecks. he's helping, he's fucking up. Astra enough vaccines, they're focusing countries made early orders (UK, India US).

The EU order till late, sense wasting time early orders fulfil. vaccine rolled UK India, Astra focus countries. Keeping schools open / reopening schools always primarily economy, spread.  
 
They closed schools Netherlands parents would forced stay home, thus curbing spread. Government officials says openly.

Even second dose, no-one ever claimed 100% effective. efficacy very, clearly communicated 95% doses. course people still going contract disease. people usually get vaccinated flu netherlands?

You proving point. 

We able nuanced science based discussion revert black white, either-or kind views. doesn’t benefit joint understanding virus. thought American response would great. We’ve got CDC. make HLPC PCR diagnostic equipment. universities private labs cream world’s genius scientists.

And Trump said it’d dwindle away 15 nothing knew absolutely comprehensively fucked. say site, Monday, Wednesday Friday exception federal holidays. would expect update sometime today though Friday (maybe Saturday). But, viruses aren’t visible. I’m confused doctor would say that. he's heading rent free. numbers reported start pandemic really low. course, everybody underreported start, Wuhan bad beginning videos posted (briefly) showing people collapsing street. 

They claim things control now, given extreme lengths went control virus think they're lying (much). rest world hammered pandemic, save face anymore. experience many times weren’t even allowed point damages kids. 

Kids lost entire milestones looked forward to, year plus lives education guidance empathy kids parents trying navigate it. people living wish away continue so, impacts felt long time. anyone know. sputnik peer reviewed yet?  Plenty new viruses emerge periodically that’s novel nothing far . would think anti-mask? often post places saying pro mask.  Private profite companies way efficient. fact CVS wallgreens started vaccination campaign monday. maybe Christmas holidays delay reporting?. Remember thanksgiving saw significant drop following week everyone back work saw things surge again. think it’s entirely possible cautious without giving fear.

Like much news coverage around covid been. would suggest move first-world country... open air prison Gaza Strip? Israelis rushing vaccines there? functionally thing. Every immune system unique, can’t clone one person 100,000 times run clinical trial clones. pick 100,000 different people find 50% immune, means (or given individual) 50% chance part immune pool.

MRNA vaccines could revolutionize vaccine production foreseeable future. could see mRNA vaccines becoming standard many future vaccines including things like flu. It’s still early starting look like act desperation. timing doses seems arrived non prespecified exploratory analysis. another thing points crazy situation is. think maybe give weight acute emergency especially new mutations UK would absolutely fly normal circumstances. Yeah, processing nuance first requires reading article. people won't. Water wet. cases vaccinated person gets infected immunity elicited vaccine. cases vaccinated person fails mount strong immune response. Vaccine failures happen vaccines. completely wrong. Efficacy goes 73% week 3 12 one dose. population, vaccine efficacy 22 days post dose 1 73.00% (95% CI: 48.79; 85.76 [COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca 12/7,998 vs control 44/7,982]).

**Phase 1A** includes paid unpaid persons serving health care settings direct indirect exposure patients infectious materials unable work home, well residents long-term care facilities.

**Phase 1B** includes frontline essential workers individuals 75 years age older.

**Phase 1C** includes essential workers, persons 65 74 years age, individuals 16 64 years age underlying medical conditions.

**Phase 2** mass vaccination campaign persons age 16 years older.

📷 Yes, went 0 70% cases real quick trial different dosage. 9 thousand people. data completely wrong.

3 thousand people received half dosage (mostly young people), 9 thousand received full dosage.

They approving vaccine based 9 thousand people. UK approved vaccine, clearly clearly british nationalism Minister Boris Johnson hailed latest vaccine development ""a triumph"" British science. Fuck tik tok. Maybe that’s happening Russian doctors.  I'm thinking exclude them. postpone vaccination. think upmost best reduce risk getting infected, rewarded. It’s stressful right vaccine. many people desperately want get it, far we’ve shitty distributing it. fucking give already.  I'm surprised would give someone working home... long term data, mean worth getting. believe benefits outweigh risks. Everything side effects. fat, smoking, drinking alcohol, taking prescription medication, supplements, driving... basically, existing risk.



Even still get covid, would bet effects disease would less severe (once receive second dose).



Definitely worth me. Also often seems like lot comes people every thread claims frequently wrong misleading. doesn’t matter many times proven wrong they’ll go post different thread next day. repeatedly suggested coronavirus would bad flu, one point saying probability dying coronavirus less hit asteroid.

Mate need scientific evidence know anyone influence downplaying deadly virus like this, put people danger directly contributed infections and/or death. 

I pick choose, someone gone one record ""its flu"" bullshit, fuck right off, excuse little late. aren’t using fast enough 1) there’s federal leadership, many states bought vaccines 2) states cities need funding able roll everything properly. Democrats Covid bill included this, republicans took favor corporate meal write offs. Colorado sequences 1/400 cases. every sequenced version expect 400 surface. 400, Colorado, lot.

But cannot responsible current surges. believe contagious, cause surge quickly account 50%, 80%, 99.9% cases. Right put upper bound percentage cases responsible based sequencing doing. bound still well 5%.

In theory R value 50% higher previous variants, percentage initially rise 50% per viral generation (&lt;1 week).

My guess first sign we'll cases start rising one large Colorado counties - probably one near airport. far sustained decline last month. people never fail wrong thing whine Christians regarded angels. money protects Rona, fuck Dat vaccine yo!

Trump’s Operation Warp Speed promised 20 million doses U.S. year-end, states received 11.4 million doses, according CDC.

Surely blamed anyone else lacks actual responsibility. Maybe focused frivolous lawsuits.... Simental's parents said health problems, still, virus took life young age

She obese...  interesting see. According mask enthusiasts, see sharp drop number new infections Sweden 7th January onwards. blame needs assigned squarely US Republican Party. im talking Trump here.

Jesus, fucking thank you.  even keep mods around? “yes, powerful man government country fucked virus downplayed lied day zero, don’t mention it. him. party. followers. YOu’Re PoliTIcIziNG TOo!” Deceptive headline. daily death rate, people think about, lower first wave peak. Today deaths reported. covers deaths, roughly last 2 weeks. reporting 24th-28th December Christmas report weekends Mondays,so reporting today yesterday mostly cover days... understand recommended mask wearing times public transport. would much clearer message. Gotcha. None normal, right saying normal conditions allow stagger doses best way protect amount people, especially vaccine good preventing hospitalizations. confident data show immunity lasts 3 months next dose administered though. best come America previously come America job. become less true wfh grows historic, unprecedented vaccination rollout, issues like Affordable Care Act rolled out.

B: not. Stop lying. 

C: comment removed far know currently even vaccinated chance able get spread virus.

Immunity mean complete immunity virus technically infect interact immune system, bounces can't infect others.

Then there's immunity get symptoms infect others exceptionally high chance beating fairly trivial infection. words never develop anything mild symptoms.

As stands right assume significant amount people vaccinated still capacity develop mild symptoms test positive.

I know there's lots details spinning around, seems one people keep missing. idea immunity varies viruses people mean like Superman immune.

Heard immunity also mean enough immunity eradicate virus, means there's enough immunity groups people virus cannot go serious outbreak mode. outbreaks limited cumulative immune resistance group people. that's immunity mean immune never did. scares PARTICULAR (in caps lock becuase want underline antivaxx general, one) )vaccine one seems responsible anything happens:  requires everyone Belgium March still antibodies then. Absoulutely: think key policy based weak science without ""bad policy"". science weak argument masks, argument conducting better science. Policy can't always wait good science. That's confusion comes from. Concluding ""you wear mask"" fine, concluding ""a mask would saved person X"" bit premature. let's agree comes phrasing, one sprinkles ""maybe"" ""likely"" changes everything. Rural areas small localities can’t even get handle availability dry ice. One anonymous source described distribution far flung rural populations perhaps “impossible.”

Accuracy made Sad. actually 90% efficient second dose given 12 weeks first (which regimen ultimately approved). It’s both. system doesn’t safeguard well enough dogshit incompetent president here. 

God bless career government officials who’ve done best keep rails, though. Actually giving shots easy. Took like 5 mins training examples I’ve races. Probably easier people don’t imagine many fight much animals. know one person vaccinated it’s staff.

My boyfriend go couple hours ours. healthcare though  Isn’t change due contagious virus? need act instead waiting become widespread.

So, yes, it’s scientific. Someone read article, even skim it.  Well Covid faster news reporting sure :) one London's busiest hospitals forced wait 24 hours bed A&amp;E doctors nurses — said 'breaking point' — urged bosses declare major incident. added didn’t believe hospital bosses fully aware happening saying: “After told them, ball got rolling order went straight away turn wards around beds appeared fairly quickly. 243 deaths week btw, 24 hours. second dose given within 21/28 days first else it’s useless. It’s possible get everyone first dose 21 days. Even immunity started, companies made virus said numbers represent sterilizing immunity means still get virus show symptoms spread it. recover fairly easily.

That's immunity means viral immunity. actually mean guaranteed immunity virus bounces cannot infectious.

I need think immunity triggered virus technically infected right. else virus immune system interacting?

But beyond sterilizing immunity far manufacturers anybody else said. means get test positive even fully vaccinated... far currently know.

It's likely course percentage people get strong immunity percentage people get weaker immunity perhaps another percentage get even weaker immunity. That's kind kronovirus rolls comes immunity surprised vaccine similar vaccine defeat virus triggers man-made immune resp onse specific part virus chose attack, hopefully right part.

Immunity much complex people give credit for. specific reaction everyone slightly different immune system every slightly different virus. There's set stone way look viral immunity viruses little ever changing life forms immune system really evolving rapidly. lot unpredictable interactions lot like half reliable immune responses immune response like good enough gets job done really kicking virus's ass barely beating it.

You also look different vaccines different viruses work see immunity vaccines follow kind set pattern immunity mean thing time. People can't seem take news like well get downvote instead making argument. know lot people antivax stretch, want *first* take new vaccine. see side it.

I minor surgery yesterday chatting nurses surgeon about. They've vaccinated said vast majority staff side effects, arm soreness like many vaccines cause. side effects, low grade fever mild flu-like symptoms, couple docs took sick day two. broke single-day record COVID-19 deaths yet Tuesday, logging 442 fatalities a [Times county-by-county local health jurisdictions — number equivalent someone dying disease every three minutes.

Richard Nixon 😂 Definitely. 

Husband works industry, work public school system. work transparent protocols exposures, track everything, tons restrictions place. Mine tell us anything, barely follows protocols, loose restrictions.  It’s boost prime vaccine, first injection actually *boosts* immune system, lowers it. Thanks pointing sloppy language.

Taiwan necessary steps bring zero cases transmitted home.

The US could wanted. Spoiler alert. many people even take available.  Karma, Drew. give vaccine millions, I, Wizardess Oz, predict: someone faint, someone die albeit mostly heart attacks something else, people first shot still get virus, smaller number get virus second shot - remember 95% effective - people scars knees! anti-US hysteria right now

You could ask topic reddit, vaccines lol fighting good fight.

And they're way detrimental cause, thus downvotes. emphasize, guy rural ass Colorado *had travel history*.  So, something like Rabies HIV exist? untreated 100% deadly well able spread. spread kill.

Which.... exactly SARS-CoV-2 does: spreads first week infection kills typically third week. vaccine that? thought Pfizer Moderna well? Check state health department. imagine aren’t advertising enough doses healthcare workers point change open people. 98.3% survival rate

Which also includes hospital admissions, patients intubated, weeks teetering verge death, people permanent injuries, etc.

Maybe 1 100 die, might 50 100 needs medical assistance, 10 100 admitted ventilated, etc. I'm sorry stupidity Americans blatant disrespect ones risking lives shit paycheck help save ungrateful asses every day. eventually lose hospitals ran, worked, doctors staff sick. fucking morons expect safety net time get sick going suffer horribly die. reality can't keep situation fact getting worse seem stopping soon slowing going end lot population America. Brace yourselves, winter forgiving. luckily actually 70% first dose, 95% second! 55% increased rate transmission - make increased risk infection? I'm sure realize overwhelmingly arrogant sound, care. whatever point trying make lost sounding like complete douche. It’ll dumb mental gymnastics removal guise “incivility isn’t allowed” except mods need realize automod rules suck. isn’t la la land assholes deserve called reality adult world could see that. Steady-state believe cities would still retain people due increased range amenities get high density capitalism, dynamically definitely see lots people saying ""finally get away traffic noise crowds!"" laid 330,000 bodies ground lined tightly shoulder shoulder, would span nearly 100 miles. ...why would China comparable rates vaccination infection levels literally several orders magnitude lower? get pod eat bugs. Seems last resort. Israel hit quite hard virus one first countries go 2nd lockdown roughly. China ordinarily track influenza deaths, prepared keep track mortality. ~ 4600 deaths revision. 

Similarly, serology accurate enough get estimates hundredths percent. 

The early fatality estimates thing - *with* critical care available - held well, though.  current situation already? feel might entirely political, given contagious UK strain going around now. public transit major source transmission before, still, one's really sure new strain behave differently community settings like public transit.

I can't even imagine thinking going public transit without mask anymore. I've seen first dose closer 50% don’t GAF grandma shirt ever seen. always infected. First there's 5% chance vaccine work second immunity mean can't infected spread virus point.

That's called sterilizing immunity also highlights fact there's different types immunity definitely mean sterilizing immunity.

Basically viral immunity means immune system fight virus. mean get symptoms mean spread virus. Now, maybe we're lucky case vaccine, vaccine makers know confident data suggests like 100% 95% sterilizing immunity.

Because vaccine targets spike protein leave behind less dangerous parts infection exactly know that's going mean yet.

So vaccine everybody still get infected far know. difference body able head virus develop really bad symptoms lead death long-term damage..... Hopefully.

So really immunity means level increased viral resistance body's immune system whether antibodies B cells mechanism really know about.

I believe viral immunity especially scientific term, exact definition. like immunity, like loosely used semi-scientific term. 365 days said go forth vaccinate... 

When compared nothing looks good. (to taken best possible way.) face truth afraid of? Phizer’s ability deliver vaccines appropriate temps maintained 2 weeks great wonderful. problem.

Check propublica article state level preparedness vaccines received. Beyond standard 1000 dosage shipment major urban hospitals, rest reads like looming cluster fuck possible epic proportions. amount trauma related admissions result alcohol far outnumber 5% heavy drinkers. Sadly numbers game hospitals overwhelmed. need keep beds open refusing treatment Covid patients. Tell HIV rabies virus. latter 100% deadly. Nuclear technician. Oxford vaccine approved easier vaccinate huge amounts people well (although I'm sure US bought doses one). main purpose vaccinations reduce mortality morbility, happens vaccines ever exist also reduced spread COVID-19 vaccine there's still final evidence documented one roughly 6 anaphylaxis reactions? 60,000 people per state, per day sound like far fetched. understand simple placed like California, New York, etc. need states. Still sound outlandish applies interaction Pfizer government. Hospitals holding back doses don’t know anything many they’ll get states, states know slightly much they’ll get federal government. Even Pfizer told US federal government wouldn’t interruptions, feds would transparent states would transparent hospitals. news. reason country surging right now.

That's issue Cars example obviously. point going back normal brings good bad op others hard time understanding. Covid terrible given us look tell change behavior look like. good bad. kills thousands people, that’s less flu it’s nothing worry vaccine causes one death (maybe), therefore it’s evil conspiracy 1% kill never ever trusted anyone  Yes. Yes is. That’s exactly going say. men going everyday women stay home
And don’t leave therefore don’t get covid(unless contract husband). Confirmed vs unconfirmed doesn’t play it.

It’s still big number proof nations can/will weaponize disease? Considering people convince ones think certain vaccines cause autism—this unfortunately unlikely. even cold chain, cost vaccine matters too. 

The AZ vaccine likely cost ~$15/person. Still 5x expensive regular vaccines countries. better than..

- $20/person Gamaleya

- $50/person Pfizer Moderna

- $150/person Sinopharm

Novavax supposed come ~$8/person. Still expensive. 

It'll likely someone like Bharat Biotech targeting $2/person vaccine makes meaningful difference developing countries.

I'm FL many testing sites open every day, Dr's I've heard of, including mine, get same-day Covid testing. There's also pay-for-testing place right road that's open everyday want wait line somewhere call Dr.  Several articles [show via search. saying death rate then? US almost 4K yesterday... ""Months apologizing"" using sort like karmic revenge post lol. course medical professionals downplay virus, knew March (when downplayed it) vastly different know today. thought pandemic get anywhere near bad last March.

Maybe journalists continue attack still downplaying, ignoring otherwise refusing fight virus *today* dude lives LA skeptical virus March. Parly also peak infections 2 3 weeks ago. That's time lag infection, hospitalization, Covid disappears Easter country. went church celebrate. Oh idk maybe part app facilitating private parties pandemic? know, kind supposed right pandemic. plan vaccine four weeks.

like pyramid scheme? flu folks. flu. Why? Mutations? negative comments people want medical surveillance state last forever stay home, order UberEats, watch Netflix Porn, get validated anti-social shaming people struggling mental health issues isolation. place sick warped, karma find soon. People know argued school reopening saying kids can't get infected since get sick hit. 

No. closed schools separated other. Making school online forced kids isolate. reopened, kids started getting people shocked. absolutely baffled thought kids immune. I've read, mid-to-late January they'll submit FDA Nah want old normal back. USA integral part getting vaccine market everyone said would take least 18 months years. everyone complaining can’t get fast enough government botched rollout.

Cant win people. You’ll always find something complain about. hurt feelings? 

## Abstract

**Background**

Currently satisfactory pharmaceutical intervention available COVID-19. retrospective study aimed determine therapeutic effect thymosin alpha1 critical COVID-19.

**Results**

We enrolled 109 critically ill severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 RNA positive patients 15 hospitals. mortality rate critical patients treated thymosin alpha1 11%, compared 56% critical patients treated thymosin alpha1. confounding factors adjusted multivariate logistic regression, thymosin alpha1 treatment identified protective factor critical COVID-19.

**Conclusion**

Our observation advocates treatment critical COVID-19 thymosin alpha1. meant normal meant go lockdowns again. course practicing social distancing mask wearing. 
But restaurants bars definitely opened again. I’m sure sporting events concerts. prime sources hospitalization goes 65+ crowd death rate also collapse younger crowd get better treatment since there’s much strain. 

If continues longer virus least worries society large collapse. Stop pessimism patient things get better heading towards better future lot conservative news watchers still believe this. Yep. helping employers manipulate acknowledging cases too. stupid comment Workers. years bought large portion Christmas gifts hospital gift shop work. time go elsewhere. recently taken National gift shop chain quality variety items plummeted, still pick stocking stuffer items year. Good Lord, 16,329 cases one day 501,000 US cases one day, happening there?, one wearing masks?  Although think IFR dropped bit summer fall better treatment, drugs, oxygen. would estimate value around 0.3-0.4% many western countries. Apparently UK looking going route giving second dose upto 3 months later. delaying second shot weeks likely issue then? People thankful Health Care workers busting asses save many give shit getting it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* We've done everything wrong point, probably right. Good you? Gallup! Pew, lol. Still, data same. Sorry wasn’t sure speaking about. 
But I’m still sure point. 
Everything see still points ifr around 1% developed countries. nurse symptoms 6 days shot. Probably infected week time. Important clarification. people fixated underlying conditions? Yes, underlying conditions make Covid severe, doesn’t mean people underlying conditions aren’t susceptible severe infection. I'm glad read article comment misleading focuses one point interpreted pretty insignificant. strategy administer mitigation understaffed due side effects makes complete sense. Presumably could short time assure side effects there's nothing article saying hospitals vaccinated anyway (e.g. staggered). article cite also says nothing hospitals ""sitting 80%"". Instead, completely glossed looks largest contributor poor statistic: they're counting ""shipped"" state reports number ""shipped"" doses, necessarily mean state yet. lag doses shipped doses administered seven days, said. also 24-hour window reporting vaccine administered, adds delay numbers reported. 

The article also links NYT article providing additional data ""shipped"" vs ""received"" quantities: said, numbers still woefully inadequate excuse poor planning roll states months prepare for. Logistics complicated hospitals business logistics (as see pretty much every State across board). love you. Yes! Think people see Christ followers people. awful Well crap, came elementary school kid. remember talking episode giant spider sighed autograph me.

She actually convention attended couple years ago too, talk then. 2 people know work medical related field extended family member whose nurse hospital, got vaccine week ago least. know dermatologist PA getting tomorrow, TX. reporting much responsible U.S. media would ran 10 stories 10 people experiencing side effects 100,000 think international travel accounts \~1% new cases COVID Canada, anyone entering country needs serve 2 week solitary confinement sentence, also come proof sick entering country. makes stupid fascist. Oh bad fucking competition. need wake fuck up. first shot january would mean results come 3-4 months so? study produced results large enough accepted. Also include 55s unhelpful current distribution phase. Sadly never know sure condelences thinks need 70-85% vaccinated see dramatic decrease cases? 6% population already gotten it. ones actually tested positive. I'm assuming number much higher. feel like aiming way higher needed

Then expert I'm random knows nothing diseases I'm going assume probably right. Virtually nobody uses cash money Qld, Australia. Everything tap go. seen plenty signs shops requesting card only. j&amp;j comes 90% oxford still sits 70% US trial, see getting approved. still critically important south asia, africa.

And yeah, know percentages also apples apples way trials executed... Hopefully US trial provides baseline compare Pfizer 1:1 also enhanced testing protocol vaccines limited healthcare workers, first responders, even frontline workers, surprise.

If anyone could get vaccine, goal would met. also one Warp Speed candidates (plus Pfizer) failed produce antibody levels strong contracted COVID-19. We'll see... probably something natural rural folk suspicious outsiders, it’s like moving schools junior year high school. could Heath lager still outsider, way history.

Yes, racism certainly part picture, although part. course racism exists outside rural US, US mix racism, along nationalism, partisan politics, anti intellectualism, excessive uncritical devotion capitalism, bald eagle idols, gun views, amongst many characteristics combine together create toxic heady sort mix solely unique culture good ole USA. Oh well.. Nice chatting. I'm sure that's big issue people make be. Moderna vaccine stored 8⁰C (46⁰F) 30 days BioNTech one also stored temp 5 days indefinitely using dry ice. Keep working assholes!  That's quite surprise considering herd immunity bs entirety LA “super spreader” right now. That's insanely good. Given price ease logistics, vaccine stops Covid-19. utterly pointless article. People want better lives healthier world reguardless pandemics. Hunter Thompson, you? mean, Sweden failing exam. others too, despite studying Ppl get togethers parties LA, cmon. Look Ellen Degeneres tested positive. No- criticized survey nature, reason criticize survey data believe differential reliability surveyed populations. subject reliability concerns reason think interferes direction effect.

Personally I'm looking forward getting vaccine get back road ""normal"" again. thought said 1/2 dose worked better  I’m high school California public schools closed area high school sports year. think private schools opened closed cases. speak Bay Area NorCal Sacramento area can’t speak SoCal got New Years resolution you: day learn live life comparing others improve quality life mental health. Research add repertoire. :) Sign up! wear mask even tho despise statement sends... government force wear damn thing. Fact it’s likely helping. moment (10 days lol) I’m vaccinated anyone says anything getting one finger salute talking procurement, approval. Strangely science this. Since low blood oxygen biggest predictor complications, stands reason (1) low blood oxygen already would vulnerable (2) descending elevation would comparable getting hospital care. 

But actual data seems conflicting. Mostly really low mortality high elevation places, may huge exceptions. Colorado's CFR flat 1.0% since early June, essentially lowest anywhere. Colorado also youngest healthiest state hard judge that. places South America high elevation huge mortality. 

There lot confounding factors. People live mountains generally healthier. hospitals generally built valleys. 

I live high elevation (have 8000' year) pay attention this. enough people anyone interested studying it, seems. row Canada political, scientific. idea even trying say, trials published Western papers English. cared, would read eyes.

Hey there. download Apollo Reddit, block subreddits want see. ban you, think anything. Regardless, happy help. Absolutely right.

And whatever dosing claim best, enough data behind FDA approve it.

And that's makes frustrating. I'm likely last 10% US population get vaccinated. state even considers murderers rapists deserving me.

I'd ok getting Oxford vaccine, screwed trials badly seriously doubt vaccine see light day here.

And I'm rooting hard team J&amp;J. Seems states health departments Federal government act. Well, thing crystal ball would tell 200 000 people ones surely die covid, would need vaccinate 200 000.

Of course crystal ball, target group vaccinated quicker prevent 99% deaths. Generally option one get, people many places offered one that's available. 

However, AZ although higher chance getting sick protects nearly 100% developing strong symptoms. lot people would needing hospitalization ""mild cold"".

Obviously I'd also prefer swanky mRNA jab need get society back feet I'll take I'm offered. I'd theoretically fact I'd still 40% chances catching Covid - possibly developing ""long Covid"", linked even mild infections - disturbs me. healthy young adult already minimal chances dying still vulnerable long Covid, vaccine seem offer enough protection compared efficacy mRNA ones.

It's Commission, EMA. Anyways, full review 11 weeks normally takes 7 months 3 years efficient. Anything shorter would rubber-stamping.   Gotcha. Yes, know money helps problems. Like not, Tribal lands hold sovereign power.

Don't see worse happening Vegas. Maybe rattle deniers. Everybody loved Mary Ann. According briefing MHRA gave morning, trials involving people receiving doses various separations (up 26 weeks, IIRC), thought enough evidence 12 weeks pretty good (number small them, think, though think far unpublished data).

EU UK friends anymore. great bob... That's 400k people since last update 2 days ago? thing USA going vaccinated earlier. 
The EU ordered Biontech vaccine. Biontech vaccine per population.

As European hear lot local news mishaps mishaps also exist USA. 
It approved US Dec 11th, Europe Dec 21st. Germany first doses given Dec 26th. can't expect EU already caught vaccination level Americans. rolled out.

Yuuuup. (I one people. sucked. even get testing case severe enough hospitalization, told ride home stay self-quarantined. give experience 0/10 -- would recommend!)

I'm hoping people developing long-haul symptoms cases they're catching least come better informed spend months going ""why feel like crap time? can't seem think straight?""  kinda weird. Guess plenty data people study awhile. Commenting look comment later. every report, FDA livestream, breakdown I’ve read/listened past months don’t think anticipate case. I’d interested hear someone background answer question. literally look entertainment within drive-able distance live, isn’t crowded theme park though. It’s nothing gives aura someone that’s never complained anything lives ever, surely? Even it’s necessary recognize that, okay complain something you’re unhappy every while. 

You’re going push away people telling shut fuck grow pandemic measures aren’t ending quickly they’d hoped. Again, long Covid associated even mild cases. Proof Google search away. Getting it, even mildly, STILL bad.   It’s never late. understand nothing moves fast enough arm chair epidemiologists sub, Canada makes much safer countries coming months still haven’t taken step.

I wish done months ago - saying “too late” implies offers zero benefit Canada future simply ignorant. Nah. People learn. We'll back pre-COVID normal quickly over, make mistakes next pandemic hits. CDU going everything bring back normality country then.

No, CDU going everything bring back normality *the elderly people country* then, that's group usually votes CDU. Much smaller task. Takes 0 drive mom's house...cause I'm already there. Looks like Maine Vermont first states hit vaccinations reported cases. we've probably already reached 2% vaccinated, they're vastly under-reported right now

deaths really drop like rock till vaccinate around half 65+ age group- around 8 9%. especially since many hospital early December surge dying week two. Love help one allowed vaccination except seniors 65. 

I idea status medical personnel. think phrases get bit twisted every time. end pretty consistent things getting progressively better April fully normal fall. UK, 100 million pre-ordered.

Four million ready go, someone (I think Hancock) said 500,000 think it’s 4mil means many start with.

Fifteen million ready put vials, ready manufactured. Relying what? Herd immunity? Sure. that's case, big deal wait April already three vaccines approved then.

It expected vaccines would available general population spring anyway. afford time ensure proper data beforehand. honestly think handle near constant rejection therapy providers top everything else, thank kind words. four page ""plan"" say anything helpful vague completely useless. 

For example, counts ""congregate care setting""? offer medical services? HBCS? section 202 buildings included subsidized housing?

However, us 2.5m people immune vaccination January 19 2021, we're actually three weeks ahead model. ones saying cant enter country. follow rules.

We global pandemic, tough shit. still job something don’t understand. vaccine effectiveness 70% 90%. 

The 90% effectiveness comes vaccines adminstered error: half dose, normal trial revealed 62% effectiveness participants given two full doses COVID-19 vaccine 90% 1,367-participant subset United Kingdom given half dose followed full Unexpected dosing deviation 
AstraZeneca attributed surprise deviation trial dosing (ie, half-dose/standard dose regimen) 1,367-participant subset manufacturing error quantification methods used batches, resulting vials 50% less vaccine regimen would much effective intended dose explained, although researchers theorized lower first dose closely mimicked infection, experts saying could result different size type participants subset receiving lower first dose include participants older 55 years—who tend mount weaker immune response younger counterparts—because different dosage given early trial, older adults original trial design included single dose COVID-19 vaccine, second dose added phase 1/2 trial results showed improved immune responses another dose.

Given news [USA expects approve vaccine plus EU tight requirements vaccine yet seen vaccine used globally not. 

The AstraZeneca vaccine low cost effectiveness bad established vaccines probably become low-cost future.

I mean better vaccination vaccination. choice AstraZeneca Biontech/Pfizer contenders probably take vaccine proven better studies. general every major country west ordered many times vaccines (2 8 times more) population size. Testing isn’t thorough India.

Most cases (and deaths) officially counted. Ya long covid real dude. haven’t tasted smelled 4 months morning runs hell. resting heart rate went 60 75-80. Legit run 40% long before. I’m late 20s healthy otherwise.

Yah starting think getting vaccine many people possible better super slow targeted rate. thought 2020 get worse. RIP Mary Ann. Thanks, Get tables ready. start vaccinating general population, suspect around summer, things quickly go back normal terms people's behavior. mean, there's either one two things happen:

1. likely vaccinations work virus stop spreading near fast deaths plummet. Maybe we'll couple hundred day health experts say still need wear masks distance etc. point, people sick things going get back normal. 

2. least likely scenario something goes wrong vaccines work. really, really think going happen even did, predict people 'fuck it' mood give go back normal we'll live higher death rate. minority might still shield distance mask predict people it, even absolute worst-case scenario.

So, yeah take it, get sunlight, don’t expect miracle today. Mom made new prediction: 

The vaccines rolled health care workers first they’ll die (killed vaccine). way one go we’re ill, thus leading us die. 

Excuse me. fuck? true. checked states full list many grocery stores well urgent cares health centers work hospital. There's 330 million Americans. 84 million children. We're vaccinating anywhere near 330 million even 300 million, like 250 million. vaccines might still long ways cleared use 17 under. website sums vaccine timeline. know pfizer granted emergency use, decision moderna jan 6th, know vaccines, like anything? makes sense they’re worried supply. Pfizer Moderna collapse, we’ll bigger problems hands. Plus, one dose confers significant immunity, makes sense double numbers, either way consider that. finally caved gave haircut last week. missed window open haircut since February . worst, great either . Biden's pick Surgeon General said along general population get vaccine fall. perverse reason, United States wants stay COVID hell. actually get really uncomfortable see types posts I’m Christian want best example preventing spread disease like Christ Right, governors control them. need federal permission mobilize them. like want complain federal government. ain't it. think UK 20 million vaccinated end 2021? 4 what... 4? 

Most powerful country riddled disease.  Really needs 1st large margin. STRIKE Oh hi douche. Found you. big deal, right? Oh no. Condolences family friends. direct link article referenced above:  still want it. mRNA vaccine. 

Everyone around hungry get Xbox Series X, PS5, 3xxx series RTX Card. nah; want vaccine baby! Lack funding leadership years. top-tier scientific organization run itself. mean actually follow guidelines special? problem people see millennials, boomers. people call out, best case temper tantrum, worst case pull weapon you. understand said.

just testes positive SarsCov2 mean infected infectious. ton people ""test positive"" 0 symptoms. Plus, cases even person within home tests positive infect others.

As said article, test ""positive negative"", know viral load person. proves care far property lives. surprised. People tired stuck home looking entertainment outside 4 walls. saying condone agree it, totally understand it. Ya get ya vote for... That's happening. Especially one make appointments anywhere booked things thanks Covid + problem letting folks inside anywhere didn't? [They've reporting daily case count including categories suspected, imported, confirmed, recovered, ill, dead, asymptomatic, close contacts, medical observation, every day since beginning 2020.](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/list_gzbd.shtml) Yep: ""...more two dozen athletes university **who tested positive COVID-19**, 30% cellular heart damage 15% showed signs heart inflammation caused condition known myocarditis...""

So 30% athletes Exactly like programs run background PC's looking extraterrestrial life. harness thousands grad students help this? Schools must remain open frontline medical staff need stay open keep going work. dunno, wasn’t really making statement that. commenting science. 

It’s unfortunate federal government didn’t care people provide people money needed get by. quote nothing like childish statement written above. federal government force follow rules administered. federal government wields massive power. Ever wonder drinking age 21 determined federal government? federal government leveraged power get done. could easily coordinated federal level efficient possible. could easily force hospitals, pharmacies, even places like clinics distribute doses nationally expedient efficient manner. Instead say ""here go, like, hope works out!"" kind sicko ate fried mink? feel like possibility bio+terrorism weapon made national security go full defence mode rather let spread. ironic. spend much military simple virus cripple nation. doses even made yet, let alone actually distributed. saying others tested various scenarios earlier phases conducted large, randomized, controlled phase 3 study based promising scenario earlier phases. means no, test phase 3 determined would test earlier phases. J&amp;J conducted phase 3 trial single dose regimen decided also test two dose regimen. add existing trial. applied begin second large, randomized, controlled phase 3 study.

The fact phase 3 trials many different places testing different assumptions exactly critiquing them. combining data together presenting claims similar Pfizer Moderna. 90% efficacy rating half/full dose regimen 2500 people &lt;65 way similar Pfizer's 44k trial tests exact regimen interval everyone trial. **can** one treatment group randomized controlled study, **cannot** combine data, exactly Astrazeneca Oxford claimed vaccine 70% effective based combining half/full full/full dose regimen data. also **cannot** confidently make claims around efficacy statistically significant group people treatment group. believe Indian trial enrolled 40k people. claiming vaccine effectiveness based interval 3-4 months vaccines, also need share many people 40k trial arm arm representative entire population. also read previous 90% efficacy claims stand analysis, makes skeptical whether new claims too, see actually tested tested on. 18? starting new phase life. Heartbreaking Hopefully enough soon would sure speed Canada's vaccine timeline 1115 1236 caught means roughly 10% tested positive.... There's way could gone experts proof police reprimanded made sign NDA's sharing coworkers. blame going press? Ai Fen's press interview wiped internet. scared retaliation local government, know right so. Even apology issued died overworking COVID.

It's like literally anyone post anything Twitter okay. People go press putting stake. January 21st: ""Why President Biden stopped yet?"" Yep discovered mean appeared... could weeks months. Can't find look even done sampling miss it. Yeah, also diseases strains trapped ice may stuff humans never even seen before. people claiming would vaccines November, December, tens millions Americans vaccinated Jan 1 sure touchy.



Almost like wrong every time frame pull rears lame duck l'orange speed it. using military give get numbers? 80 million people children vaccine approved for. That, itself, may happen July Pfizer submits full authorization.

Roughly 250 million people divided 3 million per day=83 days. That's like mid March, July.

Assuming J&amp;J's single shot approved, missing something? Yes keeping son basement week totally isn’t child abuse /s Again, please read wrote. didn’t say feelings, focused feelings. obviously want keyboard warrior, it. Inferring I’m bigot ridiculous I’m going engage discussion. Proverbs 27:12 “A prudent person foresees danger takes precautions. simpleton goes blindly suffers consequences.” anyone else think dude article preview Ted Cruz? Riskier means earn living? person arrested. saner society would be. Thank reply. Again, sorry isn’t allowed, I’m regular person trying right thing. Sitting staring screen hours end sounds great!! acted coronavirus stunning force, official narratives recount. political logjam allowed local outbreak kindle global pandemic. MHRA numbers staff Brexit... mean...it depends believe, right? friends family thought Black people genetically inferior (a widely held belief long time), unfair impose form social cost That's scary ... US need vaccine past March everyone then. know, kinda thinking that. disrespect Hillier kinda ill-considered, dumb ass idea Trump would come good day.

In case, Fed shot idea presser right now. Ain't approved ain't manufacturer recommended trialled. Leading vaccine researchers said almost long term side effects would observed 6 weeks. studies least 8 weeks data submitted 2 year study plan Japanese obesity rate 3%, rate obesity USA 35%+. president fixated overturning election instead saving lives. tables haven’t turned.

Sweden’s average excess deaths causes throughout pandemic 2.66 percent neighbor, Finland, hell lot better lot top-down authoritarian approaches.

2.66 percent lot. definitely puts Sweden league rest Nordics world standards.

Not mention nordics took light measures: short light lockdowns, really drug feet masks, compliance low finally implemented them. people praising rest Nordics. dunno still make sense. protecting protecting everyone come contact with. choice? Plenty stupid people China, like USA  wouldn’t unprecedented, [back 70’s, Russia accidentally released anthrax Christian Science Even rollout behind. originally said they'd distribute 20 million doses, half that. localities hospitals reporting they're getting 10-20% expected. Even so, seems like slow-going shots reason. seems common issue moment lol. Don’t worry. Germany discussion. guess countries have. People edge anxious get thing going. delay infuriating. 

I’m sure get onto speed establish bit routine talking about, 700M doses purchased AZ(300M) Pfizer(200M), Moderna(100M), J&amp;J(100M) Oh, well, uh... thanks back. Sorry whole weapons mass distraction disaster Iraq. anti war saw us steamroll everyone it. need stay home. Explore great outdoors, find secluded places wear mask. go shitholes filled idiots. Hospitals extra personnel anything administer hundreds thousands doses month, each.

In case notice, hospitals slammed patients moment already run (for capitalist reasons) without much extra headroom first place. less rigorous process FDA. actual turnaround time similar remarkably quick FDA.

Again, implication seems MHRA somehow better FDA, clearly true I’m wondering far you’re willing take moral relevatism regards human rights freedoms.


Wearing mask - cultural value?

Censorship - cultural value?

Slavery - cultural value? Yeah people don’t care continue care even produced. Also: State Heath orders limit gathering size.

Romans 13: 1-2 (HCSB)

Everyone must submit governing authorities, authority except God, exist instituted God. 2 then, one resists authority opposing God’s command, oppose bring judgment themselves. entirety UK health system making terrible choice? infer make additional decisions based Dara available  Considering it’s 2 weeks since first dose administered US passed 5 million, don’t think we’re going hit number. that’s based week old data, it’ll undercount. There’s still danger could run every time cross street am, crossing streets. much emphasis fact, IMO, instead emphasizing transmissibility especially ""don't feel sick."" Sounds like brothers school working at.  100 million doses purchased different administered. doses even made yet. risk death age 18 probably closer one 100,000 1 million. said SARS, wrong. novel disease. even right, merely guessing wasn’t expert field.

That said, one component story didn’t claim be. didn’t go international press, sent 7 coworkers. Two Quick question. 

So get first vaccine 90% protection follow shot month later. contract vaccines?

Also, heard vaccine effective need least 90 days post illness COVID. asymptomatic carrier, didn’t know it, turn get vaccine within 90 day window? That's normal. Antibody levels decline, body remembers make again, as-yet undetermined period SARS-COV-2. Yeah, fair point. actually get large number millions people recovered COVID, absence evidence eventually become evidence. I'm convinced we're quite yet, though.

There Lancet paper pegged upper bound ""long covid"" around 2-4% cases, reassuringly low. Almost data useless upper bounds (10-30%) meaningless lower bounds. shut everything approach long since passed, friend. Ding ding ding. Finally. Someone who’s speaking sense here. basically take vaccine herd immunity projections scale down. scales world reports mass infections. actually saw model day based current projections uk blowing right now, would reach herd immunity vaccine vaccine mid-late April. 

Everytime see vaccine numbers they’re approaching like coronavirus introduced world yesterday handful people it. UK Virus invaded America. context global pandemic, quicker better long safe effective, MHRA ensured.

A week delay week people dying.... I'm pretty sure stopped counting new disease name Plague Inc pfizer shots come pack 975 doses. working smaller allotments, yet.
I believe moderna 100 per shipment. really hope day 1 announces massive mobilization get done. 

If plans keep promise 100-million 100 days, sure hell isn’t going happen unless something. 

I’m religious thank god Joe Biden replacing incompetent fuck. caught considered immune? caught second time? many suffering ongoing health problems like special education teacher profiled? It’s 1 50-70 chance death you’re tested positive based 20 millions cases states.

1 100-500 applies healthy young individuals.  Yeah fuck it, let’s ignore idiots charge us. could go wrong? analyses contagiousness definitely comparing variants England, presumably generally dominant strains took Europe summer. indeed 70% infectious variant replaced 54% infectious variant summer.

(*) Variant correct term, say strain half time mistake. Maneuvering thrusters. That’s true. EU country free approve vaccine reason didn’t EMA simply faster. 

Germany also placed preliminary orders 5 different companies itself. 

So yes nothing would change Tens millions already US, wouldn’t surprised number close 40 point, saying need 100% immunity see drop cases?  Like vaccine, potential adverse long term effects. However, long term effects actual disease much, much likely (and much likely worse) vaccine. school brothers went never constant attendance last months. Year groups kicked last weeks alone.

Let alone amount staff off. messes schedule learning amongst problems. 

So stupid. hard truths? slaves cut trees like half countries planet.

 point people power getting away stuff happens everywhere. like money. pure pointless rhetoric. Sure did. spend time defending Trump. Seems legit. likely would mutating would mutating transmission lethality. Depending vaccine works targets would determine long vaccine would effective for. Pfitzer one untested schedule

What mean this? That's wrong people also assume still spread covid vaccinated. Right simply know may still able transmit covid may not. gets vote. Looking forward returning normal lifestyle, even wear mask. wife son. way would get opportunity anyway. Unless live Russia China feds experience infrastructure that. vaccinate 40% population flu 3 months every year almost effort via local infrastructure. OMG THANK YOU!!! post meant much back early march. real turning point kind perspective US.

it’s good give platinum.  what's saying is, I'm dumb catching first round Covid serious one way? that's much problem right certain people allowed get vaccine four six months anybody go. I'm arguing rollout issues, said can't assume we're going continue vaccinate slowly now. Nothing perfect look cost benefit analysis. small chance adverse event make chance getting COVID-19?   FDA doesn’t care manufactures vaccine. want proper trial completed (which Feb AZ) want access data trial (which March). U.K. desperate approving vaccine based flawed trial flawed data means force approval EU US. 

Johnson &amp; Johnson next Queue vaccines trials started. options available. Restaurants gyms opening PA next week state covid sub happy. Even expressing slightest amount skepticism shutdowns gets downvoted oblivion there.

I’m convinced could Wuhan-style lockdown majority state regional subs still wouldn’t happy. Both, tv also LOL

Like oligarchs gonna change anything. people going demand change.

Stay complacent, people! Quick summary technicalities:

1. Wednesdays days registers cross-checked find deaths replrted already, meaning Wednesday numbers usually significantly higher average
2. extra large backlog currently due Christmas holidays
3. normal week, Sweden reports new numbers 4 7 days. means reported deaths often higher actual deaths. numbers reported Christmas eve day, meant extra delay reporting.
4. actual number daily deaths currently seem around 60 - 80. high, far 200.

To see trend, recommend would take passage bill do. chances passing zero.  Covid zombies?  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Israel overpaid doses smart. paid even German makes vaccine. calculation done much cost 1 lockdown day, pay instead vaccines. Nursing homes residents 0.6% people, ~45% deaths always ""Christians"" want hurt kill people? want deny criminals healthcare? Tbf onlu started vaccinations 2/3 weeks ago. imagine time progresses we'll see weekly vaccinations significantly ramped up. think also reporting delays etc.  Yea, fascist voted Bernie Sanders primaries. Get fuck lmao cannot give prioritized targets open next group, good arm shelf. want go gym without worrying, want take girl nice dates see things want eat restaurants. can’t everyone us part! explain Asia’s economy especially Taiwan operating normal North America Europe still shambles?! could amazing movie. start old Charles Bronson Death Wish script, throw musical segments inspired Cats, I’d watch it.

A little mink, escaping cull human captors, sick disease human captors, bent revenge animal liberation. pastor two weeks ago. Didn’t even preach sermon. Spent 45 minutes telling us church’s stance COVID. husband said like watching segment Fox News. It’s amazing confident despite wildly ignorant. actually looked up, find congressmen fact front line. aren’t skipping line all. That’s it’s designated. Seriously. need simple Google search you? 

I donate $5 charity choice find article reputable source says Congress isn’t set get shots early design. Please show ignorant am.

Your last sentence really makes question I’m wasting time you. clearly moron. Yes, believe not, leaders country place faith vaccine actually increases public trust. obviously don’t read news articles determined get shots first, would know this, please stop pretending idea “cut line.” Sounds like second wave Spanish flu started taking young people. I've couple dozen last decade, single reaction Hep B shot. also nearly collapsed one sick EXACTLY! Good, lock throw away keys. I'm ok judged negatively fascist. 2nd wave Spanish flu mostly killed younger people (and way first), could new strain? not? Enough unintended consequences majority excess deaths 25-44 year old range Covid SIDRAP, run Michael Osterholm, Biden’s new Covid advisor.

And yes, belief individuals, even group lots imperfect ones, better situated know best need protect well-being facing situations many different types competing risks.

Look Sweden. looks like disaster look Covid numbers. 8.6 times Covid deaths per capita neighbor, Finland, lauded response. compare excess deaths causes, Sweden seen 2.66 percent excess deaths Finland.

Scandinavia general lauded outcomes. mostly left citizens, kept lockdowns light brief global standards, fewer less strict restrictions opening back places. Even bringing mask mandates, late game, compliance much lower America many local mask mandates heavier lockdowns generally top-down restrictions.

Here unintended consequences personal experiences:

I know someone starved death due nursing home quarantine.

In town, food bank close liquor store head shop next door never to. sure wasn’t intentional. government -- Canada -- wants increase number people significantly reduce -- good economy.  nature destroyed -- wealth gap increased significantly gap based property ownership inherited property income. sure green party going long way getting even minority government Canada. There's discussion had. Get vaccinated. Eh, knew getting into, setting example going rehab. even downvoted thats literally works transport. UPS FedEx get package Miami North Dakota overnight to. 

They capable getting vaccine location needed. 

The issue ""last mile"" journey arm patient. That's hospitals job, without lack good planning last mile worst part. Someone doesn’t like hearing hard truths Yeah relative frontline still hospital tons doses since frontline way get someone doesn’t show appointment already drew dose. Nah, I'm sure spray tan mushroom stamp face. Ahh yes surplus vaccine really buy that? That’s story hospital came save face. **GET VACCINE**. Well production governments hands. That's manufacturer fast get doses made. Governments can't control fast pfizer oxford etc make doses. always known fact. doses country ordered delivered several batches throughout next months once. yes initially we'll limited doses end next year doses ordered already delivered. Perhaps US Canada rely much AstraZeneca, EU does. remember October seeing news first doses member states due end year. almost Covid Relief funds given sacrifice upward wealth transfer. would never get courts “force” hospitals vaccinate people  would explain they're afraid vaccines. unlucky 1 10,000,000? May covid get me, since 99% get alive I'm Gen X too.

No one asking people give youth. far tell, everyone age 25 spends 75% time phone anyway. stay fuck inside months. That's all. JFC. Thanks correction conspiracy theory stupid plenty highly virulent, worse diseases already exist nature. hard vaccinate 1a, start vaccinating everyone? Give vaccine 1a day. Unused doses give 1b another day. Unused 1b give everyone else  Im saying needs months trials know tue long term side effects.

It months trials. Pfizer trials began July. explained trials using mRNA vaccines many Im saying technology never released a. public medicine millions people.

No medication commercially released public released public! doesn’t make sense reason it! really don’t see you’re getting this?!

Look, understand people who’s sole role evaluate whether vaccines, medication, safe use? spend many years studying this, years experience exact field, basing opinions collective knowledge research mankind centuries? criteria place long anyone even heard Covid-19, followed *every one* criteria meticulously here, albeit things happened faster rate. *The speed never one criteria.*

No medication without risk, nothing without risk. job people ensure risk levels acceptable, medication exceeds reasonable risk levels, withhold approval.

I suspended downvoted - hope spoken concerns put context. vaccine effective post infection, really effective vaccine. vaccine effective infection since clinical trial excluded person prior COVID-19 infection detectable antibodies prior immunization. Good point. after-effects seem anywhere weeks months ""no sign going away nearly year (and may lifelong).""

There's ton research happening. 6 months year may much better understanding causes long-term symptoms COVID-19. may (or may not) develop ways prevent sick treat (for people who've already sick). 

But right minute, clear absolute best thing avoid risk is: catch COVID-19, try ensure people around catch it. Mask always outside house, keep distance people, wash hands, avoid large gatherings, etc sad story here. Hopefully vaccines roll wider numbers soon.

Though distinguish people truly anti-vaccine general &amp; people merely hesitant getting particular one (who normally get prior vaccines people typically get)? deadline people must get by? Like end 2021 something? Say fine getting vaccine feel anxious getting say April 1st, following pandemic rules even wearing mask outdoors &amp; guests over. I'm medical/essential worker &amp; well age 65, early priority lists. 2 societies little people vaccine go mask-free &amp; people yet get required continue masking up? continue mask well getting vaccine happen feel comfortable public way year (especially winter)? Fun start 2021. Minimum 1 month lockdown Even though would warranted since men face 1.5X death risk. course. remember well last batch guys hero fared 70+ years ago. America, all. country worth proud of. wait actually release data, knows actually accurate, mean said several different numbers throughout past weeks. RNs grow trees? US faced major nursing shortages covid. Tell could staff ICUs without magically cloning RNs? No, review process botched (that would russia...) process well oiled lots back channelling ""your"" company, opposed not. think 500,000 moment we? mean fine start one said anything else! Here's parts anger -- first we've got city official saying coming Fremont Street Experience question city was: going prepare fact people coming?” said Wesley Harper, executive director Nevada League Cities, spoke behalf Las Vegas. “If they’re going come, let’s things try make responsible possible.”

Which *almost* makes sense... we've got guy pulling implored officials view event “protest” couldn’t stopped without violating First Amendment. said $25 cost wasn’t tickets, “service fee” subsidize cost necessary law enforcement.

Keep mind city mayor [offered constituents test keep city running normal pandemic.  U.S. well past 500,000 vaccines given. Good. Maybe US follow add testing requirement here. started working home find sufficient needs, want go bars, restaurants etc. 

I agree sub nuts glued news 24/7 havent gone outside walk since march. Eww imagine amount typical health violations could happening restaurants right now. Guess didn’t read Twilight Yeah open tray use all. don’t know aren’t running 24/7 giving leftover doses whoever wants come 11pm get last trays. got mine 15 minutes ago! guess european country bet it? fucking country. got things still want vaccine most. playing invite parties several hours.  Assholes, behavior get people killed...

""Casinos located tribal lands obligated follow state county COVID rules. such, Gov.

The trial registered (designed set points) assess different dosing schedule. part it.

As far timeline - Pfizer Moderna issues despite working difficult technology. JNJ going either. Seriously fuck off. 
Its fucking mask. tiny piece fabric. handle wearing tiny piece fabric, get triggered, maybe part society, go way, whatever morons calling days. I’m laid right COVID, really tough mines pretty mild. can’t imagine poor girl experienced. time get 230million vaccinated, less everybody who's gotten point lost antibodies disease. also assuming nobody falls categories. intend also giving Pfizer vaccine 12 weeks apart. idea efficacy single dose (unlike AZ seemed tested longer gap) since trial test that. mayor supposed turn power? know? “fun” important health society?

Staying home binge watching shows, playing video games, facetiming friends family absolutely “fun”. absolutely plenty time fun future getting stuff need focus present.

People don’t self control seems... Reportedly even filed approval EU yet. strange. I'm sure great comfort dead families. want leave homes. stay forever that's want. can't keep insisting everyone else same. vaccine. might heard them. There’s reason believe immunity won’t lifelong unless virus mutates significant way, far hasn’t.

We still use measles vaccine 1960s it’s still effective measles virus today. ""Casinos located tribal lands obligated follow state county COVID rules. such, Gov.

Crucial dystopia crave. smart, wear mask, cognizant other's personal space, wash hands.

Gloves safety goggles locking panic room fucking sad. UK’s government silly announcement taunting British Ingenuity big clue (just like tried claim Moderna). fact trial insufficient FDA telling. one knows effective vaccine proper dosage screwed trial protocols. public information. get that, wave Union Jack front folks, people get mesmerized ignore flawed data science. US already vaccinated 5x per capita canada. people break restrictions. tell people “it sucks give things love, can’t replace over” would received way people creating new normals really gotten point anyone says “you’re spreading misinformation” one spreading misinformation. 

Every post fact based numbers gets downvoted ratio’s shit. 

Every post emotional story statistically anomalous death gets 50k upvotes. 

This sub something else man. understanding mutations surface proteins allow effective invading human cells. would expect would also progress faster within body also. sure would less lethal this. 

These surface proteins used vaccine trigger immune response. change, vaccine would need updated. flu shot updated annually reason. basically Crazies fact remains still failure every delay means death. We're 3000 deaths day hitting record infections. need vaccines. 

If house fire fire trucks arrived bucket water, like ""ok patience"", upset house fire fire department taking forever. Anyone going one parks: you’re selfish feel responsible spread disease outrageous number deaths we’ve seen country. You’re responsible this. Hope sleep well night. **It’s false feel-good message tailored group people feel important everyone else** 

That's every church religious belief general. Saving environment too! I’m effective home TF aggregate box downtown year 2021. thing is, cases, deaths hospitalizations guaranteed shoot things open. It’s pretty much guaranteed people vaccinated. real personal opinion lockdowns I’m lucky enough doesn’t really affect me. it’s shameful people risk health middle pandemic put food table. reality people around other, virus spread. everyone wants though mean seriously started 2 weeks ago, Christmas New Years. know it’s scary thought going drag think January things ramp up, (in US) hopefully new administration work get things moving faster, vaccines come market, many vaccinations done. think 2 million + 2 weeks holiday isn’t terrible (I know far cry 20 million “promised”) think new year get going faster even close point. even ballpark. It’s less deadly. It’s much contagious. think downvoted telling people stay home, underplaying people’s need outdoor social interaction.

You act YouTube substitute going amusement parks friends Hope get covid...but do, I'm hoping severe.

I'm scared. modicum caution warranted. churches indoctrination centers. Thank you! understand correctly 70% difference unvaccinated vs vaccinated

Say 100 vaccinated 100 unvaccinated, 10 unvaccinated people got covid 3 vaccinated would get covid. mega-church leader, David Jeremiah, comes work (retail) regular awful person. He’s also wealthy, pro-Trump, tells followers vote for, “masks suggested required” policy church, full bigotry preaches end world craziness. 

And people lap up. maybe...not me. Staying home much possible exception necessities crucial.

Judge want, don’t really care tbh. Exactly. database people psychotic episodes, never hospitalized. Maybe start staying fuck home. Yes. Republican-backed “three-martini lunch deduction” doubles existing tax break, allowing companies write 100% business dining expenses 2022. loophole’s defenders say supports hard-hit restaurant “a pro-worker, pro-restaurant, pro-small business bill,” said U.S. Senator Tim Scott South However, derided economists, Democrats, even staunchly conservative Wall Street Journal op-ed page politically tone deaf, given millions sick out-of-work Americans. tax break cost taxpayers $6.3 billion 2023, analysis congressional committee shows also fail boost restaurant industry big way, least “When less 10% workers returned offices Midtown Lower Manhattan, indoor dining closed it’s freezing outside, deduction doesn’t much,” said Andrew Rigie, director New York City Hospitality Alliance.”

Bernie outspoken this. Democrats want funding shit important, republicans want breaks already Uber rich. Yes read thanks. also *comprehend*, whereas pedantic sake fragile ego. Can't arsed playing game, knock out. military experience mass vaccination campaign. infrastructure usual channels deploy millions doses day, like flu season. holdup federal government directing flow dosages states. 

All traditional vaccination channels arms Trump talking using military vaccinate people. simply would work. there's also reason it. that's kinda point! extreme eye beholder. half country voted guy said shit like this! 25 year old higher risk exposure. Though near 0% chance needing hospitalization Covid. 65 year old hand much higher chance needing go hospital. no, stopping spread equally important. Right now, stopping deaths hospitalizations number 1 priority. It’s quote spelled said! Hush hush.

Covid terrible every one us. ask lock year. maybe 2 years, fur measure.

And even suggesting people great risk, hand, others might put health danger making stupid decision.. that's terrible you! TERRIBLE!! Could be! Take em anti mask people. China style. haven’t released data That’s textbook example herd immunity action! mean, could go digging, I’m saying healthcare provider who’s patients myocarditis. What? Yeah really need stick looking numbers put Europe better light dying hospital room much better? wouldn’t efficient bc people wouldn’t it. Secular charities don’t well- well demonstrated.

Source? vaccine tested China, dude ffs.

They tested multiple countries none reported serious conditions. countering point. pointing typical double standard Muricans apply trash-talking nations shit do. Murica never did/does nothing wrong! /s Pre-COVID, 1/4th people behind bars pretrial. 

470k 2.1 million. So, like entire population Anchorage. roll absolute fucking joke. always count hit copium NYT.  Cases go lightened restrictions. what's evidence decision MHRA made today based nationalism rather data. Oxford run large clinical trials past 8 months lots data showing safety effectiveness. That's decision made today. Yeah true except one thing, novel coronavirus E. coli that’s dumb comparison.

Also blaming China. doesn’t mean useless puppet organization whose statements equally useless. I'm also California resident. wife struggling hard-core. received UI gave ring around months essentially saying ""Sorry, overloaded UI going happen"". stay inside part go alot. However we've lockdowns shutdowns 0 results plan us.. I'm fed mental health great either. Would amount acceptable stop bitching? Yup. feel bad them. One 8th grade, 12th. They've remote almost year now, social aspect taking toll. US side winter peak? John Hopkins Worldometers show pretty sharp decline cases, peak appearing December 19th.

I wonder dip hold out, Christmas mingling late reporting see rise way back again?

Also clearly March/April US surge. haven’t experienced COVID Jan-March since establishing then. think we’d see another new peak centered around March dip Jan-Feb? choice. Self-autonomy. Maybe. may take longer get better data fatality take weeks even months hospitalization patients die, could potentially affect different populations differently (ethnicity, age, etc.) give doctors discretion give needed severe cases young folks, get old folks done first.  So, trick (for deadlier 2nd wave) Spanish flu WW1 what's trick people stupid (and globalisation). Right? Indiana, got mine yesterday! .2% coronavirus .02 flu

It's difference 1/500 1/5,000. That's trivial amount.

I get saying, still unlikely, we're still talking factor 10. flu still good comparison. shit. don’t want it’s sitting freezer I’ll take sure you’re saying Recently took Rapid Sofia Covid-19 Antigen Flu &amp; B Combo. error rate they've conducted tests? Can't find anything online. Wondering twice case. US one highest salaries RNs world. Turning nurses public employees certainly help increasing nurse salaries. Increasing capacity train nurses CCs important that's government's job certainly short run solution. here. remember work talking coworker didn’t understand crazy basically shut lunar new year. people truly following going details rather sparse west anyways. 

Little know long would waking every morning first thing I’d checking previous days deaths New York City. Meal write offs? Yeah obviously 70% better nothing able get many vaccines possible goal, especially considering many poor countries world much help need rolling makes sense. Heck, I'd take $300-400 too. Yo. covid July already anxiety full nervous breakdown sick. stigma fear mongering joke. lost seven pounds anxious eat. took months mentally feel less edge. case extremely mild. know I'm anecdote, agree you. fucking sad...  That's fair, think going difficult try manage queue-jumping question hard states going work see they're facing bottlenecks.

Age fairly easy. Announce timelines advance age group (to modified based demand) require people show driver's license. sort appointment system ensure people suffering outside hours ideal.

But trying screen essential workers pre-existing conditions going really tough I've seen little discussion announced priority framework. could go doctors office ensure medical history require pay stubs provided advance, someone review 25%+ Americans even regular doctor suspect non-trivial number vulnerable workers easy access paystubs.

On level, vulnerable populations vaccinated (hospital workers/very elderly/institutionalized), important get vaccines door get right people getting right people means slowing distribution. unclear states find palatable.

It may end best hold back percentage doses go doctor's office (for pre-existing conditions) work states largest employers percentage loosen requirements doses. dosing schedule tested data delaying space first second dose - hence decision. idea clinical trials pandemic always go smoothly reality - ultimately developed effective vaccine 11 months deserve credit. Worst. Poem. Ever Imagine bat shit crazy post implies.

My God people joke Liberalism disease read stuff like realize actually true. certainly continue strict PPE work, social distancing/ masking public, least brings piece mind I’m less likely pick unknowingly spread others.  6,000? great! live Colorado phase two. I've missed day work occasional PTO mental health. may cry get notified number come vaccine. would stay away people least 3 weeks. Even symptoms, probably asymptomatically spread it. Please kill grandma. worries. Try take personally like want help full caseloads list people needing services long unfortunately. Hopefully way truly stuck inside months longer. still 112 active cases according article, herd immunity protective yet even 80% infected. good thing Bloomberg tracker shows we're 4 million allocations away allocating vaccines group 1A (24m people). wonder could see pharmacies opening 65s end January Yeah, he's jumped bandwagons - like Moon Landing Hoax conspiracy theories, COVID-19 bullshit. course, always backs realizes he's pissed many people. think Novavax might also soon? He’s clarified depends vaccination factors change gradually. I’m sure hard understand. Holy fuck.

A month ago 12,330 daily cases. deaths today people got sick around beginning December, deaths happen around 3-4 weeks illness.

What fuck going happen month 50,000 cases day still increasing....

And strain states.

Why don’t people realize absolutely fucked we’re Burnt Chrysler even hard name get right. wtf guys. saying inconvenience able go favourite bar outweighs lives old people fat people?

Must really good bar. government worked closely companies developing vaccines ensure minimal bureaucratic delays assessing evidence approval rolling quickly efficiently risk.

Medical personal generally risk-adverse, first groups completed, no-one going vaccinate others, get blamed jumping gun.

Widespread use n95 masks would far effective putting stop it. claiming masks way go long term, likes wearing masks? year, great way tens thousands additional avoidable fatalities rely solely vaccines otherwise throw caution wind. Confirmed cases account 6% population.

Unconfirmed cases mostly get vaccinated antibody tests vaccinating slow already struggling process. (That's without even considering feasibility 250M antibody tests next 3-6 months)

Even relatively high unconfirmed cases (say 30% population) add single digit percentages total immune population get 70%-85% range. sub says, ""Rule #4: Avoid politics"". Pretty hard complete moron like DeSantis charge state. charged criminal neglect.

I remember several months ago saying reporting COVID cases deaths. bunch dumbass Floridians came hard me. 

I dare one take shot now. would agree Trump used executive order move money around (like wall) it’s possible find way. love quote interpreted optimistic pessimistic, entire article could said ""US return normal mid summer Dr Fauci said"". hate negative articles better clicks.

People quite angry this. example nothing stopping already vaccinating hospital workers - easy keep track 'IT systems' arguments nonsense. right. don't. know short term effects vaccine vs short term effects covid. That's easy choice. man made idiot. 1 billion Americans next year? wait bbc reporting 8 old month study lol? article makes seem like released? huh, guess this, something similar, never knew call it

It’s something need order progress. freedom speech isnt freedom consequence , got info needed based fact depserately mentioned countries asked ungrateful US, ""YEAH COUNTRIES"" mention entirely US vaccine moderna ,was first one ever used EU great Britain now. notice havent mentioned once. would rather talk germany US undermines reddit hivemind ""yeah fuck trump never get vaccine year haha!""

Yeah. fit right in. Oh OK, what's difference? got vaccine doses. What's difference? issue paraded sort experiment taking vaccine ""first time."" first. watched getting flu vaccine last year. asked ever one, said no, made sit 30 minutes. want go back work though.  original person responded made point someone “driving” somewhere. I’m sure you’re even referring ? also never said WONT feel it. probably look back comments think you’re probably trolling one stupid case I’m wrong. 

[""I feel fine now, pain arm minimal, actually,"" said.  mRNA vaccines enough vulnerable population would end pandemic.

Oh mistake, think easy things. Aside anti-vcxx parents, segments population still recall people communities used, abused killed medical research without consent. tough come back that. 

It help knowing people, including current administration supporters wishing dead relishing demise. 

The administration literally telling people wear masks public served essential workers. clear regard certain lives. easy us say, trust us time. They're ones burned trusting others hurt them.

Can't ways. Hopefully impossible rebuild trust new administration. good!! Keep record carrying lethal virus 🦠 study used biased sample bc trying detect early cases, figuring infection rate. one conducted back April remember Chinese sources stratified sample, representative entire local population time. I'll post source find 8 months Wait, guys build vaccination centers? ""It's unexpected all. work numbers, exactly we’d expect happen someone exposed,"" said Dr. Christian Ramers, infectious disease specialist Family Health Centers San Diego.

... vaccines immediate immunity. Lol auto industry horrible it’s become necessity every day life. can’t give stuff like easily. realistic remember real enemies issues like thinking too. Also they're 
not likely friends anyone traditionally traveled vacationed recently, likely around kids know social distance, probably family spend holidays birthdays with. 

I'd like see numbers homeless death rate compared usual, think would tell us accurate count actually is. they're isolating get sick depressive going die kind way, might showing kinds surveys sick yeah? really sure makes Texas's numbers acceptable. Getting 10% getting 40% test failing grades. Hey, j finally found someone passed out, then! one signed basically jail time years. least committing crimes accept possibility giving years life. owe you, random stranger, years life. 

At certain point becomes personal responsibility. scared/super at-risk, hide bunker. Otherwise live life, nothing's certain. Don’t spoil anti-US circlejerk Idk. Japan like low testing capacity, high positive rate keep long time without overwhelming hospital. seems like actually living it. sure. I'm taking vaccine instant comes available, hesitation. ah good bet federal government, near tell, permanent state war counterfeiters US dollar. conservatives imposed state balanced budget restriction every state Vermont.

You go war army have. politicians devolved nearly entire power deal federal government. stop posting stories prey uninformed engineered get clicks there’s nothing unusual here. built full immunity second dose, even second dose get covid, much unlikely long curbside pickup taking public transportation, exactly problem? one things person really could without seeing all, form, imo exactly like London announced new variant. friends/colleagues noticed shift way thing spreading, come lockdown 2.0 yet many people still getting sick. reminded beginning again, spreading unchecked. Lies. Knowing Russia numbers probably far worse reporting. promised Easter Miracle. Given TRUMPS failure deliver perfectly fair relentlessly destroy chance now. gave entire retirement home one dose per person, would approaching herd immunity. half second dose, functionally herd immune. literally drive across Israel hour. Israel’s health system crazy efficient. 
There 4 big insurance companies compete every citizen, get money state per patient, need please citizens, easily switch private companies, fierce competition, country wide coverage clinics(from socialist era), high % doctors society, amount medical research resulted 8th highest life expectancy world (while state war decades, around failed states). 🙏🏾 Dear NYT, China already least two vaccines approved emergency use vaccinated millions people. really hire competent journalists. Could apply one 3/4s US states. We’re ending 2020 quite strong. Let’s go!!! article, shows “...are extending holiday hiatus one week...” get ton shots kids pretty much stops age 9. point get repeater/booster shot diphtheria, tetanus polio, mumps, rubella measles. girls, believe there's HPV vaccine they're around 12/13. I've heard vaccinations universities. really dorms like do, maybe vaccinating certain diseases makes sense ton people living close quarters? 

Yeah, chicken pox sucks. actually part vaccination program Netherlands, either. basically kids get chicken pox point (usually they're 5). considered ""serious"". daughters got one actually got twice, rare, happens. felt really bad them... 53 samples would plenty detect big changes proportions strains assuming samples randomly selected. Even pretty bad sampling 0 53 exclude strain major driver high infection rate. actual proportion population tested relevant terms statistical significance. Hopefully efficient roll could done spring  great news really hope results really pushing faster 🤞 Lol Florida looks like peanus  Oh FFS - conspiracy theorists.....it news week would approved shortly. good thing! mRNA Cell production still protein years after?

I parse that. Could rephrase? Meaning hunt corona virus scapegoat. China never tell world really happpened dictatorship suppresses free expression. No, principle approve approved vaccines, sorry. Hydroxichloroquine suggested in-silico (by software) potential treatment COVID US government ran it. less month already proven anything even made things worse.

The vaccination data pretty strong can't explained chance Pfizer's Moderna's lowest 95% confidence interval points 80%. avoiding symptomatic infection. need lockdown COVID transmissible relatively high IFR, especially elder people. eliminate one factors, done vaccinating everyone 50, yes, around 1 2% people died due COVID age group still die probably around 2-4% go hospital, literally turns COVID something less deadly flu, even get people 50 vaccinated, they're extremely unlikely die COVID

So EVEN vaccine reduces 0% transmission (which even vaccine directly protect transmission itself, since truly asymptomatic transmission rare), deaths reduced 80 95% vaccinating significantly less half population US EU owned libs though, alright. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I've come across quite bit anecdotal evidence methamphetamine potent protective nature regards COVID. form surprisingly low infection rates among meth users whose change social patterns stopped going mass gatherings (since banned) -- socialize indoors many others one wears masks, yet none caught COVID. also friend got infected (he drugs time), acquired late day 2 symptoms; reported symptoms ended almost immediately first dose come back. 

The cartels organize clinical trial - publicity stunt... It’s probably good business. can’t imagibe businesses hey rely customer interaction (marketing firms, salesmen’s) benefited lack personal touch truly feel cavalry competency coming. incoming administration actually functioning something. Even moderate lockdown/ shutdown would help, something cut virus tracks people regroup and/ slow spread. happened flattening curve? Everybody decided like sharp inclines/ spikes? I'd say developing computer far useful output WWII. I’ve never monitored vaccine. anyone know happens second booster shot given late? ""Hello Governor! Yes millions vaccines ready. Nope giving per federal guidelines, please get line!""

This powerful Governor is.

It's fucking incomprehensible FEMA ran facilities already deployed across nation waiting vaccines roll out. year put kind plan place! almost population whole EU

Yeah that's kind point, thanks. huge population, hence ordering vaccines literally given chance yeah see would rather praise countries literally nothing world

Additionally, say I'd rather praise countries nothing world? said vaccine, Pfizer ***and BioNTech*** vaccine, joint effort included U.S. ***and*** Germany. think BioNTech scientists sat back dabbing fucking around?

And ***you*** know would rather solely praise countries? I'm proud country right, vaccine progress Pfizer helped contribute, I'm proud of. I'm proud administration handled pandemic, including ordering vaccines population chance, mean hate country lol. original comment joke somehow took way seriously even though clearly marked sarcasm. classic reddit shit people saving lives

I'm sorry, shitting Pfizer, people literally saving lives? doctors distributing them? ungrateful people shouldnt aloud get it.

Kind goes point vaccinating entire population, okay, get vaccine fuck whole freedom speech thing whatever. ""American"" you.

*allowed, way. Florida right. understand, whats point vaccinating? heard already vaccines, sit storages? give people risk/health care workers? Science always wins. love humanity's ability progress times disaster. I've run numbers EU, definitely possible either AZ/Oxford approved March. CureVac coming well. Maybe JJ.   Better version song Grocery stores essential. work sporting goods store would ok curbside only, would still classify us essential workers. like us fully open luckily we've handling well. one tested positive work, people gotten outside work infected coworkers. People working what's causing spread, going see people without masks on. Nah racist af don’t think anyone thinks guy real doctor. He’s tv personality. Yep, gave lots them.

Some came senses don’t give shit, races including Chinese folks west zzzzzz Yeah hoping late February approval latest. Kind disappointing Let's hope vaccine game changer hoping can't last another 1 year this.  know one looks data interprets ""like flu"" anyone age 15. link provided, even 15-24 age group shows 468 deaths involving COVID-19, compared 55 involving influenza. doctor tells people ""It's flu"" deserve it. No. never recommendation **against** masks. fucking mutants.. amazing cool everyone life ending. think days, weeks, 70% effectiveness 1 shot would certainly lot simpler easier 2 shots. FYI, first dose 70% effective 22 days Oxford vaccine announced today. Overall effectiveness may lower 22 days COVID then, 70%. Unsure breakdown rest data approval based evidence analysed MHRA. 

Also many vaccines effective longer periods boosters. good, help supply especially first dose sufficiently effective. upvotes  Fuck China!! would disagree. It’s case lack clarity observation better vaccines. new strain people getting worried 60% effective vaccine may enough coworker got recovered thinks big deal people know outdoor meetup thing summer. Meaning that, followed guidelines guy proposed, Summer 2021 would literally different Summer 2020, even mass vaccination near completion death numbers cratered.

It’s crazy people put zero stock resorting normal social economic activity. thing me, shot (but 2nd 3 doses). also passed tetanus shot might get flu shot doctor immediately freaked That's overall chance dying COVID age groups combined. teenager much less 1%. 2 kids jumping roof analogy flawed. Someone *might* jump roof die alcohol poisoning, yes, teens would still go scenario. Oh, perfect!! Thank you! tried searching something like kept getting exhaustive reports and/or ads. looked one attack vector. compared spread variants new variant period time. 50-55% number difference spread groups. method compensate factors already know effect number cases. obviously wrong. seen reports saying believe vaccinations handle new strains. sure conclusive yet though, would broad study. 60+hrs week office job getting paid 37.5 unacceptable illegal.

Ha! Welcome life buddy, that's going anywhere. really surprising, UK approval always going least couple months ahead places. movie won’t blockbuster hit. 1.8 million outliers. Enjoying denial? It’s actually higher. experiencing symptoms, roughly third experience long covid, regardless age. don’t want countries failed miserably despite warnings held responsible? Answer this. stop many early part month vs. end month? many LA vs. Bay Area Sacramento? many right next academic labs? We're surrounded assholes. It’s US posters, UK people quite dissatisfied vaccine well know soon. CDC website update today Sure, capacity, want actually put people vaccines rolling out? 

As explicitly stated:none say covid threat young. know enough long-term effects, personally going take risks. trying say (relatively) young never going hospitalized huge numbers seeing today population agree see restrictions gradually diminished circumstances restrictions indoor activities last go. 

Once hospitals enough capacity, think justifiable keep restaurants completely closed indoor dining, state doing. point, becomes personal choice/risk (which *not* today). still dine indoors myself, though. hopefully people reckless think little chance hospitalized case.

They do, objectively, little chance hospitalized though. Especially college-aged younger. argument fail convince people people see numbers see quite unlikely end hospital unbelievably unlikely die. think argument long-term effects much, much stronger one actually know long-term effects prevalence is. Basically get sick virus.

Whether still transmit virus someone else vaccinated still open question believe. Fauci given straight answer it. seems like large hurdle places like CVS/Walgreens. 

It be. roughly 20k walgreens CVS stores US. including doctors offices, walmart pharmacies, places like Kroger offer vaccines, etc. 

Just walgreens CVS them, would need around 150 people per store per day. Going 9am-9pm would 12.5 people per hour. get 6 going time could easily 3x per hour. minutes getting things ready, seconds jab, 15 minutes waiting. 

Adding places place really needs average around like 8 people per day hit goal. don’t think he’s full “it’s hoax” believe “lockdowns bullshit” guy Banned meaningless word one enforcing expect seems high. someone understand fact whole year, think understand time? Loveline legit great radio program!

educated lot young'uns shit probably never would learned 

Both kinda rich assholes now, fan either frankly. show back day good shit medical laboratory staff ""all other"" category? look definition outlier won’t. Companies recruit poach competitors. Salaried professionals aren’t unskilled laborers easily retrained new factory job trade. There’s professional experience, achievements eduction involved. Maybe shift happens decade it’s like entire offices competitive Industries based major cities getting outsourced call center middle nowhere. Someone call Oprah. second shipment arrives mid January gonna start different groups higher risk (people 60 certain medical issues) well police armed forces teachers (hoping teachers vaccinated start normal school year march). course vaccine mandatory, open rest population higher priority want take go (at time get oxford chinese ones). mean failed world initially, still don’t give shit despite early warnings (especially lockdown whole cities) proceed keep using racist shits Chinese Poetic justice still justice. 35% hospitalized, regardless age, long covid. anthrax vaccine? Wtf? 2021: year makes say, “2020 wasn’t bad all.” also evidence people infected vaccinated *can* spread virus. Different types vaccines tend give immunity different lengths. Think dog needs rabies shot every couple years get MMR shot kid never worry again. mRNA vaccines new don’t currently know long immunity confer tends last yet. OG podcast, basically. can't break world without successful, bud  recommending masks occasions? already fucking Italy March, closed borders then. fact knew little spreads treat exactly downplaying profoundly stupid. every reason believe dangerous though, think it’s almost self-loathing Americans tbh friend got Moderna could true cases yeah. wild places dosages expected everything waste meanwhile Florida, seniors camping cold risking covid slight chance vaccination. feel like must’ve already here. CA massive explosion cases unlike anything we’ve seen. Perhaps strain work there. I'm sure case, given UK going sharp peak sensible allow longer gap first second doses. one receiving first went hospital 12 days would absolutely provide good protection 'better nothing' scenario. huge loveline fan. one day called legit situation boyfriend. ridiculed air hung on. felt like shit! Exactly. right here. I’m grateful it, there’s good chance I’ll personally pass shot. ingredient vaccine itself, sudden shock injected anything flu shot sends body fight flight would love see analysis. cases concentrated small % population. US, less 1% population nursing homes 40% cases are. 15% population 65 80% fatalities are. seems like need vaccinate right 5-10% population make big difference. I'm impressed vaccinate people sitting cars. That's pragmatic acting countries lacking. really can’t push effort states without support. ridiculous.

Reinfections incredibly rare. would seeing tons reinfections immunity last. OK, think I'm getting closer. people vaccinated either placebo real vaccine tested positive COVID *after* 3 weeks... 70% placebo 30% vaccine... positive folks? true, I’m glad ignorant fact now. liked loveline back day I’m going keep thinking two never changed. Someone pointed issue athletes average use steroids, also inflaming properties, pre-Covid heart scan dangerous assumption make. doubt Covid causes heart problems (in fact, many viruses cause heart inflammation, since Covid worse flu, rate issues probably higher flu), athletes non-average population people. Projected dates vaccination proprieties are:

**Phase 1:** December - February

* Healthcare workers
* Long-term care facilities 
* Essential workers

**Phase 2:** February - April

* High-risk individuals 
* Early education 
* K-12 65+

**Phsee 3:** April - June

* General public Exactly! love delusional fucks think going good coming this.

I don’t believe lab capable making virus like scratch. Taking existing virus priming exposing human lung cells entirely possible difficult unfortunately.

Nowhere articles refute virus cultured. need evidence data that.

The fact couple differences fact speaks point. could naturally occurring. don’t know. one China China. least apologized. much respect talk show docs like him, anyone willing publicly change opinion like alright book. far worse flu many cases, even 40s. dropping dead mean dangerous. 

There long term effects, risks infection clots. personally know 32yo lost sight one eye. really think Drew doesn’t many redeemable qualities either. Unless exploitation redeemable quality. That’s exactly he’s saying, he’s super qualified say it. Exact same. Really liked loveline. Can’t stand either today. comparing US prison system...pretty wild man Again, people think rich famous authorities every subject? “I’ll call data points don’t like outliers ignore them” That’s true. 60% deaths come 75+ group 80% 65+. Without consideration comorbidities eliminate 4 5 deaths getting arms 16% oldest people. US ordering vaccine lack clarity it’s good. It’s going approved while. US placing much larger order Pfizer Moderna vaccines. let's say sample 1000 people, 500 get placebo 500 get vaccine.

In placebo group 50 people get symptoms COVID.

In vaccine group 15 people get symptoms COVID.

You would 70% efficacy there.

Captain Obvious here. :) Sorry, factually incorrect it? spot disease?  mean, moving fast enough, states arent keeping up, warp speed likely hit 20 million vaccines distributed states end year, states arent great job distributing 20 million given vaccines people. even worse - 'it's real, worry go regular routine. might die it, I'll access much better medical care fine, please fuck investments trying stay alive.'  Haha nazis. many Jews banished Arab lands? many Arabs banished Israel. 

Your thinly veiled attempt hiding anti semitism obvious. country standards for. 

Fuck face Seems plausible states well others not. heard state officials complain funding bottleneck. thing? Man, thought going quote Fauci someone got end. Spot on. Again, falling pointless rathole fatality statistics.

Yes rarer younger cohorts COVID kill important factors pandemic consider like younger cohorts superspreaders due asymptomatic spread poor behavior. Well originally thought virus actually came market animal gave people, rather someone brought virus spread dozens people. said, it’s primary reason. implies it’s reason. Greetings London - Wuhanic strain 49 remember thinking end February “Oh, it’s bad. bad media says, government would international travel protect us”. Yeah, really naïve.

In March talking family friend doctor (this hit city) said things getting really bad need take seriously. trust uneducated random person internet that’s realized it’s bad. I’m ready. Let’s go vivid memory mid-February. standing doorway manager's office work, telling shit go seriously downhill US hundreds thousands people would die. laughed me. referring phase 3 trials. three points made initial comment response phase 3 trials. Astrazeneca running trial anywhere similar Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J running theirs. would critique ran single trial came back said vaccine 60% effective. high Pfizer Moderna, still huge roll entire world. critiquing repeatedly throw different efficacy rates based different dosages, intervals, etc., indicates well run phase 3 trial. Without well run phase 3 trial, cannot say confidence effective vaccine dosage interval. Hopefully ran US 30k participant trial better concrete data soon. Fuck hypocrites Oh man they'll never time make TikToks answer proper logistic planning difficult involved thing one put time money it. lol actually stupid would guessed cohesive federal covid response would caused this?

Oh, expert, that's knew. ...he’s psychiatrist. He’s medical doctor. MD. He’s practicing medical doctor almost 40 years. knows you. doubt, spun ""you get time family! commute!"" job that's already happening. 

Likewise, here's hoping something better, best yours. US ordered lot it’s cheaper billed effective vaccine. data released they’re focusing getting Pfizer/Moderna etc Austria start January 12. received vaccines lying freezer. Why? sure, holidays guess.

(yes, vaccinated 6000 people mainly make photos) one thing I’m happy Costco, they’ve taken bunch pallets built wall outdoor lunch/break room employees. fuck man year, wear damn mask already people

&amp;#x200B;

not sure long last like Don’t dramatic. even read wrote? Everyone deserves treated dignity. comment. Still, healthy obese. there’s big difference obesity, changed, skin color. Seems likely caused isolation COVID brings on. catch virus essentially go contact everyone 2 weeks may low contact likely low contact after. Humans evolved around social structure. proven solitary confinement form torture. increase mental health issues due quarantines. Virus physically causing stretch me. Boyfriend asshole size mason jar. joke. know take seriously. Hopefully indeed Awww touch nerve...being anti Israel make one antisemite fuck Israel sure learned Nazis way handling Palestine situation... must anti Muslim!!!! Hopefully go major science know dangers science illiterate.  federal response abysmal accident - Donald Trump, Lindsey Graham several Republican Senators compromised Russian SVR actively best make virus response bad possible, literally logical conclusion look timeline actions.


Remember: Russia released emails hacked DNC release single email RNC. Blackmail.


Remember: dozen Republicans including Lindsey Graham went mysterious flight visit Vladimir Putin Independence Day 2018 possible days. came back Lindsey Graham notorious 180 Trump, going actively speaking constantly actively licking nuts.


Compromised. Yeah, probably want enrollment set hit point, want seemless transition 1a 1b means people ready go finish 1a. Sorry dumb question, market superspreader event than, say, wedding similar gathering? subreddit podcasts? competent administration would step in. Every western country way, handling better. reason states handling leadership vacuum. 75th percentile incredibly good given context. California South Dakota. dense cities. large Hispanic population. multi generational families living housing. industries like agriculture never really stopped. Also, large, people travel quite frequently. Including major airports intentional flights. Given factors, CA much worse outcome currently. 'imperial college vaccine' coming out... . strike kind person would mourned Hitler Also guess need go tell Joe Biden also wrong since stated vaccine distribution needs assistance speed up, speed up.

Guess logic failed. UK among deadly Europe, 981 deaths equivalent 4758 US deaths, UK joins Switzerland(4978 US equivalent yesterday)Poland(4916 US equivalent today)Austria(4698 equivalent yesterday)and Hungary(4699 US equivalent today)while US recorded 3,750 yesterday--Bulgaria recorded awful 7,361 US equivalent cases yesterday So.. story Dr. Li fucking funny. sick tired COVID. Moderna vaccine (more effective transportable one) funded Operation Warp cite facts instead pointless America-bashing. numbers coming from? see 3,398 yesterday? Imagine find vaccine hurt you, also protects crazy shit... like turns can't get lung cancer get vaccine.  Well agree. Education starts home support help parents. Distance learning didn’t change that. kid’s classes teachers send reminders attendance handing work. Parents control that. get families challenges parents let kids manage alone sink swim. IDK solution is. 

Our system tends allow kids fall behind pass high school without knowing much. sad truth. fix that, always disparities. ""Beliefs"" = established medical consensus attribute cause death infectious diseases...

But sure, I'm sure right. vertical drop cases reported lines holiday period. 233k December 23, 209k Christmas Eve, 152k Christmas 165k 26th.

That's strictly calender people work due holiday. No, last night.

My bigger point think I'm officially numb staggering numbers point wonder greater ones could shock me. Mickey Mantle Genes Definitly keep basement 😂😂 Well makes sense likely already immune. hygienist really make sense... virus ""been healthy"" want take vaccine, meanwhile relatively high risk group. risk management. states it. According CDC's models, vaccinating elderly first prevent 2-6.5% deaths vaccinated essential workers (Slide 21) Ok feels like really dumb question keep seeing 

1. know vaccines stop transmission
2. know didnt study that

My question is, study whether vaccines stop transmission? missing something seem super important? Ok. Time take break coronavirus news. Yeah, like pretend pro military, really killing them. 11M vaccines barely anything community spread.

Holding 2 weeks month get ultra high risk individuals far better doling whoever. live... sign administer. expect we'll still trying get people vaccinated mid-2022. kids grow ashamed him. willingly took life children suffer ignorance. Read article :| Activate national guards set shop every school gymnasium across country, add space convention center thats gotta huge step. morons failing upward life. Unbelievable. Roswell? It’s tens thousands extra dead people. OP, typically pass shot basically anything needles 30min. wake back 100% 5 min that. Department Defense supposed using Humvees rush things market arms? Conferences, PR stunts, positions created nothing. 

Here NJ we'll reaching immunity via herd rate. smart countries SUPPORT people small businesses time. avoid massive preventable catastrophe. country sick capitalist cancer. Pay corporations, watch people suffer die, spin lies disorganize us turn us reality, encourage us say “but businesses!” Fucking no. Dead people won’t contribute economy! Thank you. Probably ""how dying hoax?"" WFH stands “work home” Moderna stay refrigeration 12 hours. know fact doofus left 500 doses fridge overnight ruined them. Hard believe guy said sign m4a people chose democrats. people really damn stupid, example 70m trump voters. many perfectly young healthy people already died it

Very few. even hear girl deaths like freak occurrence. Yeah, entire 400 car parking lot local college used drive thru distribution. small 20 car lot city cut mass distribution. sincerely believe COVID mutate spike protein render vaccines ineffective get even close herd immunity we'll square one. 

This virus really spectacular natural _punishment_ lack **state capacity.** That's happens let party ""the GoVeRNMenT pRObLEM"" run government set discourse 50 years. trialed therefore one good data whether immunity continues 21 days give second dose.

I would guess - infact would surprised even improves - one run trial this. 

If we're going - run trials single dose ensure works - make go along. Yup. remember story 20.year old recovering dorm covid. Heart attack blood clot. Funny, read story asked aspirin given Covid patients. 3 days later read article UK investigating aspirin part covid treatments. also surprised one bit dexomethathone announced treatment option. steroids help reduce inflammation, particular one used often lung inflammation. used give cat..sadly passed away, still dexomethathone. God forbid catch covid vaccine ill talk doctor thinks take it. Although think I'd probably get prescription him. boat. Im night shift microbiology lab major hospital area. one night 3 covid pts pass time first blood cultures alerted second ones. Typically follow hours behind, night every hours seemed. made mistake reading notes one deaths. Truly horrid stuff. plenty electronic music time repetitious grooves, would generally find classical music arena (which Paul Lansky part of). classical electro-acoustic scene seems mostly revolved around [university music least end '90s, lot okay overcoming limitations could real-time hardware pre-recording electronically generated part live musicians play along/interact with. Blatant misinfo right there, general mortality rate .6%. People reinfected, shown extremely rare. areas mortality rate might closer 2% due factors, haven’t seen evidence even close 8% areas. governors knew last April May Trump dropped ball. 

They could done saying. They’ve known whole time here, many, including Governor talked summer fall National Guard distribute vaccine - he’s completely fucking quiet done nothing. way trying minimize risk household. Even groceries curbside pickup. true, 150 million ppl every year get flu vaccine flu season. definitely doable...   It’s better nothing usually Group get 1-2x salary without triggering medical eval. That’s anywhere near 10-12x income financial advisors recommend. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Part problem though great statistics long term issues younger people COVID. recently, we've seen athletes major issues, Florida basketball player, marathon runner, etc. data heart kidney organ issues tracked poorly, hard access one place *and* lack long term analysis simply novel disease. absolutely know COVID sometimes kill young healthy, statistically often older comorbidities. idea however, many young people develop long term lifetime complications may eventually disable kill them. Im Navy get seems every vaccine known man (way think are)

The reason give EVERY shot nations weaponize disease. 

You smallpox vaccine we're still worried weaponized.

There's actually interesting paper used hypothesize received many secondary vaccines (like smallpox) would impact success rate primary vaccines flu, etc. 

Turns false receive vaccines impact ability handle popular diseases.

However, antivaxers keep spreading myth completely falsified. know protects from.the new strain. Yeah hate every thread reddit overrun conservatives. That's crazy. Days sworn member possibly powerful legislative body planet. wonder going mind final moments. RIP. vaccine = get keep working home? Shit, really looking forward vaccine feel like would duty dogs decline it. think point let fucked administration shift blame governors.

I’m gonna wear two masks everywhere go now, that’s know I’m good person.  got vaccine Walmart ended walking around store texted allowed leave. 15 mins long Holy fuck.. heart working overtime? thought due anxiety? understand number, need vaccinate approximately 0.35 percent population per day.

In town 100k would need vaccinate 350 people per day. rate would take 285 days vaccinate entire town. doesn’t sound insurmountable. level measure taken fine  C.a. run Kimberly guilfoyles ex husband. Imagine insane married woman. Lol. strain ~70% contagious 1.0 version. cases = opportunities virus mutate. I'm growing increasingly worried upshot massive spike infections, given inept vaccine rollout thus far, virus might mutate point renders current generation vaccines useless reach herd immunity. That’s 1 5 Americans, Ive talked least 20 different people one say open get vaccine don’t know anyone wouldn’t get it. (and know likely going get downvoted this), I’m buying 73 million people bs getting good part good mean bad Well that's happening lol mean know US health care system bad. many posts outright rubbish. ""privileged get flu shot"" ass. Many lazy inform times covered.

And sub 30 dollars believe. videos, they're widely shown promoted. decent one Southern California.

I’m getting pretty annoyed 🙂 diagnosed covid beginning January 2020. depends individual, “cold-like” symptoms. friend mine got hospitalized.. recovered. [Here's 

I'm saying true. I'm saying look more. one shot reasonably good, covering people seems like serious option. simple countries done it. Pay them. 2k month, cover wages. world put plans place carried out. somehow politicians can't find dicks help, map someone placing hand spelling is, Ah yes, blame state. federal support states flying blind. It’s National problem one country. nothing value lost. Emotions powerful. allowed feel want. statistics cool deal emotions. looking anecdotal situation here. Numbers lie looked correct context. Lmao first thought really ""this ball games suck now"" wew You’re looking individual days looking seven day average, 2,250. US likely get 3k weeks it’s kinda insane think it’ll get 4k. Yep, recent season supposed take place starting around June 2020, think. touched BLM first couple episodes. idea, told basics family virus weakened heart undiagnosed problem. Certain media would ignore it, focusing TikTok dancing nurses, etc. Narrative always manipulated wherever go. Well, I'm sure someone told test it, exist. heck this??? think know titration means. feel heartless saying hope either a) companies ask without vaccine WFH permanently b) hospitals ability deny ventilators people choosing vaccinate unless good reason. don’t understand antivaxx bullshit. reddit angry little teenagers boohoo downvotes people calling China virus call UK virus right? Given people move around world nowadays, lockdown single country make sense primary care doctor got vaccine yesterday. said came hospital intercom made announcement vaccines available first come first serve 30 minutes only. dropped patient ran apparently.  US toxic people? Sure, averages long-enough timeline.

But there's 4 weeks (ish) worth vaccines sitting ice, waiting.

The problem think current distribution prevents supply issues: *if* there's manufacturing distribution difficulty come short 4 weeks, Bob can't get second dose?

On hand: 4 weeks long time pandemic, averaged damned. vaccine available pharmacy. state part healthcare workers providing covid19 patient care sign event code get administered mean duh. contagious. eveyone immune one less spread it.

As well, would like continue discussing experience Reddit, suggest checking /r/COVID19_support/ r/SuicideWatch

And general reference list mental health subs might helpful oppenly discuss feel; Even though it’s anymore deadly doesn’t mean many people die people it??? aren’t accounting massive amount cases weren’t counted, possibly double triple current cases. true mortality rate estimated around .6% cases. cruel prisoners US ridiculous. getting point almost crimes equal punishment. Lots moving cities smaller towns Also remote work may stay can. dont need vaccinate vulnerale atleast minimize mortality? vaccines already distributed. That’s bottleneck point. Sadly, think what’s coming going worse coming it. seeing biggest jump wealth disparities, growing poor, kids disappearing education system entirely, losing years growth due insufficient distance learning, exploding mental illness...The next decade going sad society still Thanksgiving aftermath?

God, going look like month.. terrifying. ""we're testing healthy ppl dont symptoms coronavirus even higher percentage tests we're coming back positive coronavirus"".... spongebob meme texas acting stupid goes viral every month I'm okay two shots now, next pandemic they're gonna need start combining confusing it? It’s pretty straightforward. want sit around table friends. everyone else. people get car like used to.

I'm saying bad person want. let's fool ourselves. want go back ""old normal"" like everyone else. Union health secretary also said 63% total COVID cases reported males 37% cases females

Damn, many men getting women?

That isn’t case elsewhere. Google term “failed state”.

There's nothing stopping journalists going camera getting waivers signed. forget subscribe hit bell icon latest peer reviewed studies.

For another news, China jailed journalist risked life report pandemic early Wuhan. Like know answering catching variant lethal another annoying. It’s best currently have, doesn’t make sense look individual days since it’s always much higher Tuesday-Friday. say prevent anything. think stick arguing things said. Obviously numbers ""even out"" look longer periods time, guess point need amount people vaccinated front possible. want total number people vaccinated + people infected recovered (within 90 days ever) high possible turn numbers around. Global Covid-19 cases = 81.9 million. Covid-19 deaths = 1.79 million. That's %2.19 death rate based raw data.

Where's data?

The highest observed death rate Mexico, %8.8. That's excluding Yemen %29 death rate, likely due low testing hesitant brand new vaccine technology *only* approved emergency use make someone ""antivaxx"", makes healthy skeptic Okay, tell life would past 9 months grocery stores never reopened. I’m religious person means, I’m exaggerating say feel blessed know five people gotten vaccine far (three nurses, medical assistant, cop). five people don’t worry like past year... didn’t realize physically carrying stress worrying felt vanish. Here’s hoping count many, many loved ones among number, quickly. progress maddeningly (and needlessly) slow. doomscroller sure, agree you. think we’ll getting Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine soon. J&amp;J results next month, hopefully able add that. Also, think Biden administration less blame states attitude, help feds starting January. saving lives worth it? nearly 8 Billion humans earth. That’s finance call “market saturation”. feel like none politician victims ever assigned Masque Red Death school. especially immune power. Biological facts care political feelings. feel like it’s people pre covid didn’t much going lives, want everyone suffer. vaccines

Nope comes free 9mm handgun. also talked CA. thread Texas. competition. conversation. done efficacy trials this. general vaccinations, delaying booster dose fine, leaves bit vulnerable interim. interval first second dose generally considered **minimum**, maximum. childhood vaccinations get delayed whatever reason, what's earliest get next dose order catch up. minimum interval often 4 weeks.

After get first dose, develop memory B cells helper cells hang around years, probably, even stop producing many antibodies. long cells still around get booster, re-activate multiply.

It needs show evidence either better tolerated effective approved treatments. can't submit new drug performs poorly. target, move.

It within FDAs purview, advisory committee, consider already approved treatments whether there's enough benefit introducing new treatment, compared risks.

And **I fully agree taking vaccine better taking vaccine**. 
There valid concern weighing risk getting disease side effect caused SARS-CoV-2 vs waiting bit longer reduced risk contracting COVID-19 expense fight real deal.

Also people immunocompromised probably get chance apply ""better"" vaccine picked default makes sense immunocomprised people preferential treatment.

You know would cause really bad press, damage reputation vaccinations cause distrust science? people heavily encouraged take lesser vaccine even though made disease history known doctor end short long term damage Covid-19 due ""lesser"" vaccine causing complications.

Thanks state organization individuals could arrest individuals planning break law put somewhere incapable breaking law. She’s hot. virus gone far!  Seems kinda ridiculous. herd immunity virus goes mutations, like common cold also coronavirus? there's cure common cold. cured Covid different? influenza? People line get flu shots ""popular strains"" every year. changes cure either. imagine virus weaken eventually, viruses done. current death rate Covid alone, hundreds thousands last Christmas. poster correct. days minimum amount time wait doses. Ideally second dose would given soon possible minimum amount time passed, given later ""useless"" series need restarted. Agree. beginning pandemic lot wrangling whether people “needed” $1200 whether deserve others. Economists saying sure better giving everyone today rather spending time deciding deserves perfect precision. first don’t even scientific evidence whether vaccine stops transmission know stops getting hospitalized meaning elderly weak get first. people get healthcare staff nursing home staff possibly teachers (so kids go class.) that’s it. go age.

It’s gonna save lives. don’t take chances trying slow virus might able sure get vulnerable vaccinated spring crush death rate, open hospital beds, basically normality back. it’s also finally snowing cold lot places. can’t outdoor dining anymore sports kids indoors now. could Eh, I’m staying locked 20s get vaccine. live cold state, probably won’t even want go things till April. I’m hoping weather starts breaching 60s, we’ll vaccines available general population. get mine, hunker 10 days go mask without much worry. second dose, hang around people who’ve vaccinated worries all. 

At point, I’ve locked nine months. things start ease month get vaccine, I’m going ease well. Might well wait weeks get myself. that’s me, people don’t care getting that’s prerogative. parents get it, stress levels go way way way down. friend who's nurse awfully depressed lately. said quality care provides drastically reduced due supply issues. said, believe we're precipice colossal mental health crisis healthcare industry.  know 1 person.

But consider this:

The average person dying obesity dies younger age person dying Covid-19. Covid 1 percent fatality rate USA. Compare roughly half Americans obese.

Statistically, obesity bigger threat lifespan Covid. Granted kills indirect ways. course Covid scarier feels control, less understood unfamiliar. 

But imagine counter every death disease linked obesity. wonder would lifestyle? deserves whatever consequences gets. people need realize people's lives health important splash mountain course Cal Cal full fuckin morons  Tell that's untrue Bill Gates needs live people mind control nanochip them, dead bodies.

the difference subtle, i’m kinda sick people saying certainty concrete data. multiple spike protein mutations new variants. always religious people thinking they're special anyone else? never said outcomes dependent party running it. twisted that. absolutely impacts whether largely lefty media reports stories. 

I dig data many states including current rates. absolutely true correlation spread certain executive orders. Research shown this, ignored. Research shows spread restaurants, ignored. Research shows schools open perhaps greater harm coming generation students closed, ignored. I’m sick tired obvious bias site media handled. It’ll take 10 years rate! 95% figure coming from?

British variant months Trump little nothing it. probably closer 3 million. Reporting delays christmas holiday Mary Ann! Fuck covid! 

Rest peace, 2020 fucking nightmare  seems like dumb idea test everyone COVID, even asymptomatic, though.

Wouldn't answered question? weighing likelihood catching virus getting sick getting people sick likelihood vacicne causing problems.

We know millions cases disease really brutal, even people young otherwise healthy. always, super rare.

We know tens thousands vaccine tests vaccine safe medium term. seen adverse events reported short term since started rolling out. enough info detect 1 10 million events, enough zero significant adverse trials reported could attributed vaccine.

So impossible something might happen. lot less likely catching COVID, especially paramedic can't isolate might exposed fairly high viral load.

- Pfizer/BNT trials observed symptomatic preservation cases observed. 
- Pfizer 'were observed' trials tested Covid therefore could asymtomatic.

This information test transmission Covid vaccine recipient predominantly testing safety efficacy vaccine. We'll likely see transmission studies people get vaccinated information flowing in. Expected Jan:

“Slaoui said Phase 3 trial recruitment vaccine completed.

“We feel confident readout efficacy take place month January, likely EUA submission take place month January,” said Slaoui, adding hopes approval submission reached first half February.” would ideal, would OK not. Give Modern Pfizer shots vulnerable everyone else get AZ/J&amp;J. 

Personally, I'm pretty confident J&amp;J due Phase I/II results. 98% percent 1,000 participants developed neutralizing antibodies. think also assume it’s similar flu terms many actually die it. actual number flu deaths percentage get it, total population, whereas covid higher chance infecting everyone. Vaccines help lot flu, think many people say flu bad cold, actually influenza. link rn K1 1300 enrolled interim analysis planned triggered 40 total infections. 20 something now.  study says percentage includes resultant use products customers companies. Meaning including consumers use cars, platics, etc. 

I agree need drastically alter companies run, providing services products using, restrictions operations emissions company would nullify importance reducing automobile pollution, example.

In short, yes corporations much bad, everyday people still going experience pretty drastic changes lifestyles mitigate global warming ecological collapse. believe people seeing lower number would motivated push number higher? me, exactly opposite. saw headline said ""250K NYers already vaccinated,"" would far motivating. Seeing low number means low TRUST. probably what's needed save nation economy point. beginning pandemic, people saying we’d lucky vaccine 18 months. two New Year, people whining isn’t magically systemically injected every American. dont plagued. rotting bodies enough. Pretty freaking brutal. can't even tell ya many public scenes tv/movie laughing touching look like disgusting germ orgies now. crazy shit, going back that. Yes county depending state. accomplish this, US would’ve needed vaccinate roughly 1.18 million people per day December 14th New Year’s Eve.

This country still struggles provide sufficient, accessible testing, yet people seriously thought we’d able vaccinate 20 million people three weeks? much even federal problem? understanding vaccines mailed states, states aren’t using fast enough elected officials die Covid include several state legislators: Republican state senator Minnesota, New Hampshire’s new Republican speaker House Representatives, North Dakota, David Dean Andahl, Republican known “Dakota Dave,” elected posthumously state House Representatives dying virus. seems pattern here, can't make out. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

If using PCR tests, lot places are, necessarily tell currently infected contagious.

Let fix you. People mixed feelings vaccine. There.... fixed fear pain. know people want get vaccine, even get early, want get first “bleeding edge” inoculation wave. suspect demand greatly increase first second batch people get second shots...

80% pretty great.

That means 80% reduced risk catching covid. Think powerline guy nuclear. Subs, carriers. Keep powersupply going. fear pain. came Covid days getting vax

But seriously, sure tests done, (in general, variant), especially age group. know goes narrative, we're actually quite well. idea vaccinations ramp silly. sticky situation, phased approach wasting time sitting vaccines going people's arms. pandemic pushing country absolute limit need using 100% available supply every day, extending pandemic therefore excess death hospitalizations.

Good thing competent president / administration entering office 3 long weeks away. Colorado said would summer general public 3 weeks ago commented since then. There's specifics summer either. I'm hopeful could earlier that, there's way know. stressful. It’s conservative area, though masks required Costco, lot people refuse wear elsewhere. weaponize covid? said that. deaths plural said. I’ll another full year saves lives anything? Grocery stores definitely essential, paid enough. retail workers tricked thinking heros working pandemic minimum wage. flu around 60-70% effective rate. Covid vaccines 90%+. Plus flu bunch different viruses part vaccine guess ones dominate year. we’re targeting spike protein specifically hopefully see better results since it’s pretty stable part(key lock cells). things way faster! New variant probably everything pandemic must go phase denial positivity bitter truth shared. 

Here examples denial already forgot went through: 

Masks needed

Does survive surfaces

Not airborne 

Once recover cannot get again

Long term effects rare hurt people already compromised immune systems

Targets lungs, maybe heart evidence effect brain 

We keep again. Play everything down, win major points talking positive even though positivity completely crushed within weeks. 

You seeing virus spread lot faster now, know UK mutation something else, spreading faster within groups, can't blame thanksgiving trends started well even though peoples idiotic behavior helping. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes did. I'm quoting numbers publicly available. extrapolating data conjecture. Cases underestimated, deaths. 

Do know sure far numbers are? would you? Please explain.   already year know another full year. Stop already vaccine talk. also kill everybody infects maybe lock older people? Like don’t even want see non weaponized warts  YESSSSS! Let's gooooo! Maybe everyone got corona virus cold, immunity. Basically thing SF shelter Brilliant news. accelerate things considerably. Can't wait see vaccination rate rise rise. wife's entire side family voted Trump ten talked said willing get vaccine. Clearly, god plan him.... die.  understand it, you’re describing tests carried people gather groups holidays rush get test, driving cases deaths numbers really pandemic flatlining tapering off.

While may true testing conducted, positivity rate going too. means every 1000 tests they’re number positive results higher before. cases found, cases per 1000 tests. key indicator real thanksgiving surge. less people actually virus before, positivity rate would going increased testing. Hello Goose Creek! get command, make sure start working BS Nuc Eng Tech soon get surface/dolphin. would advise reenlisting. got 6 civilian world pays premium ex-nukes. prob use degree matter, BS what's important. I've got friends went electrical, gas, oil, Amazon, medical technology, nuke plants, chemistry R&amp;D, works. Follow RosStat excess death numbers, bypasses self-reporting regional governments. bureau goes national death registries. data published end every month.

The government bureau tasked ""official"" coronavirus data collection RosPotrebNadzor (consumer rights), compiles data submitted regional governments.

The difference two bureaus' figures 150k (229k vs 72k). Russian government publishing statistics (RosStat national statistical service publishes monthly), difference reflects difference inputs (national vs regional chart confirmed case/death count.

Second chart RosStat excess death chart.

Both sorted region charted vs historical values. Knock out. Easter! 
I positive EU 700 million people signaled AZ would willing cooperate work data mess would asked approval apply SARS-COV-2 fatality rate low especially people 40, lethality rate similar lower influenza asymptomatic pre-symptomatic spread. result, there's evolutionary pressure evolve less lethal form. happened years ago new forest U.K. 22 years ago. 6000 mink released A.L.F (animal liberation front) decimated local wild life, mean bird colonies wiped out. remember it, issue mink cold weather animals don’t great deal prey naturally super aggressive kill prey come across food scarce. mild environment like U.K. mink went ham killed thought eat instinct. Took years cull back. mRNA vaccines absolute winners here. 

I thought got developed quickly becauase researching similar vaccine almost 20 years Crazy, Brexit related? Can’t believe EU far behind UK vaccines. I’m also still waiting viable solutions wanted mention. Super cool never wanted answer that, reason you’re concerned whether arguing bad faith (what?) God forbid extremely valuable, moral competent leaders succumb deadly virus. would good thing all. high school used go in-person classes, mostly students special needs one following restrictions anymore. hard ""feel"" effects virus low population density compared city like New York. asked info dunce. original comment say shit. mean super contagious variant already us It’s issue degree-

The Catholic Church runs 25% hospitals earth- organization comes close. Plop plop fizz fizz, that's sell twice much.

Can't tell studied. Well is, really. different factions state, still Army control Federal government. I’m every lying
That’s gonna happen claim incorrect. goa distribute 20M doses end 2020 yesterday 11.4M. Looks like won’t hit 20M they’re certainly factor 10x. 

They’ve injected 2.1M doses. THAT’S bottleneck. They’ve got 9M distributed doses sitting freezers getting injected people’s arms. Distribution isn’t primary problem right now. assume they’re referring first approve vaccine Western world, one highest, highest, vaccine rates large countries world, developing approving vaccine widely considered best hope develop countries. Shows much paying attention.

They approved 2 full doses well tested higher age groups. Honestly loved Army reason, take vaccine get. Anthrax? Nah. Yellow fever? today. Smallpox? cares eradicated hit anyway. anyone want immunity everything beyond me. Shame vaccine bullets yet. thing antigen tests good regular survey testing, extremely effective format.

There's sense whatsoever using symptomatic testing, much sensitive options like PCR LAMP.

The circumstances treat even PCR negative ""True Negative"" limited, since PCR test administration &amp; processing high false negative rate. DD mean? Probably last person use meaningful anything Joe Rogan. interesting people there, it’s kicking people’s faces, don’t care say Natural sunlight? take you’ve never visited fall winter. expected respond wasn’t talking thing talking about?

Like I’m sure expect here, bud. want change views? criticized respond someone yet won’t acknowledge responding to. American freedumbs. think 1 million per week acceptable? 

Because don’t. incredible in-depth analysis. I’ve never heard that. happen? That's still almost year vaccinate everyone. almost like publicly funding stuff higher degree. ok, he's god now. non, confused.

I specifically asked publicly available medicines vacinnes. 

you posted links phase 1 trials. description handle shows can't give vaccine anyone. Patients like awake IMO. Buh Chyna! Muh freedumbs! Happy Cake Day 😊 weren’t EU pushing so? really dropped ball badly? flagged one of, best hope months. take reduced holiday hours means person usually fudges numbers forgot it, someone let cat bag realized happened. 

That's Florida government nutshell, someone still physically go work around people reverence social distancing mask-wearing, fear real rate infection much greater even 22.75%...

It's also fine fridge 5 days, even need full 30 minutes defrost.

We technical issues, leadership issues. personal (nurse doctors) man ""free"" ICU beds. know holiday season. Yeah im 4 :) impression doctors CPR nearly always useless COVID anyway, traditional formality deployed great risk that's regulations say, helps. Mostly virus shown us things different.

And, importantly, things needed change first place. Good point. Essential workers bit true too.

Uhhh...what??? They’re 100% effective, that’s there’s preventative measures besides masks. mask protects people you. US trial still running deliver data early February. EMA still waiting data AZ. knows case. What’s academic UK distributing vaccine primarily demographic completely untested demographic dosing level. bioethical issues innumerable UK made leap hope educated assumptions safety efficacy demographic prove true wishful thinking. 

If inject population half tested vaccine turns regimen isn’t efficacious irreparable harm trust vaccines UK around globe. mention unlikely possible safety issues arise. Covid vaccine made tired shit 8 hours. First time I've ever noticeable reaction vaccine.

Still worked though, bearable Maybe maybe want someone skilled reconstitute it, dumping crushed dry ice every 5 days tote, opening twice day.

Once mixed 5 hours, anyone draw .3ml could use dogs insulin syringes, 100 units get .3ml

You literally admitted arguing strawman explicit terms. Thanks calling smart clever though. thought process people 65+ make ~~strikethrough deaths hospitalizations~~ voter base. 

FTFY. Approved emergency use fully licensed. Uhm... Considering spreads, cant vaccinate one group people deefinitively preexisting condition, terminally stupid, since likely refuse vaccinate Yep, pretty similar lived Spain back april. ER thou, internal medicine ward, mind you, freaking surgeon treating pneumonia patients. 

Just small difference thou, remember covid deniers patients getting bankrup. Well sign up! Even 90% efficacy rate still means 1 10 people still get infected getting vaccinated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m guessing calculated number doses needed vaccinate everyone US (331,000,000 x 2 = 662,000,000 doses). get weekly vaccination 10 years get 665m doses: 665,000,000 / 10 = 66,500,000 get weekly doses 66,500,000/52 = 1,279,000 doses per week, kinda around current rate doses moment. 

The statement correct CURRENT RATE yes, would take 10 years. However, current rate isn’t good indication future vaccinations. It’s slower expected bound teething issues beginning rate get better time. Add vaccines becoming available. Also, current records may accurate it’s holiday season would accurate look numbers weeks time. yep exactly Covid vaccine result worldwide effort. 

The US can’t take credit. Maybe, sounds like splitting hairs me. whole ""kids immune"" thing seemed like lie day one, passing time addition new information. yeah we're agreement lol explaining rhetoric original comment LA surge people stopped social distancing etc. Pretending new strain really lets hook makes seem like nothing could mitigate spread. even headline? Stop publishing sensationalist shit. stop putting subreddit. hundreds ""person tests positive twice"". 

Millions infected vaccinated. Tests perfect, immune systems perfect, vaccines perfect. \*hundreds thousands\* who: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- get covid twice immune system protect them

\- get covid despite vaccinated due vaccines working 9X% time.

\- test positive twice despite once, due viral remnants bad test

\- test positive twice despite actually never disease, due two false positives

\- die day vaccine reason connected vaccine, people die every day

\- die day vaccine \*because vaccine\* vaccinate billion, 1-in-a-billion side effects really strange severe, accept too.

&amp;#x200B;

None unexpected, strange worrying. \*sounds\* unexpected newspapers try make headlines it. Stop that. Interesting. stated/implied fast-tracking Oxford/AZ vaccine, concerns MHRA stuck guts approved *now* (even earlier previous 'approval next week' reports).

Personally I'm still skeptical (imo US EU fast-tracking this, must good reasons why). let's hope shot fine, (still ongoing) US trial US FDA waiting good result.  That’s fair. That’s true guess media politicians put pressure approve quickly considering UK earlier expected committed ultimate cardinal sin; incorrect math. biontech mrna  Dial Peppa Pig programme telly! Yupp need fundamentally change relate animals, environment people. pandemic showed don’t care either Hopefully EU approve January considering Great Britain *That world going ‘rona*. Okay that's thought. friends LA San Diego tell mask compliance high. confirm high Bay Area well. sure idea California lockdown joke coming from, especially since outdoor dining closed month. sure live people I’ve talked Georgia no’s still undecided Desperately? Desperately what? I’m depressed too? making joke labeled sarcastic America handled Covid suddenly wiped everything I’ve done country? almost forgot it’s like talking brick wall thinks someone liking Trump means want country fail. courtesy I’ll answer following afterwards go separate ways fuck off. assume better things engage discussion won’t go anywhere. would rather talk germany US

I brought Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine first vaccine approved ***United States***. Yes know Moderna vaccine entirely U.S. based (this fact vaccine bring outside Reddit), second approval America. said U.S. first vaccine approval, Pfizer vaccine, result that’s one referring to. would bring second vaccine American public we’re talking one hit approval first?

Why care countries using vaccines it’s America America America you? already said don’t care made vaccine long it’s safe effective. global pandemic, olympics. reddit hive mind bothers much, go Parler something. Either way, don’t care. selfish person. grass always greener side. thing back mind lack longer term study side effects new type vaccine technology. Everything I've read heard touts less likely cause side effects great, usually find things expect happen. least one leading 'frontline', extremely reputable experienced clinician expressed similar views tend agree with. 

That said, anyone refuses wider study proves safe goddamn moron. Go fuck covid island somewhere practice natural selection... easily, meaning infection lighter viral load.

I feel dumb asking, tell means? mean takes less virus damage? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Pfizer vaccine now? Pathetic would rather put shit expose everyday. Measles Hep B there's percent difference, US numbers estimated - that's use those.

There percent difference France US example use though. US estimate one also.

Come on. infected what? Rage. ... I'd teensie't piece. simple. Like boarding airplane. First 80+, 75+, 70+, etc.

It likely take summer vaccinate enough people stop contagion. Whereas could vaccinate 90% people die covid end February pursuing age based approach. means strategy stop contagion would result perhaps 4 addition months deaths near current level. reading article 9 months real fear something comes like 2009 H1N1 pandemic, second third wave, mutates something death rate rivaling ebola effects long-lasting like HIV. friend lost 3 relatives within week other, COVID. 2 60 one morbidly obese. delightful. already community spreading (this dude travelled according article), probably while, since we've lax monitoring new strains.

In Britain, initial reviews thing, estimating [they going speed vaccination rate ten keep outbreaks slow enough avoid crushing health care system. Looks like we're going also going pick pace. Covet-$19 T-shirt don’t gauge life downvotes. Interesting haven’t anyone made unemployed yet. would interesting see perspective changed manage mass redundancy event colleagues management. Oh.

I argue 80% efficacy 2 weeks schedule better impact fight pandemic rather 95% 2 month schedule..
 
though depends efficacy first shot, seemed test that.. correct I'm wrong though.. think read chart wrong. measles hepB France 90% 91% kids. USA 92% 91% USAs figures estimates only. 

Im sure say 91% less 91%. earth gonna get people return second dose 3 months? anyone else virus remained congested since then? maybe 10+ weeks im still constantly clearing nose unable breathe well. love Put perspective. Top 5 European countries worst affected excluding UK Russia, Spain, France, Italy Germany. Combine todays cases countries, left 77,544 cases. UK 53,135 ALONE, leaves 24,419 less - country small compared rest put together, too. absolute shambles, Boris Johnson cronies ashamed themselves. learned god damn thing since first wave, despite new variant going around even contagious. firmly believe approach since day one UK take chin like said first delay lockdown changed. European countries seeing back second wave, us. know good place get KN-95 masks? tell they're good? I've seen boxes corner store really know look ensure they're legit. really matter cases reported days late? really changes whether number cases 5,000 10,000? ones elevated critical oxygen levels. opposed ones bottom shelf, whose critical oxygen levels elevated all. ones third (top) shelf elevated critical oxygen levels.  I’m running reasons stay hopeful. seems like won’t back “normal” till 2022. don’t know stay inside another year. ‘Likely’ ‘around bit’, idk, ‘a guess’. wish better program keep track hasn’t vaccine though would let things progress faster, think.

aren't giving vaccination cards? anyway feel like problem getting people take it, people somehow getting 2 doses tell to? Nope, countries hit pretty hard well people think it’s safe? promise aren’t, here. Downtown bars packed shoulder shoulder every weekend, dine restaurants impossible get reservations at, almost nobody know working home anymore everyone’s boss made come back maskless offices. nice also frustrating. would rather lower actual number way around, still want know many people got vaccinated, many people managed accurately follow information chain. Turn news always victim. Stop naive. Anyone get flu shot. CVS offers free insurance get coupon, too. I'm 30s underlying health issues get flu shot every year. Source? fucking wet markets.  Welp. Hold onto butts. go. transmissible virulence. That's going end well given half US can't understand wear mask vaccine roll moving speed comatose sloth. fan Newsom beginning quick response. pandemic prolonged poor leadership showed.

1. name 1 publicly available medicine vaccine used new technology

2. possible know long term side effects? medicines waited 10 years allows time see long term effects. Corrected it, thanks! point still stands though, mortality rate? looking information got power microsoft edge! modern GOP. resignation plan?

In case, hope taking steps catch first place. 1% caught died. Seems likely one would survive consequences. study two links deep CNN link highlights real issues- timing since exposure quality sample. Yes, 100% samples taken day picked PCR day infection occurs- limitation test, necessarily deficiency it. everyone different infective dose, everyone different viral loads day 3,4,etc, pop earlier others positive.

Every virus incubation period, every virus period contagious undetectable even sensitive molecular methods. get needlestick injury known-HIV source, may know contracted virus year, even though infectious couple hours depending mode infection.

All stories people literally going advice meet family feel sick. bigger failure folks. Lab testing often hard time keeping hubris, covid different.  Yeah that’s statistic. 25% “others”, still know come in-home proximity. 95% boost already 99% chance, instead 1 person group 100 dying closer 1 2000. Also, likely prevents infection 95% asymptomatic carriers longer keeping infection rates high (more studies needed one). Far, far contagious. cases = hospitalizations = hospitals full = people getting care need outside Covid = continues build Covid long-tail, won’t even understand magnitude next year two. bloodiest regardless measure it. fair pretty egregious lie. agree advice still followed inexcusable set stage widespread mistrust public health officials crucial time.  know could get N95 masks? Mink naturally escape mink farm, can't avoided. Many likely escaped infection detected.

The Pacific Northwest home many different types weasels. I'm wondering weasels catch Covid, mountain lions, lynx, bobcats might get infected.

The cosmetic industry uses mink products. False eyelashes example often mink, mink oil used leather hair products among uses.

People live frozen Yukon consider wastefulness disrespectful thoughtless, use everything hunt need fur hides survive. People work live extreme cold conditions need fur insulation, parkas I've seen goose usually. fashion cosmetic industry supporting majority mink use.  No. We’ve known couple weeks. Plus vaccine trials weren’t sequencing genomes people got infected we’ve barely started vaccinating general public. I'm sorry budge like probably ruin joke. Although still think funny, thought wanted share. joking something like lead people actually believing things? like group people started joking earth flat meme spread much around world another group people actually believed real started think conspiracy theories it? least thought played out. Also anti vax people understand deny science believe joke believe, joke shared internet. said, think joking things probably slows progress problem ours. two sense, please @ thanks logical spreads fast family close friends less reserved.

But also know infected you.
At work, shopping dinner restaurant likely know it.

So statistics say infections happen home private lot others listed unknown.

But someone bring infection family circle infect somewhere else. believe likely:

We underreported 18 million.

Or

We disfunctional federal government, ineptly told pfizer send inventory, referenced claim?

I know state's governor took twitter receiveall vaccines promised, planned deploy. 

20 million promised vaccinated end year dude. 18 million unreported. There’s indication strain less deadly. contagious.

Ideally things would gone smoothly. bound challenges. assume work kinks get things moving slowly. vaccines help. curiosity, live got vaccine first person UK did? got second shot today. gained 1kg yesterday. means I'll weigh 1 ton 3 years. pandemic started one infected person.

Let know feel like virtual company!  I'm sorry subreddit dedicated news global pandemic bright cheery. work Pfizer know exact reason, government wanted companies produced vaccines like 3-4 times speed normally would, given circumstances pandemic, would think company would want blanket protection advance. It’s deal companies figured government companies asking nothing. Moderna also got procreations. fund first place created congress. protection cover willful misconduct rushed product, cover unintended consequences.

Plus companies still don’t blanket protection law protecting EU Pfizer actually based still get trouble mishandling it. six days. cumulative total Dec. 23rd. hope vaccinations also exponential.

Edit: I’ll check Brave though, thanks tip 👍 public relations, one first things learn talking public project timelines quite simple: 

Underpromise overdeliver.

Oxford/AZ exact opposite. idea thinking back Spring/Summer sent news releases best case scenario predictions vaccine “available” September October. Even worse, releases never explained available meant provided little details steps necessary actually get vaccine public. 

People ready give Nobel Prize, based promises news release presumably Oxford. 

At time, sub gushing Oxford/AZ Pfizer Moderna barely mentioned. Six months later Pfizer Moderna heroes, story tortoise hare vaccines become case study PR next decades. That’s false. There’s ton articles confirm antibodies exist least 6 months along memory cells. reason decrease predictions 100 20 million mainly due Pfizer production issues. never lofty goall 20 million people 

[Pfizer says facing production issues COVID-19 trumpist lying. “Damn, wish international crime wear mask”  Why? hope stay healthy. say upsets you? Genuinely confused. think people rebound pretty quick numbers go down. 

This hell hypochondriacs. dad's one, moderate one that, know March June called 911 three times thinking dying COVID heart attack something, never anything serious anxiety attack. I'm sure many times he's called since then.  let 98% people suffer 2%? thinking that. countries bans Americans now. 

The countries banned international travelers entry way back Feb/March ones seem best.  ""...and key decisions left state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell""

I highly doubt he's solely responsible decisions made. grass literally means catching Rona, yea, definitely greener. put shit home, exposing myself. mean everyone know age covid either symptoms, fever day, lost smell like week. know 10-15 people who’ve Nice. called Dy Together.

Like Fighting Artichokes. like 6 million need vaccinated anyway. NYC got 100k day current pace Israel, country population around 8 million too, could done two months. Anecdotally personally know several healthcare workers, staff nursing homes paramedics already gotten first dose scheduled week. seems like phase 1a well way complete.  mean, 6 months ago experts said chance would even get vaccine year. 

Which experts? really surprised worst poster /r/stlouis making shit again. uh no... behold, iNeedle! :p reason decrease predictions 100 20 million mainly due Pfizer production issues. never lofty goall 20 million people complaining. 

Even Biden apparently aiming 1 million day takes office, smartly setting low expectations. Thank you. Interesting people talking something else happening week?

/rant Doesn’t vaccine cover this? That's called UK, Australia, NZ, Canada, etc. No, want live forever. authoritarianism allow that. That’ll probably get upvoted roof, shouldn’t. shouldn’t wish death anyone. 2% lot still lot. reschedule surgery already IMPORTANT NOTE: least two variants take note of: UK variant that's listed above, [and second variant South Africa, contagious prone severe illness younger independently mutated, related. moron. say covid around forever mean like flu example always every year. 2 diseases eradicated till today eradication covid probably going happen. vaccines end pandemic side things covid longer huge risk concern unlikely immunity granted first dose (between 52% 85% effective based limited data Pfizer/Moderna) disappears suddenly 30 days. 100% incorrect. that. know 20 healthcare workers vaccinated none actually work COVID positive patients many cases simply undiagnosed pre-existing conditions otherwise would manifested much later life. Yes, priority basis *most likely transmit* disease, might makes sense. data ground-truth collected, models built. 

Consider 20-year-old meal delivery elderly people, meals-on-wheels, minutes visiting/listening delivery.  One delivery person could infect lot clients, course days.

I see could get good ground-truth, even attribute-sets, build models quickly.  interesting question. barriers data-quality data-access, make unlikely helpful several years, best.

I suspect decision model would jump data easily, if/when data collected. cannot stop distributing vaccine spend years figuring first-in-line. 

In mean time, ""shots-in-arms"" seems like good short-term goal. Next month so, us. 

It’s looking bit uncertain it’ll approved EU part group 39 people tested positive. isolated 2 weeks. talked isolation. 32 us symptoms. 4 loss smelling taste, 3 coughing lethargic feelings couple days. Zero hospitalized. Granted, none us pre-existing conditions us age 50.

I think experiences like makes people feel like blown proportion. pre-existing conditions, treat like deadly plague stay far away possibly can. pre-existing condition, leave house risk take appropriate safety precautions, treat infected stay away people may pre-existing conditions. wondering: Harris gets it, people stop complaining Republicans jumping line? feel like loosen vaccine criteria many sitting there.

start selling highest bidder rest us pay less turn. government work states get distribution plans place.

States ones distribution. They're far better federal government it. There's nothing help with. understand healthcare structured country. boot oppression taste like safety? 50 years Covid like cold flu grandkids they'll look back history think fucking mad. know many did, I'm hospital worker. wife dentist, tier 1A, small local practice, despite people's faces day, get hygeinists. eventually called 15 pharmacies yesterday reported gotten distributions got wait listed two, got call afternoon thank goodness. It'll lot fun kids! 

They pox parties play pin tail iron lung! Yh variant transmissible nothing suggest point current covid vaccines effective anymore. assuming stays case need adjist flu vaccine every year get people take every year assuming immunity lasts longer year. sat around house half week broken foot didn’t go emergency room, call that? Also, fair, specifically said cloth face coverings. yes, jury still wasn’t cloth coverings would effective. like everyone history science, data became clear adjusted guidelines.  Getting mad online woman Facebook saying won’t able leave country till 2023. Yeah sick. forever though right classrooms? regular COVID, antibodies protect new variant? op talking aliens? Also happens get second shot 3 6 months later. need 3rd shot? long dormant mutant abilities awaken? government work states get distribution plans place. It’s clear day haven’t bothered. don’t sit around waiting states provide answers, work already done.

Please keep humping leg incredibly incompetent administration. Want heap praise handled PPE well? millions unadministered vaccines? CA 48th hospitals population ratio almost 40m people. LA county alone 10m people. easy things get control stats. also - possibly not. 

We're basically started. know 3  know 10. lot smart friends. Butbthe annual flu vaccines usually 40-60% effective. Pfizer/moderna 90%+ effective. mention alot people actually get flu vaccine. IIRC according CDc around 49% Americans take annual flu vaccine. Wow, 41 too. I’m asking people thoughts topic prayers say... wow Herd immunity higher requirement contagious disease, comment nonsensical single person.  become actual fever? Living armpit USA blessing moments, cost living first stimulus covered several months expenses. We've lost half employment here. concerning sure, somehow keeps working out. hate break you, almost certainly wild mink picture. Same. probably know 20 people people frontline working COVID patients Cut crap.  millions vaccines administered. Well they’ve 100% credible COVID far trust Yeah people taking account logistics get better, production increase, rate vaccinations increase next 3 4 months. amount vaccinations seen past week better month. Tons experts saying take months regular healthy individuals working healthcare would get it.

Take deep breath everyone. turn coming. start vaccination clinic. going away.

It never was, idea many sensible people could become convinced otherwise. 100% behind flattening curve, April seemed like goalposts moved *extinguishing* curve. Utter madness.  Locked widespread rule breaking 10 minutes in.   approach COVID changed politician fucks up, might need reexamine yourself. technically successfully suppressing virus NZ done? still slight covid scare back August put Auckland short lockdown again. can't bad numbers test anyone Genuinely curious, mention getting vaccine makes non danger others covid. Previously news read vaccine make immune covid, lesser reaction get maybe even asymptomatic get still carrier. Please correct things changed? really good hear. bad reaction flu shot couple years ago ended ER steroids two weeks. doctors told never get flu shot I’ve debating get vaccine. especially true young children aren’t approved vaccine. catch visible symptoms others died, clue long term consequences kids face even didn’t seem greatly affected. really hope people compassion wear mask public everyone safely vaccinated. taking since summer 2019  malls open? I've searching anything says AstraZeneca vaccine approved use USA. know that? Rough timeline?   thats record wanna broken Sadly lots posters want that. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Please say word kill. know 2! Agree 100%. intend wear masks ever post pandemic, except next time wildfires California :( know got pics! That's messed 41 .. sadly young. word underlying conditions. case ""they"" referring state's department health covid pharmacy partnership. I've communicating since October try get vaccine access extremely high risk population outside skilled nursing facility. 

The department health sends pharmacy partnership pharmacy partnership sends DOH. ""They"" can't tell us clinics dates be. can't tell us might know clinics be. can't tell us many people ahead us. one answers. one tell us answers might come. sad didn’t need read article know (R) associated person? easier go place work place people live vaccinate everyone. I'm sure logistics work say ""people conditions list get vaccinated"". requires somehow identifying verifying vaccinating right people. 600 tests small sample size.

It's probably natural sunlight creating: Vitamin D. body's sufficient breaks cascade virus body?

I heard also treatment 1918 Pandemic, sunshine. matters vaccine prevents Agreed. Pharmacist well. know corporates idea right now. Questions answers based data [source (thanks Dr. John Campbell crunching data us):

1. increased risk reinfection new variant? No

2. existing vaccines less effective? No

3. new variant cause severe illness? No

4. new variant increase chance hospitalized? No

5. new variant cause deaths? No

6. increase rate transmission? Yes, increased 50-55 percent

7. become predominant variant UK? Yes

8. become predominant variant globally? Maybe (I would say probably) Although flu main reason annual flu vaccine slight changes flu? far there's nothing suggest existing covid vaccines affected new covid variants found South Africa UK. assuming immunity lasts longer year may necessarily need get covid vaccine yearly  New York City city. Hi! anyone know accurate websites/ trackers vaccines US? really want keep top watching it, can't find anything :( understand can't send links, would love know good source What's current plan getting people 2nd dose? 


What people get confused get moderna something pfizer shot? Well...*now, ^you lost significant amount credibility* mean gets worse think kind martial lock down? Old people run country they're risk imagine they're petrified strain going nuts South Eastern England already seeded countries.

With increased infectivity imagine want smother much possible. chances vaccine causes overreaction immune system encounters real thing causes much harm would without? That’s mostly would worry limited knowledge it. Huh? asked question matter finding it. I'd put money what's behind CA's surge. CO sequences 1/400 cases. one hit we'd expect around 400 cases (give take lot). obviously community spread here, also certainty variant causing surges Denver (Sep-Nov) LA (December). example thread: 23 genetic sequences done December LA; 0/23 new variant. puts pretty tight upper bounds common be. catch it? people listening already slow spread. people get 10 months, ever. can’t believe clear mathematical fallacy top comment. Free heroin cure COVID?  Pretty sure tests also less reliable back then, Dr Li Wenliang reportedly swabbed eight times tested positive. 

We still high levels false negatives rates, bad symptomatic phase. vaccine help people already sick? Cool cool cool. I'm forced shutdown business involves working building rent...but fuck it. Go vacation. Let's keep working. *rage* guess Google translated article. really think voters remember little Abbott Patrick protect state pandemic they'll send wheeling.

He done worse job tried, can't wait bites ass runs re-election. *goes show fast year gone quickly I’ve realized :P. Except really engine spreading it. many people don’t like hear many reasons. it’s headline grabbing evil scare tactics basis reality. Kind like everything far whole shitshow. agree first point, believe me, say truly asymptomatic person incapable spreading- simply they're magnitudes less capable. functionally, handful people world vaccinated, agree presymptomatic people asymptomatic people treated differently right now- everyone wearing mask distancing bare minimum. study implications vaccines impact spread- implication 95% recieve Pfizer's candidate least reduced spread. reason optimism. feeling VP take within first term *Chinese Communist Party entered chat* non-anecdotal stats prefer use? lower currently homeless population, think masking outside hanging inclosed areas helpful. see gets colder MT. 

There effort get masks them, think know fearful getting death sentence lower quality care hospitals. “Healthy” Also idea ratio hospital people LA that’s crazy, much think pop facilities would help, still need staff don’t think surplus. could blame anyone wanting go health care seeing collectively treat virus :/ Yup. That’s triage you. Focus patients best chances survival, they’re immediate danger dying move onto next one. Imagine linking fucking article 9 months ago source. Dumb fuck, friend. People waiting ambulances bed “free up?” write like it’s totally normal, what’s wrong you...

If work hospital, *is* totally normal. Clinical detachment necessity keep going nuts. (After watching training videos aimed people working emergency medicine, I'm pretty sure I'm cut stuff....)  absolutely can. I’ve thought point writing book last year sometimes reddit becomes personal diary. read data, two questions.

1. Since told, calm people new mutation?
2. long variant taken place main? nice non-verbal way say ""Don't come near me, I'm sick""

Also I'm gonna use remaining ones days feel like shaving  Herd immunity doesn’t mean one gets anymore. wtf garbage? Indeed. keep hearing skeptics say ""99.5%"" recovery rate, group would fit within. problem 0.5% *is lot fucking people*. CFR 0.5% deadliest disease hit us 100 years. even begin talk severe cases die, still require hospitalization. :,( call princess , he's man. white man could behave trump still elected president. woman 10 times qualified (and least 10 times mentally stable) win, I'm sure princess either. Well 700 people die day Texas (based interpolated US data). Based 98.3% figure, 400 people diagnosed die. added 50% daily deaths. ""Alabama, long one unhealthiest impoverished states America, emerged one nation’s alarming coronavirus hot spots.""

We walking around amnesiacs' ward. damned annoying.

The AL Governor past year stated clearly, again, AL different states. AL things ""our way, forced masks, business closures."" AL bombarded hoaxes; virus hoax; risk exaggerated.

And went on, Guv first every single holder every sub agency echo'd her. got worse.

And said NOTHING. subagencies said NOTHING.

And now, bathtub filling stopper.

AL lost cause. people sweet tea good; politics, religious commitments present near lost cause. article stated, one unhealthiest impoverished states America, may add, blinded shallow thinking, demanding reality meet fantasies, therefore kicked gutter.

Meanwhile, still get it. Biden's best forecast vaccinations 25% Nation 6 months. demand AL's infrastructure tragic high.

Let's do. Let's send thoughts prayers. Giant bathtubs full, Governor.

And end, AL learned NOTHING. Big Red attracts them. educational infrastructure continue dismal; remain tied religion ship, like slaves crossing Africa. screaming help. sell state Georgia. least may chance. stop people counting dead people tho? know people like think know better experts, getting ridiculous.

Again, data proving otherwise otherwise counteract analysis, I'd love hear it.

Note saying strain US. rampant driving current surges. indeed driver current surges, would shown sample set. Deaths Arizona went drastically weeks Thanksgiving. I’m right wing?

Feel free look post history shit Trump. 

I’m agreeing you. I’m also saying federal government drops ball, governors stepped up. HIPAA hospital social media policies wielded like weapon admins drs nurses speaking whole clusterfuck. agree. think wholly unpredictable consequence HIPAA  know longer show happening nursing homes hospitals. Yep. cheerful start seeing vaccination records instead infection records. Stop it, people getting paid stay home play video games 9 months. They're real heroes. People working 50-60 hour work weeks home yupees need fuck realize lucky are. what’s solution? Seems like you’re griping hell it. better plans distribution administration? You’re damn right fact need people vaccinated ASAFP. millions vaccinated number daily vaccinations continue rise. good thing want continue spread doom gloom. 

Yeah, house burning slowly. fire isn’t going go night complaining burning slower? 'survival' bar success? people barely survive suffer health issues rest lives? Nevermind medical bills... bad people wont able get vaccinated anyway. high, somewhere 1.1 1.4. good. Staying home, one. gathering home separate households, another. virtually long term solution, done smallpox ridding world virus... ""Can get along year?"" 

Have met humanity? Correct Wow imagine California could use biotech resources especially sequencing, could’ve identified months ago. choose ignore reality limit testing... Don’t know got downvoted fixed told people masks work save doctors bafflingly stupid doublespeak. work, save doctors? I'd worried bunch people decided get together Christmas. mean, like anybody going arrest going Grandma's house, plenty people across country claim ""really careful"" yet insisted in-person family holidays....

I guess way we'll know well LA's stay-at-home orders actually followed see many cases they've got month. know people vaccinated. Happy excited them. world California's lockdown joke? outdoor dining month. Barbers salons closed. Malls nearly crowded normal. churches I've driven closed. Streets pretty empty. UK small number approved mRNA vaccines comparison compared United States select EU member states purchased hundreds millions doses each. UK purchased 47 million doses Pfizer Moderna vaccines 100 million AZ/Oxford vaccines. That’s 2/3rds close currently approved vaccines gone, vaccines far effective winter surge. Approval AZ vaccine crucial protecting UK population winter. 

J&amp;Js phase 2 data seemed promising don’t doubt it’s phase 3 go well. don’t know much novavax data haven’t heard anything bad like Sanofis issues purity. read positivity rate still lower states, ton people, LA county huge (larger pop states) believe numbers reflect population positivity rate scientist, read lot. understanding vaccine may likely offer lifetime protection. Current mutations virus today's vaccine still handle. year two maybe not. ""It depends,"" epidemiologists's refrain think fitting here.  accurate new strain needs 70-80% less lethal vanilla strain lethality break even. likely it’s around lethality slightly less lethal, bad. it’s race vaccine new strain. part Pfizer's trial Moderna recorded efficacy single-dose effectiveness, reported 80%-90%. sample size small side, 2,000 volunteers, lines pretty well Pfizer's early stage data suggests projected 85% effectiveness single dose. get vaccinated then. choice Huh worry, governor remind posh restaurant. Command control ""from-the-top"" might work, commander playing golf full time. stands, tens millions doses sitting warehouse, waiting 

The deployment polio vaccine bunch army trucks rolling school kids lined getting assembly line style gym. 70 years ago competent US government. Jesus, what's potential R0 new variant? Seems like already around 2 4... EU Franco German empire. vaccines cannot bought Germany. You’re making possibly $45-50k/yr trying support 4 kids wife that? ever consider problems aren’t pandemic instead you’ve made shitty life decisions? You’re basically minimum wage, never meant support anything one two people. sympathy here, 24h day make choices, you’ve chosen poorly. It’s still misleading. Saying asymptomatic people don’t spread creates false sense security. Pre-symptomatic exact thing asymptomatic functionally context exposure encounters. You’re able catch people don’t active symptoms either way. it’s commonly spread way. studies aren’t really productive they’re low grade counter productive someone reads may get lax one around coughing. fighting many people argue point. may ""expected"" need believe science says otherwise.  many people can't understand nuance, saying expected sets stage. means true pace number vaccinations much higher reflected CDC tracker.

Is [Bloomberg better? least shows fresh ""Updated"" dates. Actually first health Secretary Azar said 100 million end year, 50 million, 40 million, 20 million 20 million doses reserved, 20 million 20 million reserved first week January.  Live Denver. got COVID mid-November idea got it. doctor thinks got grocery store walk something mundane like that. Could new variant since obvious exposure. Let anti maskers get back line care half suspect they’re waiting holidays want people back home &amp; back work decide new lockdown. 

Don’t forget want people keep going work &amp; kids keep going school matter what. never strict lockdown, measure never useful could be. COPD here! this. tell cue. don’t care appointment 6 months, give date. 456 damn 267 posts /r/whiterights, something see everyday since users posted suspended already. It’s would lying wasn’t. try convincing someone believes covid 19 hoax. feels like worst yet come. U.S. needs mobilize massive operation like Census trained workers come people's houses vaccinate everyone residence. Relying individuals proactively get house wait line going cut time. better Germans USSR.  Someone walked store coughed without covering wearing mask. shit gross covid total asshole move.  honestly don’t think happen lol, though wish younger president :/

Better orange alternative though. first dose, even prevent infection minority recipients, make symptom milder. gives immune system head start.

So sense first dose offer protection. second dose increases protection, importantly reduce virus spread achieve herd immunity. J&amp;J single shot probably governments need hit projected timelines.

AZ probably lost lot confidence public releasing different numbers. need clean/large phase 3. Hopefully trial running US goes better. disagree points protect people. downvoted? needs managed.

People getting two vaccines telling doctor another already. 
People getting second dose vaccine. 
People getting 3 doses.

On top that, people adverse effects result behavior spreading conspiracies online.

Having robust database vaccinations vital success vaccine campaign. 0.2% population vaccinated 🙄 Doubling time bro. 

Vaccine nation-wide by, late-Summer.

If we'd gotten eyes thing cases new variant active restricted flights UK point, we'd reasonable chance preventing new strain spreading widely vaccine usage got us near herd immunity levels.

Probably would save quite lives.  r/Coronavirus died covid. 

It’s relevant.  late already ring alarms nobody listen Well based 5heads it’s simple supply issue. 300million vials people magically become vaccinated tens millions week. believe, association minks, change made fit physiology, mutation bled back. Think way: 

A really really tiny mist droplet bleach tongue wont kill you, drink tall glass it, goodbye. 

Depending many viruses get system, may may enough make sick fashion. Apparently new strain efficient doesnt need many viruses enter make sick. better vaccinate fast mutates. common sense. need see data that.... news? Iowa running 30% + quite time. many patients gift shop, certain extent care rationed. can't give good care patients circumstances. spring surge NY hospital took transfers another hospital overwhelmed like patients piled conference rooms. Many patients received terrible shape clearly receiving appropriate care, barley made us alive. agree mink farms need closed. examples people across planet hunt use animals survival different. Apologies making clear enough.

Sometimes people believe animal hunting needs stop, however peoples rely trapping hunting survival. Ah, it’s natural selection action, got it. really surprised? US done well far regarding COVID? makes think vaccine rollout would better? Even new administration hits ground running, going take get everything sorted out. relying one vaccine? spike taper off.

But seem trend reverses spike? see rate new infections go back spike, see would go below.

An alternative explanation holidays people less likely get tested deaths get reported right away. holidays rush get tested deaths get reported bulk, giving appearance spike, actual change course pandemic. Oh yes mess. Bad copy paste. Never mind think time go bed now. obviously needing sleep sorry that. retraced steps see bad paste happened. don’t get medical school C’s. spelling isn’t mutually exclusive intelligence. 

I’m fairly intelligent person, great GPA top university, spelling goes shit I’m tired. started! tell get liver disease become alcoholic spite me?

Quit whining *They’re picture.* Lol nothing slow down. Operation warp speed said would vaccinate 20 million people jan 1st. 18 million short This. It’s often said reason showing Vietnam war tv turned public it. 

Far many People don’t care covid hasn’t personally affected them. Know 3 good point flu shot made affordable even free many people, take advantage get flu shot every year, makes going work much safer us wish could get one! Used supervisor CVS. can't imagine going right now. could barely get things done pandemic. big thing going either superbug incurable AMR. Bet way virus gone ,or enough vaccines given open summer. Maybe average shitty citizen doesnt want go near even though theyre also human ... way theyre non-covid bubble. outside contact people go places easy tranmission Yea want cut losses. Toss kids get brand spankin’ new healthy ones. patient asked virus real forgotten next door neighbor died Covid-19. want hoax bad deny facts support narrative.  Also, know straw man is.  Assume would “caught” it. hell would changed? Welp shits go strain worst something virus killed many age ranges, continue so. frequency younger deaths occur orders magnitude less risk ages. Makes wonder take one data point doesn’t represent average, create headline it. Watch get dumped teams deal insurance able get away calling covid related symptoms pre-existing conditions.

Such sad fucking country. Give 5 years everyone realizes “well shit shoulda passed M4A“ americans wind long term health conditions covid. wife getting vaccinated tomorrow mil next week! One worst strawman arguments I’ve ever seen. Take care know someone past couple days they’ve taken weird liking color red, vodka, tyranny communism. Meh maybe it’s phase I’ll getting mine motherland can! mutation we're already fucked sorts ways years this. mutation make things worse people get it, even vaccine. anything, increased fear covid probably good thing helps people take seriously. people giving fug probably there's gonna huge post-holiday spike mean education agree 10000%. Coupled ignorance love conspiracy theories ... yikes. 

If you’re focused shipping MTFs put usage zero significant issues. Trained team. Accepted vaccine. Created strict schedule vaccinate 300 people per day without violating insanely restrictive temperature regulations. 

Wasn’t perfect ... smooth nonetheless. Also means prior infections start play bigger role suppression. assume even additional testing, contact tracing, forth we're still missing half infections (which think extremely conservative given many people symptoms, mild symptoms may warrant testing), we're looking hundreds thousands new infections week right now. idiots already think non-Covid deaths marked Covid said dead people gator shits! gators ate got many bodies?! So... sort explains poor performance multiple pro athletes... need find vaccine causes well Wait hospitals gift shops? is, always. Also, fun fact, never get life insurance it. 23 virus. 32 years old denied every time I've applied it. Especially sucks kids worry about. God damn, articles beyond useless.

*No fucking shit* vaccination rates slower right now- basically *just started*. that, vaccines way, vaccines approved, significantly easier make distribute.

Who actually thinks rate vaccination remain weeks turn months? Uninformed doomscrollers click articles, that’s it. exactly him?
He got virus patients, received medical treatment every one else. ""treatment"" received, medical treatment three thousand infected medical workers Wuhan. didn`t get fired arrested like poor medical workers America. eleven colleagues thing him, don`t even know name alive can`t political weapon! care Li!

Actually CCP haters like feel happy death use political weapon, disgusting. first jab fine. uppercut really took out.  sister’s hospital cancelled brain surgery cancer surgery icu beds recovery. Rescheduling uncertain. Kinds things can’t wait long. are. like, y'know infectious Queen's ""Under Pressure"" is?

Well BioNTech basically Vanilla Ice. 

They took recognizable riff copied it. assembled synthetic pseudo-song around it. sorta sounds like music, close enough think song. missing *something.* ear-worm, *song* song want share. 

Like, goes karaoke night queues ""Ice Ice Baby?""

It make propagate it. Songs supposed that.

But insistent kinda gets stuck head. *annoying* - even good song annoying one gets annoying really fast. Almost like engineered way.

So manage get rid it. Find something else listen to. come across repulsive.

Unfortunately (well, fortunately we're talking Covid) ""Ice Ice"" thing reminds ""Under Pressure."" kinda ruins spell Alright stop, collaborate listen  Ice back brand new invention  Something grabs hold tightly  Flow like harpoon daily nightly  ""Will ever stop?"" Yo know  ... gators duh ^/s Different generation, friend. anyone else feel biggest problem recently?

The vaccine available general public what, 3-4 months? vaccinated decent amount population right. Imagine messaging people get vaccinated, deaths drop; deaths drop go back normal. I'm saying everyone start following restrictions, least people might.

Instead messaging ""the vaccine prevent transmission"", ""masks distancing year vaccine"", ""COVID never go away"". surprised fuck ton younger people saying ok going i'll take chances COVID? answer simple shit article doesn’t conclusive statement cause.

Diabetes kills within “hours” two conditions: Diabetic Keto Acidosis (often Type 1 diabetics, uncommon especially pediatrics) Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State (often elderly Type 2). similar conditions alters body’s metabolic state enter coma due brain edema results disturbance. Infection missing doses lead state DKA prevalent thanks modern medicine, 100% treatable (I haven’t seen single case die personal experience never heard one either colleagues).

I would personally assume death happened patients already poor blood sugar control article US healthcare system shit people fat. Diabetics prone heart disease outcomes usually worse. important note diabetes masks typical symptoms heart attacks. personal guess silent heart attacks patients poor diabetic control lost access medications regular care.

This sub really stop voting based policies actually think writing misinformation like this. Suggest replace asymptomatic ""apparently asymptomatic."" Covid fuck lungs organs without showing symptoms noticed time. stroke dying heart attack 30s 40s month immune system beats Covid19 symptom too. Yeah. I'm Nebraska feel like anything differently one day, cases dropped r0 fell 1. think key strenuous activity inflammation resolves high-risk. Many don’t realize well. Roughly speaking NYC population 8 million, metro area population 20 million (ny, nj, pa). LA population 3 million. It’s metro area 13 million (la, Long Beach, Anaheim). Going logic NYC it’s surrounding areas much deeper shit. thankfully aren’t. It’s competent people competent leaders. 

I’m saying CA governor isnt. don’t know handled situation, maybe phenomenal job. don’t know people responded either. don’t know CA timeline. I’m saying Cuomo strict covid since day one. didn’t bullshit. metro area followed suite. people same. Thus drastic different results. Cuomo hero responding like one.

(FWIW, 12 recommended vaccines doc chose three plus bi-weekly regimen intravenous vitamin C try mitigate effects.) took year get back normal-ish. can't take steroids hypersensitive (they make suicidal). also (very luckily) able work home indefinitely, time making decision vaccine. doc talked trying devise plan minimize risk. likely due differences male female immune systems. number things going on.

First prioritizing hospital workers administration hospital staff took strained resources asked distribute this.

The pharmacies supposed next ramping nursing homes.

It seems virtually trained people set free standing vaccines clinics (like testing). may partially refrigeration requirements Pfizer especially exist mostly hospitals. Moderna could use good restaurant walk freezer store. 

Another hurdle allergic reactions watching people 15 minutes.

Finally reporting stinks. know numbers way lower what’s actually given can’t exactly make judgments bad data.

So hurdles stuff figured I’m guessing end Jan. naturally new federal leadership.

By Feb huge hurdle available doses. You’ve got J&amp;J track approval then, Oxford might get approval well. There’s candidates might force companies make proven one. 

I’d say June July attainable.  You’ve got every medical professional, pharmacy, 50 governors soon President working solve problem.  It’s impossible challenges solved get better week week. Projecting first difficult weeks rate progress absurd. naturally expect week get better (look guys figured bottles tons extra medicine). people figure game changer quickly spread improved everywhere. Places start innovate holidays things work spread quickly. BERLIN (Reuters) - number confirmed coronavirus cases Germany increased 22,459 1,687,185, data Robert Koch Institute (RKI) infectious diseases showed Wednesday. reported death toll rose 1,129 32,107, tally showed. Depending upon choose diagram text, here's breaks down:

- We've wrecked *our planet*...
- *no long term plans *
- *beyond* 1/2 generation. 
- *Greed selfishness* control. 

All topics beyond covid.

Basic stuff here. Really difficult. Seriously. Newsom assumed Barbers shutdown...what...10 months now? would pay mortgage/rent? plan well thought let’s blame Trump move guess. caught flu 24 healthy, even though shot season. turned opportunistic pneumonia, heart failure. tough climb back, many times thought sure would die. really traumatizing. want ever go something like again. Didnt ACA make preexisting conditions didnt disqualify anyone health insurance doesn’t every long term care facility med nurse RN? heard thought dumbest idea ever. I’ve never seen pharmacist Walgreens CVS sitting around—or sitting all. subject post, article sub? users rushing shame, please don’t. guy died. judge/make point later. supposed take seriously healthcare workers time dance around TikTok day It’s survey world economic forum.

I assume it’s talking little day day covid precautions. seeing mentioned think it’s worth noting: stuff liquid gold I’m sure security concerns slowing process even bit. Cases exploding area. whole family got it, mom got tested time test positive. Everyone exact symptoms. keep hearing friends family testing positive. Doomscrollers love add Reddit vocabulary. It’s like testing slow picked speed time went on. figured would pickup speed. Plus new administration certainly help speed things get inoculation process moving Corpses can't work Oh shit last intubated/soon die patients

I'm sorry coworkers going this. Thank take care.  Bruh wanna go library Don’t worry, morons vote President. fail upwards US politics.  5 people estimate saw first dose gets 90% protection second dose seems likely getting second dose 12 months later still get extra bit protection, delaying, foregoing.

Is source either these? want believe, can't believe reddit comment without source. much false information days. ask prove actually real ER physician.....just take word it.....  sequel. Lots people gone university system either, required vaccinations date plus flu shot otherwise make appointment get shots. allows estimate well testing going picking positives community.

So test 10,000 people get 1000 positives, fairly certain many positives community, busy spreading virus far wide. However test 10,000 people get 2 positives much certain large numbers undiscovered positives wandering around.

And particularly important next stage, contact tracing isolating disease. 2 10,000 case clamp disease, contact trace 2 kill clusters. 1000 positives effective control - disease spread even put 1000 isolation know many there, resources job properly.

Thus numbers say positivity rates less 5%, scale testing closer keeping scale disease. Though personally think need see positivity rates less 1% - otherwise taking seriously enough cannot expect eradicate it. That's good analogy. Antibiotics kill bacteria already present. taking full course allows harder kill bacteria remain grow spread again. Vaccines deterrent infection preparing body able attack real virus encountered. make sense half-dose spawn new virus variants. concern would even considered human level. 


It however still good question whether single dose effective. vaccine confers immunity \~50% recipients single dose, could cause harm good people assuming they're safe leading increased infection rates. rate protection high enough, valuable get many people possible level protection even receive second dose.  article...

Over past months, Letlow posted numerous photos dozens others campaign community events without masks without social distancing. also pushed states ""reopen economy"" amid pandemic. Fuck you. stupid piece shit. “Playing right wing” blah blah blah. fucking moron. isn’t fucking R. people’s lives cunt. Newsom piece shit snake. gives fuck Trump? He’s out. Enjoy Biden Harris whoever. guess what? They’re none going better. 

Go get fucked. stupid cunt. honestly thought someone else answering facetiously checked usernames bother anyone else random person Reddit better able explain article author article? new way thinking. Remember climate change? Green new deals? Progressive thinking?

A large chunk country trying move new direction while. vaccination rate slow better chance catching disease getting vaccinated. Aren’t testing insane amount people also like frozen meat fish? ... uh .... yeah? 

I’d kill anything/anyone live alternative too? would animals..... could past months, Letlow posted numerous photos dozens others campaign community events without masks without social distancing. also pushed states ""reopen economy"" amid pandemic. get couple flu variants year, vaccination 4 possible candidates (In Germany; formerly 3). vaccines 40 % effective. severe flu 1/5 severe Covid people reluctant get shot, shot ineffective next year.

The first Corona vaccines 90 % effective known variants. yet know weather shot last year. Depending hospital, true. comment also completely misses point here. doesn’t matter occupancy usually is. matters run time demand increasing rather decreasing. means begin making choices gets ICU necessary instruments, ventilators. I'm shitting Cuomo's response agree handled COVID lot better governors country. comment intended illustrate California, matter does, rough time sheer number people there. reservoir That's rough. Sorry loss. Number 2 physically possible. can’t big lockdown. people need groceries, go hospitals etc. can’t stop contagious virus starts. slow spread masks staying home, therapies vaccines out. virus starts, time realize would’ve already spread many places much travel world Right, real point research needed inducing panic. It’s already here. feel anxiety eating 100% time 25 dollars paying pocket, that's expensive? Yep! personally know maybe 10-12 people gotten vaccinated I’m past week. way we've ignored kids pandemic going felt decades come. That’s thought well. teenager Uh .... coronavirus sub ..... talking post covid ....... covid literally biggest mess plates right say true big name media companies hiring people go good writing/communication programs. friend died back April, exactly one week saw him. completely healthy, rock climber, mountain biker, etc. pre existing heart condition found admitted hospital, died two days later. 32. lived “heart condition” without ever knowing. scared group friends much hyper vigilant stay safe. live music bars clubs probably come back before. huge stadium concerts might right (in US least). maybe late year Houston, problem. could stab Brit, Australian, New Zealander, Canadian defend court saying ""I jabbing them! protecting people diseases crime now?"" study Germany cited endlessly every media outlet think of, knowledge hasn’t really peer reviewed cardiologists say research needed drawing conclusions that.

I read something researchers posted saying expected maybe thousand hits study, it’s gotten like hundreds thousands views online. work Cheat Lake one shop wears masks properly -- -- couple conspiracy folks building too. get there. changes. yes discard things practices proven harmful. also take things past proven beneficial useful. always way every generation. though still stop bleeding first. careful exactly changes changes it, could turn r/hailcorporate time..

Why? Yes, Paul Alexander July 2020 said administratiin wanted infection spreading quickly far herd immunity. even get it? new president weeks mutates time. start vaccinating push mutate vaccine build defences, want vaccinate fast, vaccinate se good enough time. 12 weeks apart worry.. 3 vaccines less year pretty incredible. 5 count Sputnik sinopharm possible partially totally immune people end spreading selecting mutations tender vaccine inert.

So straight forward making it. 30 history allergic reactions vaccines. 15 answer questions. Depends state seems. mine, vaccines given hospitals healthcare workers. people catching COVID wasn’t evidence? Covid chance die it. People receive one dose fully immune. question whether enough useful detrimental. could detrimental fight virus, fight hard enough, might give enough time build defences attack. understanding following immunologists Twitter initial immunity fade away unless exposed antigen second time. primary purpose second dose really increase efficacy make immunity longer lasting. vaccine also much cheaper, easier store prevent Pfizer making entire countries hostages. I’m sure weaponized. don’t really see point weaponizing covid since there’s already host better options biological warfare. problem heart damage heals... badly. scaring makes worse. Let's see 26 competitive athletes, 4 (15%) CMR findings suggestive myocarditis 8 additional athletes (30.8%) exhibited LGE without T2 elevation suggestive prior myocardial injury. COVID-19–related myocardial injury competitive athletes sports participation remains unclear. 

late gadolinium enhancement = [is MRI method scanning dead heart tissue help specialists determine damage reversible = heart trouble, inflamed. happens long time high intensity without treatement, heart muscle may end healing badly, real problem... [it's heart ""scarring"" (fibrosis), scar tissue permanent reduces heart inflammation heart muscle (myocardium). Myocarditis affect heart muscle heart's electrical system, reducing heart's ability pump causing rapid abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias).

Remember early reports COVID-19 higher pulse? Well, that's tied myocarditis. Viruses, even cold seasonal flu, known this, also tick-borne diseases. ""Cardio"" sports also known stress heart cause James O’Keefe, Saint Luke’s Hospital Kansas City, US, led review evidence, “Physical exercise, though drug, possesses many traits powerful pharmacologic agent. routine daily physical activity highly effective prevention treatment many diseases, including coronary heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, obesity. “However, pharmacologic agent, safe upper-dose limit potentially exists, beyond adverse effects physical exercise, musculoskeletal trauma cardiovascular stress, may outweigh benefits.” research published June issue Mayo Clinic Proceedings.

Athletic cardiac adaptation could responsible abnormalities; however, cohort, mean (SD) T2 suspected myocarditis 59 (3) milliseconds vs 51 (2) milliseconds without, favoring pathology.

They say inconclusive, since heart damage could also physical exercise there's pre-COVID scan compare with.

Really, two ways measure future COVID-19: looking actually heart scans looking healthy history serious infections intensive physical exercise (probably children). 

They mention [another focused patient's initial COVID-19 test negative, repeat test positive. ECG showed myocardial injury due viral infection heart failure symptoms exacerbated viral infection.

""Most children COVID-19 either asymptomatic mild symptoms, **our case shows potential reversible myocardial injury infants COVID-19**. Testing COVID-19 children presenting signs symptoms heart failure important learn impact virus.""

Emphasis added. I'm sure called reversible, maybe treated it, brings larger point assuming ""children safe COVID-19"". Meanwhile, EMA postpones makes month later. proactive means asking data, there's need that. wanted wait 15 minutes flu shot year. Pretty sure they’ll say it’s recommended sit waiting room 15 minutes leave feel fine. course, leave right away that’s fine. inform cover butt Garden Route here, 2 close friends already died COVID large friends group safely assume people friends tragedies. crazy many people (even warned restrictions could get worse) still walk around without masks masks chins, even stores. wonder really still people atleast know person gone sort suffering due COVID care even friends family. Republican Administration failure. Period. keep wondering it’s new strain UK identified. It’s much easier spread apparently. know announced first strain Colorado sure it’s already California?? Meanwhile, EU... quarantine I’m constantly surrounded people going out? It’s okay symptoms anyway won’t able tell difference first dose heavy lifting.

It's 50% effective first dose. Better nothing, good overall. turtle headed fuck mcconnell. startled $2000 check retreated shell. cited actual numbers confirm typing one word, five characters, google.

""covid"" Every CS collectively: 

""I NUKE!"" eternal ""it something""... Imagine USA could accomplishing right now, president. Quarantine week two. Wear masks visiting. Seriously ruining mental health worth it. Well, massive federal undertaking. States step find resources get done.

My state, California, wealthiest populous state apparently comprehensive plan whatsover rolling vaccine. amazing read. must know way words.

I’m RN Covid unit. love Foley part. laughed hard. feel same. battling
Covid myself, idea going back isn’t sitting well. suppose silver lining laid hard it’ll little while. 

Man, guy said doesn’t Covid, simply bronchitis gets yearly sounds familiar. Many variations story, it’s still basically tale. 

Or don’t want anyone know sick enough inpatient Covid. ‘Don’t tell kids it’s Covid’... fun super spreaders name 1 nRNA vaccine using Covid technology

you cannot . none. really sure comment. read article British variant likely driven immunocompromised people. vaccine/your immune system thing, virus crushed, chance evolve. partially reopened, restricted fully weeks ago. I'm saying retail nonessential. Companies told employees heros without actually anything make safer working pandemic. I'm sorry junk. Pfizer/Biontech Moderna alone probably enough US, still others coming easier use including single dose vaccine. getting competent people White House soon, coordination messaging might improve. pay effects pandemic years come, hopeless. Condolences nuke... gets progressively worse. comments purely political “zingers,” policy-oriented.

""Then certainly good thing we're going speed up!""

You're hypocrite. even saying, course live normal life COVID... becomes endemic. one wants live perpetual lockdown, I'd fucking rather get virus take chance every year. Fuck that. Many med students rotating high risk rotation like emergency ICU, even resident doctors gotten vaccine. Many haven’t even given timeline it. totally unacceptable. According Bloomberg 15,000,000 doses sitting storage various states right now. 

Many states botching actually getting HARD. Like Iowa 142,000 we've actually administered 8400 strange new records happening around world day. Almost like planned it. true. Biden administration take power start working functional rational vaccination program planning started months ago. Nope.

 

What sort non medical field work in? involve wildly overconfident guessing? one ""tricked"", needed paycheck whole thing job. Seems like tricked big retail companies using employees covid marketing schemes assuming workers see right bullshit employers pushing there. Truth though, working class get protections working home showed backbone country world matter. discount people, know what's up. really need institute kind verification system, companies need bar entry based vaccination status. COVID vaccine? Well can’t shop store. COVID vaccine? Well forget getting sporting event. Etc. fully. Indoor dining social distance permitted. Recently judge ruled indoor dining legal, recent restaurants largely kept earlier policies.

This may Thanksgiving rolling college kids coming home rolling Christmas. 3% male female applied overall population still significant. That's unlikely, way would one single advantage: forcing progress prevention treatment protocols, better testing methods.

All money put one basket: vaccines. that's right. diversified more. Spanish flu thought first major H1N1 influenza strain affected humans. Variants thereof became one seasonal influenzas, others spread swine. usual seasonal flu vaccine designed year fight 3-4 different flu strains, one always H1N1 strain. think : really necessary shitty bot google translate English articles English? use doses they’re ready given matters most? worst time respiratory viruses right now. Sure they’ll 350 million doses ready eventually that’s long way right million doses mRNA vaccines lot AZ vaccines. understand cruel calculus MHRA forced right truth AZ *zero* data effective vaccine people 55 dosing plan give in. wiser approve emergency use given circumstances? don’t know probably, I’m qualified make call. certainly approving something without data troubling. Page 28: We've done damn good job acquiring cases world, second third countries ***combined!*** That's America know. Number 1 baby.

***Hard fucking /s*** case someone missed sarcasm. Israel face given much smaller population

Percentages care absolute values. That's *why* use percentages begin with.

""We can't we're bigger"" really means ""I pay attention math class back high school"". According 2011 Indian Census India 51.5% men 48.5% women. little 2 full doses 12 weeks apart I'll concede governors going partying total crap. Fck politicians. I’m LA area articles dumb. Let know high percentage test positive month second dose. Far many People don’t care covid hasn’t personally affected them.

My brother law like this. Even friend wife got it, got sick basically thinks big deal. Yeah, well still Trump administration uncaring disconnecting ever before. always Dad, it? won't. Gonna keep around get cold. lot less testing reporting due holidays, look 7 day averages positive rate numbers already known Denmark mink outbreak, fuck done anything prevent shit??? fuck. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Hope US follows. severe allergies I'd rather take vaccine even little less effective Yes, numbers joke.

NYC celebrated straight face single day vaccination record ~12000. joke? They're going nearly 400k doses end year they're celebrating 12k/day? Uh, precedent means event unprecedented.

By definition. hope imply non-danger terms non infectious agent others potentially becoming spreader! MedCram lectures good run Pfizer mode action right - time unblinding trial, observation active mRNA vaccine severe covid responses infection, however ability calcinated person contract she'd viral particles without becoming I'll concluded. know studies advanced point known I'm assuming unknown. personal opinion especially period second jab, anyone first injection full protection still risk. second injection, recipient moves group confidence exposure covid result adverse illness still potential silent spreader (unless science confirms otherwise). 

The UK first 2nd round general public vaccination data clinical trials. I'm yet see guidance given second injection, thoughts leads think basics face coverings, social distancing etc still applies regardless vaccination risk asymptomatic silent spread still stands. lead potential culture think way thinking first injection automatically makes cross finish line pandemic precautionary measures instantly stop applying - would major risk everyone. 

If I'm implying I'm non-danger others, I'd put reference "" require hospitalisation medical care would endanger medical staff"", vaccine suddenly makes immune without consequence anyone else. I'm glad see decade still easy spot nuke people. always tell you. anticipated “Christmas bump” hasn’t even begun. Won’t long get stories rich, powerful connected hopping front line families little anything punitive authorities promising investigate being“shocked upset” breach procedure. weird since told today healthy people get Covid. get Covid, 99.9% chance survival. Anyone dies old fat expected. live NJ, can't imagine places like. Anyone link actual study? Antibody prevalence rates necessarily translate entire population way. uk approve getting final efficacy data?

Bit sus, maybe patriotism going imo. numerous issues phase 3 trials, including massaging numbers could get best possible result.

They found half full dose combo gave best case scenario protection 90 percent. tested regimen small subset cohorts. Meaning 90 percent figure much larger margin error 60 percent standard dose returned.

I thought needed full scale phase 3 trial 90 percent dosage regulators would approve it.

All said, probably administer knowing proven safe think feel comfortable Oxford vaxx. Question- you’ve original Covid-19, kind protection variant? read vaccine covers sure whatever antibodies one’s body produce? Absolutely! Deaths fall well usual flu levels plus many people already corona level natural immunity, numbers low. get Covid vaccine Walmart. may gotten flu shot walmarts currently performing Covid vaccinations month we'll major leadership changes make entirely doable, long activity requires additional funding congress. they're done, send staff US teach us properly carryout vaccination program? need help state like Iowa utah vaccinate around 30k per day. worry immunity wear partway get start again! :D Praying 🙏🏾 Lyndsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Joni Ernst, Mike Pence sure aren’t complaining, they’ve already gotten vaccinations. Maybe know something Tenessee nurse (Tiffany Dover) got vaccine, fainted then... disappeared, went missing mysteriously.

And thus choose wait see months. faces existential threat since mortal enemies

Are speaking Iran? something? Ahmed Jenin overthrowing government time soon. annoyance, includes damn settlers. already is. supposed hit 20 million vaccine doses end December. Currently less 3 million. zero large scale planning Federal level. ship batches states (and even fucking up) state come plan. Alien hand syndrome might kinda cool. So, start half dose full dose? may change January. Easy solution....rapid test required boarding. Add cost ticket government subsidize rest. fail denied clear standard test. Americanastupid. started. Jesus h Christ give time. arrivals get fucked click bait. federal policy experience shift. Biden mobilize army aid vaccination without Congress. kind primary function executive command army. somebody told They’ve ones buying thousand-acre plots building compounds, buying stockpiles middle Wyoming, Dakotas, etc

And whinging lockdowns wearing masks, none preppers could actually handle live bunker. Lol yes Yes agreed, parents right behind first wave vaccinations; probably get Feb. feel like I’ll able breathe knowing they’re safe. They’re perfectly healthy 70 year olds want remain way. able see much well. Politicians time. Lying taking kernel truth context rile base guy. make good true. logistic curve certain type mathematical curve shaped kinda like case inflection point probably 70 80 percent instead 50 percent overall shape holds true. felt tired next day, called sick work. probably could’ve gone due work policy staying home don’t feel well stayed home.

My temperature went 97 98.5, slightly elevated fever. minor chills woke 4am feeling like going throw up. 5 minutes nausea went away went back sleep. 12 hours felt okay again. couple times next days would randomly feel tired would last like 5 minutes I’d okay again.

Keep mind back August. second dose September felt little tired next day it. 
Today feel great issues. Thank god you’re like students finding reasons go every weekend! Politicians time. Lying taking kernel truth context rile base guy. make good true.  Great questions! 

I best suited answer second question say charitable giving data indicates people invest causes 1) directly affect community (ie, local) 2) something invested deeply care about. Fostering sense connection caring education shown one effective methods bring actionable change.

As second question, part, yes! Zoos lose accreditation keep animal welfare. best part that, community, constantly striving expand understanding means actually ""provide better care"". example, used believed ""happy"" animals provided needs for. ample space, never wanted food water, never exposed negative stimuli stress, best case scenario. know simply enough! Animals need mental stimulation enrichment (the chance act species specific behaviors) thrive! know accredited zoos training animals using positive reinforcement even participate health well exams? many cases longer nessisary restrain animal blood draw, foot check, even radiographs! imagine took time pets go discomfort fear yearly vet checks? guess trying get modern accredited zoos leading edge animal welfare training, research, conservation, education. learn more, better. certainly zoos level yet. touch last point, past two years Denver zoo started moving away housing ""common"" species need protection (although always charismatic species shown well captivity probably still exhibit zoos regardless population status).  Wasnt masks supposed fix hypothetical bro. spreading false information. 

It's like saying ""Yea I'll try skydiving, pigs fly"" 

Pigs likely going start flying COVID likely going eradicated. real issue humans (especially western westernized countries) outright refuse make things worse inconvenience. Also governments need actually prepare event communicate dangers public rouge actors control narrative make things worse.

This thing could’ve completely mitigated aggressive Australia New Zealand

No matter one says Australia New Zealand showed aggressive efforts better communication put thing western world. 

We foolish think lockdown reopen continuously control. one chance lockdown population make things worse stop caring Kiwis Aussies know salute it.  I'm fine healthcare providers focusing vaccinating people reporting numbers later. went second use word ""obligatory"" rhetorical symmetry, absolutism. I'm passing value judgment jokes serious issues without sarcasm flags. I'd like said stand own. valid thing consider without invalidating joke. I'm interested arguing. supposed get tetanus shot every 10 years. ""Personal responsibility"" also wastewater testing check covid 19 general also check variants could severe way. vaccines take month become effective takes time you’re body produce antibodies,
Hopefully people fooled misleading headline. Christmas weekend. unreasonable backlog Christmas. Please stop making America look bad implying reporting consistently lousy. is, especially since nursing homes getting vaccines. Numbers really start ramp up. hospital done 7 thousand vaccines, Ive noticed vaccines become available way healthcare workers. Moderna entering game huge. much easier distribute due longer shelf life. get soon you’re eligible it’s offered you. Go get shot!

I hate phrasing way, people high risk also high risk hospitalization, takes hospital bed resources. mention personal hardships illness, medical bills, outcome — would (likely) costly lower risk person. aren’t stealing shot someone, you’d part vaccinating avoid becoming seriously ill. Nah probably already got vaccine Looking variance counties, could artifact negatives getting processed.

I know Florida gamed numbers best able to, reading much one day data. kind sequencing - NIH CDC, university research labs. graphical webapp - actually first detect U.S, back February, going around back public health departments contacting friend flu samples.

The scientist behind NextStrain [Twitter yesterday addressing this. yesterday (obviously things changed today), 112 samples collected December, 0 UK variant, yielding upper bound 2% U.S. potentially infected new strain. 0 1776 samples collected November new strain well. Also 0 24 LA samples new variant, unlikely new strain driving surge California.

Kinda surprised too, that's data says.  probably won’t happen means true pace number vaccinations much higher reflected CDC tracker. fear mongering.

The vaccine isnt prevent infections, prevent severity symptoms possibly prevent viral shedding. Yep, mandatory crew quarantine. One could argue imposing mandatory quarantine arrivals limiting number quarantine spaces available, government *in effect* denied New Zealanders right return. compounded fact MIQ booking tied specific day airlines accepting bookings flights later cancel.

It's shitty situation Kiwis caught overseas right justified feeling aggrieved, people also serious risk country recognize lucky option climbing aboard lifeboat. Per capita Israel UK vaccinated more.  seems like would small amount people page, obesity/overweight alone 73% adults. I'm remaining 27% yet still condition 2nd list. time said done, every town U.S. coronavirus hotspot. Who's going take next week? I'm same. tend mild general discomfort couple days fine.  Ok Ummm UK Israel done people per capita. referring article published see article, tables describe different outcomes, far numerous list mild case flu, potentially ""severe"" outcomes, listed OP's comment side effet stands GENERALLY one side effect symptom virus hand would reaction vaccine.

That original commenter suggesting though. re-read original comment, said: effects =/= unsafe  may feel bad danger.

Which categorically false, since indeed danger, listed CDC article, outlines numerous types ""severe"" response, well ""Serious Adverse Events"" section

You claim semantic grounds ""danger"", think reasonable person would agree ""severe"" outcomes ""Serious Adverse Events"" would quantify ""danger"". Would agree disagree that? somebody explain fossils like 2 years left live receives vaccine young? nobody work set test negative retested 2-3 times week. Hmm. headlines say? feel like American's go ""Oh shit"" deaths reach 1 million. UK Israel per capita though. Yuck, means via community spread, right? based I'd say statistical model show everyone vaccinated tomorrow. mean growing infinite percentage.

And began pandemic end. shitty models made computer programmer business anything remotely related health. Stop stop he's already dead headaches, diziness, nauseous feeling great 2nd 3rd nights dose 1. reaction dose 2. Maybe placebo arm soreness either time? tell side effects?   remember cases seemed better August/September; nice downward trend. October now, whole wreck. Spoiler alert: single day *December 23*, full six days ago.

That's date data is, even local level — we're reporting vaccinations six days ago.  Read wrote again. Lol many triggered entitled commentators. want return pay it, plenty opportunity year.

Just like Aussies stranded overseas begging government fork bill charter flight get home. varies state; find state plan online. vaccines work it’s possible covid becomes akin cold flu. Especially treatments improve. We’ve come long way year. 

The virus also likely eventually evolve. doesn’t mean go away, mean might lose lot edge become another cold strain. Masks sure vaccine widespread proven effective though.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Yeah state behind times. states decriminalizing drugs legalizing psychedelics mental heath treatment state still figuring tax *shit* people want get high lol Sure, here's another one month half Still, scientists might already observed evolutionary change virus, though apparently direction increased transmissibility, lower virulence. team led Bette Korber, computational biologist Los Alamos National Laboratory, published paper journal Cell July showing strain carrying mutation identified D614G appeared replacing initial strain first emerged Wuhan, China. Korber team suggested that, basis research — conducted cells culture — new strain seemed infectious original. paper notes limitations ""infectiousness transmissibility always synonymous,"" Korber says findings consistent higher Similarly, people infected SARS-CoV-2 seem capable infecting others experiencing symptoms. sly mode viral spread may make evolution lower virulence less likely, infected asymptomatic people perfect mobile viral delivery systems.

Also supporting position. turn provide evidence supports unsourced opinion. BEGINS Nope. listed ""might be"". In. MA, means even third group vaccinated. still ahead line terms general roll out, behind groups. Great news. hope ramp reflected across country people raging China's wet markets now??? BTW US wet markets someone dies measles, whooping cough, preventable diseases extinct now, thank man. lot people thought, probably still think otherwise.

There 'end game' this... people generally decide whatever measures. 

Masks social distancing stay. could PS5 inventory sold Best Buy 1300 Playstations? point time vaccine proven keep others safe case get virus. possible still get virus, symptoms able spread others sure hope end 2021 things much better!  elections consequences.  think statement one regurgitated time again, requires 0 critical thinking generally spouted people really know anything depth topic question, would like sound smart.  


Not saying that's you, i'm saying generally. SARS-1 MERS infection conferred long term immunity, point immune cells SARS-1 patients 15 years ago reacted SARS-2 introduced. Plenty documentation online look studies, they've widely cited. Ok, looked up. Here's SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus causes COVID-19 disease, sidesteps evolutionary trade-off. Symptoms often don’t appear infected people spreading virus several days. One study SARS-CoV-2 estimated highest rate viral shedding, therefore transmissibility, one two days person infected begins show Put simply, feel ill virus accomplished evolutionary goal: spread.

So, exactly said. Remember (WHO) wouldn’t declare pandemic? That’s completely lost shred credibility. pisses much, Oxford/AZ's trial data procedures clearly lacking, yet looks like we're approving UK others aren't.

Will way reject Oxford/AZ vaccine if/when time comes, get assigned that? I'm pretty low risk anyway mind waiting longer vaccine Yeah know likely scenario :( thread handy? Waiting year four pandemic finally done good   Oh come on. congressmen state aren’t standing way wife getting shot. idea talking about. Go ask wife hasn’t gotten shot yet. guarantee it’s people congress state got instead.

Regardless, Congress getting shots early actually good thing even it’s hypocritical. want public faith vaccines people actually get them. leader getting vaccine public eye increases public’s trust. Railing Congress low hanging fruit. Let’s lose sight big picture. Also, vaccines weren’t designed sterilizing immunity. reason expect stop virus transmission, spread mutates escape vaccines’ effects places know patients are, doctors nurses hand give shots.

Logistics doesn’t get easier first weeks. exactly. December, Google’s mobility data shows huge drops traffic retail/recreation (-76%), groceries/pharmacies (-56%), workplaces (-82%) compared normal, fellow Floridians ones responsible keeping infection numbers down. strong opinions weak sourcing. Looking posting history obsessed AZ vaccine. Hey good news once? Every post doom gloom. message board depressing.  No. Nobody ever told should, never really thought year. It’s called jab dude That's benefit intentionally vague. World leaders....learning?? 

Rinse, Wash repeat 10 years.  “leaders” say “We DiDnT KNoW” Terrible question ask given current Biden mental state. Especially government. anyone know dentists dental workers get vaccine? thought I’d bring light topic since it’s floating around everywhere here. got removed already anyways. thought happened couple weeks ago though, days. I’ll ask again. think things look like day 6 months? People long term care homes provided them. People long term care homes probably smart phone internet skills.

It’s idea “minimum viable product”: need get many, fast, can. Spinning large new database driven system last mile phone calls door knocking locate reach population definitely going fast effective. looked library. 
All found ripping new black metal. 
Thanks inadvertent tip! 
Maybe I’ll request book purchased library well. clearly never fly infestation. gotta hunt fuckers. Yup. there's reason assume keeps others safe unlike comments imply way bigger? depends mitigation efforts, like lockdowns mask usage. missed something. people get vaccine proven longer infectious people. There's certainty that. point time safe assume keep others safe, new technology

The vaccine impacts  Agreed, research base inferential statistics align statement must assume variant less deadly disease itself. never going reach goal, let's real here. different characteristics terms symptom types severity compared non variant? Nah, there’s brigade targeting sub. Nutmeg especially life, takes time using alt accounts downvote disagree anti-Science stance. 80% efficacy, question long? may worth trying pilot project, nothing else. Believe / don’t believe. “Belief” doesn’t separate fact fiction. posted separate comment emojis regarding Trump cronies lawless behaviors fall line think morally acceptable? You’re kidding think hasn’t widespread US months. haven’t looking it. good source read new strain? Avoiding clickbait tough days. know of. however helping biontech build second production site. highly doubt extra doses manufactured end going european nations first Feel better soon! Maybe. Maybe could isolated it. probably arrive Colorado UK. probably got Colorado New York California something. Now, Colorado, hell knows going.

We could taken measures might slowed spread. speakeasy barber shops California, least were. former stylist got shut long ago. Fauci also turned 79. isnt something would inquire think. charged topic best give days. is, really let time thing 1) 2 weeks;

2) rate, take almost decade get close everyone. that's far, far, far slow. vaccine using new technology vaccines can't assume results. Love smugness though. need google can. gave solution issue hand said look virulence trade hypothesis. It’s really intricate. like overall, enough re-up subscription 18 months (it’s lot cheaper longer term commitment). 

It depends use case though. want use track workouts, heart rate monitor fairly inaccurate high intensity exercise (DC Rainmaker really good review shortcomings). think it’s best sleep/recovery standpoint. 

I don’t know got special deal something time, THINK 30 day free trial. might used Joe Rogan code something that. would recommend starting possible since it’s pretty risk free. No, frontline health care workers 1a along residents long-term care facilities. old folks 1b along “essential workers”. “Essential workers” frontline health care workers, teachers, government workers, etc. Pretty much everyone (30-40M people) qualify “essential worker” old folks don’t get priority them. words, can’t stop mass deaths old folks vaccinate huge chunk entire population take months. Note apply Texas, Florida, states giving vaccine old folks first. statistics show it’s transmissible significantly so. That’s looking at. Sure, it’s preliminary it’s best evidence right now. majority anti-vaxx, going ban treatment, lol. Therefore hospitals remain overloaded indefinitely. Wrong. AstraZeneca one 62% effective. UK around 10% positive results.

UK approx half entire world's sequencing COVID far. Work home... Take care to, hope right reinfection rare common. Time tell. here. said one time need wear masks made upset ok! 😡 days feel long weeks seem fly get anywhere you’re near people. yes suppose obvious implication flu, need actually put extreme measures. Canada example north American continent far effectively addressed spread. death rate much lower US, largely lockdowns mask mandates. 

Look, even assume IFR flu agree hospitalization rate much higher. Therefore much larger drain resources flu, point affects every medical service. 

But reject claim IFR anywhere near flu. even 20-59 crowd. Almost 3000 healthcare professionals died US virus. That's many doctors, nurses EMT's whole population everyone 9-11. 70+ crowd would counted among them, retired age. assertion resolutely absurd. 

I disagreeing clear motivation assertions true yes would make sense lock economy. conservative guy myself, think many small businesses handcuffed big corporations took profits. look countries like Sweden far lax, find worse healthcare outcomes. Got mine today. Didn’t feel thing Awful understandable. Get best mask wear religiously avoid contact possible Good points.  Thank December deadliest month pandemic yet. someone lives Colorado, leaning toward statement. big spike cases October/November timeframe. Perhaps already US, might fell crack sequencing virua.  meant slow generally, least relative regulators globally - eg EU countries starting vaccination programs whereas UK going weeks masks cycling lockdowns norm now? Get real. Fantastic article; welcome respite clickbait headlines repeating information already know. Ed Yong *The Atlantic* continue provide stellar coverage pandemic. never going happen quickly.  didn’t declare necessarily true. made assumption. said virology suggest such. someone master human health epidemiology, would assume you’d understand shown statistics indicate case, assume follow normal trajectory. depends are. L.A. started sequencing days ago, specifically look UK variant. point, I’m pretty confident saying it’s almost certainly everywhere That's is. evidence atm. trials designed it. likely effect transmission. BS headline. alt account? say won’t mutate? Bill Gates full control shortly See believe good balance people nothing protect themselves. honestly think probably far damaging families alternative. people can't work year okay. F Perhaps debunk conspiracy theories around all. Officially, tell opportunity get one approved vaccines. 

Unofficially - study using saline placebo shot, side-effects, there's high chance got real vaccine. could also go antibody testing dime. Honestly, use duck duck go see articles aren’t google. use like Australian news, least know don’t want anything ccp. Start maybe? Good luck. Ahhh heard that. Catching months ago wouldn’t done anything feel. spreading inevitable sounds lot like I'm going point. 

Getting COVID worse lonely, lonely better risk losing control autoimmune disorder result quick downhill path quality life. sucks is. “possible” long term post COVID effects autoimmune issues deal fragile treatments fail. surreal see play out. 
 - new variant / strain found UK 
 - actually, first found back September 
 - new strain / variant 70% (ok, maybe 50% ish) transmissible  
 - quick everyone shut borders UK  
 - oh shit, first case found 
 
We know happens next. 
Maybe bit different things happened back March, already starting quite similarly. There's literally China Flu sub see Reddit shutting down. need peer reviewed studies combos things easily available OTC, but, nobody seems interested it, enough money probarly. informaion reviewed, easier NHC's go recommendations. contagious deadly... really cause panic? Ah well makes sense reason thought sold like, Hosptial merch something. got dad jammies came intensive care regular ward last year. carry essentials patients addition gifts. immune system detect faster since recognizes it? think that’s plan Ok. second largest state nation still vaccinated 20,000 people today. wild acceleration. may actually slowing down. I've started eating like crazy, mean worth try right? Depends live. Idk US A, though. People would full tripping. great. worry lot shit. Take win get one! Stay healthy friend Alls well ends well ROCK ! Weird backpedal damaging us savings exact purpose. Im also desperately searching remote work gotten everyone is. Spanish Flu Smallpox lockdowns shut entire world? Great write up. obvious procurement give little extra weight already promising early results. abandon others completely anything give slight extra purchase order urgency promising candidates.. Herd Immunity literally calculated based reproductive rate (R0 aka R naught aka contagious is). population size. higher reproductive rate, higher HI % needed reduction transmission sufficient enough lower spread manageable levels. going stop train going 100mph quickly stop train going 50mph. contagious virus likely find way non-immune parts population. Go read R value good animations YouTube etc explain this.

Its possible wont ever fully eradicate virus get risks populations less immune reduce transmission negligable levels.  can't fucking live lockdown crowds rest lives I'd rather burned alive. Early reports indicate newer variants damaging lethal potentially virus binds cells better higher chance infection. thought exercise pretend someone standing 10 feet away breathing. wild type virus might 10% chance virus finding way starting infection. mutated virus that's infectious might 17% chance infecting scenario. common. hospital sees frequently. sequenced states ridiculous, many cases point patients coworkers without immunocompromised systems. Reinfection common place evidence yet catch up. Call anecdotal, call whatever want help sleep night happening frequently. Evidence slow novel pandemic. Sorry rain anyone's parade reality care want. That's great I'm worried 501.v2 variant found South Africa fault, go off, guess. imagine ptsd levels among healthcare workers like pandemic. know right, absolutely is, was! like year really messed up. Deny? No. Move back line help actually responsible people? Absolutely. What's goal? Genocide? wonder America covid hotspot, stupid fuck flu vaccine sure stopped flu making rounds every year. that's fault believing him. Seriously never possible especially considering started vaccinating like 2/3 weeks ago even 100 million doses yet. We'll doses available next year hopefully ramp vaccinations. one listening orangutan says point. matter much there's vaccine though it? savings unemployment course! desperately search remote job. Note lack sequencing reason reinfections US can't confirmed. 

They confirmed sequencing show different strains rather remnants first infection.

As someone making point sequencing regarding reinfections, interesting many people finally paying attention lack ofnit. way actors gonna agree cover faces screen long. Rather mum dying, yes. ^ that’s you’re insane understanding gun control. probably get thoughts television. fire isn’t building yet. It’s building across street named “HUMAN” “WILD MINK POPULATIONS”. brought match new building. maybe there’s rooms building chemicals would make poisonous gas burned (metaphorical mutations unknown effects). fire keep moving side street hit “LYNX” “OWL” buildings, god forbid “RAT” building gives another possible bridge back “HUMANS” picked new mutations. 

What “WILD MINK POPULATIONS” building doesn’t sprinklers? whole building could go down. spreads buildings none fire prevention techniques? 

This bigger deal even understand consider. parking lots like outdoors testing now. *at* pharmacy, point aligning incentives letting private industry show America work efficiently. I'm increasingly convinced simply age. Age simple, easy prove functions more-than-adequate proxy Covid risk. must immediately ramp largest vaccination program ever done -- complexity enemy. Well mean that’s better nothing, existing strain already caused 334k deaths US, it’s like it’s slowing severity... Yikes- crude hot take that’s assuming healthcare facilities sending vaccine data DPH real time. Spoiler alert, aren’t. DPH dashboards dependent facilities reporting they’ve done.  187 hospitals Georgia. Hopefully least 500 vaccines. Ha yea first it’s like, f would hospitals gift shops? don’t want souvenir! it’s like, oh yea, people queen died Covid, would really bad. single parents work 60 hours week put food table pay rent. can’t even get government help, least teachers risk lives education.

I’ve hear lot stories teachers, really sad ones kids can’t homework get home make dinner younger siblings. kids middle school. gonna expose virus see actually works her? article literally quotes Fauci saying won’t hit goal  Read top stickied comment thread Pharmacist here.

Overtime extra staff, lol. wish.

CVS ask us somehow magically incorporate normal work flow, already dangerous is. Nope.

Im pointing French make vaccination mandatory think results high compliance.

If think wont need wont. Sesame Street! false Bill gates lol shit isn’t big one. Despite bustle, people don’t really suffer Covid. people don’t die it. 

The big one like Spanish Flu. quite. Christmas Eve Sunday numbers. less testing people test Christmas weekend. Reported deaths limited due reduced staffing autopsies. Cases deaths catch-up week next week, everybody back work. true spike, flatten.

It’s best use 7 day avg smooth dips weekend’s lower test processing autopsies. Plenty people probably covid included official figures due testing limitations simply deciding get tested. Especially first wave back March testing quite bad alot countries people get test back minor symptoms Honestly article's criticism even fair. know many Americans vaccinated paper work priority right now. However, know fact, nearly 16 million doses already allotted states. Perhaps 10 million doses already administered paperwork needs couple weeks process air right now. media obviously knows vaccination data back logged yet still pushing articles I'm wondering exactly want. We'll know many doses administered later ruthless rather mad interim data know fact accurate underreported. Actually believe 2018 France increased number mandatory vaccinations young children. Measles hep B list.

Previously 3 included first link. first link 95% ones mention 90%.

The previous years interesting given fact. old news? Meanwhile poor countries can’t get absolute correlation contagiousness lethality. Basically extremely lethal disease like ebola creates obvious symptoms kills hospitalizes host much time spread virus. necessarily mean virus shifts contagious less lethal. Many countries banned tourists allow entry Americans family members citizens residents. helped vaccinate hospital ATL today, gave 950 vaccines today. Would guess GA might able get close that....I hope 40 million. 10 million L.A. County alone.  wtf feel like around xmas first shots happened. agree done challenge trials, don’t think people paid participating, given free room board quarantine period, obviously world-class medical care get sick.

The reason shouldn’t paid would get lot desperate people signing up, there’s ethical argument anybody desperate truly volunteer. US states report cases thanksgiving Christmas either. European neighbours fully reported deaths example Christmas like UK example reporting covid deaths due holidays slight delay. anyway really make much difference report cases days? Aslong people bring tested still get results big deal. get tested without doctor's recommendation reputable labs US. Make appt online, pay, show get blood drawn. email results. deficient, make appointment doc talk supplementing.

My doctor feel testing warranted went route. patient someone lives rural town recent travel history. definitely likely widespread now.  state brought ""It's illegal government officials say write words 'Climate Change' comes holiday smash hit 'Too much testing increases numbers, little testing increases numbers. can't possibly number high.'"" first one cause pandemic became common cold. theory pandemic 1890 coronavirus, infulenza: Can't release location due medical privacy laws, shit minks subject HIPPA regulations?? Oregon gal here, looking escape nonsense state morphed soon Well yeah, agree. sure I'm downvoted. people saying virus would gone Easter warm weather summer. I'm currently trying wife want give son middle name Link, there's way goes it. I'm trying Lincoln instead full win good enough gift shop probably one dirtiest places hospital too. Perhaps mentioning vaccine made Mountain Dew factories might help too. susceptible propaganda idiot reasons deny medical care. Flu shots encouraged year reduce risk getting flu Covid time.

By way, really ten years, get tetanus booster. Tetanus nasty stuff. watch see happens. 
40% bonkers though, matter slice it. 
I hope colleague recently bought retirement home ok. believe employer breaking Covid-19 guidelines. takes phone call. WAIT! think get saying now..... funny election first week November solid majority time. plus side, might get rid bad neighbor. Hmmm seems something lost translation, I’ll us favor end back forth. 

P.S. two people family actually die so... 🤷‍♂️ read wrote. Especially word ""if"".  That’s real shit... gamma globulin years ago, hurt like mofo. Huge bubble skin (on top butt). Flu shots benign comparison! past seven days, China reported new locally transmitted cases clusters scattered across country Beijing Liaoning province north Sichuan southwest. Health officials Tuesday documented 15 new local infections Beijing Liaoning, half suburb Hangzhou east, security guard confirmed virus, Heihe, near China’s border Russia, flights canceled student grandmother tested positive. Tuesday, 23 neighborhoods districts authorities described “wartime” mode discovery new cases.

Definitely end world  dating pandemic?  Saying ""it still expected spread it"" bit overstatement. contrary, based experience past vaccinations knowledge immunology (as well NHP studies), quite likely vaccine least decrease transmission; I'll eat shoe case. data trials endpoint. would think it’s significant enough genetic change acknowledged year maybe. thing vaccine works fight new variant, really watch see. hoping one done though reason comment got deleted. response (to replied completely inappropriate manner) still posted below,

We’ve sacrificed lives year. plan almost half next year well. average human sacrifice lives sub 0.01 population. That’s percentage similar average risk took going outside COVID. again, managing expectations. Vaccine may still work modestly less effective. take away.

Also need new vaccines virus mutates further. 

Cold/Flu Covid season!  [He felt asked CBSN interview, later, watch site, pointed touched wrong shoulder. LOL. need assumptions order reason logically. Assumptions indispensable. Lies old ignorants heart misrepresentations. today packing Hill  Raw Story sense spurred irrationality arising elected officials.

My question this: Even though life precious, underpinnings strengths understandings medicine assaulted verbally, free speech insight damage society, masks, vaccine, making ascribe vehicles assault medicine society?  options, any? Awww, thanks! felt honored part process Know anyone vaccinated today, know 2 3  Best health care system world, everyone. Bravo. voted saying thing. know people think entire year screwing lacking cohesion, coordination, planning, somehow would different vaccine arrived.

If screwed everything along way, would screw vaccination well. bruh idea you’re downvoted. one smallpox since 1978. 2 million shots pace setting point executive fda stated likely unable meet goal rate Let manage yours.

Once determine someone willing sacrifice lives favor convenience, stop listening them. definitely think worth study. without study seems iffy me. Hmm knew convenience stores hospitals thing, gift shop sounded like place get stuff like tshirt says ""my dad spend 3 weeks hospital got lousy shirt."" let travel.  It'll respond faster detected, ""remembers"" virus.  speed detection all, though. bout state takes fucking responsibility thing said past 10 months  hope supply allocated healthcare workers don’t arbitrarily wait finish rather start next group time (I’d imagine plan)  Thanks. According 15.5% increase total cases last 2 weeks pediatric cases going faster. 2? future? use floppy discs

...wait, what? got vaccine today. didn’t feel thing either. Got first dose 2:30 Arizona time, issues far. It’s going really hard convince people continue. likely biggest challenge getting enough people take vaccine. 95% ease symptoms related covid. way trials run counted success patient partial symptoms instead symptoms. Ie sore throat fever cough cough sore throat. also fact 40% people asymptomatic first show signs anyways, counted towards success rate well even though know many control group. way presenting vaccine odd. even vaccine sense vaccines like partial code triggers certain response immune system. seems safe enough far harm foul guess. Let start saying I'm virologist all, understanding viruses want live. read lot early days pandemic 25 years ago March. Viruses want kill you. virus ""too deadly"" generally mutate weaker state order keep host alive thrive longer. got bad news. need find reservoir species, look closest mirror. 

We can't even eradicate polio. COVID stay, think. We're going add list standard vaccinations. Yes probably effective therapeutics eventually plus vaccine. 

The good thing vaccine targets spike protein virus don’t think would necessarily need yearly vaccine account yearly “strain”. Perhaps booster may needed spike protein pretty essential viral structure.

I imagine masks winter could become commonplace.  Saw last night, worth good laugh :) am, Dr. Walmart Shopper, proceeds cough sneeze explosively direction. Someone mentioned people get vaccine positive Covid tend worse side effects people never it. makes sense reaction shitty. reduces transmission lot hard justify wearing masks distancing point even.  didnt say part approval process.

You literally said: ""Normally medicines / vaccines go 10 year trials make sure lkng term side effects.""

This true. process sometimes take years, reason nothing long term side 10 year orocess allows long term effects become evident.

No, ten year *development* approval process. ten years trials. know long term effects vaccine taken months test released?

We're talking entirely new substances here. mRNA vaccines around decades first human trial took place 2009 many conducted since. Think like key - open different locks made materials - need test every new key get metal toxicity use it. legal protection pharma companies.

Of course do. medication 100% safe. chance adverse reaction. read side effects come Tylenol. 

There loads instances national governments take liability compensation claims vaccines. least unusual going Parasites earn evolution points killing hosts. Usually opposite, much easier use *live* host infect others dead host. 

[This article really gets interesting - Pathogens spread bodies dead hosts tend virulent. example give rabbit disease carried blowflies. trench mutation 1919 flu may another example - took advantage unsanitary conditions causing severe bleeding diarrhea.

 - Pathogens require live hosts tend evolve towards lower virulence. headline example HIV. slow moving virus, evolutionary changes also slow, become significantly less virulent decades.

 - Pathogens compete tend virulent may evolve really underhanded tricks enough genomic complexity. Malaria good example: complex human immune response it. 

 - virus attacks multiple populations may develop mutation helps important population random effect others. speculate West Nile virus may like this. spread effectively robins (valuable host) straight murders crows (probably accident; benefit virus).

 - Similarly, vaccine effective enough unvaccinated populations, pathogen's efforts evade immune system hit unvaccinated population really hard. example Marek's disease - contagious herpes plagues chickens related groundfowl. There's never particularly good vaccine, managed bounce back forth industrial farms unvaccinated wild organic flocks. virus much worse used be.

Of scenarios, HIV one promising seems agree observations. infection fatality rate Covid-19 seems fallen, hard compare data sure. 

The scary scenario like Marek's disease, reasonable questions whether vaccines ""sterilizing"" - (which means prevents reproduction *virus,* good thing.) [Clinical trials designed ask question strong immune response *has* demonstrated extremely promising there's good reason think vaccines give sterilizing immunity. 

Again, Marek's disease vaccines *really* crappy. Apparently industrial poultry industry willing invest vaccination. first found related viruses cause mild disease called ""good enough."" wasn't. They've ended breeding vaccine-resistant Marek's disease.

But level half-hearted biotech would like spreading coronavirus colds fight Covid. (Assuming, moment, would work. might, short run.) every single one vaccine candidates *much* sophisticated.

So fair criticize regulators pharma companies making sterilizing immunity priority. 

But reasonable despair Covid-19 expected become virulent. Even new British strain that's news? found way spread easily cause worse disease.  Nosense thought Florida liked blame California worse despite knowing data science works. Florida too. debbie downer, include increase transmissivity new strain UK recently detected Colorado? 

It long strain dominant one UK. Private pharmacies drive vaccinations parking lots would work well. Kaiser even flu year. able register, paperwork, vaccinate family 5 7 minutes  headcanon backstory haunted plushies Five Nights Freddys. Sure, want facts, some,

- vast majority vaccines effect reducing transmission.
- former FDA head expects vaccines reduce transmission.
- Moderna limited data showing vaccines could effect reducing transmission.

Calling everything dislike ""conspiracy theory"" poor argument. mom got vaccine today! felt *extremely* dizzy nauseous 30 minutes immediately getting it, fine symptoms whatsoever. need solve problem incentivizing movement urban areas. Bonus points putting dent republican attitudes forcing rednecks mingle people hate. Double bonus points reducing emissions. mean don’t see got many upvoted isn’t true. Im fan current regime literally testing European nation, we’ve implemented lockdowns, it’s people aren’t playing rules. We’re ahead game regards vaccination. You’re chatting shit. Thanks Mr. Wiseguy

^username ^checks ^out second doses three weeks later. Pfizer product ready ship. Plus states supplying local hospitals, know need reorder. mean know many people received shots. Thank responding. I’m risk also shut mostly want frontline essential workers get first. I’m Illinois think governor pritzker acquired Pfizer There's 150 cases one state (NSW) past couple weeks, 5 states pretty much virus free recorded locally acquired cases time.
The state far limited outbreak far resisted calls tight restrictions even mandated masks, we'll see pans looking touch go moment.
The states closed borders NSW, matter happens contained state. Sure take many months enough vaccine distribute everyone wants get take full effect. ever lived still ignoring it. parents spent Christmas brother Texas Mom went work today. fully prepared get call one neither easy time it.  outline: We’re testing anybody else pretty much. biomarkers. Directly decreasing anything. Well currently distributed 11 million 2 million doses given rate country back open 2047  see doom gloom. media supposed point things working smoothly, slower said would start. information. want journalists cheerlead government. Politicians good enough cheerleading. said, hiccups, media pointing out. Guess happens that? government feels pressure smooth hiccups. That's EXACTLY makes well-functioning society. worry, though, plenty people listened politicians call media enemy people fine uninformed misinformed politicians agendas.

Also, point article ALSO says Fauci thinks smoothed out. fear-mongering, then? evil media left part scare us? Soon force? mean soon force? 

Care rationed months now. many patients discharged home emergency departments would admitted similar labs, vitals, etc literally disease prior year. 

People oxygen saturation’s 80s sent home told call get worse. year ago patient oxygen saturation like meant doctor somewhere pooping pants.  obviously understand PCR works Lots people end line vaccinations young healthy work. also getting meaningful help government.

The fact vaccines still sitting warehouses bureaucrats fight get powerful getting vaccines ahead front line many situations plain criminal. Hahaha racism funny...

Go back fascist circle jerk That's great news! wife gets first shot Thursday. excited. supposed 10 days ago, turned away epipen prescription... Long story short, got sorted hospital admin got reschedule it. Yup clothes cut brought hospital. buy new ones leave. Yay gift shop. lots snacks magazines.  dataset Nov Dec, would argue even less ""informative"" already days January. dataset similar issues set first reply referencing, 106 CA cases sequenced across entire month, means enough give statistically significant information variants spreading. small dataset barely scratching surface many variants virus circulating, definitely able extrapolate variants dominant, emergent regressing. may caught know looking at. variant I've gathered, called B.1.1.7, handful mutations, protein. others scattered genome. may regarded error sequencing. likely, first find something new match, immediately jump conclusions. biology, many variables play, one might write first reading something new human error. happened rabbits? don’t understand example mom first exposed Saturday afternoon already infecting people Monday? common? said.

Maybe increase 22% age groups people still getting sick Nice see records number vaccinated! Keep going higher! I'm optimistic corona begin taper starting early next year. we're lucky vaccines antiviral medications safe highly effective halting spread, blocking transmission providing strongly long lasting immunity, Spring 2021, start turn tide favor, driving numbers summer, achieving herd immunity Autumn 2021, dispose masks, abolish social distancing take plastic barriers. Maybe super spreader new In-N-Out? Safeway. CPhTs going trained vaccinate starting next month Oregon. clothes made wool?  Typically won’t choice. equally effective. Moderna seems common side effects think may provide longer lasting protection. much different. Yeah old people supposed get generally people never used state government public health software, shows. beat COVID-19 know pharmacist mentioned volunteered training spot. probably consider LA part ""real"" US. Yes, increased around 60/day accorsing prediction. Maybe 80 pessimistic. Still far 205 claimed.

Of course reported number higher longer wait reports. rocket science. Maybe we'd less shitty Cuba... think Nashville native would Christmas blasted memory year. think person resigned fact.  Seems like two million vaccinations far bad vaccines restricted healthcare workers first responders. 

Obviously wait month groups vaccinated helping. Depending city state, 70-75 age group even first responders still another week two getting access vaccinations. already eastern Asian countries. wish we'd learned years ago. know...I wish would learned like 7th grade science class. Walking business pre-January 2020 mask would triggered alarms. would wearing masks years factor. I'm glad they're finally normalized, even forced. glad getting better first discovered September. Worth noting things:

* U.S. data estimated.
* DTP &amp; Measles vaccines *childhood* vaccinations, may accurately reflect broader attitudes towards vaccines general acceptance/uptake vaccines adults.
* looks like looked DTP vaccine statistics, France slightly exceeds U.S. look others, result quite different. example, [Flu vaccine U.S. far exceeds France (51% vs 69%). U.S. also exceeds France slightly Measles vaccines (92% vs. 90%). lol

You know difference fact opinion you? Yeah people killing criticism, *no idea* kind effort goes max vaccination effort. We’re best resources staff have. I’m sick people telling us it’s enough.

We (public health) muddled way entire pandemic basically blind, tasked vaccine distribution *on top of* covid testing, contact tracing, normal duties. sure, keep telling us much suck. I've one cold last 20 years, hardly means I'll protected getting COVID, always wear masks whereever go Canada, likely US too. globally well. There’s 99.9% chance vaccine protects variant covid. many others come. “But could easily give us COVID-20.”

That scared sh*t me. Actually, EMA criticized UK rushing approve Phizer  Yup, get downvoted bunch bots ppl living lifes fear based mindset really contagious cause deaths even directly deadly causing infections :( Take numbers extra grain salt reported holiday. many people vacation, testing capacity reporting may usually is.

More in-depth statistics past week released tomorrow (Wednesday), also possible see number tests positivity rate differ.

The applies reported deaths, probably extra lag right holidays. cure would increase hours reduce tests! Someone let scientists know.  Oh ok, thanks. understand get wild would need vaccine every year can't eradicate able determine mechanism makes contagious? worry transmissible surface transmission, would make issue masks complicated. One reasons experts recommend masks beginning COVID similarly transmissible flu surface transmission, masks would effective people would catching touching faces. Also, people neglecting hand surface hygiene currently transmission air major pathway. might hard get people start taking sanitation seriously again. Yeah, would small group talk negative reactions. Thankfully type reaction, autoimmune flair rare occasion. stupid party decided go cost lot lives. credibility hit took one California could afford. Yes, going bad anyways. hypocrisy made worse. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically.

Severe illnesses can't sustain chain infection peter out. Social distancing... LA county started testing variant discovered UK, know exactly. Hope figure new variant known one causing increase spread.

every state US federal gov testing keep eye domestic mutation well outside introductions could cause problems whether severity illness increase transmission. playing catch up, actively discouraging masks throwing maskless holiday parties etc, continues cost lives people's long term health. [There's mutation originating UK Best case scenario, this, chances sound grim quite literally evolving. I'm second night 5 ED. positive cases walk since started yesterday. shit show.

But people (see below) still acting cute like acts entirely differently known viruses. Yes, true. spokesperson, dictator.

The Public Health Agency gathers data uses come new recommendations advice government. government ultimately decides action, may also pass parliament.

The whole process bureaucratic many people involved decision chain. Tegnell may state epidemiologist, many people involved decision making new recommendations even reach government. backpedal? pointed actual numbers much higher reported numbers (which already quite high).

Do even know backpedal means? heard news person say Biden plans use Whatever Defense Act bump production vaccines get lot public ASAP.

As sidebar, Biden even golf? He's gonna need vacation busting ass within first 30 days. virus goes away people. either die virus defeat it. twisted way, *optimists* right. good pace...we need much better factor least 5x. preferably more. least found cure. well population 10 million higher texas didn’t make link. *sighs*  It’s hard blame people. livelihood, aren’t given compensation/ incentive can’t imagine many people people deciding kill read article, advocates even want murderers let out, would certainly thrill victim's families

Yes. end well lots them. think we'll ever get rid masks. shouldn't. part culture already -- flu cold rates way them. keep anytime feel little sick need go public. can’t true. dude told everyone vaccines would GPS trackers said they’re lying cases 🙄 Yeah, sounds right! Flu different every year..covid still don’t know, I’m guessing becomes endemic ... think could still around, weaker right? belive read coronaviruses usually get weaker mutate. Eggs used Pfizer Moderna vaccines. 

Here’s why. Traditional vaccines use attenuated virus cultivated using eggs growth source virus. Pfizer Moderna vaccines mRNA vaccines. virus vaccine, segment protein inside virus. Ok. But, exercise gym home. livid scumbags refuse wear masks social distance. really unfair elderly compromised people must go buy food staff hospitals well essential workers. Today (I live Texas) ran H‑E‑B grocery store tons Karen’s (male &amp; female) almost 20-50s walking around masks u see chip shoulder. really want tell “hey u realize hospitals state wide saturation?” Like, don’t even understand u get car crash something u goi get poor delayed care. post yesterday Texas literally three ED docs chimed one comment (all different areas state) said it’s cluster f* facilities regions. One guy said patient status epilepticus 24 hours Hemoglobin 4 sitting ED...they hadn’t done anything weren’t monitored. nasty hateful people won’t wear masks social distance truly think blood hands. Thank work nurse safe please. Yay here! America, best. Spread dat virus around!!! youtuber dutchsinse says signs pointing imminent quake. lots recent swarms. feel you, three reasons hope.

* Like said above, vaccines plus infected mean spread slows down
* enable us find sort compromise: ways socialize, go outside, stay safe, rules laid reduce potential risk
* Innovation!! finally seeing fruits inventors. Honda released new form car ventilator great results. beginning. technology enable us stay indoors others, go cars buses trains, slowly create new normal better staying home time.

That said, kudos right thing. too, family given end grief it, right thing will, assure you, better. give 3 months Christmas infections rise fall, combination vaccines, new technology, warmer weather start see change. wondered Sweating Sickness Tudor England. maybe solved one, know. even know viral bacterial, last read killed large number people, abruptly disappeared. suppose could coronavirus? way test whether vaccine confers sterilizing immunity. takes much larger/longer trial. really want tell everyone wait (say, 5) years vaccine might released?

A less-effective vaccine stop pandemic. Then, plenty time develop better/perfect vaccines. Georgia done least 52,000 total yesterday, according dashboard. guy’s math wrong. 260MM eligible people divided 212 days (that’s number days Jan-July) 1.2MM per day.

Once move focusing medical professionals LTC professionals, onto general population, we’ll hit easy. Keep mind 260MM people want vaccinated either. zero emergency fund beginning year. Zero. even lost part salary expected quarterly bonus months year. also surgery pay bit bills there. 

I thankful us kept jobs relatively cheap people (live cheap place, drive old paid cars). That’s way able save emergency fund. stimulus check earlier year also helped. going trust would extra support happen lose job, made priority save up. Houston, PROBLEM know excuse hate Chinese people. get like damn dude someone tells actively possibly save lives quarantining i’m gonna know Mexico la neta ni puta idea de cuan grave esta la cosa pq valemos machin verga said wanted “underscore importance increasing genomic sequencing capacity worldwide” sharing information U.N. health agency countries looking testing effectively able pick variants adjust strategies cope,” said. homeless probably lot living street. recommend reading article. sorts common misconceptions takes neutral standpoint. 

It long either, take lot time. Hey, fuck off? Anyone caught breaking rules even suspected virus gets shot

???yeah seems like propaganda bud supposed go Florida, that's probably going happen. That's last place want right COVID. Oh well. Ahhh don’t put universe! got enough issues Everyone's vaccinations politicians celebrities telling us good easy vaccine is. We're 5 years old prepping kindergarten. Dang. basically spent whole life taking care body get dibs vaccine people that...did better.

I get it, matter look obese increases risk severe COVID symptoms matter nobody deserves die. weird thing guess. google cache even slightly pedantic exactly guy said? responded ""I wonder lessened symptoms"" LITERALLY COMPARING SYMPTOMS PEOPLE ER SEVERE SYMPTOMS.  Hey person economic privilege. You’re amazing job. applaud sacrifices.  we’re fucking not. people get it? Yes. doesn’t impact current course action. ?? get paid kind money 0 paid leave? Man, problem US.  work film production LA protocols strict. Testing 2-5 times per week depending position, always 6 ft distance except cast, designated zones, 95 masks day except lunch us take cars, face shields/goggles working indoors. Literally 50+ page document protocols one strike rule. break protocol, you’re fired. That’s it. Oh yeah dude? ended pandemic? reduce cases outside country 0? putting risk getting vaccinated? seen couple weeks, I'm taking seriously is. I'm one skipped Thanksgiving Christmas family. I'm one insisted us wearing masks came surge.   
Sounds like saying everyone gets vaccinated stay away unvaccinated. work? Generally vaccines take much much longer test make (think _years_ longer).

But, considering situation, _a lot_ money manpower thrown order produce good vaccine much shorter time. One year absolutely incredible feat. course, experience due Sars_Cov1, fact vaccine made short amount time caused concerns many people. hospitals become completely overwhelmed. Yeah multiple years. Nope. Hospital staff, too, makes worse IMO. Nurse came work day, bragging refusing vaccine enough time test ""safety"" something worse flu.  mostly correct calling J&amp;J failure pretty premature. Slower expected, yes, still likely coming quite soon (if safe effective). Spanish flu 100 years ago even worse. get that. I’m talking keeping well everyone chance get it.  hope fighting good fight end restriction god-given right nude public go restaurants without shirt shoes. big change. One thousand Americans died COVID-19. normal nearly people would died year people could shut wear single extra piece fabric they're around others. take much stop spread COVID-19, ridiculous amount ICUs turn people away die home they've run room, people COVID, regular everyday emergencies. something happens year.

You countless laws follow every day without complaint. People can't drive drunk harm brings others. allowed spread virus stopped something simple??? I'm sure lot concerned high risk demographic. know what? Chances are, high risk demographic overweight obesity rates US. Also, diagnosed comorbidities, mean undiagnosed.

Have empathy lost lives, loved ones, especially outside death statistics yet recover, months later. God asks us care neighbors. Right looks like wearing mask getting vaccinated can. Even government got many mask made, they’d need huge final mile logistics effort deliver them. UPS FedEx struggling volume Christmas packages imagine deliver mask every home business US, would require someone stop every house, you’d need like 400 500k people it, top equipment, vehicles, infrastructure required. could use USPS. Oh trust me, second I'm eligible vaccine, I'm taking it.

I want unethical pitch essential, Frontline worker I'm not. That’s norm vaccines right? Heartbreaking. 41 year old, scary. Republican Louisiana Many people understand nuance.

Lord knows never disagree one, like try :) Oh man...this good... getting downvoted experience 4k deaths per day soon. [Especially random, fully understand affects bodies yet.  negative rapid treated true negative probably one many massive contributing factors blew stupidly.

[Oh wow, look let's say community 1 infectious person per 40 non-infectious, [plausible figure Pretty scary odds.

So break nasopharangeal swab test kits (the kind goes waaaaaaay nose-hole). FDA says negative likelihood ratio 0.37. swab everyone let people ""clean"" in.

Well, 40 / 0.37... clean population 1 infectious person per 108 non-infectious. Next, put 200 set let mingle party. odds nobody infectious?

5 perfectly safe gatherings vs 17 least one person infectious. far better testing (7:993, ""nice super-spread party""), *seriously* false sense security. 

The likelihood ratios *absolutely* publicized explained. Something like distributed patients employers.

 negative result means test detect chemical signs Covid-19. perfectly rule possibility disease.

 Podunk Bureau Health estimates ratio 200 healthy persons area every 1 person currently infectious. negative result improves confidence 500:1, **it possible one person spread Covid despite negative test.**

 **Do rely negative test results alone combat spread Covid-19.** Testing provides 2.5x factor protection, combined measures, including...

Oh 2.5x factor *absolutely miserable* compared to, say, contraceptives. odds ratio avoiding pregnancy 270x perfect condom use 32x typical condom use, vs complete naiveté. average person *no idea* ""but everyone Covid-negative"" least order magnitude less protection ""but use condoms."" *Choina.* Seriously. work retail busy pre-pandemic. 

There’s stay home order? stay home order? Genetics + overweight. much. wondering sweden went againt every european country That’s rotten. Rest Peace also currently give flu vaccines half-ish entire population every flu season. 

I'm definitely worried handoff administrations costing us weeks time. would pretty par course current administration's sour grapes cause withhold key info incoming administration last possible minute. 

I think everybody universally aches every day post-covid freedom inexcusable. awful. two young kids. tested positive December 18. virus moves fast young guarantee recovery. careful everyone. government failed us needed most. 
 
Maybe electing failed reality star toughest job planet good idea. ""Climate lockdowns already discussed""? exactly? Certainly one w/ consequential opinions. Many people understand nuance. given inch, take mile, get family sick get angry... People told preserve masks health-care professionals, interpreted masks work. Sometimes need provide overbearing message people understand. researchers say findings, published December 16, 2020, *JAMA Psychiatry...*

Why virus seem random effect? Yeah. math get post marked good news. positive development. virulence x higher transmission good.

So suppose that's suprising although I'd imagine spike cases post holidays till warmer weather remain fear virus. hit March though, year this, weather warming 70s vaccinated makes high percentage deaths, people it. realize millions Americans uninsured, far Universal thing. reading 1947 NYC vaccinated 6 million people smallpox one month. done. matter political will, supplies logistics. probably correct. point, don’t think care anymore Much COVID transmission pre-symptonatic anyway, biggest limiter spread seems infection mild people contagious. mutation slightly increasing virulence could absolutely spread faster - likely, even.

Even it’s 0.0001% rate, that’s big enough risk I’m continuing stay home wear mask go out, get shot. test provide results 2 3 days still take week iirc Mr Hancock implied UK could vaccinate two million people week, beginning January 4, said country could deliver jab ""at pace AstraZeneca manufacture"".

Earlier Wednesday, firm said would produce two million doses week.

Thought made risk Throwing around 'political' derogatory term context add anything conversation. They're politically pressured save lives. gestation period 2 14 days. could infected days shot. Articles like ripe misinformation. get Covid-19 anywhere, workplace seems likely can't exclude things may doing. Per day? Yeah, doubt that's feasible. Jab up! Man.. think upper middle class people know people getting vaccines some.. great? News you

There LOT lower middle class people working jobs turn know people. like im sure couple people floating around might know someone less Upper middle class That’s true - starts working 10-12days first shot!

The efficacy higher one week second shot (52% vs 95%), it’s likely protected severe way around people lmao Reddit doesn’t like say that.

It goes religious commitment ‘both sides suck, bro.’ give blood whenever it’s convenient always annoyed told wait after. passed blood draw. literally able ask guy happens pass felt coming. I’ve felt feeling twice life, things start get blurry confusing. It’s 8 days since family out. want take Covid test hang out. 8 days potential exposure long enough register accurate test somehow (no one symptoms). 

Or need wait longer? UK's new decision sit doses favour giving people one dose instead waiting give people second dose lot quicker expected...if everything works UK might first country see effect vaccines literally raced vaccine record times recently started distributing use. Quit doomer. vaccines administered trials decade. named plenty. already explained silly say “No mRNA vaccine made commercially available unless mRNA vaccine already commercially available.

The Pfizer vaccine *is* first commercially available mRNA vaccine. never said otherwise. said mRNA vaccines studied detail decades administered humans trials decade.

You’re making sense. able get unjection /S mention facility literally covid testing daily since they’re Hospital haven’t gotten vaccine either. government failed us roll out. mean I've flights since covid make test never expected would. way know railways buses even shops restaurants cinemas make test. Indeed. Hockey really troubling history cardiac incidents (Cherepanov, Fischer, Zoltok, Peverley, Bouwmeester, John McCarthy retired AHL last year ischemic stroke) many professional sports. Since sport already appears put players higher risk cardiac event since myocarditis contributed Cherepanov's death, seems like really good idea.

On hand, [this found many retired NFL players show signs cardiac abnormalities long careers over. Maybe NHL alone this, maybe leagues diligent screening heart conditions even pandemic subsides. think clear politics play, AZ (UK/Swedish) - **Oxford University** clearly UK-backed enterprise.

Pfizer Moderna US companies.

Now guess country fast-tracked pre-bought what. state, it’s completely county. recommendations state classifies 1a, 1b, 2, etc. 

As healthcare worker, able get first dose. know people field counties state still don’t know they’ll 1a group 2 group. here. remember wearing face mask February first confirmed case close city everyone looked crazy. hope pull through. Sorry dealing that. hear you. felt way got Covid doctor's visit nurse likely idea it. 

They're saying 50% people Covid idea it, never show symptoms, even fever. good people would horrified know they're spreading it, like nurse job. Now, sure, may gotten asshole maskless rally, still, gave different perspective. 

Now I'm mad fucking government gave us ability stay home without starving losing homes healthcare. Outpatient healthcare worker here. contact. say MAY. happens lot. don’t proper PPE since aren’t hospital. spend 45 minutes less 2 feet patient wear paper thin masks; exposed noses Chins. Sorry risk. Every single day. name 1 medicine vaccine made publicly available long term results for? Yeah, moved EMA London Amsterdam lost tonne staff moved UK's MHRA, even MHRA lot legwork EMA. Even disingenuous statement made sometime campaign, referred posted blurb, almost 2 months ago latest. course lot things could've changed even 100M possible said it.

Crappy article tbh. metaphor meant compare nukes vaccines, illustrate point things get developed faster dire necessity fill. One big thing people keep forgetting free markets works options. Monopoly cartel laws, environmental worker protections, social safety net. keep options open free market actually work. , Step 1: complain public sector bloated inefficient
Step 2: cut budget point dysfunctional
Step 3: public sector useless therefore must privatized
Step 4: profit!
Step 5: watch global pandemic sweep helpless country. Wipe away tears dollar bills. Keep telling self that. report today says rate giving vaccine take 10 years.!0 years till Americans vaccinated. means we're probably hit huge wave sick dying children, top everything else. entire subreddit fear porn honestly shut let scientific fact-based subs stay. No. It’s effective getting second shot Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

K. Trump administration rush FDA approve vaccine like day earlier? Whats point approving freaking day earlier ready distribute vaccine? tested positive. male nurse. tell employer took Kangarooville, QLD least, thats actually treated similar level grevious bodily harm. memory carries possible 14 year jail sentence. 5 100 much pandemic black white. nuances things. Including masks. 

Masks probably protects wearer degree sure people around certain degree. worn. silver bullet make virus miraculously disappear everyone them. Unless combined serious social distancing personal hygiene. 

If aren’t open details politicised views, aren’t helping much. Wdym? Vaccines way absolutely correct, vaccine game changer especially developing countries. places like Germany Spain struggling distribution/storage developing countries stand chance vaccines. 2021 let rip. getting rid time soon. ""secret"" maybe overstating it. website: difference defensive planning offensive weapons development giving orders said done, research itself. actually read sources. course pick smallpox outlier correct virus considered ""eradicated,"" one among numerous others CDC consider eradicated. 

HIV comes mind. vaccine 95% effective takes 2 weeks build immunity, article makes sense given context. Christian Ramers, infectious disease specialist Family Health Centers San Diego, told ABC News affiliate scenario unexpected.  it’s result people anxiety around needles? Needles don’t bother all, like don’t think heart rate changes slightest. mean I’ll never pass shot? worst I’ve ever sore arm maybe teeny bit weather day. get point, forum great. point make terrible predictions wrong every step way pandemic. There's nothing stopping journalists going camera getting waivers signed.

Did read description top thread? part makes think anyone involved would interested journalist all, say nothing signing waivers?

Yea, would good country, people thick shit doing. happened month ago changed it? Untrue. 

I doctor associated major hospital system (private practice). 

I called around day Monday told phase 2, despite specifically listed phase 1a literally every othe government entity. Florida Department Epidemiology, way. get continue risk life lomger necessary. unpublished data suggests leaving longer gap first second doses increases overall effectiveness jab.**

This key bit hopefully they'll enough data know exactly within next month so. [this thread good answer worries birth defects specifically: believe still recommending pregnant women take now, participants pfizer trial get pregnant, datapoints exist soon enough “No mRNA vaccine made commercially available unless mRNA vaccine already commercially available.”

I never said that. making things up. 

that point. 

I said beginning, many messagea ago ""publicly available medications"" 50% good enough FDA - especially 90% severe again:

In context fine wording Probably they're confident current data satisfy EMA. Well point trying make could distribute vaccine everyone self-administered easy anyone it... show exactly case showing would completely fucked dose. 

You literally even finish making point proving wrong. Talk ""own goal."" seems huge scepticism directed US media US posters here. think quite bit bias reluctance admit important efficacy even 60%.  Moderna makes little easier still fool proof. 10 doses defrosted 10 people scheduled 3 show up. (Yes legit happens Healthcare workers incredibly rude us) point scramble call around make sure doses wasted. Yesterday waited 3 hours waste doses. sad.

I fear vaccination effort ongoing, become apparent bad also affect relatively young people. Somebody 41 know previous illnesses would wait long time get vaccine. 

And yes, maybe ethical vaccinate parents young children somewhat earlier. Nobody substitute father mother young child. new mutation, may leave many orphans. wrong. defend that? 

What mean defend? think dumb wrong. points wrong, later right, wrong authority, place authorities share data health data wrong. such, requires good faith members. information given China shit makes epidemic worse, that's China. US decides share information anymore make epidemic worse, that's US. authority. Also listen dumb predictions since obviously spout without knowledge beyond anyone else has?

Do realize ""anyone else"" information thanks WHO? Because, I've repeated four times since first comment health authority, forum health authorities share data. guess missing point (clue, I've repeated four times) think I'm saying always right. appointed vaccines coordinator yesterday many problems US think would call failed state. may make analogy. 

If batting 0.13 baseball team paying $40 million dollar superstar salary, going surely called it. honestly should. UK planning increase time doses Oxford/AZ vaccine 3 weeks 3 months, order get first dose vulnerable people quickly possible. anyone know countries (or states provinces) planning go approach? could swear people US debating this.

Source: sounds like UK made decision based talking experts efficacy approach, people trial get booster 3 week interval. article get posted? taken Good idea edit said clearly correct. 
Also don’t really opportunity wait conclusive evidence we? something lot people seem miss. wanting see friends normal.

I want see friends, we're middle global fucking pandemic. logical course action hunker year two socialize online we're vaccinated. That's common sense. 2 weeks ago didn’t need There's concept emergency authorisation Australia

Why create one idk 🤷 least jumping windows yet like Russian doctors. JVCI said would publish full report 'shortly'. Suspect gov.uk site later today. fucks everyone up... almost think run day don’t pay 2k pass.... disgusting many people care even gleeful see Chinese people dying.

January mega threads bonkers. 

I particularly interested worried parents Vietnamese visited Vietnam February. That's took rather serious beginning.

Too bad many others didn't. Makes sense. number deaths gives ifr 1.17% line expectations. Rural Colorado travel history, jeez. really trying sound anti vax this, truly honest question. vaccines made record time really idea sort long term affects taking it? remember hearing something happened earlier history vaccines causing birth defects. think Thalidomide was. I'll edit post above. think ""strong suspicion"" individual effect based metastudies lab studies. mean conclusive evidence. TBH might better get everyone 1 dose first go seconds since it’s 80% effective first one.

Get whole population 80 trying squeeze final 15. I’m anti vax I’m jumping get vaccination. around less year possible know long term side affects? Even know components relatively safe, know interact together? I’d rather wait year two make sure adverse affects hard reconstitute. instructions immediate use, thaw undiluted vials room temperature [up 25oC (77oF)] 30 minutes. Thawed vials handled room light conditions. Vials must reach room temperature dilution. Undiluted vials may stored room temperature 2 dilution invert vaccine vial gently 10 times. vial contents using 1.8 mL 0.9% Sodium invert vial containing Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 10 times mix. 2°C 25°C (35°F 77°F). Discard unused vaccine 6 hours 0.3 mL Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine preferentially using low dead-volume syringe and/or needle. Administer make pancakes reconstitute Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Fucking absurd.... enough vaccines start tier 2 end January. again, like testing, federal government fucks up. state huge central delivery location national guard set move vaccines throughout state. they're showing despite Pfizer saying millions doses sitting waiting. Yeah, friend liked dirt bikes crashed pretty bad similar head injury. would ask questions forgot asked 3 minutes ago. remember anything past month 2. tell accident 400 times. LOL Translation interview:

Beijing News: police admonish you?


Li Wenliang: December 30, 2019, made statement university class group ""Seven cases SARS confirmed Wuhan South China Fruit Seafood Market"". that, police classified said rumor, admonished.


Beijing News: police admonish you?

Li Wenliang: admonished January 3, 2020 went home day. police detain, warn, fine them. don’t know 7 people admonished, don’t know occupations in.


Beijing News: original intention spreading news?


Li Wenliang: doctor Department Ophthalmology Wuhan Central Hospital. time, seven people South China Fruit Seafood Market went hospital treatment later quarantined. Initially, test results 7 people showed infected SARS coronavirus. sent messages group remind everyone relatives take precautions. also instructed everyone group spread news test report outside. expect (the news) spread soon.


Beijing News: agree qualitative nature rumors?


Li Wenliang: think spread rumors, reminding everyone take precautions. virus test report published classmate group sent colleague hospital. report showed test performed Shenzhen Huada Gene Technology Co., Ltd. number 7 people infected also told colleague. One hour sending message, gave explanation class group. said 7 people isolated hospital confirmed infected coronavirus, virus type still identified. everyone paid attention matter back then, might outbreak today.

[Li Wenliang's picture admonishment want continue work front line recovering suspected new coronary pneumonia

Beijing News: infected?

Li Wenliang: January 8th, received 82-year-old female ophthalmologist. suffered acute angle-closure glaucoma, fever symptoms. result, patient developed fever next day. CT results showed symptoms ""ground glass lesions lungs"", viral pneumonia. Later, female patient ruled common viral infections, mycoplasma chlamydia infections, time hospital test kit confirmed patient, diagnosed time. time, many people care, hospital take special protective measures, careless contact patients. Later, hospitalized January 12 fever cough. suspected case new coronary pneumonia.


Beijing News: situation now?


Li Wenliang: receiving isolation treatment Respiratory Critical Care Unit Wuhan Central Hospital. Difficulty breathing, oxygen tube plugged in, unable get up, talk, occasionally look phone, type communicate others. worried first, doctor would comfort daily rounds. longer feverish, mental state better previous days. believe hospital doctors definitely help recover.

Beijing News: live period isolation?

Li Wenliang: sleep 5 6 hours every night, squint day. Every day, hospital canteen deliver meals, including rice, fried vegetables, meat, etc., eating, drinking, urinating bed. addition, watch video family every day chat text.

The Beijing News: Internet, people said physician qualification certificate revoked.

Li Wenliang: Fake, physician qualification certificate revoked.

Beijing News: family?


Li Wenliang: me, parents also developed fever symptoms. CT lungs showed ground-glass lesions. receiving treatment hospitals Wuhan, fine major problem. People whose parents 60s 70s understand (conditions), say discharged two negative nucleic acid results. wife ophthalmologist hospitals, child 5 years old. wife lives children mother-in-law's home.

Beijing News: impact incident brought family life?

Li Wenliang: admonished special impact me. Thank everyone concern support. relaxes lot.

Beijing News: recovery, want do?

Li Wenliang: recovering, want return front line soon possible continue see patients. CPR kinda useless anyways honest. It’s since school numbers may bit off, essentially you’ve 4 minutes without defibrillation 10 minutes without change regardless you’ve defibrillated not, chances surviving neurologically intact (ie. brain dead) like 2% less. efficacy Indian trial use consistent dosing spacing vaccine dose 1 2? Thats i've heard, variant hits hard it'll bad, theres endgame now. places 15 minute waiting period post-vaccination watch side effects? seems like large hurdle places like CVS/Walgreens. 

Don't already? Every year get flu vaccine local Walgreens (formerly Rite Aid), pharmacists says ""hang around store minutes vaccine"". possibly even mentioned papers make sign, I'm sure I've ever read carefully. Except still is. 

**They actually \~1% cases**, indeed SEVERAL ORDERS magnitude complete shit eating moron. 

No wonder country falling shit. many many people like beyond brainless. Yeah hourly deluge COVID news convince people, another article Tiktok video make difference. Journalists grasping straws write anything days. also realize thing vaccines got flu shot year. Literally every vaccine I've ever gotten, allowed leave immediately without waiting, wait 10 min flu shot. Although flu shot drive thru vaccination, logistics actually pretty good. Signed 15 min window, everything happened tables outdoors parking lots indoor parking structures, given different parking lot wait 10 min. Perhaps celebrities cosplay know-it-all sanctimonious expert medicine done actual research rather talking asses, people would apt take pandemic seriously.

He's shitter spreading dangerous disinformation, deserves scorn possible. don’t care you’re buying 😂😂 Passing vaccinations quite common. dangerous bad. Government ended lock-down 3 weeks Christmas, even contact tracing able trace cases sufficient quality speed. populist move based badly designed ""anti-epidemic system"" designed epidemiologists later even modified populist government end lock-down least 1 week sooner.

All backfired quickly, back lock-down, positivity rate 48.54% hospitals filling patients again. 5712 people hospitals, 176,900 US-equivalent.  actually appaling. Israel vaccinated 152,000 yesterday, US 40 times population expecting government efficient something, I've got oceanfront property Arizona sell you. insane Israel much better anyone else. Anecdotally, one Covid testing centers locally (Alabama) three hour wait yesterday yeah, they're catching holiday lag dealing probably contracted xmas. last week, know people personally tested positive entire pandemic. feels like matter time point, even us dumbasses follow science. We're outnumbered here, people charge can't/won't coordinate vaccine distribution fast enough help us out. ""Once approved"" means months today tens thousands dead elderly vulnerable. Yes are. double-checked Kayak.com posting confirm daily non-stop LHR DEN. dont know CVS hold Pfizer vaccine, happening. bad people cant bothered wear mask long. I’d whelmed posthumous catapult launch protest. 

If lucky enough posthumous trebuchet launch protest however, legacy.

Li Wenliang: think spread rumors, reminding everyone take precautions. virus test report published classmate group sent colleague hospital. report showed test performed Shenzhen Huada Gene Technology Co., Ltd. number 7 people infected also told colleague. One hour sending message, gave explanation class group. said 7 people isolated hospital confirmed infected coronavirus, virus type still identified. everyone paid attention matter back then, might outbreak today.

[Li Wenliang's picture admonishment want continue work front line recovering suspected new coronary pneumonia

Beijing News: infected?

Li Wenliang: January 8th, received 82-year-old female ophthalmologist. suffered acute angle-closure glaucoma, fever symptoms. result, patient developed fever next day. CT results showed symptoms ""ground glass lesions lungs"", viral pneumonia. Later, female patient ruled common viral infections, mycoplasma chlamydia infections, time hospital test kit confirmed patient, diagnosed time. time, many people care, hospital take special protective measures, careless contact patients. Later, hospitalized January 12 fever cough. suspected case new coronary pneumonia.


Beijing News: situation now?


Li Wenliang: receiving isolation treatment Respiratory Critical Care Unit Wuhan Central Hospital. Difficulty breathing, oxygen tube plugged in, unable get up, talk, occasionally look phone, type communicate others. worried first, doctor would comfort daily rounds. longer feverish, mental state better previous days. believe hospital doctors definitely help recover.

Beijing News: live period isolation?

Li Wenliang: sleep 5 6 hours every night, squint day. Every day, hospital canteen deliver meals, including rice, fried vegetables, meat, etc., eating, drinking, urinating bed. addition, watch video family every day chat text.

The Beijing News: Internet, people said physician qualification certificate revoked.

Li Wenliang: Fake, physician qualification certificate revoked.

Beijing News: family?


Li Wenliang: me, parents also developed fever symptoms. CT lungs showed ground-glass lesions. receiving treatment hospitals Wuhan, fine major problem. People whose parents 60s 70s understand (conditions), say discharged two negative nucleic acid results. wife ophthalmologist hospitals, child 5 years old. wife lives children mother-in-law's home.

Beijing News: impact incident brought family life?

Li Wenliang: admonished special impact me. Thank everyone concern support. relaxes lot.

Beijing News: recovery, want do?

Li Wenliang: recovering, want return front line soon possible continue see patients. forget, sabotaged corrupt administration effort support votes knew them. According Space Force guidelines, vaccinations running impulse power. order reach warp speed need invoke Defense Production Act produce dilithium crystals, get Chewbacca R2D2 fix hyperdrive get 1 million vaccinations day. Space Force Guardians Groot working around clock get vaccinations high risk patients like Marco Rubio.

Would like know more? clue people freaking vaccine rollout.

First off, it’s incredible even got two vaccines approved 2021.

Second, CDC counter way behind. states fine distributing vaccine, numbers updated super slow reason.

Third, vaccines coming! don’t rely Pfizer Moderna forever. J&amp;J AstraZeneca likely approved next two months, Novavax spring. time April/May come around we’ll enough availability vaccinate everyone wants it. It’s accurate headline don’t know misleading people notion governments Omni-potent god like. Things like vaccines policies take time.

Oh president associated wrong party now.



Vaccine numbers continue look better, grow exponentially short term! people think number week week also factor thinking. school would shut til vaciine would okay...  ra ......ra Logistics way simpler Israel due size country. government also better job.

The UK US 3rd 4th best, respectively, terms per-capita US world leader raw distribution number doses administered. Exactly this. Everyone spouting effectiveness one dose. data superfluous. data collected first shot second shot, that's it. Nothing conclusive gained it. conclusive approved trial results done two doses. minimum missing people needing second shot. Maybe read understand something talking it.

The 0.5/1 dose regimen part trial include anyone 55 occurred true error. MHRA approved citing need additional information reason. approved 2 full dose one include people 55 trial original purpose trial. entire point wrong, said thing days ago. go get AIDS harm anyone else process. I’d say vastly different. man holding rallies associated party denying science, getting people killed process. midst public health crisis, part solution get fuck way stop spreading lies. harming people rhetoric, won’t shed tear you. Silver lining: seeing rich powerful celebrities jump line change minds many people would otherwise skeptical vaccine. reporting delays certainly still issue things unacceptable. delay design: Hospitals want vaccinate entire departments once, case side effects force workers out.

Then would order doses could use?

All vaccine shipments use lose it. one week. use it, fined supply taken future orders. Why? Man thats crazy. think would want start vaccinations asap considering situation countries right covid. covid control right Netherlands feel delay vaccinations bad? India one largest protests month now. quite amazing despite tens thousands people camped together, little mask wearing, number covid cases India dramatically increased. 

I wonder is. 77% UK. I'm happy that. know drops significantly people age 40 long accepted risk population that's main thing Spanish Flu took 675,000. almost 340,000.  sadly soon. Germany get millions doses approved. EU ordered 300 million Germany large chunk this. assuming lineback; heavy positions

...wait... atletes.... us fit...

this virus going cost lives health generation come Are...are drunk? discussion that's already happened significance death rate percentage? still around 0.01%? 

This attempt push ""it's big deal"" narrative, keeping data changes. Earlier pandemic read estimates 2-2.5. completely unscientific personal experience that’s happened work crew ship. Patient zero displayed symptoms, 2 days later 2 people displayed symptoms. Brought boat everyone tested, additional 4 people tested positive either pre asymptomatic. additional 4 went test positive isolation initial test. made military take whole damn program. Put flight lanes...enough space miles put logistics base, things large enough warehouses fit even mom. Bruh, want allowed healthcare. I'm deemed unworthy healthcare US. Look data link. 

Look data moron. TEN TIMES amount cases per capita TWICE amount vaccinations per capita... Idk people talk mass amounts people moving cities like it’s good thing. increasing population increased interaction animals destroy habitats increased millions decided want leave city build wasteful suburban house. ain’t anything good. we’ve passed like $3 trillion COVID relief

And corporations relieved reaponsibility, stockholders relieved. Relief accomplished! Holy shit, vaccinate everone age 65 first, open fuck month. 500k 9 days nothing. missing? **China's positivity rates less 1/10th ours** 

And stated ""several orders magnitude"" correct China's rates would 1/1000th ours.

It's fault phrased wrong. Calm fuck down. said activate, federalize, no, want federal government this. wants states it. Wish option AZ vaccine Germany. hope grandparents get Biontech one time. Wtf! Click article look pictures slim person. decision made couple weeks ago though, around time UK virus discovered, doubt direct connection that. Wow, story week old, thanks update Inspector. new drugs. thing clinical proof reduces mortality dexamethasone. Using steroids lung inflammation new revelation. high flow oxygen. Everyone world this. death rate thing without hospital care would high, likely 5%+.

The main thing learned early ventilation work go long. 

Remdesivir reduce mortality antibody drugs practical administer, they're statistically irrelevant. drugs failed. think skepticism botched trials. feels like pulling together data put best story. easier get behind vaccine say ""in trial 30k people, vaccine showed 60% efficacy two vaccines spaced 5 weeks apart"". harder get behind ""our vaccine 70% effective, 90% effective half dose trial 2500 people 60% effective full dose 4 weeks apart, may 95% effective space vaccine 2-3 months apart, data unpublished winning vaccine"". apparently Israel seems fastest vaccinating population. Curious UK US can't fast considering also fairly wealthy countries. Israel doses available population right alot better distribution? happened husband, he's always fear needles.

He getting shot sick. doctor actually uncle. lying shot. minute shot, stood immediately passed out, head hit door jamb, severe concussion remember anything New Year (this like February March 2006, think).

His uncle (the doctor) actually really excited first time ever got see concussion progress beginning. drove husband ""home."" put ""home"" quotes husband (then boyfriend) remember actually moved parents' house roommates.

I went visit him, told work later day stay long. time came leave, surprised/disappointed work... even though already told work.

Eventually mind came back normal, wild ride. Interested anyone information mainstream media (at least UK, elsewhere?) aren’t reporting inside hospitals. TikTok videos health care professionals pouring hearts nothing media. can’t help wonder showing scenes inside ICUs etc. wouldn’t help make “real” taking seriously. Developmentally disabled. Medically fragile particular might things like needing trach, feeding tube, ventilator, etc. 

(This complete list, going friend’s medically fragile son needs.) america bad upvotes please ehh, maybe 1 entire year case anyone wants research it, it’s Dexamethasone, methathone. look trade name Decadron. ""Science-moderated sub"" ass. quite buying that. No, trying make look like biggest vaccination effort history. biggest vaccination fuckup history. pointing fact managed make umpteen million doses success, that's easy part. That's part grift. That's always easy part. hard part spreading organized way getting arms 330 million people quickly. even trying. dumping randomly states saying ""you figure out.  STATES RIGHTS!!1!"". getting rich buddies shot first, course. 


We see greatest vaccination effort us history start 3 weeks, grownups charge, inauguration. That's also first clear picture great mismanagement is. wuhan, many cities, returned months.

at least good news tha china's economy surpass USA's 5 years faster 99% people think anything sub legit brain damage. tons pic twitter show he’s wearing mask others around. condolences first dose confers 70% immunity studies. vulnerable immunized 3 months death rate hospitalization rate plummet March. 

By summer vaccinated first dose vulnerable populations second. allow things like indoor dining/shopping live events. may capacity restrictions mask requirements place throughout 2021. we'll begin entering stages towards 2019 normalcy next month two. Yup... Oxford/AZ vaccine costs $3.50 per person. idea got $15 number from....... True. probably see noticeable decline deaths hospitalizations. Sister, mother, brother gotten theirs, dad could waiting cause already covid. also interacts patients time (hospital admin, fills RN shortages needed).

""The data shared us, I'm sure entirely public domain, calculated vaccine efficacy day 22 dose one, time dose two given, figure around 70%,"" said Wei Shen Lim, chair COVID-19 immunisation Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation. 

70% dose 1 Stupidity slow vaccination too. retarded minister thinks ok start 8 January places even later. staring pickachu face numbers infections stay high.

Welcome holland rest EU goes left go right. Go covid long haulers ask concern weaponized diseases, endemic diseases countries common elsewhere (tropical diseases, ex.). thats buy AMZN MELI PYPL stocks realize bolding capitalizing cursing *explicitly admitted* right? ""carried barely virus"" means carried virus, little. positives false. I'd honestly take covid vaccine thats safe effective could choose probably pfizer/moderna. seem effective covid vaccines right now. probably Johnson Johnson since think that's going one dose vaccine honestly dread needle injected lool would prefer one dose. That’s skilled labor men labor men general died.

Millions able bodied young men laborers aren’t dropping dead covid. nightingales ultimately morgue ventilators. staff capacity man main hospital's, absolutely enough man nightingales, especially nightingales even toilets. They're good ventilated patients that's many staff successfully handle ventilated patient. Hopefully make Tory's realise NHS staff need serious funding support, easily crippled something like again. I’m sure you’re avid news reader watcher, new strain covid hasn’t tested vaccines. detected UK morning woke find detected state yesterday. case someone reads headlines only, orders extended solely SoCal San Joaquin Valley.

I’ve heard word thrown around much last 3 years it’s lost 99% meaning. crucial part ""could"". Britain still member would substantial pressure follow route rest EU.

Exactly, UK could principle approved earlier EU made orders, would consequences EU wide ordering (they would likely made us pay deliver till last case punishment/as UK would 'need less' point) UK first world approve Pfizer/BioNTech AstraZeneca/Oxford chinese russian vaccines need special freezers higher efficacy Astrazeneca vaccine.

Before anybody says trustworthy, vaccines tested countries besides Russia China. Sputnik tested Astrazeneca try increase efficacy.  federal government enough rule possibility contagious strain outsoreading others causing surge. Yes, specific. example, wife got vaccinated last week, works non-essential area medicine. thrilled able get it, little surprised. DR works fought hard get office did. knows long would got gotten involved.

The focus right healthcare workers (which makes complete sense) seeing everyone hospital wanted received first dose. far everyone else goes, one seems clue guidance.

Yes get that. 
What though intrinsic value? 
You can’t eat it. 
In actual complete societal collapse, one anything value would want trade it. 

If talking economic crisis, recovery old norms expected perhaps stock gold would advised. 
Even case though, investment markets would probably give better returns. 
Again, assuming recovery normal would happen. us government incompetent get done, it’s corrupt. plenty civil servants could come plan put action. 

As always it’s leadership(management) ulterior motives plays politics. time it’s peoples lives. 

Hell project manager worth weight could put togetherness better plan trump administration. 

The problem isn’t government problem rich powerful special interests brainwashed everyone past 50 years think government problem causing erosion institutions. That's hyperbole bit over-the-top. careful get info. Nope, elderly care homes getting vaccinated time (at least public’s knowledge). Next healthcare workers. marshmallow...

Smores... mmm. fact there's pre-covid scan compare really give us pause drawing conclusions. similar penn state study withdrawn iirc future mutations virus also known either, effective vaccines new strains evolve wild. clue people freaking vaccine rollout.

Just read headlines day get answer. week two ago mostly celebrating existence distribution vaccine everyone happy. full pessimism people freaking out. Pretty par course. government totally fucked ~~this~~ ~~rollout~~

Ftfy lie 
The moment say vaccines effect cases whatever thread restrictions disappear denied cared Everything want say would get thread locked.  Everyone putting USA shame here. VA got like 400 shots 10 days? distributed 11.4 million doses 2.1 million people received first dose. shameful. Sounds like dystopia able verify much immune response long infected. test positive mean much immune response light exposure. approved United States? Currently vaccinating 150k per day. almost 2% population every day. They’re care homes apparently collecting consent families first. say don’t want rush..  Matthew 6:5

an economy closes rest world stock market almost regulation.

fabulous. cases definitely 24h aggie representing worst Texas, surprising all! Mate... one trial 8,895 people efficiency rate 90% one trial 11,636 people efficiency rate 63%. 

The UK gov. approved vaccine basis two full doses (63%) due lack raw data - consider incomplete data - regarding strategy administering half dose full dose. Sure, Russia would probably also it, US history using weapons consider immoral, still fact. Nothing Reddit meme. US literally President got elected motto ""America first"" bombing countries remote controlled drones. hard pressed find someone believe US already weaponized diseases, hence irony original statement short answer no.

The reason booster (ie. 2nd dose) maximize antibody production. get initial dose, mRNA causes cells produce virus proteins. small number unique proteins found Covid-19 virus, reproduce whole virus. uniqueness proteins important causes immune system ultimately produce antibodies specifically target proteins COVID-19 virus. That's fundamentally individual immunity works may virus bacteria.

After initial dose body produce X number antibodies. cases (depending properties virus and/or proteins used vaccine and/or dose), level antibody production quite good enough. neat thing immune system (and fundamentally antibodies work) 2nd exposure proteins kick immediate **targeted** immune response. Notice said initial dose immune system ""ultimately"" produces antibodies... lot steps. Imagine recruit, train, equip, deploy army unexpected alien invasion. Now, 2nd time around, stuff ready primed, might need deploy troops. Antibodies function recognize exact virus based key proteins (or case booster vaccine recognizes proteins alone there's actual virus) kick metabolic cascade blows virus water, compared struggling fight first time around. 

One key factors 2nd wave immune response massive increase number residual antibodies. So, 1st dose produced 100 antibodies stuck around, 2nd produce 10,000 (I'm literally making junk math illustrate, actual numbers would massive). 2nd wave antibody production gives body ability decimate virus ever makes sick and, importantly population-level immunity, build enough viral load become contagious. Disclaimer: perfect, tell 90-ish% efficacy, basically vaccine dosing schedule meant work.

The 1st dose alone work intended bit... meh. 2nd dose really gives person powerful, lasting immunity minimizes transmission.

So, there's background, directly answer question. targeted immune response body produces going accelerate genetic mutations virus. either work work ward virus. mutation naturally occurs spreads (eg. UK variant that's news) theoretically possible current vaccine lose effectiveness. vaccine cause kind mutation though, increase transmission rate variant. immune response targeted cause kind (un)natural selection occur. selection might see use many antibiotics, inherently 'broad spectrum', kill everything *except* bacteria strains resistant it. allows resistant strain propagate. Here's actual reporting one read article? US population overwhelmingly want this. Well gloating about, contracted disease died.

We enable virus whenever around others. airborne, masks help, slow growth spread 2 percent according studies. sure things put far risk wearing mask.

You wouldn’t want people gloat took risk died would you? assuming Western governments average Western citizen cares enough African Union know dealt Covid. Sweet

No. None common flu. may fatigue, that's it. chronic sob, cognitive changes, loss smell taste. least GOP track get everyone vaccinated 2032. Really? Wow would thought that?! I'm laypeople want help educate Americans subject (which believe scientists build PR campaign combat misinformation) 

They have. CDC, NIAID, number public advocacy groups that. That's see Anthony Fauci interviewed don’t link single publication I’m supposed believe you. 

With due respect (which frankly running low given lack respect shown me), laypeople lack ability read synthesize learnings across academic publications. experience, people tend skim cherry pick phrases papers suit interests fail internalize actual learnings publication. also struggle critically evaluate statistical weight results they're shown fail appreciate uncertainty findings broader context. Also, phone standing, making harder quickly gather Reddit mostly full Left wing white Indian folks search internet research

Huh? reddit left wing white Indian therefore I'm scientist? many scientists know? know lot reddit... we're mostly introverts like online. running mouth stuff know nothing about. That's data accurate. thing updated. thought you. time, many people saw China's response draconian unnecessary, could curbed cooperative response.

EVEN 51% people can't minimize risk that's still around 100 million people fall 49% leave room improvement. could know 20-30% deniers even get 50% take seriously take seriously lot room minimize risk. countries responses clear proof almost infinite room improvement US response. 

Other nations higher population density TOTAL deaths thousand. Japan **223,120** cases **3,306** deaths. population 126 million median age 25% higher US. Either genetically MUCH resistant complete fools handling pandemics. 

You're realistic bad US response compared countries, rich poor.

No country failing hard American low population, plenty wealth, isolation. advantages performing well third world countries, also industrialized nations much high population density.

But agreed, time telll. could get vaccinations one dose (without needing booster), I’d ok getting every year needed. would pain get three shots three different appointments (flu shot, covid vaccine, covid booster) Grandma made appointment first week January. initially going wait everyone else around got realized too. think might doses per 100,000 population. guess domino effect happening there, cool. we’re starting learn long-term effects survive, like psychiatric don’t know you, I’ve flu didn’t end suffering PTSD dementia.  late?

He's guy calling Fauci liar idiot lmao. Drew clearly changed stance since March anyone changes opinion better face new knowledge worthy retribution (as long past actions cause deaths others). Guess see coming weeks  Agreed, seems heartless. Also, people forgetting there's never mRNA vaccine. experimental animal trials skipped. want play safe? school went online saw big difference came mask wearing use hand sanitizers women men, often classroom almost men sometimes wore masks wrong way usually wore chins . 

I saw one woman comletely ignore rules like ""couldnt breathe"" due asthma (trust lying, inconvenience somehow got away it) otherwise rest women kept masks 95% time, classrooms like saunas would often take breathe bit put back on. 

Not saying women classes perfect clear difference following mask mandate rule. 

Big gap using hand sanitizers available school etc go full detail there.

This probably also contributes men seem contract Covid women possibly death rate also higher men many areas.

In retrospect, I'm guessing checking see would need watched not. end stay. Oh good lord. Tell actual story, bullshit.

[Here's notes left embelished.

1. found reputable source calling Disney exec. ""employee"" ever used. 

2. Hospital stating vaccine surplus. Everyone wanted one gotten one option throw away. Now, want dispute this, means do, run around posting without vital context. That’s it? According Bloomberg's tracker, [around 20,000,000 first doses issue seems ability hospitals actually inject them. almost seems like Slaoui ended achieving goal distributing 20,000,000 vaccines December, factors local level prevented getting people's arms. I'm sure things mitigate hope hospital situation improves quickly.

This big reason I'm happy CVS Walgreens beginning handle injections. mean speak ill medical workers, pharmacies much experience vaccinating public, main example annual flu vaccines. really believe they'll end much, much quicker hospitals doing. vulnerable without elderly... CDC says it’s surge Got it. Don’t agree. gonna hurt you. Worst case scenario vaccine isn’t effective. already getting opened last summer not? already spent month although loved kids probably go flatter area next. Show people spreading AIDS rallies denying science behind it, I’ll say fuck then. You’re grasping straws Business could still keep offices they'll simply require smaller offices. Like say law firms marketing firms still need office meet clients meeting clients work home instead. spreads first week infection kills *less one percent cases* typically third week.

FTFY collapse resource good mental space get there. browse, comment, take things suggestions research using additional sources. think small parts society gone good? Yeah. Maybe get rid things like drinking fountains increase hand hygeine good. that, get back normal eventually. Climate change problem, extinct decade. good place find new things keep eye on, even look one source. going to, let source, LOL. Yes higher risk mutations mink farms absolute ideal environment virus spread rapidly evolve. working vaccine, last thing want virus mutate way makes vaccine less effective. weaponized Covid-19 Yeah remember formula positivity rate different states. Florida takes number new positive cases day divides *all* tests conducted day.

So test positive 3 days row- first test counts positive, 2 subsequent tests would effectively count ""negative result"" report percentage tests came back positive. compassion AIDS victims Covid victims? wealth young people love break rules.

Oh dear, ""I believe everything read conservative press"" alert. I'm sure there'll pearls wisdom Boris ass-kissing here.  
 they’re getting awful lot stick deserve. 
 
Oh I'm shocked. surprise. mRNA vaccine that’s never really tested humans, can’t believe people okay 3million us getting without long term study.... Influenza work like that. circulating flus today variants Spanish Flu. reason second Pandemic wave Spanish Flu bad humans unknowingly selected deadly strain front lines. Soldiers sick, could still stand shoot stayed trenches. Soldiers worse sent back behind lines, spread virus nurses, doctors, caregivers, civilians, people contact civilians. soldier sent medical facilities due reasons brought virus back front lines, creating feedback loop. Fuck initially optimistic MARCH American response pandemic would better, right? *That's* part argument attack? Lol. say linked covid19 kinda dumb. dont even control group. compare rate heart damage non-covid group. going happen. would accepted whole ‘women primary victims war’ totally accepted fact AIDS easier avoid seems making case even appropriate gloat AIDS victim’s death easily effectively prevented. 

And yet still find distasteful. Alex, I'll take ""The FDA vs ever heard site"" 1000. Operation Thrusters cruising along. stupid inbred dipshit could’ve taken easy steps contract deadly, communicable disease didn’t. were, they've *very* hard time commercialization. side effects get significant repeated doses applications. use drug delivery mechanism, weigh delivery enough therapeutic drug side effects. Vaccines, hand, perfect application need one two doses body rest. long holiday season even 7-day average looks pretty distorted. That's true vaccines. government fund suing manufacturer. I'm runner. Normally I'm sleeping lying RHR around 55-60. I'm sitting up, might around 60-65 even 70 I'm amped I'm doing. I'm sitting recliner watching TV zoned out, going 60-65. got covid back March standard respiratory symptoms, catch breath ran fever maybe 5-6 hrs tops. symptom worried racing heart rate. would 80 bpm sometimes even 90 laying couch trying die. Normally HR 60ish state, 80-90. symptom went away healed up. 

FWIW, never tested covid either time testing people actively running fever several hours ran fever condition go anywhere anything wish death. know least dozen people close contact infected ended hospital (testing positive) least dozen also sick never got tested. church center outbreak back lockdown even started I'm 99% sure it. symptoms hospital. That's good analogy. would maybe add something gravity non-believers forcing ""fake gravity"" others. I.e. pushing gravity believers various windows laughing b/c think injuries resulted. 2021 gonna like disaster movie sequels, take everything went wrong first one ratchet another level. Politics. People want blame president anything can. Eh, Thanksgiving spike played out. think we're going trending 3500 countries uniform start. Netherlands extremely fast purchasing/reserving right receive vaccines. EU Gov asked Netherlands others sell deals EU could distributed evenly. Otherwise, would start seeing headlines rich western European countries got vaccinated, southern eastern European countries would excluded (as many vaccines already bought richer countries, way risk part vaccine work, money would gone) wait longer. 

Netherlands others sacrificed greater good EU. deserve praise. Covid like 2 months ago, since last week I’ve weird chest pains heart side chest. Nothing major, like air stuck. I’ve keeping bpm check everything normal. Unfortunately don’t money health insurance moment, I’ve stopped physical activities, except intercourse gruel friend guess Thanks Good, keeping others safe! True Loveline fans know Adam never leaves couch. hell man, France actually functional national Healthcare system too. guess US alone completely unprepared defending virus. kids growing without father. fault, suffer.   Sir, fear mongering subreddit. also less that. deal AstraZeneca made Oxford University allowed make money developed countries. India paying much less EU. Yeah numbers bad reporting wonky holidays. Lots states made reports days.

Things still terrible trending worse day day numbers place. Every time got anthrax vaccine hurt all...my whole arm went numb got semi-parilized state hours. know describe it, hold pen would flop numb arm around working arm. sure physical office presence still needed firms. even like say marketing firm really need staff physically in? mean bet could say half staff working home rest office personal client interaction etc. think businesses could atleast staff working home sure screen cap hand quote FB posts back her. Exactly this. I'll happily wear mask public long takes, can't wait fear life people around irresponsible. reject concept whatabouting bad thing. 

It necessary bring things context. agree titles shouldn’t editorialized part factually incorrect? Seems accurate like people say flu vaccine give flu someone showed flu symptoms couple days later getting it. accepting already infected flu received it. Read said it’s something like 70% effective first dose. Thanks. thought United States delivered doses. Actually I’m pretty sure have. Also helps biggest holiday year going on. sad part lack PPE compared countries. watching [76 Ai Weiwei's Coronation documentary, feel sorry sad US health care essential workers. good amount americans follow public health policies top US government officials actively promote disinformation. US federal government allowed US states compete PPE. Healthcare workers China much PPE, worry amount medical waste generate. Even delivery volunteers China PPE ER doctors US. Health care workers constantly exposed COVID19, US government seem offer much support. regularly interact civilian tech guys always tell former Navy nuke guys lead lol.  exactly problem. hospitals area 80% full weeks now, drive one them, it’s quiet. You’d never know what’s going unless you’re following raw data put state. Even local news stopped sounding alarm bells they’d saying thing every day. don’t ability actually go COVID wards cameras show chaos that’s invisible rest us. Considering Dr. Drew's opinions COVID like asking Dr. Fauci monitor rehab facility houses Z-tier celebrities. get better 1/20/2021 true. look news, says banning foreigners, addition “The rules apply individuals Hong Kong, Macau, China.”

It’s kind like Hawaii saying banning foreigners, rule apply Alaska lower states. say that? saying end March. Here's greatest hits March surprise all, virus mutate. one talking increased ability spread mortality rate drops? actions like locking banning international travel doable everywhere, get stuck population lots examples like China, Korea, Vietnam, Australia. good news myocarditis treatable permanent (and covid virus causes this). Cardiac screening definitely performed athletes prior returning activity. lives matter? dead? I'm Virginia quite literally every f****** thing open except one building might need, unemployment office.


These people strung up. Yes, Governor DeSantis. I'm sure know best, Governor DeSantis. frankly dumb idea tell group known meme disdain toward older people (""Okay b\*\*m\*r""), mostly kills older people.

A dumb idea accurately report circumstances virus? Kids partying want boomers die, they're partying want party. like one access social psychologists guess folks (especially teens) would behave

There's reason guys work call boomer doomer  Sorry loss clarity, people rely journalists give aren’t willing read past headlines. 

It’s really hard understand spend even 5 minutes looking background figures. 

People like Pfizer Moderna media gave one nice figure dosing regime simple brains could understand. Yet Reddit media obsessed tearing apart every step every trial AstraZeneca run. 

There many trials cohorts running parallel Astra Zeneca trail, apparently people can’t get brains panic seeing multiple figures. Well, smallpox vaccine least.

Abstract

Myocarditis significant cause sudden cardiac death competitive athletes occur normal ventricular function.1 Recent studies raised concerns myocardial inflammation recovery coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), even asymptomatic mildly symptomatic patients.2 objective investigate use cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging competitive athletes recovered COVID-19 detect myocardial inflammation would identify high-risk athletes return competitive play.

Methods

We performed comprehensive CMR examination including cine, T1 T2 mapping, extracellular volume fraction, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), 1.5-T scanner (Magnetom Sola; Siemens Healthineers) using standardized protocols,3 competitive athletes referred sports medicine clinic testing positive COVID-19 (reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction) June August 2020. Ohio State University institutional review board approved study, informed consent writing obtained participating athletes. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging performed recommended quarantine (11-53 days). Electrocardiogram, serum troponin I, transthoracic echocardiogram performed day CMR imaging.

Results

We performed CMR imaging 26 competitive college athletes (mean [SD] age, 19.5 [1.5] years; 15 male [57.7%]) following sports: football, soccer, lacrosse, basketball, track. athletes required hospitalization received COVID-19–specific antiviral therapy. Twelve athletes (26.9%; including 7 female individuals) reported mild symptoms short-term infection (sore throat, shortness breath, myalgias, fever), others asymptomatic. diagnostic ST/T wave changes electrocardiogram, ventricular volumes function within normal range athletes transthoracic echocardiogram CMR imaging. athlete elevated serum levels troponin I. Four athletes (15%; male individuals) CMR findings consistent myocarditis based presence 2 main features updated Lake Louise Criteria: myocardial edema elevated T2 signal myocardial injury presence nonischemic LGE (Figure).4 Pericardial effusion present 2 athletes CMR evidence myocarditis. Two 4 athletes evidence myocardial inflammation mild symptoms (shortness breath), 2 asymptomatic. Twelve athletes (46%) LGE (mean 2 American Heart Association segments), 8 (30.8%) LGE without concomitant T2 elevation (Table). Mean (SD) T2 suspected myocarditis 59 (3) milliseconds compared 51 (2) milliseconds without CMR evidence myocarditis.

Discussion

Of 26 competitive athletes, 4 (15%) CMR findings suggestive myocarditis 8 additional athletes (30.8%) exhibited LGE without T2 elevation suggestive prior myocardial injury. COVID-19–related myocardial injury competitive athletes sports participation remains unclear. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging potential identify high-risk cohort adverse outcomes may, importantly, risk stratify athletes safe participation CMR mapping techniques high negative predictive value rule myocarditis.4 recent study Puntmann et al2 demonstrated cardiac involvement significant number patients recovered COVID-19. recent expert consensus article recommended 2-week convalescence followed diagnostic cardiac testing asymptomatic electrocardiogram transthoracic echocardiogram mildly symptomatic athletes COVID-19 return play competitive sports.5 However, emerging knowledge CMR observations question recommendation. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging evidence myocardial inflammation associated poor outcomes, including myocardial dysfunction mortality.6 Study limitations include lack baseline CMR imaging variable timing CMR imaging positive COVID-19 test result. Athletic cardiac adaptation could responsible abnormalities; however, cohort, mean (SD) T2 suspected myocarditis 59 (3) milliseconds vs 51 (2) milliseconds without, favoring pathology. Additionally, rate LGE (42%) higher previously described normative populations. conclude, long-term follow-up large studies including control populations required understand CMR changes competitive athletes, CMR may provide excellent risk-stratification assessment myocarditis athletes recovered COVID-19 guide safe competitive sports participation. good news them: aren’t first take it, millions already Yes, mean people full blown flu say never another flu vaccine ever Low hanging fruit give estimate general population get vaccine? like official definition outside free meet requisites nation prior national unification, following articles ROC Constitution added amended ROC Constitution accordance Article 27, Paragraph 1, Item 3; Article 174, Item 1: Stronghold crusader flashbacks Wanna bet?

Sure, football team makes money, womens rifle team not.

Each every student OSU pays athletic fee support varsity athletics. France Spain mandated masks middle summer, long second wave hit real. think tied President office, think normal difficulty setting distribution channel initially. get groove, especially vaccines approved, it'll go much faster. Im Los Angeles mann new mutation expected show exponential growth. R0 50% larger, would mean less doubling every week. However, exponential growth early stage slow. would take weeks becomes really noticeable, handful cases beginning. Even far late stop two months time. people already got vaccine unlucky?  RemindMe! 10 years ""Is US covid-vaccinated yet?"" hospitals France never overloaded year.

The government cut 70 000 hospital beds past 15 years.

The biggest problem government telling ppl stay home take tylenol, dangerous ppl get treatment things late. massive leap vaccine technology. like terrible WWII fueled invention efficient combustion engines, pandemic fueled RNA/protein subunit vaccines. really think voters remember little Abbott Patrick protect state pandemic they'll send wheeling.

Nah, learn lesson. They'll vote back. received first dose two-dose vaccine. Even second dose, no-one ever claimed 100% effective. efficacy very, clearly communicated 95% doses. course people still going contract disease. Earlier month people saying opposite, makes COVID think anyone really knows. known covid19 vaccines available today one could choose, one would pick why? Keep looking. try come back post links... idea. mean work wear FFP3s. think surgical masks whatnot certainly help keep those. get vaccine earliest opportunity! did, severe constraint appears availability glass vials.

I read presently UK 20 million doses 5 million doses worth vials.

Not sure there's exact numbers correct, going chokepoint many vaccines think. Elbert County outside Denver, 50 miles southeast. adjacent Denver County, county between.    
It's would call right next middle nowhere. 

Community spread middle nowhere... everywhere. Polio drops?....? „To ensure widely deployed COVID-19 vaccine effective, primary efficacy endpoint point estimate placebo-controlled efficacy trial least 50%, statistical success criterion lower bound appropriately alpha-adjusted confidence interval around primary efficacy endpoint point estimate FDA thinks Vaccine effective efficacy 50%

The Biontech/Pfizer vaccine efficacy 12 days first shot 52%.

Do write conclusion you? Buckle buckaroo! Every day december 6th deaths added yesterday: lag reporting getting longer longer. half deaths reported 7 days delay takes 2-3 weeks 90 % reported: Swedish authorities mostly shut Christmas New Years, updating statistics 29/12, 30/12, 5/1, 7/1, 8/1 making lag even worse. actual number deaths December known end january. Every stadium dozens sub zero freezers. Think much food sell &amp;#x200B;

We know what's going hospitals. hear you, Praying you. wish could wave wand make go away. support love prayers. strong alone. need vaccinate 70+ pandemic seem inexistent arm pretty sore 12 hours, that’s it. transport. extremely difficult store, thus transport vaccines, Israel's size definitely gives advantage countries. land area approximately size state New Jersey. fairness, 40% cases London recently.

The sample size far small. There’s reason UK sequences 10% confirmed cases. transport. extremely difficult store, thus transport vaccines, Israel's size definitely gives advantage countries. land area approximately size state New Jersey. Lab meat. still expensive. Smh.. nurses critical thinking skills. damn sure wanna nurse like taking care me! Even reached full immunity vaccine body work together produce, 5% chance immune, still get virus potentially spread people. point immunity body specifically beat virus without much trouble. actually mean immune virus. Unfortunately bad terminology chosen many decades ago. call varying levels immune resistance immunity even actually make immune.

Even people immunity get virus spread people far know.

We know rate that's going be, might low, able verify sterilizing immunity high rate.

So talk immunity mean capacity person gets infected fairly easily beat virus.

We mean kind immunity virus bounces them, can't spread actually immune.

The number one problem viral immunity really mean immune mean immune life though mean immune mean immune life.

Survivor immunity specific scientific term, general term applies several different modes immune system able handle type viral threat handle means beat get seriously sick die. Nobody knows waiting longer okay. That’s got everybody certain intervals testing. 

That said, stretched hpv series (because lazy young adult) told pose issue all. think good idea, even flu shot. frequency issue. mean... things cost money outside government money. 

Police Justice system, firefighters imo also basic healthcare education. antivax community going love seeing headlines. Headlines like dangerous know people love read headlines freak read whole story. wouldn’t mad grabbed Gatorade Zero really count people then. think, seeing parking lot field hospitals set state, see that. know why, rates lower places. mean, numbers:

 

* Monday: 22.75%
* Sunday: 11.89%
* Saturday: 9.69%
* Friday: 8.00%
* Thursday: 7.86%

You really think values doubled overnight, you? This. many people seem realize this.

I really fed scientist telling bad news family, people really realize bad looks unless US takes strong collective action. gave elderly decrepit. don’t read much this. People need comment engraves brains Wow gross negligence. poor man. time Blade Runner 2 kick off! guess showed libs! think mean *if* 3 million Americans vaccinated every day, that’s 1% US population. know 300-400 people (a quick google search suggests people know more) you’d know 3-4 people vaccinated given day, average. 

However, US administered 2.3 million doses date. know least 4 people gotten COVID vaccine, may didn’t advertise social media tell me. number friends/family healthcare field. Yep, Californians done listening orders. I'm seeing people adamant supporters lock starting let guard even they're still vocally supportive. top that, UI enough lot people lost income working less. I'm definitely feeling like state nearing breaking point Covid-19 hospitals mentally well. look deep see looks like people normal possible talking knowing completely different. seems like terrible way wage war, way protect population. worthwhile weapon run death cult, nation, especially vaccine (and enough doses whole country) ready yourself. I'm hurry vaccinated. want see results public administration first. mention political parties primary colors, probably get removed mods. parents want go Florida February. I'm epidemiologist I'm tearing hair out. wait two months vaccine!! Florida deserves zero tourism dollars anyone terribly they've handled this. Ugh. Unsure US vaccines Oxford vaccine approved second dose 1-3 months. UK switched strategy people delay second vaccines slightly. 

I think dependent country many vaccines order. vaccines way per person, likely delay second vaccine assurance still get within 3 month window. might work us UK small population tens millions vaccines coming quickly, may work country needing vaccines bigger population. 

It’s safe bet think many countries would conservative understandably so. always get flu shot grocery pharmacy. always ask leave store 30min alert someone start side-effects. super enforce it, see want covid conspiracy such. dog's insulin syringes, huh?

Do know body part insulin syringe targeting? body part appropriate vaccine? outdated. It’s June. Death tragic. Especially easy avoided.  Think feds didnt pay. also habe transport pfitzer vaccine frozen. something every trailer do. stored way well. extremely cold temps. 

Logistically need enough people ready abd willing vaccinated ship there. Otherwise wasted Maybe it’s bit there’s evidence it’s massively different press release link mentioned really truly elder population gets vaccinated much restrictions left hospitalizations course deaths 65+ crowd

That's completely true certainly scientific consensus. We'll still need wear masks avoid indoor gatherings achieve herd immunity. virus still screws health healthy people, third deaths due covid 65. third 5-600k deaths expect end thing lot dead Americans losing lives prime.

Those us lucky enough get innoculated early freedoms, us less lucky continue take precautions stay healthy. summer bring return outdoor gatherings us colder climates, help decrease case counts vaccinate, 70-90% population gets doses.

So, appreciate optimism, think fooling think things going back normal summer. expecting extend fall/winter 2021, though bad winter. I'm math didn’t get second dose could infected initial dose. we'll rest go away right? Ahh... absolutely expected result considering one shot grant 100% immunity... everyone panic. Yes picture Vegas, Macau, bad photoshop? May ask old are? Seems strange learning 1917/18 pandemic? Let's optimistic. Initially Pfizer rolling vaccine, Moderna Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine looming ahead. Anybody know find info activities risky this? Bit worried even though don’t see anybody, could caught even outside pass someone, mail?? That's unfortunate. Hopefully vaccine still positive effect her. Worked without tik tok account Thats gonna happen. Thats logistical nightmare seriously suggesting MHRA comprised review process nationalism, AZ focusing home market? really thought it'd Adam Carolla we'd reading first. currently known rate immunity causes unable get virus. Immunity different different people really personal immune system virus interact basically there's lot unknown chemical reaction outcomes degree can't exactly like 100% rely immune system produce predictable results every virus even virus different people. like big chemical soup showdown chemicals different people actually exactly plus immune system react good react. fact immune system antibodies guarantee immune system easily beat virus. works viruses better others really look specifically type immunity generated virus specific host. 

In case currently immunity means able beat virus. False negatives around 20% accurate, would rely negative results. tests tell it, can't tell don't. see there's UCL study buy it, US CDC suggesting IFR 1 anywhere except Japan.

Antibodies detectable 6 months seroprevalence study must surely miss many infected Spring. evidence whatsoever yet Pacman Fever. Thanks. also impression trusted news site say like normal made wonder. guess news site ""trusted"" blindly! well put, fingers crossed things start move right direction! He. GBS cases occurred 362 patients 6 weeks influenza vaccination 45 million persons

6 weeks long term. Btw, flu greater chance causing GBS. one wants this.

It sucks.

But constant denial got us here.

Had taken seriously like Taiwan did, we’d sitting pretty right now.

But Trump trusted China despite intelligence basic photos proving issue China. let damn thing fester country, still 346,579 deaths still denial...

Even evidence turns out, expectations, vaccine prevent spread, still expect dramatically reduce it. know vaccine good reducing symptom severity, good evidence reducing symptoms also reduce transmission.

Not say vaccine generates immunity necessarily mean actually immune virus sense bounces nothing.

Viral immunity mean immune system strong enough beat virus still spread it.

Or viral immunity mean immune system strong enough beat virus get symptoms can't spread it.

You see viral immunity one term means one thing. There's different types immunity lump together one phrase immunity. 

Unfortunately real life actually simple different types immunities different qualities. developing countries cold chain Pfizer vaccine complex make meaningful difference, Oxford one big deal. infrastructure required challenging even developed countries, look difficulties Germany Spain had.

Today's deaths figure highest since 9 April.” Terrifying. Good thing apathy supercedes right infringe apathy. Lol work minimum wage McDonald's, catch coughing cup fam Cases matter much hospitalizations. incapable using Google yourself? 

If so, that's quite embarrassing. huh..? wants kinda run semantics here.

Generally, yeah. Significant enough different biology almost certainly considered new strain. There’s good amount debate article gives pretty solid definition lineage vs variant vs strain and, I’d say, pretty close consensus 🤦 vaccine goes 11 Theoretically could nothing world would that? Death isn’t issue COVID-19, even young people long term consequences getting virus. Sign up! found it. mostly memory based get degree/good gpa. remember long enough test. dont need critical thinking that. Private profit companies way efficient making profit, administering vaccines rapidly huge numbers people. bosses allow co-workers walk around masks dick nosing mask long front customer, need get video case need try Sue 


One co-workers 62 year old woman still serves tables. finally got fed asked two younger girls would feel Barbra died? Would feel like partially responsible since literally walk around masks day?


They know say. Like, looks like never even considered possibility.


And one people dental assistant part-time.


Just shockingly stupid competent nurse able vaccinate someone every minute two, lets say 30 60 hour right.

Hell, used use high pressure guns! fair second third degree burns head toe. would've impressive found way mummy wrap without cutting off. US unique - nice summary UK response hit hard yesterday becaise country (Poland) failed similar way: vaccines.

You should, every vaccine, shot blood draw I've needle stick, get fuck office I'm charging more. think kind both? 50% chance 100% immune now, cant 100% 0, know vaccine protects severe forms disease even one actually develops despite jab. Savage. 😂😂😂 least Oxford vaccine approved UK today effective new variant Yes, know vaccines immune system reacts them. assume vaccine work, assume work vaccines correct model get data. 70% effective 22 days according MHRA. second jab improves effectiveness administered 1-3 months first. AstraZeneca still hasn’t applied Emergency Use authorization FDA United States, correct? disputing truthfulness comment getting frustrated? It’s fascinating is.
At least new administration taking seriously I’m confident much better shape next spring earliest Slap figures many vaccinated people still contracting spreading disease, showing symptoms? I've read couple articles stating worry. figure is? even work covid heavy area work what's considered super cushy job (PACU) even I'm stressed non stop shit. still get covid patients still know what's going happen. matter time get shut I'm shoved back ER ICU.

I can't even imagine ER, ICU, covid units experiencing. heart breaks them. think trebuchet would work better lob objects 95 kg 300 meters. think one abstainer independent FDA board meeting said best. emergency use authorization overly broad. point even vaccine infrequent serious side affects, evidence does, did, probably still makes sense offer high risk populations like nurses COVID floor. person locked house using instacart equation probably different. None matters, CDC rollout plan essentially high risk people going first anyway. 

Also Pfizer said expects file full approval April get much information than. That’s fucking made it.

They likely took live coronavirus bat exposed human cells, cultured it. got (reasons unknown irrelevant). explains virus infectious people species (granted, that’s possible considering mutations, don’t know original samples never obtained).

I would bet won’t find virus nature. else would controlling secretive global pandemic virus? Adam downplaying mocking it? Seems like he’s Trump guy, last times heard him, wouldn’t surprise me. really grown hate him. Wait... I've seen thus movie thing conspiracy theorists matter happens, they'll see confirming delusions. really winning them. Gotta get everyone nice healthy go back maiming Palestinians bulldozing homes olive groves... impression recall supporters working install someone gives *more* shit virus, badly mistaken. Fuck Israel much money give year...this vaccine actually subsidized US tax payer!!!! would much efficient get rid phases try vaccinate many people possible. idea turn even come practically salivating vaccine meanwhile hear dumbasses refusing it. sure, Alaska I’m California, recovered COVID. caught randomly somehow despite wearing mask carrying sanitizer everywhere. haven’t seen anyone socially months. figure elevator building grocery store.   title post mischaracterizes said. quote Dutch health official Ewout Fanoy. published papers disease probably dummy. quote discussion outbreak happened Dutch school: outbreak school investigated GGD. ""Forty people tested positive, least five British variant"", says GGD doctor Ewout Fanoy. remains determined others. ""It likely 40 people British variant."" suspects people area also become infected, yet reported GGD.  says striking many young children become ill school. ""They seriously ill, real symptoms. still assumption British variant contagious children also produces mild symptoms little often.""  thought children participate much corona, tilt picture. children especially annoying, bad. difficult question things opening schools.""

He's saying anything like ""we idea kids get Covid"", despite implication title post. Fragrance causing polyps you? Thanks exchange, good luck friends! evidence, almost every expert said vaccines likely work new strain. resting heart rate I'm laying around 55-60. Gets lower I'm sleeping. never gets 100 unless I'm walking around. MBAs hate math nerds 😜  Mate, link literally proves dosing regimen (n=2,741) showed vaccine efficacy 90% AZD1222 given half dose, **followed full dose least one month apart, another dosing regimen (n=8,895) showed 62% efficacy given two full doses least one month apart. combined analysis dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted average efficacy 70%.** results statistically significant (p&lt;=0.0001). data continue accumulate additional analysis conducted, refining efficacy reading establishing duration protection.

Jesus. right there.

They mixed data different studies get higher percentage. studies less 10 thousand people. Go ahead cite them, then. like way rrr technically, nation wanted attack another nation biological weapon, vaccinate people launching focused attack (via somehow introducing virus onto enemy nations) [archive link anyone trouble accessing article think crowing odd too. focus back yard instead someone else's? think funny? What's matter you? That's awesome. think would hard prove could see totally abused used wrong. absurd that's okay people. Oh sorry realize using outdated information. Happy get speed!
  UK's COVID-19 vaccine chair, Wei Shen Lim, said single dose Oxford/AstraZeneca's vaccine **around 70% effective 21 days second dose given 12 weeks.**
 UK Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) cleared one doubt raised Oxford data, saying 90% success rate half-dose followed full dose stood analysis.
  Munir Pirmohamed, chair government working group COVID-19 vaccines involved approval, said that, two full doses given three months apart, ""effectiveness high, 80% ... reason recommendation"".
   y'all think get point eventually? 3 million people per day? 

I really hope Question: half population get vaccinated could virus run rampant them, mutate thus create vaccine ineffective? big ass trucks freezers/refrigerators depending need. know time received placebo vaccine unblinded later? Wednesday, Sweden said registered 8,846 new coronavirus cases 243 deaths, highest Sweden since pandemic began, although health agency said statistics Christmas period skewed less testing delays reporting deaths. Mr. Long previous health issues, including blood clots lungs legs several years ago irregular heartbeat requiring implanted heart monitor 2018

Dude fat previous issues. Welp get angst also think general public clear idea complexities undertaking. I'm hoping bottlenecks appear addressed corrected. also suspect giant data lag regards actual numbers.

So assume succeeded produce million doses ahead time, that's vaccinated thus far? anyone reference article accurately report many doses/day produced PFE MRNA? problem huge distribution/logistics issue?

(Please turn political... genuinely want know fast they're able produce doses!) fair, everyone saying something different masks. Including CDC Fauci, yet they're never called it.

They called LITERALLY everyday. CDC left wing US outlets Fauci Right. possible someone without underlying health problems die COVID 99.99% age peers don't?

This vaccine may work him. good news there’s going 10-100 vaccines next two years work way, We'll still need wear masks avoid indoor gatherings achieve herd immunity.

You keep telling want, honestly think people still going accept restrictions like hospitals sitting empty kidding yourself. soon hospitalization rates dip near flu restrictions over. gonna lie, I'm fine masks ""new normal"" too. mandatory least popular. know many millions hours sick leave US uses per year? flu several billion dollars lost productivity. cut even 20% wearing masks often, there's economic stimulus right there! one-shot data Pfizer statistically significant. protocol followed letter proven trial.

Conservatives split acting like it’s bounds point Letlow anti-masker conspiracy theorist saying COVID Democratic conspiracy Republican politicians getting sick dying it. entire worldview pathologically incapable learning self-reflection. dont see us hitting numbers,I encountered many people get thats me.Dont scared get shot try get back normal true, however reflects general lack attitude, caring virus, domestic flights Xmas, numbers gonna skyrocket soon, wrong entirely. KNOW whether stops transmission definitely know transmission neither know does. trials moderna Pfizer ran attempt determine whether stopped transmission not. Oxfords vaccine attempt track show reduction transmission. personal opinion I'd willing bet greatly reduces chance transmission, that's personal opinion I've gathered far. Messaging who? Members public looking much detail various regulators. questions ask easy answer hasn’t half dose approved. Simply isn’t enough data moment occurred due error. Therefore people given small sample diverse (e.g. one 55). information obvious regulators MHRA didn’t approve (not I’m aware AZ even asked to). problem. mean Rupert Murdoch got vaccine first week, it’s already happening can't say logic end. can't compare flu vaccine extreme handling procedures. information quickly given current usage. fact gone means even increase probably massively increase. months ago people saying would take miracle get vaccine 2020, there’s that. way drive thru flu shot sites. Hopefully one around want try looking up. received 400,000 administered less 80,000.

If administered 350,000, would agree fault people vaccinated dragging ass administration front. tracking vaccinations state state basis long I've alive?

I see novel problem. 

As money ship actual vaccines, I'd like see little info that, shipment seem problem I've seen. 

[This data telling 9.3M vaccines ""delivered"" telling they're centralized locations state? sitting storage hospital/clinic?

(And sources would solid shooting hip CDC means ""delivered"" going convincing) months prepare it, almost nothing could important rollout, it’s botched current (R) administration.

Is clue enough? terrible news. We're point want optimistic, good news vaccines overwhelmed number lives lost daily. Rural internet connections terrible, though. WFH professionals going relocate area can't get reliable internet continue working. Suburbs surrounding large city likely. literally moved away Texas large part, bullshit. Texas nuts say acknowledging huge state lots great people there.

To great people Texas, I'm sorry long. almost like everyone ""America bad"" thing extremely bad faith interested honesty accuracy. I’m aware - said least. probably understaffed haveas much time manipulate data normally do. What's formula use positivity rate again? Oh yeah, it's:

First time positives / tests conducted

Subsequent positive tests? effectively ""negative"" results far positivity rate, far Florida concerned.

And forget professional sports teams (3 football teams, 2 basketball teams) getting tested every day least multiple times per week, also helping water positivity rate. 

Governor DeathSentence really bang job, he? Oh all.

I think it’s way early justify mass hysteria contagious variant haven’t studied much. Especially since impact vaccines. see thread people reactions ignore reality actually know. reason, people try react quickly reacting news headlines, rather research. Except Trump lying, Biden saying experts say. Got drive vaccination 2 days ago. large parking area. everybody park 15 minutes after. Everybody is, countries national healthcare delivering, competing Private profit companies. really matter point? think People come contact people far Minks people definitely large numbers. think ever within 6 feet mink entire life. higher risk mutation runs human animal back human? rubbish argument. excuse OP write factually incorrect edited titles. proof evident universal knowledge. think botched things:

1) Giving half dose, although know later received approval UK proceed

2) Giving different placebos different countries

3) Apparently giving vaccine different intervals. hearing vaccine may 95% effective given 2-3 months, leads question people given vaccine much later trial design. so, many people included cohort?

It ""basically fine"" combine data scientific study controls constant. scientific study, change one variable keep everything else constant. case, means give vaccine vs placebo. cannot give different placebos, different doses, different variables combine data produce results. initial press release claimed vaccine 72% effective combining results two different dosing regimens. botched scientific study. Saying “likely” 1918 flu started America scientifically incorrect. would better saying likely started U.S., China, Vietnam, France. aren’t assumed it, wouldn’t use word likely. walk traffic then? Lol Pretty much. Like want able go bar restaurant worry catching covid. Plenty things also want see change post covid world like working home everything People blind normal weight nowadays. I'm firmly middle overweight BMI yet adults refer ""thin"".

These articles incite horrible conversation say things like underlying conditions person obese every time. Damn problem. expert infectious disease saying anything. would even think he's qualified say anything especially March still know lot virus. - SAGE is. politics decision balance needs economy (which ultimately pays health care), inevitable lockdown fatigue (which social scientists members government ""nudge division"" SAGE) health concerns impact mental health remaining locked inside cases working. 

The UK different problems countries huge international influnce large foreign population (or population strong overseas connections - London third foreign born example). addition even slightly self sufficient food goods. makes shutting borders much much difficult countries. population density much higher countries world. population fatter, ethnic urban Europe (all statistically significant factors Covid spread). also much less compliant population say east Asian counties. 

Where UK world leading testing virus, sequencing virus, together Canada Israel - backing vaccine makers buying almost potential vaccines massive quantities early. 

Where UK poor inconsistant public messaging , rapidly changing criteria (the number times hear people lie ""support bubble"" someone else astonishing example), slow response buying equipment - although seems fixed.

I'm hoping positives outweigh negatives ultimately come stronger faster western countries. nothing else vaccinating population lead rapid recovery also represents long term solution problem. UK first highly urban country (sorry Canada) able test this. “Let’s wait first see bad gets” -America Kelso, spokesman, said some employees don't want deprive a true front-line worker vaccine. holidays may slowing things. And people still skittish safety, even health department staff.

“A lot people don’t want first kid block,” Kelso said.

This insane. people want take start giving others, wait change minds.  think joke people celebrating one greatest achievements human history? mean I’ve admittedly slacked rigorous hand washing sanitizing enough evidence comes saying strain spreads easily surfaces, I’ll get back it. mean deemed unworthy? Can't get medical insurance expensive something? That’s 9/11 family member public position actively denying severity AIDS undermining attempts prevent control it? 

If so, I’m gonna gloat, per se, I’m least gonna sassy Black lady “Mmmhmmm.” first jab 2 weeks ago. I'm booked 2nd 2 weeks time. immune I? percentages confuse me, 50% immune? 90% falling? 50% chance immune now, raising 95% 2nd jab? makes sense, dont understand 50% immune. Washington Post I'm extremely pleased US handling vaccine approval. work Oxford/AZ beginning preliminary data. told quickly trials problematic. Oxford/AZ decided proceed along mess anyway. 

There's already low confidence safety vaccines. Pfizer knew that. Moderna knew that. J&amp;J knew that. That's they're running trials transparently books good publications. 

We're essentially using entire UK challenge trial AZ vaccine (and Pfitzer one untested schedule). I'm curious turn out. Hard beat trial fire vaccine proving. We've already encountered complications reactions vaccines manifest trials that's influencing rollout strategy. Goes show abundance caution default behavior new medicine. leads believe none would happened? Europe saw second wave too. didn’t get financial aid, that’s sets us apart countries. 

I think it’s pretty clear mask use deciding factor community experience outbreak kind. unless everyone using N95s. retail pharmacies Texas got Moderna shipment week. Things going Perfect username Maybe “disproof” appropriate, yes, proof correct term. high school teacher regularly sees kids walking large groups masks social distancing driving home school even hanging together background virtual classes terrifying me. That’s Antietam.  grim milestone. fact *so much* uncertainty people get vaccine, even get list notified, another sign complete collapse federal leadership. holding press conferences sending notifications guidelines. 

Silence guy top busy trying overturn election. important remember Oxford's Global study design different thus results comparable Moderna BioNTech's US trials. Oxford US trial read within month give us comparable numbers logistics issue could solved months vaccine rollout.

The federal many state governments criminally incompetent regard. flu shot rough year. I’ve never arm hurt afterwards time sore hell day. mean, US giving vaccine away free... hit problem right head. lack planning, hoping use crossovers IPs would possible without first working miles red tape.

Should kept Star Trek. military doesn’t routine smallpox vaccination anymore. Totally agree assertion. absolutely correct. military great vector itself. back February early March downplaying virus. Japan Korea implement sort military lockdown all, talking about? True. ask (and one did), cancelled professional athletics season next.

But people actually valued opinion, President Clinton would handled COVID-19 would non-issue US. Poorman, I’m sure Poorman it. Another reason: given many personnel are, places go, things do, *will* get every disease that's caught, simple statistics. 2 million(ish) active duty reserve personnel x 25(ish) preventable diseases = 50 million things worry thanks vaccinations. New strains literally nothing following rules, especially virus infects multiple species hop back forth. 

Once covid infecting humans, never going eradicate earth, new strains mutations inevitable. see happen flu literally every single year. glad hear vaccines, course billions dollars US making way Israel first. Could be. point want wave away like many beginning covid? Calling overreacting alarmist? authorities making light situation thus giving birth deniers ppl say ""..but beginning say something else, changing narrative, trust now"". Covid taught better take precautions overreacting trying downplay anything. receive smallpox vaccine receiving secondary benefits 3rd party disease. 

The disease smallpox vaccine prevents smallpox.

Funny mods thread locked made stickied comments ""no evidence anti-mask!!"" literally photos Twitter he's close contact people without wearing masks... Shameful Exactly, Germany placed orders recently, UK ordered ages ago, vaccines delivered accordance country ordered first, great Germans moment. hope not. I'm sure 1:1 comparison mathematically. definitely time imo wear n95 better plus eye protection everywhere go. won’t work it’s impossible get rid virus that’s widespread like this. simple locking weeks would done flu.

**An increasing number people Belgium developed antibodies coronavirus, strong regional difference Brussels, Wallonia Flanders.**

In total, approximately 14.4% Belgian population display antibodies coronavirus, according study conducted Sciensano collaboration Red Cross published Wednesday.

At regional level, presence antibodies much lower Flanders Wallonia Brussels. Researchers detected antibodies 10% Flemish donors, compared 18% Wallonia even 26% Brussels.

Since start epidemic, Flemish Red Cross sending donor samples Sciensano every two weeks test presence antibodies coronavirus among healthy Belgian population. organization also participated study French-speaking side.

To date, 16,000 samples already tested variety donors.

Since beginning second wave Covid-19 cases, strong increase number blood donors carrying antibodies observed. takes two weeks infection person antibodies blood.

“At beginning March, Flanders, measured antibodies 2% blood donors. proportion rose 5% remained less stable mid-October,” explains Nena Testelmans, spokesperson Flemish Red Cross. “Since then, clear increase, 14.4% end November. probably reflects second wave.

The study may show spread virus, change vaccination strategy people act.

“Just measurable amount antibodies coronavirus blood mean sufficiently protected infection,” Red Cross stresses. “Whether antibodies not, is, therefore, important continue take precautions prevent virus spreading.” lot talk fenofibrate potential treatment, seem fairly confident university conducting trials, much said excepts regular treatment virus couple months, back July initial studies mentioned chance making virus similar common cold. Fingers crossed trial positive they're hoping be. It'd great added recovery trial, we'd get results much quicker. think someone facing long prison term violent crime might okay attacking innocent person try escape. masks work paired measures actually work 1 million day, would hope achieving come March/April, unreasonable hit 70% Autumn. Purchase distribution issue. New Jersey allotted [512,650 doses deployed 46,217 Even huge data lags, that's failure administer vaccines. makes 12 20.

Possibly post replied figuring 5 days week, 7...but know area arw vaccinating Saturdays, wife got Saturday, dont know sundays.

In case, think current rate going hold true insanely stupid. Pretty much sole focus right health care workers. goes public, CVS, Walgreens, target, Walmart etc...will vaccination points, millions people day get it.

Nobody trying to, ever planned peak levels point, wasnt goal. NYC, NY state matter, control much vaccine shipment get. get get, get it. really comparison. Los Angeles densest metro area country. $20 per dose extortionately expensive American used insane drug prices could say otherwise, especially compared Oxford/AZ vaccine $3 dose. 

**That explain USA made Oxford/AZ vaccine larger order American vaccine Trump's called 'Operation Warp Speed'.** rural areas..... Nbc news reports would take 10 years vaccinate us current rate. absolutely getting done right virus still faster us. 83% Americans live urban areas roughly 3% total area country. Amazon deliver anywhere USA within couple days I'm sure government figure something out- rent refrigerated trucks planes, use military, setup distribution hubs 10-20 largest metro areas etc... . Medical transport infrastructure also scale population like using Israeli infrastructure vaccinate 330 million people. 
The incompetence US government frankly developed countries astonishing, vaccine come blue, many months prepare SMH, can't believe I'm even saying Israeli usually government that's super incompetent can't figure anything out. Global Pharmaceutical Industry: production constrained shortage vials.

Reddit: Easy - look Amazon!

Global Pharmaceutical Industry: Wow, gamechanger!!!! Russia, who's proven they'll use never agents middle countries without second thought...?

Dae americuh bad... Durrr Well absolutely happen. vrain understood title saying apologized 19 months ago 🤣 Yes, lucky coincidence (since presumably also variant circulation already, like everywhere else). sample size 0.000053% cases, it’s still representative. Especially given sample size smaller possible variance.

If written academic paper would thrown out. know medicine typical person, considering MD USC. say he's ""cosplaying"".

There many, many people spread misinformation social media unfamiliarity topic. I'm guilty it. I'm sure might too. guy apologized fucking April lol worthy news cycle right now. want people fawning whining celebrities, journalists even write dude Looks like conversion rated wrong. $3-4/dose, two doses puts $6-8/person. guy talking him? Shocking. really, pretty small country population size city. 

Easy get negotiate small vaccine requirement.

Logistically lot easier roll vaccine. Great. officially declare 2020 won.

Get it? 2020... one? ... 2021...

""You cold Jeff, flu"" seem like fewer people wearing mask Minnesota got recent caused cases raise immediately fall? think anyone knows. Even second dose might among 5% people vaccine turned ineffective. 

More importantly see evolution disease particular individual antibodies supposed kicking in. People don’t wear masks aren’t victims. virus enablers can’t pass along breathing room full people. yes it’s vastly different lmao cant say ryat thus subreddit. rewuired delusional assume vaccines going 5 million per day. saddest part article say ER Telemetry nurses ratios went 4 patients 6. Texas, routinely give telemetry nurses 6 patients (I 7 night). pandemic. LOL. country's healthcare system screwed corporate greed. wonder nurses leaving profession droves... Interesting. J&amp;J, uses similar technology, also 2-dose trial parallel 1-dose trial, second dose 8 weeks first - right middle recommended 4-12 week range here. 

Of course, 3 months doses, real question much protection first dose gives. know death rate lately, death rate US since pandemic began 1.7% while. feds refused provide money pay happen.

Could please explain actually mean this. solid articles support articles could.

I done lot research, honestly seems like everyone scared PR backlash vaccinating order overly careful. think ""Disney employee"" article shit caught wildfire exactly poster talking doing. Yes I've seen this, seems similar data previously released say ""it may 95% effective 2-3 months shots"". many people based of? people given shot 2-3 months later? part trial design? Scientific studies supposed follow specific design study exact thing large volume people. can't different things different groups cherry pick data points look best. results entire trial various cohorts set trial design? would say necessarily educated works least hazard reasonable guess came about. Actually good time get life insurance I'm sure underwriting going get tight next year. Also interest rates super low hurt life insurance companies UK needs update figures. No, I'm disgusted terrible pos like exist making pandemic last far, far longer needs to, millions die, think ""funny"" people care show basic common decency fellow humans. Shame you. state challenged fact government can't order vaccines. instead blame manufacturer. many countries vaccinating past 20 odd days? Totally agree. benefits seem undoubted almost though seem think need big actually deserves otherwise win vaccine-sceptics, never likely happen anyway.

If anything confused figures mixed messaging likely result less confidence rather more. thought closer .6% (IFR), skewed heavily toward 65+ think we've known early phase trials could case. Remember trials monkeys tested positive virus lungs, compared placebo groups virus lungs. course that's monkeys, gives us idea could happen humans. Damn must get da ladies aren’t ascared nothin I’m saying fear optional surprised. Doesn’t seem like care anyone. people commented, means developmentally disabled. 9 months prep this... Incompetence around federal govt states leadership. influenced like every tracker underreporting holidays, no? AIDS also communicable disease. pass know it. vastly different. could see going either way. jobs/companies probably let people stay remote, especially way pass costs workers. hand, places still love optics many filled desks possible. almost naming Warpspeed make process go faster, unless put planning infrastructure. stick around 15-20 minutes doctor's office vaccine, flu shot included. Sure, chance anaphylaxis low vaccines, want away medical facility happens. Correct math 424 days. Big difference though

UK orders Moderna vaccines small

USA orders Oxford/AZ vaccine large, largest vaccine order.

The real truth US Government badly mangled process vaccine approval, much like EU, waiting complete data rather working analyse data comes working closely Oxford AZ etc. he's president, squawking going matter.

It fun opinion piece CNN twitter reporters, NPR, WaPo, NYT like hanging every word like now. 1st component Sputnik V 🙄 ....even antibiotics developed immunities took generation. 99% likely. 70% single dose. means results within days. huge doubts vaccine seems like everything need point. isn't. London Airport. Yes agree. factors play covid keeping able bodied workers workforce though. Generous unemployment pay eviction moratoriums could force higher wages. 40% cases LA odds finding 24 random samples would 0.00047%. Military mandatory vaccination less weaponized disease CAN—it vastly reduces cost length common illnesses. Navy much concerned weaponized smallpox, although also worried weaponized smallpox.

Time tell UK reckless acted appropriately fast. idea caught it? You’re disgusted know someone made fun internet? Lol OK, thanks. actually released figures ones presented select audience. 

It's probably true then, although 70%, better 62% still 95% Pfizer vaccine messaging around vaccine awful? Half doses supposedly work better yet approved (why not?), 4 week intervals becoming 12 week ones (again supposedly accidentally, supply problems missed four week interval patients).

You can't blame Americans Europeans wanting take little bit time check things promote kind confidence need time anti-vaxxers seem rise.

Why lead whole 100% non-severe, hospitalizations single dose (half full) seems fairly nailed-on massive deal? But, circumstances later force large populations stay 1 dose, people breed mutation virus resistance vaccine? Mississippi Georgia, yes.  Alabama mask mandate since July. perfect? No. enough? No. least something? Yes.

Our governor (who state nicknamed Meemaw) denier all.

Before mask mandate, maybe 30% pop using public. After, went 80%. Better nothing guess. there's decent chance Pfizer doses left unused expired they're hospitals ultra-cold freezers. Wow basically fill days smug moralizing prick people's 8 hour old internet arguments

You work home, you’re much better position LOT people. wait turn. EU paid less Biontech received 375 Mio € funding. 

This lead EU buying 200m doses roughly 5€ less per dose. also took advantage option buying 100m additional doses. comparison USA bought 100M vaccine normal rate ~20$ later additional 100m ~40$.

There 2 vaccines far larger order volumes (AstraZeneca Novamax) Biontech closely tieing Sanofi Gamaleya. 

Noone could told advance many Covid vaccines would win race. Biontech effective brought fast market. 
Meanwhile vaccines far higher funding order ended lower effectiveness and/or still trial.

**Summary**: 

* Israel prioritized bought vaccine early premium price knowing effectiveness.
* EU paid less subsidized.

Side note: 
Because often see EU criticized ordered Biontech vaccines supposedly receiving less Biontech vaccine USA UK:

Country |	population |	amount Biontech vaccine ordered |	Biontech/population
---|---|---|---
USA |	330 |	200 |	0,606060606
EU |	446 |	300 |	0,67264574
UK |	67,26 |	40 |	0,594707107

The EU worse USA UK. ordered sought vaccine higher volume lower price time noone knew effectiveness readiness market vaccine. 
Pretty much every country binding countracts buying vaccines 5+ different manufacturers order amount varying.

Israel easy time ordering Biontech vaccine premium price country small population. EU made gamble noone could tell vaccine would ""win"" they'd forced take failed vaccine gamble pay off.

The people criticize EU performing worse USA UK ignoring EU started vaccinating slightly later date. 

Sorry rant. constantly comes rant. CNN updates said April emergency authorization US per Slaoui think..... thought would Jan I'm sorry. one thing frustrating me. People care Pandemic really inconsiderate medical professionals like yourself. Gamble home... It’s funny hearing there’s big disconnect people getting vaccine reports news outlets. news can’t keep reality it’s good news indeed case. Wait, 2 100 M&amp;Ms peanut butter instead peanut? I'll homeless then. I’m doubting you, I’d really like see stats long-haul covid scares lot low probability dying virus. links backing 1/3 figure, I’d appreciate it!

You know, long terms effects poverty, depression education ruined.  hope not. saw US plans approve April. Given slow pace vaccine rollout Canada right people riot Health Canada also says approve till April. Lions fan suspect feeling engrained DNA now. Bear mind excellent mRNA vaccine manufactured, delivered administered fast humanly possible. may attempting distribute inferior vaccine would caught bottlenecks around transport medical facilities/personnel, we'd better sticking mRNA vaccines. Early research suggests could opposite^*, previously infected certainly pathogens, like pneumococcal bacteria, induce better immunity natural infection does.

Rip Check December 7th calendar. get it, that's benefit. vaccine probably prevent transmission, even though nobody tested hiw much does. many people around get it, chance catching covid massively reduced. Id live see commentary medical professional parents Agreed. I’ve seen “well reported X amount cases day, math total population take years achieve herd immunity!” It’s like oh naive. don’t think people realize undercounted cases still. Hell personally know people opted stay home 14 days drive appointment, get test, pay it, wait results, deal doctor etc. believe least tens thousands done this. 

That’s counting got don’t know it, especially stupid get refuse get test. know too.  think 'flu-like chances dying' (and dying possibility - could young adult really shit couple weeks lose sense taste smell while), exactly risk taking vaccine? worst reduces risk hospitalisation zero. Neil Ferguson's report UK government last week said new variant increases R 0.4 0.9.

Ireland got R number 0.8 1 first lockdown.

So means new variant seems unstoppable.

Unless Ireland gets vaccine fast, everyone going catch virus. Easter either way: need much faster, aggressive vaccine roll naturally immune.

Perhaps thinking change to: vaccinating older, vulnerable people, health workers teachers, allowing rest 'herd' catch it. Stats show roughly 5 deaths per 100,000 under-70s, would around 220 deaths remaining population, equivalent road deaths. (Long COVID health difficulties would presumably also factored in.)

It case vaccine manufacturers going sell doses planned on, prior new variant. hold-up manufacturing, presumably massively incentivised try produce vaccines faster, otherwise new variant beat it, innoculate population itself. posted switched '79 like Navy seals, etc. people trying solve global pandemic wrote serious comment worried people shitting themselves. shut it?  Apparently 100% people vaccine approved for.

This makes sense. journalist simple calculation without thinking much it. Washington extended restrictions put place November Jan 4 Jan 11, think bad. surge really leveled worried bit XMAS NYE increase numbers big again, really see major surge Thanksgiving hopeful optimistic.

I think long cases go level considerably, going back Phase 2 level restrictions November happy medium good outcome. I'm certainly hoping that. Fair enough.. trying go route. talking scientific implications here. C’MON MODS I've spending lot time looking numbers honestly fun. Denmark already beat us terms per capita vaccination Croatia already vaccinated per capita population. EU approved Pfizer vaccine like week ago European countries quickly take us well even though approved vaccine weeks before. 

Hopefully Canada ramp vaccinations fairly disappointing now. getting done. Well good enough UK, makes sense: UK company, that's strategic thing. know. Yeah, could walk Quebec, grab bootlegger dep home 30 min. least one regulatory agency proper review. asked two questions

Back topic, I'm sad hear news Dawn Wells. Gilligan's Island staple TV rerun youth. Pretty sure I've seen every episode—and several episodes multiple times. TV stations back then. RIP. Yes, figure came something stumbled across recently.

Paying attention offering analysis without considering dynamics? blow balloons? least actually something. Ahh Dr.Drew real doctor, practicing physician still sees patients medical practice, Board Certified Internal Medicine, Board Certified Addiction Medicine. Pinsky also Assistant Clinical Professor Psychiatry Keck USC School Medicine. Blame state.

The federal government clear. responsibilities were:

\-Get vaccines produced fast: CHECK

\-Verify safety vaccines: CHECK

\-Demand states submit reports plans: CHECK

\-Procure vaccines, healthy supply injection kits (100 million start with): CHECK

\-Produce guidance receive vaccine first: CHECK

\-Provide CDC website info vaccine providers: CHECK

\-Provide online portals ordering &amp; reporting: CHECK

\-Deliver states according population, holding reserve second shots: CHECK

&amp;#x200B;

The state's responsibilities get vaccine warehouses endpoints, stick needles arms, report back data. falling flat fucking face.

80% work completed rapidfire pace federal government (the CDC, FDA military.) final 20% is, well, problem. sure calling inferior vaccine accurate. certainly inferior trial AZ didn’t experience running vaccine trials setting multiple trials separate countries obviously challenging. 

One thing know sure nobody received vaccine dose regimen admitted hospital severe COVID. also cheap, easy store transport produced massive scale right now. government worker, could predicted mindless bureaucrats would hurt process

After Holiday season, vaccines ramp up. Even pandemic people's lives literally stake, unionized workers still going take vacations two consistent problems sub:

Give panaceas pass, premature publications.

When CDC said could drive ground wore masks, set alarm bells head sure potentially dangerous messaging-Michael Osterholm’s well (now Biden’s new Covid advisor) premature publication thing. That’s like half content sub. ""Christian"" also think vaccinated meant masks, assholes would claim vaccinated get wear one. There’s easily identifiable way tell someone’s vaccinated they’re walking grocery store— we’re gunna wear masks none us to. support giving older people, state Florida way, I'm worried we'll go back normal soon meaning people stop wearing masks put frontline workers risk. I'm okay continuing teach high school person students coworkers stop wearing masks old people vaccinated. Mary Ann :(

“It’ll look like there’s vaccine sitting shelf it’s actually administered,” Kroll said.

Oh FFS That's entirely false. ""absolutely certain"" (99.999% better) strain responsible current surges places genomic surveillance all. Pathological Contrarian. 

Love it! stay place think larger concern far doses delivered vaccinated, seems cohesive plan resolve discrepancy. literal months plan vaccine roll out, there’s hodge podge local plans. 

In Lee county Florida example telling seniors come wait overnight first come first serve vaccine lines. literal 80 year olds sleeping overnight camping chairs waiting vaccine 6:30am morning gone. fun hunches gut feelings! Let know data stating otherwise. Trump hate here? entire article focused states massive unused stockpiles guess we'll see progress CDC website updates today There’s still danger people run restaurant indoors. guess get ""vaccine infrastructure"" need vaccinate hospitals Long Term Care facilities.

[This seems fairly straight line people up, fill whatever form, give vaccine. CA 300,000 12/28. pace terrible. Association Immunization Managers wrote letter McConnell October asking $8.4 million states workforce, infrastructure, data recording, etc. states get money. analysis smaller portion, know inside portion.

But data smaller portion used extrapolate going inside portion using confidence internals. Even UK, they're sequencing 10% positive tests, insanely high amount. Granted, much larger share pie, extrapolation done every level sequencing.

While know exactly going outside purview, data used make inferences estimates. Trevor offers confidence intervals, example, notes probability rather certainty. Poor guy, RIP. loser idiot! realize answer question OP right? said I’d revile decision like Western country. different cultures different moral codes. value stopping false information panic freedom speech. value collective individual. value Christianity Islam, value Buddhism Christianity. 

Few choices objectively right wrong. merely choose see consequences choices, innocent man detained. see consequences choices, anti-mask, anti-vaccine disinformation undermining health effort. Google it. People seem underestimate much healthcare politically/socially everyone else. Even nurses generally bad breaking restrictions everyone else.

In way also get worst case scenarios someone get allergic reaction paints views  Reinfections would counted labs testing since already tested positive before. 16,380 positives would better look Reinfection happens since includes positive testing 26.29% 62,303 testings 45,923 negatives 16,380 positives.  lot reporting delays, many states data that’s close week old vaccines. not. jailing reporters reporting this. need held accountable least degree. science shows outside dining big danger. still following science? Also would note MHRA staffed Brexit forced EMA relocate outside UK, MHRA poached 1/3rd staff Rarlsbad Caverns? Yeah we're talking several hundred million people gotten disease recovered unknown hundreds millions billions people get ever get vaccinated like world's going hit even 90% vaccination globally. Get real, maybe we'll hit 60 70% we're lucky.

So even care people, that's lot money medical care. 

If look resource game biggest losses time going people get chronic illness tens hundreds millions. 

This effect equalized throughout planet course, poor countries going worse mostly sweep rug, global losses add even they're mostly unseen. all. definitely get vaccine urgency due exposure risk. making 25% healthcare workers, that’s getting education taking advantage opportunity interest roles. Additionally, ICU RN covid unit, tell make cannot explain words stress level coding covid positive patient stretched thin resources, let alone everyday incremental toll pandemic created fellow workers. far comment, feel compadres healthcare field mental health we’ll asked simply walk off, ironically asked go teach patients cope better ailments, treatment plans, lives. 

I care hope make thing unscathed recognized contribution. safe. religion without institutions? million doses Pfizer Moderna March 31, enough vaccinate 100 million people. 

As others pointed wording may unclear, take longer get doses arms, US ready distribution. answer they’re outdoors. People tried hard link crowded outdoor gatherings Trump rallies BLM protests beaches superspeading events evidence overwhelming spread predominately happens indoors. Remember trial is:

1. Made thousands people. chances people practicing strict social distancing isolation slim.

2. Randomized controlled. order prove effectiveness, bunch people Control arm contract virus going daily lives. matter **how** got it--whether partying teaching happened talk infected person. would normally expect two random groups thousands people area would contract virus rate. However, people got vaccine contract virus, say vaccine X% effective. Again, matter whether everyone cautious. fact is, bunch people got virus control arm, vaccine arm. think closer year ago. People working already. pipe dream. people working aware flu mutates, mostly means schools loads students staff isolating pretty much constantly quite time. course will, vaccines summer less transmission way. January possibly early mid February top cases. without next administration, would going down. Stupidity ruins city need coronavirus vaccines long long time yet come, especially we’re using Oxford/AZ one effective. vaccine track released mid 2021 undoubtedly needed. virus mutates rapidly adenovirus technology used Oxford/AZ one ever used once. government already spoken plans implement Imperial vaccine replace Oxford/AZ vaccine

How....is better throughout 2020? 

Maybe you? lot families gatherings  Seems need one component set vaccination sites give everyone anyone shows up. Simultaneously, group targeting elderly health care workers. Since benefit members public getting vaccine, there's argument made vaccinate many people possible fast possible. right? really. places severe booking strain admin staff. done better job, simple like social security able home problem theory novel pathogens terrible form weapon. Sure, cripple entire army, also crippling yourself. Militaries want able conduct targeted attacks enemy combatants, poison whole world. That's whole lot countries signed banning biological weapons outright; least US treaties even apply private citizens. They're useless intended purpose mere existence danger people armies supposed protecting.

(The line-of-thought reason countries bothered nuclear weapons either early realize problems North Korea.) Headline ""Ignorant Anti-masker Dies"". example elected him. According worldometer America exceeded 20 million cases today. rate close 25 million time Biden takes over. Sure. pretty easy evidence likes ignore fit narrative. pretty clear point way lower 70% infection, probably around 40ish%, cases tend burn out. HIT dramatic shift ability virus find new susceptible people. still infections come across much lower rate. basis Farr's Law. see Midwest States (regardless restrictions states saw dramatic drop cases (most time right increase restrictions). position people take restrictions work committing logical fallacy causation correlation.

For reason Fauci wants ignore evidence wants downplay it. assume downplaying evidence push vaccine. okay public health measure also demonstrates lack transparency raises issues people (much like NYT statement weekend) good get arms thier point. Production going decent per reported numbers. Distribution not. Jesus, wish boyfriend could’ve talk back December. Hell, January. would’ve made difference — rather world get torn apart March 13th Keep mind protect oldest controlling COVID sooner, vaccinating people likely get spread COVID, like waiters cashiers. Old people tend catch COVID frequently spread much. Emphasis deliveries here. Warp Speed done good job allocating delivering vaccines (looks like hit 20 million that). However, people actually taking going way slower Can't work dead much cheaper (less $4 remember correctly), stored normal fridge unlike Moderna Pfizer need -70°C . mass vaccination that's huge difference, set vaccination stand cooling box already use flu shots. cost shots, 10 million people vaccinated 60% efficacy prize 2 million vaccinated 90% efficacy easier distribution also faster. Maybe... guessing. federal government reasonable way this. makes sense would provide benefit hospitals always handled stuff.

Can people stop trying blame feds every fucking issue? Sometimes states screwing up. Sometimes hospitals lazy didn’t accurately plan action distribution glad teen ""dumb teenager"" then. 

My kid fine remote learning. hanging friends. take job offer come back holiday season job worked last year- $ year. father heart arrhythmia, saw went thru earlier year Covid. 

I really hate people lump kids one group. kid stupid selfish ass. That's know sub operates? see lot fear long term effects vaccine unknown. founded fear? concerned one really be, why? mean it’s better. FDA much deep process vaccine approval. Even so, Pfizer applied authorisation UK US think expected vaccine ready first. ended bad gamble regretted since. frantically trying buy others turned quicker, better trial results. AZ approved till March, then. source? Natural immunity exist? point. target audience going read headline. Current population 275 million = 550 million doses.

According Bloomberg vaccine tracker prior agreements 225 million doses. Adding new agreement, 325 million doses.

Enough roughly entire 25+ population. pretty ignorant. Flu mutates quite readily many strains makes difficult create universal vaccine. promising candidates probably quite ways away universal flu. fairness, seem unintentionally inoculated everyone.... I've thinking post well. Here's r/bestof it: Put back week exam students 2 normal.

The 'normal' students going back 11th anyway everyone's shifted back one week. 

They least claiming students tested 'regularly' now, whatever means. last couple years, learned easily influenced major sector country is. also learned wearing masks helps slow covid. Leaders need lead, especially constituents morons.  pushing know help pandemic, instead wear mask public supported Trump.  Maybe people get now. Even vaccines approved, current deliveries Moderna Pfizer would see 100 million (29%) Americans vaccinated March 31. one questioning actual analysis saying wrong. I'm virologist, suck statistics, think going essentially know know. analysis smaller portion, know inside portion. idea what's going outside one analyzing 100% every person carrying. people untested, dead, strains may lab. Lol!

Hopefully vaccines don’t expiration dates fucked! Factually untrue, every country vaccine approval system EU. UK could approved vaccine quickly EU. It’s another example ministers spread propaganda lie.

Also article unrelated, Der Spiegel trustworthy people reading unhealthy dont want admit feel you. thought church going great. pastor young passionate afraid talk tough topics. felt slowly becoming prideful himself, sermoms became extreme, also started preaching sappy popular , yet shallow, material. pandemic hit church made fucking news refusing close ""we faith fear"" still refuses enforce masks holding ""family day"" parties well huge indoor Christmas eve service. feel ashamed ever recommended church. feel scammed embarrassed. left never go back. Reading news Sweden's Covid response, double check sure I'm reading Onion. false positive negative Good thing don’t run Moderna report covered /covid19 3 weeks ago good explanations couple users happening. Well worth reading!  day abruptly “temporarily” laid off, work entertainment that’s pretty permanent 

I won’t forget date. think following Monday, boyfriend’s school stopped in-person teaching.

Definitely bittersweet vindication you. - Canada hasn’t even received data packages yet

- AZ hasn’t applied approval EU yet

- US won’t approve April

- UK, India, Chile have/are soon approve vaccine.

In former 3, they’ve heavily based portfolio vaccines. It’s likely weren’t getting deliveries April regulators prioritized vaccines review. That’s probably Canada US approved Moderna quickly. way hell would accept vaccine data published. amazing people like ever blame Trump anything administration did. It’s similarities existing viruses it’s affinity ACE2 receptor humans remarkably specific neighboring species area.

That anomaly specificity receptor happen, it’s true don’t original samples, specific mutation like would astronomically unlikely. think it’s likely cultured reason.

But like said, don’t know, try call like see it. don’t put huge emphasis however. Mainly focusing talking masks. CCP? I'm sure they're already going literally fast can. significant change. necessary wear mask. lot people kind blowing proportion. Nobody rooting new normal forever. feel like easily kick illness ass wearing mask. next upcoming years looking like roaring 20's again. Agree. Also, one quote explaining slow process article infuriates me:

 “A lot people don’t want first kid block,” 

Then find someone else since millions Americans willing get vaccine now. need vaccine shots arms. Even though think would stupid matter done, really frustrating thing that, people would wear masks, probably lead much disease spread all.

The protests summer demonstrated outdoor, masked events even halfhearted attempt physical distancing generally superspreader events.

Of course, people stubborn even that, can't nice things. Attributing difference vaccination rates universal health care profit ridiculous. American hospitals overwhelmed accute nursing shortages affect administering vaccines. Pharmacies like CVS Walgreens problem. Things likely pick bit pharmacies board. AstraZeneca did, testing participants regularly see infected. Moderna Pfizer/BioNTech test participants. 

It won’t take much time figured supported data millions vaccinated. 

No one guarantee vaccinated aren’t carriers simply hasn’t absolutely proven. highly effective vaccines, it’s likely aren’t spreading covid, they’re low rate. need definitive data back up. live area LA mountain. would difficult National Guard secure order enforce stay home order. consider big socal is, realize using national guard enforce orders like putting drops bucket. public refuses follow health department recommendations, much done enforce it. depends entirely upon whether uses powers utilize wartime manufacturing act. Didn’t EU yesterday say AZ provided data? received today sort miscommunication going here? weird definition word science  Well, case would like make sure everything properly tested put everyone including myself. see outside boundaries? National Guard certainly many people trained enough administer shot. could set tents direct traffic safe way. Disaster relief mission. come local communities. 

I'm saying we're running people give doses, options. Lol true America reads headline. Right. interesting hell me, I'm smart enough know there's anything luck. Also Chicago, friends dad passed away Covid month ago..

He 50 years old felt perfectly fine Thanksgiving weekend Sunday night fever.. collapsed nowhere lost consciousness. 

After ambulance made hospital, pronounced dead heart attack. 

A covid test performed day Monday that’s found positive. 

This virus really joke.. :( J&amp;J holy grail. works rhetoric quickly change 'allocating doses' 'we doses, hell vaccinate fast fucking possible?' easily. House churches lot work
And difficult hold together long. Produce wealth consume, chattel, fucking die. Put tents fields too. Parking lots Drive through. new strand popping US? current vaccine work strand? think shut every single indoor business place irrespective precautionary measures 18 months actually would worse impact virus. I'm probably furthest thing someone knows enough transmission comment that, I'll leave experts. said, kind spread around relatively enclosed space, can't imagine 10% exposed repeatedly...so what's special them? segregated specific area, particular demographic, meds, different? 3 weeks.... Transport bottleneck U.S.. actually getting shots peoples arms is.

There one article indicates UPS FedEx problem delivering vaccine told told it.

However real problem plan actually give shots states telling hospitals figure lack coordination, preparation, trained personnel give shots, indication logistics companies problem all.  Republican + Bible thumper + anti mask

Truly worse feel college students right now. Stuck school without anything person many cases, low amounts socializing, you’re likely told go home visit family holidays top it. get FDA US pretty skeptical AZ vaccine, April? Really? First question: probably need second shot, least they'll delay better. likely would milder case gotten first shot. Really, know much yet. while. 

Second question: again, data this, likely big problem. [It easy You’re idiot. didn’t turn extra doses. committee did, didn’t want eggs one basket.

Like hate Trump much half America, refuse lump ignorant hatred sake dislike him. won’t blame things he’s responsible mean located. southern California, really California (I know couple state now), best bet looking online, place like mine Oregon, Washington. Wildlife rehabilitation looking for. straight tell now, least run things are, time split cleaning cages, prepping food. takes good amount experience lot training work animals, vet techs vets handle lot that. needed work, really great get go release, see shenanigans different animals get to. competent administration could far better. state governments MONTHS figure distribution.

There excuse, IMO, inability figure out. pay for, all. state governments showing ineptness one.

Honestly, let Chick-Fil-A figure logistics vaccine distribution. restaurants always efficient, without fail. Private industry usually better government comes efficient solutions issues. Maybe cause China known lie, lot There's adage among hiring managers: A's hire A's B's hire C's. 

Trump epitome this, case like F's hire F minuses. persecution thing makes angry. Apparently they’re persecuting bowling alleys bars hair salons also. directly replying someone else's figure 100 million. claim. point matter many vaccines we've agreed buy can't administer timely manner. Perhaps 10% resistant biological reason. haven’t caught yet. caught never tested positive. don’t get wouldn’t substantially solved lots issues? Pay people stay home. Support small businesses close. coherent national plan place. Sure, COVID would still thing, wouldn’t massive clusterfuck today. Instead bailed large corporations supported wealthy. Lmao imagine downvoting legit question.... Close family member ICU nurse hospital WA (mid-sized city) seeing covid patients -- family member offered vaccination yet. word they've told hospital received vaccine yet, though soon. made world

it's CHEAP (AZ making profit)

can transported normal cold temperatures

US 300M doses reserved.

up 4 month gap second dose (minimum 3 weeks)

(more people could get protection faster)

&amp;#x200B;

once FDA approves change things dramatically.

you literally fill ice chest go day vaccinations.

&amp;#x200B;

not mRNA based. uses adenovirus... (which means kinds factories make it)

&amp;#x200B;

Dr. John Campbell quick video notes:

&amp;#x200B;

Pre-orders EU, 400 million doses UK, 100 million US, 300 million China, 200 million Japan, 120 million Brazil, 100 million Mexico, 77 million Chile, 14,4 million Indonesia, 100 million Australia, 33.6 million Egypt 30 million Argentina 32 million Ecuador 5 million Canada 20 million No, they've reported 24 cases today (according worldometers). see reason believe numbers. Tell mother! Better safe sorry. Israel modern science driven country money spare country run people vested interest supporting people. aren’t bogged way Europe bureaucratic inertia strong herd many different member countries single goal. FDoH claims:

""This percent number people test PCR- antigen-positive first time divided people tested day, excluding people previously tested positive.""

You claim they're differently. Fair enough. crap that's happening state, necessarily put past them, what's source? leaves sore need care keep away people creates scab scab falls own. Like need maintain it.  Probably waiting US. Also note ""day"" Worldometer using GMT zone. article seems based Johns Hopkins University statistics, likely base ""day"" US time zone.

That aside, would expect lag reporting X-mas / NYE period understanding don’t yet data whether someone immune carrier. shouldn’t probably act cautiously quantify risk scientifically. site says 2.3 million numbers Monday Tuesday, think, best case scenario, there's extra 1 million unreported. Passive aggressive death cult want die.  I? someone makes ugly accusation, provide source.

Anyway somebody else provided link. Dr. Fauci said nothing like childish statement written above. kids' daycare staff member that's exposed covid home still coming work. normal since staff would considered critical infrastructure employee? heavy heart today. October 1yo spent two nights hospital due seizure got I'm sad daycare careless horrible experience. lil Nitrogen fall right Germany wasn’t struggling storage distribution, one case weren’t sure 1000 vaccine doses met storage regulations transport. That’s different struggling store them. issue data wasn’t clear don’t know helpful new strain people? rich want customers running around consuming quickly possible That's bring National Guard. Put force behind ban stay-at-home orders. What's wrong brain? Let guess: republican? still don’t know long term effects, mRNA vaccines diseases still take years approval conjecture, based vaccines developed.

The Sinopharm vaccine based weakened version actual Covid19 virus; technique that's used polio viruses.

The Pfizer Moderna vaccines new technology based mRNA, little known long-term effects. kind vaccine used animals, starting past years. AstraZeneca vaccine based chimpanzee adenovirus, moderate advance technology. Janssen, Chinese Cansino, Russian Sputnik-5 vaccines based human adenovirus vector, tech we've using since 1980s. Novovax vaccine is...something else. use insect cells test tube clone coronavirus proteins, another new tech.

Because Sinopharm's vaccine based actual SARS-CoV-2 virus, exposes patient's immune system entire virus instead single protein (as mRNA Novovax methods do), *informed conjecture* provide longer-lasting immunity.

Feel free argue opposite. really, going time us know certain long vaccines give protection. It’s strange me! March 13th day everyone else seemed realize going on. 

It gross feeling bittersweet vindication. kind special pathogens there? age range, “logic” would better suit use automobile. take chance? Sure. giving away money us won’t solve problem root. delay pain. Absolutely tragic.

Right now, issue they’ve sent doses hospitals give medical workers, designed give vaccinations quickly. compounded problem hang around 15 minutes vaccine given need keep careful track vaccinated when, can’t roll hospital giving jabs whoever wants like flu vaccine. I'd call ""non-scientific logical"" fear mongering. Logic would say plausible infectious, virus act faster. Meaning dangerous less viral load. went blood test (ELISA) yesterday I've booked month ago. absolutely symptoms results came back rather surprising. 

IgM: 10.6 
IgA: 2.31
IgG: 4.59

The IgM value cutoff (11) means borderline positive. 

I took rapid swab test home came back negative. 

I recommended take PCR test asap afternoon. results within 48 hours.

I honestly stressed hell, covid bubble, isolating month. place visited local supermarket. 

Does anyone experience positive IgM negative IgG without covid?  None. random death.

Have nice day! Assuming contagious strain. Nice. hope going enough especially Sanofi one failing. doubt holidays increase spread increase positivity. almost year since pandemic begun. know point one-day spikes representative trends. 

It could well back 12 percent tomorrow. think let perfect enemy good comes allocating vaccines. Get people follow general plan. There's sure plenty individual cases people got soon.   long jesus soul Leonard Nimoy.

from [UK government published today: 1 dose gives 53% effectiveness immediately, going 73% wait 22 days after. 2 doses 70% even read article? They’ve done flu trying Covid initial test said worked well. Meanwhile rate US vaccinating, take 10 years. hurt man. hurt real bad. dare state enforce public health orders I'm honestly shocked lack respect people shown healthcare workers-people clapped month back March April thought acceptable substitute wearing mask social distancing. everyone, course, many people. that's even going people whose brains rotted social media youtube refuse accept covid exists all. Yes epidemiological data

No biological data Tier 4 still embarrassingly loose. yobs entitled prats make mockery impunity. Prediction: keeps getting worse everywhere UK including tier 4 areas. fine signed claim use ICU beds infected It’s almost like administration interest actually serving public interest anyone good website tracking vaccination statistics? 


I using bloomberg great im crazy giving ad revenue. Welcome 2021, new fear transmissible variant doesn’t affect vaccines. opinion, far important factor going feasible prove gotten vaccine hasn't. sign door grocery store says ""wear mask vaccinated"", who's gonna check? Everyone want wear mask say vaccinated. far easier continue requiring everyone wear one community spread goes enough.  amazing people still act cute - pretending unlikely prior Covid infection make likely successfully fight future. want endless lockdown. AstraZaneca also screwed trial redo things. They’ll quickly stop giving they’re eating bland food three weeks, even late.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* selfish pigheaded christian idiots. adorable ? So? 48 hours. Probably discussing US. Facts. Even 25-30 years ago mRNA technology Pfizer Moderna vaccines weren’t fleshed out. lucked much coronavirus; could much worse. Abbott Patrick moving CO end 2021. absolutely refuse spend anymore time governed rich assholes care many us die.  prick. Haven’t seen comments yet, article makes clear targeting homeless communities (skid row tent city Echo Park). Pure evil. affirm take solid 12 hours driving get Houston El Paso.. mean, say whatever likes point. UK likely ahead us vaccinations. Whichever point they're able return normal - 10, 20 50% vaccinated, far behind.

We've locked down/restricted form nine months now. time waste. stop deaths country nosedive. personally plan stop US gets 100 deaths/day - point virus turn ""just flu"" wearing mask that. No, rarely went restaurants covid. big impact loss climbing gym.  still order take places used go. still able lovely outdoor dining experience santa Barbara recently. 
I empathize restaurant owners. Truly do. recognize even mandated restrictions I'd keep ass clear environment like that. 
This always missed factor this. People risk afraid disease lock without government intervention. businesses still suffer , even without lockdown. lockdown may make little worse them, pandemics create reactions. People change behavior own. 
Obviously , good percentage ignores risk, hospitals full. friend mine got turned away one recently. need indoor dining?  

Seriously , never ate restaurant again, I'd ok it. world need luxuries much willing risk health loved ones. world war two, ancestors rstion food butter materials defeat nazis. already caused deaths us combat deaths war still accept eat indoors Applebee's? sense patriotism ? one seems willing sacrifice anymore. Ww2 lasted 4 years. even year pansy society can't even sacrifice bare minimum. 

Seems like country full wimps now. FDA ridiculously hesitant approving drugs haven’t tested US. It’s one reasons prescription drug prices high. Especially since Oxford transparency issues won’t approving recently resumed US trials complete. kind formula used determine 11 weeks acceptable, anything less rubber-stamping? wonder much incidental really happen psychotic break first time COVID +. Isolation also great mental health general happened temporary hospitals ICU beds ventilators big cities suffering greatly? It’s selfish, it’s reasonable reaction. I’m honestly loss city could possibly do/thinks work, think nothing result enough public compliance drive cases.  theory yes chances extremely low. Yeah that's fair point, he's total catasrophiser, always worst case. sake others? Yes. sake protection? No, consider bullet proof. Decline fall American empire. mean, soon group represents 99% Covid deaths vaccinated, yes hope it'll re-open speed light switch.

I paused life 9 months save lives, I'm staying locked summer stop 20-somethings getting fevers. Nice dodging question. suppose purposes politics then.. He’s got eating free meal! can’t resist free food Yes. know final 2020 tally we'll actually wait next Monday's update. data collected US trial inadequate kind mess. example, inadequate representation older age groups. know get downvoted oblivion chinese shills saying this, chinas history vaccines horrible doubt one approved europe.

The downvotes prove point tho. Enforcing businesses infinitely easier enforcing private gatherings though. event happened yet, right? arrest asshole? Block access venue/area? \*something\* prevent happening? negligent fumbling current administration's vaccine distribution, MANY people going die suffer. It’s funny think - give someone polio vaccine attenuated virus. Polio far greater chance killing permanently disabling you, they’ll get like it’s nothing. mRNA vaccines aren’t even live dead virus. i'm denier, saying disinformation. know ""permanent"", meaning life-long. sure hope not. Also, vaccine reports delayed 3 days. dunno, friend who's Reddit severely immunocompromised gone (except outside walks wife doctor visits) since March. total introvert dislikes people homebody normally, even ***he*** going stir crazy. says misses irritated stupid people public. noticing child. explains lack foresight. “Secular charities don’t well” also part hypothetical reason: inseparability systemic religious influence. speaking philosophically ideal potential future respect stripping away artificial constructs realizing intrinsically conditioned think external moral authority. Personally really want go back normal. 2 kids 3 even chance enjoy life yet.

Problem see one clear plan getting better.

I keep seeing cases, days lockdown, days masks, vaccine coming fast enough, enough. New variant covid.

I want things normal dunno finish line hope far away.  wait Israel becomes first country reach herd immunity truly reopen, including international borders zero testing quarantine arrival. Israel probably throw huge celebration hundreds thousands people show sure are. Every nation face insane pressure follow suit, including Australia. restart trial US. FDA really annoying.  - yet. time I'm able get it, be.  According King County COVID-19 dashboard, last week King County, 1,015 people experiencing homelessness tested positive COVID-19 since March. 1.7% total King County cases.

Of folks, 17 (1.7% cases) died. similar overall rate King County (1,066 deaths, 1.8% total 60,799 positive cases.) 

Hospitalizations however higher among homeless cases (157 1015 cases, 15.5%) compared county whole (4,100 60,799, 6.7%.) ratio hospitalizations deaths suggests issues disproportionately affect homeless, drug use mental illness, perhaps simple fact people don’t home go isolate, impact healthcare providers’ willingness hospitalize compared population large. Also, it’s likely many cases go untested/undiagnosed among homeless compared population whole, could skew hospitalization numbers.

It notable homeless population demographically “higher risk” - far men women, older general population (fewer children), black indigenous general population. despite indicators higher risk, well presumption folks likelier preexisting conditions less access sanitation, homeless appear relatively well.

Knowing COVID-19 spreads, think homeless definition less opportunity catch spread virus - spend much time outdoors rather homes, workplaces retail stores. homeless see streets often congregate, it’s almost never indoors. fomites stronger route transmission COVID, perhaps (lack of) sanitation among group would problematic, since it’s mostly airborne/droplets, day day life puts less instances transmission likelier. Considering much higher risk homeless people based demographics, environmental factors (that is, physically outdoors often) seem likeliest explanation. Ya’ll got goooood cheese mutha-fuckas! Goddamn covid killed Mary Ann!! Honestly, wish would trust UK go along them. FDA way proud ever that. I’m guessing based social / work circles I’m assuming there’s going massive resource drain it’s over. don’t know MDs know lot PhDs are, every single one, talking least somewhat seriously leaving. Many change minds inertia take vaccine. know four seem like they’re super serious it. 

I’m leaving, myself, can, it’s join relatives abroad. zero idea life like there, least won’t trapped 72 million people who’ve signed name devils book. US's leading expert infectious disease said believes progress made help open US economy March, believes time needed life return pre-pandemic way. 

Nothing new here, folks. Got data many cases transmitted rich people private jets? Meanwhile elephant room: asymptomatic school kids bringing home mommy daddy, classified community transmission cases because, know, test asymptomatic school kids obviously them. Yes. CA model example handling well now. ... *what*?

Who hell acts like people kill you?

I think people smart enough know it’s disease may carry may kill them. Like... don’t know, literally every time flu comes around? People avoid sick people? state responsible plans state. said long ago charge plan. Also keep mind say logistics... holiday month. packages far lost buried deep transportation sector knows reappear. Yes vaccine take priority still time issue. shots - 15minutes per person get including time fill paper work track got it, given certain time followup shot ones available. people take insist waiting since matter safe said 100% issues making people reluctant. I'm hurry mine gladly wait turn months later. Perhaps see results long term testing. think bottleneck getting arms, getting right arms making sure queue jumpers wait turn. Makes perfect sense plenty people gotten others waiting wondering holdup is. real clusterfuck going preexisting conditions - prove disease person giving shots? Sounds simple, trying everyone weeks logistically challenging, say least.

Once open gen pop, though, throughput skyrocket. You’re full shit. Go away troll. slow vaccine rollout going, timeline also changing. CDC updates updates ""allotted"" numbers every Monday soon vaccines leave Pfizer/Moderna warehouses, take 24-48 hours arrive. Based national averages, probably around third doses arrived NJ yesterday today, others week two. That's hospital staff vaccinating hospital staff. going really pick pharmacies, vaccination vans, etc...are involved. feel like, even they're struggling great discomfort, sometimes last hours finally find courage (and tokens) request favorite Chaturbate performer one filthy thing they've always afraid ask for. Well get it. Stop scared quarantine get back. 

Sounds like bitter others enjoying life sit irrationally angry overreacted want backpedal.

Stop shaming others wasting lives. Yeah months. Give break, almost 10. think that's what's going here. Covid tracking project even released article found explaining really matters.... 3400 lot, 3700 lot... numbers bad matter closer the"" correct"" 24 hour mark. expect 3400 numbers come today/tomorrow, 3700. tongue alone perceive salty, sour, sweet, bitter umami. there's substances mess temperature perception (hot spices cool mint).

All ""tastes"" actually smell rather taste. surprising taste well sense smell gone. Apparently second shot pfizer also delayed 3-12 Seems like they're prioritising giving first shot many people possible giving second shot anywhere 3-12 weeks later. point 100 strains variants flu, years circulating ones fatal severe (hospitalizations) others, don’t continuously become less fatal. It’s random, less evolutionary pressure become less fatal cause less severe infection humans. Peanut butter... disagree think fundamentals statements false would never say talking 'dumb shit'. data released may well exist, company saying serious side effects means nothing data available. Also, consider much national pride riding China think likely release negative data.

Until vaccines recognised reliable approver considered safe opinion, opinion shared majority scientists health professionals not? gonna say mandatory overtime new less deadly variant? No, say anything vaccines work future something do. pure guess work doubled on. Checks purse dollar award....  Nah I'm assuming masks. mean that's big cause spread area, people like friend mask careful public, grocery store, basically wherever legally required. think gathering friends family indoors spread anything distancing masks go door. January 14th already thousands infections 

There E. coli outbreaks magnitude, number alone really tell us mode transmission, still trying cover playing mouthpiece denial. 

The reported Chinese authorities said, make mouthpiece. mean, expect? make random properties virus claim Chinese said virus them?

Also, China covered up, blame China. People using scapegoat playing China's hands. stupid people cheering US left WHO, without realizing going China fill vacuum. done around clock? weekend?? I'm concerned rag apply correct usage writing numbers. generally agreed zero nine spelled 10 greater may used numeric format. It’s like doses going anywhere almost certainly happen. Even mistake fares China (which often cancelled airline) rarely less $300-400 due taxes fees airline cannot waive. Ah OK. Well thanks enlightenment. idea small towns rural Arkansas Tennessee sort culture villages Swiss Alps. Good know! US still ahead countries far terms vaccine deployment.  I’d hate imagine world scalpers bought vaccines flip 3-4x cost. Yeah, see. It’s still early tell long immunity hold. hell, I’d take biannually meant bringing end pandemic. Hah. Yesterday one, 10 patients screamed seen threw temper-tantrums wait 2 hours tested. Meanwhile transported patient recommended 3 patients go ED due serious symptoms. (Florida)

I also berated staff trying get many people schedule could - order practitioner - rather attempting answer calls. I'm really exhausted this. US started 1776. Indians killed that. ones killed count murderers - white Europeans - damage reasons. yes white man absolutely know disease, particularly smallpox, ensured Indians exposed based many accounts. 100%. Covid extreme introverts dream, decent portion Reddit. rest slide before, difference greatest scenario vaccine introduced incidence peaks

&amp;#x200B;

I'm epidemiologist, fact LA hospitals treating people fuckng [gift suggest we're somewhat beyond ""incidence peak""

&amp;#x200B;

when rampant.. who's higher risk ***exposure***

the 65 y/o supposed stay home

or 25 y/o working grocery store.

&amp;#x200B;

stopping SPREAD equally Groups considered early vaccination supply limited

Before making official recommendation, ACIP considered four groups possibly recommend early COVID-19 vaccination supply limited:

* Healthcare personnel
* Workers essential critical industries
* People high risk severe COVID-19 illness due underlying medical conditions
* People 65 years older

**Healthcare personnel** continue front line nation’s fight deadly pandemic. providing care might infected virus causes COVID-19, many healthcare personnel high risk exposed getting sick COVID-19. Learn [about importance vaccination healthcare essential critical industries** considered part America’s critical infrastructure, defined [Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agencyexternal Current data show many workers increased risk getting COVID-19. Early vaccine access critical protect also maintain essential services provide U.S. communities.

**People certain** [underlying medical increased risk severe COVID-19 illness, regardless age. Severe illness means person COVID-19 may require hospitalization, intensive care, ventilator help breathe, may even die. Early vaccine access critical ensuring health safety population disproportionately affected COVID-19.

**Among adults, risk severe illness death COVID-19 increases age, with** [**older highest risk.** Early vaccine access critical help protect population disproportionately affected COVID-19. Sometimes labs.  really hope continue work home. miss office commute all. also miss stress comes going traffic, snow storms, rain, etc.   Sure, wasn’t discussion about. whether calling someone bad behavior “speaking them”, isn’t. got PS5 3080, consider buying lottery ticket luck! wasn’t fat all. Watch video, cover picture. sub 30 reported cases day whole china seem plausible? April long. Especially trial ends Feb. J&amp;J can’t get approved Feb holds true large vaccine shortage early 2021. Sorry thinking different country. correct mask compliance there. 

I still fundamentally believe comparing one small country country scope size erroneous comparison, though.  virus follows every customer door. SMDH! People don’t understand basic physics stagnant air indoors. Honestly fucking hate say I've thrown towel 100% reality situation.

I'm Canada amount people see giving shit anymore insane. misinformation there, anti-maskers / anti-lockdown protests, general mixed messaging government here, people completely thrown caution wind. 

Everywhere look - parks, social media, stores - packed people, distancing, wearing masks. People partying friends.

It's enough countries like New Zealand South Korea shown methods work beat thing back played ball, enough medical community pleading people. 

If fucking figured 9 months start. Follow bar/venue Syd., Aus Instagram. saw little jazz band shows customers. Looked exactly like photo '19. pleasantly surprised. 

I want tell guy like, weird dystopic predictions future already true *during pandemic*. vaccines become commonplace? Forget dude. 

Read article today interviewing sociologist predicts another ""roaring 20's"" post COVID. Seems likely. n= ¿?¿?¿ Better get bot ready checkout. Coming Amazon Walmart.com soon! That’s herd mentality ya Fellow New Mexican. looking forward next months. yet anyone reliably predict significant earthquakes. (Insignificant earthquakes &lt;3.0 happen often West Coast would easy point take credit.) Even earthquake swarms uncommon. Okay entire point host problems aren’t death associated virus don’t seem able grasp that. 

Do understand death isn’t effect virus?

Edit: you’re literally denying thread issues virus causes. unlikely people vaccinated spread virus. I've seen evidence *can* spread virus. flawed face. aggregated trials different countries different placebos, still big enough, safety incident one likes reach significant numbers older adults. Plus weirdness dosing schedule even tested trial. People realize things open doesn’t mean go, right? you’re comfortable going, don’t. 

Exactly. act like someone's putting gun head forcing this? like pulling thin air. Gottlieb let cat bag way back early July saying 

*“This January one way other,” said “Squawk Box.” “Either we’ll get vaccine we’ll spread enough it’s going stop spreading efficiently, short period time get changed mind think wrong.

Edited add, look case curves. XMas holiday messes looks like cases rolling over.  Oh, well data obviously shows safe provides immunity lasts least 3 months delaying booster 3 months problem given circumstances appears sensible thing Yeah I’m sure situation EU, Canada deals 400 million doses Pfizer, Moderna, AZ, J&amp;J, Novavax, GSK, Medicago, we’re covered without AZ. example, believe Pfizer Moderna alone get us around 60% vaccinated July. „many incarcerated people Alaska pretrial, means charged crime convicted.“
Thank America 😢 Yeah one mine want return person.
Lol seriously?
Edit get kids going stir crazy, person I'd preferred, IMHO life ultimate preference limitation supply. Israel vaccinating significantly faster expected, pace run vaccines couple weeks. They're keeping supply second shot everyone who's received first shot, even though we're due like 5mil shots mid january, that's 2.5mil people vaccinated. current rates we'll get little 2 weeks, we'll vaccines give. Israel trying get pfizer moderna move us distribution schedule. PhD STEM. know. Commercial real-estate thing past. Anything else neutral even good simple acts hygiene personal space. that, new normal means increased suicides, overdoses, wealth disparity homelessness due mishandling hubris knee jerk response virus.

Fauci like bad end history books. logistical issue, really. ramp production enough, might end situation tons people need second dose enough got many people first dose. means back normality late 2021 even early 2022 Yeah saw vaccine taskforce many vaccines we've received verses administered we've given 17% far. Since coming every week Jan really need pick pace. kind dumbshit this? vaccine's supply extremely scarce. like daughter died people refused vaccine. Anti-vaxx nuts, I'm taking soon can, maybe look certain groups hold vaccine mistrust US accept data used get UK approval. many problems it, big enough, elderly population significant.

It take time get acceptable data US. like people believe syphilis works way too, really goes nervous system makes insane. anything lower population make harder vaccinate people. many hospitals, nurses, pharmacies, etc. yet given 10% population. US messing around distribution particular prioritizing it. national guard setting-up drive-through testing sites running 24 hours/day 7 days week. still want prioritize it, say people 65 odd number driver's license zip code show tomorrow noon, on. standby list enough people show time slot whoever next line gets it. thought plan typed, I'm sure vastly improved. limiting factor production vaccine, administering (which currently case). College towns areas refer mean rural shit hole. areas devoid 95% good jobs. “New untested”

Tell hundred thousands phase 1,2, and3 clinical trial volunteers would like word her. read challenge also people refusing vaccine opened vaccines short shelf life careful open many otherwise waste doses. example healthcare workers Texas refusing high rate even non healthcare workers contacted get extra doses, aren’t careful doses could wasted then.  Nope closed New Years closed weekends Haha said exact thing stupid thread yesterday, fearmongering outrageous Cool. Like give shit say. people 30, statistically, death rates like flu. That's CDC homes. I'm anti mask nut job. buy fear hype. left house 5 days kids, fyi - follow advice experts, random people reddit sorry. start popping bullshit, check yourself. much less 6 months. like idea. Like said - point keeps changing. seem given making point content say point isn’t, seems... pointless.

Like said, suspended downvoted - hope spoken concerns put context. Makes sense. China + numbers = keep scrolling Thank you! That’s it? exactly antivaxxers want. hate saying prob either actually mentally ill pandemic detached society. That’s even like normal thought singer sent prison. Incredibly dangerous, reckless, certainly going responsible many deaths goes ahead. co workers constantly, clientele job. :( wish would least warn person first. right, nasty. real word, tittypimplehole basically said Ugh. heaviness spirit, reading this. People get hooked hype. emotionality. ego pride blind. guy reminds people thought dancing around snakes drinking poison glorious, God-glorifying. Sad. fundamentalist hypocrite Christian we're talking about...those things dont' factor in. coincidence we've talk religious nutjobs causing many problems COVID super-spreading. people 30, statistically, death rate like flu. long lasting issues interesting hopefully anomolies people preexisting conditions... I've seen anecdotal evidence scientific studies cases mass scale. saying happen ... I'm anti mask nut job... buy fear hype without proper evidence. left house 5 days kids, fyi - follow advice experts, random people reddit sorry. Oh hell no. exposed ie someone house it? someone house exposed? Either way that’s irresponsible I’d send child appropriate quarantine negative test. Exactly, Jesus provide instead hospitals isn’t true all. Many people fine lockdown. It’s close “universally detrimental.” That’s without including massive benefit health care collapse lessening trauma health care workers. feels like heart breaks every day. people lost? confused? public health disregarded? people abandoned? power structures play common theme sounds like ‘I don’t care’. loudest voice sounds like Apathy Empathy regularly call announce itself, rather diligent peace silence. 

Well, don’t care broken heart. care safety well-being, absolutely certain one. care don’t often say so. care message resonate easily amidst apathy. it. Even whales singing.

Practicality data. 

If trials flawed AZ would submitted results FDA European regulators approval. 

They didn’t, knew wouldn’t accepted. not, even 80+ much higher chance beating it. Absolutely possible. Chinese cities incredibly dense perfect environment super spreading happen. surprised already circulated months first super spreader event (Wuhan market). new varient cause deaths? (&lt; question.) Maybe you’re downvoted literally works. Perhaps open mind possibility downvotes don’t always mean “unpopular.” also possibility you’re wrong. different shot ones given US right now. It’s Oxford one. You’re supposed wait 12 weeks one. Getting mine today! I’m pretty excited Mega Churches businesses giving people something want exchange money, like every business. 
It’s great business get into, especially tax benefits. California. I'm office worker works hospital department started getting offered us yesterday; expecting us wait get general public. got first dose yesterday afternoon! far, side effects aside sore arm. No, too. minister health said vaccination campaign depends j&amp;j’s vaccine one no, you’re going continue reductionist spread misinformation. fucking moron. basement basically bedroom bathroom. We’re living movie swear. Thanks, makes sense. What? Please don’t confuse “common knowledge” “conspiracy theories.” super volcano multi-year disaster. Caring immediately injured would acute issue (though megacities near YS) mass starvation later make immediate fatality count look paltry, would make entire COVID pandemic look paltry. :( exactly point? British pride?

Just keep producing pfizer vaccine. RIP Jesus Christ dumbass. reason answering questions? least elderly vaccinated. Death isn’t bad outcome. Plus vaccines here, wait months save lives illness?

Doesn’t Ireland gib financial support people working due lockdown? kind biking this? I'm talking like 50 mile rides times week significant hills.

I could get ride, make huge hill climb long breaks without feeling like coyotes gnawing legs off. cause surge LA family gatherings people generally giving shit virus anymore. wait NYE. we're gonna like 500,000 cases day. means they're going get rid stupid 14 day quarantine rule right? Otherwise completely pointless. Yeah well. Easy avoid popping positive know general testing schedule. figures negligible grand scheme. Best response comment. People saying said like flu ridiculous. I'm talking death rates young people. I've heard 20% people long lasting issues. Would interesting see breaks age range. infamous ""Holiday pause""

Got Moderna going today though think hopefully process goes way better Thank Republican near you.

""It gone Easter. Democrats new hoax"" - Donald Trump  want weekly d&amp;d group back. Except right easiest. vaccines hospital, people already hospital. opposed get people place vaccine already there. there's significant part population simply run. all. 'no plan survives contact enemy.' - Helmuth von Moltke Elder surprise, local federal governments little curb spread COVID, COVID spreads. simple lesson somehow can't get thick skulls average Americans.  Impulse engines ain't looking good either. Read again. young people, statistically, according CDC, death rates negligable 30 compared flu. Go research Thank Republican near you.

""It gone Easter. Democrats new hoax"" - Donald Trump  Vaccinated individuals still need wear masks practice social distancing, don’t yet know vaccine provides sterilizing immunity- is, don’t know prevents someone contagious others contract virus. know prevents serious illness it’s still possible vaccinated person could become infected, experience mild (or no) symptoms, still infect others, including yet vaccinated individuals. large proportion society vaccinated, everyone need remain vigilant Fully agree. 100% serious illness important fact easiest communicate.

Also comparing efficacy need know calculated. much testing done asymptomatic cases trial? US government doesn’t care *the uninsured* I’ve incredibly cautious throughout, ramifications horrendous governor? bullshitting, US buy billion doses,

Um did.... 

[J&amp;J 100m 300m 100m 100m 100m 100m extra doses 100m 100m extra doses math suggests 1billion doses. forget 300k doses Ely lilly 300k doses Regeneron. that's numbers! Spitballing numbers based quick glance CDC website... .2% coronavirus .02 flu people aged 40. types differences risks like minimal compared car crashes so, yeah. I'll follow advice experts (currently stayed home, nut job) buy fear hype, sorry. I'll protect vulnerable anti-mask, traveling asshole tho.  I’ve read masks still encouraged vaccine it’s doubtful vaccine protects spreading covid. things might require proof vaccine, don’t know.  understand community spread? going people help spread virus people, means containing virus much harder.

Edit add: factor new highly contagious variant, it’s incredibly irresponsible now. actually think fine. still manufacturing then. means day 1 market flooded - literally tens millions. J&amp;J approved then, means early April latest time general availability (I assume AZ approved, question dosage/timing). course actually getting arms quickly becoming real bottleneck. completely shocking people Arms blaming actual people blame abysmal situation, Republican leadership Robin Young Justice would say YES! people toxic Coronavirus. Juan de Fuca issue SoCal since fault starts Mendocino heads north there. sure, bad time natural disasters anywhere metropolis like LA hospital rooms historic event. own, increases mortality rate disease care limited, supplies rationed, medical staff hit physical human limitations. Ehhh tbf, lot anti-lockdown Trump supporting idiots sub think know science post misleading information virus. Fewer people vaccinate every day! Testing negative steroids ≠ using steroids. myriad ways get past tests. according article.  ""Parents said health issues.""

Not buying that. Spoiler alert: strain probably while. That's f****** weird used bike 6 miles way work back 5 days week stopped couple months started feel better worse, felt exactly sme I'm sure understand EU works. EU ordering vaccines coordinating massive vaccine effort, countries therefore need heard many different places. Think EU like job union except larger scale. person within jobs union makes decisions, buys house, drives car, there's greater human threat everyone coordinate response. Like enforcing standard charging cable phones consistent GDPA law avoid little tricks get round believe people delegate pay job, proper knowledge, see approve honestly think matter, ppl would discount videos fake. Everything conspiracy days.  Epidemiologists normal humans. care less does. I'm fucking lmfao. think lot people sub introverts didn’t socialize much pandemic, social distancing hasn’t hard rest us much accepting “new normal” EU gets AZ vaccine April stay locked coming months. Nah, sign San Diego samples far. I’m sure turn soon though holiday.

The current surge California direct result shitty state government residents officially stopped giving shit virus. ridiculous statement. Right certain qualifications get vaccinated (mostly healthcare workers), go hospital. limit right getting people chair people vaccinate them. every pharmacy vaccines anybody walk in, throughput much, much higher now. Yup yesterday. wait 10-15 mins. live bay area. One thing weary symptoms after. Yesterday felt fine. Today feels like im verge sick im sick. Hella sore, hella tired. general public going calling alot. really ""day"" 24hr period set at. 

Which annoying long run matched everything sources matter day occurred similar numbers day. Except Germany. think need prevent potential death deciding poor people get work not. person conveniently going talk literal dozens super spreader events president United States Republican party held Fingerpointing 👉 ensued  👈 👉 [Everyone disliked that] work call morning folks Israel- working waiting room, getting shots call, lol. 
I really know going seeing article makes sense now. goes 2021 rate reason might need another covid vaccine 2 years due mutation mRNA tech. can't see injecting remnants sars2 cell produce fragments remnants would significant difference long immunity would last. data dont yet I'm sure mechanism would make mRNA ones temporary. infer lot things, mean going born reality. know protocol works, anything different taking gamble less. Let guess, conveniently going talk literal dozens super spreader events president United States Republican party held?


Not gonna mention huh? people 30, statistically, like flu. I'm anti mask nut job. buy fear hype. left house 5 days kids, fyi - follow advice experts, random people reddit sorry. start popping bullshit, check yourself. concept called passage. Experts also told us masks necessary beginning. said US? I've seen people saying even bother sequencing probably along. Oh, well mean sound way. ""I liked math classes college still sort hobby me?"" almost percentage positivity reliable indicator! /s Would pull crocodile though? Absolutely not, not. absolutely not. report claims 1 dose + 22 days wait fact 73% effective, appears simply rounded 70% article

2 doses 70% effective, 1 dose wait time 53% used work Walgreens got vaccination there. developed soreness couple swollen lymph nodes. told pharmacist next day experienced looked like two heads said she’d never heard thing happening. 

I truly hope CVS Walgreens create plan keeps people safe also addresses individual concerns. Scotland Wales reporting days today. realize that. 

Worked psych floor. Flu bad patients came ICU totally dependent completely different people physically recovering flu 

*Geriatric psych flu patients closer 40 80 

I ""just flu"" phrase wear mask religiously, change fact asshole right now. Bring flamer.. HEAVY FLAMER Trump presided fastest vaccine development ever(previous record 4 years top head) fastest, comprehensive vaccination plan human history. can't see that, bias clouding judgement. see, NY hasn’t either. disputing that. Laschet Söder profit quick rollout, aside Spahn. doesn’t stop transmission, get spot everyone access vaccine, return normal, COVID becomes endemic disease occasional flare ups spread areas low vaccination rates. misunderstand; whole back forth knowing looking way attempting explain looking it. didn’t say stay home 100% time never leave house. leave house go work. Lots people to. don’t go mass gatherings people avoid easily. Like Disney universal studios middle deadly pandemic.

Mitch McConnell doesn’t care die definitely clear. Others want help. Also inventor PCR test said knows nothing body lol.. ya.. that's thing. must live Orange County, CA! pb shot? idiot got PPP money ""manufacturing"". Manufacturing exactly? He's constantly got several GoFundMes going once. He's grifter fraud. virus much disruption been. mans weight doesn’t necessarily anything severity symptoms.

Except stats overweight conditions exacerbate issues exactly medical professionals talk facing severe symptoms even death despite health.

Correct, much higher numbers health already compromised... like every medical institution medical apparatus putting since fact locally known young athlete hometown succumbed virus. sad news. 

The statistical significance one person regard relatively nil mean uncommon given numbers people aren’t worth less they’re overweight.

They worth less cost more. less productive work, bigger drain medical system, produce waste consume general. 

Not worthless, costly. received flu shot work drive through. moved car shot parking lot 15 minutes passed. Seems like could done covid too. VA nurse quits fifteen people vying take place, even takes little roll HR. competition government jobs joke. ones quit hook contractor end VAMC CBOC anyway, contractor find much easier fire replace become around corner VA hospital Cline worked, families huddled maskless gabbed heaps pasta local Olive Garden.

Why article? family members supposed wear masks other's presence? supposed wear masks eating? There's weird sort elitism pointing *those people* flyover country eat *Olive Garden* even wear masks. Elitism lack self-awareness, given readiness actual elite (this guy lives near them) shed masks crowd non-family members think cameras nearby. need quit asking case counts deaths start consistently going down. They're still going up. start seeing sustained drop, easier give proper answer....  Yeah could see real hold up. offer people incredible pay work 12 hour shifts.

I mean understate important vaccines shot arm. hard do. Make offers nursing PHD students come get experience pay vaccinate people. agree. effective immunisation better immunistation even 70%.  
However still want raise 70% 90% 95+%. 

UK population 66.65 mio. already ordered Biontech/Pfizer 40 Mio. ordered AstraZeneca 100 Mio. ordered total 357 million doses 7 different vaccine manufacturers. 

The question arises many willing vaccinate ""lesser"" product? 
It better everyone vaccinates fast possible people take ""lesser"" product vaccinate effective vaccine. 

Also AstraZeneca vaccine potential complication mRNA vaccine.

It useful short-term vaccine better vaccine. wonder sell public without causing distrust.  

In long run become useless since effective vaccines become cheaper vaccines logistic problem also cost money. People want subject 4 times needle etc.  
Well except AstraZeneca brings new formula market higher effectiveness means another trial phase explains US waits April approving it.

Don't get wrong. I'd personally take vaccine vaccine herd immunity something everyone participate in. Supposedly much 2m doses per week plant UK, actually use much. Unfortunately RN, BSN even MD education eliminate possibility complete morons comes vaccines. Yeah, doubt that! . I'm putting perspective slow is. “activists” mean pretty much majority Americans yes, fear series super spreader events Sounds rare covid deaths age group Looks like California added deaths yesterday (now 430) making yesterday deadliest day pandemic 3,723 deaths according worldometers. That’s happened. Elderly essential workers (does include healthcare workers) iq test, steroid test. easy pass steroid test know going happen. also hope understand you’re talking comment. want us everyday normal people make drastic changes like changing living situation, work school commutes, drop hat won’t pressure companies supply cars ultimately affect local government transportation available us? want know solution everyday folk since you’re darn tired us takes. want know putting money mouth lol regional grocery chain area said authorized covid vaccinations &amp; buying freezers, ppe, training now. wonder one bottlenecks current vaccines need lower normal freezers everyone scrambling buy them. really hope less delicate vaccines prove least slowing around world. means probably pretty significant lag time delivery date vaccination date reported (i.e, date delivered definition actually 1-2 days ahead, providers administer vaccine record, submit data cdc whatever frequency). perfectly plausible we're actually moving slow appears---the data timing issue. Good luck. genuinely hope done. Look post history lol. They’re troll. barefoot, big difference premium store brand shoe? Definitely hated us locals. many violent criminals aren’t death row, especially CA bizarre Bloomberg ahead CDC tally using publicly released data many states even updated week misunderstand then.

I articulating real world secular charities well. Universal also ""around"" 35% looks like big issue Universal getting big rush morning people try get limit. So, crowd spreads back park, effective crowd size larger less safe.

I guess since Disney requiring reserve park date right now, panic rush rope drop. Everything bigger Texas, including patient load! xmas new year cases sends regards. Dad? plan 1 million week, least 2 million week realistically needed especially considering 2 doses. 1 million week we’re looking 40 weeks 20 million full vaccines there’s 20 million government’s higher risk groups.

This government get told scientists need lockdown wait weeks actually taking advice given previously. said able reduce regular examination rolling review parallel examination teams. 

The EMA possibility emergency approval, conditional approval provides greater thoroughness waive manufacturer's liability UK US. large chunk government functionaries take extended vacation time Christmas thru New Years period. sure hope take different approach ""send hospitals let sit it.""

This one administered *en masse* national guard. based One first crushes. RIP think every boy crush Marianne It’s odd feel jealous restrictions am. American nothing federal level city different. wonder wouldn’t feel safer, much less staunch disease thing. unreasonable 

If she’s negative, yes want talk it, ok? Yes, get this. Anyone past virus past months least partial immunity.

I know exact data extent immune?  say religion root evil. establish better others - one else's lives ideas matter. Vaccine studies shown even first dose missing recommended second dose leads still leads much better outcomes. numbers/statistical basis, even millions miss second dose hospitals far better vaccination took place.  don’t know correct? Man, 2020 keeps taking. respect please. hopefully dont mean 2021 like 2020 Literally one would break tradition lol   100 percent. adding capacity likely cost quite bit per dose, might late. US diverse population FDA wants trials include age groups also races ethnicities per US census. Honestly though, make much sense, anyone seriously believe need Hispanic group trial? people speaking Spanish make react differently vaccine? get bunch atheists praise events helping destroy christianity killing fake Christian's know what's cringey? Saying cringe every thread visit, like sort edgelord. People think downvoting facts makes facts. say nay Hogmanay administered like 50k shots, fucked work casino, going criminal, somehow isn't. hundreds cases last 7 months. hired lab testing every week, yet nobody gets contact tracing calls. get test outside work live, get call within day two. But, accept outside testing excuse miss work, little motivation get tests. 60 people right now, people working 7 days, working 12 - 14 hour shifts. running promotions get people door, bringing people LA county EVERY day, indoor dining promotions hundreds, live music, name it. told great job providing safe place community come get stress relief, outbreaks here. mRNA vaccines stored -70 degrees Celsius. Given developing countries arid, hot climates, significant degree refrigeration would required vaccine. It’s challenge developed countries use mRNA vaccines - US, UK, EU etc perfectly well. Latin America using Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine currently they’re fine rollout, mostly developing countries. need this. heard friend they’re skipping vaccine bad you. WTF? Repetition make little funnier. guess it’s added effort 

* Stay home 14 days last contact person COVID-19.
* Watch fever (100.4◦F), cough, shortness breath, [other COVID-19
* possible, stay away others, especially people [higher getting sick COVID-19 Gotta make money stay home. Sadly government failed solving problem. 2011 Vanderbilt Medical Center held world record number flu vaccines given 8 hour time period. 

They vaccinated 12,850 people. 

They rotating staff 44 nurses pool 138 people. setup take account social distancing needs cold storage vaccines. I'm talking fall feel uncomfortable going theatre going restaurant normal capacity, watch athletic event

He said ' I'm talking fall feel uncomfortable going theatre going restaurant normal capacity, watch athletic event'. mean normal. Close degree think means still monitoring, international travel still complex 2019 exc. mean exponential? probably double (though knows, way FL hides data) indicate pretty serious problem. I'm surprised DeSantis allowed number released. live AL, work nurse GA (on state border), 100% confirm fault.

In times find necessary go store, wish footage every. single. patron wearing mask despite mandate sign outside. Employees without masks. church every corner masks required.

It's defeating find here. want shake them. Nothing makes difference. spread people. It’s personal risk. wonder greater effort expanding holiday season multiple months soften Thanksgiving - Christmas surge. example, could encouraged people celebrate holidays November, January, &amp; February instead traditional Thanksgiving - Christmas season. People would likely comply way instead cancelling holidays outright. Ugh prompted look worldometers graph

The cases still straight up, exponential growth. hope turns soon. see curve top. looks horrible. rest peace True, though they’ve also received less 100k doses date. Could much better job using doses, it’s impossible get 100k total simply don’t doses yet. also isn’t lack ordered vaccines since Canada vaccines per capita ordered. problem idea mortality rates go up, specially ICU. question going live that? schools closed. Lead directly losing gem, many thousands follow? Wow it’s almost like rolling vaccine hard process every level supply chain stay patient. live certain districts (where bars are).

they close kitchen. cook outside.

they want drunks inside fucking shit up.

food trucks without truck downvoted this? Ahh think right. B. know handle this. found friend get covid vaccine today works healthcare, want to, probably won't. 

I would literally crawl hands knees two miles pay $500 vaccine like ""meh"".  I’m generally concerned, don’t know why. I’m Paramedic Florida got offer get Moderna vaccine either later today tomorrow. I’ve done research I’m absolutely convinced vaccine safe, corners cut process testing, I’m anti-vaxxer way. still almost nerve wrecking feeling gut “what if..” even though trust science. anybody else position feel way? Maybe I’m venting idk. 

Edit: I’m asking opinions. Y’all don’t downvote comment make hidden. It’s open discussion.

Either cause dismissal (phrased nicer, reasons) Canadian here, Federal Govt bullshit btw.

Our border controls bit shitshow. government seems content dole press releases rarely match reality ground.

The Premieres hammering feds international travellers months, latest 'look, look, we're stuff!!' press release another sent embarrassment. Ask anyone flying Toronto, tell screening non-existent even social distancing rules enforced.

They still holding 'pilot projects' see testing airports make difference 1 year pandemic. Well that’s regulator do. However, yes I’m sure AZ/Oxford publish rest data peer reviewed journal trials completed allowing others review critique. one far, they’ve issues trials, may also review well (likely part due errors) Fortunately, parents able suit PPE bedside hold hand passed. still tragedy. Unfortunately matter hard try pin actually failure medical, private, state, lower federal level. him. literally nothing vaccine rolling out. seething hatred blinds makes seem dumb.

But yea, part pathological liar incompetent. Operation ""The clutch stuck"" ...That official Face Eating Leopard Party doctrine, not?  coming him. Agreed delays ideally happening, although think surprising issues national rollout multiple vaccines different approval distribution timelines. Nope rare things rare. Absolutely. I've thought circumstances lot COVID patients; able loved ones comfort end. terrible. teens still ""we're invincible!!!"" feeling, telling mom going OK, totally hear kids. (We *did* COVID past September, lucky ones made OK, worry worst). Without corresponding data point to, They’re saying “please don’t short stock” terms second question well always going risk especially global pandemic. given immunity first shot imagine get infected would minor symptoms severe symptoms assuming get infected immediately vaccinated. Since takes think 10 days vaccine start taking effect could still get severe symptoms say contract covid day getting first shot. imagine would self isolate till better may mean delaying second shot. They've *ordered* enough. physically all. That's mortality rate flu averaged across age groups. 

And includes shit ton old people 

The mortality rate age group flu way way lower still. Old capacity limits new capacity limits? work 40% people opted get vaccine, included.  talking another person decision take reason “there 4 cases Bell’s palsy testing.”  

Yes, one trials show 4 cases Bell’s palsy.  20,000 people. could thing happened.  even cause, likely wasn’t, that’s 4:20,000 1:5,000 still better odds covid. EMA released statement today saying last data package received 21st December, insufficient approval. I'm genuinely confused going AstraZeneca. Yup sounds like something Caesar would say.. First N=26 study.  

Second, [one gone record say misinterpreted. “‘My gosh, found myocarditis, there’s way play,’ ” Daniels said general reaction. “They’re putting saying it’s safe play. They’re reading article. they’re reading it, they’re putting spin it, like, ‘It’s actually opposite. We’re saying actually found this, know path say it’s safe go back opposed uncomfortable feeling knowing anything” actual risk.

Looks like someone needed old panicky headline. Good point clearly wants rolled fast possible.

He says wants lot things bungles actively works prevent. He's incompetent, pathological makes ignorant, ideology dangerous. need able understand blame lay not. start damn people everything do, even didn’t something wrong, completely erode legitimate positions might have.

This good sign! forgot 10 ones cause debilitating long term symptoms.  Look countries like Australia China. scrambling administer vaccine managed control spread covid lockdowns, mask wearing, social distancing. allows countries cautious administering vaccine. 

We that, rather rushing injection vaccine. He's get much closer God. wish well journey. thank Yes, clarifies individuals Hong Kong, Macau China considered foreigners too. title non-nationals. thought Germany needs approval EMA? 70% recipients - 70% COVID positive recipients vaccine. get COVID vaccinated would subset data sample thus different % chance getting symptoms. article...

However ""underlying conditions"" actually common. Prevalence Diabetes people 18 years 8.5%. Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel said 1/3 population risk. push lot big pharma drugs Love line maybe never fully recovered released early truest body falling apart again?  sucks, regardless politics. Remote work programs/culture competitive recruiting advantage attract best people. companies demanding old school person office presence get left overs. believe things Russia conspiracy theorists believe vaccines Western countries? I’ve posted before, hospitals right begging staff get vaccinated small percentage willing get shot. depends greatly hospital/state problem hospital admin sitting shots people refusing get shot. It’s opposite Stanford experienced.

My hospital released official stats ~1300 4000 staff willing get vaccine (and everyone wanted already vaccinated!) begging rest staff get shot offering gift cards incentives. go back second shot 1/7.

And it’s unique facility based I’ve heard peers hospitals area. Staff afraid vaccine. don’t know there’s easy solution.   feel sorry two young children raised without father stupid recognize risks pandemic. nothing else, main point contact seen many places small doors people enter exit through. Even ventilation great, everyone transport distanced, getting would somewhat risky. essential workers almost much danger Frontline health care workers yet wait far far longer vaccine, also even make 25% Frontline healthcare workers do?



Fuck us, right? Thanks volunteering hard work nurse! remember days too. remember sitting girlfriend around time showing saying “Hey I’ve got bad feeling this.” put perspective already battled cancer I’d imagine he’s always worrying returning degree. It’s ridiculous. good needs global occurrence know fact. I'm thinking warehouses cavernous, break rooms always seem back store. possible forbidden, very, inconvenient do. Um. approved FDA. EUA issued due global pandemic. thing.

It also long term studies (some vaccines take decade+ test thoroughly). 

So want people stop vax shaming pretending like blindly trust thay vaccine wont give us cancer horrible ailment 5 years despite sides misusing misrepresenting scientific data benefit fucking year.

Particularly even know stops vaccinated people spreading alternative is, instances, behave responsibly work home. Put nicely, individuals making poor decisions. shows sad state education country. understand can’t vaccinate everyone once, many compared countries (Uk, Israel...)? mostly ""Haha told you, idiots!"" post, value newsworthy. politician killed virus definitely news. Especially since rare someone age group. Stealing always option, comes consequences people wish avoid. bags candy contaminated poison steal might problem would raise question government allowing mass production poison candy. Hence need know kind Dr are, seen kinds coming woodwork clue relevance viral disease. Well guy says he's doctor institute (checks notes) chiropractic adjustments taking serious. Great us mere citizens get one money college football college football season year. Schools couldn’t go without income didn’t want to. I've always used website below. interesting data different. think point stands LA county significantly worse major metros thier worse raw numbers higher cause populated county. May worse thought though. 

 Republicans care. knew January FAR worse flu. Anyone paying attention front page reddit seeing people passing streets, hospitals packed full, nurses breaking wear diapers capacity. 

Dr. Drew continued start APRIL, saying we'd NEVER hit 20,000 deaths. flu way worse (we *knew* start March fatality rate least 10x higher). likely get hit asteroid die COVID. someone put together compilation bullshit went viral retract statements. care right, loved views screentime could spout nonsense cash checks. done actual research, would've known saying pure bullshit. points parroting still ones used conservatives/anti-maskers today. Read those. seemed political scientific. China secretive considering global problem. people aren’t arms approach beyond me.

I anesthesia. virus freaking weird. Nothing I’ve seen many modes attack thing does. I’m conspiracy theorist, like I’ve said, it’s hypothesis, “ruled out,” little evidence.

I’m getting vaccine tomorrow morning. Social distancing good, virus real, masks WORK. check post history see I’m conspiracy theorist. Frequently I’m arguing non-believers.

That government drives nuts however. independent, unbiased, multinational teams going collecting data EVERYTHING. Figure everything we’ll better place fight thing, future relative also.

The fact we’ll live thing, considering potential sequelae disease, think transparency way forward. damn CCP acts like mob gestapo. tolerated. Ok thanks reply. assume fairly athletic then?

I'm lazy work out, resting HR definitely higher yours. I'm afraid would happen caught it, long short term  must size queen. feel mean months, since June, plan this. big problem 6000 hospitals total US. seem hard plan get process distributing. Lol, gaslighting. check like see. Anyway, proven either unreliable, misinformed, outright dishonest. Please Critical 0 No, still often believe NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER ONE

sigh Yeah... dont think understands correlation. 

Which ultimately point. remember telling parents beginning March going really bad stock up. told ""Did see press conference Trump gave? reassuring.""  I'm usually pretty even keel comes disagreeing politics one hold back irritation. 

""You know he's saying try stabilize stock market right? care anything else. That's cares about. "". believe me. Embarrassing understatement. It’s pathetic. accountability? able determine doses hand numbers people, able track given vaccine scheduled second shot? administering this? terrible really really shameful.

It reminds lottery luck draw. anything - Completely favors access resources - information technology, wherewithal get line, provisions stay line long possible… press conference said 70% 3 weeks first dose. That's amazing! assume equal higher efficacy 2nd dose. that's scientific studies work. can't test bunch different things small study groups mix data. can't pick choose small scale study release.

You test one hypothesis large group. That's vaccines done. far know, Astrazeneca released one study group 10 thousand people. Proud Israeli gonna lie Yeah, wife still speculate corona... Thanks Trump. First original title says. Secondly, people following Sweden closely reporting specifics interpret 243 died day, truth probably around 70-80. would post this? Turns out, sub one removes posts phrase also phrase, ""B0om3r R3m0v3r""  would guessed virus caused condition known caused viruses. Christmas numbers UK low. 3 day moving average ~ 36k, alone high second peak.

Many countries accurate reporting (US reporting particular nonsense) UK kept it. part every year worse worse finally due Indescribable climate chaos.

Almost nobody realizes truly fuct are. literally dropped emissions zero tomorrow likely still would completely f*****, bad true Pfizer shots shipped 1000/shot quantities? think might part problem. lot hospitals/care facilities trying line many people prep/dilute shots quickly ready administer them. Think nervous much handling in/out freezer rendering useless. know issue areas right now, could little bit problem. could entirely incorrect.... call CEO AstraZeneca offer support get approved, like British government did. Right +1000 people dying Germany per day. get AZ vaccine approved quickly massive damage credibility government. doesn’t sound like care, opinion doesn’t match scientific data they’ll collecting. either trolling delusional. I’m going go limb say trolling. effort guess. people infected counted cases (because majority people coronavirus never get test, either asymptomatic/have mild symptoms know simply lazy book one). start pandemic estimated _at least_ 80% cases UK missed many tests available, basically hospitalised people test. hard witness mothers amount grief.

Yet fear many young people lose life, people also governments start take serious also stop mutations spreading. exist reports SA mutation dangerous children. mutations cropping becoming inevitable. would want gamble that. Yeah might end pretty big bummer. hope overestimating increased transmissibility new strain somehow spread U.S. 

I think lockdown weeks allow vaccinations cut away spread. Jokes us :( permanent heart damage though. Many viruses Ultimately find China probably first identify disease, already circulating rest world chalking pneumonia. college basketball teams supposed this. One ones that's ended resulting player collapsing court. haters jealous cause Drew fucks mad bitches remember physicians call Covid cardiac event instead respiratory event. don’t know one comment like common knowledge. Right Pfizer. signed contracts companies well. used love listening Dr Drew lived Southern California. He’s turned real turd. He's hanging Tinhorn Flats, bar Burbank refuses close. become Trump Haven.

I live street ugh. Read thread listed. assumption. statistical analysis done one best field. No. Member States choose approve vaccine use territory. EMA's recommendation merely paves way Commission approval, grants license use Member States automatically. I've heard guess phizer vaccine came dosages expected hospitals want waste them. friend family director nursing hospital said trying vaccinate everyone could order throw get vaccinated even though lot work home. dad healthcare professional got even though works outpatient.  consider possibility same, changed? Still mention school Uni closures... sound like definition right there. need get angry, discussing vaccines science. Phase 1 2 enough prove safety, phase 3 absolutely essential this. Whelp, we're boned. Dr Drew okay YMH shows.  I'm understanding all. 

I cannot pull anything *what* 70% effectiveness actually measuring. making sense me.

I definitely appreciate trying, though. bet stock portfolio though! slightly surprised number deaths past days (since Christmas Eve) several hundred lower previously, looks like might days ""catch up"". would surprise USA 4,000 deaths recorded next day two - reasons.

In country (UK) seem able decide wheter ""Save lives, protect NHS"" ""Save Economy"" - result, either. least longer fanatically opposed masks now, good progress! makes morals cringe. think we'll still take precautions hopefully large enough percentage population immunity vaccination infection cases low. tough parent since want zero risk kid know logically age group flu presents equal risk. probably still skip leisure stuff like Great Wolf, indoor arcades, indoor playplaces get vaccinated often got sick going pre covid ways fun. Thank doing. saving lives. Hopefully things start improving you. Thank again. recall clearly reading November flu season increadibely hard year lots people dying pneumonia.

I can't find articles though. deleted post since wrong. efficiency means according NYTimes:

In case Pfizer, example, company recruited 43,661 volunteers waited 170 people come symptoms Covid-19 get positive test. 170, 162 received placebo shot, eight received real vaccine.

From numbers, Pfizer’s researchers calculated fraction volunteers group got sick. fractions small, fraction unvaccinated volunteers got sick much bigger fraction vaccinated ones. scientists determined relative difference two fractions. Scientists express difference value call efficacy. there’s difference vaccine placebo groups, efficacy zero. none sick people vaccinated, efficacy 100 percent.

Source: looks like efficiency ratio placebo group vacinated group many people infected each. Well help post obviously biased pro-China viewpoint. facts support you, keep repeating facts. Maintaining neutral tone important public discourse. Feel free copy timeline repost whenever see someone post misleading information. Germans go polls September. CDU going everything bring back normality country then. Furthermore, Jens Spahn (CDU), Health Minister, widely regarded Chancellor waiting. even chance might become CDU's candidate office Chancellor September. political career credibility CDU line here. Let's never forget democracy political urgency trump concerns. Like he’s licensed medical doctor Yes case tons countries. masks actually worked, countries would better Sweden not. say true, point widespread infection masks become useless, thus pretty useless western countries anyways.

I’ll go view masks don’t actually help societal level. work individuals society whole, simple people don’t follow properly. reason need traffic police despite clear traffic guidelines drivers licenses. 

I’m epidemiologist don’t really good ideas. actual scientists certain, wouldn’t situation either. We’re almost year still don’t know handle correctly, apart island nations.

I said start long politicians take conscious decisions believe best, based knowledge time, that’s really much expect unfortunately. Thanks It’s compared placebo group.

You compare infection rates study two groups. 3 weeks, certain subset participants contracted COVID. subset, check see many placebo many vaccine. mean get vaccinated 30% chance getting it. Wellcome 2021 brings back fond memories. Thanks. China everything authoritarian, controlling lens don’t like. makes sense didn’t want guy, opthamologist, spreading would later deemed factually incorrect information. least understand China’s perspective even would revile decision briefly detain someone like country. It’s devastating died though. Dr Oz, Dr Drew .... Americans listening made TV hucksters really sad. entertainers marketers first foremost usually make wait, mumps measles rubella shots high school, made everyone wait gave cookie water nobody passed out, mental thing suddenly standing done causes lot people pass out, good precaution want pissed China. read presidents Tweets see acted. 

Remember **“LIBERATE MICHIGAN!”**

We blew knew!! mean credentialed Doctor Medicine signed promoted/attached name shoving cameras faces desperate C-List celebrities lowest, vulnerable point lives someone makes poor decisions? Hogwash say. Whomp whomp company's vaccine, Israel using ? throw staffing ratios window, nurses gonna quit!   50 sequences entire state California last month. 

How many early part month vs. end month? many LA vs. Bay Area Sacramento? many right next academic labs? 

You making many assumptions without evidence. stop it, admit know much data. dude utter disappointment years. Thank you. smartest thing I've read internet while. Anything following trial protocols terrible idea. Sure, capacity, want actually put people vaccines rolling out? It’s like getting covid going hospital good time. agree see restrictions gradually diminished circumstances restrictions indoor activities last go, hopefully people reckless think little chance hospitalized case. Drew front lines aids epidemic eighties, he’s talking ass. God bless Bill Melinda Gates, y’all vaccine conspiracy morons need get names mouths, go buy high school biology textbook read gain baseline knowledge virus transmitted. instead posting insane crap FaceBook, go Wikipedia read pages “Spanish Flu”, “Black Death”, “Polio Vaccine”. Paywalled mainly feel sad 2 tiny children lost dad. Bummer :/ hold hand, since clearly need it. 

Experts intellectually honest people able use Google Scholar. 

The main one Verity et al. April Lancet. nearly 1,700 citations already. link long mobile find here: CDC pandemic planning IFRs shit Friendly reminder poverty worsens year-over-year nation Republicans continue give tax cuts wealthiest people planet taxing Working Poor much possible No. efficacy vs effect happens get COVID separate data points. Maybe it’s time stop exploiting animals reason. lost respect ""Dr."" Drew ridiculous denial virus. blatant selfish stunt get air, offered half-assed apology willingness front-lines help out, I'm sure accomplish.

Fuck guy. heyday, me, nothing better radio Loveline read book years ago. came remember discussing friend ever real outbreak could see going like book (minus zombies course).

As everything unfolded year, still believe right book would be. Yo exactly, basis science adjusting position new information presented. Free made statements based info time, shifted statements available data changed. isn’t kind morality that. Y’all radicalized media. prefer small, artisanal Pharma personally. Okay gotcha, whatever works! “Tell like is” got Trump. I'm engaging you. I'm ""frustrated"" - think bad person I'm little sick running people like think whole thing joke. get - person matters world smarter allll scientists. go away. not? Seize Opportunity. lol far, far late. We've already vaccine state two weeks. 80% doses gathering dust freezers.

Why national guard ordering doses setting drive throughs mall parking lots? hivemind wants downvoted agree. reasonable empathetic people like criticize. You’re staying obvious point... still got weird feeling personal thing.

Please.. don’t try take away 😬 sad surprised :( city also seen huge crime wave increase shootings. know it’s kids school, people realize teens risk nothing else gangs increase. things used keep kids gangs like sports, school mentoring cancelled. 

I think going look back school closures mistake. believe means 30% participants trial contracted covid 3 weeks vaccine's first dose.

It not. means every 100 people get vaccinated real thing got sick, 30 people got vaccinated got sick (when counting cases appear 3 weeks shot). Look European country see lockdowns work dramatically. South Dakota 800k citizens.. c'mon.

Please, go outside america look European countries happened everytime ease measures. much funner names boobs here. ""Sweater Kittens"" personal favorite track people 2nd shots? wondering. imagine everyone wants give SSN something need kind unique identifier ideally something track online. anyone know effectiveness relates new ""UK strain""? I've heard need much higher vaccine efficiency fight it. still enough? see infos link, timeline style formatting make easier read. Kids adapted better give credit for. Kids survived wars displaced natural disasters etc. 1-2 years distance learning isn’t ideal it’s destroying generation. I'm still understanding...

Did recipients Covid begin with? not?

And comparing placebo? measuring symptoms, compare get symptoms not? placebo measurement play effective vaccine measurement outcome either symptomatic asymptomatic?

Edit: hold on, added stuff message... let read edit comment.

Edit 2: yea, I'm still understanding it. need keep trying. guess concept understand. Tbf heard California hospitals cut majorly number CNAs nursing ratio reduced back early 00s. Although idk like states. Hold prepare surprised face... small number world population develop sever psychotic symptoms. Correlation mean causation would rather easy spot man made virus , however not. It’s mutant strain corona virus

COVID (SARS-coV-2) closely related SARS (SARS-coV). key changes genetic code. yer figures weeks going look good.  saw something first cases appearing December late November want relay remember someone China subreddit (a foreigner living Wuhan) asking anyone heard pneumonia everyone talking about. wanted know anyone else heard anything anyone thought real hysteria. first days December already talked around Wuhan... enough foreigner picking it. He's basically Joe Rogan precursor. Liberal guy becomes moderate becomes rich becomes conservative. good news detailed data needed. you’re Dr....giving advice...and made public figure based providing “professional” consultation. case it’s same, one interview could easily influence thousands people. takes one person create spreader event. Yep hear thing example Austin, oasis shall say education community awareness sea skepticism. Agree. Maybe America needs scientific re-alphabetization first.  died “with” key factor , posted edgy comment doesn’t conform subs beliefs im expecting incoming downvotes 3 .. 2 .. singing theme tune. think problem hospitals overwhelmed though. Hopefully enough vaccines local pharmacies pick THIS. Treading water easier swim swimming easier you’re fat. Nothing effective getting done Inauguration Day.

We grossly incompetent likely traitorous figure head executive branch right now. Translation interview published 1/31/2020:

Beijing News: police admonish you?


**Li Wenliang**: December 30, 2019, made statement university class group ""Seven cases SARS confirmed Wuhan South China Fruit Seafood Market"". that, police classified said rumor, admonished.


Beijing News: police admonish you?

**Li Wenliang**: admonished January 3, 2020 went home day. police detain, warn, fine them. don’t know 7 people admonished, don’t know occupations in.


Beijing News: original intention spreading news?


**Li Wenliang**: doctor Department Ophthalmology Wuhan Central Hospital. time, seven people South China Fruit Seafood Market went hospital treatment later quarantined. Initially, test results 7 people showed infected SARS coronavirus. sent messages group remind everyone relatives take precautions. also instructed everyone group spread news test report outside. expect (the news) spread soon.


Beijing News: agree qualitative nature rumors?


**Li Wenliang**: think spread rumors, reminding everyone take precautions. virus test report published classmate group sent colleague hospital. report showed test performed Shenzhen Huada Gene Technology Co., Ltd. number 7 people infected also told colleague. One hour sending message, gave explanation class group. said 7 people isolated hospital confirmed infected coronavirus, virus type still identified. everyone paid attention matter back then, might outbreak today.

[Li Wenliang's picture admonishment want continue work front line recovering suspected novel coronavirus pneumonia

Beijing News: infected?

**Li Wenliang**: January 8th, treated 82-year-old female ophthalmologist. suffered acute angle-closure glaucoma, fever symptoms. patient developed fever next day. CT results showed ""ground glass lesions lungs"", consistent viral pneumonia. Later, female patient ruled common viral infections, mycoplasma chlamydia infections, time hospital test kit confirmed patient, diagnosed time. time, many people care, hospital take special protective measures, careless contact patients. Later, hospitalized January 12 fever cough. suspected case novel coronavirus pneumonia.


Beijing News: situation now?

**Li Wenliang**: receiving isolation treatment Respiratory Critical Care Unit Wuhan Central Hospital. Difficulty breathing, oxygen tube plugged in, unable get up, talk, occasionally look phone, type communicate others. worried first, doctor would comfort daily rounds. longer feverish, mental state better previous days. believe hospital doctors definitely help recover.

Beijing News: live period isolation?

**Li Wenliang**: sleep 5 6 hours every night, squint day. Every day, hospital canteen deliver meals, including rice, fried vegetables, meat, etc., eating, drinking, urinating bed. addition, watch video family every day chat text.

The Beijing News: Internet, people said physician qualification certificate revoked.

**Li Wenliang**: Fake, physician qualification certificate revoked.

Beijing News: family?


**Li Wenliang**: me, parents also developed fever symptoms. CT lungs showed ground-glass lesions. receiving treatment hospitals Wuhan, fine major problem. People whose parents 60s 70s understand (conditions), say discharged two negative nucleic acid results. wife ophthalmologist hospitals, child 5 years old. wife lives children mother-in-law's home.

Beijing News: impact incident brought family life?

**Li Wenliang**: admonished special impact me. Thank everyone concern support. relaxes lot.

Beijing News: recovery, want do?

**Li Wenliang**: recovering, want return front line soon possible continue see patients. update China cases? quiet lately ... saw article. Atlantic doom gloom. idea happen, *especially* everyone BBQ fully vaccinated, don’t see general public taking kinds precautions. Texas, go 6 8 patients... Checkmate, CA. Well parents fail parent, expect? Except this. sad people go this. Unfortunately listening idiot president. hope everyone idiot voted gets now. care you, cares fame money. Sometimes live learn hard way get pay for. lets see next strain covid-19 gets here. Never follow evil, corrupt, money hungry, thief racist devil. evil eventually perish destined live long miserable life rotten souls! keep lying? stayed hotel? clearly know nothing vaccine development stop chatting arse. US handled process vaccine approval well. issue AZ vaccine unclear data. US isn’t ordering AZ vaccine focusing producing vaccine, better.  read title as: “19 months downplaying virus, Dr. Drew Pinsky tests positive COVID. d'aww thanks Gold &lt;3 Yeah, giving kind conservative estimate based early preliminary numbers. 

For people severe symptoms, least 1/3 long-haul COVID-19, people mild cases too. people long-haul COVID symptoms get better eventually (after weeks months). 

We know sure long-lasting health consequences be; even lowest estimates suggest number deaths *far* higher number people lasting health consequences. 

It's easy see major problem public health systems, even vaccines stop disease spreading further. heart goes people without access nationalized healthcare help pay long-term medical treatment; especially people working low-wage essential jobs forced interact public daily. anyone says ""I trust American people bahve responsibly"" completely full shit, probably advocate low accountability want get caught whatever they're doing. disagree.. trying make point pandemic going accentuate problems necessarily improve them.

In event, enjoy New Year fam fingers crossed better(ish) times ahead! went soldier. discovered North Korea weaponized it? vaccinated put basic training. vaccinated given orders. department health sends pharmacy partnership pharmacy partnership sends DOH. ""They"" can't tell us clinics dates be. can't tell us might know clinics be. can't tell us many people ahead us. one answers. one tell us answers might come.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* China owes nothing!!!! People really suck freedom. TBT!!! think many people understand (yet) variant easier catch may also difficult fight off. want face implications that. That's actually intriguing important question right now. Given supply constraints BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, escalating numbers daily cases deaths Germany, Jens Spahn's political ambitions election September, think approval happen January, either EMA German regulator. Moderna deliver enough doses make dent. Germany EU need AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine. curious, book 2nd jab? Like identifier use? give unique number bar code something? required return facility get 2nd jab done anywhere? Thinking rare freezer rare, baseless dear mongering. Understood. Guess assume 10s millions vaccines given daily otherwise tell fear mongering.

Let know want come back reality. nature already paid enough imbeciles occupying lands, enough. 

On hand don’t go confront nations residents give zero fs transmit-able virus? March country went lockdown last social public meal doctor knew.

Me : fucking overreacting. wuhan disease like 0.3% death rate.

Doc friend : 0.3% DEATH RATE HIGHER 0% DEATH RATE CONCERNING. Glass half empty Aaah!! Thank clearing up. Ok bruv course comes Trump Republicans. last place countries authorised vaccine time? Meanwhile California, high iq democrat leadership clearly everything control 😎🤙 situation? You’re welcome! realised yesterday efficacy calculation wasn’t simple originally thought. Exactly, flat misinformation. got mine yesterday! seems trivially easy, logistically politically, prevent force needed. haven’t made single joke entire thread. thing that’s funny angry sensitive insane assumptions you’re making random internet stranger. think pandemic deadly? Shocker yes do. think lockdowns deadly? Shocker yes do. “believe” science? (Didn’t know something “believe” in) whaddya know, shocker yes do.

Also 12? Cause shouldn’t talking you’re 18. Fuckin duh I'm frustrated fact many Americans selfishly unwilling take SIMPLE PREVENTION MEASURES seriously, point (mercifully thankfully) human ingenuity step curb spread instead. attitude zero personal responsibility/accountability. Somebody else fix it.

And someone always does, necessity, dangerous game play. easy done planning communication. 

If 9+ months come kind plan.. want u stop saying bruh Put back week exam students 2 normal.

Gavin said break chain infection rates shooting up.....like kids 2 weeks, chain breaking stupid moron. Thanks link! That's lengthy read need sit digest. UK's variant, opposed variant first detected UK? We're pretty good sequencing here... absolutely right. overwhelming mass vaccination sites. imagine many people could move day if, example, every school parking lot country administering doses 24/7 run await next shipment. Couple sufficiently broad first group millions, we'd moving ahead fast can.

Everything seen thus far suggests logistics bottleneck neither manufacturing shipments. instead actual 'jabbing', requires lot coordination. Plus, initial group narrow (e.g., hospital workers) wind suffering much 'dead time' first sentence bit unclear...

Covid-19 *not* caused variant original SARS virus 2003.

Instead, caused entirely new virus altogether, albeit related virus family viruses original SARS-1 virus.

Luckily, global efforts enough able contain eventually eradicate original SARS virus spread widely able control. get lucky year. Except real board certified doctor successful practice, addition TV personality I’m sure complained money going Pakistan anti Semitic waste cells. Fuck It’s probably spread much know point. It’s possible contain anything point, US gave long ago. Where's source them? without baseless fear mongering delay urethra spiders 2022 wonder Jimmy Kimmel still friends. Jimmy’s politics sure different Corolla’s. really appreciate Kimmel’s nightly Trump/political commentary. No, mortality rate flu people 40. comparison works age 10. Unlikely US.

Are PRC citizens nationals PRC ROC? remember patient 31. That's none a press release, Oregon Department Agriculture said won’t disclose farm located, citing medical privacy laws Look state's website. point willfully ignorant. Great, next time try obnoxious it. please leave quote studies support claim, that's usually works. get say logic. Otherwise yell logic louder makes right. current evidence shows vaccine deployment speeding up. explained can't use historical data vaccine unlike others.

Also nothing production, nearly 10million doses sitting unused. Logic would dictate using quickly would goal given everyone sitting them, logic must say can't use faster.

Just hope faster make so. hope win lottery mean happen. shitting China plays narrative. Well said information publicly available. Oxford AZ vaccine one that’s published peer reviewed journal making quite easy least see data point. 

As far reason 0.5 dose wasn’t approved reported news today (I read bbc). AZ initially reported results followed announcing another trial investigate 0.5 dose carried USA. assume confirms earlier findings submit approval. 2nd dose specified 12 weeks first, maximum period. allow many people within priority groups get first dose therefore protection soon possible. information news articles UK government website.

While it’s true details submitted regulator moment covering recent data trials (as case biontech well believe), lot questions publicly available knowledge. part point originally don’t know doesn’t mean answer isn’t available. However, yes happy trust this. experts field I’m even field even information available (which would like see well) would still trust decision made. I’m arrogant enough assume information I’ve picked life qualifies disagree made profession. really ""already done"", never got past Phase 1 trials. Hypothetically SARS-1 came back, imagine still need least fast tracked phase 3 prove works, difference negligible /u/reefine freaking saints!! Thank you, both! No, they're even remotely similar. Russia well documented history conveniently disappearing removing dissidents state...and includes russian doctors scientists raise raised concerns safety efficacy vaccine.. severely immune compromised 20 year old also fairly unlikely benefit much getting vaccine (ya know...because immune compromise). think Sputnik little hard trust given lack transparency information Russia. also started administer fully tested, effectively testing population. 1. I'm sure question relevant. variant found September California surge started earnest late November early December. Either way, shown Twitter precisely collected. would assume would knowledge timing important statistical analysis.
2. 24 53 California samples sequenced December Los Angeles. likely aware location strains (as normal part sequencing) again, sure relevant comes findings.
3. question makes sense. would even matter? Also stale ER coffee 5am. Nothing quite brings perspective like sipping liquid acid. two surgeries. first done properly, sorta botched depth one needed. Setting readmitted suddenly needed space, emergency surgery doctor made had. 

The second surgical place adjacent hospital could see open glass/foyer emergency room turned COVID intake room PACKED. Every time see someone without mask can't help want hate little. 

Very sorry hear family friend, that's awful. condolences. love “listen doctors” people acting like know much doctor idea, 6 documented? Stupidness selfishness spans across political parties. That’s right number look at. want number represents chance dying, regardless happening demographic groups part of. California reported 425 deaths yesterday. That’s like, what, 6000 US deaths nationwide? representing contents study correctly. Nowhere say 30% chance heart damage contracting covid. 

""The U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention tweeted Sept. 17, ""Heart conditions like myocarditis associated cases #COVID19. Severe cardiac damage rare occurred, even young, healthy people.""

COVID-19 research proceeding countries Thailand, Dr. Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, coronavirus expert, leading teams scientists deep countryside collect samples bats. one expedition August, Supaporn told AP virus could found “anywhere” bats.

Chinese scientists quickly started testing potential animal hosts. Records show Xia Xueshan, infectious diseases expert, received 1.4 million RMB ($214,000) grant screen animals Yunnan COVID-19. State media reported February team collected hundreds samples bats, snakes, bamboo rats animals, ran picture masked scientists white lab coats huddled around large, caged porcupine.

Then government restrictions kicked in. Data samples still made public, Xia respond requests interview. Although Xia co-authored dozen papers year, AP review shows, two COVID-19, neither focused origins.

Today, caves scientists surveyed close watch authorities. Security agents tailed AP team three locations across Yunnan, stopped journalists visiting cave researchers 2017 identified species bats responsible SARS. entrance second location, massive cave teeming tourists taking selfies, authorities shut gate AP.

“We got call county,” said park official, armed policeman showed up.

Particularly sensitive mine shaft closest relative COVID-19 virus — called “RaTG13” — found.

RaTG13 discovered outbreak 2012, six men cleaning bat-filled shaft fell ill mysterious bouts pneumonia, killing three. Wuhan Institute Virology China CDC studied bat coronaviruses shaft. although scientists believe COVID-19 virus origins nature, say close relative could transported Wuhan leaked mistake.

Wuhan Institute Virology bat expert Shi Zhengli repeatedly denied theory, Chinese authorities haven’t yet allowed foreign scientists investigate.

Some state-backed scientists say research proceeding usual. Famed virologist Zhang, received 1.5 million RMB ($230,000) grant search virus’ origins, said partnering scientists sending samples over, including bats Guizhou southern China rats Henan hundreds miles north.

“Bats, mice, new coronaviruses them? particular coronavirus?” Zhang said. “We’ve work decade. It’s like started today.”

Zhang declined confirm comment reports lab briefly closed publishing virus’ genetic sequence ahead authorities. said hasn’t heard special restrictions publishing papers, review papers go routine scientific one institution.

But scientists without state backing complain getting approval sample animals southern China extremely difficult, little known findings government-sponsored teams. Definitely wiser me!

Fellow NY'er here... seen anything similar 2021? can’t excercise bad diet. Diet way important exercise. Yeah, that's vaccine leading mutations. people getting infected leading new variants.

1. Wednesdays days registers cross-checked find deaths replrted already, meaning Wednesday numbers usually significantly higher average
2. extra large backlog currently due Christmas holidays
3. normal week, Sweden reports new numbers 4 7 days. means reported deaths often higher actual deaths. numbers reported Christmas eve day, meant extra delay reporting.
4. actual number daily deaths currently seem around 60 - 80. high, far 200.

It’s especially interesting downvotes come comments Reddit hate boner Nestle, company similarly callous history. “Should” scary word. Yeah, stands reason we've captured 25 percent actual infections US assume IFR 0.45 seems general consensus moment. think limited testing capacity especially early days nightmare contributing undercount well.

So currently 24 percent population that's infected, ways go yet hit magic number 70 percent immune. Though, still understand experts keep saying need 80 percent population get vaccinated end. Even natural infections occurred, seems like we'd good go 50 percent getting vaccinated 30 second mental math... countries could put together international committees approve vaccine everyone?

Is REALLY time dig heels needless redtape? thing worse mindless bureaucrats ones know jobs go away left process.

&amp;#x200B;

I work federal government see needless garbage like daily basis I've always wondered actually means. 20% people tested coughing fever dreams night? 20% random surveillance general population? later would useful statistic. lot factors play statistics including population density, climate, fact NY's surge right beginning pandemic knew benefit things like dexamethasone prone nursing. Even way COVID statistics counted differ choice difference two state's outcomes whether Republican Democrat run arbitrary capricious.

While agree regulations *are* illogical inconsistent, whether state seeing surge new infections pressure ICU beds permitting indoor concerts large packed crows brainer. not, called law, Congress passes laws time. can't smoke pot law. can't use heroin law. can't .50 cal. machine gun law. infringe rights. What's difference? Congrats, basically described every politician although dress better others lol. support simply pointed people literally obsessed much cannot stop thinking him. initial comment that. Honest question, normally read news english people normally say died covid complications rather died covid? seems like subtle intentional difference since know people saying ""covid kill you, underlying conditions"" LOL oh feelings hurt.

According first article, US buying additional Biontech/Pfizer vaccice doses ~$19.50/dose (100M $1.95B)

According second article, EU bought additional 100M $18.90/dose. prices hugely looks like Sanofi vaccine lot problems. know recover vaccines ramp production. Average lifespan decline well no? Agree, everyone vaccinated one less vector age get bonus vulnerable motivated people protected well.  couple amount people community already Covid could probably see transmission drop within month.  coupled nursing homes would great aim.

Has nothing higher efficacy.

J&amp;J would preferred due single dose, discussions options choose from, maybe later next year. vaccine shortages. think depends state. getting vaccines begin with, infrastructure roll (freezers, etc), would bet political leanings state govt. states well. every state challenge. Right. Ring 2021 thinning herd. Yup, Marion county opened system yesterday. AFAIK, Lee county crazy Black Friday line situation. majority long covid cases mild infections. switzerland study mild cases, 30% developed long covid. also found around 70% organ damage 4 months might wrong wrong place post this. 🥸 professor could made vaccine coconuts bamboo. going bunch people sitting around talking unmasked. Regulations going change that. doesn’t.

Am right assume answering question ""Does Dr. Fauci’s number include infected?""

Nobody talks big deal.

So, 70% bottom number range, right.

Okay, take 1/(1-.7*.95). gets us 2.98. Anyone fully confident R0 3? Nope, neither.

Okay, let's take 70% add 6% confirmed cases. We'll assume full immunity those. going assume none first count. rosy assumptioins. So, run numbers get R0 3.64. Okay, that's getting there. I've seen 4.0 R0 thrown around.

Okay, let's assume additional 3x undiagnosed rate. What's going us? that's 18% population. we've vaccinated 70% group. Well, actually more. We've vaccinated (.7/.94) = 74% group. .26*.18 = gives us another 5%.

Okay, run numbers again. R0 4.44. Okay, that's high. high. Particularly new strain also potentially lower efficacy rates later vaccines.

And that's number barely break 1.0 Rt. see solid decline instead slowly coming back down, we'll need higher numbers and/or continued precautions. I'm confident we'll even able keep masks people hit 30% 40% vaccination levels. Jesus fucking Christ. want see weaponized warts article post about. anyone read article? Lol still eat bugs.

""Culled"" often means put blender days old. saddest part is, probably better life torture (yes, torture) females go through.

On subject dairy, know required cows produce milk? need children. Constantly. think happens children (which immediately taken away them, causing unknown psychological damage tortured mothers).

I already really see point getting vaccinated especially still spread vaccination. understand taking long distribution happen. vaccines, correct? people's bodies yet significant numbers? 2 million vaccinated. What's hold up? related ""a procedure,"" due blood clot.

Probably malpractice. Louisiana, all... I'm scientist familiar Typhoid Mary, carrier typhoid, never actually sick it, might similar great they, though, really? young adult flu-like chances dying Covid. sole reason I'm looking get vaccinated avoid ""long Covid"", reported happen even people mild infection. still got 30-40% chances catching ""mild"" Covid infection Astra Zeneca vaccine... still kinda sucks? imagine that's go I've heard rumors exactly that. next round vaccines distributed geriatric clinics along cancer clinics clinics care high risk patients ages. clinics serve gatekeeper need vaccine. “Rep.-elect Luke Letlow died heart attack procedure related coronavirus”

So COVID might primary condition attributed death. I’m sure angle posting good news trying real hard reply people wasnt COVID heart attack. slim photos displayed video old photos. Look ones Christmas. pretty clear gained lot weight.

[Photo /u/AmazingObligation9 /u/full-of-grace That’s great news! Hopefully seriously slows virus Israel. seems first country really see effects vaccines. Latest thing reported Danish media, AstraZeneca sent data EMA, EMA considers they’ve received insufficient. 

AstraZeneca honestly seem like they’re rushing, completely top right now. Hopefully make right soon enough. lot athlete deaths drop dead nowhere past either congenital defects myocarditis. Indeed examined Yeah it’s risk theaters. smallpox mostly PACOM (Pacific) right now. Maybe AFRICOM (Africa)?

They stopped blanket vaccinating like decade ago. obvious. I'm phases, getting vaccine populations risk. sitting doses poor strategy given scope vaccination effort. 

It would like 100 loads laundry do, one washer one dryer. going move one load washer, dryer, fold 99 sit? 

Or going make sure time loads washer dryer folding.

There correct answer this, unless work laundromat get paid hourly. many people heart attacks intubation? Right, distribution includes decision making on-site. Like average healthcare worker planning rollout structuring tiers. administering plans people give them. Agreed gets ""retail"" side, it'll lot better, think. 

That said, think NG would good - personally feel like it'd feel inspiring see part military really engaging important part communities' histories. worry little bit people lining Costco Walmart overwhelming retail locations set mass vaccinations. Even ideal conditions, got flu vaccine year, took 15-20min sign papers get booth.

I'm angry. Two people know vaccinated work healthcare. Great patients, find grossly unfair. lived life totally normally. parties, went out, normal life stuff. One got covid, parties anyway. I'm sure did. Either way, sacrifice anything, get vaccine. what, get sit inside like hole likely another year?

The worst part one actually got covid someone family died covid, without pre-existing conditions. big christmas party anyway week anyway like happen. just. even bother. watch two live life normal I've lost much world. seemingly nothing, they're front line vaccine. FML. belive reported sub 50 cases per day true since MARCH, whole world goes shit? kind magic achieve this?

enlighten pls

US worst US, gladly announce never trust another thing comes china good job guess. Ah ok looks like they're conducting 1 dose 2 dose trials see one effective. Whatever treat disease worked. disease kill him. want Covid not? shit... Health Ministry says 51 650,000 people received Pfizer shot sought medical attention symptoms Fourteen people said allergic reactions itching swelling tongue Additionally, 26 people suffered ministry described “neurological symptoms,” 19 complaining tingly sensation ministry noted 51 people (0.008%) reported suffering side effects said sought medical attention symptoms.  doubt ""procedure"" mole removal logically probably intubation. 

So still covid death. fatalities 20's &amp; 30's across country many survive face life long health issues. one returning normal vaccinated. perpetuate dangerous myth affects elderly compromised. two roughly equal groups (in size, demographics, exposure risks), group vaccinated would 70% less likely get sick given period time group wasn't.

Edited add: what's less clear whether ""sick"" means caught covid means caught covid symptoms. That's important preventing symptoms, vaccinated people could still spread disease potentially see long-term effects. swimming actually easier fat, fat floats! submitted data, currently reviewed EMA. EMA says need data start procedure approval Yes.

As see, steady around 80k since then. *real* increase like rest world. China hundreds millions cases based numbers rest world.

Okay, probably hundreds millions, get point. might actually one bring virus knees. know type capacity/doses might anticipated availability upon rollout? Lol thank you. messing around Hi everyone,

Can someone help understand saying vaccine might prevent someone getting sick, might prevent getting transmitting someone else fact relates vaccine trial results?

I understand basic concept saying might help prevent getting sick, might still enough system transmit it.

I get that, issue is, correlate Pfizer results say know people still transmit it?

I've copied brief summary results:

===========================

Among 36,523 participants evidence existing prior SARS-CoV-2 infection time immunizations, 170 cases COVID-19 observed onset least 7 days second dose; 8 cases occurred vaccine recipients, 162 placebo recipients, corresponding 95.0% vaccine efficacy (95% credible interval [CI, 90.3, 97.6]). Among participants without evidence prior SARS CoV-2 infection, 9 cases COVID-19 among vaccine recipients 169 among placebo recipients, corresponding 94.6% vaccine efficacy (95% CI [89.9, 97.3]).

================

So, example, let's use first bit data stating 170 ""cases observed"" onset least 7 days second dose vaccine. cases, 8 vaccine group 162 placebo group, thus 95% efficacy.

So, guess question is, say ""cases observed"", referring symptomatic presentation? actually test COVID, also?

What people cases ""were observed""? mean actual negative COVID test symptoms?

If ""not observed"" people (AKA, 95%) negative COVID tests, mean COVID systems prevented becoming infected, thus capable spreading people, b/c system?

Wouldn't answered question?

I'm really confused all, basically.

Pretty much phase system going flawed. Young people spread most, probably likely willing get vaccine, vaccinating young first would reduce spread consequently reduce hospitalizations death. time, old people much vulnerable virus also best interest vaccinate ASAP too. point is, system going tradeoffs would much better people lined use 100% available supply daily sit around phase bullshit wasting time. country needs normalcy, vaccine supplies used entirely daily basis there's huge problem.

Two main reasons: 
1. increased transmissibility means hospitals face additional pressure, meaning quality care may decreased patients flood in. 
2. higher rate transmission, herd immunity threshold higher. means higher percentage people need vaccinated. hate break you, they’re raised pets. cities US suburban parking lots match. good analogy

Because little point buying extra doses getting months end. Pfizer Moderna vaccines bottled supply buy many like, mean getting anytime soon.

It's academic Oxford vaccine approved. Meanwhile.. uk start vaccination ASAP. strain needs stopped *narrator*

Everyone asking alive, answer. know happened surely incapable posting getting video.
Maybe Bell's palsy?

This that’s forfeit able evict paying rent. '12 weeks jabs' approach completely untested, though. There's published trial data (so far) vaccines two jabs 12 weeks - trials run suggested 2 weeks jabs.

And using vaccine fast-tracking concerns [data], less.

Ridiculous. Might well skip trials use untested vaccine. significant production bottle neck. US supposed nearly 10 times number vaccines ready go right currently. difficulty getting vaccines arms daunting much helped trump administration’s laissez faire attitude toward distribution level getting vaccine storage facilities production seriously behind right causing problems. one shamed anyone. invented it

The person originally responding to, you’re defending, shaming person wanting eventually things like see friends person. Why? need car drive there. lol. Proof thin one - ""battlefield promotion"" vaccine never would approved peacetime data.  still see useful.

But different thread, someone pointed Pfizer ModeRNA PCR asymptomatics.  Remember PCR quite sensitive detect asymptomatics sometimes. never saw detailed Ct viral load data Oxford PCR positives symptoms. likely high Cts (low viral load) contagious too. Also positive PCR told it, going think itchy throat headache hangover. comparisons 95% ModeRNA Pfizer apples:oranges. Meanwhile, EMA postpones makes month later.

The EMA postpone anything. EMA complained AstraZeneca supply enough data review vaccine even applied approval yet... argument better get half decent level immunity twice many people, rather 95% immunity half many people. longer true. Ontario announced Phizer advised vaccinate many people possible guarantees doses come within safe timeframe. drinking tea watching cricket bruv innit ? Well, oxford vaccine certainly demonstrate level efficacy Pfiser Moderna ones appear to, 60% still lot better nothing. also 1/5 1/10 price 2 vaccines require super-cold storage; makes process distribution vastly simpler.

No. Relatively children gotten sick Covid know, really much infectious strain, also makes children actually sick, though gravely. bad news children underlying conditions immunocompromised. *and people?* say fuck let virus kill millions? 65+ 16% US population. 75+ less 10%. lol. way would ever men first policy vaccines.

TLDR UK bet wrong horse covid vaccine race come one sub mentioning Israel? secured large amount Pfizer Moderna vaccines currently vaccinating population faster country Ourworldindata global tracker. 

Countries states report often though, assume many vaccines administered reported. public vaccinations dumb. Anyone believe you, still easy fake. terrible attempt cheap pop serves literally purpose.

And semi rural hospitals got 1000 1200 total city 15000. plenty, anyone who's healthcare worker get vaccine day appt.

Anyway, Africa permanently warm climates maybe helps too.  new guidance recommendation people conditions get vaccine generally, considerations around decision.

They took ER treated reaction, everything turned fine. left hospital reaction car getting home things could turned much worse. long ago Covid? currently dealing it? becomes yearly thing, going shut every winter? people Southern Hemisphere go North vice versa. know that? cite that? Entire threads people basically saying there's zero enforcement people adhering still lockdowns.

It's pretty simple, tell people close shop without financial backing people ignore it. situation forgo treatment people hospitals overflowing smokers, would favor stopping treatment smokers first, you? would also never favor lockdown protect smokers (yes, absurd, sake argument). entire society suffer somebody deliberately decides care health? everyone wanted vaccinated, moral justification suffer choices others, utterly absurd. EMA constant contact AZ make approval process easy possible? would negligent sitting hands waiting email phone call. Everyone blaming feds. looks like state state roll vastly different. state can’t even get 50,000 doses given arms yet. Idk doing. Sure, here's answer: elected incompetent fucking moron fucked.

Dead ears, course, collection evolutionary dead ends voted Trump again. 

Fuck Florida. deserve this. Guess Cuomo *really* wanted go Bills game year... Plus might already infected/asymptomatic. know. Certainly are. bear mind population differences. US population 328 million Israel population 9 million. shows raw numbers US done vaccines, taking account population Israel vaccinated 7% population compared 0.8% US population vaccinated He’s lying. said would range. Don’t listen don’t want. short list people trustworthy regarding virus top. find anyone credible please post name find them. Cool, cool. guess A-Okay mow 82 year-olds traffic? they're past average life expectancy anyway?

Then again, everyone knows old people \*are\* useless.... /s talked woman drive 2 1/2 hours get dose. luck finding appointment around Tampa Bay.

Follow reasonable allocation plan get done. plan going perfectly account less risk, less ""essential"", whatever criteria used. resources spent better spent getting peoples' arms little logistical delay possible. I've staying home since March 2020. want waste best years life staying home. want fun, meet new people. activities mentioned old. Potato, potato....it’s something executive could potentially use push something states. cannot administer allocation prioritized targets open next group, public, good arm shelf. point, think that's possible. probably even possible March due widespread worldwide was.

So thanks, confirmation go forever. need. 13,800 added? That’s ridiculous. Florida could 20,000 cases added. They’ve good reporting numbers. could 35,000 become infected day? remember reading article said mind believe god likely believe conspiracies pseudoscience guess seeing fact action, sadly. vaccines contain live virus aren’t supposed take around e.g. cancer patients. Including potential future covid19 vaccines. Play sims instead improving choice. I'm taking advantage additional time upgrade knowlege online, practice music make things workshop. shaming, saying. federal government do?

I never hope going anywhere found tracing states literally people printing excel sheets people needed contacted editing called.

I hadn’t seen US map high reported cases two days, saw last night shocked. Florida’s always hot zone still pretend everything fine. Nurse responsibilities already increasing. Some, most, hospitals removing LPNs reducing CNAs give registered nurses responsibility. went plaid Looks like political heat starting make changes happen. 

As much Florida clinics look like mess (huge lines hours), something along lines may best way go. Setup mass vaccination site invite wide audience easily verified (age great takes ID).

I'm sure trust opinion someone thinks 20 million people vaccinated using two doses fundamentally different 40 million doses available end year. Colorado seems capable state level Governments Yeah someone 82 dying isn’t news. Sure it’s sad. 82 year old dying isn’t something that’s going convince people COVID something take seriously. health orders arbitrary capricious. aren’t solving anything. Florida bigger New York older population, less restrictions far better statistics. it’s Republican run state NY Dem stronghold doesn’t fit sub’s narrative. There's good discussion two threads Nextseq contributors CI  sub cult tried explaining adding risk cancel risk, adds risk? thinking make mathematical sense.

Actually never mind. tried explaining way relatives, seem get it. seem comprehrnsion vaccine, unlike vaccine tested 10 uears therefore cannot know long term side effects. all

Wow. Amazing everything we've said, still come demonstrably false statement. 

One first things explained ten year figure average included huge amount *development time* would ever got stage trials actual humans. course vaccines tested ten years approval!

You *claimed* understand even got defensive never meant even though said start thought vaccines went ten year trials!

Now seem think every vaccine ten years trials!

This nonsense. mumps vaccine trials 1966 got approval 1967.

I mean... name single vaccine ever side effect/reaction failed manifest full TEN YEARS vaccine given?! talking about?!

What Earth made think reasonable concern worth airing public?!

It's ridiculous! Yeah nah prick comment right Executive summary: call us, we'll call you. Ah, well want whinge government generally r/unitedkingdom appropriate subreddit believe. ye Yeah! We're always looking new short non-fiction series. 

Also, we're usually accepting spec fic/sci fi subs normal publication well.  Serious question, much risk Disney world? People wearing masks, I’m sure Disney social distancing required, biggest thing it’s outdoors. 
I feel like made big deal people outdoors events like beach theme parks even election celebrations. Havent saying biggest concern indoor gatherings peoples homes? Bahrain using Chinese vaccine approved Western countries. knocking it, apples oranges. 

Isreal ahead game, population 8 million. similar dose delivery goes lot per capita. yes, unquestionably ahead us. Still, they're exception, rule. We're ahead countries besides States, EU, using Chinese Russian vaccines. 4.a. need composite approach prevention; single measure achieve 100% success, employ multiple measures layer approach 100%. Firstly, caregiver / patient ratios issue long I've alive. Maybe pandemic wake-up call drives meaningful changes healthcare delivery. Hope is.

In meantime, view nurses working commonly accepted ratios paid proportionally more. example, nurse double workload, paid double, etc.

On aside, nurses every right complain, keep mind they're participating corrupt system puts profits ahead people. changes, reforms little window dressing.

""Didn't already know months ago?""

""People know argued school reopening saying kids can't get infected since get sick hit. ""

"" know anyone believef s\*\*\* first place. That's right masks good sick.""

This sub policy editorialized titles (rule 2). Well yes, 3 weeks sure... Stupid question, I’ve staying family Oregon last 2 months. primary residence California. told there’s chance could get vaccine weeks. get Oregon I’m staying family? travel back California? love superspreader events like Rioting, Burning, Looting highly praised met glee months back religious freedom allowed. hypocrisy outstanding. week February looked like getting control. Chinese cases dropping rapidly known international outbreaks appeared contained. everything went hell. Sure lot headlines w word Christian article summarizes isn't. that's wrong.

If 5 million doses (each requiring two shots), vaccinated 5 million people. Period. Love it. cold, really stopped caring lot whether people get vaccine. I'm concerned I'm essentially last ""list"" people front stalling wringing hands whole thing. 

If scared apprehensive loonie, that's fine. get peoples' way. happening right now. distinguish.

If don’t get vaccinated, please stay away me.

Thank you. sheer amount doses produce top that. [How know someone That’s lie. lockdown one main reasons Covid fatigue thing conspiracy theories flourishing.  powerball ticket helps pay things general fund state. That's buy them.

If think conferred other, fooling yourself. could gone test time state running fevers, actually feverish. aware. suggestion still monitor athletes risk heart issues returning strenuous activity. helps avoid sort catastrophe permanent damage. agree least? AZ say provided data? clusterfuck biblical proportions. side effects? But, infectious disease stand point, know infectious disease originated can't stop current spread, take steps stop happening future. failure confirm source made certain would pandemic instead epidemic. stat incorrect. multiple reasons.
1) CDC counts Flu &amp; Pneumonia together 
2) real covid death toll lags 3-4 months sometimes due people dying home cardiac arrest due covid - people love dismiss real covid death. cruel. 
3) ”recover” covid die pulmonary embolism 3 weeks - still covid induced. 
4) Even Russia admired real death toll 3 times higher - happy blame everything covid death. 
5) Flu cause dozens mobile refrigerated trucks needed NYC. vaccines approved safety individuals, efficacy preventing severe complications COVID. likelihood also prevent transmission, science 'in likelihood'. insinuating vaccines endorsed preventing transmission, yet. 

More importantly fail address concerns around uneven vaccination. current poor rates inoculation, think anywhere close vaccination everyone 50 (in US context)? major part reason pushing continued vigilance. anywhere close level protection needed, *even vaccine fact prevent transmission*-- yet conclusive evidence of. may okay idea young people getting COVID since less likely die, think unethical ridiculous. know extent long term side effects virus, look great. Death concern. mechanics injection easy. could teach anyone shop lab experience minutes. hard parts are

 - prepared acute reactions. They're rare, raise hand want Joanne elevator mechanic calling shots faint break hives.

 - especially true normally something like flu shots low-risk patients plan ""epipen, benadryl, ambulance."" emergency medical services overloaded, people re-think that.

 - Deciding much prepare when. move dry ice fridge there's much time change mind put back. 

 - Managing number people expect need day two off. vaccine known ass-kicker, relatively speaking.

 - Uncertainty future shipments.

 - generally behind curve planning.

Not good reasons course. think going on. crazy scared death world lunatics didnt padlock everyone basements 6 months cases embarrassingly low, may residuum willingness lockdown. Instead, terrified lunatics exhausted everyone's patience good reason now, good reason, zero public willingness lock even 2 weeks. 

It crazy ""lockdown threat death next 100 years"" crowd responsible deaths now. socially inept, totally touch realities sociopaths, maybe people willingness bearbthe burden lockdown right now. blew local sheriff tested inmates staff local lockup. single inmate tested positive one staff tested positive.

If actually give damn apparently sheriff preventing spread COVID-19 actually hard. thinking along lines getting cancer right would almost guarantee severe case covid. yes covid still mystery  Single dose shot, would game changer No. 14 day isolation still place, still testing 2 dose regimen. I'm trial UK first shot 8th. 2 months wait doses (same new AZ protocol). feel confident readout efficacy take place month January, likely EUA submission take place month January,” said Slaoui, adding hopes approval submission reached first half February. else brunch single Asian girls America. know original table is, flu comparable younger see higher deaths flu 18 (~400 deaths 17 last year), covid slowly starts overtaking flu.

Plague Dogs biggest screw history 
If going lockdown lockdown completely.  You’re condescending judgement grotesque. Tell me, feel superior sophomoric comment, head table? That’s right? prove you’re better, you’ll survive get infected? think wise. become obvious healthcare systems incapable using supply timely fashion. National average 20%, even weeks delivery. 

Maybe send 60% Hospitals, 30% pharmacies, 10% businesses vaccinate critical workers. want designer baby shut originally called symptoms ""flu-like symptoms"" Americans get head this, fact, flu much worse. Americans think every virus either cold flu we're ridiculously lucky live society viruses either eradicated far less common. arrogantly think every virus inconsequential. know little virus long term consequences. Hey! One jab federal crime Depends, I'm taking part UK J&amp;J 2 dose trial (2 months doses) I'm first shot 8th January. EU actually ordering vaccines distribute member states. There's controversy Germany seeking supplement EU provision arrangements. first link site *literally* says ""A total 87,027 confirmed cases reported, *and existing suspected cases*."" shiny metal ass.

So again, ask question, cases gone since March? I've watching stay steady around 80k since according Worldmeters. I've loop while. scientific proof yet UK variant contagious previous strains? sad never hit targets people wait two weeks results, thats outrageous. Better shortage vaccines all. possibility biggest peak come sometime January early February, probably drop due vaccines, natural immunity, factors. AZ hasn’t sent sufficient data EU approval yet. last package sent 21st December EU deemed insufficient approval. don’t get what’s going AZ Jeeeeesus Christ. least guys getting vaccine. least guys, there's end pandemic sight within year. vast majority world, luxury while. Instead bitching getting country-saving vaccine, celebrate distriburing 2 million doses 15 days? Like, damn, sounds like great accomplishment. Argentina also approved AZ vaccine today. Oh really??? last m&amp;ms ever? sure ill risk bruv. truly declining (I agree there's evidence are) final major peak. Vaccinations prevent another large wave. Probably still outbreak nothing like previous waves.  want rich get richer homeless population booms?  Sorry seem comprehrnsion problem.

And include small disclaimer since people like pedantic, I’m referring people don’t choice. aren’t able work home don’t really option, sucks, point work. I’m talking selfish assholes throw caution wind reason all. he’s going president doing, convince Congress give funding state local governments better roll vaccine ensure country purchases enough instead waiting refusing purchase doses July. Listen experts instead saying “I don’t think science knows” claiming pandemic over. sorry family's loss, 18 yo much life ahead. wish people would realize COVID take anyone, short manner time. Yeah honestly sucking point. middle pandemic, don’t time wait! Citizen journalists separate mainstream media &amp; various platforms reach audiences on, privately owned, that's difference freedoms enjoy. Speech, art, etc. general China heavily suppressed government, see citizen journalist recently locked 4 years merely reporting COVID. 

Putin said numbers low theyve handled well, furthermore we've seen numerous articles hospital workers voiced complaints ""mysteriously"" falling windows. 

You keep trying tie countries together authoritarian governments, dictatorships etc. exist, different laws exist, different amounts government influence etc. Russia, China's, NK's governments know censor speech turn kills sort investigative journalism. advisor back grad school told never pose grad student internets reading comprehension continued poor.  ?? What's denial. know y'all fucking going crazy question. know means denial sort Man, worth word!! Way 2 million given out. Reporting delays. already contagious. Wtf don’t even care anyone watches long household member me. thought 30 min watch period since vaccine new. How’s command handled covid things ? Mines shit !  think able check 3/6 months mean...not really. around 121,400 yesterday think infection ends animals. There's report felines infecting humans back, plenty report minks infecting humans season 2 cliff hanger it... Makes wonder even happen many people refusing vaccine. got first dose many places work, refusing receive it. Greg Abbott needs recalled. handling tricky part. vial 5 doses it. 5 people must time brought back, vial brought cooling, simultaneously prepped, injected. orchestrated let go waste. Chop chop. need hurry up. someone doesn’t want vaccine, move next person. simple. booster dose necessary thought? else getting incomplete round antibiotics making things worse? stop many social interactions. gateqay drug covid here. :( curious kind mask use market? people work hospitals he’s pressing one million day button, then? Sorry man, keep calm. matter time prayers. gonna bounce back negative.!! would legitimately shocked wasn’t already widespread US point. joke nitwit. 200 plus got joke, are. Time relative nothing matters. Get urself lighten fuck up, else 2021 gonna devour you. remember, end, matters eventual heat death universe. Even competent administration, much inertia one carry next year? can't turn around ship fast... worry dying COVID young, healthy person way worry dying struck lightning cancer. necessarily. heart conditions go undiagnosed kill swiftly. Heart defects think especially... No. could conceivably problem road (although seriously overstating problem - people hesitant moment fine getting vaccinated time turn) issue right one logistics availability. Even half country wants get vaccinated, enough vaccines, storage them, people administer moment make happen quickly need to.

The logistics improve speed ramp up, disappointing manage better job preplanning. irony iron lungs sufficiently rare people still need rely artisanal repair maintenance. DERP DERP!

That’s cringeworthy insult I’ve ever heard. Yea want see too, remember seeing 50% article. 37 counting..evil one Thank introducing facts discussion.   Also vaccinate whole country yellow fever persons week/month. going whole scale. 

I sincerely hope issues vaccination processes feed anti vaxx... first half naive.

Even hospitals empty, 'experts' sound alarm cases they'll shutdown everything again. Anyone good planet...
Ty califatist..goodbye capitalist.. guess kinda slowing down?  mean, 6 months ago experts said chance would even get vaccine year. Yet two approved. I’m sure that’s fuck-up. think campaigns changing anyone’s mind point think you’re bit naive.  promise Texan...that didn’t happen Unfortunately you’re right that’s reflected increasing hospitalizations and, subsequently, deaths. Also, doctor Yep. doubt it’s LA, NY. matter days till find cases everywhere US. Common sense? Travel basically open UK US now. personally evaluate swedens approach success expected all. absolutely give 10 years standard vaccine new medicine trials. look up. educate self :) 

1 question you. 

How know long term side effects putting 10 year test? 

Why Pfizer insist laws passed protecting lawsuits would release vaccine?something never happens new medicines. 

I understand vaccine developed quickly etc etc. Thats point raising. one hasn’t. Private pharmacies bulk 150-180 million flu vaccinations per year. 

We start sending doses them. 

One idea would payout structure incentivizes quick roll out. example $25 shot done within 3 days $15 5 days $10 week. 

This would enable pharmacies justify elongated hours overtime pay get things moving quickly.  part said disinformation. research issues one explain trials accidentally misdosed people. covers statements. I'm disagreeing I'm saying year fighting people can't take anymore. Different people different levels tolerance. Dr Fauci making points am. Dated today. Perhaps he's well informed are.


Also aware bloomberg getting data?

""Data gathered government websites, press conferences, public statements Bloomberg interviews."" I'm pretty sure Fauci accurate numbers sludge. Seems like UK thing. It’s interesting strange corona virus already around . Agreed. great news, fantastic news, pace 8 million us vaccinated *two years*.  Look data across years. Looking single year almost meaningless. 2021? Nah 2020^2 point start ignore excessive caution Serious People. plan start soon acceptable portion high risk communities area vaccinated. Lol 😭 one “mink strain”. 

The problem mink they’re different enough humans get infected they’re different enough force virus mutate quickly normally would adapt. outbreak mink farm you’re essentially running COVID factory churns new mutations.

This could turn nothing. could easily give us COVID-20. buddy No. I’m saying invalidates whole thing. scenario Detroit spring, followed way many nurses dying. still sad time. sorry LA. come conslusion? I’m glad least something looking you. Upstate NY vaccine nice got twice I’m ICU nurse working COVID. We’ve taking 5:2 assignments past week so.. usually ICU requires 1 nurse 2 patients. we’re taking 5 patients per 2 nurses, nurses share responsibility 3rd patient them. It’s absolute nightmare patients also extremely unstable sick.  sure. probably hundred, maybe thousand, genomic samples per day. Colorado number 10. Today, 1/10 samples new strain. Every previous day 0/10.  samples probably infections least two weeks ago, that's important part timeline.

There 24 samples sequenced LA December. 0/24 new strain.

This strain cannot responsible current surges, least places. growing underneath surge we're already having. way worse news way, means outgrows strains we'll far bigger problem already do. one bright point mean time vaccination outpace growth. Yeah, that's exactly issue. I'm sort person says things like ""BACON: cure vegetarianism!"". know humans omnivores. But... think okay slaughter animals vanity. That... deal comment. quoting talking points? upset sub isnt doomer used lol Rights intrinsically worthless. value right given determined one giving said rights I'm also part Oxford study! got second shot couple weeks ago. experience symptoms first shot? Two shots least 21 days apart. Unless cross-immunity another pathogen. resistance via lack receptors. Stay safe! That’s true. It’s individual state issue. states getting results right away others aren’t remember getting heavily downvoted saying federal government that's fucked everything far would fuck vacine distribution. original plan 100 million doses arms end December, later watered 20 million. 20 million goal pushed back end first week January (the 10th). noted Courthouse News Service news service primarily focusing civil litigation. current rate isn’t even accurate, even point article? housemate/close friend works restaurant indoor dining. bunch staff came covid, they've shut business 10 days. 

My friend starting experiencing symptoms days ago, I'm really worried him. He's young, he's also going serious health issues right (being screened cancer, white blood cell count really high). Test come back yet doctor sure coronavirus, oxygen levels dropping every day. 

Just really worried friend, i'm pissed serving beer burgers put safety jeopardy. sucks. thought going make pandemic okay, feeling hopeful (vaccine!) happen. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s new different seen previously. fits perfectly. Dude, screw off.

Far hospital workers LTC residents getting vaccinated politicians rich people. well, that's quite accurate..
 
95% 60% efficacy primary data point, preventing symptomatic disease..
 
a vaccine usually manage also reduce severity symptoms hence data point consider like severity disease death, seemed Astrazeneca vaccine good protection severe disease (no severe disease vaccine arm)
 
so like 60% got got standard vaccine 40% got none..
 
and believe pandemic, availability, coverage, speed distributing vaccine also matters, vaccine 60% efficacy excellent protection severe disease save lives compared depend 95% ones.. AZ sent batch vaccine Oxford titer information. Oxford decided would confirm AZ measurement quantified mRNA Nanodrop. gave measurement 2x AZ said. mixup “low first dose” accident happened.   seems like every day there’s another reason we’ll never go back normal, can’t see family another year, on. glimmer hope immediately crushed. I’ve done right thing since March don’t know keep anymore. Like many, depression getting worse day. Normally agree, think exception made case. you’re dipshit directly leads problem believing masks whatever, really deserve back line. busy flying home Vacation. know 😉 profound insight. 

And wish punish mask-less, vaccine-less, covid convicts implied safe anymore. 

Shall felony? willing accept subsequent rise homelessness incarceration rates?

A misdemeanor? Slap silly fines?

How disproportionately affect poorest, vulnerable members society? know, police frequently spotted areas higher crime rates happens places marginilized citizens. Surely, punished caught noncompliance most. 

Or law written punish chosen skin color? Jim Crow likeness? 

I'm curious think, would love hear it. Would police need funding effectively proscribe criminals? 

Just know, wear mask receive vaccine, I'm hopeful works actually. We're even close knowing we're woods yet way. probably even get spring summer, people even access time next year. think we'll better science data know effective isn't. sure, let's make whole framework government policy write new criminal codes right based assumptions. 

And forget mask like once! Could landed dystopian prison would have!  Also Texas, DFW. Bumble match nurse concerned virus all. offered opinion mentioned can't wait get jab fun travelling work pleasure again. ""Ehhhhh I'm worried virus. all."" 

For record, match. search continues. I'm completely making ""black lists"" kind. However, think title bit misleading. making registry people ""reject vaccine"". making registry people vaccine offered. happens person rejected it, also record rejected.

I see different current vaccination card everyone already mandatory voluntary vaccines. Healthcare system already knows vaccinated vaccine. know COVID vaccine different. surprising, matter time. Yep, that's pretty much right, one's complain most/loudest one's ended reason doctors medical staff left first place.

I feel bad partake negative/poor behavior facing unnecessary hardships due neighbors choices actions. someone grows pot state illegal goes prison victim? That's tip iceberg.

What crippling anxieties people created themselves. 

Afraid touch door knobs, hug loved ones, speak close someone, avoid maskless people, ever feel comfortable using public toilet again? crowd bigger 5? countless scenarios situations even mentioned. 

This virus created large subsection agoraphobics. vaccines lightning port require overpriced dongle compatible needles. Many reports show get months, knows soon really I’ve taken vitamin D, zinc, echinacea, multivitamin religiously since March. got COVID November, case extremely mild Millions old people die every year. doubt there's enough death make much change. let close 2% people die off? Cos that's lethal virus US exactly UK , absolute shit show minute. 

Good luck buckle ! don’t know. hope believe certain extend can’t say certain. Yes, true. [But none badly says great deal country given much spent US around five times UK's population - would equivalent ~250k daily cases US don’t know you’re downvoted. I’m Illinois, out-of-state deaths might counted initially numbers, get taken out. least supposed be. Wait, many shots vaccine consist of? Yeah I'm relatively healthy think I'd major issues. I'm cautious, perfect I'm home time. But, know I'm unlucky enough get something severe I'm screwed able get treatment. Couldn’t agree more. think states open age groups general pharmacies things move way faster super worth looking into. think good idea look it.
Currently though get many people's arms can. Yep, caught covid grocery store. lot people speculating widespread US already despite evidence contrary. scarier thing spread we're already seeing original coronavirus, becomes dominant variant things get lot worse.  Smallpox extinct anyways, vaccine pointless.

Something something labs russia US. case need transparency. here's why. stopping it. could contain variant, decide end pandemic? real question state state plan ramp injections? aggregate plans, imply national ramp timeline? operation going full speed, many getting shot daily? analysis - instead pointing fingers.


A slow start big deal, lack ability communicate comes next top-down perspective red alert, sadly expected :( stay inside. may peak/plateau bit January, things get better immunity infections vaccinations start kick in. 

As move towards summer, every day going get better. freedom going taste like honey. Americans reason Chinese-style firewall regulations. Slow steady may win race, handled start big disgrace. City city, state state, way slow vaccinate. cases increase hospitals fill up, pay us $2,000... it’s time put shut up. duh No, masks social distancing won’t stay permanently vaccine widely available, good reason, too. Children typically ones vaccinated. Thats childrens stats important.

Vaccinating children basically mandatory. vaccination likely become mandatory 2021 (given appears wont enough assume French actively seek out). Looking stats, vaccine scepticism doesnt seem extend 60% people actually refusing get vaccinated long tell it. I've mildly sore arm, like Tdap, I've nothing else. Pfizer vaccine people felt crappy days 2-4. moderna, sure, I'll finding tomorrow New Year's day!

After news Luke Letlow dying 41, I'm glad get arm pain... one said didn’t Operation Warp Speed bigliest tremendous beautiful plan ever designed, invoking DPA would admission isn’t working. Can’t that. I'm lucky I'm one least affected areas world. good. field one critical peers. fucks left give go work mode Reddit explanations, fair point though personally okay eligible folks opting vaccine means mine take sooner. hard time believing alone category. hasn’t much genetic sequencing seems two dozen samples tested LA recent weeks zero positive variant, obviously small sample still unlikely result driving surge. mean 0.001% risk healthy young person, even then, going guarantee kill someone.

Listen, going change mind this. vaccine work this, fuck it. Call selfish, care. Life short, might well make it. better getting first dose all. first dose provides quite substantial protection own. I’m health professional, hear good things Vitamin D. NBC news report TikTok video. Period. interviews, input sources.

Slow news day?  sure downvotes, that's thinking well. WISH flies would drop like flies. federal government information effectively. States relevant data populations locations vaccines go received. federal government's job securing even distribution vaccines every state, that. Separation powers United States means healthcare handled state level terms actual logistics, states best positioned that. 

This unified gets without total restructuring separation powers country, massive untertaking. got Yellow fever vaccine pharmacy sat waiting area came checked couple times.  sit you. Ontario finance minister spent Ontario lockdown secretly Caribbean. even pre-recorded messages support local businesses people staying home holidays.  believe following science. Usually safe bet. enough science yet persuade people safe enough take prevent virus high survival rate. thing asking people mask up, avoid crowds, social distance, asking government support people small businesses work theyre superspreader industries. (Commence downvotes and, ""they tested couple months like 40000 people!"" comments) France's lockdown measures thus far joke. say would true talking about, say, Italy, France, actual ""lockdown"" lasted couple weeks. really curfew bar/restaurant/gym closures.

They even bother closing schools ban visits nursing homes.

Impose half-assed lockdown PR reasons destroy public's confidence government anything. officers literally sit day every day? Except epidemiologists [at among places. I'm OP, I'll care share here.

I juvenile myoclonic epilepsy , well controlled taking generic Keppra. warnings medication get says may weaken immune system.

I (30, f) see condition front-runner COVID vaccine.

My six year old, however, cerebral palsy result (malpractice) perinatal stroke (US) birthing process. CP, kiddo seizures cannot controlled well medications, ADHD result seizures, brain damage leaves susceptible future strokes. believe would enough grant vaccine ahead June July, jury still one.

I worry list specific conditions like COPD, HIV, MS, Lupus, etc. would make ineligible. However, also would understand list created, given pressing medical need, continue distance home groceries delivered. living fear, choosing keep loved ones safe.  getting vaccine people fast enough. governor head sand. That's this. Someone to. Hope night gets better.  Lol. 

Wrong. wish someway show video kinds scenes public. know there’s privacy laws sorts issues that. seems really problem regular folk can’t visualize chaos.  people develop fabled skill read lines. u/77449 must able see infinitely tiny print lines single sentence. logical explanation. Blessed her! know 3/4 people. that's mainly mum works healthcare colleagues older etc vaccinated level premeditation deception truly amazing....as evidenced dec 24 video article. Ivanka essentially control messaging CDC? Imagine scientist explaining genetics her?  Holy shit number insane 2 2020 4 2021: Antigenic Drift nothing America. There's bottleneck vaccine production worldwide. many vaccines distributed many exist.

The US vaccinations country far know. country ahead vaccine purchasing. Texas, restaurants still open dine in. one cares. people's genetics can't handle it, healthy not, unfortunately lottery something change little extra healthy. 

Plus talking odds surviving, potential hospitalization medical bills. Small irony NBA currently playing without bubble Gift shop mainly visitors buy presents patient visiting. 15 I've heard National Guard used supplement nurses hospitals (or least plans so) states. Even they're trained nurses, help certain tasks like proning patients (turning beds promote better breathing). Thing Harris politics long enough know media teist words something make headlones. yes irresponsible especially global pandemic really need many people possible take vaccine offered it. would conclude 501Y.V viruses currently rare US they're circulating responsible recent surges. 

If I’m reading correctly say low rates genetic sequencing hasn’t circulating widely, ruling possibility isolated cases became concern. Seeing thousands cases London November would seem reasonable presume people US since then. Damn that's young No, one unified response would distribution plan every state. Anything involves government stopping saying “okay guys figure now” half assed job. Crazy Who's ""they""? federal government? states making decisions. state plan. Refer state's website press briefings information state's plan. wait, it’ll everywhere time🤦‍♂️ vacancy rate around 4.3% Manhattan. typically around 2-3%. people moved transplants temporarily. Wise words  literally 200k cases nationwide today. rate going we'll natural herd immunity vaccines even made dent...  dad got today, wife gets tomorrow. healthcare workers, thankful excited first shot board. slightly sore arm effect I’ve experienced, small price pay. get strain/variant vaccine work on, bet we'll see people get fed point. One year lock downs adjusting lives hard, second third year...yeah people going listen guidelines. Heck, tons people acting like nothing wrong moment. mean us got sick spring/summer Covid, likely “reinfected” since it’s different variant? I’ve locked hella hard since February (working home, hypochondriac 
 this, great combo) anxious. already anxious reinfection different variants really scare :/ President Elect Harris?  also funny consider majority us uave vaccinated atleast lives. trying ""that guy"". wanted point since lot people sub sat college bio class.

Happy holidays stay safe

P.s. ever see correct typo... Smack 666 deaths reported Skane since start pandemic. monday Sonesson said Skane 774 deaths. 

My 300 guess reported tomorrow whole Sweden. leaving.

So stayed watch burn? Influenza doesn’t work like that. Neither small pox. HIV, Ebola. longer prodromal period person becomes symptomatic, continue spread easily still kill host found 2-3 hosts (R0 3.3 without considering née variants) long take Measles much contagious.....yea going happen. Except elderly havr underlying medical conditions put risk really need then. Biden getting completely understand considering guys like 78 he's high risk think Kamla Harris actually high risk dying covid What’s best way help frontline healthcare workers? would like help (food, money, whatever needed most) sure would actually help? kids gonna get opportunities never had!

Like chance get polio! Oh nice, agreed top comment, doesn’t feel like it’s three weeks since first vaccine first person die US - 57yr old healthy woman - co-morbidities - suffered thought heart attack immune system wee bit different. I've read many reports people's immune system ""over reacting"" (mine bit gives ton allergies). 

For her, ""The immune system attacking virus attacking virus, damaged heart heart basically burst.""  vaccines bought distributed federal government. one unified response. 10 months learn use database internet, 30 year old technology. Well, know 💯 children contract covid issues road. know. There's couple studies show takes toll them. Inflammatory markers. know Pelosi would agree 1.8 trillion dollar stimulus offered accepted 900 billion “because different president” right?  EXACT words. cares politics people. wealth concentrated hands few. Sorry, mean sound cruel, I'm pessimistic Biden actually capable improving situation faith humanity taken massive hit. Nurses?

Every person dies going according plan. someone explain pop hospitals sat empty March? underprepared? 8 months prepare knowing winter going disaster. Reacting fact. Ridiculous really. People young kids left could work home wanted space. Oxford saying waiting 2-3 months doses increase protective effects significantly. hope study vaccines. It’s help collect raw materials, administration recently agreed help one producers help speed production get vaccines quicker.

They can’t build entire new vaccine production facility vaccines, it’s “new” tech 3 days, huh? Interesting. Israel they're using army vaccinate people. thing. many negative posts here. goal. ambition one well. US vaccinated country. think Israel ahead US per capita basis. mentioned times count probably lagging due reporting delays. either way amount people vaccinated day keep going up. like testing. effects old people underlying conditions /s

So sad. Maybe wake people (unlikely). Dude age similar aged kids. Terrifying. don’t disagree. also giving governors pass, could done more. 

In Ohio, live, Mike Dewine talking using guard months this, he’s nothing. YMMV.

I basically friends. Nobody family works healthcare lives nursing home, nobody got vaccinated. Thank everything you’re doing.

I co-publish indie magazine amplifying short accounts pandemic wondering might interested sharing this?  anyone else getting sinking feeling may’ve optimistic get vaccine? hoping March, April latest, it’d publicly available all. I’m starting realize us non-essentials going get later that?   I’ll either get shot hospital school America. *There appears investment plan last mile,” tweeted Ashish Jha, dean Brown University School Public Health. “No effort Feds help states launch real vaccination infrastructure. Feds know vaccines coming? Shouldn’t planning around vaccination sites, etc happened October November?”* Really? seen rumors know that's actually playing out. You’re idiot. Truly. It’s shown efficacy single dose. Even singe dose help. Yes two doses better. first dose heavy lifting. Bullshit. needs massive federal undertaking. States don’t resources get done.

*There appears investment plan last mile,” tweeted Ashish Jha, dean Brown University School Public Health. “No effort Feds help states launch real vaccination infrastructure. Feds know vaccines coming? Shouldn’t planning around vaccination sites, etc happened October November?”* Agreed. think branching conservative conspiracy subs. That’s also lifetime immunity most, doesn’t seem expectation COVID vaccines. surge hospital opened NYC enforced criteria receiving patients narrow hardly utilised despite massive need. good today explained podcast set procedural issues. ... really know difference? Can’t argue data! idea dosage number state accounts single dose counting complete two part vaccine “dose”?m

For instance shows NY 900,000 doses ability fully vaccinate 450,000 people? what? 

There fast spreading virus year now. went single case global pandemic months. Almost 0 countries succesful getting control, containing even slowing spread. Especially USA dealt terribly.

Now turns there's variant spreads even quicker. see detecting early would mattered. measures would apply would still ignored much. really hate word cull. doesn’t sound fucked enough is. Thank you!

Do think chance vaccines offer much longer protection? looking vaccine people get every year? 2 words... viral load literally admitted lied order save PPE health care workers. OK admit something wrong. 
Also, let know, misused jury still phrase. said ""jury still out"" clearly meant say ""jury still out."" know 7 would really nice. Man, hope EU gets act together. 

At least know doses go unused. EU want them, guess countries, including US, take them. Seems like CDC models try account this. found interesting read. Love visual :)

Luckily it’s extent dosage, since unlike virus, mRNA way reproduce cause even cell death.  Compared vaccines, simply walking bedroom bathroom likely kills cells (don’t quote that, trying illustrate scale) always thought Spirulina would nice girl's name think they're recommending going 1 dose. They're advocating using doses come in, time 2nd dose use newly arrived ones those. expecting deliveries drop time goes on, saving makes sense. deliveries ramping time (which case here), seems overly paranoid hold back half doses.

So Canada's case, they've gotten 250K Pfizer doses December, expect 750K January, 3M February March. face that, provinces holding back half doses seems kind silly. would essentially vaccinating 50% people otherwise could (most high risk) protect chance something completely catastrophic happening supply chain January. risk/reward make lot sense that's (or maybe even all) provinces opted use doses arrive. Based delivery estimates, actual deliveries could come 50-70% lower expected could still give everyone 2nd dose time. Thank you’re doing.

I copublish indie magazine sharing short stories everything going on. wondering might share comment? Stop using fur, stop eating wild animals, Ice Age anymore. Damn looks old, sure hope issue something else keel everyone go crazy trying cover anything vaccine anything it. Much like nurse fainted Tenn fact btw faint. hope too, need make lost summer year. Jabbing arms distribution. sit freezers get administered. always many vaccines sitting freezers administered. That's ramping distribution works definition.

These vaccines sitting around nothing. Seems almost like must use similar tactics profession got cocky.

like every TV hospital show seems show it, ever stuck hospital someone hours hours days, start memorize entire gift shop inventory. completely clueless terms healthcare actually operates. federal government run healthcare. funds (via Medicare Medicaid insurance). That's extent involved. absolutely capable anything help states. federal government insurance company. States actually manage healthcare systems relevant resources data so. 

You've made parallel universe exist. US top-down country one government. powers resources delegated states. throwing platitudes without understanding real world. long touting Operation Warp Speed? think end goal buy bunch vaccines wait around states tell sent? months make sure states distribution plans place. Obviously didn’t bother that. It’s failure leadership, period. federal government isn’t going know specifics Florida’s vaccines need distributed. Know make sure of? Florida fucking plan place. every state. isn’t blue natural disaster, it’s going months.

But sure yep, everything could possibly done, gave 110%, sure defining characteristic administration! like everything else they’ve done it’s mismanaged clusterfuck put forth minimum required effort immediately shifted blaming everyone else things went wrong. Hmm sounds bit brand. Wrong dosing:

Donald Trump fucked up. 

But also every single Governor too. realized 8-months ago own, working roll got here. 

Lots states said going use national guard, far none have. 

They’ve dropped ball. Even sadder is, tons people still deny existence pandemic refuse follow rules ... probably get much worse gets better Bravo. Upvoted! Pretty sure expression ""dropping like flies"" always though, especially symptoms delayed. Coronavirus much slower onset symptoms flu serious diseases like ebola.

Good news, given Mask compliance US, example, consistently 80-90%. Quit spreading smug meme. Facts matter right?  Omg....this sad. think Microsoft Winsows 10? production ramping theoretically available 30 days time 2nd shot going route done correctly. think guys slow. Guess many people France vaccinated far? 100. that’s last 3 days. New Zealand  even full numbers year already highest murder rate since 2011. know much trouble politely admitting fact wrong. texted back died. Man, year sucks. Newsom sucks ass. agenda 21? Esoteric agenda? Whats name now?xD Ha - know apparently rant staged, right? try can. already reality check her. bring covid-19? back rethoric.. point is...ITS ENOUGH INEQUALITY WASTEFUL CIVILIZATION...we want type 1 civ  years I’ve going MinuteClinics CVS operates get diagnoses treatments illnesses like strep throat, get flu shot. Never problem always timely manner. definitely agree: CVS, Walgreens, etc., would great giving COVID vaccines. permanent damage? severe death, cool. Nevada specifically? Holy shit. That's terrible. ☹️ Right?

I proud CA’s response beginning, I’m let down. aggressive early worked! like...a hundred cases. 40k cases day, 3k city, it’s like...no big deal, business usual, even though hospitals zero capacity.

It’s baffling. hadn’t heard that. link study? Unless small number countries, leave country already long you’re going somewhere that’s accepting foreigners.  Biden basically Jesus people isn’t he? truly think one person going singlehandedly wave wand magically better? Oh man. hope friend okay. use term losely. live comfortably live paycheck paycheck.

No, 2020 easy year. Far it. Mental health huge problem house many others like it. We've wrecked planet... long term plans beyond 1/2 generation. Greed selfishness control. Plain simple, right? Party 12 French Laundry (easily $600+ per person wine) real
Slap face Precisely, people CDC need fix little data bottleneck problem PRONTO they’re going angry mob hands. think need one maybe cases strain spread control. Also, soon detect first case, probably spread well beyond already, unless test everybody every single day. surprised turns strain start UK, UK first country detect it.

I think many lives would saved identified earlier. However, agree even lives saved would worth it. called 2 week vacations 5 sick days getting sick vacation.if cold symptoms, worth calling get something worse remember vaccinated, must mean vaccines wiped memory too! 😱😱 also lack personnel take care beds. build field hospitals want staff them. wouldn’t surprised anomaly real data accidentally getting holiday. Florida messing numbers since day one. family member works popular restaurant Miami’s city limits 16 people Covid. Employees don’t put masks customers walk restaurant. Obviously anecdotal, tracks reports crowded, maskless bars restaurants State. 

So possible Florida far looser laws California, numbers significantly lower? tracking projects California invaded officials wielding guns stealing computers. 

Weird, right? wish case countries stop spread, way instill fear selfish idiots Good luck, Tulum huge outbreak. Friend lives there, precautions. That's simply true. [The peak cases day right cases increasing consistently then. ton reporting effects around time took catch up. Christmas,[ peak week holiday itself. bad time consuming idea. setup, shot wait, trying match people's schedule makes way time consuming. research subject truly adequate research intelligent mind. someone want get vaccine mean intelligent, could mean bought media hype. Nevertheless, time tell, intelligence slices whole, whole yet come 18% get claim vaccine useless get disease went away anyways. think US brewed mew variant, didn’t know, NOTHING CHECK! sounds like great step forward! Good proactive despite feeling bad. Wishing best. Tell me, color sky world live in?

None things suggesting based reality. should. really like writing. know 2% population literally means millions dead right?  US CBP allow people leave country either negative test first well. 2 questions could answering here. first question is, UK variant exist US rare handful cases. question, think correct number tests done make difficult determine that. However, question, one raised thread, whether UK variant might driving California surge. that, think even relatively low number sequences done, statistically enough would've expected find least one variant way driving surge. would rather 0% immunity rather 55 85% immunity 95 percent immunity later? They're even banning nursing home visitation. describes statistical methods uses (Jeffreys binomial proportion confidence interval) results (95% confidence intervals 0-5% 53 CA samples, 0-2% U.S's 112 samples) tweets 5 &amp; 6. math back feeling ""definitely nowhere near enough find significant statistical trends""? *is* significant statistical trend. intuitions often run far astray statistics: takes many fewer samples would expect converge reasonable confidence intervals. weather change; allowed out....until September vote not.. much wonderful people Sooo you’re saying we’re stuck ... people convinced vaccine actually man made nanovirus gives AIDS, acts GPS, controlled Donald Trump. 

Sometimes question enjoy epidemiology much. 😔 Ideology facts country ended shitter begin with. Well, get think that’s stupid truth leadership matters. governor doesn’t seem give shit, you’ll see many start giving shit. ruined wasting vaccine Israel they're using army vaccinate people. thing.

Israel faces existential threat since mortal enemies 6 minutes away air. Failure option.

Meanwhile US atlantic pacific oceans heavy lifting, government gotten soft weak since end World War II. 27 Million Americans uninsured -- dispute that's high, **most** Americans type insurance, even absolute shittiest health insurance cover things like flu shots cheaper paying hospital stay. means chance dying catch new previous variant. Thank much explanation hope family stay safe!  call bs. going prime worse outbreaks different viruses future. Glimmer light? follow rules science trying dig us out. Respectfully, sir, ourselves, everyone still travels see family xmas. thing exponential stupidity. respectful opinion There's handy ad end order vitamin C. :( new data...is it...common sense? Isreal already vaccinated 5% population. usa would mean 16 millions kind makes sense - homeless folks generally jobs, can't afford eat out, go gym, welcome lot stores. Ninety-nine percent time, really sucks... *But,* right now, served keep away lot places virus spreading like wildfire. old normal led mess

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* interesting comment. thinking lately son 3 got chicken pox first MMR vaccination second MMR vaccine. end sight, crossed finish line. husband unfortunately gotten COVID would wish anyone. hope last vaccinated, assume must still antibodies left. TIL shots UK called “jabs.” could like flu shots updated every season. thing scientists guess virus based coronaviruses done. assumptions hurt us, early many epidemiologists skeptical asymptomatic spread respiratory virus, none previously ever behaved way. 

No one knows ends. mask you, it’s around you. That’s primary function. data showed mildly effective filtering stuff yourself, first foremost it’s don’t spread ickies far away you. Immunity means likely get sick won’t experience symptoms (in vast majority cases). 

We still don’t know vaccine anything prevent carrier spreading disease. Usually do, don’t know yet.

Here literature might help: tell wife everyday. Last November another virus China. ruined world economy next 10 years. Lack leadership public figures aggravated situation, still spiraling downwards. Ok put way, definitely. referring vaccine. quite people claiming we’re gonna fucked years come mutation. spread fear anxiety. Except nothing. 9 million doses sitting freezers people's arms end week though I'll glad stand corrected. rate, entire country vaccinated &lt;crunches 2027! even unpack?! Could taught vaccinate ourselves? Would speed things up? probably much like virus spread certain populations result people still don’t know many people it. Likewise, vaccine mostly distributed people upper middle middle class circles part. such, don’t know doctors, nurses, pharmacists, aren’t likely know someone vaccinated. new variant cause deaths? No

If transmissible cause deaths, means variant must less lethal.. There's evidence this. COVID, transmissible, deaths cases. Fatality rates could apparently reduced taken account vaccine allocation.

Of course know be. So, hypothetically speaking. Oxford, JnJ, Moderna vaccines. Probably cannot Pfizer though. Im glad people getting vaccinated *at all*

For months nothing bad news promise solution way, least see *glimmer* light end tunnel.

Just didnt achieve goal doesnt mean good. Yes also hard people actually quarantining because...the last thing want go store around dozens (hundreds?) people. count number people outside immediate household I've interacted face-to-face last 9 months one hand, literally choice.

Trump destroyed chance going smoothly. Biden's immediate plan keep everything closed September 2021, work like hell get vaccines way possible (including free door-to-door vaccinations anyone wants go route). Thank thank thank &lt;3 know probably doesn’t mean much, know lots us hunkered many months grateful work every single day, personal sacrifices (and families) make. Thank you, hang there. low-key hope experiences extreme psychotic- zombie like effects. Worst pandemic century miracle cure, buy it. Changing behaviors cure, stuff gonna make worse future would contribute lower numbers, higher. Grandparents got last week. Yeah... hard include data year end year dingus. person sees bullshit. Layers manipulation every facet lives. people act surprised beyond me. Why? I’m lawyer works finance. would know 2-3 healthcare workers? debunked many times now? I've read something like, ""scientists reason believe vaccines effective new strains.""

Which reminds used say, ""scientists know recovering Covid-19 leaves unable become infected again.""

And, ""scientists reluctant say whether Covid-19 become endemic."" think Fauci saying last week, likely single dose would effective young healthy people. Older populations absolutely require 2nd dose. tried getting job large company offers group life insurance? know common is, company it, we're exactly bursting benefits otherwise. required get shots little kid started public school went University California schools BA Masters. think one meningitis hepatitis B Tetanus, TB test. attended grad school, get like three vaccines one, forgot diseases for? Vaccinations apparently taken seriously state perhaps states?

For whatever reason, never got chicken pox vaccine kids nowadays ended contracting virus age 6 stay home school whole week. excited go school allowed play Sonic Hedgehog everyday hated welts body. Thankfully mom put cream stuff make itchy feeling go away. Fuck no, tired 1. want end. Thanks much this! California never leader anything. think planning apply approval mid/late Jan, hopefully getting approval early/mid Feb [Check understand coming from, usually case. People age usually survive. However, headline this, virus taken seriously enough people go day contracting spreading..Hopefully finding one unlucky ones like young woman. virus care came from. 

If jar 100 jelly beans knew 99 safe, one would absolutely kill you... would still risk it? Hell no. That's important. Especially since add underlying conditions, vitamin deficiencies extra weight, number poisonous jelly beans increases. news, year covid, next month December expected named January.

Yes, nothing changed here. Considering it’s 2 weeks since first dose administered US passed 5 million, don’t think we’re going hit number. Ahhhhh, get point now. thought answering lol. Christ [this like Mt Everest next two foot hills someone says ""x caused y"" deflection- tendentious otherwise- ask x caused y. literally idea life like. could limited work multitude reasons working something better, point don’t know it’s business.

Almost every story like Fauci ""but things bad"" info it, never put headline. people understandably read full story publishers know that. know 'if bleeds, leads'. shit horrific enough present, still this.

Although process general population start April/May sure  One thing see changing increase working home telecommuting rather offices. Less travel work would good lot things... commercial property. we'll see plays out. Definitely! hope Government subsidize cannot afford flu vaccine. correct balance.  much government involvement stray market hurt communities well.  

I think intelligent thing pick choose things handled well market things need partnership.  frankly things best left government themselves.

Right see republican party ideology real problem common sense thinking.

They apply ideology three concepts really work one half them.

I think moderate left trying find balance.  think progressive left moving far balance direction.

Which call moderate lefty. do, 3 frontline workers.  dont worry positive long chinese government - case bunch bots come upvote presume speak anyone yourself. OWS it? Pfizer BioNTech developed independently. Jesus Christ. sensational headline site full worst ads ever. what, exactly? explain. logic, men among others, women saying home cooking taking care kids. world still like discussed months ago. turns myocarditis common amongst people viral infections.

Makes sick hear words. Sadly it’s lead contact relationship called ignorant. can’t believe people still think fake, judging people right thing....helping keep safe. Well assume “this mess” meant covid .... Stop focused 7 day moving avg. highest daily increase Thanksgiving one week 20th 200k cases. dropped drastically went slightly right Thanksgiving. like Christmas see peak week before. 

I tend think fact similar coincidence patterns reporting happens around holidays, patterns pretty similar. shape graph almost exactly same. 3-6 months bed rest normal, strenuous activity lead inflammation, create scar tissue heart muscle, permanent. serious cases though surgery may required. brother got 5 years ago bacterial infection, needed open heart surgery replace valve heart heart valve pig. takes aLOT meds he's ok.  
TL;DR: permanent damage heart? maybe. Permanent damage bank account? maybe You’re brainwashed. guess, could homeless actually get vitamin sun. Ooo sub going like post, even perfectly accurate across board. Especially bringing Fauci lying. really hate that. protest signs say? fake talking Microsoft 365. would reduced hours holiday weekend possibly skew PERCENTAGE positive tests? doesn’t even make sense. Reduced testing hours weekend could potentially increase TOTAL number positives reported Monday, PERCENT samples test positive is. Lol, literally none wrote true. Mass availability vaccine general public track spring, dingus. Dude years time we’re gonna see many stories gofundmes people tossed insurance/denied insurance due long term covid symptoms.

The people downvoting probably people think m4a wouldn’t work. know 1, maybe more. Nah. Keep calm carry on. completely expected billions take measures reduce spread instead wiping like China. sets perfect environment virus evolve virility.

We'll beat anyway 2021. mentioned 2 spirted? when? 

oh right 2S. THATS SAID say that? said tracked it. Learn read comprehend reading come anyone. teachers adults, tho... Please insult 14 year old girls way. 
I know petulant brats he. family lives Alabama live California. placed back stay home orders, Alabama’s governor lifted restaurant 100% capacity. Even fine, know spread might fine. biggest problem here. Well, it’s good thing Warp Speed vaccine. many deaths stops sensationalism report COVID deaths starts tragedy you? might qualify saying get infected breaks lunches together cars. Seattle far north get enough sunshine manufacture vitamin another months. People live supplement half year. clinical trials efficacy show delayed second dose beyond 30 day mark still good? 9 million unused vaccine. 1947 nyc vaccinated 5 million people 2 weeks small pox. 70 years later. year plan this

I hope things change like rest response covid everything seem disorganized Tendentious deflection. Idk downvotes. aint wrong terrible animal food market conditions... terrible things other... give f*ck. Us humans want live... shown centuries anything get there... Including kill anything/anyone. worry. Biden put everything behind us move sake unity. Well preexisting conditions? necessary, work hospital unit anything covid part day day go ER week much real see staff walking around looks like hazmat suits giants face masks. one thing know whole see it. inferred based quickly prevalence rises respect established strain. hard imagine scenario completely eradicate covid 19 continue living normally covid 19. really stuck hard situation. Drastic times mean drastic measures. vaccine help lot, everyone going take it, even 100 percent people vaccinated could still remain animal reservoirs.

It much smaller issue, people could still getting Covid years. takes long time eradicate disease. ""exploding"" meaning still like 1/10th infection least infected city US lol. took flight South Korea today spray sanitize whole plane everything airport like every couple hours. basically sterile environment there's literally like 25 ppl aboard plane meant 300. Air travel Korea safer ever frankly, get here, people fucking around. thing talking US Coronavirus spreads much easily Aerosol behaves differently drier, colder temps even drier heated air indoors. Cases exploding merely people quarantine-fatigued, also seasonal conditions. least friend self-aware thoughts irrational subsided. take care 82-year-old also noticed completely edge slightest thing sorts normally way — isolation taking toll sure. chance death + transmissible = cases = deaths. Yeah dont really get pulling 98.3% rate sort silver lining? Like fucking low man. rips company 500 people 7 8 die??? fuck idiots on?  believed since catching small glimpses bad Italy. get it, HIPAA, privacy, yada yada yada. there’s time rubbing people’s noses it. time nine months ago also now. you’re confusing immunity illness contagiousness. You’re immune suffering illness; yet know also prevents spreading virus others it’s fought body immunity. 

I suggest least surface level research call people hypocrites internet. Sooo selfish business owners going business employees getting laid governors giving shut orders go partying themselves. gonna go back forth you. Humanity won’t distance forever people can’t take vaccine. Like said earlier (before replied mods deleted posts), don’t sense you’re willing discuss civil manner I’m going end argument here. Take easy Oof. wish best stay safe healthy.  welcome. real though dm zoom link hang out. pacific time flexible. lonely everyone connection important. Twitch streaming sounds fun awesome willing stream relative strangers! fun it? friend LA, neighbor doctor, covid, told stay home lack hospital beds. estimate saw first dose gets 90% protection second dose 95%.

Seems would way better 100 million people 90% protected 50 million people 95% protected! Plus, seems likely getting second dose 12 months later still get extra bit protection, delaying, foregoing.

To clear, early result, favor research, seems really likely way go. rolling 7day average positivity rate around Probably. Oh sub going react? Probably something like:

Makes sense, think. I'm currently uninsured know get COVID, I'm going die home. Nutmeg keeps insisting posting nonsense like “the virus won’t mutate” bc doesn’t care truth, right “do want”.

He alt accounts aren’t discussing good faith.

Reality: virus keeps spreading non-sterilizing vaccine great conditions mutate escape it’s effects. much higher short order. Time real. Try 5 gram dose Psilocybin mushrooms understand lol pace continue, pandemic would continue 2021. stop complaining? Science Behind Coronavirus Affects Brain | allow make assertions variant rampant California weeks discovery? slightly unethical line work, no? rate November would've taken unlimited amount time Americans adequately vaccinated agaisnt Covid. Viruses genome. 

You collect RNA samples sick person. purify sample RNA. use commercially-prepared proteins called reverse transcriptases convert RNA DNA code. use DNA polymerases amplify amount DNA have. chop DNA fragments using commercially-prepared proteins called restriction enzymes. run fragments device called sequencer sequence code individual fragment. computer use overlapping fragments sequenced sections stich together complete genome. know human genome looks like, get rid computer. What's left viral genome. 

We take viral genome compare existing viral genomes file look differences. 30,000 bases Covid-19 genome (In DNA, base pairs C, G, A, T. single stranded RNA (ssRNA) individual bases - C, G, A, U). 

Viruses, tend mutate relatively quickly 30,000 bases, sure differences samples. Thing is, either silent (as different RNA bases code amino acids proteins) changes produce major difference shape function output proteins. even make virus less virulent.

Using epidemiological data, track ones common sicker people and/or spreading faster. use depth computational study function new code. determine part genome corresponds type protein, put expected amino acid sequence computer program predicts folding peptide strands subsequently shape finished protein. predict function (things like well spike protein bind ACE2).

Never. say wasn’t evidence human human transmission    Still laser focus children? looking see long term trends adults also taken consideration?

I'm agreeing disagreeing France's historical position vaccines (I know enough say either way), I'm pointing using vaccination rates single vaccine subset population exactly rock solid evidence argument. media outlets Eff already Yeah, current pace pissing off. numbers lower reality unknown degree take face value, people getting infected vaccinated every day still.  South Africa's press summary: based preliminary data South African variant, spreads faster (as also reported UK variant). Additionally, anecdotal data suggests higher proportion younger people, also ones without comorbidities, become ill. data South African variant still preliminary, confirmed could cause serious problems. necessarily. first one seems infecting people fine is. think Outbreak real life monkeys escaped lab vials COVID-19 test samples. remember staring iPad mouth hanging open like, “That happen”.

Christmas lot us gathered groups - start getting sick soon tragically die around 17th-20th January (those die covid-19 typically die 11 days severe symptoms). mid-January would expect deaths taper little overall trend upwards longer period vaccine measures take effect.  believe current understanding higher infectivity related ACE2 affinity, absolutely could caused higher lethality (which didn't). Mutations decreasing lethality increasing infectivity correlated, there's reason expect effects one mutation follow rules. notice Dr. Gabriel Leung's team Hong Kong estimate new variant 70%-80% infectious.

I'm hoping get data done testing. F I'm glad anyone vaccines right depressing slow rollout is. Vaccinating million people week, we've far, mean it'll take quite long time vaccinate everyone. hope vaccine rollout speed soon. sure end January they'll long-term care facilities done residents staff too.

That's nearly ambitious enough though. end January aiming people 65 want vaccine vaccinated. I'm sure read it, post version flu shot called Flublok, made Sanofi. seem confused talking new Covid vaccines post flu shot. Flublok recombinant vaccine, made eggs live virus, mRNA. Three years ago living near notorious homeless hang Seattle. grocery store hotbed drug sales, parking lot never less 4-5 people possessions them. building shared bathrooms would often come post carrier something use shower/restroom including towel left out. made mistake wrapped towel around noticed damp distinct smell human funkus mine. lived place less 3 months got ungodly bad dry cough (shortly unfortunate tow experience) month saw doctor. immediately dropped nose light thing, backed up, put mask said ""oh wow, that's lot virus"" know coronavirus, rhinovirus, what, fucking cough took 47 days get over. doubt people living streets Seattle seen real nasty viral shit. would bet frequent infections like one got three years ago built sort immunity viruses, good chance spreading, killing hospitalizing population extent. also population that's hard get solid numbers on, always move. hard thing deal with, hope there's silver lining suffering sort immunity. think poorly worded comment means long it, that's real gamble immunity.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* parent France never big vaccination.

France big vaccination. mandatory. Clearly vaccine hesitancy though. Otherwise wouldnt need me. Vaccine hesitancy far higher vaccine established ones like measles. Tell specifically wrong. research portions can't explained trails huge pauses mistaken dosages. statements correct AZ heavy scrutiny. *Mandalorian left chat* feel Dad. OCD much worse now. thank god that. saw idiot subreddit claiming US hospitals never get overwhelmed like Italy China, one month ago. cool, may ask got involved trials? uuuh? frontline health care workers, government, seniors. general public gets later. We’re one top nations testing, we’ve already sourced vaccinations nations, started vaccination process earlier nations. It’s great situation like better Realistically, odds favor. sucked marched Zoom! shit good news? Maybe blocks transmission halts spread corona hope normal april may. know much take.

Jaynes actually talk postal inspector instead received information chain communication included fellow officer involved raid another Kentucky police department, investigation found . department-wide email, obtained Courier-Journal , Gentry wrote attempted firings result “nearly completed” internal investigation whether officers involved Taylor’s death violated force’s policies. Living perpetual lockdown would unrealistic. imagine we'll end treating new flu become endemic. welp, looks like worst corona yet come. reduces it, would nice already.

Even without, restrictions get lifted everyone chance get vaccine.  isn’t answer Checks out. Thanks.

Still touch issue vaccine hesitancy general French population. us smart science this? choosing moderna Pfizer? take get choice one have? true level. ridiculous. see new episodes coming nobody wearing masks social distancing. fair, still know side effects, weather safe various age groups. English language google gave number test results reported really 50% lower usual, it’s likely remaining tests coming places like hospitals even people going way get tested b/c symptoms push positivity rate.

But it’s really easy figure see results look like next week on. live attenuated vaccine certain (extremely rare) instances vaccine derived polio live attenuated vaccine. person receives vaccine one gets sick either - someone unvaccinated comes contact excrement get polio.

The developed world largely abandoned attenuated polio vaccine favor inactivated vaccine.

You cannot get polio polio vaccine developed country, even third world country unlikely. shut Tom Cruise blew up, EP everytime shut cost fortune. crew members fired set following guidelines. taking lot serious businesses. Welcome holiday rerun hell, extended edition! see that? LTC residents vaccinated first. vaccine takes 4-6 weeks become effective, can't healthcare long priority line part medical care. likely get sicker die, get vaccines first regardless stupid are. It’s ethically fucked way. sure lower transmission rate. don’t know much yet. symptoms won’t coughing such. won’t much transmission. scientists saying vaccine doesn’t take zero transmission likely different many people expected. time die.. busy fighting covid get pneumonia vaccine? Huh. know 💫 variant detected UK. Cutting travel late also ""you smelt it, dealt it."" got notification state's notify app potential exposure. Luckily since left house weeks, exposure date 26th, know must triggered neighbor(apartments) visitor one neighbors. notification triggers positive person shares code issued state health, another app places GPS locations long enough period time within expected contagious time frame. 

Honestly impressed even neighbors app willing notify since happen live antimask area. source that? great start need expedite vaccination NY. mean, considering world ditched travel bans long time ago, would say it’s strict, it’s draconian. 

Absolutely though, essential travel work permitted. However, replying point made travelling ‘fun’. It’s essentially impossible right since March currently Swedish deaths per day peaked (hopefully plateau) around 80+ per day.

Swedish reporting deaths really weird hard understand numbers accurate go back like 5-10 days extrapolate bit. 

So high 200 also low 200/6 days. Yes, could 10x higher. ground zero new virus testing kits ready supply even reliable yet, nobody idea did.

Also everyone gets tested possibly even quarantined production, wear masks unless camera, sometimes even camera (for shows use COVID plot line, etc.). camera crew also wearing masks sometimes additional face shields. TV production much safer say, mall grocery store, since tests and/or quarantines 99.9% guarantee one set it, precautions sanitation mask wearing camera account 0.1%. Exactly. That's point.

Rapid testing, typically antigen-based, highly specific, meaning positives positive, low sensitivity, meaning negatives might falsely negative. Negative rapid tests confirmed PCR there's possibility positive, point year always. Or, skip rapid go full PCR wait days.

A negative rapid treated true negative probably one many massive contributing factors blew stupidly. hard contain pandemic diagnostic information contradicts clinical actuality.

Which curious thread. anecdotal, I've also heard many times. ***CAN'T*** say anything ***BAD*** ~~Saturnalia~~ Christmas\* even though co-opted people admit zero significance beliefs still insist celebrating reasons.

Those reasons look like idiots telling people certain someone's birthday centuries.

I say though, celebrating lie par course. start war ~~lies~~ Christmas\*.   Mutations spike allow bond easily, meaning infection lighter viral load. obligatory /s really obligatory cases.

Well, let ruin joke explaining it.

Yes, sarcasm tag obligatory *some* cases. Note jirenlagen mentioned rabies, ""side effect"" used. joke, irony supposed situation. used something else side effect, said second dose caused herpes AIDS, probably would used sarcasm tag. used side effect related covid (like pneumonia respiratory failure), would definitely used sarcasm tag...but said rabies, obviously absurd side effect.

Also, whole thread already tongue-in-cheek. journalists got degree devry already Covid? article:

The Colorado State Laboratory confirmed notified Center Disease Control (CDC) case. 

The individual male 20s currently isolation Elbert County travel history, according press release state. Stop spamming this. everything right, got chummy China . upsetted US politicized like politicize everything can't scientists , doctors medical experts control that's US today worst COVID infected nation world.

Meanwhile east, many countries (Singapore, Taiwan , China, HK , Vietnam, Japan, Australia, NZ, SKorea) followed WHOs COVID advisories (mask wearing, mass testing, quarantine, contact tracing shutdowns).

Meanwhile US CDC rejected test kits methods, insisted failed basically went whole month without testing critical first month COVID arriving US. (source : Totally Control hulu documentary) that’s soreness, whenever get flu shots thing arizona. Hard get tested. want hide truth conflicts hoax/flu narrative. 


They got Xmas mail delivered though, got going them. plan depends 100% compliance kinda seems like shitty plan far know, enough vaccines everyone, get (free) flu shot risk, means 70+ and/or certain chronic health conditions (neither applies me). people receive invitation flu shot every year. Sometimes get employer (you know, want call sick) I've heard anything year, presumably people working home guess want people come flu shot give everyone COVID 😉 Lol, electoral votes certified vp Pence. Procedurally would unlikely surprises. Expect much ranting trump Twitter, lol. team genomically sequenced cases Snohomish County late february, tying original case late January. good science.

I assumed new strain responsible big-city outbreaks we've seen. wrong. That's now.

Well hope never get COVID allow ""wing it"", Oxford informed MHRA dosing error, allowed continue trial lower dose increase risk. Yes are. Figure Covid means might understand.  would mean reap benefits Brexit dividend another 12 months /s Likely many comments assume basis Introduce increasingly damaging restrictions. government subsidizing difference. Without part B can't really part A.

At point lose toe lose leg. going Singapore one away. According Oxford efficacy paper, half dose / full dose regime 90% efficacy symptoms 59% efficacy asymptomatic infections, sterilising immunity far I'm aware, would stop transmission. Bodes well vaccines similar efficacy symptoms. I’m royally fucked feel anymore tired already do. I’m movie. Fro indoor homeless population? people can't take it? Pregnant women people allergies advised take it. 

The vaccine part solution. part making tests available everyone wants one making testing mandatory travel. source this? thought asymptomatic people could infectious.. least people infectious symptomatic  know makes contagious? Living surfaces longer, staying air longer, I'm guessing? people contracting even masks distancing?  everyone aware of, unfortunately. Here's thought then, maybe message would better directed towards people insist ""waiting"" years get vaccinated getting vaccine (and believe I've seen people here) instead toward people plan getting vaccine soon can. It’s fun games tyrants horse hair finally breaks.

1) novel virus. Much like beta release product, virus effective side effects (some long term) know of.

2) still segments population they've performed many tests (for example indegenous Americans African Americans), could also lead serious side effects.

3) already mutations happening (again, novel virus surprise) could account vaccine worse (or better, idea necessary sample data work with).

I’m saying gloat right now, also understand people are. 

And AIDS largely education issue point. yes, know prevented, people don’t never taught. Let’s take far appropriate analogy.

A family member dies AIDS. communicable disease far effective easy follow prevention measures Covid.

How appropriate feel would gloat infection death. problem virus infects people slowly, 1 year infected 1% speed reach 80% take years aren’t responsible distributing patients shot, determining group vaccinate. That’s state function. Indeed, preys young women insult young women would never able position power first place Even 100% effective, like said protect vulnerable mRNA types (as healthy young person) gladly take less effective Oxford vaccine frees supply need more. Maybe 12-18 months time production Oxford/AZ vaccinated peopycan get mRNA boosters? Isn’t like half country technically obese?? true Fuyuki, EU countries agreed would get all. Therefore, countries like Netherlands wait supplies distributed Poland etc too, therefore receive substantial amounts rest EU orders fulfilled. 

It almost certainly increase deaths, that's price EU unity. invalidate they're doing. They've vaccinated number people UK despite 1/7 population. Even per capita vaccinating significantly faster rate Trying feel pity. quote says right multiple country numbers iffy, go poke China it. definition example blatant bias.

The sending fact finding mission find origins virus, investigate China handling number counts. Australia wants investigation China, virus.

Vaccine single-shot without cold requirements could bring control pandemic quickly after. see approved Jan/Feb major news.

Astra inconsistent reporting bit concerning less optimistic. hope learned large backlash US trial much better conducted.

I work extremely high risk population. We've unbroken lockdown since March. average age residents 78. They're desperate. staff. can't get answers.

Why exactly? I’ve worked Walgreens 15 years don’t regular vaccines. pharmacists/techs don’t want possible. that’s maybe 10-15 flu shots day, usually peak, flu season. don’t work anymore don’t know projected daily goals anything, cannot fill ~300 scripts plus regular vaccines plus covid vaccines monitor patient 15 minutes without significant increase budget. Knowing company like guarantee get nearly enough hours cover this. might get hour two per week covered overtime overworked pharmacists. mostly opinion, based years working knowing like cut corners. Yup. Every sports stadium filled, mass inoculating people. may “fair”, it’s quickest way toward stopping spread. I'm sure could talk HR. risking peoples' lives even aware sick protect themselves. irresponsible. understand bills surely work would willing accommodate prevent spreading deadly disease. hospital lets happen ceo hospital terminated spot.

It's exaggeration say UK version treated like veterans US NHS employee. 

The advantage people anything NHS tells Don’t worry everyone corporate saviors CVS, Walgreens Safeway going vaccinate everyone save world. /s

Complete shit show rollout, called months back, leaving rollout hands private profit industry going absolute disaster. 

This seems like opportunity army shine coherent unified plan take charge plan logistics, setup vaccination centers around states, deliver doses administer them. Also create National vaccination database. 

Cmon America we’re already fucking up.  mutations substantial enough considered different strain change shape predicted proteins? India big country. everything developed country has. Compared population small, plenty cold storage plenty people pay mRNA vaccines think nothing cost given option. majority come $20, still millions can. days ago respective EU officials stated ""unlikely"" AZN/Oxford vaccine would approved January yet receive necessary data. announced tougher restrictions ahead new year celebrations, country witnesses fresh spike Covid -19 infections.

I stopped don’t want argue family, man pissed.

I hope lightens time realizes she’s real dumb. already developed immune response, infection. distribution fantastic. military federal departments done great (albeit *perfect*) job.

It's 'healthcare heroes' fucking right now. quite frankly, point, awful lot deaths next month hands.

This unacceptable. UK strain beginning spread. We're time. can't afford slow-walk further, ***people die.*** Take vaccines hospitals use national guard. Start getting shots arms **now.** Stupidity. value lives less day mickey mouse That's point really thought of. Imo ramping vaccine production much possible forgetting much costs Key part article says start seeing noticeable decline cases around 20% vaccinated, don’t wait 80%, that’s true herd immunity. cases start die noticeable way, countries around going slowly surely start easing lockdowns restrictions. Yes. think Israel purchased like 3.5 million something. going help already struggling healthcare system region. people putting religion safety others. sympathy whatever happens them. ""Westerners"" can't even admit african union good job covid. SA couple countries good, continent light years better europe americas.  Israel bought like 16 million pfizer doses. 2 doses per person. western countries bought around 0.5 doses per person. Israel gets doses. time Pfizer ""begging"" US EU buy doses allocate capacity... Speaking nuts, know yellow M&amp;M voiced JK Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson)? someone define ""effective"" here? mean catch all, consider protection (and/or?) severe disease standard. makes pretty easy. Sinovac release results probably next week. Vague...  ""dramatic decrease"" ... 

That almost sounds like much decrease hit 70-80% 
I really think that's trying say he's spreading much hope statement. Give us graduated decline metric... marshmallow... believe that's issue links found vaccines adverse side effects. far know, actual disease would bad. there's guarantee everyone get disease/pandemic, hence dilemma. ""pay more?""

""Nah, would cut profit"" Question everything, trust billionaire wants rip everything put backyard mine boggling don’t give FUCK wife kids. want push agenda wants lower worlds population says Ted talk. 

But let people inject u something tested going thru “great reset” isn’t virus came wet market plan top 1% planning years controlled fear. 
 us favour stay house like good citizen don’t spread cold around lol thanks bud I’m killing anyone. Profit motive manifested healthcare system evil force universe.

You need look understaffed overworked hospitals, lack supply proper PPE, price care end bankrupting many lucky enough even survive, pharmaceutical pricing see such. evidence right front eyes anyone open point. 

If governments give private pharmacies anything needs come threats stiff penalty inevitable fraud greed commodity like covid vaccine is. know states fine exactly? Money machine goes “rweeeeeeeeeer” According sources Indonesia agreements purchase 430 million doses different chinese vaccines (seems they're really trusting chinese science!). many doses amounts way need total population. Warp speed ass Different like able see friends move freely? Seriously good ""new normal""? I've seeing lot. specific origin telling people get covid ""it is""? need two shots, that's 660,000,000 get us 100%. 70% herd immunity, 462 million. First week 500,000 vaccinations. 462 million divided .5 million 924 weeks, 17 years so. That's picture end week one. course expect get better that, week one numbers. actually conservative though? 

Seems like personable guy likes attention/money concerned comes from. would make grifter. Thanks response! you’re describing might relatively common viral infections, though I’m certainly expert. also remember seeing graph posted user Fitbit subreddit showing resting heart rate changed COVID, IIRC similar you’re describing.

My resting 55 bpm, extended periods time 110-130 range, spikes even higher that, kind mentally fucked up. potential COVID symptom cough. Isn’t DoD pays company make adenovirus vaccine? Specifically boot camp? specifically says 9am eastern time done yet. knows current federal government. joke. Googled peanut butter shot apparently it’s bicilin (an antibiotic similar penicillin). would US military give high doses antibiotic everyone, regardless whether bacterial infection? Seems like would contribute antibiotic resistance (and give ton people side effects reason). they're old enough understand brought endangered lives well, I'll ask them. 95% number low dosage protocol second shot month first. single dosage protocol numbers ballpark 66% right line 70% figure here.  Mate, Astrazeneca tried combine two different groups took different amounts vaccine get 70%. still got approved.

Sinopharm released efficacy today certainly release details early January. great analogy bad. 

Insufficient vaccine immune response vaccine worse vaccine due antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). risk ADE Covid19 approved vaccines still unknown presumably considered low risk *with manufacture's recommended vaccine schedule"". would assume risk ADE higher full vaccine schedule followed. Yes yes, government can't anything right, heard first time mr regan Nah. deaths tragic.

Predictable? result total disregard oneself others? Definitely. 62% first shot hard time believing 37. I’m British, fool. Genuinely curious: Would possible virus burn population antibodies vaccine _or_ getting virus itself? Dr. Fauci’s number include infected? wonder whether there's agenda play, times.

I'm sure mostly sky-is-falling Chicken Little's, I'd stunned state actors China pushing doom gloom West. Don’t test student athletes make sure they’re using steroids? title post literal quote article... dad died year liver failure alcoholic. basically nothing *could* do. want China held responsible over. vaccine tested differently participants swab tests home every week work efficacy levels. vaccines that, asked people monitor symptoms asked people test. actually efficacy data vaccine likely accurate data fully released. However issue incorrect dose given first, people group seem higher levels immunity. Though need data half dose see truly effective, I'd that's actually fantastic news means vaccinate people. Legit thought fireworks  hell lot controlled saying positive test immunity! That's I'm saying. Don’t sweat it. many vaccines effective reducing prevalence disease population. People seem freaking fact vaccine may eliminate transmission completely (it likely reduce, don’t know much). specialist particularly surprised this. It’s big deal. 

The takeaway need remain cautious folks getting vaccinated year. Continue distance mask. Yes, gradually able lessen restrictions glorious light end dark tunnel. getting vaccine recovering Covid isn’t free license go nuts significant portion population also immunized and/or numbers brought down. remember late December early January gathering friends talked happening China serious shit. though fucking crazy. managed convince one friend shit go down. 

Haven't seen since day, wonder remember told them! They're pretty much changing things phase 1 supposed firmly establish mid-phase 2/3. Definitely normal confidence inspiring. Instead we'll use backdoor throw money big business kill people disagree politically. Probably asked said vaccine X% effective, exactly % mean? GF still college university 100% online kids already paid ""senior houses"" year still live campus. told house across street months ago party kids spilling onto lawn, estimated probably 200 people attendance. 1% 200 people 2 people. told kids ""if party, 2 kids going jump roof die"" would likely party. essentially doing. know stats way lower people age actually worse consider people contact within next week. Sadly, think rich people allow happen, even though totally possible. they're vaccinating people exposing COVID test effectiveness? 30% people still contracting COVID? three quarters country Tier 4 restrictions, let’s hope figure go following weeks. Senate approve anything Biden charge, they’d rather see millions dead lift finger help anyone need. 2047? like never times infinity. control, wish. actual lockdown supermarkets drugstores open, still number new cases barely going down. hopefully happen next week, lockdown started 8 days ago. thought back March we'd quarantine 6-8 weeks tops we'd back normal talking weird month half. completely wrong. Internet though. Internet big forgiveness matter much someone asks it. happy continue bash someone mistakes long person admits wrong. done much testing typical vaccine? could imagine companies wanting years testing they're liable everything time assess. pretty sure need vaccines public school, remember graduated permanent record list vaccines dates received hate you. really, unless marginal players. Pro athletes often injuries require year recovery. 

For college athletes, though, much eligibility, may even graduate recovering. Depending school, may worry scholarships out, well. Pretty sure virologists debunked claim like March. 

Gtfo garbage conspiracy theories IIRC it’s 2.1 million *reported* vaccinations right now. lag time states reporting number doses given far longer reporting infections. instance, officially 70,000 Californians vaccinated, data current Dec 21. reality there’s probably ton given shot since then. Also, Virginia reported nearly 20,000 vaccinations Dec 23rd, sure got number from.  Well second statement absolutely false, Ohio State prime counter example know. that's point.

Frankly think there's plenty safety data. problem can't explain, effectively, right dosing is.

In opinion, let's say worst case efficacy reality.... vaccine still play important role. see EU FDA letting ""well sure best dosing scheme"" fly.

All say, think UK citizens risk, get answer. here. Said ""real"" numbers far less (librul) media reporting. told numbers spike flu season. told reading virus well informed. seen since October, wonder he's dealing blind loyalty Trump. Oh agree plenty people would willingly standby make 5 hours would think. Oxford's UK arm swab people weekly. stopped Brazil/US arm, presume good reasons. think Sinovac might also regular swabs, reported high portion asymptomatic infections data (2 3 vaccine infections), one else did, use symptomatic infections end-point.

One mRNA vaccines trying assess asymptomatic infections looking antigen markers vaccine-infected volunteers, clever methodology, think results yet. 

When scientists say ""we know vaccine stop transmission"", mean ""the odds will, every vaccine do, evidence generated yet one.""

If want assess transmission stage, swab families close contacts volunteers, data inevitably useless many people fail comply time.

Even evidence turns out, expectations, vaccine prevent spread, still expect dramatically reduce it. know vaccine good reducing symptom severity, good evidence reducing symptoms also reduce transmission. See research agree. anyone study suggesting legitimate risk catching virus outdoors I’d love see it, studies I’m aware suggest risk low enough letting outdoor activities go ahead focusing money resources preventing indoor spread. problem people assume lots people=bad without considering environment. Right are! asking. Fingers crossed quick rollout all! There's interesting research vaccine efficiency tied well slept days getting shot. Matthew Walker talks book one interviews, recall which. work get vaccines distributed quickly possible.

I expect capability ramp significantly next months figure new supply distribution problems, mention changeover US leadership. point compared one mRNA vaccines 95% efficacy preventing infection (and thus related instances ""long Covid""), AZ vaccine looks like shitty deal... Gilligan's fault higher bar that. expect competence.  vaccine? Great. Completely useless though unless they're administered.  They've plenty time get thing running current pace take years that's acceptable.  need go 1 million LEAST Germany currently fucking worse country, lockdown 10th probably extended, currently 60k people vaccinated shortages vaccines everywhere several states receiving next shipment 8th  translates 11 million infected / month (if fatality rate 1%) 22 million infected / month (if fatality 0.5%).

It’s almost there’s hoax going around killing $20 per dose extortionately expensive American used insane drug prices could say otherwise, especially compared Oxford/AZ vaccine $3 dose.

It *not* expensive compared costs associated covid, clearly laid you. inconsequential budget. time nickel dime. explain USA made Oxford/AZ vaccine larger order American vaccine Trump's called 'Operation Warp Speed'

Sure does. goal U.S. enough vaccine cover entire population July. U.S. refused (initially) expand Pfizer order. Pfizer agreed delivery second 100 million doses *by end July*, ordered.

As already said, mRNA vaccines new technology production slower compared AstraZeneca much conventional vaccine. that, U.S. able place larger order could still delivered time.

Twin Peaks. Bob Judy dont exist right? Right?? argument UK blowing us water fact they're same. right. family members wouldn’t survive 3 days virus, aren’t anywhere near top list. Science response UK amazing probably world leading - shame scientists charge however. yes there’s evidence it’s massively different 1%

yes is, based cases deaths August only. There's little doubt mind we'll vaccinating general public late spring early summer.

We'll vaccinating general public February, late spring substantial amount people vaccinated. especially true vaccines get approved, especially one-dose JJ vaccine. Last read, one ready approval around mid-January. Ya, seems like ""doing something"" measure real solution. Workplaces source transmission transportation. rains, pours. Manufacturers don’t enough data say vaccines definitely prevent transmission (although early data moderna shows could lessen it), they’re making definitive statement either way yet. knowledge, neither Fauci said definitively transmission lessened, though, need information. know anyone believef s*** first place. They're going winners majoirty world population. Unfortunately US Pharma developed means high prices US priority. cold supply chains deal breaker many countries. Hopefully coming decades issues fixed. fellow U.K. citizens would LOVE jump train hound said, I’d like agree. 

Our government deal extremely high population density, wealth young people love break rules. I’ve questioned lot recent decisions, they’re getting awful lot stick deserve. calculated COVID-19 fatality largely based first wave August 17, 2020 cutoff selected one-month release RECOVERY trial results assumption changes COVID-19 clinical practice would alter IFR compared earlier pandemic 

Since first wave [CFR covid-19 dropped meaning **lot** cases added lead deaths. citing study based cases spring?

If CFR 1/4 then, reasonable assume IFR calculated least half calculation, likely even less.

It feels like people advocate harsh measures need IFR high justify that. way around course, let's use available data least? far know thing.

There's simple fact vaccinated people still going able get virus, test positive maybe even spread virus manufacturers said multiple times now.

Like many times explain 95% efficiency means people still get beyond they're telling sterilizing immunity degree can't get virus.

Nobody said test positive virus get vaccine!

That's everybody making s*** heads want imagine viral immunity mean complete 100% immunity that's never point viral immunity ever meant.

Viral immunity means increased resistance degree virus longer threat. still mean get mild symptoms infectious goes away rapidly. also mean full sterilizing immunity, manufacturers I've already warned expect full sterilizing immunity.

It appears least certain percentage vaccinated people still able get virus probably test positive well develop symptoms maybe even spread virus.

This one reasons they're saying vaccination rate average confident sterilizing immunity know tens millions people going drag ass getting vaccine leaving big reservoir easily infected assholes flood hospitals. Welp.......nice knowing everyone. You’re mixing stereotypes. People play cricket don’t say bruv innit.

Everyone drinks tea obviously It’s long. Also clear blood tests taken. 
Seems close enough Dont want bells palsy. Thanks. entire subreddit fear porn

Accurate.

Still though, decent source information, look headlines articles posted. others repeat exact thread Swedish numbers occurs every day.

But alas, u/StratifiedBuffalo started fill Bingo card already. Everyone pre-manufacturing. spread doubt whatsoever, nothing article says anything connection. write ""eldery person dies"". like regular strain, dad thing. So, need mask up. brings peace mind, first time medications administered way, temperature mechanism. known vaccine could given way. One reasons Moderna got contract true experts this.

mRNA (messenger rna) fragile heat destroy it. combat Moderna patented way encapsulating mRNA lipids (oils/fats/non polar/opposite water) protect them. That’s moderna last refrigerator week opening.

Moderna using technology cure cancer patients. made specialized medications based cancer, primed body mRNA hunt destroy cells. research, also developed 10 different vaccines never applied FDA approval. mostly going used outbreaks developing countries, one certain, SHIT WORKS.

Pfizer didn’t advantage Moderna‘s mRNA’s heat shielding protecting mechanism. However, long it’s kept cold, work.

Now here’s bad part. vaccines fundamentally different traditional ones. They’re complicated high percentage make sick allergic reaction. people may even die watched properly. least system make vaccine weeks needed to. mechanism action, good better traditional vaccines. antivax people field days that, warned early. body’s response means it’s actually it’s job. feeeling ing 5 years “booster” shot based 10 vaccines worked best.  


I wrote don’t want feel sketch administer it’s cold things. remember, we’ve exact administration cancer patient. it’s safe enough someone already dying, rest us okay. okay....ish. believe Himachal would open June/July international tourists big way think places getting people vaccinated work- especially healthcare workers. community, we’ve reached stage vaccinating “independent practitioners” it’s seriously word mouth level.

What’s goal? states “calendar” sorts government page. Colorado, medical staff get vaccine Winter, risk people Spring, general public Summer. headache get likely due lack oxygen, I'm surprised.

What's ""order magnitude""? typically phrase means factor 10. China ""literally several orders magnitude lower"" believe China has...what? 0.1% many COVID infections? 0.01%? 0.001%?

Who's delusional one again...? first trial meet US's standard vaccine safety.

This bit disingenuous makes sound like vaccine safe. much data FDA wanted. might right, though think there's good chance might leave one up. use keywords worst slurs use, like ""Republican"" ""doomer"" K-name.

No. People said lot start, understanding would outbreak earlier March case. symptoms somewhat different too, likely medical examinations least cases would picked coronavirus pneumonia regular flu.

Yes, that’s problem. happened fast. Months lot time prepare vaccinate 330mm people. Alaska currently one 11 states stated plans prisoner vaccination, spite high rates incarcerated people. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article hoax, hyped, 'hey, deserve get vaccine first', good look way around. I’m also happy trust decision, long information based decision also available parties better qualified study critique want to. Hopefully that’s already true.  Jesus Christ, never said going end civilisation. It’s gonna make day day life shit next couple months. fired, allowed walk terms. You’re thinking backwards. Conservatives easy trick leaves open infiltrated grifters. Great response, everyone favor providing information. people aware better, thank you. shall see happens data it, fingers crossed!  Seems like MHRA approved based solely November data, patently ridiculous given fragmented was. 70% pooled figure keep citing particularly egregious given includes results dosage U.K. isn’t approving use - real number low 60s. Obviously, easily achieve herd immunity 70% effective vaccine I’m you. 60% efficacy isn’t far typical flu shot. I’ve flu shot 22 years life I’ve still flu majority years, sometimes twice. really bothers thinking many flu hospitalizations deaths may indirectly caused life.

I would absolutely take take flu shot. would feel uncomfortable resuming normal life. Everywhere go would worried infecting others like long Covid. would anything go debilitating fatigue experienced 2 months mono again, something many Covid survivors described. actually far socially isolated sometimes tired even hold conversation bed. make appointment second shot get first shot. use website track everything county used covid test results (if performed county). also scan vaccine card system reference lot number manufacturer needed later. verify identity drivers license AFAIK. Many neighbors 65 plus vaccinated week pleased easy was. we'll probably exceed pace solid month if/when J&amp;J gets approved new mutation double Moderna fine. mean is, Wuhan controlled cases shutting completely, asymptomatic minimal symptom unable spread virus self heal. EMA said data sent AZ insufficient approval even filled application lmao carry know talking about, shut mouth come like even bigger fool.

Considering I'm total moron understand very,v very, simple math, still timeframe unrealistic, set unrealistic expectations.

Except...get this...New York City, NEW YORK CITY ALONE, vaccinated people combined polio entire country currently Coronavirus NEARLY FULL FUCKING CENTURY vaccination rates nations even slower.

Yeah, literally country many vaccines already **delivered**.

The U.K. already developed far comprehensive concrete guidelines hitting vaccine rate targets. surprised literally exceeded us total vaccinations early next year Oxford vaccine fully rolls out. whiskey make sure Similar Professor could use coconut launch satellite outer space couldn’t ever seem create simple raft get island, COVID-19 result us relying highly complicated technical solutions take years research develop (vaccines) instead simple things could ended pandemic much sooner (creating billions rapid home tests telling everyone test every morning stay home positive conjunction wearing masks encouraging work home).

I’m basically saying Health Leadership bunch Professors island charge Mary Anne lower tech wisdom probably would done better job crisis.

RIP Wall Street starts handing free drinks casinos done Here's better version: Shocking. awful news  He's joking. ""130% population"" thing. Yeah doesn’t sound like intention continue things long term. I’d lot concerned said least another month.  Thank you, appreciate responses. Getting close 1% population. current 230k/day 1.6m/week, gain another percentage point every two weeks. needs least triple mind. also true highest risk people getting first, should, theoretically, get us closer herd immunity faster distributed randomly. explain it. seemed reasonable me. 

It way double checking suspended particles U-V, didn’t show up. (As remember it, might little different). 

Do genuinely think wouldn’t put something place avoid again? Gosh. think that’s little cynical. 

They spotted right away changed check months ago. Quick calculation means pace vaccinate entire population 1415 days so.......

I'm sure get quicker slow start. Relaying luck. luck runs dozens dead bodies new outbreaks several cities. suppose people got used now. :/ bridge Detroit Windsor still operating, lower level, people still daily commute Windsor Detroit Again, get long COVID taken AZD vaccine extremely mild case it. I'm really struggling see issue here. vaccines prevent hospitalisations similar rate - efficacy (apparently) 70% 22 days, 60%, get long COVID initial infection reduced mild cold symptoms, organs taken hammering. Seems odd picky. Nutcases. Sinister nutcases folks. Moderna needs regular freezer. sadly find video elsewhere. professor Luke O'Neill, find better source. cares hope right. Hopefully correction would begin next week New Years Friday. rate isn’t going remain same. tried. really really did. provider took me. reached like 53 providers. got ghosted 3 times rest dismissed request. gave search hurting lot, made worse.

No, mean mandatory? gonna fire don't? Seems pretty counterproductive really really hope AZ J&amp;J US trials read soon. Also, regulators need willing look foreign trial data we're crisis, although probably late learn lesson pandemic. 

No, UK trial show safety data e.g. Native Americans, could still safety studies groups here, *allowing* people make decision whether want wait safety data come receiving shot, since many instances medical treatments noticeable safety differences across races, although exist. fact one-day spikes still getting headlines like . . . Masks never panacea, anyone viewing enables bad behavior thinking everything right. actually could driven complete mask usage though, respiratory disease happens spread breathing, level filtering is/was better none minimize spread. point, we're already ravaged COVID masks better damage control that's states filled people would rather cough breathe people deal slight discomfort. Virus kill 2021 2020. Seems like you. google zero base knowledge Anti-vaxxers cool headlines me. voted Biden still suck getting vaccines out, I'll pissed.

I honestly know slow distribution Trump's fault not. understand logistics getting shots people's arms. whoever charge things needs fucking get it. I'd suggest read scientific studies work. run experiment controlling everything except one thing testing. means testing vaccine everything else remains constant (intervals, dosage, etc.). want test another interval, different study can't combine data make claims around hypothesis. also can't claim large trial 30k people make claim around efficacy study arm enrolled 2500 people.

Edit add, pretty key:

"" 18–55-year-old cohorts originally planned single-dose efficacy cohorts. However, protocol modified July 20, 2020, offer second dose participants cohorts result robust booster responses identified evaluation early immunogenicity cohorts (version 9.0; [appendix pp began Aug 3, 2020, resulting longer gap prime booster vaccines cohorts aged 55–69 years aged 70 years older, participants enrolled two-dose groups start. ""

So group longer period first second dose 18-55 year olds. can't assume efficacy would hold apply larger population, unless actually test it. Jesus said, “fuck you, got mine.” Well yes, also lot countries severely fucked suppressed facts harassed whistleblowers China, that's kinda part point, I'm good enough articulate mean fully. tried get fancy problem. infrastructure procedures developed social prioritization system. Hospital workers easy..you tell every hospital go sign many need vaccinate staff they'll distribute themselves. know that. mandate vaccines employees already staff actually distribute facilities storing it.

But beyond infrastructure determining falls group, validating teacher police officer, whatever categories place.

That's good plan, maybe trump administration interested governing hard work, could PUT infrastructure place last 9 months instead twiddling thumbs 3 weeks vaccine looked like would ready, perhaps could pulled off. 

But didnt' that, said ""here's loose guidelines, states now"". every state differently causing confusion distrust.

So instead simply send pharmacies like vaccine. pharmacies get paid distribute it, ultimately end done age group.  Keep 65+ excess inventory. go 60+. 55+. 

Is ideal? No. perfect world get vulnerable people first move groups SPREAD most. that's difficulty thing do, obviously government good solving difficult problems. keep simple least understandable fair way. previous information suggests level transmission occur Meanwhile malls open ppl lining like savages orange weird hair? Well, fuck Hospitals extra personnel anything administer hundreds thousands doses month, each.

Because they've laying people last 9 case notice, hospitals slammed patients moment already run (for capitalist reasons) without much extra headroom first place.

Everything I've read suggests ICUs full, areas hospital less full normal elective procedures either suspended reduced.

So maybe nurses laid starting back April May, could picked back deliver vaccines.

I know. thought. shit doesnt help. kidding risk dying covid 100-500 lmaoooo literally dumbest shit I’ve ever heard. official mortality rate .12% someone underlying health issues. Fastest ever. rate, vaccinate 80% American population 5,040 days little 13 years

(280million/500,000) * 9 days massively overblown.

The short term effects ignored, like sore arms, fever, achiness, etc.

I eat old underwear long lasting effects vaccine worse average symptomatic case Covid, also appear 6 months post vaccination. health agency doubted effectiveness

The problem mask work lulls peopel false sense security. Hence peopel expose themself more. becomes net positive negative cant tell. Vaccines currently use side effects, almost apparent within first days weeks shot given. Even reactions rare. So, standpoint vaccination general, low chance long term side effects manifesting months years later. true, feds political leadership still ones authorize $ going back us would quicker middle managing beuracrats need time able discreetly ship truck fulls vaccines sold ton ruling caste like politicians famous actors. well it’s common knowledge regardless die test positive within 28 days death gets put covid death Let's hope.

In case, vaccine nitpicking grounds really odd, particularly since waiting mRNA vaccine there's limited supply, herd immunity going reached slower, really going increase chances long COVID.

Well, definitely tested people first. could get bunch people volunteer, give vaccine not, see safe. study months. could call something like 'trial'.

Oh wait. Hrm. Almost everyone know believed could potentially asymptomatic unable get rapid antigen covid test. Potentially continuing spread (not always choice, forced work without result, etc) 3-5 days. Don’t act like variant hasn’t cause Cali’s issues weeks now. “Just found” ass remember saying — caseload control US, lately, it’s almost January. statement think would see sharp decline cases, say, mid January? question, anybody, haven’t able get answered. vaccine doesn’t stop transmission, herd immunity work? said around 70% population would need vaccine potential herd immunity. vaccine doesn’t stop transmission, won’t need vaccinate virtually everybody herd immunity? Remindme! 6 Months ... how? Currently getting downvoted mentioning issues like mental health child abuse fallout lockdowns. I’ve saying weeks. like March headlines would hear one two cases state people arguing wasn’t here. I’m serious flashbacks. aren’t going it. fight worth having.  Sad say humanity true. deserve planet hindrance universe. Right? It’d easier contaminate food/water/air rather vaccine people don’t even want take. Speaking fellow Ontarian, response second wave anything abysmal. Even though know get this, feels never-ending Ontario. We've locked month Toronto much show it. provincial municipal government seemingly decided take abstinence-only approach without acknowledging take away *official* avenues social gathering people going anyways. even months rising cases despite months business restrictions, guess Chief Medical Officer Toronto's response is? restrictions businesses coming next week.

I know *that* much longer this, 2021 I've dreaming (travelling Europe July August) seems reach. Maybe sounds selfish traveling thing keeps sane, care going concerts, bars, etc. click governments sake society, economy, *everyone's* sanity *need* normal lives back? downplay risks covid, detrimental impacts restrictions factor decision-making? Would great fast forward 3 months right seems like everything government mostly show give appearance ""doing something"" ""taking seriously"" everything phrased binary yes herd immunity think start vaccinating 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50 percent, going see diminution [of cases].

The reality going big push open things governments going hard time holding reigns back. like people 70 go hospital case counts go super crazy, might still putting unnecessary strain healthcare system.

The majority decision makers well aware able get going prior full herd immunity, really worth talking pulling back restrictions still early stages vaccination. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine got approved UK today US wait till April approval? going homeless encampments. opinion Israel's greatest accomplish, murdering United States sailors USS Liberty genocide Palestinians? Canada's population density lot lower US. 1/10th US population greater land area US.

Governors control federal government. joint control. I'm vaccination program - totally agree get entire world 60% efficacy way faster alternatives, amazing. 

But UK announcements seem praising equal vaccines, without highlighting major differences efficacy vs. speed/ease trade offs. surprised US least pushes testing well total numbers Phase 3 lot smaller approved vaccines. That's nothing. Even **$3000** would've great deal, since lets end lockdown faster. America wants give much money pandemic support every citizen anyway, might well spend vaccines.

Obviously nothing replace going hangin people don’t really choice right toughen pheasant. reports getting 6 7 doses per vial instead 5? Yes.

Additionally, flip employer scenario? people gotten passed over, they'd talking.

There'd way keep wraps hype focus going on.

It's one thing hospital pass dose put turn. another thing double easy disprove lie. Depends like do. need varied culture urban life, disappointed. College towns good respite, even small rural areas. least wear mask? Probably party, right? synonym ""preventable fraction among unexposed"" ""relative risk reduction.""

Recruit population that's large enough expect 100 cases Covid-19 period time. vaccinate population, expect prevent 70 cases time.

This analysis correct getting sick Poisson process - something like lightning strike. That's generally true diseases. Getting sick alters probability getting sick because:

 - people die get sick second time
 - people survive usually become immune
 - even not, they're likely inherent resistance died

If disease rare changing question change numbers significantly, Covid questions want answered like

 - prevent people getting sick first time?

 - much would improve chances never getting sick Covid?

Still, there's good reason epidemiologists use RRR here. question *they* want answered is

 - many people infected person expected infect?

AKA, reproduction number. *If* preventing symptoms making people infectious RRR 70%, means 70% reduction reproduction number.

And want get reproduction number solidly 1 cause cases per day fall.

Still there's bit problem well. Preventing symptoms always preventing reproduction, though usually good sign. 

Prevent sneezing coughing prevents lot droplets. prevent fever helping immune system recognize pathogen, probably mean pathogen can't get established.

So tbh find particular statistic exciting. answers *a* question, ones want answered. never said vaccine released, continuing put words mouth. People lined McDonald's everyday problem brush aside. still think adenovirus vectors wisest ideas.  I'm glad developed case, really careful giving technology access nucleus cell unless purposefully trying implement kind gene therapy. I've got PhD, still guess responses nucleus takes foreign material enters. Would love mRNA vaccine myself. Agree. mention 1 5 people may work Amazon shit continues.

No one takes anything else seriously though, want read news death toll everyday. wanted pass along.

My siblings, partner Pfizer trial us unblinded. last receive shot today. I’m one workplace never got virus paranoid obsessively careful since beginning. think mask always wear paid big way.

I can’t believe great felt get actual vaccine (no side effects yet). don’t know like 28 days fully kicks in, weight shoulders insane.

The mental aspect I’m looking forward to. know things suck big time 28 days states, least acknowledge going concerned everyone else without worry loved ones. 

I shutting leaving house 7 days second shot. Hopefully don’t get COVID then. would seem way, forgot part America, senior administrators working home 9 months get vaccinated people actually working hospital. Athletes rich gotten vaccine US. doctors, elderly, high level government officials 

Stop making shit Someone household tested positive! January 22: Biden suggests mask mandates! Liberate Michigan! Liberate California! Liberate America! virus! wants take guns! Removing logistical barriers making sure right people get would probably help speed process significantly. Let CVS walgreens start letting people reserve spots get vaccine allow help. Even making anyone 65 sign spot, automatically gets spot would due second dose. need utilize resources already help distribution rather creating new system. love people fascists leaving country considered crime lol. Anyone who's mad guy asshole needs fuck imo. I'm literally embarrassed live planet bunch people thread uh didn’t know that. J&amp;j hardly delayed right? opening paragraph article literally says ""Delivering billions [vaccine doses] one greatest logistical challenges ever undertaken"".

To coordinate vaccine, materials, patients [90% population, spread across 3,500 urban areas, rural areas], workers carry endeavor easy feat. 

Additionally article says nj ""allotted"" 512k doses. Allotted delivered typically mean thing, article specify. Substantially pretty subjective. I'm 25-35 group Based research, difference .2 .02 age range (CDC website)? That's nothing afraid IMO. ideal world- I'd take risk SECOND life could go back normal. I'm asshole realize population like death knocking thier door, even tho symptoms I'm following advice experts staying home. can't go forever... took vaccine couple weeks ago, second dose first week January. take antibody test. Reddit: “Fuck big pharma, fuck Pfizer profit hungry corporation, they’re bad”

Also Reddit: “anything goes wrong Trumps fault, there’s nothing wrong vaccine, don’t get don’t trust *Science*, doesn’t need 1-2 year testing, it’s like would roll vaccine minimal testing would make billions dollars government contracts” Actually mostly Republican leadership blame. back claim good chunk experience long COVID symptoms data? Generally curious this. sure deaths backlogs reported Christmas week. They've suspiciously low even Tuesday, usually see sharp rise due weekend lags. soon enough, 900 probably 1,200 deaths become new normal sharp rising cases going new variant know little of. think maybe assertion must underlying conditions.

If asked 'Did underlying conditions?' doubt anyone would downvoted you. really, no. HMOs currently leading effort. happens .50 caliber? Wow - that’s pretty big blow. favouritism US companies going here? know trial mess really harm people? millions UK elsewhere getting it. Unfortunately can’t talk serial con artists cults subreddit hurt troll feelings. really think vaccine going enough lot people sub want go back normal start socializing again. They've locked homes barely left almost year likely still paranoia fear people. They'll come another excuse theres still chance get Seems like ""perfect enemy good"" situation. People hesitate get shot case someone deserving might need it. slows overall pace. need loosen rules give shots out. Hundreds millions doses manufactured shortage month two.

In fact, virus solely climate destruction irresponsible destruction nature, pandemics viruses diseases kinds, including ancient viruses bacteria currently locked away sea ice frozen hundreds millions years rapidly thawing, going bunch prevalent near future. Friend similar dream, dead body dropped sky worst enemy's roof living room. also joked mother's dead body launched cannon. might issues. 1 500 absolutely bottom end. even close. even nearly close. achievement creating vaccine absolutely worth celebrating.

All I'm saying way way way way prepared actual vaccinations are. able ramp really fucking quickly. Meanwhile 10 days NYC 12k per day? I'm seriously asking, makes think that's acceptable? could day 1 number. reason ramping taking long. it'd interesting know? conveniently leave antimask agenda immediately prior death.

This story leaves many campaign posts, insisting masks needed, many posted within weeks death.  Children need school. It’s fundamental development. close safety that’s one things, act like it’s big deal economic decision minimizing damage sacrifice children experiencing. virus enormous lose, lose children even haven’t high risk serious health complications. don‘t think there‘s much use masks distancing endemic.

Wait wot Oh man, 1 year anniversaries who've passed away coming up. tried general search saliva tests sub saw articles first got approved. issue starting weeks ago, Dec 19, roommate became sick. tested doctor's office office traditional swab. Positive. weekend preceding test, fiance (also roommate), fiance (also lives us), played cards together around table also lived normally house. quarantine wear masks Tuesday felt symptoms decided get tested. rest us got saliva tested Embry, major tester AZ. negative. tested fiance got positive. tested got negative - process original roommate continued test positive, lost one test, never posted one negative tests portal plus spammed 4 times one night test results also sending email notification weeks late.

I developed symptoms (coughing, dizziness, body aches, chills/sweats, splitting headache) think trust negatives. fiance says evidence need, roommate positive symptoms, I'd like know. anyone else experience saliva test? concerned false negatives processing errors? really bad spit test, adverse reaction botox migraines weak throat muscles dont generate ton saliva. took awhile fill tube took fiance one try. Thanks- can't find much info saliva Yale, seems either made testing procedures developed test. Well disregard science, ultimately get.  that? Distribution inefficiency people refusing take it?

This is. smaller Church involved one is, people want feel good validation people fake are.

It's sad many people realize beginning relationship groups. Yeah initial point wasn’t detract bystander CPR, early intervention reliable way saving without it, you’re likely wasting time.

And would agree high quality CPR without mechanical assistance, CPR wears even people decent shape. speak area, good 75% coworkers overweight obese, older shape. describes least 50% local hospital staff. someone maintain high-quality CPR can’t climb flight stairs without sweating getting short breath? swapping every 2 minutes works enough people rotate through. (And honestly I’ve seen people couldn’t even make two minutes without lapse compression quality). That’s good comparison. discussed doc. says distribution plan flawed inherently thinks federal, state county governments need ramp vaccination centers via health department scale up. Trusting CVS et.al. feds leaving states figure hap-hazardous testing since March. feds need fund organize distribution, working states set vaccination centers counties need staff federal funding. Else fact two vaccines manufacturer required per person means pharmacy exec buy two vaccines per person hold one back second shot, hoping person comes back, use dose another person hope order three weeks. Either way it’s business problem. Centralizing via health department, worked previous vaccination campaigns, maintain scaling need federal funds guidance make happen. bit testy we? kindergarten explanation you, five people got around reading post confused. 

LPT: take things personal. part every year worse worse finally /r/collapse due Indescribable climate chaos.


Almost nobody realizes truly fuct are. literally dropped emissions zero tomorrow likely still would completely f*****, bad sure. shot literally takes minutes. vaccine building you, walk by.

From article sounds like hospitals deliberately giving entire staff case side effects. guess sits freezer week something. sure can't give doses patients people meantime. option? Like work unsafe conditions afford feed family.  anyone expect short lines? 

embarassing national plan dumped states getting from? That’s data published. missed lot royalties... Relative population lot, Israel's population 8.8M, vaccinate approximately 150k per day today.
There also almost resistance it, even speeds vaccs more. Well obviously general public neither us (I presume) regulators. easy answer informed guess suppose, actually tell us to?

Are testing half dose may change approval later, bothering simply going permanently new single full dose approach second 12 weeks time? 

I'm glad happy regulators full details pick choose tell everybody else (like new 70% figure) I'd prefer total transparency round think moment.  plants could provide us source every nutritional need. Oh wait, can. wrong. LA county #20 according per capita. large county San Bernardino neighbors LA county. small counties could show spike one moderate size outbreak. know look LA area think something different going there. inaccurate. mortality rate younger people lower, half hospitalizations 65 years age. Younger people respond better treatment, get hospitalized, even rate lower, older people vaccinated, absolutely see demographics hospitals tilt towards younger. question whether young people continue disregard health measures, willingly work put hospital. Detroit Lions... 

We sinking feeling though.   guy, isn’t. None wet market exist.  Reportedly flu vaccine widespread Europe administered doctor rather available local pharmacies.

During flu season US 1-2 million shots given per day. certainly possible roll Covid vaccine widely.

But lot people reluctant take one reason another. went dentist morning hygienist (in 60's) said going wait months ""been healthy"". make sense everything people makes sense. Romans 13:1 “Let everyone subject governing authorities, authority except God established. authorities exist established God.” This!

Yeah guy's ridiculous. Even world vaccine, general population would eventually reach point they're fed caution say ""Fuck it, mask going trash I'm hugging friend first time 1 year.""

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* sorry many people feel way. Feels like lost humanity back dark ages. People bloodthirst. Yes, Florida California hit hard virus. Almost like shouldn’t fucking pointing fingers, instead need fucking doing. Like goddamn amusement parks open. Hey, prove wrong...
Last checked IDF work snooping around Reddit. 
You know, Palestinian blood Passover .... know US still doesnt much vaccines require ultra cold freezers? supply chain gets better days pass? thank GOD republicans said hoax refuse wear mask getting shots. Whew. holy shit me?! wonder connected random fluke. also sent ER bunch tests trying figure resting heart rate kept spiking 150. really sick previously beginning year couldn’t get tested didn’t meet testing requirements. bet kept Fear t-shirts 90s. like said. approved based study 9 thousand people led 62% efficacy.

And lot organizations spreading misinformation higher percentages. lot even reporting insane 95% spreading misinformation purpose. media gladly following along.

Imagine happening chinese laboratory chinese media. People would start using words like dystopian. Tricking public vaccine's efficacy. actually read fucking thing? Kind of. UK going use existing supplies vaccinate many people possible give second doses available. problem second doses supplied while. NBA really depth physical health exams players drafted. don’t remember condition was, really good player one Texas schools (Baylor?)who tried go pro found rare health condition made risky playing basketball. 

I know MLB requiring heart health exams kind players returning covid too. Ridiculously late. Remember, every time delay regulatory reasons, people die. 

Wanting take one month, maybe two, observe things go Britain get trial data, could understand. 

More four months excessive.  understand saying. elaborate? need point out? Universal studios theme park consists mostly claustrophobic closed spaces doubtful ventilation. People breathing other's necks. Lots queuing lines. specialized knowledge area, almost seems like exercising waiting pulse return normal baseline might safer course action.

Exercising stressed heart sounds potentially dangerous, like could increase damage. idea sports medicine doctors saying this? Sure, complicated allocation plan, slower process be. Keeping simple, age, would eliminate lot resources (time money) spent figuring tiered group. Yes. comes back beginning saying federal government could mobilize national guard help pandemic vaccinations choose. May Rest Peace amazing small company work put together comprehensive contingency plans myriad things might might happen.. Hurricanes, fires, etc.. 

Yet state far resources writing wall months can't make simple fucking plan. Florida? That's great way it. worry part issue shows, guess always invite 5% slots try squeeze everyone show up. Plus, apparently collectively decided old people expendable. think *living* going option telephone interview next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged slowly deliberately moving goal posts. so, said, partly based new science, partly gut feeling country finally ready hear really polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci said. “Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 85.”

Sure sounds like lying me. Also, lied masks early pandemic, isn’t even epidemiologist. He’s trustworthy rando much that. Let begin process rendering idea false! :) so, happened? sure flu colds? Especially getting flu twice part, year, vaccine? ICUs full? one assholes hospital bed means poor healthcare worker, grocery bagger, unlucky grandma caught virus getting one. horrible?

If people ""personal freedom"" flip side personal responsibility. brought upon people suffer foolishness. I’m air traffic controller can’t get it. hospital gift shop worker get it. Wtf sad sucks! loved ! Hope I'm wrong, I've getting feeling CEO's might start closing hospitals using nursing strikes/etc. scapegoat. so? *per capita?

Its easy talk none family/friends affected covid way. hope advises people take care next dark episode. year, didnt really matter damn it? history book.

Shit’s annoying even since I’m trial won’t unblinded March, unless end vaccine recipients group beforehand. GOP Congressman take office January dies heart attack related ""procedure"" hospitalized COVID-19. So, family doubtless dispute death caused COVID-19. r/Columbus fuck “Good News?” TBH actually seems like epidemiologists want end reputation = better spreading lies, must CCP dictionary. spoiler alert: cant Logic would say plausible infectious, virus act faster. 

How arrive conclusion? Logic dictates opposite me: less deadly version virus able infect people thus spread faster easier, whereas deadly virus kill people and/or kill quicker, giving less chance propagate. 

The virus may also completely become non-dangerous drop fatality rate 99.9%. 

Now course, made up... like person ""may"" statement above. Except earlier ""may"" comment negative mine positive, statements disregarded entirely since there's evidence behind either. 

I'm doubling calling statement fear mongering, since completely unsubstantiated discussion virus becoming deadly. Counterpoint. I've terrified needles getting anesthetics cheek hurt like hell 8. Long story short, hugged doberman lol, turns adopted dogs well hugs children. 


Before would watch drew blood, since then, anxiety minute know shot coming even though know hurt Actually passed American History High School. book doesnt mean retain it. Plus WW1 typically glossed favor WW2 day.

Question stands though. dont monument 1917. 3 vaccines approved west, possibly 2 (J&amp;J, CureVac) coming along. seems completely reasonable, although still wish easy place learn more. guess go digging around PubMed, BioRxiv, NCBI etc see comes -- area moving quickly may new papers available.  data unclear way trials conducted poor. last data package sent EU 21st December deemed insufficient approval. don’t know what’s going Correct. example getting shipped two orders 10 million doses each, 5 million doses. receive two batches 10 million doses, insist keeping half first batch reserve second dose, vaccinate 5 million people first batch, instead giving 10 million people first dose using second batch finish vaccinations. think part much involved vaccine care required. got lightly jab ten times, exactly something that's conducive production line vaccinations got basic. wanna put 40 kids weird scabs arm together close quarters? Half flight got pink eye, imagine would like smallpox. are. small outbreak Sydney dealt via contract tracing, targeted lockdowns restrictions. yesterday 3 new cases another state, linked initial outbreak.

Our coronavirus sub losing mind atm though. I’ve dated enough nurses know DUMB. 

I’d love see breakdown vaccine acceptance profession. Sounds like volunteering assuming lot people careers. Username checks large outdoor activities ok? so, many Christmas/New Year's parades cancelled? sporting events held outdoors also cancelled. allowing large outdoor activities continue. think Boris Johnson making decision? hoping one 90% plus well  agreed, point vaccine can't get everyone quickly? Bless Colts. Same. Holy shit this! exactly it. Restrictions anything except pushing people hang privately. Honestly whether gyms open doesn’t matter lol. testing well. would wait go back see case numbers react. would massive approved. Single-shot, strict cold requirements, cheaper. Would make realistic bring pandemic back control normalize situation US Spring. That's true. really think politics coming play - mean, Chinese government officials literally promoting [this far back - nobody wants take blame virus, obviously. way trust US studies right efficacy masks (and say American), I'm bit hesitant take studies damage control China face value. Nothing country - say accepted virus start market jumping gun. traced nearly 2/3's original cases know back there, 1/3 could easily come contact people after. Logic would dictate *probably* started there, US army official pinning on.  Well must problem! didnt Great Grammie tell stories! Yes. Maybe convince people make safer choices, hospital staff won’t burned out. don’t know it’s left, it’s lied. Week old article. hope really ready worthy approval especially considering cut number people trial covid widespread thought need extra 15,000 participants I'd said rollout vaccine exemplary. I've seen reports logistical problems countries experiencing looks like got early enough ensure we'd enough doses. Yep, I'm hill northeast valley foothills. absolutely infuriating. 😖   perfect could start looking prescriptions. CVS Specialty handles biologics chemotherapy drugs verify people active prescriptions. 

For broader public pharmacy regularly use also see inhaler prescription, insulin prescription, high blood pressure medication, etc. would agree two vaccine leaders (Israel Bahrain) exactly global powers enormous spending budgets. Canada facing logistical incompetence mismanagement. instance, despite moderna vaccine arriving Pearson airport week ago, Ontario government still given access it. believe single dose moderna vaccine even administered yet anywhere Canada. understand large portion moderna vaccine shipped north territories portion allocated provinces incredibly slow roll out? 

I truly hope initial hiccups federal provincial governments best right now. Hopefully 8.5 million timeline general Hillier gave accurate truly truly truly hope level government steps up. Young people still spread people higher risk. don’t die doesn’t mean won’t cause someone else die. told you? Try asking RIP Canada? far know they're still keeping goals projection based two vaccines approved far. 

The goals bad though anyway, vaccination rollout overall hoping approvals move goals up. great day Biden sworn particularly like guy. Trump embarrassment best. Trumps behavior disaster country. mean I'm supposed look way Governor stupid shit also? Universal like Disney. Everyone reservation stand line first come first serve. would karma people taking joy someone else catching this? curious. would released early January I’m cautiously optimistic incoming administration working diligently overhauled vaccination plan, ready begin implementing almost immediately come inauguration. Amazing news Operation Ludicrous Speed forget 60% businesses closed likely forever sounds like opening mini CVS Walgreens clinics within assisted care facilities. clear offhand facilities already staff needed give vaccines, need nurse. see can't train people give vaccine nurse staff case reactions something. It’s like USA 6 touchdowns fourth quarter. score touchdown act like game. worry this. much. permafrost thawing. It’s there. Waiting. vaccine obviously seen .... it’s though rollout easy thing do. 40 like flu. 

The mortality rate age group COVID may similar overall mortality rate flu, compare mortality rates age group virus COVID substantially lethal ages 15 Tomorrow vaccinating employees residents assisted living facility. getting old people. hearing young people they're probably hcw. gonna hear/see social media old folks homes vacinated, happening Well US 11M doses “available” 2M given, breakdown somewhere production administration shot. It’s wayyyyy late that. Community transmission control since April control. 

Also vaccines rushed all. went clinical testing vaccines. Vaccine development usually takes years lack funding lack trial participants, that’s clearly issue remember January friend said something lines ""luckily diseases always appear Far East governments little regard personal freedoms simply lockdown complete city keep disease spreading"" saw video Chinese police persecuting someone trying avoid lockdown. Little know. daryl strawberry video mask on? holy ppl stupid standing shoulder shoulder masks on. Younger people still want live cities social aspects. Suburban migrations settled down/established types increase. Still Europe bud... eu.  Agreed, edit clear. trying make single number averaging humanity.. referring particular young woman passed, confusing. Well put. Yes, issue protecting lack second dose face good reason believe lack second doses. kinds bottle necks reporting. probably safe assume 100 dying per day right now. like year prepare anything. mind boggling.

But yeah sometimes doomer instinct strong. think post like equivalent waking kid school don’t wanna get up. vaccines fine buddy, yes points make sense it’s gonna terminator land eating homemade cranberry sauce 1) think people appreciably changed since dark ages. fact horrifying conditions us prisons persisted long shows people take gratification punishing perceive wrongdoers. Sure peoples' knowledge living conditions changed, emotion (ie biological) reactions? I'm sure.

2) person power actively fighting kill countrymen, point dying public good. dying thing assuring everyone leftist conspiracy really dangerous... Well irony strong. Consequences already happening areas. know right people. Ask frontline worker friends. may hookup.  comparison placebo recipients symptom % vaccine recipients symptom %.

A trial assumes people go live normal life. Data collected including symptoms. symptoms COVID reported, person tested COVID tested positive would symptomatic person trial (on either placebo end vaccine end) - least Oxford trial went AFAIK.

So take numbers compare % net difference vaccine made placebo reducing symptomatic infection. January 2020? shifting timelines already apparent Covid-19 vaccine distribution U.S. — even rollout starts coming days. Trump administration May 300 million vaccine doses would available January 2021, first distributed October year. October, shifted 100 million doses end year, [according Health Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Currently, plan 40 million doses [distributed though health care [are even prediction.

300 million 40 million?

Who hell charge program can't tell difference 40 million vaccine rollout program 300 million vaccine rollout program?

This America without hope. American people even expect success competence anymore. expect accept everything broken always be, willing accept success.

Proper project management would running vaccine development approval concurrently distribution logistics. clearly happened.

The vaccine approved, planning on-the-ground last-mile distribution commenced. Going 300 million estimate 40 million estimate estimating... guessing, wishing, hoping. 

What would differently? 

*concurrent distribution planning.* Concurrent vaccine development manufacturing. 

Anything short failure. 2.1 mile human centipede. Anybody order cuttlefish? bad - I'm idiot. !Thanks clearing me. look worldometers.info, see even countries Nigeria Laos better. next years expect dramatic loss influence U.S. - rightly so, creating culture value citizens' life. saying 30% got Covid vaccination got symptoms? one line, thought this.

Even Italy countries hard hit simply go back normal social behavior despite consequences. Lockdowns work complete total maintained weeks. Natural immunity high know many friends got went away like regular fever. argue gravity day long, step outside 10 story window...

-Dow Jones Yes! must still wear mask!

Note efficacy reported trials precautions (masking, social distancing, etc) still place. also know transmit infection get vaccine. Precautions need continue followed while. Best 3 million year :( podcast Bart Chrysler Stupidity needs hurt. 
By mean painful someone something stupid ""ow"" way...

IT PAINFUL MONEY LOSS/FREEDOM LOSS WAY. athletic all. run quite bit I'm cheap free exercise.

Well makes fairly athletic compared average american anyway. got first dose vaccine happier. work pharmacy looking like going left behind community weren't. already made appt next dose. Yes. course. ""what fuck wrong you"" guy made exact point. Things likely get better. say ""this scorecard week 1"". regardless much better things get, continue scorecard week 1.  Yeah. According article Bloomberg we're currently worst country.

Edit: meanwhile one cares enough report governor republican occasionally says trump bad Well said! Grab trying promote itself. teehee wonder would good idea temporarily shift vaccination strategy U.S. prevent U.K. strain taking over. Lock vaccinate communities surrounding strain discovered. spreads everywhere correct 50-70% transmissible, add months getting back normal. 

I think treated level alarm restrictions first covid cases. think incompetence lack planning. scarce resource let go they're safe. many votes concentration camps amazes even 1 year, people still can't get story straight Dr Li. 

1 year later still passing around info whistle blower arrested killed CCP. motivation think lie for? would FDA accomplice them?

Do think made numbers up? too. think always didn’t see guess got worse. wants join cowardly weasels militia  lack self-awareness post downright remarkable. Careful treading awfully close karmatic waters I'm still understanding. 

*What* happening (or happening) 70% vaccinated people within 3 weeks vaccination? clear anywhere me. Meh. severely immunocomprimised 20 year old much greater risk healthy 50 year old. 20 percent? People dying sitting vaccines. Wtf would like see two comparisons number republican vs democratic politicians infected, also died covid. Would interesting see laid side-by-side direct comparison. complicated cuz much paperwork. submit two forms week ago, sign another yesterday, probably one tomorrow get jabbed. nightmare boss. first thought! Lol agree 100%. saddens people downvoting voice reason.

Look, I'm public health psychology expert. personal experience. trying persuade someone something, whether quit smoking, designated driver, wear mask - really blatantly obvious things, right? - I've found much effective empathetic holier-than-thou I-told-you-so attitude, often makes listener start getting defensive likely stubborn resist change. whole ""us vs them"" dynamic especially toxic lately, dividing us, helping. ""We're better we're following guidelines! We're better we're wearing masks!"" OK, great, thank you, maybe less smug it? especially true public health ""them"", one community.

So man, I've never heard clearly importance community. Died 41. record mixed bag, find tweets supporting social distancing, find pictures without mask. he's human. could biggest denier world, there's tactful way approach telling people may cared ""he brought himself"" it. right way, call ""politically correct"" whatever, ""this tragedy family, one die like that, unfortunately reality happening hundreds thousands people around world, good come this, hopefully people take seriously.""  changed original title thats it. government wants eat bowl keep economy going.

Of course, pick wrong M&amp;M, *your* problem, government employers'. time increase availability organs. Simply people indicate driver's license state ID would willing organ donors death would vastly increase supply.  don’t understand don’t deploy mobile units systematic way go neighborhood neighborhood vaccinate people. Wouldn’t easier take vaccines masses rather ask masses come clinics hospitals drugstores? 3-million per day seems overwhelming. ain't chief country? According you* Wow. That's awful. hate say probably last virus pandemic we're going see next 20+ years. Hopefully template use next time.

Medium long term symptoms cause disruption fatalities. please, tell 1% fatality rate Even still spread - scary think things like someday get pandemic 2 3 times death rate mean tbh thought. seems like China always scary bird flu something crops makes kill insane amount animals contain it. December/January really thought would turn same.

I wish had. really. sort make assumptions though guess. NYC, less 300 people age 34 died total (vs like 20,000 total deaths). includes ""probables"". compare, 12,500 people age 75 died (incl.

It's annoying intellectually lazy, hugely successful. requires absolutely shame interest truth. wish science always won. definitely lost Ebola early HIV outbreaks. Fortunately able learn situations improved science time around. I'd love understand this. would take AZ vaccine 70%, especially since approved dosage got 62% efficacy, Moderna Pfizer 90%+?

They safe. I'm angry. saying dumb shit. You’re right. CYA bureaucracy fear PR backlash partially really infuriates me. They’re going keep shipping new doses hospitals plan says first 21M goes healthcare workers even though can’t get ones people’s arms. God forbid run risk news story saying nurse couldn’t get vaccine dose wasn’t distributed young non essential fellow managed jump line get vaccinated pharmacy. It’s apparently better let people die risk that. Pfizer stays viable storage 12 hours, believe heard similar Moderna. means that's issue. Yeah, it’s old people die. happens time flu, bruh. /s read article yesterday vaccine rollout. One person got mentioned get appointment reminder come back 2nd shot. said like things busy he's expecting someone follow instructions. mess. Anthrax fun vaccinate against. Hurt understatement. Nope, saying working ass low salary part life stay.

Corps made lot money pandemic, things continue way WFH insure people work even hours even LESS pay. Thinking year going lead anything resembling 'good' pipe dream. id - doesn’t? Yes say logic, reasoned based history, like product ever. rules apply.

You cant set distribution chouns product delivered. ramping production.

It ILLOGICAL people sitting waiting give shots shots give.  do, locations people go.

To assume peak distribution like said, idiotic listened Adam's podcast months around 2013 2014. OK really overtly political time, complaining mayor Los Angeles every often. kind got bored podcast basically thing every day. feels like eternity ago.  literally changed title buddy.  Covid 19 Sars variant. vaccine candidates made using already done attempts Sars mers Read “tests positive COVID, 19 months after” like 

damn it’s long How’s stupid? cancer I’d also worried coming back. Would wish leukaemia instead covid? I'm honestly kind confused 70%. Moderna Pfizer's vaccines 95%, mean good protection Astrazeneca vaccine? I'm aware 70% 3 weeks first shot, increase 3 weeks second one? Anxiety taking hold telling I'm fucked get Moderna one Pfizer one... Trying convince that's true. point vaccinating everyone can. tiers totally asinine slowing everything down. know help high risk individuals? Reducing community spread fast hospitals overwhelmed. picked interval phase 3s trying combine phase data. It’s called p-hacking it’s frowned upon scientific world. set experiment try test one thing, run different experiment didn’t work, try add data different protocols signal appears.

I’m certain vaccine provides form protection, can’t say certainty protection didn’t run trial enough people show that. Notice they’ve switched “immunogenicity” wording: They’re assuming antibodies relate protection, *probably* safe, FDA even methods apply using antibodies rather full trials, disingenuous pretend Oxford data level Moderna Pfizer data. top tier always top tier, progression everyone else, driving wages workers companies seek cheapest comparable labor across country job longer location-dependent, phase, move countries lower labor cost. 

The story American business last century quest cheapest labor. developing countries catch first world terms education, see white collar jobs eroded like blue collar jobs 70s 80s. “Became?” Dr. Drew always hounding people admit they’d molested, even hadn’t. Adding list library. miss one? Y’all need read “severance” ling ma! Good pandemic book. already loss use phrase 'better vaccines', vaccines advantages disadvantages certain scenarios welcome approved need all. Firstly worth noting 100% effective reducing hospitalizations. Secondly thing makes vaccine incredibly useful simplicity roll complex cold chain required. Contries like Germany Spain struggling store/distribute mRNA vaccines counties like UK cannot vaccinate vulnerable care homes. Oxford AZ vaccine relevant key exit strategy. Mink medical privacy rights? fun times main reason one would take precautions, even guaranteed, virus left quite children without one parents, vice versa. quite.

It's saying relative vaccine 70% less likely symptomatic COVID 19. Whether still getting COVID 19 rate without vaccine asymptomatic get largely unknown. probably somewhere two. evidence COVID yet Amen that, he’s hero. hasn’t really changed views anything, left moved left him. course, larger population exists prison **a)** they're executed outright, **b)** imprisoned trial due process **c)** despite highly unpleasant rehabilitation-focused, US prisons still far less *deadly* prisons around world. 

How's work China, again? Especially Uyghurs? lot things cause sudden fever besides COVID-19 Lymphocytic Leukemia. That's largely unknown although widely expected least reduction transmission.

The best we've got terms data subsection Oxford phase 3 results, confidence intervals wide: (see table 2). would say largely unknown terms data.

Note leading candidates Oxford one. Well yeah difficult complicated lots factors play main thing reduction symptoms, reduction hospitalizations, reduction death. get worry reduces spread contraction future vaccines pipeline. Maximizing benefits minimizing harm primary goal. CDC models epidemiological studies evidence table go considerably depth model cited Technology Review posted, would appear CDC strategy would result fewer deaths simply prioritizing age group alone. I'll argue contrary, lack research could indicative lack severe cases, turn might ease panic. 

It's like link Vitamin severe Covid, subject numerous studies discussions. Good bot Sure thing, too! Glad could teach something moving average around 70-80 deaths per day. agree long term effects. That’s partly argument coming from. notion young people don’t get sick covid flat incorrect. cares less likely older demographic get hospitalized, rate hospitalization still way high compared baseline demographic. Comparing old people doesn’t favors. Half hospitalized patients 65 even skews higher get closer age, plenty people 20’s, 30’s 40’s hospitals right now. county alone almost half patients....roughly 40%. Ascension Saint Thomas say they’ve seen side effects first dose Pfizer Moderna vaccines.



It would nice news agencies could use words like **FEW** title mentioning side effects. ""Doctor"" Ok want compare US - stop.
Israel 8.6million people..totally possible.
The states also issuing timelines, procedures giving out. Also please note people got vaccine, none participants showed severe symptoms required hospitalization 

From New York Times one received vaccine clinical trials developed severe Covid-19 even though 70 percent efficacy, participants go hospital developed severe Covid symptoms hospitalized.

Which win gives body fighting chance alleviates healthcare system, reason go lockdowns, least US. Wonder North Koreans, Syrians, Uighur people feel that... Blame VA - states setup involved. VA also I'm worried slowness. Lets take time get right perhaps time age group due get one done version thats also tested longer. high school college, common binge drink point blacked out. activity likely much dangerous people age statistically covid(I knew several casualties drinking driving, plus psychotic breaks occurred raver drugs) yet still it. 

I can’t believe ppl really expected teens early 20s take seriously real threat lol Absolutely pathetic.  needs nation wide, ""war time"" effort. create mass production lines create complex machinery, yet issues conjuring affective means shoot people vaccine? Exactly. I’m sick guys willing takes. 

If actually reverse climate change, doesn’t mean you’ll without car. 

We need willing actually make changes. don’t, you’re others. really, never think it’s toward Chinese Asians (they can’t really tell assume lol) AZ ran phase 3 trials much differently. testing regularly rather waiting symptoms develop. one guy Pennywise rampaging studio flinging poop everyone.  still invited back that.

There many good episodes guest. David Allen Grier best. hosted show Adam left. funny DAG TV, completely kills every time radio. Yes, that's i've heard too. new strain driving R0 vaccine tries push down, i'm curious balance works now. Someone said need higher vaccine efficiency now. would never consider athletic. best running performance got third last finish. really great. hospitals overflowing. We're panicking people listen. People dying something Covid greater risk death we're necks Covid patients. got I’m fairly sure got placebo haven’t side effects whatsoever.  UK always Europe. dude. Shit January bought flight China June since cheap figured. It'll done then. Little know. mean $50 round trip nyc Beijing called vasovagal response people, nervous system responding poked. new variant called B.1.1.7 501Y.V1 (V2 South Africa) scientific literature, ""UK coronavirus strain"" press. AFAIK current PCR tests detect new strain (that's found first place - UK sequences 10% positive COVID tests), there's reason believe vaccines work new strain. Symptoms I've heard basically - disease progression, risk death - 70% transmissible. got negative COVID tests far likely random respiratory illness (the flu still circulating, albeit reduced rates) COVID. Love battlefield No. I'm not. Florida actually this. count subsequent tests total number tests whichever day conducted, comes positive, count new person testing positive. 

Thinking it, Idk handle reinfections, though. may reinfected months later included either, that, really know. concept inflammation playing role psychiatric issues new concept.

Hopefully resources put researching it. Agree big problem drive throughs impossible everyone needs monitored 15 minutes vaccination allergic reactions yep. would mostly scratch though. SARS-1 vaccines failed far. experts agree we'll getting back normal mid 2021.

Are people honestly desperate point *any* word contrary triggering, regardless significance? I'm trying condescending here, get people getting fed up. However, find concerning people even willing tolerate discussion around possibility things may rosy one might like. He’s psychiatrist. doctor deals infectious diseases cancer daily basis. I’d trust doctors experts one deals mind this. dx shocking based Instagram posts. know 9 people vaccinated far real answer able pull wait spend 5 trillion dollars aggressive interventions. almost wildlife species severely impacted animals go extinct. war hundreds millions people made homeless mass casualties. poor face brunt misery. Yeah, issue nobody listens restrictions authorities refusing enforce it. I've 10 months everyone know. think comments going change random anti maskers opinions see many people either forgetting, unable make back clinic, deciding one shot enough, countless issues. 2nd shot also makes things like drive-by vaccination programs much harder.

I wish better data effective vaccines one dose. reports believe Oxford vaccine 70% effective one dose 90% 2nd. would fantastic news. 70% high enough make major difference distributing one shot much easier. Yes, brings implict bias normal weighted people obsese. says things point view, rare. mostly hear weight viewpoint skinny lost weight. think protecting feelings obese people, shudder think would concur program done voices poeple color women. big difference caring someone's health society's attitudes towards fat people. One scientific even compassionate bigoted. Much society tends towards latter people even attitudes. sad came away episode analysis. guess proves remind see things differently. guy stats!

This sounds pretty good. + fail become BM 
Have fun Idk maybe that's results US study expected Something always escapes... Hot take LOL love it! Priceless! won’t listen blame English infection rate rockets Agree, US reporting cases deaths accurate fair, literally porn vault. Literally. So, Taboo 2 time. Misread psychic got excited. realized plague kills grants superpowers others spreading across globe would still bad. boyfriend always hanging her. cute everyone virtue signal towards healthcare workers us essential workers make like 15% Health insurance safety nets almost equally dangerous situations, wait far longer vaccines, completely forgotten I'm west, also Chinese-Canadian started wearing mask since March. saw someone Twitter (a reputable person bot), showing pictures COVID rash looked much like zombie skin TV deal. No, really facts though. Sinovac Sinopharm already released statements serious conditions caused vaccines.

Sputnik already approved. Vaccination start Argentina next week.

Again, dumb shit. No, that’s reason. certainly “a” reason, it’s reason. We’ve learned lot covid, including longer lasting effects. Whenever see group government officials get together completely fuck something up, important realize elected officials group rich people tell do, unelected folks elected folks tell do. Also, many cases, leadership unelected group comprised hand-selected wealth-submissives, straight rich people installed there. 

If rich people wanted America respond correctly pandemic, government would have. simple that. didn’t realize cancer before, wasn’t context interview. changes personally view statement. Neither something anyone want get.

However, don’t know long term effects Covid yet won’t many years. long term, COVID may worse leukemia (depending specific type) high cure rate known, albeit arduous, treatments 17 year old son got vaccinated meningitis (totally unrelated Covid) similar symptoms rest day part next morning.

It annoying worth immunity. agree sure! I’m liberal, American guy (never voted Republican never plan to), lot friends family right. Would never think disowning something like that. realize it’s frustrating vegans know ins outs. They’re particularly empathic people see dishonest animal agriculture entire lives. claim love animals squeal cute farm animals turn around literally pay exploitation torture animals purchasing meat dairy, yeah - think lot vegans get confused fellow humans see hear horrific real things happening everyday refuse change make world kinder, compassionate place. 

It’s holier thou attitude, it’s desperation change *(points literally everything happening planet)* things aren’t going well haven’t noticed year. That’s one don’t listen to. Tommy mic hospital bed? page one halfway down. Point taken. Denominators pretty important stats, though 0.1% mildly interesting.

I'd like see: 

Deaths 40 / cases 40

Deaths 40 / population 40 Good Lord, 981 Deaths UK one day 4,758 US deaths one day, happening there? Hijacking promote HPV vaccine -- lots people know, authorized vaccine people middle age recent years. get avoid warts but, importantly, protect women world cervical cancer. Look more! want Gardasil 9. not. all. tens thousands cases day sampling 23 enough tell anything. guy Marfan Syndrome. Good caught it, Marfan's usually pretty obvious even looking someone. I'm actually really surprised Baylor catch own. Distancing work well indoor dining -- documented cases people far 20 feet away got infected someone Small request, make references Dr. Li Wenliang consistent? got confused separate uses Li Wenliang two different people. asthma 

Which risk factor. lived life without fear Covid-19, least 8 months, maybe 9. friend friend stationed South Korea last year, friend knew personally asked “Hey SARS thing gonna serious?” replied “...Yeah, start stocking masks” thought Australia great covid-wise? countries would happy trade places guys point. genuinely know doctors nurses medical assistants Healthcare workers walked away jobs. know have, I'm amazed every day people stay try save lives people adamantly refuse needs done reduce surge cases deaths.

We even begun scratch incredible amounts trauma Healthcare workers going soon. going affect American medical care medical worker availability decades, anti-maskers able get elective procedures check ups years I'd bet shiny nickel they'll yell minimum wage receptionist, rather contemplating helped create situation. Well yes media wants clicks, they’ll always make everything dramatic Meanwhile bosses allow co-workers walk around masks dick nosing mask long front customer, need get video case need try sue. work popular restaurant Virginia vaccine approval process frustrating. get want safe obviously much urgency.

The US already 2 vaccines approved plenty. tons data. one first start trials. data kind mixed though, think lot messy reporting.  Dr. Fauci ever said anything even remotely like that? Show quote.

Dr. Fauci good man busting ass help people, difficult circumstances. saw post estimated coronavirus infection health risk driving 7500 miles 20. 

It's high certainly nothing. Countries devote billions dollars road safety, consider risky activity. hundred road regulations prevent accidents. it’s combination “no normal 2022!” that’s making want rip hair out. Fuck China. already posted :) Let know single source baseless claims lmao. It’s well-known AZ data unclear American vaccines much better trials much satisfactory data You’re still letting parties tell “the issues” are, though. Social issues tactic rally voters without change money goes.

There ton “issues” don’t discuss politics, reason don’t discuss weren’t proven polls inflame half country half. Yep. We're missing forest trees. know help protect high risk individuals? Reducing community spread. idiots charge hire idiot friends  one caller know get pregnant blow job 

And kinda funny, people need someone explain things clearly time would EMA sense urgency no.... way words. I’d give award could. restrictions then. think intention vaccination stages high-risk people get vaccine first good, point clear working effectively. need setup drive vaccination stations across US need yesterday. Forget complicated stages, open everyone get done ASAP.  Emergency savings unemployment $ probably. Maybe they’ve without job months. could go 8 months lost jobs. essentially next 6-8 months regardless 2 million 300 million people vaccinated US. Come next summer, virus petering one way another. point, question whether due high vaccination rates, sustained high natural infection rates combination thereof. hunch combo scenario. Netherlands culled minks closed mink farms forever. (Farmers compensated that.)

Now already plan 2021, Covid moved forward.  We're witness history probably October since genetic testing nearly samples take long them.  Please, elaborate comment misinformation

If go comments, see moderator already removed comments deeper comment chain posted mine, moderator must already reviewed post, found nothing wrong with

So again, please elaborate misinformation? Something keep eye on. population mentioned article small, curious happening around world, usual superspreading random game. begins... mention far behind curiosity state in? Same, aside usual mild arm ache 48 hrs. say, immune system responses vary. likely. Right. slowing spread name game that’s vaccine. infectious strain spreading sooner could mean another lockdown didn’t happen. millions chocolate gelt coins shore Somali bank account. Wait, we're still surprised this? One sec, need go find ""omg I'm surprised"" mask. ones europe? bet every family europe wants much swedes.

sound wierd nation europe would prioritize family work special christmas.

i would never prioretize time vaccation work situation magnetude know everyone else company atleast tryed bare minimum  No, - saying anything already known nurse do, telling people take action safe. sense (and admit everyone does) they'll also realize get sick, way things hospital there's good chance get proper care enough staff resources.

There another nurse (maybe OR?) posted video following precautions. That's different story; someone like practicing. can't remember exactly happened, whether lost license suspended, gist is, practicing. Nah m8 tested negative yesterday entirely possible came directly UK. daily non-stop flights London Denver. people staying home work hospital? wife pharmacist hospital system got already. ""supposedly"", is.

Good friends infections serious.

How grandparents doing? Cases still growing Thanksgiving.  Yes You’d think 11k students you’d able find played high school football didn’t make team ""The Centers Disease Control Prevention said 11.4 million doses distributed 2.1 million administered latest figures released Monday.""

Soo.... yea yesterday Monday 2 weeks 2.1mil administered. 1/10th goal say ""project warp speed""? Yea old inefficient government wasting money. 1st dose need remind No, point party spent whole year downplaying covid calling hoax. Thats problem know it. may memory goldfish, rest world doesnt. long got part called sycophantic apologist, making bullshit excuses you’re told whoever you’re told to. me, wearing nose wearing them. opinion, know. 90-94% efficacy claimed anyway, really means nothing. fUcKiN dEd That’s actually really good point hadn’t even considered. Thanks! Sorry Ontario, scapegoating Feds ridiculous diversion going work. Get vaccine task force overpaid asses start administering fucking vaccines.   many hundred publicity shots middle-aged politicians look next two weeks?

I could understand old retired politicians celebrities, jumping line depraved.

Why first phase trials? hope (UK) fast-track US EU doesn't. trials US trials data due? True enough. hopefully experience (and science) targeted lockdowns. region, activity. Figure causes spread *and stop it*. Judging excellent grammar, tell parents kept family well need 100% effective vaccine; flu vaccine 50%-65% effective people still get ill people still die massively overwhelmed hospitals far less people worry dying dangerous complications.

The vaccines going make COVID vanish within first year they're supposed that. vaccines supposed remove need shut society completely worry huge swarths people dying getting sick, thus ending pandemic. banking society edging back normalcy soon vaccines start working, may well become hermit. low effort news story million ads Good.

Let small towns rot; go appreciated. Would work half assed vaccines. Every vaccine affects every person little different. Im Navy get seems every vaccine known man (way think are), Ive never reaction got HPV shot. passed tf one one reaction. Point shot blood draw really sit 15 min cause reaction it. Texas recorded highest case numbers yet: part virus patience!! 1 million per day would good.  11 mn vaccines shipped feds, 2 mn people's arms something proud of. Taking time never hinderance. Never. 

I mean, covid taking break. think people would volunteer want work two weeks order mass vaccinations? 

Israel making happen. Round clock vaccinations. Coordination. Dramatic measures. That's need here. There's sense urgency. Theres problem..... Facebook. Unfortunately many people wear mask, staying home much possible really best. following logic, ""third world people"" US created first world institutions, correct? Man getting confusing trying keep America bad circle jerk going US bought AstaZeneca vaccines(one source said 400M, another said 500M) citizens. 
They also deals numbers weren’t high AZ shots anyone surprised? I’m sure strain absolutely us. haven’t testing needed know. Covid needed one last hurrah get vaccinated haha 😅 pronounced ""taoiseach"". Yeah ok. I’m guessing PhD medical science told that? True, like every house America fire time.  
I don’t think rollout perfect means. least see starting improve So, suppose first outbreak Wuhan. Would better Milan New York? circulated around globe earlier thought. Wear mask, wash hands, keep personal space. constitute modicum caution.

I already gotten it(asymptomatic) promptly quarantined myself.

These common sense cautionary techniques warrant shamed want see world even suicides, overdoses wealth disparities already have. two weeks flatten curve!

Ireland locked two times need lock later. time last, promise! haven’t released actual studies yet. can't even begin imagine.

Keep fighting good fight, appreciated. Shave head put stocks build fence around tribal lands keep everyone locked inside till pandemic over. IIRC that's hopefully going one dose vaccine right? second dose worry even better Christ kid thing happened me. remember feeling like fire injected arm brushed over. 10 minutes later I'm standing mom signing stuff blackout. clue vaccine clue happened. Never happened after. still day though cautious sit car half hour driving home case. entire beliefs built around allowing rich people gift punish possible enslave minorities. vaccine free. mean whole picture people holiday day time major reason people break distancing  really hope somewhat normal summer 2021. really missed awesome one year, many plans. Hopefully Biden office vaccine distribution speeds we’re good shape USA good couple summer months. don’t want anything. need replicate survive. Fatality always correlated. Variola (small pox), Ebola, HIV fatal.

Some strains influenza fatal others, circulating century. Fatality time-dependent. done -probably CDC clinical labs- sampling ongoing population easy get go. issue made UK CO - person is, many infected allowed back country. No, let’s negative ten months figure give shots, technology wide use 130 years. Ah, another special election. great. agree really promoted LR testing much more. unfortunately think institutions started test-before-gathering schemes back community spread lower, gave false sense security. current spread levels false negatives inevitable. sorry. Please remember lot us take virus seriously. see us going grocery shopping every 2 weeks. posting Facebook restaurants going, family seeing. definition invisible things part want add misery Ptsd 😞 I've always found worry pain injection hurts nore relaxed hardly feel thing Underrated comment. Two million five million, unless think like Trump. Yeah know there's almost always exceptions simple explanation like that. Take entire book account everything I’ve got serious peanut allergy plan get it, epipen hand. Yes wishing death 7 billion people gets upvotes website  Yes, quoted end. miss u/enmeduranki intending sarcasm. think count rigged? Pziler jab person entrapped car accident side road; doctor greatest sight world. Yeah would mean 1 every 3-4 Americans vaccinated, 100 million people vaccinated. Definitely accurate.

Edit: fuck really stupid math, please ignore said guess good mine. think allowed either. *Precisely* anti vaxxers vaccinated atleast kids turned fine yet still somehow think vaccines harmful. Look status epilepticus come back tell positive 24 hrs able deal posted something like last week, said vaccinated 1 million people first week, got downvoted big time Promised 20 million delivered 2 million. Failure. Fired. totally get it, also stresses out. would suck getting first dose, nothing available 30 days out. asshole today tell need worry virus ask wear mask job. sick people bullshit. specific criteria declaration pandemic. hit threshold announcement far behind.  

It’s based many cases across many developed countries. 

I think delay whether China classified ‘developing’ country developed country. That’s economic indicator health indicator.  

It sure heck looks like developed country technically it’s GDP lower threshold developed countries. 

Seems stupid reasons can’t declare global pandemics without specific indicators. Yes missed it. Sorry. It’s healthcare workers contact positive patients. sad part we're actually bad compared Canada European countries. Im sick watching friends die. seen family 11 months. dont need cruel. new variants may transmissible children. Fewer ACE2 receptors necessary infection. Currently slow vaccination. rate back normal 2022. look state government instead blaming federal. Governor newsom idiot. would also illegal US. places 15 minute waiting period post-vaccination watch side effects? seems like large hurdle places like CVS/Walgreens. 

I work hospital vaccinated there, used big auditorium bunch spaced chairs side easy, 15 minute wait everyone makes lot harder set things like drive thru vaccinations. No. literally got injected vaccine.

She's also fermanagh, exist.  ‘government’ fucked up?

How kind name names. Agreed.

If CFR around 30% regardless age, like movie Contagion something deadly MERS higher R0 number, responses government people would very, different. Slow tf there, lol. literally came holiday week New Years coming soon. Sitting freezers lol heartbreaking. photo Christmastime dog sad see now. She’s 18 senior high school.

She’s perfect person monoclonal antibodies diagnosed. literally could worse. There's punishment strong enough Diaper Donald GOP enablers. I'd laugh wiped face earth immediately. I'd one millions so. Hospitals also continue test people admitted sites elective testing closed.  Someone social distancing wearing mask public less risky someone dinner friends family. 

Isn’t obvious?  mean it’s March 312th? pricey get tested without healthcare provider. Homeless people money that. Maybe that's why? shit going Wuhan last year, English... JFC SAD! hell pay taxes again!? lied squeezed more?? Fuck hurts watch GOD DAMN YEAR STOP IT!!! [Sitting correct. Production distribution bottleneck. Jabbing actual arms is. live New Mexico supposed two week quarantine come enforced. Well Christmas break tourist location, small town, thousands people Texas Oklahoma coming in. I'm worried see aftermath all. Sadly, doesn’t help. live GA, majority people selfish jerks can’t go without parties dining indoors. wish waiver every jerk could sign, assigning full financial responsibility (no government money, health insurance pay claims), automatic last priority treatment. never try prevent anything it’s going happen anyways. Nothing important everything already sucks. Got it. You’ve obviously made mind aren’t arguing good faith. remember thought kid walking along Vietnam memorial wall Washington DC. get end wall see people died right end war it’s painful know almost made alive. Stopping apocalypse bad? Imagine covid-19 1918, dont even ICU yet able create vaccine it. Majority people malnutrition, even America Europe. People would die sick much whatever left populations would actually develop herd immunity simply wide-spread. lucky got covid-19 2020 1980 would much much worse. Medical technologies advancements allow us keep death number low create vaccines months. Ok, ""natural"" herd immunity really thing! Incredible amounts death...so no. know term thrown about, please stop using it. 

[herd immunity going fair, muscle cells commandeered vaccine survive. Eventually cytotoxic cells show up, quietly take behind proverbial shed and, y'know....

Immunology metal.

F pay respects. Yes, knows many months possibly year get hands it? think things also start move faster staff vaccinated. know someone nurse admin role, vaccinated order start vaccinating people come January receives 2nd dose. Pom power Former medic, BH clinical last 15 years, I’ve nightmares year waking 2020 I’m 23 boss called. Please take care yourself. near collapse people make majority hospitalizations vaccinated. 

You can't keep saying scary things think makes true.

And tell gives life meaning. live U.S? covid pretty much everywhere U.S. Well depressing Tell ICU nurses? way base here. get 2nd shot January 7th!  don’t trust expert way give harebrained phase bullshit try get many people possible. US government every level incompetent get done otherwise Maybe nobody real life talking specifically want deal you. spamming types comments months, sure keep pretending new revelation. America failed state. We'll fuck too. really no.

The question whether getting one stage 2 stage vaccine good bad.

With antibiotics terrible take full regime causes resistant bacteria evolve. **Obviously bacteria virus** valid question ask concerns applies needs ruled worst bad case new super virus spawned, best bad case getting one dose worthless went waste. me. medic married nurse. never near fence. is, however governor 40 million people. doubt mistake swayed 40 Mil? Someone Reddit another described pretty much could described psychosis hallucinations suicidal thoughts. quite scary polio vaccine developed 1961 eliminate US 1979. Western hemisphere win 1991. actually, somehow, been. work system big city we've seen outbreaks shelters, anywhere town. really idea not. Yeah okay flu. I’m joining anti mask loonies pandemic pretty much still want wear mask 8 hours day work. first variant reported 3x infectious flu.

The newest variant 50% infectious 4.5x flu.

The flu kills 12-61k per year, causes 9-45 million infections 140-810k hospitalizations costs economy 10.4b.

A infectious endemic virus could disastrous every day life. don’t think there’s direct observation people variant infect x% people variants. believe evidence largely modeling inferences based rate spread London what’s known genetic mutations affect function. Lol, putting lot faith 112 samples December. could times sample size 100 rampant new strain could still slip cracks. handful isolated countries major travel hubs succeeded, everyone thought meant rest world could thing.

We focused containment measures buy time vaccine, rather complete eradication. Looked another light, people vaccinate, fewer serious complications weighing healthcare system. good reason, hopefully break kind healthcare workers. current pace seems like really month two go eligible, things done right, lot 65+ people.

If offered, discussed/recomended doctor distribution site. take it.

But would actively go way try get (if essential worker (have face face people daily/weekly work) suppose would try bit still actively heard more).

There people calling pharmacies hospitals every day trying get vaccine. Unless found vaccines location laying around (seems might case places), think plenty people qualify phase ahead know get unless actively told it.

But situation seems current mess states localities something different. least 12 million vaccines sites 2 million used. Everyone still wondering exactly going on. States ABSOLUTELY better distribution.
They’re already stretched thin broke pandemic barely able cope current surges virus. federal government unlimited resources call expert need country get job done. ones leading, throwing around vaccine saying “here, figure out” fuuuuuuuuuck. state cant get break..............well least doctors nurses getting vaccinated think anyone blaming public health folks (you guys rock!). blaming federal government failing give states money direction required ensure things went smoothly beginning. makes ton sense, right way things.

Ergo, country way. saying, lot people want world end virus. definitely harder drug store due people late delays. guarantee there's going lot spoilage released general public. hospital setting lot easier coordinate gets exactly many vials need per day. would know need reorder know many doses they've administered? 

If they've 5K delivered used 1K 3 weeks, receive 5K second dose, would sitting 9K doses... 4K need given immediately original \~30 day cold storage limit. potential waste product pretty high situation. instead received 2K (1K dose #2, 1K dose #1) 3 weeks, risking wasting several thousand doses.

I agree perfect world would used doses they've allotted 3 weeks, get next full shipment doses plus new people get first dose. knowing many doses place used would significantly reduce risk waste, case save lives. can, try move country hates people less... Good luck... Counter point: part targeted vaccine (spike ACE2 interaction protein) highly conserved, right? 

The measles vaccine effective years, reason outbreaks poor access healthcare much access poor healthcare information. R0 18. Yeah that’s going happen. general public going long wait get vaccinated. Possibly, many cases heals time. Depends severe case is, however. One coworkers, twenties, got covid, developed pneumonia lungs, oxygen last week. found exposed, I'm scared. ? Juan de Fuca. Last time went Europeans arrived. Estimated around 9 magnitude caused tsunami went way across Pacific. Really thoguh. still remember Dec 2019 like weeks ago Well people can’t expected put restrictions even another six months. that’s case it’s time move live lives. fear mongering articles allowed lot people got pretty sure got COVID didnt get test counted official figures? This! also autoimmune disease there’s many conflicting reports/stories/articles don’t know do. want vaccine, want safe least minimum feel safe(r). really truly little evidence says it’s safe option us. that, I’m going wait little bit see happens. fully believe vaccines medical science, I’m able stay home I’ll continue I’ve since March...masking go get tests done, curb-side pick up, eating out, staying home, seeing anyone...it’s incredibly lonely I’d rather safe sorry right now. hope information data comes clear it’s okay get it. miss old life haha. get yearly flu shot? ccp bot forum now. sub Reddit used filled least information use. It’s probably months. Spanish Flu lethal young adults? I'm sure would deadly, doubt, I'm sure would like Spanish Flu. surviving without job without income coming in? every country UK? Rarely.

In UK? saw 30% PCR tests last ""cycle."" (I think cycle month) China fantastically regard containing COVID

Got real proof that? NY Times deaths per 100k county level. Divide 1,000 get %. 

 [Coronavirus U.S.: Latest Map Case Count - New York Times 

I answers last 3 questions. Lucky you, feels like months. Can't wait vaccine widely available, mental health taking exponential hit.

For reverse, know there's end sight coming. 3 approved highly effective vaccines pushed I'm looking 2021 LOT optimism 2020. things start get better April? June? October? idea... despite knowing near far light end tunnel is... see now. coming! husband's cousin said same. Worse flu. hope feel better soon. makes mad distribution big clusterfuck we've months prepare plan it, yet are. Still though least vaccinations getting people albeit really slowly. call BS lot saying here. Sounds like emotional rant legitimate reason impose standard everyone everywhere. ""Our numbers death setting world records daily""...is definitely BS. Sad people's lives ending year instead inevitable later year, numbers miniscule. .oo4% population sad state emergency. incredibly high numbers recoveries real deaths. definitely raise alarms. place like Florida holidays....from Tampa Miami, gee pandemic dandy. states don’t report non-resident cases. backwards. report actual facts, get called ""doomer"" here. Thanksgiving right? Likely combination factors, situation get better. wife works medical field, first shot yesterday. currently bed wanting die body pain, fever, fatigue. Apparently get shot previously Covid experiencing much harsher side effects shot people never got it. Yup, UK sequencing 10% COVID tests. knew strain took concomitant surge cases, likely contagious. US flying blind. 

One wonder could explain Los Angeles areas getting totally crushed right now. Would even know?  Really interesting; thanks.

It seems like variants whole collection mutations. Cluster 5 share important amino acid deletion mutation New UK Variant, could make specific antibodies longer useful it. mink farmer one job! Honestly what’s point? They’re locked cases keep spiking. People done this, right wrong. Meanwhile states aren’t locked better.  genuinely never knew smallpox lethal bloody hell exact reason I'll never anti-vaxer. Yeah many people get it. Eventually virus run hosts Difference needle bigger saying trials perfect errors? sick last sentence sums half comments sub Reddit. RATIO AF. assume body's earlier fighting Covid. Viral load get high, reduce viral shedding. Reducing R value....

Which help reduce chances infecting others, stop it. I'm scientist, take said grain salt. Wait, huggable bear? full Gates transformation happens Well am. things start getting better, want type things way operate legally. Instead either die operate illegally. Things get little worse hopefully much better. fair UK media pretty bad, Reckless Endangerment. Like drunk driving. Excuse me. cases went zero. see (sarcasm)? Hasn’t enough time know vaccine effective strain? way vaccine requirements work many countries. legitimate medical reason (of few), okay. refuse magic fairy imagination told get vaccine, choose pose risk society around you, selfish twat.

I sincerely hope we're heading here. selfish twats globally made pandemic much worse would everyone took basic precautions. Oh darn No, mention it. 2020 taught anything, hope dangled front yanked away. $600 would help make payment Tulane. Thanks playing. Yes! regards comment, answer yes. Merchant Virus confirmed one actually infectious? Bird flu real scary one, especially farm animals, we're basically asking it.  mention children?

Because thread started ""France never big vaccination."" - simply untrue. cost vaccines even times 10 laughable peanuts budget European country. current prices, vaccinate entire continent roughly ecomonic cost week lockdowns. Okay, maybe enough vaccine everyone, part reason lack advance funding advance production. Again, saving money shouldt saved, costs money long run. countries even vaccine soon invest infrastructure still much slower process could - another thing Isreal got right. Florida known 2 months behind reporting deaths. think anyone takes Florida's # seriously. made reason feel good make money? trend missing? What’s different vaccine compared vaccines, besides mechanism it? one susceptible long term side effects? Every new vaccine denied denied early stage makes new vaccine dangerous long term? Death rate way off. often sequencing done? it’s based “feelings”. don’t sequence nearly many samples UK, still sequenced hundreds within last months haven’t found now, suggesting prevalence less 1% recent wave grew. increased transmissibility new variant around 50-70% would need significant percentage cases variant see noticeable impact growth cases. That’s math. 

And evidence seasonality make difference, even it’s enough stop virus spreading Southern US summer outbreak factors play related global worsening Covid? likely. mean variant driving outside places like London around two thirds cases composed it? Probably not. Smart. agree you, missed. Operation Warp Speed. /s lasts longer false, idea long term effects new vaccine could tested long term. else anyone going know? horrible side effects years line. speaking ass something important actually know, want. Stop. know, really bad end 2019 posted something “looking forward better year” post IG December........HA. HAHAHAHA.   Yes course. careful fill back Also know TON really religious people gone mission trips world documentation certain shots /vaccines receive proof allowed go trip enter country them. people acting like never heard thing like getting vaccine adult prevent community illness before. truly boggles mind. generates clicks I’m sure even playing bowl games aren’t even tied College Football Playoff. ""At current rate"" point. Nobody believes current rate optimal even going look moving forward. slow start going get better vaccines, clear distinctions next list clear expectations timeline. That’s true. weren’t trialed test whether provide sterilising immunity. sequence genotype virus patient patient mean they're wrong, here's hoping summer 2021 hold winding down, many people died it? 5 6 million? ridiculous amount course, considering human population easy us travel, could lot worse. think fair compare previous pandemics because, medicine, treatment general population unlike anything previous pandemics saw. Thanks covid! Still get it. seems like people ran stocked toilet paper ones refusing line get vaccinated. 

How offer free roll toilet paper get vaccine? Stay strong friends! I'm oldest child mom jokes dad's name suggestions bad even bother asking opinion siblings...they tell story true though Yes would. idea long Pfizer Moderna’s vaccine lasts speed paramount. Good luck US umm... realise fire thing metaphor, main thrust discussion ya? Don’t lie people. gotta truthful shit. don’t need another March situation everyone drooling masks don’t help like fucking morons. 

The vaccine going great experience. Way people experiencing arm soreness compared usual flu shot people compalining LOT soreness too. Reports second shot causes pretty rough flu like symptoms day two, much moreso usual flu shot would. 

These symptoms sign vaccine working. aren’t honest them, scare lot people off

I’m sorry, don’t need Vice President elect saying shot doesn’t hurt eroding public trust.

The shot isn’t painful abut legitimate side effects normal OK. cant.. so, like said, yes, Id rather stay indoors forever. Like, shit?

We started 2,000,000 shots like someone screaming EpiPen working person giving even get cap put perspective, recent one day new infection number find (dec 24th), entire country Canada (pop. ~38M) counted around 6900 new cases evolutionary reason mutation causing severe symptoms take pandemic (quite opposite, would typically although always spread less successfully). mutations transmittable course quickly dominate, variants ALSO chance severe would oddest bizarre bits bad luck. Almost unthinkable. means that, severe, seeing symptomatic cases variant previous dominant variant, correct? Swedish deaths per day 80+ 30. daily backlog. 

Translates 2500-3000 US deaths per day.

Edit: clearly seen website. Love get downvotes cause say something others want hear. see 3 months, virus probably us forever, like coronavirus' us since 50's.... I’ll still stay away parents  really, not.

the article says caught mink believe escaped farm. believe escaped form farm. news mink wild mink. 

And really hard believe country 300 million people first animal wild covid. Yeah, seems interest civil debate, I'm going end here. Good luck last sentence wrote first time really kept 💯 Live music safely return soon else, it’ll might seen big deal anymore. longer takes, worse it’ll be. I've seen opposite, least Texas far. Websites information, doctors offices saying wait contacted. got appointment calling like 40 places morning, I'm getting hopes actually get shot. Well, sent email yesterday saying theyve administered 7000 vaccinations far hospital dont know that's updated Bloomberg whoever tracking numbers (Doubtful)

I think difficult people comprehend big logistics game is. many hands involved since local leaders ones distribution. going take time numbers come in. They'll never 100% accurate. say is, point view- we're getting quicker go forward expect continue. live lockdown rest lives? pubs restaurants crowds sporting events ever again? happens I'm living world. Yup. IIRC already sampling LA tests due surge LA. Throwing flag here.

Not best choice scenario dust explosion possible. even accounted model building codes type situation.

The International Building Code (IBC) International Fire Code (IFC) common model building codes states cities base adopt use part city state code system. See IFC codes 903.2.1 calls required sprinkler system, also chapter 28 specifically written woodworking requires explosion venting specific wiring equipment complying NFPA 70 (National Electrical Code) pertaining dust explosions. enforce IBC references IFC.

So yes. room next door may need concern.

Two Gentlemen Corona Yes bad can't. definite number amount asymptomatic cases CDC said official number anywhere close actual one testing limits many people without even knowing. What? gained COVID 19 yet? Anecdotal Vitamin lowest number &amp; still normal (I don’t go sun I’ve squamous &amp; melanoma). So, barely acceptable (via blood tests). 
I got covid Feb. Light case (pink eye, exhaustion, head rushes, heart palpitations, gaspy). low &amp; light case. J&amp;J vaccine giving blue balls AZ let bs result. Sure 70% ok fuck. need one big companies come solve issue. longer locate source. apologies. spend lot time reading articles r/Coronavirus I’m bad keeping track sources.

However, tell Pfizer vaccine stop infectivity.

Pfizer mRNA vaccine. contain dead disabled version novel coronavirus. Pfizer vaccine provides artificially engineered genetic blueprint. blueprint gets absorbed cells transported ribosome. ribosome begins constructing spike proteins based upon genetic blueprint. mRNA permenant wash system, meaning it’s permenantly altering genetics making produce spike proteins rest life.

The spike protein thing pointy bits corona coronavirus. spike protein completely harmless. However, novel coronavirus uses spike protein it’s method bind cell receptors infect cell viral genetic material triggers cell produce viruses bursts.

By giving body temporary blue print construct spike proteins. teaches immune system combat spike protein. body view spike proteins foreign object triggers immune response body begins problem solving resolve (eliminate) foreign bodies.

Meaning ever get infected novel coronavirus, body knows produce antibodies destroys spike protein (rendering coronavirus utterly disabled unable infect cells). 

The issue though catch COVID. It’s going take body days build enough appropriate antibodies fully squash infection. well lingering virus mouth/eye/nose area don’t make deep enough body eliminated antibodies. Meaning still infectious transmit virus also hosting immunity.

This Pfizer vaccine. two viable vaccines created using different methods. familiar enough methods state vaccines would eliminate infectivity, high hopes one 3 vaccines either significantly reduce eliminate time immune person infectious others around them.

Since couldn’t provide source, take grain salt. Sorry can’t produce source you’re interested. strongly encourage looking science behind vaccines truly fascinating. issue Kamala said media portrayed it? ""suffer""
Yikes spoiled shit America we. Hehe we're danger Vaccinations literally started 2/3 weeks ago limited doses available Vaccinations initially slow. There's whole load logistical issues iron especially since pfizer vaccine quite hard distribute due ultra cold storage makes even harder compared vaccines. imagine take time Vaccinations significantly ramp especially doses become available vaccines get approved(J&amp;J Oxford etc).

Whilw public vaccination good example, idea pain side effects misleading bound create suspicion. Pfizer Moderna vaccine side effects commonly experienced including pain injection (limiting movement), fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, fever / chills. typically resolve days expected allergic reaction vaccine.

We’re never going eradicate COVID. enough people vaccinated healthcare system overload goes away continue living normal lives without fear. Sure small percentage people still catch even smaller percentage die won’t enough continue living like now. idea Ireland needs. I’m assuming know. also think unlike US, people get financial support lockdowns. EU screwed up, individual countries multiple numbers floating around. article 11,636 adults, 131 (1.1%) symptomatic COVID-19 14 days second vaccine dose, including 30 5,807 (0.5%) COVID-19 vaccine group 101 5,829 (1.7%) control group, indicating vaccine efficacy 70%.

""70%"" also cited number, along phrase ""up 90%"".

It depends read data. It'd also correct say vaccine ""90%"" effective mentioned number derived administering error participants older 55 ""90%"" data.

Though ask exactly 62% 70% exactly derived. publish what's get repeatedly cited. need read paper. wouldn’t. isn’t ideal place it. isn’t place allowed live. Yes. think implicit reply. AstraZeneca fucked up. FDA change rules then. question going live that?

I also think Covid mindset treating every person know like could kill extremely psychologically damaging. sure adults going get past that, let alone kids learning brain development years. Psychiatric problems usually lifelong. *would* yes, people took seriously. He’s really though. Yes he’s huge asshole politics reflect attitude country you’d think.

Teenagers problem. matter? like reporting number 9000, saying ""oh btw, that's since march really matter"". 1000 people study. 500 get real 500 get placebo.

After 3 months check see many people symptoms tested positive COVID. example 100 people positive, 80 placebo group, know vaccine effective.

That means 16% placebo group positive. 4% vaccinated.

The exact efficacy percentage calculated like this: ( 16% - 4% ) / 16% * 100 equals 75%.

That number means vaccine reduces *risk* getting COVID 75% compared getting vaccine.

If don’t placebo group, don’t know compare against. hypotheses origin, even speculative?  Thanks Pal! made exact point.

Even sequenced 53 day CA, would .3% daily cases sequenced, nowhere close UK's 10% sequenced, definitely nowhere near enough find significant statistical trends. stands, 53 sequenced like .001% less CA cases since December. believe everything fake, never deal reality. Thats world people live on. must UK strain right Well obviously gonna able make another vaccine mRNA tech vaccines made COVID, maybe SARS isn’t vaccine available that. That’s point new technology gone thru testing procedures. 

I’m sure 10 years you’re speaking exaggerated know vaccines usually take years produce. already listed vaccines take long, it’s monitor long term issues, get ENOUGH evidence make sure it’s safe first place. Something like getting cancer years taking shot vaccines work. vaccine likely system 2 months, taught immune system fight COVID point.

You also keep mind fact strain coronavirus already known many decades reason able speed process making vaccine account multiple article helps ease worries Redditors laughing /r/worldnews backwards people attacking MSF doctors nurses.

Meanwhile similar disaster strikes US Americans respond way. America never chance virus. We’re people, we’re dollar signs. PR thing spot on.
