Technically legally EU ability so. chosen so.

And UK US exporting anything - pointing great benefactors world know Pfizer deal reason you’re low vaccination rates today. 

Disagree. blame fully AZ. AZ fucked royally dishonest day 1 (prior commitments APA) - evident would able deliver promises spectacular fashion could saved lives telling EC straight productions issues. would allow EU contract additional doses manufacturers.

Unfortunately cost lives cost lives near future.

Where EC fuck up? Trusting business partner much. Hopefully they've learned lesson. lady never tells age. kids went back school masks, dividers, bring laptops. much happier, socialized. Personalities returning full bloom, socialization light years different. fair compare, imho. everyone got paid sick time hard speak hypotheticals know 45 would done. Biden aggressive vaccine rollout. Really, solution ending pandemic. 

Trump's covid response poor. yeah, deserve credit sure. wondering symptoms vaccines correlate exposed someone's body real virus. Exactly, can’t mandate EUA wife got flu last year. took six months recover fully. suspect would bad time COVID. daughter shown issues inflammation prior, we're concerned MIS-C, matter ""rare"" said be.

Sorry, nothing we're waiting worth long term health. Taking year bit activities big inconvenience means might able circumvent first endemic airborne blood/vascular disease society faced. I’m hoping side effects get less dose. side effects first second. also get monthly migraines feel way described head splitting open definitely don’t want extra days future doses. I’ve read moderna experimenting smaller dose sizes since twice size Pfizer’s hopefully they’re successful leads fewer side effects. GSK British. wasn’t issue them, weren’t interested. 

The initial proposed partner Merck &amp; Co. American, concern Trump seizing vaccines meant government blocked it. last heard, 18 people died CVST / similar clotting disorders + low platelets appears associated Oxford-AZ vaccine. far, life-threatening indeed cases fatal events clustered among **younger** people received particular vaccine.

if there's similar problem J+J, would perhaps juuuust beginning surface data based number J+J doses given.

so yes. death associated vaccination &amp; happen.

to put another way, could protect everybody USA world smallpox bioterrorism vaccinating them, smallpox vaccine high rate gnarly side effects. don't. Damn well better Ok, sure trolling. Sheesh, find something better time. Lockdowns never supposed long term solution. whole point flatten curve hospitals could catch vaccine. Getting vaccine always way end pandemic, putting efforts toward crucial. 

Israel got right early on. Vaccinate many quickly possible.

False positive? Unlucky 5%? family member got AstraZeneca shot said experienced fever chills overnight. got Sinovac (the vaccine currently use Philippines) hospital works higher blood pressure afterwards.

Good thing lockdown call ambulance, clearly blacked rest message.

Considering even pre-schoolers understand percentages cake, surely idea percentages work? mean seem get much far... nothing, gotta figure squash boosters. Idk I'll signing boosters every six twelve months literally lose night sleep, wide awake crying bed head feels like split open.

It’s definitely 10x+ makes absurd lump together Sources. Obligatory « got vaccine » post :)) Pfizer 10 hours ago, perfectly fine couple hours ago - injection site increasingly sore, much much less tetanus shot. Second dose 3 weeks. Feeling nice psychological bump, like, hey, maybe consider may able go see movie months :) Well see can’t send kids back children haven’t approved vaccine yet. likely later year, can’t possibly send back booster shots needed keep variants every six months. everyone them. need consider variants could possibly evade vaccines.

People don’t work, can’t produce children, people dependent definition dispensable.  Shut WHO. You’ve said enough already, Noone cares say, spouting nonsense everytime ? 

The recovered also immunity hell? verifiable facts. 
Your argument full fallacy. 

Do research say. 

You dislike Trudeau reasons evoked, doesn’t change fact production facilities. US banned exports (we H1N1 (?) it’s fair guess). lucky EU exports also banned. Mine quick check in, wait shot. 

My issue rural Walgreens choose get appointment none pharmacy techs properly wearing mask. doesn’t get shot work day following day off?

Most people know didn’t symptoms 12 hours, symptoms cleared 24 hours. depend state imo, hardly see schools southern states requiring masks letting full capacity stadiums indoors outdoors. why? 1. paid vast majority sum vaccines
2. pay rest, technicality account political party blowing meeting money transfer supposed get rubber stamped. rescheduled. Definitely bad look though. 1 100,000 high incidence rate something serious. Obviously Canada could better - moment, 17% population received least one dose.

Source:  responsible distribution within state? may cause 1-2 day delay people, rescheduling. guess may little shuffling supply among sites, get one-shot J&amp;J mobile units vaccinating farm workers. would surprising, much herd immunity success riding getting workers vaccinated asap. flooding central valley soon bring crops. Source? family currently working conversation. correct answer easy... much harder admit commit many. guy know 81 82, mother hit 100 looks better spunky 100, sharp knife still. 56.3% + 6.9% (tested) recovered top likely % top recovered tested. closer 65%.  exactly this, I've got friends reason want think worthy truth is, sites downstate rural areas literally give anyone walks literally years long waiting list get mental health professional :( okay, line kids Oxford-AZ vaccine let's see happens. Israel much smaller population agreed share (medical) data Pfizer. rollout amazing see though. Imagine could replicate across world? exactly okay, line kids Oxford-AZ vaccine let's see happens. kind do... B117 variant kicking original strain curb... There's probably even south-northern-west Los Angeles variant. dangerous mutant, comparable West-karakalpakstan variant. dangerous, borders must close forever, new normal short know sure. 

Probably much long enough want even try something like outside confines carefully monitored trial. UK doesn’t monitor exports like EU AZ send want, nothing magical that.   put little less stock particular survey conducted vaccines available, a) long time ago, latest, early December 2020 b) much less data virtually persuasion campaign waged. almost science works  No, refuse pay them. There's bit government instability one main parties blew government meeting among things supposed rubber stamp latest payment. No, vaccine approved kids, get people calling 'urgent'. Even adults, approved emergency use authorisation, much I'd consider vaccinating risk people emergency, kids definitely not. Due enormous social pressure censorship that's going past year, doubt many doctors actually give personal view opposes what's approved thing say, know. death rate lower developed countries population growth recently slowed. part younger population. population denominator, big bulge 20 40 age group moves Quality Control unit seems working fine, need cast doubt them. things going happen. Human beings working long hours. Mistakes inevitable. could've/should've used beginning anyone &lt;60 y/o imo, antibody test first, see get shot majority people form protection stop spread, since (at least US) basically anyone able get first shot next weeks dont really see done point. Pfizer 600 significant figures? 600,000? Seems incredibly confusing. ya getting divorce? answers:

idk article takes recovered % from. Israeli gov tracks recovered, get vaccinated detracted recovered count added vaccinated.

Real numbers 56.3% vaccinated (at least 1 dose), top 6.9% recovered vaccinated. That's official Israeli health ministry publication, see Total number recovered (vaccinated unvaccinated) found [official gov COVID 835k, 9% population (hence idea take 15% asymptomatic infections, missed testing? 

Israel highest testing rate world throughout pandemic, furthermore despite early thoughts asymptomatic cases, later studies found rare.

Still I'd expect top 835k (9%) detected recovered, there'd 4-6% additional recovered tested. Many statistically probably got vaccinated.

We kind assume herd immunity Israel month now. Virtually everything open. massive street parties thousands people cases gone up. 15,000 people strong packed demonstrations cases gone up. family based holiday country gathered groups 15-30 (Israeli families large) still cases gone up.

Sports events, theaters, restaurants, gyms, pubs, clubs concerts happening. Schools open person. Still cases still declining. Saskatchewan currently covid mess. Atlantic Canada done well though. That’s great service. Thank part. aware that:
1. know expensive kilobytes. There’s reason we’ve able send 2MM messages 500k last 24 hours. 
2. you’re using long codes (full telephone numbers) isn’t fully legal. 
3. might wrong side hipaa laws since identifiable information (phone numbers). permanently changed labeled national threat US. really. Federal law takes precedence. Yea seriously, honestly know quick could go wanting perfectly fine taking actually learning it. Definitely gonna share info whenever see people talking worries them.  course not, doesn’t mean I’m going give credibility wild prediction. Travel businesses must obey state federal law, like every business. 

Carnival Corp Florida business. buildings employees Florida, subject Florida laws.  ships leave harbor, ticket-selling happens land.

When state federal laws conflict, puts business impossible situation. details article lack Kentucky’s larger vaccination sites reported “thousands” open vaccine slots month, including University Kentucky’s site Kroger Field. Additionally next week, Kentucky Horse Park 1,800 openings; Louisville’s Cardinal Stadium 11,000 openings; Greenwood Mall Bowling Green 2,000; Pikeville Medical Center Christian County Health Department 1,000 openings. far good?  20k? Open doors windows approved filters would probably effective. school day 1. good US doing, could UK levels per capita prioritized first doses. 

Instead virus resurgent certain states (see Michigan), they'd practically herd immunity already.

That's going get lost good news, think going shown Fauci et al wrong dogmatically stick short booster schedule. Exactly. careful offend (politicking) instead right short amount time. everyone hates talking about?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* agree this. Canada realatively well pandemic hard work persistiance local population. something proud of. 

Vaccines different though. can't make vaccine industry thin air matter hard work. much do. Larger countries larger economies always advantage this. exceptions Israel &amp; UK managed get ahead special deals politics get vaccines places first. worked EU allowed export despite putting people disadvantage.

Canada dependent US export vaccines left luck noticed month ago. Esp. daily discussion thread. Instead constanly searching internet worldwide covid news, coming year saddens me.

A moderator AMA last week(?) think things, want search pinned areas. got Moderna upset stomach 24 hours. vaccines effect everyone differently. way Canadians USA remain states incur tax penalty? fully vaccinated still pay quarantine, etc upon returning home. make anti science backstory want, one agrees this. Show link anywhere single scientist saying healthy 16 year olds prioritized first. need vaccinate kids

""We need vaccinate cats dogs!""

It's going ""general consensus"" means, know there's going one lone epidemiologist says gets media attention. Teachers potentially going strike Ireland, vaccinate first. fest happening age based system falling apart. though 1. greatly reduces chance I’ll get sick pass on, even doesn’t completely eliminate it.
2. far currently know completely eliminates chance getting seriously ill myself. honestly want find out? Seeing science hero present time really cool. Someday, they'll talking alongside Marie Curie. Mostly lockdown, vaccination Realistically everyone Pfizer shot (or another vaccine listing Pfizer cause good trials) quite impossible COVID get around.

This lot easier achieve college campuses people made get shot want go school general public always group people committed public endangerment. need cry internet, im u bro. kids get flu shots every year stakes too. Nope, either want everything open far soon all. hell coming century pandemic bit caution. /s  vaccinated American I’m still feeling pretty happy days one dose, followed second 12 weeks later saved many lives.

It also took good deal cooperation people worried getting 3 weeks later save neighbor. Well eyes policymakers rest world, overall disagreed Sweden's strategy, there's way looking big outlier - outcomes policy would gold mine information would extremely useful analyzing differences policy. Hence, ""experiment"". Yes, calling experiment interpreted Sweden running experiment disrespectful. Canadian, upset country handled situation. vaccine rollout unmitigated disaster! already smell general consensus end pandemic going from:

We need complete lockdown! need vaccinate older population! need make sure every adult vaccinated! need vaccinate kids

sigh.... should, fair. Also, there's faster way get run office telling citizens we've produced tons perfectly good vaccine, we're going send somewhere else instead giving you. Indians coming Canada recently caught fake tests.

Edit:

Maybe Indians assumed. source Oh, yes. super tragic, combination driver kids (they bolted across green looking one lane stopped them, driver wondering lane stopped). horrible. 

Don't stop traffic nice, let signaling thing. predictable. Quite close calls light taps lit entire intersection posted signs keep driving stop let people cross. It’s already available New York adults, Cornell is. Canada's weather funny al ot places cold winter hot humid summer.

Florida takes cake sure.
But Toronto gets 90-100f range 60-80% humidity often summer  I.e. lockdowns restrictions rather cranking vacc.

Canada really infrastructure place produce vaccines (the reason much deeper political issue stretches back well pandemic anyone's mind). simply cannot snap fingers ta-da vaccine production infrastructure, Canada actually working one largest producers novavax end year. money problem scaling issue. Respectfully, base particular comment.

What US historically right US's alley logistics... program like OWS effective, take money proportional Canada's GDP simply effective Canada. think us understand phenomenon properly person dedicated life RNA viruses Retroviruses.

What I'm saying here: ""ifs"" can't ruled out. completely reprehensible make vaccines mandatory.  hate guy believe let cruises sail vaccinated passengers starting May 31. going need carrots get vaccinations 50 percent US got J&amp;J Tuesday. slept lot Tuesday afternoon/evening little fatigued Wednesday. arm really sore that's it. 

I think people wildly different reactions vaccines. I'm sorry shitty experience.... least round two like vaccines. Hope feel better soon! UK's policy trying get many first doses possible people exchange delaying second also dragging numbers way there. Getting 80% effective vaccine 80% population instead 95% effective 40% population amount time (gross oversimplification, know) stop spread.  mom really bad reaction first dose (Moderna) thus far, 12 hours in, reaction second.

BUT, got first dose, week separated actually recovering COVID. purely anecdotal among small sample one specific metropolitan area, doctor told situation first dose bad one he's observed patients received Moderna recently actual Covid infection. got free tshirt, don’t tell HR would gotten nothing. see argument. fact, maybe LTCF could sued employing worker refused vax subsequently infected patient. Management duty protect fragile elderly clientele. Hiring anti-vaxers could seen assuming obvious risk. 

I still bit confused though. patients vaccinated, still considered risk? Initially unknown effective vaccinations actually were, typically claimed virtually hospitalizations deaths occurred post vaccination. seems developing news CDC etc makes point even stronger.

Perhaps eventually come consensus risk two unvaccinated people. doubt we're yet. million NZers overseas. many MIQ spots ?

The way increase planes flying directly Whenuapai sort tented city. saying Canada half assed vaccine purchases? Canada ordered enough doses population many times over. wait arrive, problem. domestic manufacturing capabilities that. I’m honestly shocked say schools started random testing, 14.9% tests came back positive. That’s twice high community rates running NC. ....sure? makes say that? Masks low cost. Wow nuts. Interesting. It’s mixed bag, Sweden got similar death rates European average (although higher Scandinavian neighbors), less stress strict restrictions. Also, deaths elder facilities seem skewed death tolls up, specific portion policy.

Maybe giving general common sense advice let people figure things worked? policy seems something like “Preferably stay apart others, eh don’t trust masks magic; staying apart real failproof measure. sometimes want meet people, that’s okay safe often... \*have\* stay people, okay wear masks” (this last part came much later)

It’s possible policies strict countries caused sectors population revolt go crazy make things worse. Also, allowing occasional, safer gathering mental sanity could helped – health issues people seem related isolation coronavirus per se. Yeah, absolutely discount number also-credentialed people disagree single individual. There’s vaccine herpes?  trump president new Zealand now? swear sometimes sub people want pandemic last forever *“Their starting point was, let’s much compromise required get minimal cooperation China,” said Jamie Metzl, senior fellow Atlantic Council think tank, led drafting process letter.*

How know that? pure speculation there.

Then read ""think tank led draft letter..."".

So basically scientists call new probe. Atlantic Think Tank calling new probe.

Right.  Depends bit Canada are. Saskatchewan done pretty well managing Covid. Atlantic Canada, things pretty good. example, Nova Scotia five new cases today, involving people travelled outside province self isolated upon return. total forty active cases. executive order matter since cruises follow federal rules.

Just like ban mask mandates apply airport public transportation.  possible gotten actual covid last year point? I’ve seen real rough side effects happen you’ve infected real thing vaccine support parents protecting kids. kids, can't imagine mental toll taking them. 

It's important remember risk ""at risk"" child =/= risk ""at-risk"" adult. 

Same thing diabetic 30 year-old vs diabetic 80 year-old. risk every age level increases, without comorbidities. kids asthma obese kids significant risk, we'd seeing kids die left right-- lot kids conditions. 

But seeing way older people. 

Has anyone seen good data IFR kids, broken comorbidity? 

I would letting kids live normal life unless actively receiving chemo something. Chinese vaccines Missing /s there? close now. (I'm referring kids crosswalk.) Kentucky like 40 percent vaccinated vaccines open everyone 58 percent got used last week. great sign. wonder still tells lol Canadians Reddit. Canadians know personally. saw pretty consistently. I’m glad see wasn’t prevailing sentiment definitely tanked opinion Canada honest. said “not much risk.” doesn’t read “not many kids die,” reads “they don’t face serious risk.” implies kids get sick covid kids face serious outcomes getting sick. YMMV think that’s fair interpretation. know family member die condition saw someone describe condition posing “not much risk” would find accurate. they’re trying say kids die it’s rare, say that. Keep AZ coming! agree. 300 cruise ships world, belching diesel smoke, especially port. 3,000 cases nation 126 million? That's essentially zero. problem Japan. Meanwhile, USA dead coronavirus every week. Math must hard you. new documentary YouTube hospitals Brazil. Nurses interviewed saying people sick current variant previously sick earlier variant last year. None died though... That's thing. People mistrusted Russian vaccine. seems good far. Also, lot countries either thought good lockdowns would enough need spend money, like Brazil herd immunity natural infection answer.

Both types countries currently scrambling. can. worry since taking long vaccinate entire world might mutate again. know two people went today encountered issue taking anymore walk ups. solution? Go phones website make appointment could get instead trying later.

But yeah, vaccine site great. got two pfizer shots times really simple even drive took little hour first shot early March. second dose last week near literally drive able drive straight check area. first dose likewise told people sign since check point stopped taking appointments finished Pfizer doses switched J&amp;J. headlines now.

Many die, well 1 pool Denver. students vacced mingling, US safer overall even it’s months. really think you’ll fine. Lasting effects covid serious varied. die, mean getting flu. 

It's great die (seriously) living rest life damaged lungs (for ex) still big concern. mean right there's denying explain people like finished even want hear hear anymore they'd rather buy Facebook s*** deal reality like half people live building like oh affect kids know believe real wear masks matter like. feel like even though yes eventually getting going get get half population hold last little bit ?

Healthcare workers exposed lot virus work, got past maybe front line workers I’d imagine rather strong correlation people won’t get vaccinated people refused abide restrictions. hopefully decent amount natural immunity among refusing vaccine. He's one weirdos think lockdowns control crazy people stuff. make asshole? Amazing insanely sensitive people here. Almost like it’s everyone’s job take everything personally. Sad funny mean pretty much data. It’s overwhelmingly safe.

700,000,000 doses given out. **will** see relevant side effects numbers, unless side effect happening like 1/100,000,000 times, case... nobody going care 80-160 people **on Earth** might problem ultimately.

From mathematical perspective vaccines **insanely** safe. tell already. Early 2000’s: “Free WiFi”

I call bullshit Hm, long Pfizer? thought Astra Zeneca. Keep stretching arm..... get kinda sore like 24 hrs.. side effect had... got second one kept stretching every 20 min sore all. Israel ate vegetables, get dessert. lot people somewhere ""give vaccine asap"" ""I'll never take vaccine"" think that's lot we're seeing. article points people worried side effects, side effects terrible, see concerned take day work someone else care kids needed to.

There's also lot people going go way get one - they'll get walk pharmacy street get shot time, going bother signing up, driving mass site (that may trek), waiting line, etc etc. end world, deterrent worried getting sick.

Ultimately, think we're starting see next phase vaccine distribution, steady stream scramble available slot we've experienced now. user saying even case likely survive Yep. agree; there'll lot people vaccinated go, lot people who're willing take risk. fault them. I'm objecting flat statement anyone wants vaccination get one. fel like March world Past worst covid over, seems worst.

I feel sad everyone Brazil, stay safe! vaccines coming done great job March getting shots arms Canadians. also know navigate restrictions better safer. stay patient follow protocols going get finish line sooner later.  disagree comment, nothing assholish comment replied to. stance whole time. husband hospitalized? one going help take care sick kids. Certainly is! India 5 times many people. USA Brazil world cup biggest COVID fuckups.

Yeah think either. Especially airlines trying get back type normalcy people confident flying way Putin realize Bolsonaro doesn’t get together virus inevitably exported Russia Even second dose, get overly complacent.

Brazil number 17 according worldmeters, maybe escalate soon nobody cares there.  no, get sent school dosed Tylenol would pass temp checks anyways. Around lunchtime little kids start feeling well &amp; admit sick yesterday too. past years worked like clockwork. whenever get ahold adult pick they’ve interacted half building. 

It’s definitely better year thanks threats quarantine, illustrates many families options childcare school isn’t there. True, velocity opposite. Two cars going speed one might headed cliff thought dumb brother would ever drive near. 

As american feeling confident moment real breath fresh air (36, 1 dose in, low stable community rate). wife type person infect multiple people disease got vaccinated impatient wait another week two whatever inane bs ""had"" do? 

People like likely lots issues thinking ""adverse reactions"" people acceptable risk fight global pandemic. fool /s kind test? Rapid antigen PCR?

If wasn’t PCR safely assume wrong. Yeah medics. Got father law done FEMA site asked infantry laughed. 

Second comments efficiency. model perfection. Made proud brought there. told everyone it, lol. 756 Poland 212 Czechia sure looks like that. wait... OMG think thinking? C word? need resident get KY? disagree I'm reiterating fact free market.... I'd even go far say vaccine development **shouldn't** privatized neither healthcare that's entire additional worms. worked day first Pfizer. big deal. Thanks response, I'll answer question.

1. Yes, texts .75 cents per message. user sent one text, removed database. I'm planning putting google ads even cost gets traffic. And, I'll donate excess money. costs get high though, I'll shut down.

2. I'm using Twilio send messages think Twilio would exist illegal, could wrong. think apply I'm sending one text, mass texting:

Thanks pointing out, really dark legal side. We’re obviously going agree anything you’re probably going keep going long I’m gonna hop off. fun opinion vaccine. Really point arguing we’ll see better accurate data year come he’s really paranoid tell get tested. 1. Thank God end. 2. take long CDC update guidance???  percentage includes population kids can’t take yet Yeah, got 101 fever headache bad enough able sleep, tylenol broke quick enough felt fine. Otherwise symptoms besides tiredness, fever always makes tired stop tired stops, headache left soon enough. Bitter much? cares long people get vaccinated. What's wrong optimism? Colleges schools shut since March 2020 And, KY, dozens appointments spare enough people signing (16+ allowed now). Tax antivax see long openings last. Better yet, require vax card form voter ID see long takes southern R's howl. ability save millions lives around world, reduce risk increasingly horrible variants Covid developing, choose want get rich, piece shit. 

Nobody saying companies developed vaccine make profit. issue prioritizing profit far prioritizing ending global Covid pandemic. 

Governments force make IP public, would allow vaccine doses produced far quickly, affordably poorer nations. governments still ensure companies make reasonable return investment well. 

Our global political/economic system prioritizes financial well-being small number people work vaccine manufacturers, ending probably biggest global catastrophe since WWII. Lol. No, send thoughts prayers. Took J&amp;J today! One done. Two hours later don’t feel thing would probably round whole percent. still wear masks forever cool right? Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think they’ve somehow bribed hundreds thousands coroners across entire US (as around 2500-3000 deaths reported VAERS).

Yeah. way. one stories makes stop think. Endless admiration? Yes. true hero. Thank Katalin Kariko'. think underestimate vaccine hesitancy across America. would surprised see retrospective study find correlation political party alignment/Trump support previous vaccine hesitancy, ie county level rate vaccine hesitancy prior SARS-CoV-2 acting independent variable rates political party affiliation acting mediating variable. Poland Czechia? people faint injection described “COVID senioritis”. Oh agree you, wanted say anxiety disorder like next level anxiety compared anxiety folks experience. lot people downvoting understand severity actual anxiety disorder. like telling alcoholic, ""Simple, drink"". think can’t sway coroners decision naive honest ""not rich"" countries better rich ones terms vaccine distribution coverage. 

Bhutan, Chile, Morocco, Uruguay, Turkey better EU even better UK. 

For variants, sure; suspect still better reduce spread vaccine worldwide instead locally spread exponential reducing curve also reduce variants. think math model.

Generally vaccine used virus spread more, limit variants. hope so. would probably also take AZ young male, think risk low people like me. want wait 12 weeks fully vaccinated (which soon probably means able travel). prefer mRNA reason. Looking hospitalization data? lol 
And maybe live here, see total collapse? ""Smallwood said despite concern case numbers, deaths seemed plateaued increased slightly, rate infections. Imperial College London study found strong evidence UK’s vaccine programme breaking link cases fatalities."" You’re one getting works. *Reported cases* *lagging* indicator infections, real-time count. meaningful comparison determining works better trend, tells us what’s going charts telling us happened 10 days diff then? actually opposite, ok.

Both sexes shit thrown shouldn't. USA 11th place comes deaths American south bit true, Canadian US cultures similar think. Man, antimask antivaxxers aren’t anyone favours. sucks makes easier make fake vaccine cards pull lot numbers social media. clear, fully agree great policy US domestically, hope US pay years ahead. Unfortunately, think lot interests US countries (like Southeast Asia, Central Africa, Western South America) sympathetic non-US interests going forward. Canadian here. We're struggling. I've fan public healthcare now. Czech Republic easily wins one. people infected per capita. death per capita (even microstates) Every attendee staff member download health pass mobile app prior entry, allow user link either vaccination record lab test results demonstrate vaccinated tested negative COVID-19.
Masks mandated use COVID-19 scent-detection dogs considered, among safety provisions. king queen total babes too. That’s neither there, go Bhutan, way win every front. really care bad men. Women protected society get articles like restrictions lifted Jan,Feb cases decreased. Annoying robo voice calling people stopped. couple festivals combined elections handful states many people gathered 0 masks. couple sports matches 0 masks. People basically forgot COVID became complacent. Even cases started rising less 10k 20-30k, people didn’t start wearing masks people Govt didn’t care much became 60-70k cases/day 100,000/day. 

Tldr: People acted like COVID I'm starting company soon. blackjack hookers! combined mutations. Whether means combined abilities yet ben assessed.  generic. selfish specifically two, US UK. 

The EU countries (for political reasons, avoid discrimination inside union) decided share organization vaccine campaign. mess sure selfish mess.

Also EU block export. limit export countries (like Australia) better shape. makes sense. Yes, Germany already cold me, want go anywhere equally cold colder. I'm happy Germany, maybe spread optimism :) Haha I'm lucky enough dual German/American citizenship feel like weird insight worlds. always popular position though😂 gorgeous country, please know we’re pulling get this. Men default. Every article unless explicitly saying otherwise them.  2024 lmao Money helps definitely end all, especially European affairs. look US failure Iran deal. Europe literally built SWIFT system (INSTEX) bypass US sanctions Iran. Credibility matters US dug hole little deeper. Again, great domestic policy days ago news said 400,000 doses sitting freezers province. zero reason many sitting around. certainly sections Danish society covid fatigue (the recent numbers actually show people's reaction winter's/spring's lockdown similar, even better, year ago), saying ever anything like riots incorrect. fairly regular demonstrations Copenhagen, perhaps month last half year, usually hundred people (infrequently reaching around one thousand) pretty much consist group people refer name Men Black. extremely demonstrations elsewhere, couple Aalborg &lt;100 people couple Aarhus 'larger' reached hundred people despite literally arranging busses parts country. demonstrations essentially peaceful; worst thing happened people throwing fireworks minor incidents easily handled police. So, pretty small (the fact even largest they've unable get around thousand remarkable), they've rioty. Well pardon analogy find idea trying help neighbor put house fire also running back forth trying put *own* fire better plan. 

And insofar dependability goes, previous administration epitome ineptitude, setting goal vaccinations succeeding exceeding goal. *does* send message USA can, least, manage affairs regards pandemic. *IS* marked contrast previous administration. 

Plus achieving goals swiftly, exporting demand US population drops off, bad strategy. UK pandemic. manufauring least three different vaccines Well, I'm US, might wrong, I'd say culture plays quite role. Canadians seem bit civilized abiding law orders. covid, plays huge role.

All people know make private small parties 5-10 people. Smart people stupid people alike. many people know Balkans... quite lot following orders mood, say. European, guy gets it. US reliable vaccines citizens first? would never trust country exports vaccines vaccinating population. Thanks feedback--I'll talk Hausarzt today.

That site's valid Bavaria unfortunately. signed Bavarian site months ago, ask enough questions capture fact *household* there's someone who's high risk. I'm bottom list based age, probably. Let's see happens via Hausarzt though... Yep, today, small quantity EU blocked export. 

And still irrational Australia much better shape countries worldwide. CANZUK thing probably. Mexico, South Africa even EU?

EU exported (at least) 11M doses UK. UK return favor 50% British covered? cited it? That's literally article highlights. 

[Here's graph fact. Good luck that. France breeding ground antivaxxers, homeopathy, crackpot trends. bc too? Ontario mass incompetence top: kinds community initiatives ready go, vaccines delivered feds, province absolutely fucking every way possible. wild Sweden too. Healthy adults scheduled eligible vaccine August. Except nothing ever shut down, well bars restaurants close 8:30. 

In March lots student parties, mostly Flogsta neighborhood. found cases South African Brazilian variant, whole mess sister faints shots. faints finger prick. almost faints anybody talking blood. People like sometimes. course *never* tease it. can't even compare anything - even Europe. Germany class and, surprise, comparing nothing, best. everything. always smartest, fastest, handsome guy room alone. 

(If going compare anything Europe, can't even start argue Canada same.) Thanks feedback--I'll talk Hausarzt today.

The Bavarian website ask enough questions put higher age group, I've heard absolutely nothing since then. I'm one illness--it's roommate is. let's see happens. stop beating dog? yet, little year ago, told administration fine, need masks, needed wash hands stay safe. There's way respiratory virus airborne, right? Right?  European Court Human Rights (ECHR) backed rules Czech Republic banning unvaccinated children schools judgment may broader implications debate mandatory jabs decided vote sixteen one excluding unvaccinated children permissible “protective” measure classmates rather “punitive” one objective every child protected serious diseases, vaccination virtue herd immunity,” Strasbourg, France-based court said Thursday. “The Czech health policy could, therefore, said consistent best interests children ruling could become political fodder societies argue whether vaccination coronavirus mandated law, whether children receive vaccine. people always say spreading COVID prolong pandemic? happened “flatten curve” charts hammered us beginning this.

New, infectious variants. trend observed across entire world. think moral argument could prolong pandemic given. 

First US higher rate covid world vaccines would impact say Japan.

Second try evenly spread vaccine worldwide it'll take much longer overall get herd immunity would keep virus dangerous people longer time. probably much better get herd immunity smaller geographic locations moving on. there's tons variables here. 

Poorer nations actually hit hard expect due combination factors including younger populations less likely serious case, lower obesity diabetes incidence, lower mobility depending nation lower population density. Looking data I'd say many countries reach 20% end year. It’s hard see everyday health people get vaccine America risk health care workers countries can’t get vaccine. also lead first world economics rapidly grow furthering wealth gap. don’t understand don’t allow countries make supply. perfectly capable J&amp;J factory IP laws can’t make buy. Greedy fucks count it. first dose Moderna gave worst side effects vaccine point. thought maybe covid that's bad. got second dose, side effects 10x worse. bedridden 48 hours afterwards.

Don't get wrong, I'm still glad able get vaccine. side effects temporary. people still prepared worst. Useful headline that. I'll eligible week I'm checking myturn.ca.gov site ever day make appointments day qualify. parents sister working food agriculture got it, checked ID's...no documents sister :/ part kinda want get with.  People considered young hospitals they’re 60 True went footlocker yesterday couldn’t even hand shoe worker

I put shoe stool would pick up. stupid Soft power chocolate teapot.

Money rules everything. Several factors, one storage temperature, another strict priorisation scheme (us GPs pragmatic bunch would vaccinated 79 yo wife 81 yo husband well come together), end reckon also security concerns. ban least 10 people practice ""Anti-Corona""-radicals (""Querdenker"") refused follow simplest rules like showing normal operation times 40°C fever waiting room full normal/healthy people, wearing mask etc. fairly sure deluded idiots (sorry, term seems appropriate) might radicalised thinking blowing vaccination center practice something helping population, unhappy beginning started vaccinations police protection. Since turns vaccines fact install 5G turn zombie rish lowered now, albeit still entirely gone.

The head local ""Anti-Corona""-movement died due - might guess - Corona got infected demonstration protesters refused wear masks, reduced Querdenker local area least bit, security risk still zero. Also might theft since people REALLY want get vaccinated quickly... I'm still gonna keep clean. nice catching flu such... 25% American adults say absolutely never get vaccine. going linearly increase. going logarithmic massively slow get begging pleading people get vaccine. really doubt we'll ever get 70% adults. 65% probably close limit. capacity (500k) supply (over 600k jabs yesterday) looks like now, come getting close? Friend mine got jab Munich last week fill like 14 pages paper one ever look at. think it’s nuanced personally. immediate short term sense benefits US vaccinate population first. logic assumes don’t live highly interconnected world. long game choosing immediate gain could hurt diplomatic relations, like comment replying to, could also mean pandemic prolonged nations can’t afford/ don’t access vaccines. Obviously sending vaccines country citizens continue get sick die also difficult sell politically though. Overall think places need viewing pandemic less bounded terms, global community rather sovereign states. doesn’t give much optimism future challenges cannot learn this. Nah bitter lot Canadians shitting Americans online 

When mostly love northern neighbors  That's China objectively better job western countries year. western chauvinism reddit gotten much blatant lately. care get voted, rest world pretty ugly see country almost nothing control de virus, vaccination fast pace.
Imagine poor kid gets see rich drunk irresponsible kid gets new car one destroyed. amazing NY large jewish population resistant even taking vacine due beliefs &amp; conspiracy theories vaccine. Yet Israel achieved herd immunity awesome. got covid still suffering side effects happy hear finally herd immunity achieved somewhere. wonderful report given world. Interesting enough, cdc recommends taking ibuprofen Pfizer shot tho still reach goal least one dose everyone October...........that October 2025. Well actually don’t need MD vaccinate Easter MDs couldn’t order practices. vaccine available vaccination Centers hospitals That's true. requirement, goal Netherlands has. kiddos think vaccine put chip body government knows location time, lmao. one good thing comes Covid hopefully bring Canada's smug superiority complex touch long Wynn fronting cost weekly tests, think fair compromise personal liberty customer safety. thought one net benefits vaccinating large percentage population decouple ""cases"" ""deaths"". cases rise, long people dying, ok. Obligatory “the US share *positive* results past year.” No, like sometime last year didn’t know it. (Asymptomatic light symptoms thought cold etc) Next 92 95 ... variants popping up. Don’t say ‘anyone wants vaccinated July’? That’s much different ‘everyone’. like doesn’t include typical 20-30% ‘skeptics’ well kids. I’m surprise. whole different kind dumb saying correct except ultimately US take care citizens first. We're position circumstances help partenrs since we're rich. one case need vaccinate first.

China Russia sacrificing citizens influence. Let them. tons money buy influence via means need it. Gotten covid vaccine??? I'm sure keep up. Lots profit. don’t get works:

The majority country already this. act like people cooped homes year. point weird ones. Immunity? source Can't really blame NZ step. Situation India good. [There evidence Brazil variant capable Brazil situation infectious, many restrictions. 

Much Brazil story media based Manaus study, calculated almost everyone covid. study based assumption people show donate blood *less* likely covid others, adjusted data upwards, even though donating blood got free antibody test (meaning showed actually *more* likely covid - flu-like symptoms without access covid, surely curious see covid healthy throughout).

I base decisions variants time. could capable reinfecting, evidence weak. Country virtually vaccine manufacturing capacity depends countries vaccines!

Wow really hard hitting stuff EU commission. Perhaps short term, think long term would damage us. 

Remember vaccine supply chains vials. tools, intellectual property, components packaging might come outside EU potentially blocked export EU. isolation boredom

Its rant go R/ukpolitics im kinda sick seeing here. also factually intellectually incorrect question EU would want supplied UK plants AZ EU contractually agreed use. EU what's best people would beer total stop exports. Mississippi allows people state get vaccinated. know people New Orleans going get Mississippi first opened vaccinations smokers 18+. states might ???? I'm sad I'm leaving, I'm also happy I'm getting fuck out. 2 hour meeting unventilated room. one gives shit here. don’t think so, UK simply trying best people, like EU is. 

Arguably, now, UK strategy better - however seems like EU improving effort. 

If AstraZeneca successful rollout, would discussion now. personally appreciate erdoğan's diplomacy. trying Ottomans 2 centuries evenfually collapsing balance policy. US EU dont want go China Russia go back US EU. think US EU side 90 percent time unless something really bad happens. However yes China Russia US EU whatever give vaccine wanna go gym :D [On website says ""Excipient components provided support roll Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 also quite good video explaining add this... I'm also opposed show COVID vaccination go school / college already case many vaccinations. Freedumbs muh rights. I’m Brazilian

I know 3 people died got intubated avoided death

Reinfections reality, know 1 case personally many famous soccer players twice (since get far exposed, games don’t get cancelled often here).

Most us hate Bolsonaro now, chances re-election neglected. 25% people follow hell, goes 2nd turn election next year Lula (most likely scenario currently), become customs discussion again, Bolsonaro advantage (we homophobic, racist want police guns keep shooting criminals without trials). creators Sputnik used Ad5 vector increases risk HIV infection. many different vectors available booster vaccination? **How domestic use COVID vaccine passports help?**

First off, I'm appreciate deadly virus governments around world struggling make decisions balance livelihoods lives. there's lot understand vaccine passports would help used domestically.

I travel quite bit always carry yellow-fever vaccination card alongside password, despite needed countries. think would reasonable require COVID vaccine booklet yellow fever vaccination traveling countries, particularly going high covid rate area low covid rate area.

It's domestic use passports find bizarre worrying. vast majority vaccine passport concepts I've seen date electronic, used anywhere airports restaurants hotels public place one may want go. one tracking paper yellow fever certificate. digital vaccine passport suddenly anyone access track everywhere scanned.

And what? understand things correctly vaccinated mean can't still spread covid makes less likely. staff vaccinated, cares people coming restaurant hotel are? (deliberately) unvaccinated care, unable get vaccinated due medical issues going always take extra care anyway considering could potentially catch vaccinated person.

In mind, downsides vaccine passports FAR outweigh potential upside, I'm hoping someone convince otherwise. guess experience US, Canada European countries. seem allow visa applications country citizenship country current legal residence. Plus achieving goals swiftly, exporting demand US population drops off, bad strategy.

It bad strategy. important vaccinated risk groups countries one country fully vaccinated. Otherwise still keep running risk new mutations. mutations somehow resistant current vaccines, hurting helping. What? never mentioned Brexit article EU official commenting UKs situation amid ongoing dispute exports expect comments about? think 5m az India 1m doses az got exported EU fill finish imported back UK beginning vaccination campaign.  uptake 60+ population high. Overall uptake US quite low, compared countries like UK, 90%+ uptake age groups offered vaccine. They've opened younger folks mainly demand older age groups certain amount time. I'd guess US going exporting vaccines demand age groups starts dwindle--which, honestly, imagine end May latest. makes sense. Give workers option. Better yet would bimonthly tests. 

Obvious far optimal considering aspects epidemic. still better forcing. Based [the current Japan track vaccinate population mid-2022 They'd cope better received 3 sessions' normal cost cash instead. would like EU block doses UK beg publicly 
and receive doses wrapped EU flags.

The UK hostile power trying harm EU gain domestic political advantages treated such. Another troubling tohught continuation pandemic worldwide slow vaccination many countries might lead rise mutations variants might escape immunity risk US (and countries fast vaccinating) again.

We together population world. Seeing instance ""America first"" best course action is, opinion, dangerous. could end well, maybe. could also disastrous. ITT: People understand vaccines work efficacy calculated. Australia single Covid-19 death 2021. Incredible. “partially” true. However, usually takes months notice exponential growths seeing now. theory actual spread China may started August, 2019 didn’t see exploding spread December, 2019.

Nevertheless, lot factors could happened current growth cases India. Virus could mutated, gatherings significantly increased people got isolation boredom. One thing know is, currently virus extremely contagious it’s rational limit spread limiting crowds. However, see country exact opposite. Hence concern. use comma decimals, 600,00 600 600.000 600000, way around guys said shelf life 6 months. Surely get shit together right? guess sell everything. Waiting 12 months Pfizer likely End 2022 far away, re-election chances neglected :/ Canada self-righteousness, name iconic duo. guess that's technically true, considering UK part europe. So, unless vaccines come outside UK EU... everything going Brexit guys forever? read this?! saw country exporting vaccines vaccinating people,

Tell see country, EU that. three vaccines available EU used exported.

Then again: Somewhere thread read US exported AstraZeneca Canada approved US. would country exporting vaccines (of kind) vaccinating people, right? true. April way late, since we're travel hub millions people passing airports we'd close borders probably December virus still confined China. April already huge community spread UK. gonna happen rate. recent ban AZ &lt;60 doubt rate going anywhere down. Ireland parents 70's scheduled.

But question I'd spin back is: composite risk look like someone young attending concert multiply lower bound IFR COVID-19 16-35 age bracket? (Same thing risk hospitalization, severe/long term outcome, etc.)

For matter, look like someone 70+ age bracket, would resulting risk compare background risk death actuaries attribute merely elderly anyway? way European country could kept covid zero own. Maybe EU strategy. I’ve getting emails plenty appts Cintas &amp; UC Clermont. used Kroger app book mine divert vaccines states population wanted response us ordering many vaccines, less - Canada provide excess vaccines countries free charge, vaccinated everyone here.

And fair, Canada really good. We're hard ourselves, high standards, we've passed Europe vaccines per 100, actual deaths staying low, one dose strategy probably going give us semblance herd immunity end month (or maybe bit after). We're track give ~40% adults first shot end month. I'm honestly going surprised case counts go much higher currently really hope AZ receive major fine over, behavior nothing short criminal. stock market huge businesses. sure ordinary citizens people actually need help economically.

We can't get people get flu shots. people going get sick boosters, think realistic people keep them. Even less govt keep footing bill.

These companies time. Figure dosage way minimize side effects. don't, think enough people keep them. Especially governor's coming saying require vaccination passports. mostly moot since many jurisdictions already saying vaccine passports however clear.

With QR code, contains everything CDC vax record (name, dob, vaccines) digital signature. 

The government’s involvement consists maintaining root CA (certificate authority) signatures.

The health agency issues signs QR code using certificate longer involved. Anyone verify signature, long certificates valid (just like web connection bank secured)

Unfortunately name included, using friends QR code’s may work! Ja think!? stay highly vaccinated likely end game answer lies cell. Antibodies aren’t source immunity. real tragedy rich country’s 90 percent vaccine. Poor nations going left behind. understand Gaetz like hang Greenberg Bahamas lot. could grant that, metric used, that's obviously metric guiding decisions. somewhere next weeks US dips Canada terms infections/hospitalizations, they're going suddenly start exporting vaccines Canada. reason US shipping vaccines Brazil currently, even though could argue Brazil needs more.

It's argument currently (partially) true US coming peak, US balance export ratio based infection/hospitalization metrics.

If US complex system balanced vaccine exports based local metrics like infections/hospitalizations, describe nationalist policy, would highly technocratic one, US policy. US policy max vaccination US first, export remainder.

Healthy 20 year old Americans going get vaccine sickly 70 year old Vietnamese people. That's currently policy. would you? start commenting ""Biden 2024!"" ? extend way. discussion ok import (it is), percentage EU. get defensive? Hey Japan, get shit together. want come spend money you. Vaccines always solution whole mess. need continue ramp production vaccinate billions people. 

We also need monitor new variants fund development boosters become needed. 

But vaccines ultimate solution. Imagine listened people last February.
We'd lived nearly normal lives year now, like countries do. know, islands, magically alters transmission dynamics, totalitarian horrors like mandatory testing.

Whatever, bet everything upheld neutralization titers vaccines. Looks like adequate strategy trillion-dollar problem me, hedging pussies. Luckily, companies research institutes continue push knowledge capability alternative directions, might rescue dumb asses next lockdowns. great. get severe case vaccine? small amount, zero, think put medical debt, especially everything right. medicine needle? make sure safe. give time virus die area. Supply?

Denmark saving bit able second stress test Monday - 100.000 vaccinated day (population 5.8mill want compare). Seems like good idea test capacity really needed. Problem always lack available vaccines, never able get arms (in contrast media German redditors always incorrectly talk about). enough supplies could done first month

Luckily expecting get vaccines month alone got months combined going increase next months, nothing unusual happens main suppliers (mainly BNT) expect done first shot early mid summer That's really rousing song. Yes, would taking vaccine going someone else. Italy here... 1/6 population got first shot: it'd seem nice statistic isn't... lot ""journalists"" clickbaiters saying AstraZeneca vaccine same, bullshit reasons (even father, SURGEON, trust vaccine).

It's pathetic: 2021 guys, every medical organization said perfectly safe people still understand shit. Great news Vegas -- hopefully every casino follows lead. point allocating vaccine doses proportionate adult population given state, rather proportionate vaccine demand state. think that's case. would guess people see Canadians allies, culture, etc. cares puts herd immunity risk? already knew gonna tough obtain vaccination anyway. highly state dependent. Remember saw subreddit people countries laughing US handling Covid sooo much worse everyone else? angry wont share. Wont work limited vaccine supplies got Josh's shot yesterday woke noe fever feeling like flu. sucks I'll embrace 😭 task force charge of, driving 53 factories (European) continent. 53 factories women men (...) work together 24/7 5 teams allow us reach immunity refered July 14 also allow vaccinate neighbours. Brits instance, depend almost entirely us, EU neighboors, depending EU entirely work factory. important us. 60% doses produced within Union (...), 40% doses produced neighboors. one that.. communist country small island country. fair goal post. stuff get bulk cook. think that’s bad, imagine food harvested first place. Someone usually touch it. improvement January 60%. It'll slow process, enough societal pressure antivaxxers keep coming around. Well, get immunized hard way. end really matter immunity comes from. herd immunity risk..
 
75% immunity vaccine rest immunity natural infection full herd immunity achieved.. Yes, gotten sick would end ""quarantine"" period. interpretation mess. chances child dying covid 1 500,000 Ya know, hearing last 20+ years US “mind business” interfere sovereign nation’s domestic policy; sure feels like sudden we’re bad guys exactly that. 

We’ve clearly seen benefits/results social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands, etc; know absent vaccine best method controlling spread disease tandem occasional additional restrictions successful curtailing explosive exponential spread virus. 

If home burning it’s either government isn’t actively participating curtailing spread temporary restrictions citizenry grown apathetic adhering established guidelines. don’t understand way fault responsibility US. don’t think it’s us ahead vaccines. It’s we’ve lockdown since late December. Whole Foods seems different. kept ones pull lever bag nothing scoop stuff bag. We'll reach herd immunity one way another. question many corpses cost us? Try site... aggregates major pharmacy chains open appointments. cover ones state/local govt though. CI around protection death vaccines either P3 trials observational study? job actually paying us bonus get it, friends same. Hopefully help get people simply complacent get vaccinated. need rest world? concern rush protocols. takes years even start clinical trials humans let alone start public. coworkers conversation. 20ish employees least 7 days second Pfizer dose call outs issues besides sore arms. Fortunately overstaffed anyways prioritize folks getting vaccine 

The owner lives another county got first shot moderna week fevers, chills, intense headache. Yeah based US “current numbers” early January 21, would similar timetable. 

The pace improve rapidly. here. Finally. 1. right. ""feels"" different that's choice ;-).
2. track record governments general things like less optimal. I'm happy implementation covid exposure apps, though. Assuming QR code contain personally identifying information maybe intrusive, seems would open abuse, could show image someone else's vaccine QR code screen. end implementation would personally identifying information. risk significantly reduced eliminated. still die covid serious symptoms vaccinated.

This undersells vaccines IMO fear would send wrong message. efficacy hospitalization/death basically come rounding error away 100%? risk severe outcome already substantially lower younger demographic that's likely attending concerts (in OP's example); vaccination would render ""lightning strikes twice"" levels.

I'm really averse seeing us make decisions based ""*technically* there's still risk"" start getting .00X% threshold ""see, risk zero"".

Otherwise, protection mild/moderate symptoms see several percentage points' difference 100% vaccines fall little variants. That's fine; risk catching mild moderate cold large gathering existed since dawn time, since dawn time personal decision whether change risk. There's need change system.

I think logic passports temporary measure cruises, concerts, plays spread dies fine, I'd worry execution. Scope creep, I've said elsewhere discussions, devil, necessarily paranoid want get front it.  Scientists talk ... ignored. Looks like US heading another surge, lost count. drag ass general, got mine Tuesday opened 16+ several people line appeared old enough get vaccine months ago. agree. vaccines US won’t use, give neighbors. followers (we call bolsominions) thinks doesnt care people says say offensive things confidence must right. whole ""he says is, like paid media"" whatever NC trying distribute vaccines fairly let’s face it, need send cities less rural areas. case, UK start setting domestic supply chains Q2/3 2021? knew case back May really cannot believe article written days ago. Januray may made sense. touch reality. downvote, good point. Working form office full-time really great. I'd also love get vaccinated, really feel like returning office - day two week. mean exact reason mentioned it’s hard help countries exactly won’t face consequences it. We’re democracy, answer citizens. Europe made democracies. Russia China aren’t democracies. 

Will Europe allies take vaccines Russia China? course, wouldn’t they. vaccines mean they’ll actually trust Russia China? Absolutely not. 

While I’m sure US’s level trust weakened right now, Russia China aren’t making major gains make one nice gesture. China committing genocide *right now.* Donating vaccines might buy time delay punishment that, doesn’t buy equal partnership Europe. long governments declare ""over."" headline actually ""***May*** Put Herd Immunity Risk"". Way put alarmist twist it. Vaccine hesitancy much bigger problem EU elsewhere. problem sort out. Ehh yeah really. We’re better vast majority world time everyone else vaccines Australia within months minimal negative economic effect compared huge positives we’ve keeping virus control Scientists trial volunteers worked butts last year keep us safe. don’t take vaccine don’t want least respectful amazing multinational effort end pandemic. Trump put family members charge distribution. 

Biden put qualified experts. 

Of COURSE Trump would fucked up. fucks everything up. Everything touches turns shit dies. Suite then. Fuckin die. close call back last January due parents getting really, really sick (and avoided it) november mysteriously got sick tested negative. know fortunate many people werent bad. 

I'll correct it. hope works Canada thing. LOL sure delusional, huh? US banned exports. We’ve exported several countries purchase contracts vaccine. It’s many countries signed contracts way back when. didn’t want take risk unknown vaccine. entire comment mess. Give Trump credit. promised 20 million doses end 2020 almost came within 16 million doses goal! really europe rest world. yes you. don‘t try tell anyone great you‘re. plain call is: blatant nationalism. It‘s fine, don‘t try convince people otherwise. 

And please it‘s much paid vaccines, thats even reason us production high is. Pfizer never used money warp speed providing vaccines. Biontech Pfizer got money europe usa what? Expecting BC shutdown soon. Following Ontario footsteps. said ""people seriousness discussing Santa Claus logistics distributing gifts flying reindeer"".  talking context?

It scientific logic. debated philosophical question, practice real acquiring knowledge works, scientific otherwise. think negative descriptive word here, absence presence something. decide god existed, reasonable, prove absence prove presence? 

It really easy prove presence, could perform cool tricks. prove absence impossible believers going say built way show measuring instrument make anyway, today future. really easy imagine supernatural entity know never disproven.

Of course joke. point. thousands different religions throughout history, prehistory, made claims existence supernatural beings. claimed beliefs happened right one. none reasonable others. point might well joke, make difference joke not. 

There reasons believe religious teachings. reason someone believe taught beliefs people. example christian god truly existed, somehow showed aztecs Mexico. children raised believe many gods, example Yacatecuhtli, god merchants.

It unsolved problem. copy-paste, say ""see wrote guy"", leave that, ignore one you? Generally 6:00 a.m. Central time zone (at least March). Israel's R(t) would indicate lower R0 Covid. Also using Wuhan Diamond Princess data would come highest possible R0 rate practically zero natural immunity targeted protocols. Calculating herd immunity needed USA 2021 using data would unrealistically high. Without significant surface transmission would imagine could challenging COVID R(t) 1 assuming whatever natural immunity 50% population vaccinated. It’s really wild reading good news Covid, I’m Texas can’t even pick food without anti-maskers putting danger I’ll take Deus ex machina type deliverance waking hell

But real, “countries rich” like Bezos beating death drums keep slaves working pandemic blood hands. 

Then Texas better California Florida better Michigan, like hell knows “right” approach Covid was, know I’m sick thinking largest lose civilian life countries history occurring could sit couch wait Also government excused companies liabilities. seeing mesothelioma type lawsuits 10 years. Got it. Check Rite Aid site, that's got ours. picked smallest town OH store issues. meant Austria Germany

Oh dear lol 4/5: 4.9M

J&amp;J 4/12: 0.8M

Based states said, 4/19 allocation supposed even lower.  That's crazy. Changing opinion matter 3 months additional research results. calls scientist. hospitals suffer massive losses fewer patients, major COVID-19 AHA estimates net financial impact COVID-19 hospitalizations four-month period $36.6 billion. words, nation’s hospitals health systems collectively lose $36.6 billion, including payments COVID-19 patients, March June 2020 treating COVID-19 patients alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Hospitals want COVID. big moneymaker taking account costs. 

“vaccine hesitancy: 
• Refers delay acceptance refusal vaccines despite availability vaccine services.
• complex context specific varying crosstime,place vaccines.
• influenced factors complacency,convenience confidence.” Sorry, meant safe zone thomboembolic events. Already got J&amp;J, month ago. 

Very well explained though. There's much black/white thinking Reddit. Everything like getting hit truck. know vaccines currently going Americans going pumped around globe we're done right? bought 7 Xboxes 4 surface Tablets also changing internet browser Edge search engine Bing second dose. Bill Gates strikes again! ELI5: israel achieved vaccine goal fast? buy/invest vaccine advance? convince anti-vaxxers/ traditional folks ( US EURO )  bizarre social pressure virtue shaming easily weirdest thing pandemic. I’m sorry, get yourselves. one gives fuck think reason got 400k day. given almost quickly receive them. sense fine. said comment, think maybe arguing 2 different scenarios. thought scenario adults vaccinated, say let kids run around play see reason vaccinate adults life vaccinated. argument probably also shelved simply vaccines approved yet children that's main hesitation. children vaccines date they're definitely getting covid vaccine yet. 25% FUCK Germany it’s 12th April I'm anti-vaxx I'm going wait get inoculated Ok? exports then? much talking about?

Are sure canada could add canadians first clause contract us firms? Around 70 percent people said kind injection site reaction, like pain swelling, half generalized reaction like fatigue chills. 

I'm shook! better Quebec. Every provinces fucking shitshows. True, full approval almost here. good point, become moot anyway. I've given visiting regional subs long time. There's probably good deal selection bias going on, staunchest die-hard advocates staying inside time ones actually so, taking Reddit perspective. It’s 8% respondents.

Well, not, 8% **their** respondents.

It's 8% statistically sound survey 80,000 US residents conducted U.S. Census Bureau developed concert Centers Disease Control Prevention National Center Health Statistics. Headline right now: [US sees chilling signs fresh Covid surge, Worldometers look 7 day moving average daily new cases daily new deaths. case metric perhaps plateaued, death metric continues steep decline. Drill individual states. Michigan state really seeing anything like surge. PA NJ seen modest upticks (in cases deaths). states flat declining metrics. ...and yet ""We need everyone vaccinated end pandemic!""


""What? No, course get go back normal! you, crazy?"" Officially Moderna 4 weeks doses. Pfizer 3.

There's good chance Moderna would work 3, dosing tested approved. remember correctly canada bought vaccines us without knowing never made public. clauses blacked reason. Canada never received anything got essentially told buy somewhere else. Except fact US manufacturers exporting countries—the countries also risked signing contracts well clear vaccines would work. EU signed similar contract months ago, required deliver-by date contracts sign Astra Zeneca, situation would different. “US ban” prevented countries signing similar contracts months ago. chose take risk, are. situation quite different ban. US took major risk signing purchase agreements vaccine approved, getting benefit bargain. rate, USA reach Herd immunity (80% general public fully immunized) August. slower vaccination program vaccinates, people left exposed COVID, larger epidemic grows (see: Europe). best estimate currently covid. 20 deaths per one million cases covid 0-17 year olds. flu 2017/2018. 

115 deaths 3,678,342 cases 31 deaths per million cases 0-4 year olds. 

528 deaths 7,512,601 cased 70 deaths per million cased fo 5-17 year olds.  ""Within work setting, vaccination coverage highest among HCP ambulatory care hospital settings vaccination requirements (96.1% 95.7%, respectively), lowest ambulatory long-term care settings without vaccination requirements, promotion, on-site offer (47.7% 49.9%, respectively)."" hate us anus I’m American work pharma assure you’re wrong CDC/FDA still saying might 80% two weeks 1 shot 95% full vaccination. odd tested two shots months change procedure one study Israel (who might different variants) saying might effective thought. J&amp;J vaccine one shot that's original testing it. They're still process studying two shots may end changing itself.

But even 2% effective that's still big deal talking hundreds millions people. places shots short supply might make sense start giving saved second doses first doses (especially safe wait 6 weeks shots instead 3-4). yet :/ haven’t able find appointment original comment tongue cheek, mine. know. Let’s math: I’ve got 1 vaccine shot, many have? Ask guests send copy along RSVP. funny coming back thread next day different mindset rereading it. 😇 initial response statement ""why"" well. took everyone room vaccinated except kids that's probably meant. kids also daycare sick 8 times year (including Covid) mileage definitely vary compared others different situations. 

I personally see major risk moment there's many unknowns virus well vaccine. long truly feel best kids complain. said blame federal government?

In States it’s two parties charge CxU SPD. It’s two it’s greens die Linke. 

They screwing one way another. would rather upfront institute export ban fact stop shipments destined countries. Telling countries look elsewhere vaccines different telling count x number factories keeping yourself.  Employers totally hook testing employees jobsites every kind still hotbeds community spread, coronavirus respiratory diseases. imagine employers mandated weekly test battery communicable illnesses (flu, corona, RSV, norovirus, etc) well offer two+ weeks sick leave, would realize immense healthcare cost savings would justify minor expense (especially compared insurance premiums). Here’s one you: world thinks people
Like spreading misinformation Wait, need leave groceries outside two days wipe every individual package disinfectant bring inside?

Remember actual advice given out? Hell, pretty sure last week subreddit asking wallpaper would okay sprayed disinfectant it. Rural/burbs. classrooms access outdoors all. older portion school windows theoretically opened, newer wings went glass doors outside non openable panes glass allow light. fully vacciniated since 2/24/21 last weekend went NHL game weekend going movie, feels great. wish messaging media government ""look fully vaccinated worry"" rather SAFE KNOW NEW SURGES. Yeah, new surges among people without vaccine yet. frustrating. We're well past time vaccine safety measured.

Virtually negative side effects vaccines manifest within 6 weeks administration. vaccines unsafe, we'd known now.

This fact spread far wide. Hillbillies cursing China iPhones. funny, prefer jnj cause convenient, got moderna might think could stop 100 people street approximately 25 refuse vaccine, works. People refuse vaccine typically live subculture also refuses it. Whether hyper conservative ""young invinsible"", group mentality.

The odds areas 1 4, odds fact-accepting areas less 1 4. might herd immunity reached areas others. Well never told people that, yes selectively remembering. Hang friend. pass soon. feel CONSIDERABLY better forcing bed eat, drink &amp; take 2 Tylenol. Back bed &amp; hoping actually sleep point. mean don’t get wrong, trump lot harm helped, pandemic otherwise.


All saying leap faith people administration commited advanced payments amounting 6 billion dollars back March 2020.

As result American government worry securing vaccine doses all.


Let’s honest here, someone like Bush/Obama/Clinton came project warp speed, would undoubtedly praised would probably become part legacy. Michigan filled open slots. generally don’t understand people problem. 

I think many people strangely relying government, signing waiting lists instead booking private sector. Portugal thing without vaccines, mean vaccines working instead lockdown related. **squints harder loss human capital drag economy decades** 

Nope, still wrong, fucked Covid response last 12 months strong Dr.? Nice try, American public vaccinated domestically produced vaccines, imported vaccines. Except way africans, middle eastern central asian immigrants.
""Homogenous sweden"" myth. powered form

It exported though. form mean mass-vaccinations due expensive produce, purpose used remote regions logistics regular form would pose significant difficulties. Agreed. idiots drifting crazy world best can. Thanks kind words, good luck guys well! Hey, that’s true; became spokesman Covid hoaxer movement still inspires people day selfish assholes endanger communities, themselves, loved ones sheer propaganda, stupidity, misinformation

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus). Please include link submission.* adult US, probably getting Moderna. two weeks first shot 80% protected, second shot timed least 3 weeks first, close 95% protected.

However, protection defense resistance. Defense would someone shot arrow dodge arrow. get hit damage. Resistance arrow hits fraction damage normally would.

So percents, vary person person different, we're also different different days, etc. percents hard fast anyway.

And, hey, could get hit truck. true safe zone. nearly everywhere nearly times safe zones. I'd still suggest making strangers bus stop. mean, would argue absolutely Americans obtuse children much are. Let's honest, we're obtuse children dealing crazy world.

And sure, point, trying contextualize Canadians feeling butthurt, trying justify actions (which think absolutely actions spoiled children). 

Anyway, good luck everything, happy see vaccination rates USA way are, I'm really hoping get hump ASAP (and economy tied yours, lol). It’s „corrected right now“. always enough orders.

If EU ordering another 300 million doses BioNTech January 2021 fits description mind: Fine, that's that's way much need way many doses way late.  wonder deliver Europe well. Thought talking death, matters.

Sick fenceposts move. article literally hospitalizations. ""deaths matter,"" read headline (which obviously posting) go ""Meh, what? They're dying.""

So what's big problem? Hospitilizations matter (according you), yet big fear mongering headline.

You've got problem news, yet primary way digesting news aggregator site headline reading. That's mate. News agencies enough content opening up, see busy complaining reddit fearmongering headlines.

""Young adult"" contextual term. 22 year old walks library. know directed? ""Young adult"" section. That's filled books middle schoolers high schoolers.

So context rising COVID hospitalizations, makes perfect sense split group people get elgible vaccine recently. Sure, makes actually click link, heaven forbid someone actually read something understand read spamming comment reply button. “Like miracle go away April”

To fair, didn’t say April Oh! Haha. Apologies, wasn’t speaking that, speaking fact many us southerners *do* believe science. CDC estimated [83.1 million infected Covid beginning year. number today close 120 million, around 35% entire population.

We know 1 5 (20%) Americans fully vaccinated, **27.2%** immunity vaccines.

If multiply 27.7% (received vaccine) 120 million (natural infection) get 33.2 milliion - number people infected received vaccine. So, leaves around 86.8 million **(26.3%)** immunity infection yet receive vaccine.

**So, estimate number people immunity Covid around 50%, possibly little bit higher.** American adults say absolutely never get vaccine. 

People say things like they'll ""never get married"" ""never kids"" ""never move city"" change mind. people contrarians early polls taken knew eligible months. Also vaccine passports become thing people get vaccine get left out.

I concerned even number truly 25% number probably lower urban areas (where spread likely) 10% population likely virus anyways still contribute herd immunity. Get many adults vaccinated, get children vaccinated deemed safe, it'll sort out. Yep, got appointment day site Lawrenceburg, worked Yes. numbers low scare much either. 1 10000 aged 25 get blood cloth every year, increases age. 
They course need keep checking, current numbers might well coincidence. interconnectedness Western Europe greater even North East Asia let alone Oceania.

Even ‘success’ stories like Germany nearly 3 million cases 80K deaths. fair say UK could done better, way going match likes New Zealand. May sooner, we're expecting first J&amp;J doses Poland April 14th iirc.

Still, EU April J&amp;J deliver doses overall. say bulk quota Q2 delivered May&amp;June - let's hope true delays happen. Don’t forget hordes anti-vaxxer’s directly quote reason ignore pandemic/claim it’s hoax day might prevent us reaching 80% Heres link Thanks! Also worth noting people largely self-selecting vaccination, people probably also self-selected mitigation strategies like social distancing, mask wearing, avoiding gatherings. people done spreading virus likely ones vaccinated point.

In addition, people vaccinated ones previously avoiding social spaces engaging them, vaccines 100% effective, may still get sick possibly even spread it, though unlikely they'll get sick need hospitalization. two 32 ounce insulated water bottles go everyday I’m typically pretty hydrated, notice little dried out. didn’t need drink normal, noticed thirstier normal would drink. 

No issues sore arm. also took amino acid supplements figure maybe helped little? Also taking vitamin supplements daily basis. put sick time work get second shot since might gnarly one. see large pharmaceutical companies would want make something would hurt child. infant gets vaccinated know finally safe away dangerous virus. Amazing happens Republicans gone.  doses same. That's funny part. We’re it! Look, there's reason previous comment deleted mods. I'll leave that. Export restrictions too! Hopefully studies younger kids hot heels one. still able hammer getting back normal looks like keeping kids safe, it'd nice put balancing act half-informed medical discussions past. I’ll never forget either. could tell set made mad didn’t even realize actual question super softball. Truly hall fame level dumbass. Vaccine export restrictions work! Mine June 14th. Congratulations wedding, 50 people, already vaccinated. really fair comparison, death rate yellow fever 3.5-7%. would much willing take kind risk circumstances. Light goddamn fire efforts get kids vaccinated! 


Go on? got second shot Moderna today! Feeling normal far. Texas cases aren’t climbing went mostly back normal month ago almost. also got moderna, arm sore days slept REALLY well night lol (mild fatigue). Still didn’t get second dose yet. seems black population lagging, compared white population terms percent population vaccinated. tend vote gop. However rural nature state factors likely Risk: On-site dining indoor seating. Seating capacity reduced tables spaced least 6 feet apart. think friends family [Tuskegee syphilis victims agonized definitions ""skepticism"" ""cynicism""? 

How studied incident? others like it? 

Is room COVID-related discourse worldview besides full-throated government support uneducated/mentally ill rejection government guidance? Though, correctly describe, pre-infected least incentive get vaccinated anyone, still significant advantages even them.

* know (to reasonable certainty) going infect someone normal activities (as become allowed again) cost life. direct benefit you, many people would feel terribly guilty happened.
* travel internationally without hassle repeated testing.
* save unknown number COVID infections rest life, non-zero chance causing serious deadly complications.   got easily time mean easier next time, especially next time happen undergoing separate health crisis hospital. Sameeeeee read all? lol need get kids now. would say school one bigger spreaders. avoid another masked school year, needs get done summer.  Sore arm two days 2nd dose done! Whole immediate family fully vaxed. also said day also developing things, know things would self defeating. other's largest trading partner, American citizens live Canada foreign country border towns definitely need crossing traffic (See: Point Roberts, Washington) Hahahah guy. Cope. literally means nothing comparing island nation spread covid 😂 Getting first shot hours! psyched finally qualify. correlation right now, hard determine causation.

There roughly 35,000,000 people administered NA/EU/UK 18 instance blood clot know of.

Even cause 1:2,000,000 chance quite low. two points reference, death lightening strike US 1:2,320,000 deaths per Vehicle miles driven US 1.1 deaths per 100 million miles driven, means drive roughly 55miles chance dying(obviously factors like time, speed, location change statistical average). plz share vaccines? :D sure means, thanks. people covid Michigan state. see someone MI someone TX right would pick TX. probably wouldn’t want see though. EU made yes mean UK made virtually none. UK produced enough suit needs author article misreading study. didn’t find ten percent children COVID hospitalized. sample study children teens received treatment hospital emergency department. Ten percent sample admitted inpatient hospital. it’s ten percent kids admitted hospital, it’s ten percent kids seen ER COVID sick enough required admission hospital literally hundreds articles. search USA blocks vaccine ip rights. kids spreaders, lead new variants. definitely harder keep mask low risk areas shots :/ even like two weeks first shot, outdoor compliance going negative direction. First dose? arm felt somewhat stiff day so, bit flu shot. hear worse COVID before, second dose hear that's worse too. No, moght enough jobs working home provide everyone afraid covid vaccine perform them. Billiond people made year without getting it. It’s odd! dad says put waitlist Walmart, doubt knows exactly search. search today CVS area everything booked. I’m sure comes dad really knowing get vaccinated. 

The Target work Oklahoma taking walk-in vaccinations! really, means fairly small number children get sick enough hospitalized tend really sick. terribly surprising since probably conditions like adult might, they're COVID really bad. Cool, interesting, appreciate it, yeah, gets actual hesitancy. 

And yeah, it’s I’m trying discount data trends particular populations, it’s ongoing challenge best communicate specific information vs data related specific question, careful over-extrapolate/generalize. 

It’s tricky stuff! right. supply issue anymore. vaccines willing participants places. said I'm Democrat? I'm American. vote whoever best politician period. happens past 10 years I've gone mostly blue used quite great Republicans too.

However, quite easy feel embarassed. energy policies still stuck 1870's-1940's much westernized world made massive shifts alternative energy. 

Our infrastructure, pride world decaying. Many Americans still drink lead pipes. Much rural America still broadband. ability built massive solar farm desert transfer energy hundred miles. takes nearly 12 hours take train New York City Pittsburgh takes half time drive date rail is. 

Wealth inequality America MUCH worse almost anywhere else earth. wealth gap bad countries like Rwanda. I'm supposed feel proud that?

We also still one countries offers little maternity leave majority working women country. let's get started gender pay gap well.

We country whose federal minimum wage still $7.25 

So asking proud this? Gotcha.

This Austin TX weren’t even hit hard parts Texas. Yes, holiday weekend. think coincidence 7 day moving average going consistently right until.. Good Friday Easter Weekend suddenly dipped? dip evident bigger holidays (e.g. Thanksgiving Easter), dip seen every holiday weekend. 

On non-official trackers (e.g. OurWorldInData, Worldometers), 7-day moving average almost certainly new local maximum today's data posts. really. anyone gets covid bad enough require hospitalization, disproportionately high risk requiring icu treatment. expected.

The majority get bad enough require going hospital first place. CureVac pioneers technology Drew Weissman Katalin Kariko University Pennsylvania, among others.

Initially, Pfizer fund 100 percent development costs, BioNTech repay Pfizer 50 percent share costs commercialization 'Couldn't care less France does, mind French though. Actually, I've found French absolutely fine speaking them. And, I'd say good luck Canada.

So, whichever way try spin it, fact remains obliged help Australia way we're European countries.

Nobody said vaccines prevent spread. said probably prevent spread least certain portion, yet enough data form clear consensus measuring effectively prevent spread, want people act like they're invincible zero chance spreading it. It’s conundrum, know I’m getting it, don’t know when. I, like everyone else, want least amount side effects it, think reasonable stance, especially someone it. would definitely want J@J. able choose j@j random hand? Anecdotally hospital system pediatric patients likely sent ICU precaution. would also mention 10 percent seems high, least Florida.

Definitely good bit explain. shortcuts like saying ""free reduction"" instead ""basically free reduction.""

But that's say, right? Ass me, right? could stayed way had, know, actually took seriously. Two weeks give great amount immunity. people actually think anyone wearing masks September? Yeah, BioNTech/Pfizer Comirnaty, nobody uses names. Germany everyone calls ""BioNTech vaccine"". “I going live fear virus 1% chance killing me! keep vaccine 1-several million chance blood clots fuck away me.”

s\ You’re downvoted it’s true. Biden admin pulls strings CDC announcement pure doom sensationalism. Quit posting shit. like third time I've seen copy paste it. nearly funny witty seem think. rollout happened federal level. 50 minu counties approach means solution implemented 50 times. “Pfizzy” - love lol think Netflix would interested striking deal go second dose today! fresh food someone needs wear hairnet gloves (or otherwise clean hands). nothing bird flying overhead though, birds poop flying. eat fresh food without washed. got first Moderna yesterday. symptoms sore deltoid. flu vaccine back October last year made entire arm sore 3 days, plus gave flu-like symptoms next day. far, first shot Moderna incredibly mild first 24 hours.

I can't wait second shot 4 weeks! tried everything else though, truly unstoppable force. vaccines great, ended getting Pfizer vs J&amp;J really liked amount good data they've released. mention real world data we're seeing Israel. think Biden vax team exploring possibility re-allocating vials regions pressure Spring Surge. controversial since many counties hit Red flagrantly avoided vaccination masking protocols. I’m state 6M people. average, 60k deaths occur state every year. Covid deaths total 6,600.

Over 20% deaths NINETY. Add 80+ group talking 50+% covid deaths. 

Average age death USA? 78. 

Now add 70+ group it’s 80% deaths. Let sink in. There’s reason virtue shamed 20 year old. It’s fucking death second yesterday feels like someone took hammer shoulder head body-aches, overall nothing wild. trying all, posting Washington Post articles.

Oh FYI worked Bernie Sanders campaign Trump fan.

Work time :) Yeah it’s weird get downvoted stating statistical fact. I’m super optimistic summer US, I’m fully vaccinated working hard get people NC vaccinated. Fortunately it’s getting harder find people haven’t already shot(s) made arrangements, meaning people signing far tell.  Fauci would speak last Spring: ""thank lord least one adult room trying take seriously"" 


[Me Fauci talks now](http://gph.is/19yOHAr) People close together cause viruses spread

When people apart, can’t spread

That’s causality Pfizer get assistance German government though?  Sign every pharmacy (as far you’re willing drive) local health department. Except can’t insert blacks. NPR reported vaccine hesitancy lower among blacks among whites. Conservative men definitely lead pack. Unfortunately become politicized, there’s need try obscure fact. slowly converting while. people protesting sort restrictions seized opportunity make voices heard, entire year later. They'll probably death beds telling grandkids brave standing big bad government 'rona. mean I’m case start seeing results now, still 1.5 2 million daily vaccinations good half vaccinations second shots. hope I’m right you’re wrong! fact trump get second term speaks power system.

Yep, i'm fine plateauing 3 million day. end May rate every adult wants vaccine able get least one dose. 

Summer come. Yesterday said 1 4 vaccinated. depends live. Iowa grocery store best prices full service: bag groceries, put car you. Aldi cheaper chain sometimes shop there, stores states bag groceries price. Behind paywall. Couldn’t read it. Yeah, Ill add speculation. Age, PPE AND..... environment quality ventilation many cases overhead antimicrobial I'm skeptical 70% people going get vaccine, based anecdotal sampling people know live Yes of-course. enough supply like US. got approx. 19 million doses Q1! Supply would increase April onwards. supposed receive atleast 3.5-4 million doses weekly month. vaccination ramped accordingly. Today gave 720k jabs, highest far. still less that's supply unfortunately. Damn, mine says Etch-A-Sketch side.

I also white it. Yup, 96 million people! poor living paycheck paycheck, seasonal farming day wages. citizenry government joined handle sh!t comes Covid.  tell agreed get go Covid enemy. wasn’t hard sell SARS 1. 

It’s quite impressive look it. Quarantine travelers, aggressive contact tracing, clear concise communication basic realities concerning Covid, important factor populace that’s bought concept unmitigated spread Covid bad thing everyone. 

They go one fascinating society grapple dust settles. right think aren’t paying attention remarkable handled it. truth health system super great we're actually rich country.

How explain unprecedented number patients? NZ economy crumble 0 tourism right now. 

Add fact stay shut due low vaccination numbers see Greece 2.0 Same. Second shot buddies? Michigan resident, ""almost certainly come"". would actually bet money additional restrictions put place. relying vaccines stomp fire. three weeks get second Moderna. excited! day after, course. Michigan filled open slots.

my experience everywhere slots, although eligibility may vary. problem necessarily easy get shot. might try 10 websites, check hours. repeatedly check.

I hear people complain ability get vaccine internet IRL, without fail trying one site, tried gave up, expect someone call them. Unfortunately easy right get shot, takes work. work, find one hours (if that). Except California said “common sense” mask mandate continue. 🙄 no, got flat screen monitor 40 inches wide. also worth pointing US initially vaccine distribution bottlenecks December/January due part complicated inflexible eligibility prioritization requirements. 

The requirements designed fair possible prioritize groups needed vaccine most. sufficient number vaccines became available, priority regulations became bottleneck: everyone class 1(b)(2) show up, would extra vaccines given next lower priority class...so tended either go waste given whoever showed end day looking unused shots. 

Eventually, rules relaxed make easier bump eligibility lower priority tiers ensure better match vaccines people wanting vaccinated. Texas warmer everyone outside could help don’t think so. really didn’t anything get there. technology already existed mRNA vaccines, Pfizer first approved. They’re German company. fired Rick Bright halfway pandemic (the nations leading expert vaccines, logistics, supply chain).

You evidence except timing. Can’t stay home Reddit forever 🤷‍♂️ Yes, 43% first vaccinations April 7 county. puts us bit mid May close half county vaccinated, I’m hoping cases really start tI plummet. close things, plus higher vax numbers could save lot lives. live MN wife complaining weeks. need 2am ready type info lightning speed get appointment anywhere remotely close Twin Cities metro. willing/able drive 1+ hours metro, appointments get within next 24-48 hours. today even. want vaccine, fine, diverting doses areas want it. US averaging 60,000 new cases 1,000 deaths per day last week.

Canada averaging ~5,000 new cases 30 deaths per day time period.

Even US decides take care countries priority themselves, Canada nearly heavily hit countries. India's 7 day averages ~100,000 cases ~600 deaths. Brazil ~60,000 cases ~4,000 deaths per day.

I can't find path conclusion US place countries suffering less COVID-19 itself, did, Canada would high list. I'm thinking countries excelled--Vietnam, South Korea, Cuba. Europe. Planting seeds seemed like prudent thing facing possibility supply chain interruptions. God forbid people try self sufficient. anyone thinks cases going drop zero?

I think definitely people still believe % risk much. misinformation spreading two weeks ago vaccines effective preventing transmission really nasty impact subset people think going very, difficult get come around reality. Similar way misinformation mask effectiveness last year exacerbated anti-mask sentiments (when experts went told public masks actually work well could manipulate people panic-buying supplies needed healthcare workers). believe vaccine transmission rate misinformation likely similar motives, effort keep unvaccinated people using growing vaccination numbers justification expand bubbles.

I think people generally going positions power though. Society fully reopen whether reopening compatible personal risk tolerance. people enough going lives benefits reopening strongly outweigh tiny % risk left get 60-80% vax range.  interesting hypothesis, far tell science every verified it. Let know science done proper study. Thanks! need hear J&amp;J fine choice, believe developing thier booster shots too? personally think going deal breaker ultimately, wanted get opinions.

I think I'm going cancel Moderna, want sit extra appointments go use! Much like everything else days, red parts states blue parts - red parts always places people consistently wrong thing. convinced vaccines contain 5G chips Jesus take care get sick, course vaccination numbers lower.

I'm convinced best way get higher uptake red regions threaten take doses away send cities (especially 'inner cities') - can't get right reason, least get spite. amazing distinction think came actually makes point. 

In case HIV/AIDS, carrying virus, infect people exchange bodily fluids with. case Sars-CoV-2, depending ventilation, infect anybody room you.

So context limiting viral spread, people discriminating transmission Sars-Cov-2 HIV. serious?? read article? say think does. problem (speaking US only) 20% population isn’t eligible vaccine (kids 16) another 25% adults said won’t get vaccine. 

That means it’s still going fester give rise variants. variants survive virulent. may even evade vaccine target. 

I zero faith fellow citizens needs done. It’s hard enough getting people wear mask protect others.

I say that, we're better vaccine roll gamble Trumps part. turning well guarantee would pay we'd serious trouble. saw someone advocate carrot stick approach, rewards offered vaccination, certain length time, penalties lodged people refusing vaccine. thought good idea. completely true. plenty extra appointments sites conservative areas state (hundreds per day Yakima, Tri-Cities, Spokane, Wenatchee, etc.). fill eligibility information check care sites, even though April 15/16 official date general ""On Monday, spokeswoman Pfizer clarified company part Operation Warp Speed supplier potential coronavirus vaccine.""

My comment said - many different types contracts - IP, full development, supplier. think many people mean say “when over”

That's actually impressive, I'm getting second moderna shot two weeks, far side effects minor headache day got vaccinated Stop complaining already. back normal years.

The truth US/UK/EU though last 2-3 decades policy cratered economies. [The real unemployment rate US something like 26-40% dependecing [almost meaningful recovery jobs since financial US. similar parts EU. High real unemployment actually structural problem country huge informal sector, like say Kenya something, since western societies declining trajectory previously better position, made governance nearly impossible.

We're going fighting covid getting shots years come.  They're entitled opinion, even science completely disagrees. Canada approved AZ 55 due blood clots. US already ""lent"" Canada 3.5m doses AZ. Don’t get wrong, I’m saddened fact, personally believe it’s effective safe vaccine. looks like lot people don’t want anymore, authorities recommend certain age groups, thus effectively reducing demand.

In country 70k doses available right now, people waiting lists vaccines.

I hope get jab soon possible! Cheers! Technically yah, trying convey ignorant (dont know anything nothing else shown , ie: hollow types, without regular access media) uneducated point pretty much thing. yah, youre right. oh awesome! lot diseases don’t exist United States high vaccination rate.

If everybody decides make individual choices many make come back.

And diseases come back don’t affect people didn’t get vaccine also affect people vaccinated.

Vaccines 100%.

The way work help us achieve immunity herd.

If enough people get vaccinated it’ll still continue spread around hurt innocent people. Got first shot Pfizer week ago getting second shot 30th. Looking forward fully vaccinated! booster specific one variant. many variants like Brazil, Double Mutant variant India, UK, California, New York etc. hopefully offer protection point.

There’s lot diseases Third World exist America part.   

That’s good public health vaccinations.

There’s reason Americans often get numerous vaccinations shots going Third World.

Perhaps someday people need come here. I'd say get J&amp;J vaccine think it. think people fairly mild set side effects J&amp;J, since skated covid likely too. get flu shot every year, probably side effects J&amp;J covid vaccine massive fear flu never terrible flu. take think it, really big deal. Interesting. woke 3-4 hours earlier normal Moderna shots. Nah, really not. Pfizer since years *the* partner BioNtech. BioNtech basically startup. able phase 3 many people. Money wasn’t problem here. btw, Germany gave last spring lot money EU. research. buying vaccine.

Yes, EU overwhelmed suddenly take care health care members - actually task. first time. work perfectly right away.

But since month everything fine, vaccinations really high days now, example Germany. weeks behind UK, that's ok. finally really starting. many activitie Betriebartzte there? think often one services bunch companies. Untrue. Like, fuck. never, way, part EU contracts. See Got second yesterday. tired body aches me.

Despite study estimated people 75 79 -- targeted initial vaccination campaign -- **there would 80 percent infections without vaccine**. Yes indoctrinate still young naive I'll leave Come on, Pfizer much Moderna heavily helped OWS. need like Trump say good thing. course not! May probably soon.

Needless say, seems like lot schools may lagging behind. think it’s asymmetric. Canadians dunk Americans, Americans forget Canada exists. Trudeau hampered black face wearing, incompetent, instagram influencer.

I see gibberish relevant acquisition vacancies. Perhaps leave politics door paid vaccines close top current vaccination.

Please research bought scheduled deliveries occur. Canada bought every single vaccine enough cover population vaccine. vaccine manufacturers shifting delivery requirements implementated nation vaccines produced. 

Canada went wide uncertainty prospective vaccines. would sink even money still may improved position export restrictions production believe record echo chamber.

You're literally repeating political talking points broski. want to, Israel get new wave Covid 19 variant, everybody gonna shits pants. Specifically actually do? Details. operations Warp Speed help Pfizer Moderna?

It didn't. bullshit like everything Trump cult does. Wooosh It’s crazy here. state excess supply downstate folks Chicago scrambling. Folks driving four hours go empty clinics Peoria. reallocated better sooner real head scratcher. I’ll checking time time see status vaccine countries 16s family members categories. 

Won’t checking obsessively lock second dose though. Meanwhile Australia... know way people barely sick people even flu level sick. never ashamed Canadian. 

Oh come on. We're small country small economy despite slow start we've top 3 G20 vaccination rates past 3 weeks. quick nonpartisan CERB response kept food people's table roofs heads. third wave sucks came LTC residents vaccinated fortunately current deaths small fraction prior peak. said done per capita death rate less half States Europe. we're among largest per capita donors COVAX help rest world get vaccinated. 

I'm ashamed all. response perfect, no. grossly hyperbolic. winning losing, comparing strategies. vaccination strategy UK probably efficient western countries (besides Israel, that's different story).  vaccine isn’t even approved kids (younger ones, anyway), it’s even discussion point yet. approved, guess pediatricians favor it. can’t predict future, source yet, I’ll happily eat words turn wrong. expect masks social distancing required good portion next school year? becoming paranoid?

I aware Dr. Walensky, head CDC, [now expects schools US reopened August However, stated, ""I would say still practice mitigation strategies, still mask, still distance, try keep crowds minimum. really think get country vaccinated, get back healthier, normal evening baseball field.""

For perspective, school, pretty careful state, currently operating hybrid schedule rotating classes cohorts. announced tentative plans return full days May. Masks social distancing required. Everyone's got different levels risk tolerance, according CDC, ""the risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19"".

Children generally higher risk year. may reasonable distance remote learn one adults house extremely at-risk and/or unvaccinated... semblance normalcy would good thing case. Isolation come heavy cost some.

Source:  viral induced asthma. respond breathing treatments well? feels sad year ago world worked together lots ways (certainly ways, bunch them), months we’ve/they’ve retracted hives got selfish. Problem is, Tedeos said, moral failure makes real problems likely materialise. jist immediate death toll still ticking, things like increasing chance mutation new variant vaccines don’t handle. back square 1. It’s like snakes ladders. wife got second dose yesterday. got Pfizer slightly sore arm. wife, got moderna, body aches, chills, headache. related still interesting. 

My guess higher amount lipids moderna might cause Though I'm share love, im even American live America. credit American government securing vaccines. 

Canada boasted deals nothing. 

I'm sure Biden done good work cant imagine him. Credit trump adminstration too. Obligatory “got vaccine” post! Johnson Johnson, bit tired feverish, weirdly refreshing way. Get plane next Minnesota Vikings game. I've first Pfizer dose, due second weekend. almost symptoms first one, aside arm pain bad, bad. hurt lay it, excruciating. lasted day so. husband headache, arm pain first Pfizer dose.

Flu shots always make sick degree surprised little reaction first dose. I'm little worried react second, keep reminding better getting covid. Good workers always get work done excel better work life balance working home. Companies always middle management monitor performance matter work Yes; consumption excess calories. seeing more.... like used 100 people ICU 95 70 years old, 6 people 30s? wanted point subthread '2000 dead kids' is, fact, 10x higher actual number. nice day :) Italy end February vaxxed 6% 80+, countries doses done 20+%. choice, Italy decided vaccinate teachers, judges, lawyers, journalists, healthcare admin not. wake everyday feel rested all, plus hard time staying awake and/or productive.

Damn that's [Bloomberg vaccine want check progress regularly. Hotels required turn forms state information it. 10% ""which shot get??"" Yeah thinking that. may totally necessary, clean surfaces easy access sanitizer bad thing. many kids lost business license? agree completely! However damage done. Astrazeneca said months ago, they'd never produce vaccine cost again. Come July, internally declare pandemic raise prices. serious worries means poorer countries can't afford Pfizer, moderna, J&amp;J etc. get everyone vaccinated, COULD outbreaks across world due tourism, business travel etc, people vaccinated. COVAX really got step game next year two Lies. Trudeau hampered black face wearing, incompetent, instagram influencer. paid vaccines close top current vaccination.

Don't believe record echo chamber. get that, also think that’s silly reasoning boost capacity 100 year crisis.

I’m sure shortened medical training requirements WW2.

By end war, German pilots lucky get weeks training. Though that’s maybe best example, died droves. 

The point is, change rules crisis, government take liability federal level. I've read Brazilian Yeah, least viral infection. 200k, 110k given/used Palestinians. Lol. live CA first time i'm hearing *looooooooooooooove* federalism? Hnnngg! germs body fight good immune system. go crazy constant hand sanitizer going find succumb every bug come contact with. Brazil fifth largest country world, 5,500 cities big number. Losing business license isn’t enforcing? know good amount restaurants lost license “not following lockdown orders.”

Also people listened. Plenty people did. Fucking scared anything.

And yes, kids part trauma.

It’s ridiculous you’re grasping excuses much dead wrong one them. wash produce well pandemic, year finally good habit. 

We washed non-produce stuff twice early days. Well, ya better thank Trump. Ya know, operation warp speed LOL Oh, need doctor research speak facts now? I'm sorry, aware allowed anymore.

Anyway, death rate children lower 0.003% (the average 0-19 - thought pretty obvious risk hospitalisation severe illness low. wanna hear kids need vaccinated doctor? name Martin Kulldorff top head. Due vaccines new produced short time, can't completely sure associated risk is, kids basically risk first place see right option moment. one sent million vaccines Palestinians, 10k vaccines released 2 days. liability skill. easily give someone life threatening bacterial infection, hit nerve, epipen someone etc. probably career work pharmacists license companies liability insurance. Got second moderna today. Feelsgoodman Hear, hear mate. imagine parents worried long term health effects also putting kids strict diet exercise regimen....ya know....to prevent long term health effects.

Not TV Twitter tell urgently start worrying things. That's one author study said.  57% vaccinated, 8-9% officially recovered (probably another 3-4% recovered tested). closer 70%. First, people vaccinated much less likely spread covid per CDC numerous studies Israel. vaccine isn’t health. It’s health everyone community. Especially can’t vaccinated. 

Second, college aged people largest spreaders COVID age group since pandemic started. large percentage college students asymptotic mild symptoms don’t even know sick spreading it. extremely important age group spreads Covid vaccinated. 

Finally chance vaccines side effects won’t discovered years (or many months) now. That’s work. don’t side effects taking it, shortly after, won’t side effects pop road. aren’t body long enough cause complications well future. 

I highly advise research vaccines go around saying things obviously false. don’t know that’s established. Source? Trudeau hampered lack domestic production export bans. Vaccine orders US entirely no-go even development. Yeah things pretty much well proven well known, even Reddit, CDC recommends it. Whether cleaning surfaces (I think people knew way back July), beach safe, vaccine 94% effective stopping symptoms actually stopping virus itself. course nothing 100% certain, still claim victory championing idea wiping groceries claim waste time.  Glad hear least EU sending ~~decent~~ *better* rate. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (WHO Director General) said Jan: “I need blunt: world brink catastrophic moral failure – price failure paid lives livelihoods world’s poorest countries,” inspection, families family members held hostage Gaza terrorist organizations appealed supreme court passing vaccines long family members released.

It took little day case get thrown 2 days shipment get way. Hypothetically, yes would asshole. I'm asking question discussed BIO class professor answer said people know study performed. also we're strict allowed get jab currently limited vulnerable ages adverse medical histories. Additionally take 90% unvaccinated younger ages risk much think point, astrazenica would super happy entirely known Oxford vaccine, considering negative press. full set symptoms first shot - sore arm, 101-102.5 fever, headache, muscle aches. second shot gave reaction. better worse. still completely gone within 36 hours. Hospitalizations plateauing - going though. israel blocked millions vaccine shipments places russia gaza 

That's lie.

A transfer 10k vaccines held less two days. That's all. Meanwhile Israel vaccinated 110k Palestinians WB see geographical location multi national's subsidiary anything delivery schedule though. Shit bruh, live NYC work suburbs, entire time working person, covid, vaccine, ""done"" even fucking started August, dont give fuck year, kids. joke. None enforced nobody followed them. Whether have, point remains, kids never locked point. ridiculous. Sick hygiene theater think continue practicing good hygiene expecting places go to. 

Especially people never washed hands pandemic. Hopefully wearing masks (when you’re sick) also becomes acceptable. confirm. first dose pfizer yesterday experiencing mild pain deltoid. Apart able work usual etc. wanted use GSK risk Trump would block vaccine shipments US AZ choice. misread said. None fit bill

1.	Janssen wholly owned subsidiary J&amp;J American. 
2.	Curevac hadn’t even started clinical trials time Biontech deal inked. started phase 3 December. like said, it’s approved yet.
3.	Biontech got ability manufacture finished product. doses available today production since last July. 

So 1 doesn’t work. 2 3 clearly plans would provide leverage today. way EU could leverage today Biontech active ingredient never left EU first place. maybe Bayer could’ve produced it, maybe Sanofi, maybe could’ve thrown money Biontech expedite Marburg plant. don’t know best. know Pfizer deal reason you’re low vaccination rates today. 

You cooperate everyone else don’t ability self sufficient. find funny EU politicians point vaccine exports pretend like they’re rest world favor, fact, Europe ability stop exports continue vaccinating public without effectively starting war UK US. False, yes did. Forcefully closing business invoking curfews lockdown. lockdown also restricting gatherings home - Christmas, weren’t able 1 family home certain cities, Philadelphia. similar events well.

I guess never left basement. reports people get vaccine, lot lingering complications clear well. Hypothetically would asshole taking additional vaccines could used vaccinate someone currently unprotected. course entirely hypothetical though. Loads medical professionals say risk low children back school. know evaluate data. I'm someone owns web browser.

So I'm going follow consensus experts send kids back . Brit, know response covid really bad. Watching daily deaths plummet whilst European neighbours heartbreaking. We're averaging 40 deaths day, France Italy averaging around 400 deaths per day (please correct I'm wrong). There's winners here.... chances kid dying long term effects covid basically nil. There’s certain point kids sake gotta let live lives. world isn’t 100% safe that’s how’s always been. It’s better stunting social growth development 2 years.  knew woman lived 106. outlived children grandchildren. Ssshhhh told would lead deaths seems young people low-risk occupations. proof vaccines stop virus, lockdowns.  look, weighing method looks unreliable one compared Estonia Latvia. almost equal population densities, among centiles two sparse centiles population densities higher Latvia. 25% estonians allegedly live dots population density least high even 4x higher highest population density dot Latvia. geometric mean corresponding ratios Estonian Latvian centiles 3,0. 
Very suspicious. Hey, it’s lot better March 2020 questions. “How much food need stock on? Anyone trouble finding food?” “My work/school/concert/graduation got canceled! OMG!” 

Or later 2020 questions...”On we-are-fucked scale 1-10, 11 12? Also, thought COVID positive person, could gotten infected?” felt little woozy hours after. Woke next day headache feeling heavily fatigued. bit nausea slightly high temperature. Woke day feeling totally back normal. Yes. think cutoff age high many countries, mine included (60 Portugal), 50+ many people could vaccinated Yep. concern I've heard it. Hmm, honestly makes perfect sense. Thanks detailed response!

Do actually think US safe place come fall? I'm going college figured going lot international unvaccinated students mingling husband vaccinated resume 'normal' life kids are, too. bc kids get really sick too, esp variants.  potential long term implications getting COVID (decreased lung capacity, brain fog, etc), we'd rather risk it. still wear masks public reduce risk much possible. like lost year college.

Again, whine, try exaggerate. lose year college, chose delay it, chose online chose transfer school kids campus. inconvenient, ""lost"". Funny thsts exactly thought stupid Canucks blasting US early covid game. Sucks get taste medicine buddy? I’m sorry F Trump. refused acknowledge pandemic support precautions. “Ounce prevention worth pound cure.” frantically pound cure phase we’ve killed 500k people many dealing consequences sick. know sources trust. post berated, wanted help. doesn’t last six months that’s literally long studies going lasts LEAST six months part debating, closed roads open airport? Otherwise produced non statement. probably wiped seat chairs towel proceed wipe next desk over. chance COVID already? scuttlebutt I've heard first dose rougher one caught it, likely already antibodies present.

It's guarantee, know someone doses resulted sore arm, curious.

The data points really place this, seen much consistency all. didn’t suggest “banning kids school.” suggested go mostly normal activity, masks vaccines ASAP. teach elementary kids seem bothered masks! thanks info. check out. J&amp;J scheduled next week greatly concerned decision. Pfizer's vaccine seems good choice. main concern variants. wish booster already one make better decision. weird call cities unlikely. silver lining another pretty solid endorsement vaccines destroying transmission rate. Look US UK dwarfing Canada every turn graph, suddenly they're lower first time ever. 

The whole world getting absolutely pounded yet covid, worldwide 7 day average already rocketed back December even seem slowing down. countries best vaccination seem totally conspicuously escaping far. way that's really good news long-term perspective. There's good here's problem. lot good things get society place could legitimately flatten curves reduce spread LOT. bought time. 

Then anything time bought prevent future spread. institute contract tracing remotely acceptable level. set data pipeline really figure spread occurring. control incoming travel adequately enforce quarantine controls. figure effective masking messaging PPE distribution. things countries effectively controlled spread done.

We've done better US Europe deaths per capita right give us satisfied?!

And count chickens hatch here. Tons vulnerable populations unvaccinated B117 reaching distribution things gotten really bad countries. really make sense.

You want vaccinated get exposed virus first week since white blood cell count may low. Pfizer 25% people got (what turned be) approved vaccine clinical lymphocytopenia days 1-7: largest changes baseline laboratory values transient decreases lymphocyte counts, resolved within 1 week vaccination (Fig. S3) associated clinical Exactly, think times could've gotten laundry done waiting meeting start. better yet, imagine laundry longer do, dress work every day. Jeezus, thought r/noahgettheboat thought read something unpleasent. Anybody know what's going New Hampshire? middle pack jumped top April 1st. CDC website says 99.9% received first dose. Seems like something wrong data. Surviving COVID Vikings fan, smh cutting US too, no. I’m suggesting keeping inside. I’m suggesting go pretty normal activity, wear masks numbers better get vaccinated ASAP. Yeah asked pharmacist said could take felt sore wanted. thing possible side effect came up. first dose hypochondriac probably soon get home second dose. idea feeling sick scary me, idea day scares let honest function house may well catch fire husband 2 kids lol

And yes, lived mostly rock past year due hypochondriac/germaphobe fear unless necessary. Even though mask distancing actually made feel comfortable going places like dr appointments etc... late

Canada one first sign deals vaccines.

Why people like hate facts? Yeah, GP don’t follow priorities strictly. majority classmates aren’t properly retaining information, cheating rise, 

But use right language - preferable, disaster. prefer person, study take 201 classes fall, that's 9/11 own.

My wife college prof, teaching grindingly difficult subject, using tests last year year, grades roughly same, evidence cheating, online collaboration. mostly say like it, disaster strong. HIV positive roommate got vaccinated. rich. That's sad hear. I'm BC cases reaching records highs now. google coronavirus vaccine numbers get page without bunch bloat That's totally different selfish perspective case, I'm latter category, due nature job ever change, least point never enter office. also resent transition decentralized working arrangements it, number reasons. environmental benefits alone would striking, less time money wasted roads cars, less lives wasted sitting traffic. Even still go workplace, begrudge anyone else might not. directly benefits either way, doesn't, indirectly benefits me. real downside, misgivings solely responsibility whoever them. long run, whether job worked home probably become selling point employers, put pressure figure parts job done remotely. Eventually, even job could situation couple people physically office day, could let us rotating schedule working home commuting work. would take less effort use google find fucking wrong everything typed type lol. exactly. people like ""what hell, *have to* get flu shot go back campus"". realizing (or caring) COVID needs treated like MMR, polio, etc, due spreading easily &amp; causing much worse health problems contracted vaccinate everyone end July

*Happy Oktoberfest noises.* Sorry misread original question. 

Thought talking death, matters.

You made point though. Whether it’s 2.5x less hospitalizations 13x less deaths, shouldn’t lumped together. Hmm, vaccine again, forget? DEAD version virus ejected body order immune system develop antibodies said virus? LIVE version virus ejected body order immune system develop antibodies said virus? Unless new variant emerges Brazil evade vaccine. set clock back least 6 months. Everybody’s sharing experiences thought I’d share pro tip: get shot, flap arms every often like you’re chicken dance, majorly cuts soreness. Somebody gave tip already first dose Moderna ton arm pain/reduced mobility worked amazingly second dose. PA use reusables, pack ourselves. Store personnel touching them. Well put. sums thinking accurate wording. Living Brazil, attest true. ☹️ Berlin clubs currently testing stations. ;) I’m medical professional, based read think fine. Maybe ask person administers shot doctor sure? FWIW, everyone know fully vaccinated far says little side effects first shot worse side effects second. pseudovirus live virus tests? There's going huge increase availability too.

Remember company Maryland fucked 15 million doses J&amp;J vaccine?

Sounds bad right?

Apparently, they've already produced 150 MILLION doses J&amp;J vaccine - can't distribute yet facility approved FDA.  Even accepting need time fill finishing, we're going hit point (likely months US basically done vaccinating) there's going absolute flood vaccine supply. mom Covid November got vaccine February still taste smell. taste vinegar things strong tastes nothing that.  read. studied... gotta ur research man. MRNA “studied” 3 decades. reason could implement vaccine quickly literally that. Narrator : ""it not"" Taiwan use hotel quarantine

This false. See choose hotel quarantine, home quarantine government group quarantine facility. electronically monitored cell limit number spaces limit risk positive cases getting in.

This done without restricting entry hotel quarantine failure every 3 weeks Covid entered community needed contained contact tracing

This enforcement issue solved without restricting entry citizens. instance, fines: 2 quarantine failures worker infected last 2 weeks. level risk become unmanageable

This unmanageable. UK variant first popped up, Taiwan halved flights UK Taiwan. travelers flew UK quarantine government group quarantine facility conditions reduce risk significantly allowing citizens enter country. Yeah knew before. feeling symptom except arm getting little sore. little hypochondriac want take meds get symptoms. hope lower vaccine immune response. Norway slower Germany? Shouldn’t basically same? chance dying covid young virtually 0 (Canada) going exceed USA’s lowest infection rate long time 

Yes, that’s happens different places different trend lines. crossing doesn’t mean equalize. They’re equal-volume reservoirs equal altitudes. There’s equalization mechanism Moderna J&amp;J absolutely manufactured Melbourne. Google it, dickhead. “Covid vaccine ibuprofen”

Fuck off. ridiculous, unless another condition old theres little chance dying covid probably dont need vaccine Yes, change way buildings designed. Like putting air returns ground create airflow pulls virus down. Dang. Seems like long Bolsonario President Brazil able overcome Covid. that’s literally every disease. Stop treating public health restrictions voluntary measure. Yeah mostly sore arm maybe little fatigue took ibuprofen hours shot anticipate symptoms. took dose bed woke next day 8hours apart. thinking 2nd dose afraid experiencing symptoms may screwed effectiveness Oh yeah, definitely getting booster, nice know there's _something_ (and decent something that) first one! get shots get greencard. US Federal Government requires certain list vaccinations even become US permanent resident. There's tons precedence kind stuff. also 100% support cruise lines requiring vaccination too. requirement everywhere. Every German would said one week ago. don’t think anyone blame Trudeau particular this, careful structure deals dependent single exporting country. Canada ordered lots vaccines [bet heavily ones weren’t fast get depends country really, country high level vaccine hesitancy yes passporting stick place directly incentivising vaccination.

However high level vaccine uptake benefit really limited window reopening population level vaccine immunity. 

This window US maybe 6/8 weeks uptake exceeding expectations. high uptake US historically medium hesitancy country possibly good sign western countries achieve population immunity. 

International travel somewhat complex argument certain countries agree vaccine passport waivers medium term countries high domestic uptakes. short term travel passporting almost certain unavoidable. Work home much reason get sick.

I worked home 3 years never got sick winter.

I went back working around people sure thing...a flu winter, even shot.

This past year, working home get sick. First off, welcome Pfizer club! Congrats! 
Secondly, it’s going hurt real bad wake :) Based handled n95 supply last year, I’m also skeptical. think long take after, before, it’s fine. 10 year old isolated kids age, you, everyone zero idea get couple months back person. He's still better farm kids, kids tiger moms make study 14 hours day, Amish. 95% effectiveness symptoms, every 100 persons would develop symptoms period time 5 vaccine. Effectiveness infection, i.e. testing positive, tested phase 3 trials, data suggested effectiveness still pretty good 95%, can't find moment. Even 95% set people would test positive larger one people would develop symptoms, many people still test positive despite vaccine.

False positives PCR unusual unless sample contaminated. Dude you’re prob gonna want something lol. 

Don’t get wrong, I’m glad got mine I’d tell anyone eligible get theirs, second dose sucked me. mild symptoms? According CDC 90 kids 0-4 died whole pandemic 500k (im guessing condition) risk doesnt seem high **Apr. 9, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

It's you. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* children (25% population) can't get vaccinated. even mildly symptomatic Covid patients getting long- haul symptoms, including youth. data Covid affects health long-term. 

Exhibit a. chicken pox? Recovered? still risk shingles rest life. People got vaccinated chicken pox contain dormant shingles/pox virus waiting activate person gets stressed.

Exhibit B. hepatitis herpes? might feel better, never really goes away risk flare-up rest life. Covid really clear body? 

A child struggle heart condition rest life 20-40% adults ignorant best. Adults able make choice climb mountain sit couch. Children opportunity make choice yet. okay take them.

The CDC saying happen.(I don’t think DOOM happen)
When CDC taking “impending doom” mean short term(like next weeks.) Mandatory vaccine violates freedom choice. Vaccine passports violates freedom movement Pfizer delivered much doses Italy AZ, though. odds low, stakes charts.

In state, single incredibly medically fragile person 17 age group died it. pediatrician office (multiple doctors) seen 75 kids positive covid, exactly zero side effects long hauling.

The odds low, stakes high children walking school everyday, walking across crosswalk two kids hit killed two years ago.

But still walk school,.across street, obvious reasons. Got J&amp;J shot. Hilton beach. 

I got tylenol electrolytes. Tomorrow half day friday. Lets goooo! I'm purely talking ethical issues here. limits degree encourage people something bodies, shutting society cross line.

When unvaccinated, form elevated public health risk, end day, 3/4 people vaccinated enough. get shut society state socially undesirable behaviours either. think WFH going away time soon. Companies going risk alienating 34% workforce, option remotely working competitors without move. Areas seeing surges generally take covid less seriously less vaccine uptake demand.

Continue allocate population, don’t redistribute supply areas less demand. month away enough anyone wants it. solicitor general literally said today modelling predicted numbers ICU waited act wanted ""to make sure modelling actually showing hospitals"". incompetence. think simply incorrect. numerous studies analysis show vaccines 80-90% effective 12-14 days first Reddit comment whole thread pretty good.

Some confusion comes numbers presented. 1, 2, 4 even 7-10 days first dose little protection, ramps quickly 12-14 days. Würzburg kinda cool. Regensburg.
Don't visit huge cities want see germany like. Goes country actually. friend's mom ICU allergic reaction March 26 7-day average 5,662 new cases/day.

Today, April 8, 7-day average 3,072 new cases/day.

This decrease 45% 7-day average rate period 14 days. got curious investigated - sadly etymology “logistics” unrelated logarithmic growth. comes French word “logistique”; “art moving, quartering, supplying troops”, turn came “lodge” (as lodging).

Logarithm, hand, comes “logos” (proportion) “arithmos” (number) - literally “proportional number” original Greek.

That said, “logistics logarithmic” still fantastic slogan, even isn’t rooted actual word origins ;) plus call house Arzt Flair changed. bonus square. Everyone originally tested sense vaccinated no-longer getting tested due cdc fauccis direction to.

Your explanation makes sense, thank explaining see it.

I want point though, everyone vaccinated stopped taking tests. I've 3 COVID tests since fully vaccinated, stopped testing, others not.

My understanding routine testing healthcare workers nursing home residents longer required- see tied vaccinated people (though many vaccinated now). 2 years childhood basically wasted pretty freaking bad. feel terrible person. that?

My reasoning better wait bit instead semi protected new country. would take trade off. got sick 6 months years ago. Still GI issues day. didn’t expect world stop turning it. is. That's hospitals colapsed. wish there'd politicians like Bhutanese government. seem around decent people. I’ve never denied it. I’m vaccinated. accept level risk life utterly incapable of. cannot expect everyone give everything risk assessment says it’s zero it’s safe now. USA tagged? No?

Literally every government world multiple things once.

Can explain exactly attorney general handle leaking lakes? point one devise weighing methods prefer Sweden Finland, one can't devise weighing methods put Sweden outside range Nordic + Baltic countries. Sweden typical region. 
 sure started talk countries suddenly ok. 
 
Perhaps reread thread then? 
The question always whether Sweden exceptional region typical. 
 
Your referred weighing measures arbitrary support claim weighing measures better ordinary population densities. measures treat small compact towns similar individual city blocks big city, completely disregarding public transport impacts work environments. do, understand figures provided include GPs specialists primary care? great grandma also. Took shot whiskey every night bed. Finally stopped working elder care 94, died years that. know mean time tell. Trust hope I'm wrong 4 months come say congrats us. We've nearly completely eliminated covid US. great day. Again? glad kids risk children necessarily themselves, spread, especially thanks UK variant. children vaccinated immensely lower risk COVID persistent epidemic. Glad dark-age-bureaucracy-land finally something purpose vaccine purpose encourage lazy get ass get vaccinated. effective vaccination open everyone Except wasn’t point asked explanation doesn’t work personally . point it’s accurate precise hand. result ideas weren’t clearly conveyed took longer convey them. Guess they've never heard vasovagal reflex. Fucking morons. Competent governments mean. medical staff break

That's signed first place, I've discovered medical staff absolutely love there's tons competition shifts. understand why, dealing people anything wrong mostly relieved grateful get vaccine. low stress compared hospital setting, generally easy interactions.

But love too, they'll deal longer! define “sufficiently studied” qualifies make distinction?

I’m asking take away agency, everyone free choose whatever want, consequences choosing take extend beyond you. Trump managed one thing right, warp speed. Thanks got multiple vaccines choose from. Otherwise world fighting Pfizer now. That’s family Detroit area.  signed daughter list got texted days later getting first dose Sunday. rich americas cup sponsors etc would say still practice mitigation strategies, still mask, still distance, try keep crowds minimum,"" Walensky said. ""Because really think get country vaccinated, get back healthier, normal evening baseball field.""

I really, really hope isn’t necessary fall. knows country vaccinated. Hopefully summer Covid back October got first shot Pfizer today. Arm little sore felt little tired/weak hours later. Otherwise, feeling pretty good!

I second dose scheduled one day birthday. I'm planning huge celebration definitely planning something smaller circle, however seeing people feel really bad second dose I'm wondering whether reschedule day birthday... Same. definitely needs top. can’t find otherwise link thread brings website mobile reason Oh hi DeSantis. blamed media reporting CoVID19.

Only states like. agree media sometimes overly sensational hospitals collapsing reach one states listed mean everyone emergency outright denied care.

But mean excess mortality happen. extra deaths happen immediately (when people Covid serious medical incidents properly monitored treated insufficient staff) years come (after people missed things like cancer screenings procedures could reduced risk heart attack).

Considering situation bad enough widespread shortages oxygen across Brazil find hard believe thousands people eventually die result overcrowded Wow good know thanks. think vaccines kill virus US regardless? Point taken, actually Jan 15th.

 [Estimated Disease Burden COVID-19 | I’d ask doctor sure. me, I’d get first shot offered soon could get it, sort rest later. Yes!  That’s felt.  got mine Ford Field Detroit.  amazingly efficient.  

Felt like end disaster movie like said.  Makes sense. yeah, extra stuff lets government add volunteers public, that’s fantastic. Give medical staff break Nah, Reddit strong USA population. clearly don’t believe greater good. 

If case, area locked days contact tracers get touch everyone test them. 

We haven’t much community spread yonks. I'm pretty stoked honestly. Around +54 hours sore arm, incredible level thirst, athletic straps recovery level suggests might run marathon. Oh not? Haha okay..... literally thing. need show papers get access something. Vaccines always best way end this. Credit administration seeing acting appropriately Oh, see.

I read new article seems need quarantine anymore since April 1

It make sense fully vaccinated time. I'm planning go late August-Early September! Uh oh wanted would. government wanted lot basic stuff compliance reasons. lion's share online part. Familiarisation chemistry vaccine, national vaccine guidelines, on.

It really 10 hours face face training injections, meet 8 stay 6, really get started 10 registration distancing, sorting ID checks, such. First part day first aid, already certified go it. went PPE procedures took while.

The injection training was, actively, probably less two hours. happened lot covid? seems like caused lot problems:
- 50 states outbidding PPE
- 50 states sets politicians versed science often interested playing politics listening public health officials. 
- 50 states worth public health officials need work independently figure message everything.
- many states concerned FDA manipulated reviews vaccines. 

In mind big problem covid much bad poorly communicated information. moment suggesting CDC perfect, think voices better. 

Also, imagine chaotic vaccination would managed allocated federally least minimal degree. 

The part makes harder Covid local problem. one state badly mismanages things, cases spilt neighboring states. 

In retrospect, lots things federal government could done better really hope everyone learns this, think less centralization would improved things. US is. Canada hit 230k yesterday. We've consistently vaccinating around 200k daily couple weeks now.

Germany 2.2x population Canada. Per capita they're really good. much likely think 40-49 year old gets COVID hospitilized 18-29 year old COVID? 

30x? Maybe 40x? donate blood one ;) Lmao stop $100 chlorox wipes week lot cheaper new $20k HVAC unit!  20-25% NYC covid year ago. NYC full people dementia now? It’s frankly incorrect information AMA. Quarantine recommended, longer required. That’s true J&amp;J going AZ method delivery then. you, would rather take safer vaccine die. problem UK black people Asians , particularly Muslims quite hesitant. I'm Nurse NHS trust newsletter constantly filled new webinars black Asian staff convince take vaccine information Muslims. We've quite lot concerned vaccine fasting. Apparently someone created account purely rant antimask/antilockdown shit last year. 90%'ish imports, understand AZ imported India bit EU? Sure, contribute reducing worldwide deaths much US does, first 5-7% vaccinated really worth weight gold.

Besides that, US totally could handled coronavirus crisis inline better rest world, America decided focus economy instead. then, US corporations buy rights effective vaccine candidates offload world's production US.

From I'm seeing, US costing everyone mistakes using justify selfish country world regards vaccines. There's shortage lipids actually UK interest export produce import Pfizer vaccine.
In supply/demand free economy distribution good would huge gaps like EU UK. have, non economic reasons.

Also UK imported millions Pfizer doses; British sandwich. UK also eating German american one. 

It would fine AZ miss contractual obligations EU time hiding 29M (probably more) Italy.
It ultimately company responsibility; AZ British obviously creates interesting doubts influence UK government. Covid vaccines important life economy, influence almost granted. Replicate what? Enable vaccine nationalism? Isreal received vaccines EU allows exports. it’s excuse vaccines sold can’t build proper infrastructure, manufacture vaccines first place? vaccinate people? 

Let die seems you’re insinuating. got vaccinated today. 😍 Turns restricting exports enable vaccine nationalism policies work.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thanks Joe Biden 👍 UK wanted pay Pfizer set domestic production Pfizer refused. UK importing EU that's place outside US Pfizer producing it. choice. reached ends analogy there. tragedy commons. Vaccines shared communal resource. They're product manufactured United States fill order made US government. 

Well that's simply factually true. countries like Canada outstanding orders well, can't filled, US government good drafting contracts, US government executive order preventing factories meeting demand outside US.

It even says explicitly [executive policy United States ensure **Americans priority access** free, safe, effective COVID–19 vaccines. ensuring ability meet vaccination needs American people, interest United States facilitate international access United States Government COVID–19 Vaccines. 

US first, everybody else.

Now, again, people support kind nationalism, fine, make honest argument. What's annoying get policy clearly shows US comes first, people want pretend US currently amazing international partner fighting pandemic, isn't. might become future, right isn't. Russian Chinese vaccine diplomacy pays become clear time. I'm skeptical given complaints like one. major, immediate impact people care America doing. 

I consider Russia China countries anyone try emulate. Incidence increase think enough supply vaccines younger population. buying much Pfizer/Moderna physically anyway know sure safe effective. don’t understand continuing plow vaccines, surely money supply increase coming months Cough
Australia Yay! Filled finished various EU sites, guess technically ex-EU. Moderna delivering planned, export bans happen anyways absolute shitfuck wrong dude? threat Brazil, entire planet. already one strain covid-19 coming Brazil, really need supper-immune mutant virus high mortality rates emerge? life normal months since 100 cases week, nobody died covid whole year? Even would problem, focus germany country faring relatively well ignore countries would access vaccine without eu? *Laughs British English* Moderna produced Switzerland? Nothing. monitor variants enough bandwidth.

The smart thing would cut travel low vaccination rate countries. one wants to. William Shatner 90 still looks acts 60. China also generous enough donate virus hundred million worldwide Meanwhile Australia govt. keeps messing vaccine rollout. new day new controversy excuse. Poor suckers going pop vaccinated next election Chinese vaccine seems work advertised Chile. Keep mind, efficacy Sinopharm vaccine essentially zero around 14 days second dose, point efficacy increases sharply. people Chile received second dose 14 days fact. trial results expected infected full vaccination, risk severe disease 6-7 times lower risk death essentially indistinguishable zero, making effectively flu. no, judgment Chile's strategy failed based evidence, available data studies indicate successful. 

Both Russia China vaccinating populations time countries.

And especially love completely forget mention fact EU India exact thing too, easier demonize China Russia.

The US *only* country world things way. People around world definitely remember. Congrats US! things right, now! accept massive challenge see point throwing hissy every time company want? important note proportional population size. would insane US getting comparable new infections Canada. Might happen US, Israel, UK, Chile, high vaccination rate countries. Seems like 50 percent vaccinations tripping point. Numbers hospitalizations begin rise USA though. time vaccines urgent demand, Germany 1 million unused doses sitting storage — partly people reluctant take them. enough vaccine, storage requirements / need use full vials opened considered worthwhile first distribute via large centeres less risk no-shows, etc.

Only 1/3rd number actually came GPs, integrated increase outreach finally vaccine supply increased. Correct, used vaccinate first health workers healthcare residence guests number downplayed journalist study here: consider findings highly unreliable, reasoning summary beyond flawed, decide yourself.

192 sequenced 7 times far USA, 192 worldwide. Reuters bit joke. Clickbait headline, limited context. add content often barely researched.

Could true? course.
Does article help understand true?no.
Is dangerous spew info like without facts balance? absolutely. intentionally spoiled vaccines big issue US? don’t think ever heard happening U.K. Brazil variant appears capable reinfecting people got virus's original version. Probably Brazil much ""fun"".

So, low old virus good virus. bad take. seen surge anti Vax beliefs driven social media. bad enough covid, ridiculous. large chunk US global population get vaccine. valid health crisis statements true. Pardon me, pharmacist here, you’re unfortunately incorrect chickenpox vaccinated persons getting shingles.

In fact, it’s quite opposite. Wildtype chickenpox infection actually protective chickenpox vaccine shingles.
 
Many people (even younger “normal” shingles age group) chickenpox vaccine get shingles. 
 
Now, getting shingles vaccine best protection shingles, prior points remain same.

Let clear here, though. fully pro-vaccine. 

Covid completely different ballgame. Vaccine *much* better wildtype Covid-19 protection. Yup. got first dose yesterday, due second 5th. I... honestly know I'm going go public again. totally correct. different possible vectors, best example Sputnik V vaccine. first second dose use different vectors. first one AZ J&amp;J, second one different. Thus, use second Sputnik dose booster AZ J&amp;J. creators made way, since expected problem happen, AZ J&amp;J encountered. fact quite beginner mistake AZ J&amp;J used conventional system (which reason Sputnik available fast, alongside Sinovac.) mRNA vaccines took longer, rely experimental system. success basically luck.

The mRNA vaccines better types vaccines, equally effective Sputnik vaccine shows. fact took even longer produce them. seems way, failure AZ J&amp;J, -as pointed out- beginner mistake using vector twice. least used different vectors, AZ J&amp;J would effective combined.... combine second Sputnik (also first dose) Croatia bad too. Yes, go extra hard refusing anything useful like closing schools forcing companies let people work home. referring this: it’s incapable - think unwilling - understanding that’s good him! Iran Argentina too, steep increase. worry, likely 25-33% US pop anti covid vaxxers get it. assume enough supply everyone soon enough us still remember &amp; us still needs done. could seriously crush virus US right will. guess wait &amp; drag long possible 😒 Sorry yes meant worse. government forced employers allow staff working home opened schools. restrictions things private nothing anything work. It’s obvious won’t touch companies. Hundreds people working big offices wearing masks surprised control things. opened schools time actually go harder. would done had. ignore scientists worried ones society shout loudest. Well, Trump said takes responsibility Covid deaths *must* Biden's fault. we're working psycho republican logic. uk manufacturing fucked, it’s kept quiet leaders AZ don’t get pissy us. trolling right? Copper, man. Gotta get patina. would very, bad many countries. perspective, yes, kind of. Obviously context would made lot less inflammatory, clickbait works. Fair enough. companies I've worked know universal. Good know. Oh right. vaccines sit used. people complain US actually want get vaccinated. understand all, surely person touches bag either way? Canadian. lockdowns abysmal vaccine rate pathetic leadership. don’t think communication EU stellar, think Reuters making something nothing here. 

That UK vaccine roll dependent EU production pretty clear, since importing Pfizer Moderna. defending EU production, arguably gotten much better last weeks see vaccination numbers countries like Francs Germany. No, spectacular. exaggerating turning entrance area ""parking lot."" spewing bullshit, basically. They're cleaning area gets dirty nothing covid. used describe inanimate object colour Haha downvoted I'm right?!?! Yes, almost countries allow visa applications country non citizenship. get sick shot might already Covid didn’t know it. You’ll good go soon. Hey hey southerner here, don’t paint broad brush. Many us (in larger cities, especially) do. ""Priority-supply deals, export restrictions means hoarding rich nations contributed severe global supply crunch left many countries scrambling."" 

Here Denmark, beginning year already bought vaccines needed vaccinate everyone country summer. Suddenly suppliers like Pfizer decided prioritize U.S. vaccine plan keeps getting pushed back. 

An article CNN framed situation ""EU shit getting people vaccinated, American expats mad, going home vaccinated universal healthcare sucks,"" none context many us EU getting screwed precisely U.S. scooped vaccines us.

Weirdly, morphed ""America's best!"" mentality even among expats. conversation group expats facebook got horrifying reply ""U.S. right thing buying vaccines EU could get them.""

This pandemic really brought worst us. That's parking lot. entrance area people spill stuff leave gum make mess. shortest article quote snippet sentence. Would killed Reuters add context? want microchip track everything do!

Apparently not, otherwise harped ""US vaccines"".

Of course can. chose to, mostly. far, one batch AZ denied Australia March, mechanism place monitors exports ban deemed necessary. US cannot force exports. really, comments make whole lot sense. Talk person gives shot. doctor recommended Tylenol specifically said avoid ibuprofen. Also stock Gatorade/pedialyte poll YouGov, carried change official guidance Wednesday, found 75 per cent people considered Oxford vaccine safe — two percentage points since March. level public confidence similar vaccine, considered safe 78 per cent polled.  survey also found younger people retained confidence Oxford jab, although lower levels older age groups. Among aged 18-24 almost two thirds said vaccine safe, three points March, 68 per cent 25 49-year-olds said same.  age groups, 13 per cent considered Oxford vaccine unsafe, 12 per cent know. people smartening taking experimental phase 3 clinical trial drug yet tested long term. fucking appointment EU leader. Without vaccines, yes need zero COVID go back normal, get need keep way. sufficient percentage population vaccinated, think reopening travel comes much risk you’re willing take variants. insanity last year, think it’s pretty crazy want e.g. open travel Brazilian American tourists risk ending immune escape variant puts way back square one again. Whyyyyy garage mopped? like luxury hotel something? assume must young? mid-40’s &amp; husband &amp; moderna relatively mild aftermath... sure eager teens get shot &amp; little worried wrecked might feel 😬 Japan’s hopeless inefficiency creating vaccine program USA’s vaccine production.

If US companies producing US, would US share it? Well may lowered immune response. late guess. plan 2nd shot, cannot day. need function house may well catch fire. time, less-deadly strains win more-deadly strains. viruses kill hosts, get spread. Whats point wear mask? worry canada- republican governors setting us fourth wave coming weeks, able blow back past you.

u.s.a! u.s.a! u.s.a!!! Pretty sure saw thing component Pfizer vaccine comes uk. Vaccinating kids crucial want really over. hope studies go well (and take long finish).  Well late. point hypochondriac expect kid understand Arent us standards poverty beyond acceptable? US based companies, vaccine produced eu us. us isn‘t allowing vaccines exported outside country without special authorization az received mexico canada believe? EU noticed UK 4 different vaccines manufactured domestically - ignoring whatever import (which EU anyway)? Good news offtiopic. 94 percent 50s England vaccine impossible. various reasons, take 50s likely less though wait see final figures Yes, EU citizen hold animosity towards US decision ban exports ""fixed"" home. sure rub wrong way people talk US good neighbor help us re: Covid-19 vaccine supply need vaccine now. US played big part got bad, i.e. US leadership (and civilians) driving force behind downplaying Covid-19, legitimizing taking seriously. Yes, Pfizer Moderna US companies. exporting to? Well late guess Idc getting symptoms. *cries Pakistani*   Oh sorry. 
Yes EU producing mentioned vaccines multiple locations. used eu externally. eu made vaccination distribution eu issue members don‘t precure vaccines own. 

We roughly export 50% vaccine produce. late guess. Time tell get covid19 Israel still diagnosing several hundred COVID cases per day therefore premature say they’ve eliminated COVID safely return “normalcy” (e.g. allowing unrestricted travel). also saw India ship 5.5 million doses gift various countries. Exporting whom? opposite true — Israel appears achieved herd immunity, effectively eliminated virus. Countries “eliminated” virus non-pharmaceutical interventions rely perpetual enforcement intervention order maintain figures, cannot return back normalcy herd immunity achieved vaccination. asking, Countries Europe exporting vaccines outside Europe instead vaccinating inside. vaccine it.

For example, sent Canada vaccines, AstraZeneca approved here. trying get context. Wall Street Journal [recently 8% American adults ""definitely get vaccinated"".

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* *I remember username* really unbiased though, ignores single important thing: National Defense Act. EU exported almost 50% domestic production, US exported pretty much none it. would still difference doses give out, would much, much smaller EU done same. think overestimating difficulty admitting we're wrong common humans, unfortunately.

Eg, even Australia there's lot people claiming lockdowns unnecessary, even large outbreak Victoria clearly growing exponentially state went lockdown.  us vaccinating 16 over, places lot 60+ unvaccinated. surprised all? US nutshell. You’re pedantic. point stands. US well ahead Canada terms vaccinations quite case rates haven’t intersected yet. want mean case rates 5 days ago people got infected, guest. 

Of course point Canada going exceed US case rate. Everybody understands that. 

I’m sure you’re going come snarky comment. can’t wait. understand question then? asked "" vaccine that’s developed EU company manufactured EU company EU soil? ""

Janssen European company, US owner. Production Leiden (NL), also USA deliveries. 

The time make batch Biontech vaccine 120 days beginning current aim get 60 days.. would say doses delivered today started July?

As marked, Curevac use yet, still fits bill (and production started)

There drama around 3 deliver well could expected. also expected (like Sanofir turned be)  would dud. vaccine drama centered around AZ overpromises underdelivery (and communicationg it).

The second drama probably USA starts stockpile vaccines vaccinated domestically - worry idications USA insist keeping export ban untill deliveries made - even got stock. Given pattern spread, almost certainly originated uk. alternative developed one abroad, came kent, spread uk rather country origin, seems less likely. Europe trying increase production long process complex facilities. $440 biontech, Pfizer got headstart from, might making vaccines end 2021. EU assumed US would allow level playing field, US didn't. Looks incredibly bad white house pushing increase US credibility again. Well, also 150mil+ people vaccinated degree, small parties much worry anymore. Come April 19 states open everyone getting vaccine, cases fall. gatherings happening even 4-6 months ago covid rate dropping India surprise everyone. Social distancing India always going challenge. 

I think conclusions drawn crowds simplistic, there's lot learn makes covid spread. Humans tendency hastily fix blame move on, rather conclusively understand problem. massive protests didn’t help Yeah sums reality talking problems life reason desire fix it. Hey least past first step ""being aware"" issue good right?

Literally open windows would fair amount.

Airflow matters!

I remember first time meeting friends outside super early covid, like last March. think bringing masks.

We nervous sitting outside, masked, 10+ foot distance.

Then realized dock 10-20 mph winds. could spewing particles wanted, they'd going downrange fast. fair Raytheon gives bonuses like, everything.

I got job offer them. $10,000 bonuses year 1 lol would guess numbers quite low Japan, good discipline hygene measures all? think trump's teams negotiating pharma cos vaccine purchasing right gamble. Europe negotiated hard price per shot also trying get take liability. 

The right gamble banning exports via National Defense Act. matters. almost zero price difference EU US. difference one exporting half domestic production exports none. That's it. want jack college prices providing even less services. Rolling bread. Yeah wonder yet see someone? Look replies simple questions. sure bunch teenager oh well.
Thanks answer Russia China screw populations without repercussions dictatorships.

If Biden giving away vaccines Americans get dose, he'd thrown office Democrats would lose credibility years come. fair, correct analogy hogging water put last tiny smoke plumes, whilst neighbor's house blazing inferno.

It's already case parts US administering vaccines healthy 20 year olds, whilst Canada lack supply vaccinate 60+ people critical underlying conditions like diabetes put exposed risk.

I think frustration comes dishonesty. people want argue nationalist perspective, country goes first matter cost anyone else, that's fine, least make argument.

Right get weird attitude Americans boasting hypothetical future vaccine deliveries they'll make, despite actively policy harms countries.

Low risk Americans getting put first line, ahead high risk Canadians. people support that, fine, support that, try pretend that's happening. Meanwhile 79+ lol get herd immunity need around 80% population immunity. UK hit hard, number infections around 4.5 million - around 7% population...if we're generous assume lot people infected without tested (so double it) still 14% waaaaay percentage required herd immunity. don’t know levels right now. know were, average, 10 days ago that’s influenced current policy infection rate time people infected. still bargaining power EU apparently... Jeez that's awful :/ ditch seat placards hospital waiting rooms too?

Glad CDC catching anyone brain 11-12 months ago.

Hell job guys! countries better infrastructure place, wrap-around headcanon, willingness damage stock market via life-saving lockdowns, wear masks without ""my freedom"" hysteria. Please actually provide source this, family medicine physician Belgium ordered JnJ vaccines super at-risk population. going receive mail 14 days delivery could plan pick-up. received news yet. also using kilometers kilograms instead funny units matter. make international students show proof Tuberculosis vaccination let begin class. different. Yeah, mom never got covid worse side effects 2nd dose. Basically body aches morning shot, although went away afternoon. hand, uncle, got covid December, said felt like crap getting 1st shot.

I'm getting J&amp;J single shot Saturday! Lmao mean Europe rejected American influence move money built new system money avoid sanctions?

Where America throw money Europe problem solved? Yeah, Russia asking Vaccines back Countries complaining. Chinese vaccine work worth shit Chile.

Its almost like vaccinate population first demonstrate care citizens, vaccine worth damn. Biontech Pfizers, Moderna AZ Belgium, Germany Switzerland. sure else. 
What asking? Israel actually hasn’t eliminated coronavirus you’re ignoring multiple countries actually non-pharmaceutical interventions. court said Czech Republic allowed require children attending school vaccinated. Lol. BS. US put real ban. UK put de-facto ban. 

Do really believe government influence company based country? plenty ways, even indirect ones. 

Facts yesterday US UK export nothing. EU exported Million doses. UK coverage 55%, EU coverage 18%. whole bloc vaccines. EU exporting roughly half domestically produced vaccines, 80 million doses end march. ask opinion, gently f... That's metric really matters.

The jump 0% immune 80%~ immune much important jump 95%. whoever made decision procedure obsessed fool? Asking question post dealing ""irrationallity"", bothered pass go along.  throw variants concern mix. vaccine rendered essentially worthless fight COVID? vaccine referring to? Thanks lot.
Yeah figured bunch kids Essentially every country world vaccinating exporting time. means EU countries produce vaccines, Russia, China, India, etc... hate crime Irish people Utopia totalitarianism never work impossible achieve.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* can‘t trust european countries. mean Europe found way keep moving *money*. Japanese agency examines new medicines says domestic testing necessary cases clinical trial data available overseas existing coronavirus vaccines tailored new variants.

This new policy announced Pharmaceuticals Medical Devices Agency, PMDA, screening COVID-19 vaccines going forward.

The agency says drug makers seek approval vaccines modified authorized ones response variants, data overseas clinical trials used confirm safety efficacy.

Experts pointed coronavirus variants may reduce effectiveness existing vaccines. prompted drug makers develop new ones variants.

In principle, Japan requires domestic clinical trials approval vaccines. Officials say agency's new policy may shorten time needed approve vaccines variants. going end soon. exclude better others Europe.

Do mean worse?

But always recommended practice contagious pandemic - close early reduce impact future. Whenever one dealing exponential growth, quicker one reacts better.

It pretty grim countries surrounding Germany well Germany UK variant 70% contagious people tired necessary lockdown meeting up. central EU stage UK last November, fortunately least old people vaccinated.

I saw easter, multiple cars one person inside arriving houses, clearly easter lunch. police aggressive enforcing measures? 

I understand could done better government resources legal options available time. much happier Germany UK. shit everyone, everywhere. enough vaccine anywhere. EU export UK, AZ/Pfizer did.

The UK send vaccines Australia, AZ did.

Companies countries. nothing UK stop AZ sending vaccines wherever want unless put export ban. breach contract, could settle court - all. everyone ones vaccinated? Boo fucking hoo hundreds died millions vaccinated. might covid didn’t know it. People usually get symptoms first dose, much second. hopefully that’s case second mild! Yeah guys, SUPER ULTRA DOUBLE MUTANT CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE incoming! No. Trump pushing get vaccine election - deemed safe. wouldn’t taking either available early P.R. doctors saying weren’t sure yet. 

Trump’s dummy supporters. What’s funny true regardless poor decisions Trump made, people downvoting it.

I still remember Trump pilloried experts claimed vaccine would ready soon. Yet somehow.

Maybe trump broken clock. You’re “it’s flu camp” still think you’re right single center retrospective paper? doesn’t say anything covid “harmless kids” (your words) address huge burden covid (a current pandemic) society children known vector. It’s also year old light years covid research doesn’t address benefits vaccination symptoms comorbidities. really don’t energy. Best luck. someone double vaccinated missed concerts much, pumped event! global political/economic system prioritizes financial well-being small number people work vaccine manufacturers, ending probably biggest global catastrophe since WWII.

You realize 9 million people year die hunger? Compared maybe 3 million far covid. 

This massive catastrophe developed nations old developing world. Make sure take Tylenol! Perfectly safe. made mistake tried power it. Big mistake. think so. think Baltimore plant approval shipped doses plant (AZ J&amp;J).  

 coronavirus pandemic arrived, factory became main U.S. location manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines developed Johnson &amp; Johnson AstraZeneca, churning 150 million doses last week.  far single dose usable regulators yet certified factory allow vaccines distributed public.** Last week, Emergent said would destroy 15 million doses’ worth Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine contamination AstraZeneca vaccine discovered. run hot. I’m constantly told fever 103-105. temp taken automatically, I’m sure I’d ever allowed work again. Fortunately boss pretty good telling come inside stand air conditioner.... point question accuracy thermometer even more! friend brazil said heaps friends sick 3 4000 people dying day. Best believe US won’t stop ramping production till world vaccinated. 4 million day low. producing already. fall flooding vaccines seas much higher rates that. 🥅 🏃‍♂️ even last weeks living like decade, i.e. without constant stream love praise friends, family, snd strangers. Congrats, understand male privilege.   Instead took money big ass contract US signed...  Got first dose yesterday. want actual cases happened, Details still bit fuzzy, but: 117 hospitalization data entered, 11 hospitalized, 103 hospitalized, 3 reported unknown,"" Sutfin three deaths ""all persons 65 years older, two within three weeks completion vaccination,"" said. ""While majority population develops full immunity within 14 days completion vaccine series, small proportion appear take longer mount full antibody response. CDC actively working better understand risk characteristics group.""

So basically bit much say 100% effective, clearly one case wasn't. they'll researching cases closely I'm sure. mean get general sentiment it’s like everybody dead still business form.

I’m done pedantic please continue day. I've never seen anyone get mad masks, things... Store self checkout, busy couple even move cart leave paying stupid things way folks carts towards center. apologized everyone trying get us move carts could leave dude loses knock one going ""We went whole pandemic without things, think we'll ok! here, stupid!"" got leftover Pfizer today, second dose April 29th. stores let us bring cloth bags self checkout lane, you’re going regular one. make small trips bring cloth bags. need make larger trips, suck deal plastic bags. Oh well. They’re good scooping cat litter into.  That’s exactly I’m suggesting. I’m honestly sure follow post. saying schools shouldn’t open adults vaccinated still scared around unvaccinated kids? someone scared getting sick dying Covid they’ve vaccinated, really feel sorry them. Perhaps working school setting isn’t anymore. I’m mathematician, disease 99.5% survival rate anyone 65 unvaccinated almost 100% fully vaccinated. Life cannot stop everyone still scared disease they’ve fully vaccinated for. understand child immunocompromised would want keep school enough enough. stand said, adults either vaccinated opportunity vaccinated, kids TK-12 need back classroom 100% fall masks social distancing. 

By way, put words mouth. never called unvaccinated adults idiots. vaccinated? course, it’s place call idiots anything else. they’ve opportunity get refuse, life needs resume pandemic normal. cart wipes standard everywhere? pandemic every store city one. Now, insist cleaning carts took away wipes, partly cleaning wipe shortage partly customers would steal they’d run out. staff sanitizing carts every use. 

I already miss cart wipes! wonder that’ll change April 20... that’s 100 days masks whatever said. 

Apr 21st mean Ah, glad know fever dream Shit, thanks reminder. keto eating lot berries reason never remember drench water first. also just...sad. legitimately hate everyone job that's one thing (and get new job), typical person spends time work family. really hard actually try even little bit social? mean honestly bad policy move US, good internal policy. Russia China RAMPING vaccine diplomacy efforts take advantage. Trump, Biden looking reclaim lost influence/American credibility global stage reliable partner. going set back work least 2022 got JnJ afternoon &amp; presently feeling like dumpster fire. Likely staying home work tomorrow. 😞  bust laughing everytime redditors talk sanitizing groceries. damn funny imagine. Enjoy 5g. internet much faster today. /s  parents would rather die take vaccine ties Bill Gates. would also die without newest mobile phone.

This world live in. really though. think shelf life vaccine 6 months? still lacking infrastructure vaccinate enough people bad decision sell vaccines imo USA reaches 70% see instant recovery pandemic. 20% isn’t great yet context. given fast vaccinate maybe 4 months it. end summer might normal USA. hope cleaning requirements stick around though. I’ve seen people work (pre-pandemic) come sick hell wipe snot place. remember one time wiped hammer Mr Stinky Pants used said “that first time life hammer get cleaned. that’s sad.” 

A month later, covid hit state clean everything. feel like kind jinxed us :P 

But real, went working restaurant everything got cleaned lot working factory nothing got cleaned covid used drive nuts couldn’t sanitize things. I’m going need source that. Poverty Chile standards, US standards, global standards. Unlike person responding to, realize Chile way developed people realize, highly doubt less poverty US. doctor explain bloot clot issue AstraZeneca her?

It's news now. wonder AstraZeneca stopped everywhere scientists study mechanism risk factors. Strong agree. Felt nothing. get flu shots yearly feel those. nothing needle wise. Never said “many died!”

You literally said ""multiple people died."" Given small sample sizes, within margin error?

I checked details yet- genuine question. Pfizer/Moderna peoples roughly age, ethnicity, socioeconomic situation, etc? assumed studies like controlling questions ask here, no? 

Again, genuinely know here... Depends count shitlist. AZ still favourable cost-benefit ratio elderly. seem many unvaccinated elderly left. Sorry blocking EU exports guys better control.. Germany stand side more. one lowest vaccination rates europe hell lot idiots didn‘t want get shot either. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

I got second vaccine today, know side effects are? feel bit tired, took nap, felt like lying bed hours afterwards.

Now mostly feel better, albeit still little tired.

Seriously, side effects less flu shot read this, thanks British Columbia data March:

It's nice see something backing anecdotally observed. I’m really suggesting anything I’m saying pre 2020 papers I’ve read border closures, mainly influenza pandemic guides, say basically, close border 99.9% effectively don’t bother. Considering it’s already sides community spread, “don’t bother” probably option now.

I don’t think tight, like said, allow “essential workers/services” number people cross vaccination quarantine. really screwing citizens. looks good paper US one highest vaccinated country world. However, Canadian, feel comfortable giving credit plenty times US blocked getting vaccine shipment Canada. even remember PPE blocked US custom getting Ontario. US also EU. Canada one earliest secure vaccine shipment ended getting fucked US EU. Right now, 55 getting vaccinated due vaccine shortage. People ended blaming local government getting enough vaccines enough supplies coming country. traveling Canada seemed like guns hunting. think overthinking it. take anything preemptively, personally. feel quite sore, take ibuprofen. 

And keep mind, symptoms feel temporary! got this! *Nobody* said “*all* 70-year-olds shut-ins.” You’re one painting broad brushes. hope Canada least switches “one shot everybody first” UK method seems working. new variants decimating us.

I hope Canada least switches “one shot everybody first” UK method seems working. new variants decimating us. Fellas looks like might actually go back normal summer : 100 million least one dose vaccine 10s millions natural immunity Covid infection, yet still 80k cases today 7-day moving average keeps increasing? someone explain what’s going on?  really know pal. Already 2 doses moderna living life well :) know anyone priority group able get vaccine? 2nd Moderna shot last week. Nothing sore arm day injection. next day body aches over, fever, chills, lot fatigue. awake maybe 5 hours total whole day. next day bodyaches fatigue, bad day fever.

Yeah sucked honestly took tylenol tolerable. flue January 2020 much worse vaccine side effects. sucked, compare flu me. I've never happier sick. first 200 weeks. 4 years HVAC, raking savings! Actually, mass vaccinating prophylaxis vaccine middle pandemics, actually forcing virus mutate dangerous, virulent mutants, target younger people. Everyone talking Israel, look Italy, vaccinating since December, cases still going people still getting sick dying.  said there’s “too much misinformation vaccines there, particularly social media.” operator plans work employees still doubts fears vaccine.

“We understand respect people cautious hesitant get vaccination early rounds. science experience show us benefits far outweigh risk,” said. 

“We’re ready sit employee talk facts,” continued. “And hope don’t lose single employee this. know getting vaccination best way keep employees safe. we’re also going clear: mandatory employees.” 70 90% probably. too. First one nothing second knocked ass night. Sore lymph-nodes next 5 days.  American citizen living Australia last 4 years, maybe forced fly US get vaccines don’t receive end year. work remote work won’t problem either spent almost whole year staying apartment waiting vaccine strong restrictions. get vaccine done waiting longer waiting next moving target. Plan go EDC event want going forward. clearly acting bad faith. Slovaks violated contract sending sample EU certified lab. customers doesn’t reek trust confidence.

Weird (but unsurprising) way phrase it. complaining. That's one they're smeared lied about, Slovaks did. 

They got vaccine russians fulfilled obligations contract. Slovaks decided smear country political turmoil. 

Only one side demanding doses tested EU certified lab. Stop it. thought ""herd immunity"" far-right loony conspiracy theory, though? cases 20% week USA yet lead many major countries vaccinations last month. Sometimes check rest world doing. Canada vacuum Aren’t new strains contagious deadly? virus thrives spread well. can’t likely eradicate time people become vaccinated resistance grows. Gaming commission said May much higher 50% allow based % employees casino vaccinated. math. Really? remember people proclaiming end sight, obviously 2020. vaccines really going people's arms, percentage people vaccinated slowly buy inexorably increases, likely see US happened Israel last month so. Ordered... Totally agreed! Probably pay sick time anyway. well trained people hardworking go work sick. /s.  even bother learn topic?

You bother mention analysis doses Slovakia independant violated contract signed. Russia demanding Slovaks send sample EU certified lab clear reputation. zero lingering questions efficacy safety. National regulators 59 different countries approved it. Slovak government specifying way vaccine different, claims simply is. hilarious. way different form vaccine. 3 different forms VACCINE: freeze-dried, stock solution needs diluted ready use solution. imbecil amount scientific training knows qualify different vaccines certain accordance contract. administered exactly way Lancet study. modes transportation storage. 

Slovakia country broken government political turmoil one violated contract using labs outside network agreed contract, EU certified labs. even bother explain vaccine different, everyone would laugh them. Slovak vice prime minister RDIF chief phone call yesterday Slovaks still intend use Sputnik V, Russians demanded return vaccine rightly so. Unacceptable smear. need EU later agree Russia sanctions million ways US tries flex soft power Europe, might remember 2021 Russians gave vaccine unconditionally US lol
 Again, great domestic policy, I'm saying undermines White Houses foreign policy goals worry ordered 20 million doses Pfizer vaccine December. 

Only 8 months! Look WTO blocking TRIPS waivers. Manufacture around world massively delayed relation first world nations trying protect domestic pharmaceutical industries preserve political illusion they’re great job vaccinating voters shitting bed utterly handling pandemic first 12 months.

I’m sure America reached full population vaccination y’all get chill export. wonder many non Americans die political theatre refusing trips waivers allow start local manufacture months earlier? garbage topic. course higher, California people Canada. seems like low effort attempt shitting America. now. outbreak AU new variant could pretty deadly. Worse yet Biden fully endorsed little act choose working home getting vaccinated. would tough. many parts densely populated underdeveloped countries, daily struggle basic necessities like running water food outstrip damage Covid.

The leaders take advantage drugging under-privileged hollow populism strong man posturing. Remember said like 5 cases covid wasn’t serious? 😂 Yes! Especially nations (China/Russia) donating vaccines. 

So white house one hand saying ""This post-Trump era! return US dependability back! Count us allies partners!"" hand maintains vaccine export ban.

So Europe, EU super aggressive buying vaccines assumed would possible import them, feels hypocritical.

Not mention US overseas interests maintaining relationships soft power many developing nations stray away country export vaccines ones did. 

Again, policy good domestically US might pay road. undermines lot White Houses foreign policy goals Northern California here. Today day 384 kids, ages 10 5, seen inside classroom. It’s truly tragic. mean you’re wrong, it’s late better. federal government expects get 2021, 70.5m (or 73.5m AZ rather assume lower estimate) doses Q2 10.1m J&amp;J need one dose. 

We population ~84m ~15m age 16 69m left considering already administered 19.9m doses Q1 add Covidiots want get vaccinated looks likely everyone wants get vaccinated able end July. mean plenty news articles floating around vaccines worked timeline would look like. Many medical profession even gave insight rough timelines it’s crazy think happened time. 

2021 always reasonable estimate, *maybe* 2022 latest. Based people seem think massive production capacity materialize overnight think misestimation reality bigger issue Obesity usually correlates higher sugar intake lead diabetes. won’t good time COVID. Yeah whole point open soon case numbers explode, especially since last lockdown bet ass, one care social distancing. 

There currently still many vulnerable people don’t enough protection yet. makes sense wait weeks &amp; make sure don’t deal overstretched ICUs lockdowns ever again. 

Sure you’re entitled opinions you’re really expert it. mum works nurse deal new tsunami patients open quickly. It’s easy say “LeT’s OpEn uP” I’m guessing don’t work hospital aren’t faced consequences. fact old dirt, but: people also get immunity contracting virus surviving.

Given spread rate, places hitting herd immunity soon. Sweden already did, see figures: hospitalizations deaths countries given doses US. NO! amazing vaccine smear. demanding Slovaks send sample EU certified lab clear reputation. Australia certain won't. hedged bets AZ vaccine even process making millions vaccines locally. News today '50s get AZ wait another vaccine. that, best part year away getting vaccines Pfizer.

Ho-hum. Sad day Australian least travel New Zealand back week. Might fact hogging vaccine didn’t invent first place. care EU we're fighting home? absolutely agree helping Canada Mexico neigbors get population sorted EU deal own. problem whatsoever. cranking what? Canada little/no local novel vaccine mass production capacity. reliant orders nations prioritize citizens first.

Wasn't Canada self righteously saying would able provide also give vaccines poorer countries?

I believe right vaccine came out. Copy-pasted another post:

They independent membership commonwealth represented UK.

They also BOT EU membership.

They governor reports British government beyond foreign policy defense. Lot appointments including judges made UK government .

None relevant. vaccination procured/sourced UK completely. akin Vatican City , get vaccination complete Italy.


This different small nations like Bhutan Seychelles Maldives still manage vaccination American really don’t know referred here. 😶 

Minnesota part two. much hate what's happening Canada - almost feel like karma cruel saw fellow Canadians Americans months ago.

It's quite amazing engaged Canadians seem US politics. never ashamed country's leadership 

Stop engaging smug arrogance political ideology reasonable critical necessary.  Americans hold bit longer

They’ve mandated AZ 50’s sure leaves rest us now.  mean considerable damage already done, especially EU. EU literally went vaccine manufacturers assumed contracts would okay America still credibility. Trump signing vaccine report ban bad Biden maintaining looks incredibly poor face, even hypocritical white house tries regain foreign soft power. 

Sure, exporting vaccines help essentially lot damage done hole gotten slightly deeper work harder. Obviously good domestic policy ceding US soft power abroad (especially developing nations approached China Russia) Many much smaller countries lost way people WW2 US, that’s weird comparison. Also US’s population like third WW2. No. Yeah, well, R&amp;D, get stuff. Tough luck.

I spicy example you. 

If women pregnant child known negatively impact society (this could example severe mental disabilities), woman face repercussions refusing get abortion? Note self: vaccines prevent deaths.  Oh weird, read Japan different kind vaccination skepticism America. guys afraid random side-effects, Japan asked Pfizer clinical trials population. guess rollout taking longer enough get OK summer olympics, things pick quickly. german blessed day! Unless manage keep ramping vaccines. 

The US mostly vaccinated months, position larger distributed vaccine globally. I’m sure 12-16, I6+ track fully authorized month. Probably immune response, Pfizer ones reaction flu shot yearly, still better alternative. knocks crap low percentage people. take tylenol advil pain? I'm trying figure people cried pain white-knuckling took something. people took something still terrible pain, that's kind scary. That's true, even added appointments easter places added night appointments, mother got vaccinated Easter Sunday. used death clock website teenager, told would die early morning squirrel steals sandwich making causes get hit car chasing onto street. really believe that? Like never history big companies hurted society.. like listening rote recitation. No, tell anyone inject anything.

Go ahead post quote, I've seen 100x. Never tell anyone anything bleach. asked question. There's big difference asking question specifically telling someone/people something. many due Trump many due Biden literally found way spin story highlighting rising disparity vaccine coverage nations two word meme phrase. Slovaks violated contract return thr vaccine. manufacturer also insisted send sample EU certified lab clear name. Seems like Slovak government made up. we'll see ""variants"" spreading. Adjusted population would 240k Norway population Germany. Pretty similar german numbers days ago. Norways vaccine supply pick sharply coming weeks like every country that's part EU's procurement program. happy got rid organic asshole. Oh yeah I'm sure Jane nursing home big money spender yeah know someone flew Canada Hawaii spring break. flew back seattle, rented car drove across border avoid hotel hotel quarantine got it! 👍 say, ""American"" claim patriot say stupid sh#t like ""masks r way liberals control u!""

Is right? seasonal Flu also liberal attack America? know, hoax? 🙄 company well known wanting save lives UK recently. people faint injection. im really hoping so! 6 days since exposure lets pray shipping one version vaccine. controversy Slovakia made manufacturer demanding return vaccine contract violations send sample EU certified lab clear reputation. truly depressing. Especially considering brilliantly Brazil handled public health world renowned HIV program.

There loads Brazilians I'm can't stop saying much hate Bolsanaro. Lockdowns ineffective clear benefit. hearing concerns, decided allow vaccine update posts now. Please mindful reposting information please avoid spamming moving forward. hope posts clog sub; however, do, may consider reinstating rule. Thank you! Nah- it’s right. 
Some companies terrible leadership responds favorably outmaneuvered. 
Client emails ghost written key employees tend wonders. Tough out. 80% people know gotten second dose came flu-like symptoms. Fever, chills, aches. 2-3 days later fine.

When get sick, body producing antibodies. want happen. actual virus, ""spiked"" portion attaches cells. Drink water, sleep, make sure fever hitting absurd highs fine. inactivated virus vaccines (dead wrong word) Sinopharm Sinovac.

The premise comment flawed. description various vaccines work found thought was, can’t imagine deal one’s mother 92 whole years. fucking punishment. ever get spread wings? Fair enough, act smug. Whoosh! get vaccine still chance could get mild case pass someone might become much sick? 
Yeah. vaccination change exposure? best time get vaccinated avoid illness always month two get exposed, since little control that, next best time always right now. fundamentally understand works NZ. choose hotel quarantine, home quarantine government group quarantine facility. electronically monitored cell signal.

That's point. choice. NZ. Australia require arrivals stay state run quarantine hotel. give people choice home, take far arrivals. done without restricting entry citizens.

No can't. thousands citizens wanting return. want couple hundred people arriving per day maximum. enforcement issue solved without restricting entry citizens. instance, fines:

You understand I'm talking about. issue people escaping quarantine. military police guards hotels, surrounded layers fencing prosecuted jailed multiple escapees. 

The quarantine failures hotel worker gets infected enters community, uninfected guest infected infected guest facility final test released community spreads it. keeps happening. new hotel security guard tested positive yesterday community symptoms 4 days tested. unmanageable. UK variant first popped up, Taiwan halved flights UK Taiwan. travelers flew UK quarantine government group quarantine facility conditions reduce risk significantly allowing citizens enter country.

This already doing. Flights already reduced extra testing introduced. required proof negative test boarding flight immediate tests arrival. still kept getting cases arriving. 

The pause flights India see ways reduce risk. come better systems, flights resume. Yeah... US alone there's 1000+ deaths Pfizer Moderna vaccinations reason everyone focusing AZ's ~100 blood clot cases. Every vaccine risk it, AZ, Pfizer, Moderna others risk low. Honestly no. ""*OK late summer, case numbers incredibly low, rising young people - virus probably go away now*"".

They expect lock again. thought 1 lockdown sufficient get rid virus forever. offensive. I'm pretty sure offensive even 90's. making statements impact behaviors hundreds millions people - yeah, there's urge pump brakes making conclusions lest get something wrong thousands people get sick die result.

But consider counterfactual well? every day/week/month take time study/replicate results, many people die would approved earlier? refreshing see reasonable comment once. Busts heart thinking kids getting killed going school. Damn. think combination impatience, people checking Covid news leaving radical voices heard brigading. mods r/CoronavirusUK apparently evidence upvotes artificially manipulated among things. probably 12-16 sub 12 likely emergency authorization still Yea feel bad :( enough reason take precautions avoid Covid. I’m fully vaccinated still careful. I'm sorry. Hopefully world comes aid soon. semiconductor equipment manufacturers (not foundries fabs) American. notable exception Tokyo Electron.  Bonus great idea likely cost effective pay sick time short term disability. Pfizer without issue. UK achieved herd immunity must pretty dam well close amount vaccinated people already covid ?  Hey all! might seem silly question, I’ve seen conflicting reports, clarity would much appreciated.

Is Johnson &amp; Johnson considered safe breastfeeding mothers?

Thanks! mean, thought process. ""If keep locking it'll disappear"" much really do

Given know exactly virus spreads (droplets exhaled person person) **lot** actually!

Social distancing, face coverings, hand washing, meeting outdoors instead indoors.

Where past year? people don’t want get vaccinated haven’t wearing masks anyway. small economy

Wat, we're literally world's Top 10 largest economies. (Exactly 10th lol) Probably like Austria New Zealand. would say Ireland UK, well internet banter exactly cordial. needle like 3/10 pain rating, I’d rather get another prick needle stub toe need car moved city...and every place needs reno. got Moderna, first shot. 

My left arm (injection site), shoulder, back, neck aching. Rest body aching bad near injection site.

Fever low level, dissipated within day.

General feeling unwell, head ache: 3 days.

Day 4, feel much better joints still aching bit. feels like getting flu vaccine.

I read informed many people second shot make really sick plan sick leave accordingly. saw grown ass, 40 something guy sneeze menu laugh ass off. People disgusting. still would prefer many places would little better hygiene pre covid though thought COVID would magically go away. person replied say ""zero"", said much, yet reply way. I’m going limb saying happened months ago. skin thing Covid. felt like fingers made sandpaper. [It's real Germany great medical experiments large swaths people. They'd get groove fine. kids, agree completely. Kids get sick, large contract COVID. It’s nice sick past year. kids preschool destined least cold cough every month October April, past year got one sinus infection, kids didn’t get sniffles. fantastic. everyone know also worried wanted safe. 

Probably people assholes though. always loud drown everyone else out. even realize eu many doses available model must've called Cassandra™ Accidentally manufacturing defective product crime. Nobody got bad shot. None laws anything charge someone with. little hypochondriac want take meds get symptoms. hope lower vaccine immune response.

wait till get symptoms like supposed then... ??  certain percentage population vaccinated time end them. Anyone else receive J&amp;J similar side effects? none all?

I truly felt awful 8-10 hours got vaccine symptoms mentioned. gotten lot better 24 hours since though. Maybe learn apply thinking annual flu shots do?

pfizer even take warp speed money evidence real life isn’t Reddit. America hate boner website robust veiny. Agreed. 10 lbs shoulder presses bicep curls, arm barely hurt afterward! long 😭 nut! crazy coconut! case fever means immune system job, there’s need reduce it.

Also, careful Tylenol dosage going keep taking it. unfortunate immediate response say two markets LA county stopped wiping carts months pandemic. That's main reason switched getting groceries delivered.  ...by shortcutting science? I've read all. stated above. Every person different. Students different. learn differently, engage differently, different interests, enjoy others might not. engaging lose others vice versa. motivates some, loses others. 
You never going motivate 100% students 100% time. simply cannot cater every child's needs hour learning every single lesson.

I agree learning needs revisited. teacher Australia, frustrates need teach curriculum set overarching teachers authority students pass exams. I'd love see different approach exams would allow teachers bit control content. even 100% control able whatever tf wanted, would still kids disengaged unmotivated. first one booked tomorrow. wonder make go way smallpox keep coming back like flu does. absolutely illogical get wrong, I'm arguing efficacy. complaint Canada EU thought rolling lockdowns would endgame. way half-assed vaccine purchases ridiculous.  ICUs largest city full they're moving patients areas province are. 

In particular anger reacted slowly icoherently. reacted earlier need harsh restrictions outbreak would bad. Instead fucked around, initially made ""shutdown"" couldnt eat outside patios shopping malls open.

Now stay-at-home order. one likes obviously anger let get point would avoidable care. Nah, fever isn’t harmful immune system (unless gets high obviously). returns you’re uncomfortable, can’t sleep it, take tylenol otherwise I’d let body it’s thing.  Warp Speed almost literal nothing vaccine creation rollout beyond pressuring FDA allow it. cool sounding name way line pockets. Hopefully see Bolsonaro lead ruin. evolve vaccine resistant variants people can't clear infection kept alive modern medicine.  Vaccine responses measured six months. last *at least* six months. not.

Edit: think Utah's did.

Edit 2: Utah's ends April 10th. Thank you! Immunizing people isn’t stopping getting sick. It’s also stopping getting others sick. Prioritizing 70-year-old shut-in whose 45-year-old daughter 16-year-old grandson visits drops groceries twice week 45-year-old 16-year-old contact anyone else doesn’t reduce hospitalizations death lifestyle disrupted (possibly 45-year-old getting COVID-19).

Disrupting transmission COVID-19 mean prioritizing vaccination people unavoidable contact people. (Unavoidable within reaches enforcement, assuming everyone follow rules. shut restaurant easier stop someone visiting friends. People need distinguish ought.) yea right bad, im crazy tired. make sound point I'm glad people actually informing stuff def think negatively now. Kinda crazy little actually knew it. 

I probably would still say people right take terms going back school likely wont case. definitely inclined take Ugh sucks :/ know exactly means unfortunately Politicians known make decisions based political considerations!

Side note, whole number needed following numbers 0. worry you. need healthy outlet get rid power fantasies heard that, can't prove otherwise. mean ""increases chance""? exposure HIV days vaccination? sounds quite hard trial due low number possible cases.

You could also ask vice-versa. downside vector vaccines potential, low risk vector damage. downside RNA vaccines take longer give protection experimental lacking long-term studies.
It's great RNA vaccines finally worked, mRNA vaccines last 30 years withdrawn due failure severe side effects.

Sometimes right wrong. Sometimes good job. sometimes, grandfather dies weeks first mRNA vaccine, took long create immunity. might survive weeks vector vaccine. probably would survived, gotten available vaccine earlier 1: eh, depends are. die covid.

You’re definitely correct. happens get variant variant? variant prime? Better keep schools closed forever stay home stay safe. booster variants? Oh better believe new variant escapes that. Impending doom! wife J&amp;J zero side effects. Moderna felt seriously fatigued 48 hours doses. Yesterday felt kind meh, thinking allergies. Today woke sore throat waining quickly slight runny nose feel fine. Probably slight slight cold. I'm supposed get 2nd Pfizer today, reschedule next week?

I'm guessing cold relatively minor mind adding side effects, I'm reading conflicting info topic online. Anyone else get 2nd vax slightly sick? They're literally first country world achieved herd immunity virus. else seen one before?  problem Sputnik yet registered EU, labs certified EU refused testing. ŠÚKL actually asked 30 certified labs whether they'll testing, already enough work registered vaccines, refuse. tests (accredited) lab Biomedicinal Research Center Slovak Academy Science.

It certainly storage form. already vaccinated (I'm assuming ever became thing vast majority would vaccinated) would care others around aren't?

Assuming \_did\_ catch someone, understand symptoms much much mild, might like cold point?

With said, agree would definitely benefit, became socially unacceptable people go public sick wearing mask (as believe case much Asia already) could also similar affect, help reducing spread flus colds. WV requirement either ""Hygiene hypothesis"" claims one reasons many allergies days unhealthy obsession cleanliness?

I wash hands bathroom visits, eating they're obviously dirty, I've never obsessed washing day touching surfaces I'm practically never sick.

I think assume cleanliness automatically better. *laughs british* Man, last week, seemed PA good reporting. Now, we're getting trickles... hope whoever dump today.

Sure, there's big population people care enough go way get it. Stage II trial shows time doses produce robust immune response. Furthermore, China mainly using Sinopharm (as opposed Coronavac Chile), study needed making conclusion. fact, study Brazilian healthcare workers shows Coronavac 50% effective 2 weeks fist dose 78% 4 weeks first dose. pardon analogy find idea trying help neighbor put house fire also running back forth trying put fire better plan.

I think analogy fits discussion necessarily, especially since countries managed vaccinate donate.

The situation would closer someone making dozen cupcakes instead eating give neighbour.

This global issue, global effort end it. Nearly 560,000 U.S. population dead. Many countries may hit target year. think learned 1940's differences production rates US Japan...

So yes theory spread it. would rather gathering 100 vaccinated people one 20 unvaccinated. 

This could justify venue increasing capacity significantly. Hold Ah damn it, got used laughing despairing US past years feeling smug country. they're kicking asses. Great turnaround, team. Let's hope follow example lessons learned mess depends. Ohio requirement, many states. looking vaccinated, hang whoever want. Period. What’s going J+J What? don’t even state emergency anymore, stopped anyone going anyways. would hardly say “suffering”. Considering packed everything months. perspective, 1.1 million nurses Germany, it'd take nurse one dose every ten days hit 100k day. 

At slow rate 4 per hour 7 hour work day, it'd take 3600 nurses, 0.3% practicing workforce, hit 100k day. point level faith American people makes think 70% vaxxed lofty goal. hope prove wrong. 

My dad pissed went got vaccinated haha. doesn’t seem understand 1. * couurrssee* people die follow hundreds thousands covid vaccine patients couple months - would shocking nobody died - correlation doesn’t equal causation, 2. potential long term negative effects vaccine almost certainly going less severe long term effects actually contracting virus. put around 90% EU UK import ca 5 million doses India (eventually) 40 million doses Biontech. 

If counting 40m Pfizer, amount India 10m 5m, 17m Moderna Switzerland... etc.

Of course, misses millions vaccines still produced domestically UK CureVac, Novavax, AZ Valneva.. Good questions, I'm little confused myself, tbh :). I'm thinking private businesses requiring vaccine passport similar way ID's required purchase alcohol / cigarettes. Certainly laminated card get scanned would alleviate tracking concerns, still understand point schools international travel fundamentally different requiring going mass gathering, outside tracking concern.

That may true, show MMR vaccination go concert. Measels order magnitude contagious COVID even need show one travel internationally. would go far say care to, see benefit showing covid vaccinated (and still big ""if"") still spread regardless I'd preferred way around: clear set export rules beginning - something like ""export countries who're currently worse"", ""have production"", similar metrics - essentially introduced export control framework later, punishing manufacturers fulfill contracts planned, fair distribution doses manufacturers behind. 

Clear rules, communicate early something good also disadvantaging citizens - think would've right way go - always, hindsight 20/20 Well shot, never even thought that... Saying BOT best misleading

How misleading 100% correct. British overseas territories part downvote accurate information. provide additional context required. employer does, too. bet they'd unironically thrilled could get hands vaccines vaccinate employees. I'm pretty sure they'd manage successfully efficiently, too. flu-shots pretty popular year get organized without hitch. also organize check-ups regularly, like eyes back. common side effects novel virus vaccines, long time since one those. likely remember receiving MMR vaccine child, rough. time inoculate prevention illness never had, immune system kinda freaks registers unknown pathogen. experience flu vaccine influenza before-- immune system recognizes without flipping out. side effects good signs generating immune response. ever receive booster, likely side effects, like flu shot. trialing booster shots variants already. Additionally states sequence ""break "" cases see new variant causing vaccinated individuals get sick. vaccines look effective variants - nothing worry right now. first something actually proud of? hell freeze over? Absolutely. many stupid political nerds thread making political dick measuring contest. one ""no shit Sherlock"" headlines. One country vaccine program full swing funding, infrastructure, logistics straight capabilities vaccinate majority citizens within shorter time frame. country depends importing vaccines wait turn things really pick up. 

Like, fucking shit one country's rates going soon overtaken other. fucking shit. means USA finally getting thing control end game sight. Canada wait turn. Stupid headline. got 2nd dose yesterday. 

Feeling good right now. Sore deltoid like first dose, maybe slightest hint sore throat. Yeah vaccines though we're definitely lot better position today creating enough cushion like stop vaccine spreading know like instead spreading five people spreads two people slow specially last stretch going hell stretch lack vaccines haphazard way distributed especially immune suppressed systems perhaps people become human Petri dishes create perfect condition virus learn enough vaccine escape become smarter better virus able learn enough vaccine strong enough completely block fire find little bit weakness escape grow immune suppressed body petri dish hell bad time everything cuz right vaccines want keep vaccines good learn escape vaccine detection become untreatable vaccine resistant thought safe headed control we've already got vaccine loosen rains last stretch f*** up. matter many people vaccinated country live vaccinated everywhere countries possible strain could emerge could real f****** killer better smarter like viruses job like one goal better virus able spread attack better virus like kind that's say like even vaccines we've made like fair one Trump's greatest accomplishments yet he's I'm probably one things able president know joke last little bit really want give past year half nothing f*** hunker year half cuz thought safe cuz vaccines country looked good vaccines obviously slowing bread running rampant f****** Brazil we're strong weakest link. I'm parked like soon f****** flights open Cancun know like people going know apparently vaccine distributions great either friend says know. Closing borders stopping travel bit pointless look like still going like we've closed borders mean borders closed means like there's still lot people flying driving mention like looked avian flu bird flu that's followed migration patterns birds matter close every airport world late we've got figure something like bars set hospitals overcrowded put secondary hospital that's like worst case scenario that's bar set like game plan that's bad plan try overwhelm hospitals. s***** plan. I'm saying like like know hospitals like yeah want happen like goal we're trying obtain like there's consensus emerging information that's coming data collected virus like new s*** comes almost every day we're learning something know first oh kids get infected darndest thing like oh yeah kids viral vectors spreaders oh way might symptoms know they're going like maybe get arm amputated worst case scenario yeah like protecting elderly children virus making litmus test what's winging we're currently playing ear f****** good way deal pandemic I'm like that's playing ears restaurant closed know wing dealing f****** Nationwide global oh gosh lot better vaccines without it. EU throwing shit UK, shocker.

Also even true. UK already making millions vaccine per week UK, AZ. 2 vaccine production facilities set UK add UK production soon. Maybe EU focus itself? Herd immunity means unvaccinated people indirectly protected virus. yeah everyone. risk significantly diminished, yes. (90%+ reduction risk infection disease) willing take small amount risk yes return normal. 

To reduce risk vaccinated, combined risk would extremely small 99%+ reduction.

I personally seen grand parents vaccinated still take basic precautions. Like hug them, still prefer outside. 

Once fully vaccinated everyone else family even worry that. ultimately going employers change people's minds, say someone fan increasing control corporations lives.

Start carrot approach. Give people paid time get vaccinated, give cash bonus so, etc.

When stops working, take stick approach. get vaccinated take rapid Covid test every day work (on nickel) prove infected today. much Finland. Here's original comment: matter look it, Sweden always ends higher population density, whether normal way, methods calculating population-weighted density. Even population-weighted density Stockholm, quite bit higher Helsinki. 50% *a lot*, 2.5 times huge, 3 times huge, even 30% would quite bit. Plenty things would suggest Sweden dense, many things suggesting Finland dense. Yeah, Brazil done bang job pandemic. Can't dispute that. hard compare countries. numbers get grimmer grimmer curiosity Pfizer delivery plan UK? 40M doses delivered?

There delivery plan, course, UK released details stock levels. state public opinion UK support policy blocking doses UK beg publicly receive doses wrapped EU flags. AZ also cut everyone's order too, stop EU. offense every single European I've met internet. Thierry Breton say EU countries better “going solo”, like others across globe?** 
Vaccine  nationalism makes sense. country self-sufficient. takes 300 ingredients produce vaccine supplies come world. massive production ramp-up phase going  through, supply chain must follow, disruption supply  chain could dramatic consequences production capacity. 
I  therefore opened dialogue American counterpart charge  industrial production issues avoid interruption  production lines, particularly filters disposable bags  vaccine substance manufactured. dialogue  solving concrete problems. 
The applies course UK. Two thirds 30 million doses administered UK citizens produced Europe. UK depends Europe second dose. 
I  commend women men working 24/7 Europe produce  vaccines fellow citizens, also rest  world.  ICU capacity higher point pandemic. Deaths going start going soon. started praying time started vaccinating, look death rate plummet. Must prayers, all, praying God really hated humans, hate quite much. feel though conversation someone done research / understand capitalism works. UK relies domestic supply imports. strange all. live globalised society international supply chains, trade commerce happening rapid pace across borders. forgot mask First talking government mandated passport all/most public activities, select businesses requiring customers employees vaccine something (some government certain things private restrictions) ?

Would opposed passport get scanned? would eliminate tracking concern. Similar drivers license, typically get scanned need show it. 

Requiring schools international travel fundamentally different requiring going mass gathering, outside tracking concern. I’m 15 moderna study area. Every location opened trial closed.

So perfectly plausible vaccinate everyone, let people let normal un-masked un-distanced lives monitor variants come focus following year's vaccination drive accordingly. Ah. see left! course would since lot money vaccines right now?

Also want create stockpiles regardless since people need get vaccinated regularly. Maybe every year every years. UK set supply chains domestically surely care EU blocks exports not.

We fucked pandemic response trump era deserve ridicule that, nailed vaccine rollout. Thought we’d get credit that, nope.

Now right back “selfish Americans” won’t send vaccines countries people like guy going “well many people died? Isn’t funny gotcha?” Read New Yorker article, explains points making.

Why? one high-profile news org wants admit they’re going dinner parties? “media class,” subset well-to-do professional class, still behaving way?

I anti-vaxxers life I'm going see get vaccinated. I'm afraid catching Covid post-vaccination, responsible safety. Fuck that. want anti-vaxxer, fine, can't stop you. get feel safe around *while also* putting elevated risk  make choices simple.

Insurance companies exclude healthcare costs concerning COVID-19 treatment products. insurance based solidarity. 

So choice free vaccin hefty bill get hospital COVID-19. Got second dose Pfizer yesterday. feel like death today People simply don’t understand exists color grey. 
While would prefer paint world either black white, reality often somewhere between. 
We would lot better people would choose single extreme view everything.

Oh hai Mark. settled law. EUA cannot enforced anyone military (and basically approved President). Currently military forcing anyone vaccinate, highly recommending.

Back then, 6 weeks everyone vaccinated.

Yes there's also (somewhat) shortage currently, that's whole story behind delays. Occasional lockdown travel restrictions awful lot neaaarer normal we've since started. humans, breast milk antibodies cannot enter bloodstream baby, stays gut. reason think would impact baby. No, TL;DW all. hope plan bring vaccine people point. shortage lipids actually UK interest export produce import Pfizer supply/demand free economy distribution good would huge gaps like EU UK. have, non economic - non economic reasons much quicker agile EU securing vaccines.

The head association represents intensive-care sector said earlier Friday situation Germany’s hospitals “really dramatic” ICU staff “deeply worried.”

Gernot Marx, president DIVI association, told ZDF 5,000 Covid-19 patients intensive care end month.

“These really high numbers really worrying beds free,” Marx said. Many staff indicated plan leave profession pandemic due pressure job, added.

“We really need hard lockdown,” Marx said. “It makes absolutely sense think opening, rather must bring infection rate down.” [2]

With 15% Germany’s 83 million people already received Covid shot, stricter curbs necessary prevent overload hospitals, Merkel argued.
Some regions failed implement restrictions agreed government, prompting threaten seize central control pandemic policy.

Germany’s Covid-19 incidence rate started climbing around middle February, though steady rise appeared checked Easter vacation.

Spahn, also called tighter lockdown restrictions, said Friday Germany able comprehensively vaccinate population mid summer. Allowing country’s health system get overloaded close achievement unreasonable, said.


“Do want test limits? want test country handle, emergency situation, intensive care units? kind thoughts those?” Spahn said.

While calling restrictions eased inoculation program ramps weather warms -- people grow increasingly weary measures place half year -- Spahn urged people hang longer.

There *are* people society locked up. They're surrounded guards cages, told they're allowed leave asked could obey that, please.

""Locked up"" honor system thing. Kids never locked up. local counties, less demand issues delivery method issues. going every night midnight refresh website get 85 year old grandmother appointment doesn’t computer. 

I helped signed well 20+ people didn’t even know able vaccinated - didn’t check assumed weren’t. 

I’ve telling friends certain sectors months able vaccinated. haven’t tried get appointment (they assumed ineligible) county announced 16+. sites packed

Could better, could far worse It’s early yet stupidest thing I’ve read Reddit today. I'm us (mexico) that's information sounds sure, afaik let clock 40h week cant claim like full time benefits no? argument kinda skewed lol. couple things keep mind:

1. vaccine passport phone, realize phone tracked wherever goes, likely it.

2. electronic vaccine passport implementations far, keep information QR code locally phone (or paper). QR code scanned verified without requiring communication network information needs recorded. know would solve this? vaccine passport. need vaccine get restaurant, bar, concert, whatever would disappear Well people comes idiots, like ratio. Germans, French, Italians example may easy time making fun hating America, population small, idiots less noticeable. see Americans fit stereotype. end game making R&lt;1 severe disease efficient robust.

This achieved improving testing, spit air toilet sensors, early treatment, vaccines, hygiene, likely combination. Add rural situation Mississippi. Many places drive 30min hour get hospital. enough outreach smaller communities usually older, poorer less opportunity get hospital vaccine site.

Mississippian here, sure political landscape perfect conspiracy thanks decades shitty education practices, economic outlook state also major factor too. person shooting shots.

Just 15 seats shot. Canada’s borders closed Summer 2020, mostly everything else open w/ limited capacity.  Movie theatres, restaurants Bars (but dancing) etc open.  positivity rate throughout summer
Months rained 1%. aware UK secrecy delivery vaccines. European countries US giving information publicly. Actually plenty us did. oddly enough Feds thing Americans. one State’s PPE supplies hijacked Feds. Except ignoring infection/death rate is/was highest world. helping world vaccinating ourselves. little COVID.

This LOT Covid, specifically, unless want ignore science, facts data. Ill take canada thanks! Lol. Sad politicized vaccinations ridiculous misinformation spread anti vaxxers.  Almost entirely ignorant history human vaccination efforts important been.. thing, would argue, hard lockdown currently required, northern bundesland presidents dragging feet, system decentralisation government imposed WW2.

It's even required states shut time. Humans like complain... guns

Brilliant idea! Start giving every American free gun vaccine shot! Tl;dr:

-Overall efficacy 56.5%

-Efficacy one dose 3%

-Efficacy two weeks receiving second dose 27.7%

-93% people vaccinated Chile received vaccine. many people first dose

This exactly recommending, known 1st dose confers 80% actual immunity, severity hope supply exceeds demand

It does, nobody expected smany refuse. Why?

Because buy enough! Obviously?! Poverty level minimum wage really related. Full time (40 hours week, 50 weeks) minimum wage less poverty level. hope keep up. popped r/Germany see locals saying, optimistic. Plenty stories people told they're eligible, wait months doctors actually supply. lot people also said doctors received one vial office. Germans confirm this? reflection world live in, polarization, politics, media, social media, etc. also wakeup call future sort societal ""we're boat together"" situation future may harder harder tackle.

America always bastion reactionary anti-vax thought. previous deadly epidemics like smallpox polio herd immunity coerced vaccine Michael Willrich planning write book civil liberties aftermath Sept. 11 stumbled across article New York Times archives. 1901 smallpox vaccination raid New York — 250 men arrived Little Italy tenement house middle night set vaccinating everyone could find.  Venn diagram people use ""asshat"" unironically vs people nooobody nerds want hang perfect circle 100% Population 65 already around 76% first dose &amp; 58% full dose. Looks promising. Ya, precedent anti science hygenie theatre. Surface transmission remotely common ailments incredibly low. That’s reality. Yes feels good wipe things helathwise doesn’t much anything country... ie place pay taxes. Whatever country is. countries fault taking care countries. That's point.

Btw... free market playing here. paid, advance, doses. cheaper, IE profitable!, companies ship products closer manufacturing location away.

I believe Americans skip head line. way. pay use internal manufacturing get us this. like import items China. held prices offer. supply demand holding.

How world Americans, paying money, using companies run manufacturing US nationalism? want vaccine ship abroad!?!? Wut?? vaccine? one? why? got Pfizer's like December (in healthcare.) sore arm maybe day that's it. Canada think Amazing happens adults charge guys also crushing vaccines. 

I think like 46% population received least one dose. 

Other countries lockdown aren’t crushing virus like guys. Brazil, Chile Uruguay recall widely vaccinating Sinovac. daily numbers new cases going there... check [bloomberg vaccine see vaccination effort good numbers, vaccine task. Israel mean really need vaccinate half population reach herd immunity least + recovered patients? (Although kinda wish could forget ""herd immunity"" feels like impossible goal also encouraged insanely stupid behavior wrt hygiene) time statistically independent. would mean every time touch surface new 10k M&amp;M bowl one bad piece take one. I've read Monday day we'll technically accheive it. Go Germany! Everyone 16+ wants vaccine gotten then. gotten it, vast majority fully vaccinated ones wont be, beyond 2 weeks protection first shot.

So question is: plan keeping kids locked kids get vaccine Here’s deal. family. listen struggle breathe trying short conversation. Say want family time felt like death sentence. hope would come okay we’ve also lost family members friends covid. don’t take covid lightly. taken seriously since March last year. ah yes, ""educated,"" come differing conclusions soulless monsters! restaurants causing massive disease spread precocious would know it. It’s hygenie theatre covid well mostly it’s like really want travel COVID-ravaged places right now.

And leave - it’s hard expensive come back. Can’t wait check Jackson Variant 18 months. That's question. vast majority road freight comes Kent. would taken eastern European trucker pass someone ferry could well home country entirety contagious period. think shortsided call vaccine hesitant people ""antivaxxers"". makes lot people hard, feels good, get it. problem we're facing far complicated definition say 5 years ago. know number exactly, large chunk hesitant every possible vaccine sun. educated, believe science, etc. **specifically** terrified **this** vaccine. cannot attributed simple ""lol antivax moron"". reflection world live in, polarization, politics, media, social media, etc. also wakeup call future sort societal ""we're boat together"" situation future may harder harder tackle. France like anti vax compared say UK etc looking polls. think it'll especially hard France spoiler alert - demand keeping US stupid wealthy. Stupidly wealthy lol. Still feel like taking worlds doses first doesn’t feel quite right. seen 2 people close go (isolation) different stages life. ever want vent, I’ll listen. need talk, share experiences. I'm guy thinks flu symptoms 48 hours better dying COVID. work restaurant chef. We’ve masked followed everything. It’s businesses it’s customers

We’ve people come screw-in servers wearing gloves setting restaurants outside chairs morning first shot Pfizer vaccine basically 0% effective first day 90% 28 days. reported ""50% effective first shot"".

This like saying team started game 0 points finished game 24 points scored average 12 points. make sense. give sessions top getting back school... say this. hope tbh they'll probably need alot serious messaging campaigns convince citizens take jab Yeah feel like CDCs talk abiding rules cautious, comes far effective measure Covid, haven’t pushing everything they’ve got. Like maybe they’re putting effort vaccinate people they’re sure hell get people want get vaccinated move us back normal life without Covid worry. Every time see anything effect “get vaccinated you’re idiot” makes mad exact thing failed terms masks. doesn’t make people want wear more, makes mad. Pretty soon going teen house.

It’s nice stuff semi-clean store now. really hope too, seeing people quietly change stance actually go heartening. mention many people swayed able participate normal life vaccine passport whatever vs ...not. least outside communities precautions required observed. want fly need vaccinated they’ll probably quietly get jabs. death bad thing world? 

This true now. COVID survivors documented lasting health issues inevitably decrease life expectancy. 

Prioritizing old people, don’t live high exposure lifestyles first place, allows variants. required predetermined weaker versions. current dominant virus us uk variant. 

If past truly prologue, 2020 would looked lot like previous years. tell something could happen 2021. Finally! It’s complete falsehood people conflate following restrictions anti vaccine sentiment. Many people think covid isn’t harmful enough justify massive life alterations, many people still want vaccine - insurance providers businesses lots say going forward Preach. number matters vaccines 99+% effective preventing death hospitalization. Yesterday half million vaccines. 

And people vaccine wanted (over 50s younger at-risk health conditions) represent 99% deaths. 

And minimum, second doses mimic rate first doses. 75% adult population would put us 200m.

Thats 60% overall population.

Higher numbers Israel currently (~56%), believe herd immunity cases surging much? You’d think winter would worst numbers considering people insure more. ""normal "" disaster inept unprepared covid bring world's population knees. US spent 6 months blocking ip rights vaccines India South Africa. matter make vaccines one else  average person Norway cares PM does? people know busy. sure mean lawsuits employers set rule want employment ""at "" states insurers major play going forward 70's advertising [Magic ""back massages""... crazy year, cut lethality disease least half, more. ‘Germany stands side more’

Nice lmao  Therefore everyone, including myself, using adjusted figures - see comment above. DE vaccinated 650K people, equivalent would 130K NL. actual vaccinations 40-50 daily basis.  - actually, employer require ANYTHING ""at will"" states employer offers health insurance insurers input 100%
 - one well many people know taking lot stuff consideration concerning businesses COVID policies staff well customers. think so, example CVS sign-up form asks need first second shot. presumably could schedule separately.

I got first shot 3/31 told I'm eligible 2nd shot 17 days later scheduled 4/22. thinking trying get appointment 4/17 2nd shot swing it. even better news UK source of, obviously, UK variant

That's factually incorrect. UK may first place 'UK' variant first found, evidence variant originated there, UK tests/tested samples countries found quicker. Yeah trump administration really aggressive securing vaccines, Israel government uk boris. reading article recently comparing states two well getting vaccines compared Europe. Big part waiving responsibility vax makers understanding... nations would not. This. New York could use supply. “Last 20 years? like invasion Afghanistan Iraq? US export vaccines Canada Canadians like Iraq war...you think that's serious argument?”

LOL, said that? bring Iraq war? say “20+ years” that’s experience with, many years sentiment same: “The US business Vietnam”, “The US shouldn’t Korea”. sentiment resounded decades, statement still stands. 

Canada free support development vaccine manufacturing facilities pay costs maintaining presence within borders part national defense. lack facilities US’s doing, government’s careful calculus wouldn’t necessary. Perhaps lobby additional manufacturing facilities Canada? 

I wonder would Canada’s response country contained manufacturing facilities? Send everyone else around world first? likely not. probably would US, always try take care closely identify with, carryover communal tribalism likely, see others assisted “before we’ve helped own” something resonates people every nation. 

I won’t say “fuck em”, want get everyone quickly possible, government responsibility citizens first. link?

Yeah estimated fatality rate falling throughout pandemic. started 3-5% seen reports 0.25%. Part treatments better think part also understanding many people ever thought. 

Then consider 80-90% fatalities 15% population, people vaccinated. fatalities fall 80-90% now, puts fatality rate flu viruses. country country gonna fine? I'm even Canadian...

As history Canada losing vaccine production capability, actually never problem now. west largely let free-market organize efficient way possible. Canada never short vaccines prior moment.

The shortages come result everyone playing free-market rules going good, playing nationalist rules going gets tough.

Forcing every individual country world build vaccine production capabilities, face suffering shortages, inefficient way organize vaccine production. worse, utterly unnecessary, maintained open free exchange goods.

Now obviously US export vaccines met full internal demand, that's exactly impressive. country/system world would produce vaccines needed refuse export them?

The whole point Canadians also paid vaccines tax dollars, US government refusing let companies honor contracts blocking exports. like US paying Canada get vaccines.

Americans paid them. Canadians paid them. one group claiming output first. limited supply, means benefiting one group, expense other. case, Americans Canadians.

Now position Americans, virtue Americans, deserve skip ahead line, that's fine. choose believe that. USA #1, fine. let's pretend anything that, basic nationalism. Yup. 10% mortality. age gender. got mine yesterday around 3 pm, woke minor head/bodyaches 3 am, took excedrin fine since then. However aches rare end week work desk job. 

No fever anything yet, still hours go hit 24 hour mark here's hoping get rekd 3 pm.  already said thats well proportion. netherlands fair bit smaller germany population wise still decent sized nation. Wasn’t insult, observation. “It affects people” logic pandemic deniers using justify ignoring pandemic altogether. flawed argument it’s flawed argument now. People abroad call ""Trump tropics"" reason... uses tactics staying offensive things, denying calling media fake news saying stupid things online. Although Facebook live transmissions Twitter. RI either, think requirement RI work got first Moderna shot haven’t felt different. second one hit harder? time thought us Canada right. Ontario stay home order another month.

Turns US handled things better. Yup, sars1 contagious symptom onset.  slightly different sars1 would sars cov2 worse. pile things.

no coherent response federal government provinces. 

bad direction federal health early on: wear masks; lets pursue china relationship vaccine (this truly WTF); allow air travel block border traffic; overly optimistic forecasts vaccine delivery.

bad provincial response. earlier right, third lockdown probably little late (when known better), particularly BC Ontario. 

fatigue setting big time. US varied 'head sand happening' life continues normal, canada social distancing mode / lockdowns year. beginning major wear people, financials stretched limit.

we also bad luck. domestic vaccine production, companies involved (mainly Glaxo Smith-Klein) formula. we're dependent upon imports.

we also Trudeau posturing vaccines know with, shifting blame provinces, provincines shitting trudeau slow vaccine delivery.

good news we're close... finally getting hundreds thousands doses week, we're months behind US. Yep sounds like ""my shot better shot"". Tell fuck himself. fine. However shouldn’t stay lockdown 25% don’t want it. own. If/as antibodies catching COVID fade away , people may want consider getting vaccination. don’t think may never need one, knows sure point, that’s it’s novel virus (with variants). can, KY center good appointment time me. went back home turned away KY started looking appointment availability OH IN, state residency requirement. Poor big Pharma needed billions staring investment shapes biggest vaccine deal human history? Come fuck man.

It's like ordering millions dioses donating money big pharma. order need deliver.

But expecting increase production capacity big time without binding orders? Come man, grow up. That's economy works. this..:/ Totally fair assessment. pause around potential lingering symptoms, would greater impact course lifetime child 80 year old given expected years live. honestly seen anything concrete respect frequency effects happening children long linger can't say one way another that's something seriously consider.  desperate don’t think so? sell things help prevent spread though- think like masks genitals! That's true, i'm thinking longer term hospitals overwhelmed able procedures, still getting covid patients would gotten hospital. Plus amount money subsidized government covid. 

 [Some America’s wealthiest hospital systems recorded healthy surpluses, thanks federal bailouts - Washington

That's 30'ish people ranging Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, Nevada, California. may 

And family, mostly Republicans can't stand Trump, they're mostly vaccinated, reluctant. abstaining said they'd get vaccine requirement travel, is, they'll wait see. 

I'm happy received 2nd Pfizer dose last week. crazy fat, lying, sack shit charge accomplish. use word ""maximum"" ridiculous inconsistent rest message. could ""maximum"" suppression mean anything short Hubei-style lockdown? they're actually calling that; want masks, distancing, ventilation, sequencing variants... perfectly mainstream measures places ostensibly trying already. word ""maximum"", see everyone's attacking article. allowed refuse vaccination pandemic- absolutely segregated rest society choosing option. Unvaccinated people could safely vaccinated create dangerous situation living immunocompromising medical conditions well others can’t get vaccinated (including children). Really also expected pay massive cost continuing pandemic, entirely preventable everyone get vaccinated so. 

The freedom choice isn’t freedom responsibility... don’t right make choices impact everyone else without limiting impact others. weren’t dealing highly contagious virus continues significantly disrupt life world, might feel differently. since facing pandemic, need either get vaccinated separated society completely. really look If/when CDC says ok vaccinated go without mask, fascinating see many people still wear them. suspect lot people become easy way tell us vs them. don’t epidemiology much strong reading comprehension. conclusion paper linked:

The failure public leaders take adequate steps prevent viral transmission made nation vulnerable, allowing COVID-19 become leading cause death United States, particularly among aged 35 years older. Much escalation preventable, true many deaths come. prospect vaccine offers hope 2021, solution come soon enough avoid catastrophic increases COVID-19–related hospitalizations deaths. need entire population take disease seriously—notably wear masks maintain social distance—could urgent. local coronavirus subs becoming “stay inside always” getting ridiculous mine? don’t understand reach people give good guidance. generally agree. thing pause little people variety reasons able get vaccine work well them. 

My hope enough people get vaccinated non-issue though. confident safe effective long term

We can't confident true long-term data (multiple years), exist yet. vaccines even technically approved like vaccines current use emergency waivers public health institutions lot people fear understand

People understand testing approval process expedited emergency reasons, full testing observation occurred, like currently available vaccines. cornball That’s wonderful news! too, think clear best option. I'm saying think pass judgement try understand they're coming exercise compassion. imagine lived relative isolation access information experts lied experimented people past may feel differently right too. trust experts said so, trust experts familiar science trustworthy people personal lives do. feel same. frustrating thing 15 month old son since can't get vaccinated family careful about. chronic salmonella currently (seeing specialists) unsure covid infection could point. weird time baby...I also live Florida infections going stores filled non mask wearers so. two cents. think would sadly reinforce ignorance. like, “see right didn’t need vaccine!” reality everyone shielding getting it. well! awake last evening. boss currently family everyone high spirits don’t know risk levels are, I’m going even make number up. situation basically nothing, we’re letting virus reach small number children young adults could severe reaction. they’re running trials children eventually plan approve vaccine children roll them.

As far risk death less flu kids, I’ve heard pandemic long, actual proof that? We’ve told every scientific source covid deadly flu, know there’s mass misinformation there. take claims seem contradict public health officials telling us grain salt. Never said were. blocking 99% world entering back normal either. Canadian here, fly real quick get jab? live Kentucky help vaccine website said vaccine appointments available last week. went walgreens's website plenty appointments available. got vaccine Friday, I'm happy. news article medical site sources... I'm sure mean that... Surely metric efficiency could percentage population vaccinated? speed vaccine injected someone's arm delivered? think quite easy see that, unfortunately, countries better others... Indiana opened state, don’t mind drive. heard plenty open slots around Peoli. Wait what?? getting from?

Lockdowns always used control spread present, never single bit government communication come suggested long term fix anything. always communicated short term control spread.

And vaccines literally ALWAYS part strategy. purchased shit ton vaccines multiple vendors fairly early. problem course since can't manufacture own, USA exporting, difficult actually get vaccines purchased. never case ""hurr durr lockdowns magically make go away"".  see I'd argue death count useful metric dealing countries (relatively) tiny population translate well scale.  

Additionally, United States large country geographicall, different climates people located urban rural areas.  get diversity countries necessarily. Dude... Canadians wildly distort everything comes America sort threat insult. Trump never said Canadians national security threat. guys believe that, says ignorance anything. 

Trump said domestic steel production matter national security, critical material war time machines infrastructure, cheap sources foreign steel pose threat viability domestic steel manufacturers. One sources include Canada. pretty boring, tame statement. 

Canadians highly protective industries. Canadian media calling vaccine manufacturing capabilities matter national security. mean Americans threat national security?

No, obtuse children deliberately interpret everything neighbor says negative way possible We’re glad Texas moved past “FEMA Morgue Trailers” phase pandemic.  cities holding strong keeping mask mandates, finally saving parents’/grandparents’ lives. keep weeks, might able avoid 4th wave hitting prematurely relaxed states Midwest. agree, vaccine authorized emergency use. fully approved like vaccines. entire country like half population California. wont take long vaccinate y'all. fine. First, said leading state, 100% accurate. Early vaccine distribution, absolutely one leaders terms distributing supply given, along states like West Virginia. Additionally one first states vaccinate teachers. states caught passed us terms % population vaccinated, mean one best administering vaccine.

Which leads second point, numbers accurate not. currently administered 79% first dose shots, get vaccine Tuesdays percentage drops moves back week goes on. follow data see end Monday, 4/5 administered 89% first dose vaccine we've given. again, would likely 90%, Spring Break likely brought numbers down.

Currently, we've administered 1,510,082 first doses 18+ population around 3,000,000, right around 50% adult population receiving one dose. Considering yesterday, 42.4% adults entire US gotten one dose, I'd say Kentucky still one leaders statistic. ripping mask **while actively Covid positive**? leadership lose, strong institutions Brazil decides doesn’t want leave? fucking competition America, everything requires first want keep going way get reminded always first worst ways possible. since mid jan Boulder one liberal counties one liberal states. [21% eligible got least one shot. It’s sad true flexes needed. Yup.

Even idiots take it, vaccines make next impossible virus spread vaccinated heard. Anti-vaxxers still benefit vaccines. serious? interview two Americans British professor wrote book, “ “No Thing Free Gift: Gates Foundation Price Philanthropy.” Russians involved. linked podcast people won’t read book, you’re certainly welcome helps benefits rich risk children low though even unvaccinated children may lower risk millions vaccinated adults. 

80 year olds hundreds times risk death young children vaccination. Even vaccine 99% effective reducing death would still much higher risk. ignoring fact told people inject bleach? selectively remembering things Hard science wannabees (who publish papers reproducible controls) extrapolated quite much long term effects kids be, guessing. seen before. bet kids catch course months. bet better mine, even informed rafts peer reviewed studies rats, monkeys rich kids psych experiments Columbia. yep. Sinovac today better Pfizer year.  Fucking hell.

For real though feels good almost done this. feel good amount protection first dose already. Well they're sort thing covid they? people die conditions made worse covid still getting counted covid deaths? people start realize want leave country need vaccinated numbers change. Bro don’t energy. Best luck life. Time, convenience, passive peer pressure cut number half. already shrunken significantly couple months ago. stupid articles statements pitting people other. normal people nothing vaccine production, can't claim we're better one another it. We're mercy country's politics economics. want shite. 
Can't politicians get it. 

There's much resentment built sides completely unnecessary. felt get sucked defensive UK I'm sick it. Remainer loved visiting countries EU. really hope visit without feeling like people hate I'm British, Brexit vaccine nationalism :( Yup. [According Daily Beast least I've trying hard get vaccinated, everything booked knows long. definitely qualify too. quite interesting. understood article correctly, could alternative vaccine option interested current vaccines available religious reasons (e.g., use stem cells past abortions). I, one, plan get one current vaccines available, religious peers family members expressed concerns current vaccines reason. concern though trial control group - research-inclined thoughts might mean terms possible biased results, would appreciate it. Oh sure, I’d imagine countries underreported numbers everybody goes get tested. flip side, there’s many cases deaths reported covid deaths probably shouldn’t be. 

At end day, find really hard believe country like India low numbers (relative population), due insanely dense impoverished areas located country. manage well? understand? preoccupied symptom happen like may think means Vax working. Actually I'd love that. want prevent getting getting vaccine unfortunately us lay bed day, may well house catch fire happens. worried could lower vaccine efficiency tool ibuprofen right getting shot purpose first dose. 

I got answer others see need shame issues, delete comments due disgusting replies getting death COUNT worst I'd argue death count useful gaging severity. talking deaths per capita becouse think far important measure trying compare counties response, becouse that'd tell likely person country die covid

One common topics conversation country right people trading tips info states vaccinating anyone everyone 16 regardless citizenship. People setting appointments abroad willing pay two trips get doses. Granted, it’s minority means this, contributes boosting vaccinated population frees local dose supply. risk unvaccinated children likely lower vaccinated 70 year olds though. children still risk mean 70 year olds continue follow restrictions even vaccinated? 


Also children risk death actually lower flu. Hope herd immunity risk, think 75%-25% takes children account. sure expect start vaccinating 16. vaccine available everyone 16+ month two, time reopen everything.

Anyone refuses vaccine point. 

This currently see situation, i'm open anyone pointing potential flaws plan. absolutely moronic statement. selfless noble country call home?

Don’t get vaccinated whatever least don’t care potentially spreading someone elderly immunocompromised might take vaccine shot. great title tbh, author considers number possible approaches whilst concluding recommend put efforts vaccinating everyone possibly can, particularly vulnerable individuals communities.

It *literally*  Rural areas less people people contact indoors. lot people living countryside feel like need it. Yeah little confused point made it’s true. Efficacy Pfizer neck neck placebo day 12. 

And frank, that’s interim P3 data, would argue could easily said Pfizer 100% advertised effectiveness right 2nd week. Even CDC’s study hospital workers incomplete best guess based population constantly tested hitting asymptomatic positives. current number 18 rare clots 35,000,000 people globally received it. That's 1:2,000,000 chance getting assuming 100% vaccine none naturally occurring. put perspective, 1:2,320,000 Americans killed lightening. think so, easy scale. think winner mRNA normal fridge storage temperatures. Bruh... makes think world gone safe manageable hellscape? words one Bruce Willis, Welcome party pal! Nobody reads headlines articles anymore, guess. shouldn’t surprised. teach high school lol. Skepticism cynicism

A skeptic someone demands evidence update understanding world develops views accordingly. cynic someone rejects value evidence maintain predetermined misanthropic worldview.

It foolish suggest masks lack evidence they’d help. stupid take “no evidence they’ll help” determine “it incontrovertible cannot help.” New evidence leads new conclusions among sane literal definition EU leaders. great news. Even 20% vaccination severely slow pandemic. get 40%, over. course aim 100%. Raw numbers meaningless. smaller countries many vaccines US, could vaccinate entire eligible populations, nobody else many. Even still, unless huge total today, trajectory flat last week; upswing. Look 7-day average. countered anecdote another. Maybe couldn’t fill appointments, scheduled working day. 

I guess wait 2 months see vaccinations either max tail another level.

Saying 99% people “have excuse” bullshit though, point making things up. 72 hours post 2nd Pfizer dose started wearing mask walking *in parking lot store*. looks get people priceless... Moderna It’s feel sort self shame waiting, never got would first line get, I’m 30 finally opened state. don’t want deathly ill first infection far that. sucks. vaccine get? absolute stupidity youth sports right blows mind woohoo ! 🥺❤️ hope future vaccines produced without involvement.

Pfizer 15% Moderna both.  “It’s 100% effective” take deaths divided population get per capita, ratio expressed decimal. 
Also I'm still confused hell arguing, becouse talking USA worst death count, said death count useful measurement death per capita useful, said death count useful, asked diffent said, said death per capita useful confused hell arguing Turns ivermectin “not afraid” don’t stop covid. addition, 20% admitted hospital ICU need mechanical ventilation support maintain breathing, data 10% children teens infected coronavirus require hospitalization, analysis suggests go develop severe children develop serious illness leads hospitalization, use invasive mechanical ventilation death,"" researchers U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention wrote.

For 99% people, find hour get vaccine. I’m sorry brother law, believe people whose situations allow easily this, FAR norm.

Initially, Continental Army banned practice mild illness followed, certain, people die British Army higher natural immunity smallpox far exposed it. greater immunity, Washington feared could deciding factor CDC tracker always day behind. April 8th posts, higher April 1st (the comparable day). highest number cases reported single day since February. 

Comparing April 7th April 1st disingenuous since different days week. thought too. 

Also, death rate whole population 0.8% annually, 144,000 health workers died reason last year? means despite front lines, covid responsible least 2.5% deaths last year health care workers. probably higher all-cause proportion weighs heavily retired individuals. Well, that's depressing. Children absolutely vaccinated they’re allowed to, risk COVID children comparable risk flu. say, adults chance fully vaccinated US, reason restrictions lives remain.

TLDR: ""We'll open border give us surplus"" started badly looks like end better first Pfizer dose arm hurt slightly it. Flu shot year worse me! Even worse read history eradicated US didn’t even pull heavyweight USSR work honestly US brought wouldn’t block efforts eradicate it.  virus apolitical.  single person hustle get shot doesn’t mean everyone same.

Safety Protocols Line-ups officially publicized yet.  Pfizer totally agree flu shot year worse me! means it’s still going fester give rise variants. variants survive virulent. may even evade vaccine target.

This exact statement could said nearly anything vaccinate -- whooping cough, polio, mumps, measles, yellow fever, smallpox, etc. endemic huge chunks population much, much time mutate virulent evade vaccines. haven't. makes think coronavirus going things?

We 70 years ago.. 6 million nyc smallpox There's still reason expect pace Wednesday Thursday continue immediately. Thursday, general practitioners accounted 325k ~800k vaccines. However, allocated million shots per week.

On hand, bright side course seems like there's lot potential GPs increase numbers.

With 60 70 million vaccine dose deliveries expected Q2, would least keep pace last couple days want use almost doses quarter. I'm endorsing death count per capita like loses meaning scale due country characteristics. excuse use kids vaccinated? think part opposition fear restrictions would keep getting extended (into planting season).  know quite Republicans getting shot now.. becomes norm versus outliers, see many quietly going get (mostly higher risk factors).  Sounds like common sense me. Wearing mask keeping social distance mitigates transmission respiratory disease, somebody would told folks year ago.  BAD GIRL! overwhelming majority epi's agree unlikely see variant escapes vaccine induced protection.

We always fear unknown that, unknown, reasonable fear variants escaping vaccines. USA! Hopefully things continue settle down.

And safe there! remember seeing busy fueling back ramp job. :) locking unused doses 60 65% state require states county. 

States like Alabama Mississippi tens thousands openings going unused. seems like stats 75% doses used always second doses stored certain percentage logistic pipeline, getting low 60s bad. Michigan getting doses people's arms, going preferable giving Alabama another 1-3% sit shelf. AIDS knows source. that’s thing Yeah mean hope realize - living modern day WW2 moon landing. natural world (or reckless negligence) necessitating scientific solution problem. USA stepping solve problem anywhere else world Derek Lowe awesome Came ask question. 

I'd guess moderately less? still Phase 3 clinical trial, rigorous data analysis implies. trial smaller. Also part EUA looking vaccine could made scale quality produced trials. manufacturing quality analysis part much shorter since came right existing assembly line. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Good luck enforcing they’re kept sealed required temperature, vaccines stable quite long time. they’re taken temperature condition, like vials prepared injections, freezer failure, that’s doses need immediately used. Idk bought 4 Xbox’s Yeah thats likely explanation. Unfortunately ,this might suggest covishield (Indian name astrazeneca) vaccine, chance becoming inoculated carrier relatively high. However, already knew problem, might applicable outside hospital environments. Given viral load much higher environments, wouldnt huge surprise. Anecdotally, usually worst night day after, people feel mostly better day that. say were, deliberately obtuse? know said that, told multiple people figures include even though they're primate care providers time. dense? Per CDC guidelines, test positive COVID-19 quarantine reschedule. tested negative COVID-19, try contacting vaccination site -- may ask reschedule avoid getting anyone else sick. Congratulations! explicitly vaccine related information variants impact (if any) rates long covid? doubt we’ll really stop using them. equivalent commercials listing rare side effects including death everyone keeps taking medicines anyways. One million chance isn’t worth getting Covid over. Even you’re young. hospital all, Intensive Care Unit. Southern California hardest hit. hospitalized discharged, hopefully. Deaths continue trend here.

Also millions people too. City Los Angeles alone 4 million people. Michigan? Yes 450M. 900M x2 = 1.8 billions.

2 doses EU population = 900M. twice Eu population 1.8b eastern state Odisha closed 700 vaccination centers earlier week said supplies available two days' worth shots remaining facilities. Shortly midnight Thursday, municipal official Mumbai tweeted list city's vaccination centers 99 marked red indicating would closed next day. Migrant laborers reportedly packing trains buses try leave big cities native villages ahead possible local lockdowns. reception office hasn’t improved. 😑 lockdowns become way broad term.

Shelter place orders work well broad buy public. problem time one, buy decreased. one though, credible say last, however. mean want impose population. People making decisions body aren’t imposing anybody. Y’all blindly follow political heroes dystopian nightmare. Pennsylvania's governor tweeted everyone wants vaccine least first dose mid may.

Out abundance caution asked filling position local.
That lovely southern lady told me, flat out, lot locals even read.
I wonder anything low vaccination rate confirm. number Europeans can't tell difference tabloid headlines reality rather disturbing. Hold on, stopped social life pandemic? That's old conservative family members behaved.

Edit: Kudos though :) education tools prevent this. chose to. least US would illegal ask anyone reveal private medical history civil acts like going school getting jobs. Heck illegal states even ask job candidate age, marital status, whether kids.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well guess lowest denominator US gets attention. two types people avoid vaccine: ignorant, without education understand metrics numbers news internet showing vaccines dangerous. Germany twice population California, that's different might think. Yep. side note mom covid bad reaction first didn’t much reaction second  Got mine days opened 18+ least boring (summer) olympics time around. Sucks Japan though I'm sure spent loads money infrastructure going get used much. everything prevent spread? Last heard Michigan wasn’t taking precautions. odds blood clot one million. odds hospitalization, death, long term severe effects Covid much higher.  live Tampa, went Raymond james stadium got vaccine less 30 minutes, really done pretty great job making available. 

They also pop sites party districts, making convenient helps. is. hope future vaccines produced without involvement. However, consider amount disgusting vitriol British press thrown EU past weeks something entirely EU's fault, can't help feeling little bit 

Same EU leaders throwing constant undermining remarks UK's vaccine programme since approved first vaccine.  
 
The difference is, shitty tabloid headlines mean nothing. words leaders actual consequences. 
 
But sure, continue making UK somehow bullying poor, helpless block 27 countries, justifying xenophobia shitty tabloid headlines. maybe here, that's burned away good trust. i'd argue pretty sensible. sucks schools close indoor dining huge transmission risk. Get button says “fully vaccinated” Everyone thought Merck GSK/Sanofi super experienced vaccines would powerhouses classic vaccine tech newish adeno vectored super new mRNA would interesting test probably marginal contributors global vaccine pool might well work all.

Instead Merck dropped vaccine candidates low efficacy Sanofi redo trial due dosing error. “Western” vaccines highest volume Russian one using new technology. 

Very unexpected that’s value making lot different bets, could turned differently. Well said. Sometimes feel like, “America?!? Wtf!”. last couple months I’m like “America, fuck yeah!”. /u/YourWebcam cant reply post part post breaks rule ""You contribute high-quality information. require users submit reliable, fact-based information"" ? directly WaPo everything clearly sourced/detailed article.  German government invested Biontech, company could independent Pfizer EU's vaccine supply lag behind US. sign shot WA, technically eligible, still go? I've heard checking time. feel like could make sign (I answer questions would make technically eligible). There's outdoor classes? That's cool! Never heard before. would killed get fresh air stuck stuffy classroom. TIL viruses don’t spread outdoors can’t transferred person person high fiving sitting dugout together. lot inner-city youth rely scholarships keep lives track end streets

You're getting scholarships based skill. End school sports year kill chance get scholarship. suspend year. 

This business people literally feeding families.

It's totally unnecessary activity incredibly likely spread disease need be. schools places, would expected reasonable, still is, again, absolutely assinine. Holy shit. optimistic liberal, call press Reading waiting room second jab. Feels good man Yep. got mine Wednesday morning, felt fine entire workday roughly 6-8 hours later felt incredibly tired started get headache. Remained way 24 hours began feel fine again.

Completely fine now. Arm still bit sore nothing bad. I'm totally vaccinated (passed 2 week post 2nd Pfizer shot earlier week) pretty much major adverse symptoms shots. thing swelling around injection site 2nd day second shot. friends family chills, fatigue (enough need nap) brain fog. shot hurting swelling, I'd suspicious got pc chip ""vaccine"" 😁 referring don’t know... Data goes back six months pfizer moderna still showing strong antibodies six months initial trials. months go on, we’ll know more.  think issue still GDPR, least time being. We're getting way European countries much risk tolerant people sub disagree. playing indoor soccer since like mid summer. risk? Absolutely. definitely riskiest thing do. However young healthy choose accept risk. going see older family members would sit week otherwise see anyone concerned getting sick.

Controlling spread covid important maintaining much normalcy can. especially true kids hurt lockdowns despite least risk. I’m Alberta. Sorry friend. Reddit 40% American. Lots trite shit comes upvoted non-americans drive I've hearing bay area. People run every stop sign/red light nowadays. get second dose week today! excited Additional mutations found weekly Brazil. There’s chance new way life. That’s urgency comes from. That’s I’m worried about. certain point, everyone wants shot gotten it. question that’s enough people put end this, many remain unvaccinated thus letting thing continue rage likely turn something vaccine won’t help.  Sports schools, bars restaurants, seem prolonging virus open. got last one put tough unknown position, trying best world unknowns. Obviously hindsight mistakes made, expected situation like that. 

Sadly, like said, many people put politics ahead common sense attacked anyways cared exploiting pandemic score political points saving lives. pretty good idea long-term effects similar respiratory illnesses. It’s highly unlikely kid mild case COVID going wake 65 breathing issues. want stay locked kid 65 sure, you’re crazy.

Seriously—what’s alternative? Locking zero COVID, probably achievable. Ontario Outdoor compliance. Lol. live different realities. Unlike traditional vaccines, mRNA vaccine easily scaled industrially without need huge egg cultures, adjuvants, etc., associated problems. 

Once initial development cost paid (by rich countries) mRNA vaccines become lot cheaper traditional vaccines. 

CureVac already plans build mini-factories customized mRNA vaccine installed every lab hospital around world like 3D-printer produce exact quantity quality vaccines needed locally, even customized individual patients. Yes! merrier. kids 5 2 it'll bit, progress help us reach herd immunity levels since able adults alone thanks large amount anti-vaxxers there. Everyone know Canada straight worried suffering Americans, gloating anything. response prior administration trash talking

Canadians really exactly like Americans. Hooray!! Ten percent study population, ten percent kids. study population kids teens positive COVID seen hospital ER. So, ten percent kids teens seen hospital ER needed admitted hospital inpatient care related COVID. Thank You. didn’t help stubborn stupid.

I'll second this. skeptical mask effectiveness March 2020. masks principal, figured prevent infection anyways. Nevertheless, accepted mask wearing public spaces cost nothing bit discomfort. new information came supported hypothesis masks prevent transmission became proponent. I'm fucking idiot. saying Biden's using big boy stuff? one fortunate people fully vaccinated. 

It's liberating able take deep breath know going spread covid die it. back mind since started, not. 

Don't afraid get vaccine. worth it. Thank you. *Its like think shit reason.* said day thread JB potentially pro-nuclear energy. could actually accomplish leave firearms/magazines fuck alone would vote him. agree everything Dems like I'm love Republican party either... Adjusted population, stark, though Canada still better overall.

But...

Vietnam deaths *total*: 35, recent last August.

Canada fine Western country, get lot credit we're grading curve. Well they're really female genetic sequencing everyone they're testing hey f****** expensive know like Brazil variant found Brazil Japan found UK invested lot money countries South Africa well Ebola viruses emerged countries Japan UK invested lot money genetic research medical side that's variants found like costly places test phenotypes genetic sequencing like colleges universities hospital all. Thought we're testing kids everybody's got idea know kids fine they're resilient they're going affected they're exposed lot viral load longer amount previously we're seeing play infection rates thing affecting little kids like looks like joints start swelling really stiff show symptoms adult far know. mean testing different variants like going find they're know able evade vaccine response infectious find like there's lot data collected like think go like New England journal medicine read like preliminary reports stuff that's done like lab what's done lab versus real life different science journals little bit heavy-handed might actually take searching reader's part order fully understand study that's done like CEO Amazon says oh Amazon's really good trust us I'd rather little bit information CEOs word vaccine he's selling making s*** ton money on. data that's come far vaccines matter one protects severe hospitalization death there's nothing really that's come actual safety think important point make. Either i'm dumb last paragraph completely non sensical ""you could multiply population even population "" makes sense. using population death per capita find death count seeming nothing I'm talking about, becouse I'm talking death per capita useful trying judge servarty covid country Right, someone thread mentioned someone know giving credit bacon, red meat strongly associated cancer risk smoking (sorry red meat lovers) Vancouver

They look comparable Cambridge, assuming 1 1 conversion. many adults refuse it, need get kids vaccinated bring vaccinated population %.

Don't want concerned kids needing it? Blame antivaxx adults. hell y’all talking about?

Vaccines covid response.

I feel like I’m taking fucking crazy pills.

Our covid restrictions decreasing case counts increasing. Michigan experiencing new wave.

What promise Biden keep? better trump?

He restarted border wall construction.

Minimum wage isn’t changing.

He doesn’t want legalize marijuana.

Ice raids still happening.

We’re aggressive Syria.

We’re spraying herbicides coca leaves Columbia.

There’s green new deal.

There’s carbon tax.

Student debt hasn’t cancelled, single cent.

Increased aggression China.

Increased aggression India.

Increasing defense spending AGAIN.

Like come fuck on!!!! certainly doesn’t sound pleasant, estimates correct less 10k people died country wide, measures certainly fairly effective. It’s hard imagine Bangkok ghost town, though. Congratulations received second Pfizer dose two days ago! Yep, that's I've heard anecdotally well! Make sense since us who've fought already presumably stronger/quicker immune responses never exposed it. least J&amp;J ""one done""! Thanks! heard around Day 14 told this? Stop spreading misinformation. It’s usually EU got normal approval - therefore fully liable. stayed public eye, press good press. wondering, idea past onset window people expect happen going happen? seeing cases AZ 16 days highest onset symptoms. Cool...thanks info hope gets coughed lot jail. driving cars interstate banned would mandatory take airplane, lot lives could saved, since airplanes much safer.

But always question freedom. American, personally nothing make vaccine happen. benefiting it. damn special?

Well paying taxes, think money coming from? America innovate much better corporations pay taxes, Americans free health care, schooling, safety nets. least country vaccinate citizens go back working long hours afford bills. 

The government look citizens first, others second. US end providing doses country, better vaccine. Yes, personally nothing, collective, Americans bought paid vaccine, could get vaccinated. dont need full herd immunity see huge improvements. depend state live too. deep south probably get hit next thanksgiving. words, new restrictions. Nobody going follow Whitmer's recommendation pretty much going dark April. Get vaccine please. Michigan opened general population eligibility week starting become easier get appointment excuses running out. fully vaccinated, please continue stay home, mask social distance absolutely choice go out.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  today’s numbers even adressing I'm actually talking about.

Do Latvia Estonia large minority non-whites, shown hit harder whites covid every western country?  recommendation would give follow guidance medical regulators set -- know they're doing, they've seen raw data complete form humanly possible, confident vaccine safe effective. appointment get second dose, would *strongly* urge get it. everyone goal ZeroCovid. adults house vaccinated, would think mental load kids far worse catching Covid, assuming serious conditions like cancer organ transplant. Every family make decision themselves. 

A lot inner-city youth rely scholarships keep lives track end streets. Losing sports would far worse catching Covid kids families due extremely low IFR kids. What's wrong individual choices?

Some Amish also refuse modern machines medicine. (Not everyone.) cannot force them.

Anyone take vaccine accepts risk level, that's it. work resturant like 30+ people employed, know 2 people gotten get vaccine. rediculous *cries Albertan* Running trials seeking approvals FDA mistake. Let’s separate bit point you’re making, prioritizing access. good news. reason hold back trials seeking authorization vaccines good data about. vaccine dose poorly allocated here, getting ducks row vaccine supply grows. We’ll ready vaccinate kids enough go around. hugely important. Yes. Trump failure every level came dealing pandemic thank god decided invest vaccines. Credit credit due. could chosen to. time Im glad Biden's white house thats charge distribution Trump's. actually think administrations adequate job helping get roll vaccine. Even Biden said “give credit it’s due trump.” Bidens roll pretty good, Trump pretty good job purchasing lot vaccine. Ultimately though, federal administration shouldn’t one put blame/accomplishment instead individual governors. look looks like now. Jesus kidding. honest-to-god looks 30 years younger, except subtle difference tip nose gives away age, since nose ears grow life elderly people slightly red bulbous look. **Wake giant** Absolutely.

When you’re running beds, meds, O2 it’s bad day.

We edged many places US. Plenty patients probably would done better higher acuity ICU wouldn’t survive transfer one actually space.

And that’s superpower, get something like Brazil... Ontario Alberta?

Atlantic Canada doesn’t really need help seeing. U.S. care countries tho. U.S. would rather vaccinate heard immunity including children sharing. wonder that. vaccinations already required. One problem covid vaccine official, ""emergency use mandate"". I'm OK getting 5G Vax, Windows 10? Hell no!!! 100% sure production process, development super fast. 

Just wrote another comment expect governments fund construction mRNA capable facilities ready.

For $10 billion could ask Pfizer build 5 brand new facilities annually output 400 million doses. two shot structure, means covering US 4-5 months time. 

That's hell insurance policy. trying argue all. I'm saying immune escape something completely different initially implied. initial statement false: Immune escape exists. Variants escape immune activity. measured mRNA vaccines natural immunity. reason scientists think results important, implications proceed manage virus going forward.

That said, immune escape, SA variant least, less practical problem mRNA vaccines far--it technically negatively affects them, mRNA-induced response robust immune escape appear hurting effectiveness IRL. However, escape remains challenge vaccines population centers relying mix natural vaccine-induced immunity. Non-mRNA vaccines appear reduced real-world effectiveness certain variants. weird seeing something thoughtful social media.

Also exchange u/Rheticule feels like every Canadian stereo type come true. Chinese vaccines traditional deactivated virus vaccines. reliable data, looks like perform well. point, doubt mRNA vaccines replace types vaccines. better every respect. Honestly, guys choice. large percentage dying considering understanding. Could guys go another 5 months? \+1 fully vaccinated count. second Pfizer shot today! seems J&amp;J vaccine, also uses Adenovirus already got reports clotting investigating. Still emergency use authorizations. Formal FDA approval usually requires years worth red tape achieve. There's big shift people 40s-60s age bracket getting hospitalized older people mostly vaccinated. Like long they're safe they're going protect kids f*** that's need. narrative I'm hearing everywhere children infected immune already irresponsible. Well, successfully contained last two novel coronaviruses, sure yeah lets go narrative world always Die Hard. Makes easier sleep night. worry hit 75%

&amp;#x200B;

Not lack effort trying.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid 35% damn country going stupid enough refuse vaccine. Finally got appointment scheduled first 15th dreaded side effects dose 2 never came me. sore arm. sore dose 1. That's it. even migraine either dose, despite fact last season's flu shot gave one. hype nothing. everyone going feel awful it. I’ve also heard COVID much likely intense side effects. Still, absolutely worth it!  situation pretty bad Michigan right now. New cases high they've ever deaths hospitalizations rise. suspect largely UK variant, affects younger people past. 

Just trying give context. sorry work people like that. take - owe kids. try vaccines make sure work pushes work onto young. sets humanity back. talk much returning school damaged kids pandemic, well vaccines chance PROVE give damn kids. want purchase fine XBox Series X machine matters?  size shouldn’t matter leading example. Calling rude. Everyone avoid gatherings control Covid vaccines widely available. elaborate please? happen? 1.8bn. Jesus. 

I'm guessing they're going Pfizer one. old saying really ringing true ""you always count America right thing, tried everything else"" anyone else chuckle articles reporting new restrictions now. year later ""yep time sure!"" sure related comment. didn’t say anything contrary disagree.

I stated EUA causing hesitation among people don’t think that’s incorrect.

To add comment, never vaccine side effects show 6 weeks post vaccination would literally unprecedented unheard mRNA vaccines caused side effects late. Yeah got vaccine weeks ago willing drive conservative part state. There’s definitely higher demand cities less conservative areas Since real herd immunity threshold depends population heterogeneity unknown, whether reached herd immunity determined empirically. Given current R value lack significant restrictions, appears indeed reached herd immunity.  workout? theory use muscles easier time dealing side effects. older people family (obviously gym rats) pretty strong reactions This. really hard work beginning. many, many reasons people try vaccine. Could lazy. Could scared hurts. Could education. Could technical know understanding sign up. 

We need get past barriers first..mainly getting shot every arm wants one. roll sleeves dissect reasons folks staying away. need carrots need sticks. need outreach vulnerable communities. need hold social media platforms accountable misinformation. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  74% state's population Clark County anyone thinks cases going drop zero?

I think people realize endemic foreseeable future. Eradicating diseases incredibly hard already know one mutate around vaccines still prevent severe disease death, mutations make harder eradicate.

I guess issue summarized this: exactly going get ""mild endemic state"" without herd immunity?

If 50% population immunity, thing going keep swirling. necessarily dangerous ""We overwhelm hospitals"" level, ""This causing lot illness death good thing"" level. Levels higher I, layman, would consider mild endemic level.

To me, two basically go hand hand. going get mild endemic level without herd immunity, hit herd immunity we're talking weeks thing goes mild endemic level. think issue long term implications, especially amongst segments population (unknown lung damage/reduced function, behavioral psychological changes, vision issues, loss taste, etc) yet known well enough. someone get sick and/or die mean negatively impacted. Also, longer human reservoir continue adapt... cases less bad virulent, cases virulent worse. seen UK, South African, etc variants. 1. Patents aren’t nobody else manufactures vaccines. process incredibly complex, it’s matter “publishing method”. mRNA code used Moderna (for example) already public knowledge. hard part encapsulating mRNA requires dozens specialized suppliers making complex ingredients combining ingredients specific, controlled way get final result. little deviation either deliver little useful mRNA people don’t develop immunity deliver much people get sick. don’t copy paste process plants, would take longer spin factories try distribute resources validating manufacturing process let folks know make proven lines. know labs would cut corners make work, release ineffective dangerous vaccines, end destroying confidence vaccines. going convince anyone take shot Moderna-knockoff lab kills dozen people bad vaccine? wouldn’t take one.

2. Remember WWII US huge economic boom? first country recover seeing manufacturing base wasn’t bombed out. thing going happen post-COVID. Countries get populations vaccinated first get economic spoils. government signs UN-sponsored dumpster fire instead prioritizing citizens guilty malpractice. restaurants I'm sure : ""nah""

Don't blame either. Clark County Las Vegas located. state mostly empty otherwise (with exception Reno). surprise cases would Vegas metro area. talking about? exactly thing stopping getting spreading it. It’s 100% nothing is. case, reduces symptoms. Stop getting news crazies Facebook. seems... extremely low, unless I'm missing something. civilians died county alone. lot non-anti-science people also say ""I'm going wait while"" end getting too. Prevent how?

Vaccinate ASAP? Cool.

Restrict peoples livelihoods, mobility, education, etc? cool.

Its care/dont care decision. least harmful trade decision. 

No one likes loss life happen life goes on.  comment insanely idiotic. hell think intestinal worm could affect DNA humans, I’ll never know. 100% trials, real world. deaths people considered fully immune. I've read people high risk factors (80+, multiple comorbidities) begin with. 


That said, I'll take 99.999%. No, yet know. evidence, need months data confident it. would surprise Israel herd immunity - impossible, vaccinated numbers bit low expect even well Pfizer real world. countries using mix vaccines appear probably quite good - really know real appearances. 

Odds US reach herd immunity experts enough data confident have. true, it’s also true people tend spend time among people similar them. Far right Republicans tend spend time among far right Republicans, that’s one points herd immunity likely break vaccination rate low among . Probably situation among African Americans vaccine hesitancy stays high. think need ad campaigns targeted groups achieve true herd immunity. little hope. work construction industry 3/4 guys work refuse get vaccine. think got lucky. Two friends got J&amp;J reaction yours. got yesterday reason know fever water tastes like beer thats left outside 2 days. Looking comment history seem bit obsessed UK Brexit. like jilted ex. hurt you? time move on. still friends can't come more. 

Immigrants? welcoming millions compatriots HK, set regional hubs help access services learn language needed?

Swap Carling Moretti AZ Pfizer though (I'm 32 got Pfizer 3 weeks ago, underlying health conditions) like know me. love Greggs. Thanks! help. NPR low quality source? Gotcha, thank you! don’t think lot vaccinated people choosing wear masks longer recommended. Wearing mask anytime im public really sucks annoying. I’ll keep I’m fully vaccinated, mask mandates lifted, everyone chance get vaccinated. wear after, sort status/identity symbol. Saw stat Israel slowed recent surge (when getting hit hard B117) hit 57% vaxxed. US peeking 4th surge due variant, need get vaccines somewhere around 57% ASAP. think vaccine acceptance much higher that, wish urgency among stragglers. Texas open eligibility almost 2 weeks still large amounts friends even looked booking appointment, even though answer poll whether they'd get they'd say yes they'd get jab.  choice a) people taking vaccine b) taking vaccine month later.. I’d pick latter. big problem. means people without access transportation babysitters getting it. uncommon problem. People Cincinnati trying go Kentucky, people Delaware trying go Philadelphia, Maryland/Virginia/DC folks, Kansas City KS/MO, St. Louis MO/IL, list goes on. survey online predict weekly vaccine numbers next three months. predicted slow rise high 90000 cases week early June decline.

I might follow look study results, academic study. Same. Shocked LITTLE reaction got Pfizer. sore injection site hour time, that's it. Israel superior position NZ except fact 130x people per capita died covid along way Agreed! rules businesses people though. average folks fined US either. Obviously politicians hypocrites aren’t getting special treatment enforcement. (Except Pelosi haircut maybe?); newsom dinner bad look rule breaking.  Re-read one bud. said joke. Come on, that's bad-faith framing request. They're asking complete medical records, one document showing going spread dangerous disease grandparents. reason seems ""weird"" unprecedented circumstances. information put risk sharing vaccination status? *only* thing shows got shot. covid vaccines tested vaccines prior general use human history. reason vaccine development takes much time things they're trying prevent much less common longer studies efficacy needed. Covid infections prevalent efficacy testing completed quickly.

Also, groundwork vaccines started almost decade ago SARS.  Strange, every supermarket I've ever country bag items. uruguay family took Sinovac told thay take say 3 6 months road. like getting virus, simply something might happen.

In fact, they're making plans see even need go somewhere else get better vaccine months road. That's incorrect -- already, please report comment thread (assuming sub) address appropriately!

There's several things wrong notion. biggest problem statement (amongst many problems) person's assertion immune system can't clear infections central nervous system, true.

But even true, argument someone gets vaccinated, immunity protect neurological involvement later get infected. exact thing said natural immunity well -- someone getting infected, assume immune response can't enter CNS, still left neurological impact. short, argument actually argument vaccination, argument getting infected.

And want perfectly clear: statement factually incorrect begin with. even basis comment factually incorrect, argument even internally consistent.

Hope helps! sure lot ""The U.S. hoarding vaccines"" talk thread. Funny four years ""F U.S., need you"" quickly turned ""Please Sir, vaccines?"". Also note Roman Catholic church, stringent sizeable denominations comes this, said Pfizer Moderna morally okay get. abortion way way back 60s/70s something lead cell-lines used, people morally culpable using would like saying people morally culpable today using tech developed Nazi scientists WWII Whoosh BREAKING.NEWS? get information GDP growth? lot companies cut costs many ways. Meaning someone else losing revenue. got J&amp;J yesterday part vaccinated 20%. 

I cant even imagine kind incompetent state chasing tail we'd election went way. One major cities people entire country NZ. Many restaurants gone electronic menus pandemic, QR code scan phone see menu, disposable backups people phone whatever. expect many never go back, since also eliminates substantial expense. children cannot vaccinated going children wedding. also, it’s wedding want safe possible, that’s right since paying :) I'm guessing intentional, parroting long-debunked propaganda used try say hospitals faking COVID Trump’s false claim doctors inflate COVID-19 deaths make Thank you! Im trying challenge anyone anything. like share types posts people persuade get vaccinated, Im always keen knowing information comes from.

Thanks write up. interesting information put forth way even layman understand. I‘d surprised Germany would hit 5% mark year really nice something finally reflect country think are, country know be. American far speak critically functioning western democracies’ political entities, hand, wtf Canada Fords? (It answer please go extreme detail) shaming work would OK going further? sore shoulder mean worked. lot friends symptoms.. seems really variable person person. sore shoulder mean immune system recognized it. Make mandatory soon emergency use. would make interesting moments around country. would phenomenal. nearly 100 percent protection death ending hospital. I'm fully vaccinated longer worried catching virus worst would bad cold. much get jail free card! isolated island nation. comparable. cases county. That’s good news get Windows updates wake up, awesome. But! But! finally 5G house. streaming speeds, yo. 5G wherever go. Exactly, choice besides AstraZeneca don’t see problem. problem countries refuse tell you’re getting after. countries think going deter people getting vaccine resulting net negative.

People focused numbers... it’s going help people terrified side effects. would think tens millions shots given merely handful moderate side-effects, rewards vs. risk argument moot. think three year time frame poorer countries children. pretty obvious we'll vaccinated summer, roll rest world take long while. family Michigan acts like they’re island- enjoy boats rarely leave. count? 😂 rate country vaccinating, projections estimates around 2023 hit enough herd immunity say. would people still vote him? too!

It may herd immunity threshold lower originally hypothesized, plus herd immunity on-off switch, future cases slow every time individual becomes immune. Oh agree it’s better nothing, I’m also going pat back basically bare minimum. world talked shit U.S. past 4 years....but suddenly want help vaccines. Nope! Assuming people typical symptoms different normal flu season? vaccines less effective it, least three approved US still pretty good stopping it. mad 😂 Half friends American. Side effects immune system responding, preps dealing actual covid virus. 

I'll take side effects day keeps hospital. say countries like NZ aren’t already back normal. Also vaccines. found really kind liked giving strawberries &amp; veggies good swish pan water seeing dirt come off. also taking meat &amp; bread wrappers &amp; putting containers, &amp; things like bagged carrots, &amp; found makes inclined chop &amp; prep everything soon get - like, carrots &amp; broccoli chopped &amp; new bags ready gran, meat diced stir fry sliced whatever I’m planning do, bread parceled one batch gets frozen &amp; another batch fridge. I’m set next 2 weeks meals. that, dinners super fast. I’ll gonna keep that. Washing basically made go everything &amp; inspect &amp; get ready use. Unless campuses classes open full capacity, many likely see experts say institutions well within legal rights require returning students fully immunized coronavirus, although schools required law grant exemptions medical religious beliefs offer reasonable accommodations.

I'll guess exemptions difficult obtain. congrats. chills? Health agencies cautious absence evidence long immunity last. 90 days conservative minimum estimate likely increase data collected. it, could contagious, even short period. means transmit someone vulnerable.

More importantly, still circulating, still evolving. increases risk truly vaccine-resistant strain emerging.

We need stop fucking thing. ASAP. means inconvenience ignorant stubborn get vaccine, that's problem. could possibly care less. fact asking question way shows *know* there's export ban.

But dishonestly want continue insist is.

What matter you? understand ""ban"" means? 

Companies US freely export vaccine they've produced already bought. understand spread lot more, seem like aren’t effective necessary originally thought. look back numbers January.....what shitshow! Vietnam it, countries zero excuse. Nobody ever enforced knowledge. drove NYC New Jersey December easy peasy, check points quarantine enforcement kind. J&amp;J much cheaper ($3/dose compared $40/dose Moderna) doesn’t temp requirements much easier use massive scale. 

On individual level, mRNA vaccines offer higher protection. 

But they’re great preventing serious illness death reason choosy unless happen three readily available you. mechanism, though? two thoughts also. little caught guard since finally felt like didn’t worry anymore. Guess need realistic. here. Vaccinated since mid January. it’s soon me.

Our downtown areas aren’t even crowded tho. farmers markets/etc require masks anyway. Seems plausible.  lived countries, tbh, please get mad, pretty much 😂😂😂. Three WHOLE sessions?! Man, gift! /s Casual link causation. risk low, yes, like risk CVST. risk benefit equation changes depending prevalence COVID, right now, lot, AZ less risk nothing. (unproven) disparity different groups said 1/100k 1/1m. 

Your grievances AZ flat disinformation. 

I’m sure else link adds haven’t already said?

Just state you’re anti-vaxx move on. take ibuprofen, acetaminophen aspirin vaccination feel need there's nothing else medical history would prevent it. Otherwise, stay study talking about. Lots detail here. no, talking hospitalized cases.

 would Death row looking at. One there. asked Tom Friedman percentage Americans infection CDC estimate AMA week. linked two great sources - around 28%. account overlap, though. carve 33% 28%, 18.76% natural immunity only, 33% vaccine vaccine natural immunity. numbers add, totaling 51% form immunity right now.

There's ton assumptions - immunity immediate vaccines, less prior infected people may getting vaccine, upper/lower bounds wide - 15-48% per Wyman link - prior infection, etc. - estimate like guesswork. What's indisputable every day get closer herd immunity.

Also remember US is/will sort vaccination oasis. need globally finally put thing countries zero vaccinations. Russia China something like 5%. war go back normal (or normal-ish).

Here's AMA - Imagine participating drug trials compensation...that’s mental illness finest. first dose Pfizer felt queasy first 10 minutes observation chair. stared carpet. right edge something luckily subsided. felt little stiffness rest day. looking forward booster.  Good, start Italy US. Positivity rate accurate metric use since beginning this.

Accurate what? large swaths population need tested (since vaccinated following CDC guidance getting tested), positivity rate obviously going skewed up. meaningless point.

Raw positivity numbers far meaningful. got moderna Jan. First shot wasn’t bad. sore arm, sore throat, tired. 

Second shot OMG. Fever, chills, sore throat, headache, body hurt. couldn’t move like 30 hours gone. Felt normal again. 

I would given chance. worth it. guess US close border Canadians now. availability now. usage. Fewer fewer people getting tested (not Florida). comes issues. Remember CDC said data yet indicating children spreading virus? next question many children getting tested?  well, study complete turns children major spreaders. 

Pay attention stats course. pay closer attention statements worded. Look ""may"" ""appears"" ""yet"" dealing scientists.   Germany population 83 million. think area country affects vaccination speed much, least industrialized countries. important factor vaccine supply. Oh man hate plexiglass shields everywhere now. Nobody hear things + masks. masks good enough? seem bit ott silly. That's great hear! Glad worked - whole point decision parents need make, necessarily easy one. children may struggling socially may like current school conditions. decision perfect solution every child alive. Nah deserved shit Berghain reopening Well, even get 5%, there’s almost zero chance even getting symptomatic case vaccine. cares anymore it’s likely cold somebody vaccine? Nope, tried. Mods locked AMA, new comments available. Half office went downstate get theirs, it’s ridiculous. think USA whole reach herd immunity long time. Certain regions will, certain regions small outbreaks Covid deaths long, long time. 18-29 10x. 

40-49 130x.

Where 2.5x?

Looks like 13x Same. anything, made realize filthy people surroundings are.   I've chugging stuff like pedialyte since got shot. hopefully helps. hunger cook dinner tonight. thought alone makes wanna gag reason UK system would perfect Italy. one shot starting oldest working down. second shots younger people later.

One shot plus 2-3 weeks activation time stops nearly hospitalizations deaths. time finish things properly. that's true every vaccine currently use. know say ""fact is"" actually supposed follow facts used friendly banter owned Justin Bieber pandemic turned really dark Canada better US. I’m going reply comment ask him, then. doubt he’ll respond though, since AMA over.......  mandate probably go away phases. First would masks required outside. masks inside vaccinated. masks required anywhere. USA 6-8 weeks behind Israel follow mask-mandate progress project USA. Canada Public perception huge them. wife second shots Moderna days ago fever/aches/chills came nighttime left 24 hours later. tylenol really helped keep super manageable that's suggestion worried it. Schools required vaccines decades. It’s different. 20-54 young adults lol? lockdown though I've also noticed trend sub downvoting negative news regarding pandemic. also feel like mods deleting posts categorized political preventing people posting news source seen political.

The pandemic response inherently political, see trying get away that. 

I think sub started getting ""denialist"" around Feb. good news vaccine people worried another surge/kids getting infected, gets downvoted. link askreddit post, please share! suspicious change moderators/leadership here. continue baffled virus. 

Two half weeks ago SIL small group gathering noone masked. talking side side overly close. 

COVID hit people group. 

About week gathering tested positive:

I talking face face 5 feet away us wearing masks good half hour. 
Her mother house 7 hours talking playing kids eating lunch. 
Her sister hour visiting. 

She positive, kids positive, husband positive. 

I'm negative, mother negative, sister negative week half. 

How even happen? Mask mask explained away masks work. rest? teacher correct. principle immune system would treat yet another infection temporarily increase antibody production. Stop 50% higher use hard numbers. know don't, still insignificant.

Second, fucking numbers showed 20-54 year olds lol. [It's quote datasheet. ""Strain sequencing conducted available samples sufficient viral load centrally confirmed COVID-19 cases (one sequence per case). February 12, 2021, samples 71.7% central laboratory confirmed primary analysis cases sequenced \[United States (73.5%), South Africa (66.9%) Brazil (69.3%)\].

they least tested variants gave data. might worth mention efficacy numbers 2 4 weeks intervals 1 dose compared Pfizer's 1 week second dose. noob reading understood pfizer looking 1 positive pcr + 2 symptoms efficacy determination vs J&amp;J 1 pcr + 1 symptom. Anyway expert concerned person trying find best family. liked finding concrete numbers vs vague statements read news articles. Maybe hello friend happy hours (once safe do)?  - Tests: 1,861,551 - Cases: 78,810 - Deaths: 1,010 - Currently Hospitalized: 39,852 - Currently ICU: 7,600 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

Care check major donor past 5 years Jenner institute - Oxford vaccine developped?

A small hint - actually think getting gun simple proving 18 years old felon. Similarly, take vote proving 18 year old American haven’t voted election. 

However, voting owning gun rights, rights easy exercise Here’s still effective it, slightly less... fact country variant supposedly coming already seeing decline cases deaths says lot. Finally good news, reports getting depressing... many kids lost parent. There’s point toughing you’re uncomfortable. take pain meds, aren’t going mess vaccine. Google it. news everywhere. Oh that's awesome! still require masks venues? clubs work? Honestly, doctor/hospital contact cdc Pfizer ask them. 

If makes feel better, UK waiting 9-12 weeks doses. right get vaccinated right infect others. want near people need get vaccinated.

I right spit right spit someone’s face, partially due chance giving disease. Covid changes rules even near someone risky spitting someone. virus surfaces remains theoretically possible, noted. requires many things go wrong: lot fresh, infectious viral particles deposited surface, relatively large quantity quickly transferred someone’s hand face. “Presence surface equal risk,” Dr. Allen said.

I hope info prompt people go full gross touching anything everything face mouth without proper hand washing. Observing many family members co-workers read headline make variation info gives little confidence.

While welcome news read - worth looking linked data half-life virus various surfaces treat situation accordingly.

I got first shot yesterday. 

I got scheduled last week I’ve never careful. Next time UK government might reconsider force Oxford partner with

It ain’t bad. I'd extremely skeptical claim. Many studies small, like hundred people, could sick group people hospital. also studies side argument [95% former COVID patients suffer irreversible damage, Israeli study covid"" thing like ""variants"" scares crap people pretty light facts. Yeah feel like never control vaccines bail us out. People take pff masks talk strangers etc. about? ever claim Denmark Estonia dense? scroll see comment Finland specifically, believe Sweden would've able get Denmark-levels, maybe Finland/Norway levels, due advantage here, knows. sure started talk countries suddenly ok.  taken allergy pill? cured back-of-the-mind thoughts symptoms.

All three 21 younger underlying/at-risk conditions. 

US vaccinating anyone everyone now. We’ll soon guess takeaway is, contract Covid also poor oral health, real chance Covid experience hard.  enough say bad oral health results serious Covid. Yes found many ""long covid"" studies include anxiety symptom, without quantifying many people particular symptom. Obviously completely different situation neurological disease. rights violate? government isn’t issuing them...

There’s famous quote often attributed Benjamin Franklin - right swing fist ends another mans face begins. even debating China withholding data bad, need independent investigation. Please update precise language. replies go good detail numbers really look like. UK still relatively strict lockdown whereas gather, US lot places. cut crap give freedom - worth million counselors.  Realistically probably happening already. People priority groups able get shots via employment, getting ""extra"" shots, simply lying applications. Consider example smoker get shot places.

Strictly numbers perspective, somehow super strict giving shots risk, definition, would reducing overall risk maximum amount. would argue 1:0 ratio among PP NP. reality impossible implement done. Masks help stop spread, right? second Moderna pretty much like first.  Sore arm caused sleep badly possible headache 3 day it. Though knowing could caused letting self get dehydrated.  favorite thing walking work meeting seeing everyone wipe space Clorox wipes take masks talk other. 
🤷‍♂️ seems quite obvious UK allowed AZ export 0.7% required 100m UK first doses, purely people can’t claim UK hoarding supplies. Import 47m “vaccine nationalist EU”, prove suddenly also exporting sending mere pitance AZ.

I don’t think coincidence UK get 17m Moderna vaccines use AZ 8.5m 30s. long UK Pfizer Moderna going forward excess AZ - wouldn’t surprised 10k AZs get exported UK knows plant meet second doses.

Meanwhile, EU still appears exporting ~half production. think EU naively thought country hoarding would get bad press - UK US stampeded ahead whilst EU left short. Vaccine passports used work betriebsarzt regularly hearing checkups stuff. I’m sorry son, also sounds like showing symptoms pretty early whereas OP’s immune system still thing bay. Could still show symptoms? Sure, sounds like son’s case one roughest experienced healthy people age group. No. much insinuated do. talking about? think need re-read post(s).

You said ""people seriousness discussing Santa Claus logistics distributing gifts flying reindeer"". talking context? I'd assume Christians, since Santa Claus affiliated would love find argument. problem issue argued, persons needs convincing.

So make comments rant illegitimacy religion, proceed say religious people intended audience. trying convince? said would love listen argument. consider open-minded person qualms listening argument meant sway even talking first reply (where referred wikipedia). commenting topic right define christian not. 

I'm gonna point replied parent comment, said (emphasis own) ""It **you** define christianity."" ""you"" made sound like targeted comment towards took so. Definitely unprompted view. meant generalized, sure, that's came as. There's reason got downvoted quite bit even know christian wrote it

That's bad suppose. replying comment, replying another comment someone replying parent comment asking explain differences Mormons Christians would show different religions, mentioned reply Christian. guess mindset would see replying accused hating christianity, attacking etc.

You pretty frickin aggressive comment man, clearly showed distaste Christians. Saying help mormons believe Jesus actually son god, equally misguided christianists, equal right considered christian.

Sounds like would consider Mormons less misquided consider Christian. Maybe I'm reading like tho knows? Words internet thoughts literally First belief. 

Strongly believing religions bunch lies belief man. sure claim otherwise. Beliefs religious thing. political beliefs, societal beliefs, economic beliefs, etc. definitely Come think it, really stop using word ""atheist"" myself. dedicated word needed default, normal position. word people believe Santa Claus, would word people believe god(s)?

Default, normal position huh? ""Normal"" decided society, individual alone. majority world dabbles religion, I'd argue religious norm. Maybe grew China Baltic nation majority atheist view, argue normal, world not. Santa Claus viewed anybody way god is, can't equate two. weak Second, I'm forcing anything you. unprompted said, contrary driving debate forward. fine me, pretend not.

I driving debate forward? dunno man debate seems pretty mutual me, act like reply first proceed reply replies. yes, constantly insisting someone God initially ask form forcing belief onto them. forceful ways could so, sure, 'un'holy war considered forcing beliefs. already explained unprompted point view address part opposition religions nothing ethics all. 100% irrelevant. irrational views physical world built. existence god(s), paradise, hell, miracles stuff like that. This, this, basis opposition religion. 

Hey, closest actually gotten writing explanation beliefs. Finally. Well, I'll say understand reasoning. feel way many religions (although go way Reddit exclaim disbelief form dislike beliefs). think one typical common reasons people would give. understand devotion telling people wrong, looking post history (I apologize makes feel violated. want understand type person may public), seem pretty cynical general I'm gonna hold anything (I'm fan guy ... wrongly believed god existed.) comes good bad behavior, religions worse better ideologies moral frameworks people build. human made rules, good not.

Don't jump gun buddy proof, know care about, prove anything claim, can't treat fact. yeah Benjamin Lay interesting Also, think used word could argue religionism even worse anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers similar groups least try construct rational looking arguments.

You literally compared us anti-vaxxers climate change deniers, among harmful groups. people literally reject actions deny movements save lives. Unless somehow think great people, insinuating bad them. need use mean prove negative.

Lol. can't claim something negative without proving is. That's scientific logic. sense logic say Norway exist long disregard whatever anyone else says I'm justified think I'm right. claim physical proof existence God, literally claim regarding proof spaghetti-monster expert, suspect can't disprove either paragraph questions, somehow try see place christianity there.

The flying spaghetti monster clear obvious joke made letter protesting education board's decision teach intelligent design alternative evolution. I'm replying convert anything, know trying challenge philosophical questions world exists. instance, since one trying make unfalsifiable claims, need address Russell's teapot prove right. two sentences believing miracles whatnot proves nothing.

Also, saw arguing another guy said he's atheist. might wanna consider words, cuz he's speaking facts.

**Hospitalization data - new admissions**: - uptick new hospitalizations 

**Hospitalization data - total admissions**: data - ~23% rise 52K 7-day average mid-March 64K today**: know folks keen debate obvious point. said post, crisis, trying melodramatic. commented [positive inflection point hospitalization literally day ended ultimately peaking. Data is. 

I'd get people riled said ""oh gosh, cases slightly going up! need lock NOW!"" that's said. Blaming lockdowns families wanting near loved ones hospital low, smacks trying hide incompetence political impotence. France locked way things got point. know similar data exists Moderna? personally know two ppl extremely hard time getting vaccine Michigan. finally got one find day shots one exposed work. currently sick covid. much harder get vaccinated Florida. true, vaccines like AZ transferred refrigerator temperature important reasonable say major driver suicides could deal people? 

I'm trying joke around here, completely see that. Figure plenty friends close family members seen year, also plenty toxic jerks, enablers soul-suckers who've found separated victims. Could elaborate applied tension technique? heard people getting microchips shots? I'm trying get ripped off. WalGreens reputable place get shots make sure get microchips them? Ace Hardware KN-95s stock months hope find something. Definitely would concern going stop here. import J&amp;J one think also moderna. LA City weird. could driving 10 blocks get LA city step another city back la city again. good example going West LA Santa Monica. know shows 4 million LA City, reality it’s huge “city sprawl” 11 million so.

The colored ones LA city non colored ones city part LA county. makes way sense.  [Texans gets may 1 4 now, (perhaps overly optimistic) opinion, become less time. see friends family vaccinated bad results change minds. 

Some realize vaccine required travel work school something desire give vaccinate.

Some already covid natural immunity length time. 

I believe, hope, number choose vaccinate closer 1 10 said done. whatever pre-covid antivax proportion was. 

Any opportunity shut antivax misinformation pipeline (whether Facebook, Fox News, etc), beneficial society. I’m ecstatic among third one shot. Second dose April 28! Let’s this! Also, U.S. Department Wildlife put report Americans visit Australia dangerous.


(Just joke, people!) No, time put lives hold long ""what ifs"". Get first shot tomorrow. surprising given Mississippi highest share African Americans US state also lot conservative whites. groups lower vaccine uptake rates basically demographic group.  BioNtech/Pfizer general still emergency use USA? Others approved regularly. Agreed. Posting ""I felt fine"" boring interesting. 

I shots. felt perfectly fine them. COVID back November supposed someone going worse side effects. happen. Canadian say PLEASE GIVE US PLEASE far away states we'll pandemic you

As usual, good time California! thing science rigid inflexible. supposed be. novel virus. studies came contradicted previous research, scientists changed recommendations accordingly. sure I'm downvoted, nearly 25% Michigan's population under-16 means can't get vaccinated. obviously contributing rise cases, largest age group positive COVID right 10-18. topic? We'll still achieve level vaccination among adults albeit slower. “People’s lives hold” — hey BUD, people dying (lol) I’ll give anecdote. I’m late 20s, active healthy. pretty similar symptoms had, except addition neurological symptoms. virus messed memory, focus, even gave vertigo. normal cold symptoms took maybe 3 4 days go away, mental symptoms took solid month, even 4 months later, occasionally feel like may still effects. Even symptoms milder second go around, don’t want risk virus mess brain again. got vaccinated moderna, symptoms super mild. sore arm fever around 99 day first dose. Indeed. given fomites seem quite vector originally believed, long shouting match cashier shopping quite safe. vaccines typically produce long term effects since vaccines tested nearly year i'd say that's enough time solid foundation trust. say, 'we,' one dark.  anyone UK reading this, please aware we're still lockdown though. can't go barber drink pub outdoors Monday. middle May we'll able go pub/restaurant indoors.

Vaccine rollout gone really great far, course, get impression we're living post-Covid land. We're much as, more, locked countries. chance properly mix yet. saying send numbers spiralling anything, worth aware! I'm fully aware. Europe control it, would block export well. can't. Rip Low risk good risk. seeing constant hand disinfection hand washing still thing, there's reason continue clean things handled people: groceries. hurt wipe surfaces, especially common items used amongst people officers. harm long risk zero effort minimal, I'll continue this. 
I think lot people get feeling satisfaction control use ""overzealous"" describing useful practice assert dominance virus. relatively strict. cities UK meeting someone indoors illegal year. Yeah US reach 100% slower cause anti-vax sentiment. Plateau start 70% guys feel fully vaccinated hanging unvaccinated people already got virus? feel like likely re-infected. numbers? group 6 friends gotten infected before. Germany uses available vaccines? live? Yes. EU share import UK around 90% though (Biontech driven mainly)

I'm sure get 90% from.

As 28 March 202, UK used around 14.6 million doses Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine 19.5 million doses Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine - really needed import Pfizer one. European wouldn’t surprised negativity growing US, GB EU. Countries within EU start become protective companies likely want stay within native country boarder. way secure assets crisis. good “western alliance” long term. take rate already declining.

Better look per capita EUROPEAN add point ""Pfizer"" Vaccine German product outside US produced Pfizer BioNTech themselves, J&amp;J vaccine developed subsidiary Janssen Netherlands.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm sorry need restrict travel people vaccinated. difference ""zero"" COVID countries vaccinated vast majority population immune COVID. Also, need zero COVID go back normal. 

\+ EU leadership need accept fucked get AstraZeneca BioNTech/Pfizer. Taking guess way: aware ""Pfizer vaccine"" developed Germany German company? matter though. US influence export regulations foreign countries. easy get hard fact this, far understand British-based Croda  
 subsidiary Alabama (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc) supply Pfizer/Biontech uses. Doubt product ever sets foot UK though. yet agreements catered US. Somehow, miracously, since German vaccine, Germany can't use use AstraZeneca instead.

I understand created Germany scientists. splitting hairs. really care nationalist bullshit. I'm saying main actors bring market control agreements. usually like immediatly blame media, case, Reuters, will. might said bigger interview answer specific question, side note, know. ""article"", could even call that, joke, context given. factual statement, would okay headline like that.

In general agree, though. blame game (from parties) pretty tiring. True, bagged rice costs bulk rice too, I’m going cynical. begets poverty begets lack education begets overpopulation begets poverty ....... u get point.

Sounds like Covid Australia: 20%?!? 

20 people, take leave it. reason doubt started Kent. county literally connected mainland via tunnel. awfully big coincidence, think probably started Europe first clock hence coming Kent. We've reached ends analogy there. tragedy commons. Vaccines shared communal resource. They're product manufactured United States fill order made US government.

Whether Russian Chinese vaccine diplomacy pays become clear time. I'm skeptical given complaints like one. Russia China major, immediate impact people care America doing. Maybe looked extreme cases influenza. People still die that. saving people lot grief. actually managed 100.2% 75-70 range. vaccinated people age group even knew existed lmao. Noone know EU interest moving UK anyway think issue Oh...kids screwed certain parts country...but definitely college campuses now. 

U.K. variant going fuck kids grade school. doubt. get interesting need boosters get J&amp;J booster 2022 initial vaccination j&amp;J... opinion reason need focus mRNA ones future. Also different kind vaccination different illness cannot use vector anymore I'm wondering Small technical detail. nz allow Visa applications country non citizenship? I'm educator I'm fully vaccinated now. institution calls back, I'm in. Especially trend continues require vaccinations students campus. Alllll. Innn. Maybe, remember majority freight travel Europe comes Kent Eurotunnel Dover. Also, who’s enforcing this?

the government playing shadow regulation businesses. Vaccines work. Americans love billionaires Well yes, really import Pfizer-Biontech vaccine, EU global production hub. understand coming from. 

I'm guessing 'messing up' body take longer develop strong immune response rather developing one all. 

That's purely guess though, GED vaccines Google, take worth. nice CDC catch us knew 6 months ago. Awesome! Even yesterday! 720.000

www.impfdashboard.de Indeed, country almost fully open, additional existing restrictions relaxed every week, reproduction number 1, new cases, hospitalizations deaths dropped 85%-95% since mid January, healthcare system longer real threat. 

In practice everyday life Israel today either similar less restricted ""zero COVID countries"", much less risk renewed outbreak would require escalating restrictions, much closer safely relaxing travel restrictions. Given ""Zero COVID"" countries, despite current figures, perusing vaccinations eventual herd immunity, Israel obviously much closer today end goal. EU really need get story straight. truth UKs manufacturing capacity approved vaccines quite small EU keep demanding UK exports them? EUs repeated comparisons exports illogical consider comments like Bretons would expect country almost reliant EU export itself.

It’s similar weeks ago whole export/ Pfizer lipid debate. UK stopped exporting lipids retaliation EU stopping Pfizer exports would seriously impact Pfizer production. However response EU could survive without Pfizer manufacturing due Marburg factory would gain blocking Pfizer exports first place.

Either UK manufacturing required EU EU isn’t great place production capacity, EU enough UKs insignificant, makes demand UK exports look unnecessary. opinion it’d latter EU seem switch two doesn’t reflect well them. ""UK 4 different vaccines manufactured domestically - ignoring whatever import (which EU anyway)? ""

EU share import UK around 90% though (Biontech driven mainly) company owns vaccines exporting? Oh, I've seen one before, spoiler alert: reopening What? 

Yes nothing fact us actively blocking vaccine exports.
BionTech owns vaccine much Pfizer does. „Pfizer“ vaccine created BionTech, German company produced Pfizer. US vaccine, it’s german vaccine. understanding well completed second dose astrazeneca yesterday. looking forward could go back normal life end year (wishful thinking know gotta stay positive). maybe people scared death injections (for reason other) choose get J&amp;J one shot vaccine. twice. 'de-facto ban', lipids exported, vaccines exported? like saying make one sandwich day eat it, export ban sandwiches. - simply supply demand.

The simple fact is, UK domestic production supply outstripped domestic demand stipulated contract AZ. EU could signed similar contract AZ scaled production help meet demand, knowing AZ could also export vaccines elsewhere existing factories signed contracts (which did). EU, rather naïvely, (or least extent should).

This even moral issue. UK domestic production export en masse like EU, contributed significantly COVAX, per capita pretty much every developed nation. even UK can't export domestic production, effect export vaccines paid for.

There seems misconception AZ (or company), factories inside EU, owes EU vaccines produced there. world works. AZ owes EU taxes. Contracts, factories, determine vaccines sent. basic fact. Getting first vaccine tomorrow! Wow, government finally achieved something! lead world, congratulations! Partnerships supply completely different main actor owns it. end day US owns Moderna Pfizer vaccine. production agreements. 

Sure, local company bio emergent solutions produces J&amp;J vaccine state well. it. production agreements. real lockdown. Churches still open, employers allow home office even though absolutely possible many cases. Police check people wearing masks. lockdown Poland. restrictions. someone invited 1000 guests wedding reception, 100 guests allowed per hour. couple stand ~~take pictures~~ get COVID 8 hours. take large enough sample people days, always going people die.

People focusing AZ's blood clot cases causal link strongly suspected, i.e., blood clot cases likely caused vaccine. moment, aware anything similar Pfizer Moderna (let's hope keeps way). many hitting target, true, however us rush. US act quick stop people dieing. wait guys tell us side effect get mine mid-end year. I'm sure asking me. point country different place draws poverty line. Whats considered poverty line US would well countries. doubt lower percentage people Chile live poverty US standards. Well that’s good Hmm. Okay. Maybe shoots theory down. ""Talk doctor taking over-the-counter medicine, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, antihistamines, pain discomfort may experience getting vaccinated. take medications relieve post-vaccination side effects medical reasons prevent taking medications normally.

It recommended take medicines vaccination purpose trying prevent side Two reasons - 

1. reduces chance catch begin 90%. know phase 3 trial data. you’ve got 90% reduced chance ever infected begin with, you’re obviously less likely spread it. 

2. event still catch it, seems reduce chance pass 90%. still developing piece information studies pretty consistently showing this. Apparently catch covid vaccinated, viral load reduced least three quarters, makes far harder go infect someone else. 

So 90%+ less chance catch 90%+ less chance transmit do, need behavior changes host. That’s WAY better numbers cloth masks social distancing give us. EU exporting US vaccine? Pardon me? vaccine exactly? Yes, fact top new EU when/how use *Sputnik V* telling need know... thats it. Switzerland moderna produced company called Lonza, Germany Pfizers Partner BionTech produces vaccine. Belgium Pfizer plant, AZ produces Great Britain locations. 

The Eu never received vaccines us. banning exports us limiting us firmes outside it‘s borders, inside. 
While Pfizer still producing world facilities us banned that. 

The eu still exporting vaccines produced inside eu countries. going get circular. referring Europe exporting US vaccine, course export it. US vaccine agreements going specific that.

You're comparing US exporting US vaccine. [According Trump administration purchased around 800 million doses various vaccines approved. time left office, US contracts 400 million doses approved vaccines. Biden purchased additional 200 million February. someone sat next would probably talk rather sending emails. 
Sure, cases quick question/answer efficient conversation often isn’t. fan many unnecessary conf calls one one chat encouraged. Tough out... guy tells someone drugs stop drugs type.of person? favorite seeing pull mask could hear better. Yeah, heard me. citizens vaccination rate lower. I'm going fault America prioritizing Americans first (and succeeding). first rule safety class make sure safe helping others.

February BioNTech said delivery lipids main bottleneck. know still case. talking about? isn’t pedantic. mathematical relation you’re saying doesn’t exist. Differentials mythical. Case rates function *rate infections*. past 30 days, Canadian daily cases doubled US cases basically flatlined (higher it’s clearly going up) Canada, United Kingdom, Mexico, Israel, Chile, COVAX ... well, world. can't see anything picking quickly way they're waffling about, delaying making various excuses vaccine can't widely distributed. Plenty old farts want wait natives make vaccine, since foreign ones inferior designed kill, course...The fact they're still following olympics year ludicrous. Whole shit ton money made there, nobody allowed countries watch spend money here. whole situation incredible clusterfuck. Thanks sharing, hope gets better. 
And people still ignore threat :( absurd! People tough time statistics. came across someone thought variant 20% fatal, 100% chance infecting came contact. I’m sure heard numbers somewhere (“20% deadly” “75% contagious”) didn’t think much further. trends different levels right now, around 19 similar. seems like truthful fucking guy. Many countries simply hit target year. Brazil’s president fouled vaccine purchases can’t expect USA today somewhere 2022. Many poorer countries may way full vaccination 2023 later. Okay, back-of-the-mind fear one variants come along vaccines effective against, realize see abrupt spike hospitalizations deaths vulnerable populations.

Can anyone share articles what's done guard scenario, particularly US? mean, surely point monitoring prevalence variants seeing efficacy various vaccines catch something like worst-case scenario got hand? Except previous comment, EU created INTEX bypass Iran sanctions. past, there's guarantee giving away vaccines letting Americans die help future. Especially since EU agreed sanctions US levied Russia. 



I guess know much Covid situation EU, see Germany invested $440 million manufacturing production. rest EU nations band together increase production they? Yeah remote work. Even employees must work person, days could used mandatory trainings home. That’s used offer employees ran sick time. virologist podcast ( week virology) said variants don’t shit vaccines shot, feel strange urge stop using Linux happens GOP completely sweep midterms republican win presidency 2024 Brownie*
Resource support statements else opinion. way lasts another year would literally fucking kill It’s gonna years would literally fucking kill fuck Meanwhile countries whining side affects AZN vaccine instead moving forward. Suck sissies. They’re *not* similar level. trend lines look *nothing* alike surprising considering pretty much UK's domestic production vaccines set past year specifically Covid, whereas EU already factory vaccine production. speaking moistly !?.
What. The. Fuck. Fuck it’s gonna happen I'm Ireland vaccine shortfall currently. 1 millionth dose week arrived Ireland last week turning around quickly (though many super critical government's handling situation). said, comes taking care first long US companies reneging contracts support country ensuring house order helping neighbors. suffered heavily pandemic pause recovery aid another countries would expect another country so. 

As long US helps rest world citizens want vaccine one good me. can't help others falling apart yourselves. Israel proved world vaccines solution eliminate corona virus. test lot Likely population density government response. shitty handling crisis early led constant presence virus US communities. US population also way dense Canada's. Canada way 10 days behind US vaccinations, still valid question infections similar level That's f****** funny nobody ever realizes he's Canadian much bashes immigrants piece s*** ... nerve people like saying wanted see birth certificates people where's birth certificate oh yeah that's right big old Canadian claim him.
 speak Canadians say that. think fact we’re well great, however feel bad countries can’t keep pace progress.  we're like little sibling looks older sibling wants copy everything boil clothes without asking love America..... 
Hated Trump, (most us) ; love America UK second country Israel defeat corona virus. Glad I’m getting vaccine Sunday! Real talk right there!!! Australian completely agree above. shipped whole bunch astrazencia (doesn’t look good now) PNG support neighbouring country due safe situation. hand meant AUS couldn’t less rush vaccinate citizens. Feel free ask Qs Hopefully Pfizer's freeze-dried version vaccine pans out. I'm pretty jealous everyone's getting vaccinated f***. ... think finally reached like senior age 75 Montreal yay almost slowly surely meanwhile States they're like 16 older want vaccine got vaccine like Oprah giving free Christmas gifts... bet US thing masks sought stole vaccines countries. Oh sure! hope US does! Tbh Turkey even weirder spot diplomatically feel like going get everyone's vaccines lol vaccination really really good virus less places go know caught two three people contact able die spread like numbers like thank God mom like first like oh God parents Texas they're going die tiny industrialized I'm like f*** thank God they're Canada there's somewhere safe like Texas...
what f*** ... Another thing Americans? genuinely good people, loudest idiotic ones get publicity. Reddit loves Punch America. people like break Covid-19 regulations, support NRA AR-15s, get painted broad brush ""Stupid, lazy gun toting American"", point, pretty hard believe kind posts meant shit Americans. 


In terms headline, trying downplay what's happening Canada, emphasize issues America having. could rephrased less comparative, analytical headline, garner much ""America-Hate"". Osterholm also told us cases would ""Category V hurricane"" now. anybody listen him? ignore MRA trash, realize significant problems sides this.

Women's problems often ignored, men's.  CDC put report saying Americans visit Canada dangerous.... prolongation pandemic via vaccine nationalism certainly given. real risk. Many nations contributing well beyond US course though. I’m there’s ton variables it’s extremely complicated. main concern way people, governments media reverted bounded sovereignty ideal though. core find disconcerting regard, place US certainly takes centre stage. Imperial College London, junk science. Gotcha. know either feel like shuts like schools they're going address inequalities internet distribution cost lot people can't afford internet let alone distance learning second-hand crack screen smartphone ... Nah really think ignore feminist talking points realise society ""women children first"" mentality exists every problem concerning highly talked focused on. Well Turk agree hand China Russia bad things like human rights etc, I'd still much rather allies US Europe. Also send vaccines please :D dad got released hospital Poland 2 weeks. weak covid lift arms.

Well like, ""remember pandemic happened?? fuck crazy it, kids know lucky nowadays"" -future old person probably adults vaccinated, need vaccine anymore; given nature virus, kids probably get vaccine. 

Doesn't sound altruistic)) You’re absolutely right though. damage soft power already done shipping vaccines don’t need anymore benevolent act Americans might expect be. gravestone black gray? Try calling Walgreens cvs around 5-6pm asking extra doses! illinois lot ppl able get shot way! devices actually sold customers got used. vaccines never made anyone's arm. regerts People also need understand risk additive. 95% time might get COVID, repeatedly behave recklessly there’s uncontrolled spread, quickly find 5%. enough people vaccinated, knows harm might cause others process. AstraZenica shitlist it’s gonna take even longer.... hard think Scomo kicked cat last night? dying blood clot less painful Covid? so, I’ll take it! depends version receive. can’t imagine even idiot Doug Ford thought point.

The way Japanese people acted disaster shocked world. scale crisis leads chaos almost universally... mean towns swept away, nuclear crisis, etc etc. yet... kind chaos see anywhere else happen there. would expect Japan's people resistant type behavior America generated due differences culture- that's mentioned 3/11. culture- I'd like think least- confers certain advantages disadvantages.

I feel government failing hard- obvious Fukushima Daichi's mishandling. Plenty stuff worldwide though- list mishandlings COVID much longer list handled well. need KY resident. live Cincy scheduled appt today Covington (10 min house). turned away got site. thought said 70% good herd immunity I’ll likely sleeping, we’ll see goes Raython ton countries US.... laws I'd imagine everyone allows bonus! “I want people vaccinated, ultimately pro choice matters bodily autonomy.”

So didn’t say then? idea misunderstood it’s need give depth, words twisted. is, it’s support ridiculous amount freedom point harms others. may applied reasoning matters going store without mask infected, doesn’t mean you’re arguing wouldn’t apply that. “All bodily autonomy”. words. 

Beyond that, don’t see pointing businesses already information, beyond schools, twisting words. cite dangers minimum wage employees date birth? “ Again, would choice give people name DOB minimum wage employees pressures huge fines governmental regulations like medical industry“? Nobody thought that. Lockdowns simply best option slow infection rates keep ICUs overrun wait vaccine. would agree J+J thing. Moderna/pfizer 2 weeks (80%) better J+J ever gets (75%? Something like that), seems odd hold people different bar others. 

I get CDC non-confusing messaging that's say ""fully vaccinated"", think it, kinda funny. Including kids? Really? credit American government securing vaccines. boasted deals nothing.


Those things related. Threre COVID vaccine manufacturing plants USA Canada expected supplied well. However, USA blocked vaccine exports, leaving Canada dry long time.

The rest world supplied plants EU, India. countries also ordered vaccines China Russia.

Yes, means tail wagging dog. I'm blame people tired, *do* blame people forget whole point try prevent mass death. bad mutation brought us back 2020 death rates, moral thing would shut again.

But, hopefully remain hypothetical. Good Israel. seem gotten things pretty good vaccination campaign probably could safely open now, it’s smart wait month sure isn’t flare one newer variants. There's lot vaccines lot variants, generally lower efficiency rate, work all.

But even lower efficiency, think people end less severe symptoms. Found I've moving circles feel getting little sore. Gonna go chug water go bed. não é bom hardcore fringers that. small percentage people, less 10%. let use social media form narrative. see bullshit line, politely challenge facts. move Really can't stand see anything nice US? weird attitude. Hello. Canada... Yes! 100%. important compassionate least attempt meet people they're at. read studies vaccinations especially starting look closely protect asymptomatic infection. Pfizer example looking like it’s 90% effective preventing infected all. Yep. That’s really good analogy could simply break patents let countries develop them. US doesn’t capacity, let China, India, countries manufacture them. could easily adults world US wasn’t hellbent protecting profits big pharma, really boils to. 

As always though, we’re choosing let god knows many people poorer countries get sick die, mention greatly increasing risk escape variant developing, C-suite Pfizer take home bigger bonuses. maybe rural pockets anti vaxx popular, urban centers fine.

That’s true every state distinguishing “red” states “blue” states urbanization. People Seattle seem eager get vaccinated [rural Washington much  ""I hate US"" depends whether enough uptake achieve herd immunity. Correction: 60 doses per 100 individuals, number first doses amounts around 30% field mRNA vaccination discovered Ingmar Hoerr CureVac, time University Tübingen. What's point? None discarded doses allocations discussed .62% would enormous percent allergic reaction, approved came testing. Probably vasovagal allergic. Ignorant people began associating dislike Trump America whole. hope world finally heal virus right wing populism over. Likewise USA - looking forward border open again. Wait, know vaccines take normal deep freezer, household freezer?

Which vaccines?

That fantastic news logistics, especially developed world! Stay strong, Canada - friend south can’t wait visit we’re safe. % at? understanding saying know whether vaccinated people could spread COVID not, told everybody continue mask wearing social distancing got data. Since then, seem studies show vaccinated people spread virus. sound like fucking idi\_t.

Of course reopen schools Nah man students even worse. student body we’d online would think giant petri dishes storehouses covid? Gov. DeSantis, that's who! theory solid vaccine. sounds like Russia can't make much (I'd assume returned-doses thing part that) seem like going huge help. 

Unlike 4 US vaccines use lock spike protein prefusion form, appears really important new strains. False equivalence  even remotely thing. Think comment. they're mad fox calling election Biden won. personally know anyone suffered second shot prior COVID positive. circle side effects first shot zero second. Yeah, caught everyone surprise. Fortunately shot administered hospital setting able help immediately much face face training think needed actual injection aspect?

I wilderness first aid class, think covered two hours, maybe one.

Glad they’re letting it, man 20 hours nuts. he’s right though, can’t/shouldn’t relax 4 weeks 2nd dose, wouldn’t spell trouble? doubt many people waiting 4 *weeks* second dose begin going stuff... DeSantis? mean, Florida, completely middle road covid deaths, despite old population? Stay hydrated. There's way prove vaccination everyone quarantine. case state requirements entirely unenforceable, though. Slovakia EU country, would say pretty westernised. ahead. 2 weeks. maybe could scheme Taiwan Singapore S. Korea, places extensive population databases &amp; national health care, would nearly impossible United States state fiefdom. It’s nuts. They’re requiring that, like said, it’s hard complex skill teach.

If wanted to, could absolutely teach short class volunteers, supervision. say Uk infections drop 60% amid vaccinations.

Lockdowns didn’t appear shit vaccine came along tbh. reference, Queen Elizabeth 94 years old. (Or says...) worth loudest ones speak us. wish luck coming months. always considered Canada best ally.  can’t smoke public places...is violation rights? protecting everyone else’s?

Also, don’t rights (at least US) freedom consequences actions. person doesn’t get vaccinated, could contribute extending pandemic infect others (including people vaccinated people can’t get vaccinated medical conditions).

You right remain potential disease vector, rest us right stay away you.

There’s constitutional right get plane enter store take cruise, I’m still seeing point.

Edited spelling anti-vaxx. religions specific vaccines use fetal cell lines. Catholic Church said Catholics preferentially get Moderna Pfizer fetal cell lines used development whereas J&amp;J used production. Although still okay get J&amp;J options.


(Preemptively asking people downvote answering question. I've already gotten vaccinated myself.) insignificant, point was, dependent. 


As said never expecting 5M. given us knew we'd able use prior expiring. Can't really fully vaccinated cruises without vaccine passports equivalent mean, really doesn’t take years medical school teach someone give intramuscular shot.

Could teach anyone hour so.

There 2 motivations buy Sputnik.

AZ deliveries slow (think 25% target)Government order enough Pfizer/BioNTech could EU procurement scheme placed way much trust AZ. Got Pfizer vaccine yesterday, young underlying conditions, qualify due indigenous status. Arm sore I've chills body aches today fatigue, nothing bad. suspected mild case covid last spring worried would worse side effects this.  Right child goes class 7 days 8 hrs wears mask 24-7 cause get get everyone sick. 


Nothing alarmed over. 

Who cares get sick.... students eat cafeteria grades different times. grade’s lunch goes early 10am. enough social distance. 

Our elementary middle schools newly built building. current high school building built 1960s. new one construction. I’m sure ventilation good high school building. seems fine. 

Our remote education seems great too. It’s Google classroom organized. Students required log class regular class period. Parents easily check list homework/projects deadlines. classes synchronous asynchronous. Students opportunity every month switch remote snd in-person modes. still balancing act individual rights measured agsainst society right control body comes Roe v Wade. different thing. cant force people get shot arguably expel from. Certain parts public sphere.

But dont get ahold turn rights politicians bureacrats.

The real thing this... Anybody cant get vaccine actual health reasons put mask protect theirself.  refuse feel free get infected. easy conpromise made without moral signing either perspective. Kiwis truly wonderful people.

And sane, unlike countries could mentioned.

This civilized society looks acts like. mean kiwi cricketers playing IPL stuck India now? People got complacent quickly end second wave. Luckily we're vaccinating much quickly now, vaccinated 1% today, supplies keep entire month. rate keeps up, we'll 40% first dose received April 30 since we're delaying second doses like UK. Oh man, parents still that. They're still convinced get covid surfaces  required yet. Mostly want lose workers. Hospitals even require staff tested regularly. dominant UK variant better protect P.1's escape mutation? UK variant taking bulk cases US, Canada Europe, I'm curious unvaccinated getting UK variant better immunity P.1 infected OG COVID strains. terrible adults. parent it’s devastating children. give flying fuck legality, want money.

Even people get sick die result.

This unrestrained capitalism looks like. Want more? they're correct unfortunately limited 2 sticky posts :/ try sticky comment daily vaccine thread daily discussion thread day moving forward! carai manin dissertou KKKKKKKKKKKK  Around 20M AZ (+15M Pfizer/Biontech), would mean roughly 1/4 AZ doses came India.

It bit hard find good statistics subject though, good source mind.

Dependent may correct word, amount coming India hardly insignificant either. I’m thinking Canada went heavy reactive rather proactive. I.e. lockdowns restrictions rather cranking vacc. think end US’s saving moment. almost completely neglected common sense measures, doubled vaccs. Almost 180 rest world. second shot usually bad one... unless already rona mean, states roll age requirements past 50. 65+, 60+, 55+, 50+, opened everyone.

Sure, vaccines safe, holding person's freedom hostage ""voluntarily"" take action exactly ethical, especially directly forcing people violation human rights. Virginia vary state. Anecdotally, 1 25-30 people know vaccinated asked single question employment health history. one person signed pretty early teacher show proof employment, know 4 5 teachers asked anything.

I got shot mass vaccination site nobody asking questions, checked ID sure appointment.

I would encourage anyone lie form anything easy surely lot people it. also claim overweight, smoker, number hard prove health conditions, etc. Half measures please nobody. Moderation amidst pandemic creates higher, painful fall failure. Diamond Princess 2, Corona Boogaloo. Awesome, feel fortunate district budget personnel implement that. bet sure rural school Alabama  ignorant take i've heard week. social distancing nothing Marxism Florida Man FALSE. daughter's teacher one day away getting second dose vaccine got really sick covid, make shit bc that's want believe Correlation imply causation. Cases grew restrictions lifted also vaccines introduced variants appeared. seem decided reason zero evidence.

The rest diatribe appears writing edification, won’t interrupt that. AstraZeneca apparently renamed Vaxzevria EU small amount have. That’s 95% efficacy rate comes from. know many infections vaccines didn’t prevent. think guessing number? Many kids bullied. kids blooming. Perfect? No. Worse? Better? clear. Nothing “really going on”. Nobody expertise field claimed wouldn’t mutate all, it’s considerably less prone viruses flu, proven correct. We’re well year covid infected substantial amount planet. Yet still small number variants concern, vaccines remain effective against. far we’ve actually fortunate mutations. evolutionary pressure viruses become contagious, there’s need conspiracies labs explain this. Looking raw numbers seems like Japan well. ~10k deaths nothing compared countries similar population, Japan lot high density population areas. would’ve expected like 200k deaths even impressed low would’ve been. Cool lying complications means people might believe now.

It ""we aware link"", line ""there link prevelance among people take AZ""

That's obviously false. Thank Trump initiating world leading vaccine roll Biden continuing train going. 🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷 highest death rate virus. already helped point we're vaccinating children. accounts make sense US doing. experts vaccines Americans die access seems like bad way go

And letting non-Americans die even higher rate better alternative? Binge drinking co-activity shit. Like camping, video games, driving work. Nah, credit credit due. OWS part Trump Admin, alignment (also big fan previous admin). Yeah, virgin pulse points fitbit another tracker, hard get full amount end year. overblown title... right, said *no* evidence, that's true. Well according guy ITT, restaurant germs didn’t make people sick even pandemic. let’s abandon hand washing live total filth. not...?

The scary part looked post history he’s cook NYC. May never eat restaurant. source morgue trucks used?

I searched “Texas morgue trucks used” Google found nothing. “when over”

For us aren’t blindly listening government phrase means government stops infringing individual liberty. Fortunately Texas mostly though fear federal government try implement ongoing policies like 9/11. also sympathy vast majority developed world governments don’t seem willing stop infringing rights anytime soon. y’all may never Governor Botox Perhaps many healthcare workers age retirement: least would hope healthcare workers retire point lifetime service.

They directly harms way, job, one death acceptable normalised.  yet cases going up. Probably 1 5 Americans say won’t ever get shot. concur. hope well! Yeah, ignore shit. first time find need vaccine go fishing resort, cruise, resort, anything actually like line getting it. lot (not all) like talk tough firm still get secretly. Offer 4 hours vacation $100 bonus would put name list today. get someone close actually gets hospital dies. 

At point still doesn’t matter anyway. months away getting everyone wants needs actually getting now. worry hold outs later year societal pressure solve that. Yeah, miswrote. meant operation warp speed. not? Life already pretty much back normal lot country. Vote fuck 2022, Michiganders. recent poll showed ""49% male \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_s get vaccinated""

You insert Republicans blacks blank. Vaccine hesitancy political position. much complex nuanced that. got Wednesday, chills two nights row, I'm sore af, laying bed two days, really fatigued. Justin Trudeau's mom Fidel Castro mantra Right Wing America Here's map - spots, sure would say state full them. far areas huge metros go, rest Michigan outside metro Detroit actually pretty full.

If compare Ohio, example there's tons spots state, even metro Cleveland (and lesser extent metro Cincinnati Columbus). Wow, &amp; thought bad. I’m sorry experience. Fingers crossed doesn’t end needing repeat thing. 

I got mine yesterday 2:45pm &amp; started feeling bad 8pm, went bed early still haven’t slept. nausea didn’t throw up. Terrible headache &amp; FAR worse night fevered chills &amp; body aches. temp got 100.8 &amp; since come down. Also arm hurt like hell night it’s feeling fine now. 

It’s interesting hearing everyone else’s experiences. Almost adults know, work friends least one shot half both. 

I can’t imagine place shot considered bad thing people outright say won’t get it. Hopefully time get 3 Michigan vaccines reducing spread enough prevent #2 Sounds depressing lot people’s favorite past time ragging America get salty America well. vaccine major side effects. know multiple people got really sick vaccine, I've covid test positive antibodies I'm getting vaccine...bc better safe sorry! US turned around Trump spent big money unproven vaccines last year earlier nearly every country. also reason Great Britain Israel well vaccination shirt, shoes, service. Near zero studies far shown vaccines work variants?

They less effective preventing symptomatic COVID. Still extremely effective preventing sever disease missing?

Between less effectiveness variants, higher virulence, populations vaccine acceptance significantly lower, imagine thing continue swirl years. concerning levels, completely gone even mumps levels ""basically gone."" CVS posts new time slots midnight. Check site around 4am. Use city/town name zip code. Try worry side effects. Think new TV thing buying. look 'most helpful' reviews, tend lean negative, help form idea product altogether terrible. gets lost 90+% people experience minor problems all. They're ones typically spending half hour writing review experience – they're enjoying product moving lives.

I encourage think vaccine similar way. *Can you* negative side effects? Certainly! you? Probably not, do, they'll probably minor. first Pfizer dose Wednesday, I'm competitive cyclist training races hopefully later year. next day little bit soreness arm. still went amazing ride.

I pretty nervous side effects taking commission days, none came pass. eat well, sleep well relax. accurate say know data. 

Like (and you) said, data come really looks like prevents infection/spread. What's herd immunity threshold, then? define required amount immunity push cases zero? number would consider “almost at” zero? country 300+ million people close zero tall order. Thank you!
I wish well second shot! Hopefully normal weekend haha!

Mayor Hancock says personal Thanksgiving travel mistake, didn’t violate ethics. home much can,” Hancock tweeted hour boarded flight (Apology advance crappy website)  Herd immunity, definition, implies cases go zero eventually.

Well, yes, no. think would call herd immunity overall population vaccinated herd immunity threshold even subsets population reached levels.

Take mumps. eliminated US like measles was, immunization levels herd immunity threshold. Mumps day day concern immuno-compromised individuals herd immunity, still see cases pop various under-vaccinated communities. think that's eased little. 

Lipid nanoparticles first approved use medicine three years ago, new technology. US, yes, given availability vaccine hesitancy, likely best approve az export all. Nz little covid, may also best wait. countries people would need wait months alternative vaccines death rates high, suggestion stupid people die covid wait vírus keeps mutating. Selective pressure.  Yes agree! travel work would honestly let someone punch head meant I’d safe, keeping others safe working traveling. hope don’t get bad I’ll put anything feeling kicking covids ass vaxxed homies Some, yes. Operation Warp Speed give money J&amp;J Moderna (among others) vaccine development. Notably, however, Pfizer (at least terms R&amp;D funds). 

OWS also get credit preordering shit ton doses across multiple manufacturers. need upgraded Fairness Doctrine. currently remedy broadcasters spreading flasehoods suing them. Ouch. Good luck! too, nice! three weeks shots longest 3 weeks life sure? cancer patients people illnesses encouraged get vaccine? IIRC, very, small fraction people supposed get shot. Unless slave still choice isolate  Im guessing streamlining efficiency governments strong suit. Last time checked, overall number like 51% Pfizer 46% Moderna 3% J&amp;J. J&amp;J approved later. constrain personality probably doesn’t get far life. here. fail see broader picture.  Good bye. give incentives Pfizer-Biontech keeps developing vaccine combat variants. 5 days ideal. symptoms 5 days use home test. still asymptomatic 5 days go get PCR. community health center. I'm pissed, half mind drive back talk them. Really good job president Trump get ordered literally google quote gave you, large group, tens millions. Got second shot moderna two days ago!! Feel perfectly fine! 

In fact feel better first shot deltoid tenderness. 

Now second one feel perfectly normal! It’s better safe sorry. mean c’mon now. Pandemic already actually. Humanity failed, endemic virus. first pretty easy. second tough. Congrats! course everyone different, husband site soreness got really tired first shot. slept 5 pm next morning! 

I heard second shot cause severe side effects hey, better COVID! always thought Americans Canadians dunking friendly spat like Norwegians Swedes do, 2020 changed mind... much problem colleges mandating vaccines. problem still requiring masks/distancing despite that. Confirmed, thing worked, able get shot! That's true lockdowns much shorter, European lockdowns lasted longer 3 total. Even states quarantine requirements announce airport speakers like reminder security unattended bags. I’ve never seen anyone checking I’m airports lot. Although maybe NY hardcore, haven’t yet, states like CA IL.

Do want information. Getting hard one thinking liberals believe. Dont care find details you. getting vaccine comes support going back normal life comes. idk case, study Brazil made healthcare professionals Manaus, maybe infected before, vaccine acted like booster? would CDC guidelines, clearly state risk, misinterpreted New York Times, misinterpreted public more, make foreign import unlikely? quite true-squared

Lots protection first dose would awesome. check thread throughout day struggle find  I've stuff since beginning pandemic! minus everything joints sign time slot weekend -- age eligible. become eligible next week. facilities state vaccinating whoever signs slot matter what. 

Is bad? Yes, costs closing schools denying kids socialization COVID much higher wearing helmet. Mask/vaccine indeed low cost, make sense. closing schools comes high cost, risk high enough justify it. what, Tell families loved ones dead injured relatives bid deal.

Where claim vaccine supply problems Germany definitely Jens Spahns fault.

Why? Agreed all.

We need survive next 4-6 weeks looking way way better. distance learning automatically mean internet many? can't teachers drop week-long syllabus Mondays kids check via phone call?

Many kids negatively affected lock down, fair say lost year lives. read that. Thanks chart. Yes, world need vaccine perfectly good one. 

I would say, coming industry, collaboration academia hard. We're used regulated document every step every process. aim always provide clean, clear data regulators. dosing mix early conduct study Oxford examples things can't happen.

In retrospect think NIAID kinda dirty going public turned minor difference results US study. massive PR hit.

Sadly press smells blood water falling find next story. first time public perception powerful science comes vaccines (eg thiomersal, Lymerix). thought natural immunity beyond 3 months getting infected, infected, possible still get infected another variant, hence spike protein vaccination important 3 month period. “A new survey indicates 31% individuals queried intention getting vaccinated infection SARS-
CoV-2.

According source, groups likely reject COVID-19 vaccine 

Black people

women 

and conservative political leanings.

The researchers led survey emphasize policymakers must find better ways communicating reassuring public effectiveness safety COVID-19 Well, you’re living right high transmission, it’d better get sooner rather later. AZ vaccine 76% efficacy one dose 2 weeks. That’s really good vaccine! know Pfizer/Moderna ones higher now, 76% year ago hope vaccine would cause celebration. don’t know Indian one. 
Waiting months get sorted US could mean get Covid waiting. you’re trying avoid that, wait? 

By time get US, we’ll info people got first dose vaccines don’t here. learning every day. you’ll pretty well protected meantime.

Also, US, it’s likely low rates transmission time get anyway. produced anywhere US? produced US matter purchased not, export. mention Israel allow vaccination people who've recovered COVID, 8% population recovered vaccinated, lot people care getting shot.

You see vaccination rates Top right ultraorthodox, bottom left Arabs, top left non Arabs non Ultraorthodox bottom right people.

Colors: blue vaccine, grey 16, green recovered. see vaccine passports useful international travel years. That's hope. Seems extremely rare me, say take chances children world. 

This sentence American bald eagles holding sparklers apple pies shooting its' margins. question is: cost precautions? Helmets masks/vaccines low cost. banning kids school high cost risk would need high justify it. fixed - novavax produced locally. Strength gains equal get used What’s bothered throughout pandemic lack clarity articles like this. point article kids getting asymptomatic mild covid spreading older people, young(as 10) people getting serious and/or life threatening covid, both?

My wife vaccinated 4 year old heading pre-school fall. it’s kids spreading disease that’s less issue case getting sick. think case things better fall, wish journalists experts precise explaining sorts things. knowledge little evidence people recovered Covid, get Covid again. far less symptoms first time around.

It would differente vaccine. Pfizer? recent news easy forget still lower per capita mortality rich western countries, notably US.

They catching fast though. per capita mortality much different (1614 deaths per million vs US 1726 per million). Brazil similar per million deaths per spain. would assume 3K deaths day, top next months. Stats btw: Yeah it’s crazy countries adopted strategy too. U.K. almost level herd immunity Israel even though Israel given 2.5 times many doses vaccine adjusted population size. 

The U.K. also benefits lowest vaccine hesitancy world. think older age groups (like 70-80 80-90) saw 90-100% vaccination uptake extraordinary. Well suffienctly studied like vaccines covid vaccine. fair, people taking right kinda testing rest us. covid vaccine rushed ""product"" I'm def want take it. know big corps care people (kinda like Amazon), perfect reasons people like blindly trusting people.

And taking vaccine change anything. People take vaccine capacity spread compared somewhere taken it. vaccine self, young healthy effected covid need take long term short term effects understood.

Felt fine sore arm today, feel like I've run truckload flu. Holy shit, could destroy reputation Russian medicine generations. faith now, damn. Yeah work software none friends school/college (not there's anything wrong that) interested do. started working areas cool get friendly people worked similarly interested it. Hey, New Zealand hospitals breaking point dozen covid cases, clearly take much. me? would morn son say, knowing seen even experienced long life him, sad, yes quite bizarre. Blatantly false comparisons *all* blood clots caused things, specific deadly blood clot caused vaccine. Tenet last thing saw. I'm super excited go see something big screen too. According people prior infections react first dose second dose, really respond actual second dose. study looked antibody levels, side effects, based would surprised side effects second dose. 350 million germanz ja? bad news Canada too!

I get complaints. Canada managed pandemic far better countries vaccination rate ahead wealthy nations.  zero domestic production vaccines.

Canada fine. Plenty people get flu vaccine, able go daily lives flu season. can’t mandate right approved emergency order. Public schools federally funded there’s that. Portugal dropped 95% 6 weeks. Continues waffle tell people minds... Meanwhile zurich, still 18'000 appointments left april. apparently, many elderly people unwilling get vaccinated. wipe X industrial grade disinfectant every customer.

Great, already is. lucky enough go teen. take long get one one could give shit Europe UK. Really get move on, find else, buy pupoy whatever. incessant cry attention good look. Serious question: given percentages, issue? Layperson here, really understand. is... serious. Chile vaccinated population Donovan. could explain second wave full force tso many citizens vaccinated health measures restrict lives. try make sound nicer are? However elderly large fraction deaths vaccinate first death rates drop. think defeats whole modelling thing got first Moderna shot week ago. arm sore two three days injection site. (The arm pain gone Saturday). day shot, chills felt extremely fatigued. Everything took immense amount effort energy. (I realized shower going rough day picked shampoo bottle stared five minutes). trying get work done (and failing), gave took nap. American living Canada, here.

I bought house Edmonton, actually little bit less would paid Salt Lake City. certainly heck lot cheaper Austin, grew up.

You're probably thinking prices Vancouver, absolutely insane. # Update: deliveries get cut half

They made mistake liveblog, corrected. seems like Flanders (Dutch speaking region country) receive 50.000 vaccines, always expected. newspaper assumed Belgium, would meant significantly less Belgium. contrary, first delivery seems pushed ahead week. first vaccines delivered next week already, instead week that. Normal? No, normal.

It may also related vaccine. People sometimes randomly get bloody noses. accidentally scratched nose fingernail (I done :&lt; ).

Just keep eye out. continues, call doctor, like anything else.

How old you, curiosity?

I got bloody noses young totally random number times, one years. Annoyingly, grease-trap mandates go away May. We're going need higher vaccination rates, also depends state.

For example, California Vermont put end date damn things.

Your friends' paranoia kind justified. states definitely try keep mandates long possible. mean...if immunity doesn’t last long, explain Israel. make stuff up?

The defense production act used things like corning make extra glass vials Merck use facilities produce J&amp;J viruses. got shot 2 last month, im fully innoculated Look, eradication ship long since sailed. virus always us. Yes, there’s one million (probably even less, tbh) chance evolve completely escape vaccines planet reverse immunity make people explode. hasn’t really happened before, least nobody ever provide example virus completely escaping vaccines, let’s assume it’s possible. I’m going hide forever extremely small chance. would rather die that. people talk like social interaction “some inconvenience.” It’s not, it’s major life altering thing. shouldn’t things like extremely small chances. people vaccine, we’re done, that’s best it’s ever going be. never spread all. maybe taking stupidly small chance giving somebody sniffles order friends see grandma makes abstractly selfish. Well, fun that. fun bubble you’ll live long sterile life fun sin. that’s you’ll end want zero Covid. Would disagree, need saturation period even available.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* end getting it?  Yes. are/were manufactured Melbourne domestic supply. yeah real pain find Yes, that's science works.

We know test something.

Most likely would first two shots people. Something somethings genetics. 3 family member took 2nd shot together. got fever exactly 12 hours later.  mean really, need start putting end dates restrictions. California, Michigan, Vermont, Utah given end dates based cases vaccination amounts. People would probably trust approved EMA like vaccines. state, schools still required temperature checks. feel silly them, hopefully parents understand. Agreed 

It's clear need kind PR guidance Fauci Walensky tend communicate public really poorly pressure need advisors Yes! miss using reusable bags.  Great article!

The reasons, mostly unfounded, still make lot sense. 

Paranoid side-affects, whether it’s safe, allergic reactions. 

You right though, adoption &amp; acceptance moved ton. good though.

Based main reasons, get muted people know get vaccinated fine. 



“By far common reason people cited might get vaccinated, late February AP-NORC survey found, concerns possible side effects, 57 percent majority named among top reasons (people taking survey allowed select multiple options). followed 48 percent said waiting see safe, 45 percent said didn’t trust COVID-19 vaccines, 30 percent weren’t sure vaccine would work, 28 percent worried allergic reaction 27 percent said believed people needed shot more.” mandates go away we've gotten almost everyone fully vaccinated.

So assuming keep high vaccination rate US, mask mandate probably go away fall.

The US third population vaccinated 20% fully vaccinated.

The UK Chile around US.

For countries, might take longer. Possibly significantly so. depends local vaccination rate.

TBH wearing masks big deal, really something I'm fussed about.

And yes, need vaccinate children well. 🤡🌎 1984 coming soon neighbourhood near you. handles grocery carts. often found crawling things like E. Coli, lot jerks wash hands. state Dakotas white celebrities come from. Don’t know anyone see but, dad lost taste/smell corona around 10 months. week getting second dosage Pfizer vaccine, said taste improving “way way better” used be. 8 months barely taste/smell, looking get vaccine asap. guys, still hope!!!!!😭😭 Psycho Yep, anti-vaxx. Enjoy wrong :) can't make mind. Earlier concerned high school kids getting new virus thinks safe major fail UK remember, tier system complete joke think strong evidence vaccinated people cannot end long term effects (recent studies found evidence many long-term cases people initially asymptomatic), selective exposure sensible. Personally, going see unvaccinated people indoors eat indoor restaurant evidence. would eat indoor restaurant used vaccine pass though. would also go theater vaccine pass system would otherwise. damn, quick google failed one. awesome I'd bet mask mandates go away cases go dramatically. Maybe get Pfizer boosters moderna doesn’t end tweaking reduce side effects. Wishful thinking lol. grievances AZ flat disinformation.

I'm seeing disinformation gattaca astrazeneca. 

There's clotting concerns, period, vaccine. Germany recommended women 60 (the target demographic clotting concerns) get different vaccine. also fair criticisms trial data. 

This ""anti-vaxx"" fucks sake Second Pfizer nasty. first bit tired achy ok next day. day 4 got works. Fever, chills, horrible body aches, diarrhoea nausea. Heart rate 20 points. Panadol made difference all. Fever next day fatigue acid reflux nausea lasted three days. Sleep like dead vivid dreams. 

Not felt ill decades. need annual boosters see lit people skipping due severe side effects. hope reformulate them. Okay def know those. excatly vaccine help stop spread it? Moderna round one back December. Shot one felt like tetanus - sore bit went away. Round two different story. mine around 2pm. Went home, felt ok arm sore. woke next morning feeling like low blood sugar. ate, coffee, felt fine. Went work, ok noon. Started feel like shit sure due shot work PITA day. left 1, went home, advil pedialyte, bed. Slept around 3 hours, up, advil pedialyte, felt ok. Within hour back old self. coworkers two days. daughter far after, fine except sore arm. Shot two 2 long days vomiting, headaches, etc. coworkers age group felt way. first Moderna shot almost month ago second dose Monday. took ibuprofen first dose okay take Tylenol instead? hope mess effectiveness shot Link research showing ""very, very, common"" long term complications kids? also issue recently BNT/Pfizer could stored (except short periods) specially cold freezers physician's offices have. 

This another reason AZ seemed like good bet. way hell Covid vaccines mandatory school attendance 2021-2022 school year.

There simply isn’t time. isnt bad considering zero domestic vaccine manufacturing cant get kind infrastructure running year.

It's going slow getting there. time tests? spot on.

My doctor hasnt read new medical book since 20 years basically idea even doing. also downsides organization like CDC changing recommendations real time studies come out. recommendations huge impacts businesses organizations country flip advice back forth would large downstream effects well making people doubt credibility. Washing hands little downside benefits even doesn’t much fight COVID. adults able walk pharmacy get shot day, time end restrictions. ... wait another month vaccines offered everyone wants resuming normal life. J&amp;J also concepted two-dose vaccine first, thus 60% effectiveness

source? What? Positivity rate nothing deaths either lol. know, ""unintentional deaths"" actually spiked last year (hint: overdoses included China suck dick. would cool sometime soon could offer masking reason get vaccinated. like hit like 60-70% vaccinated, could say ""Get vaccine, stop wearing mask"" get last people fence get vaccine, although probably work, people would probably lie anyway.  seems fairly balanced view pandemic.

Is allowed sub? Isn’t everyone? many people team days 20 dress right wtf? Canada nowhere near thanks joke prime minister maybe 2023 right, 200 million. November.

After 300 million deal Sanofi (in September) fell through. 
Yeah that's said: need ride next 4-8 weeks brutality VOCs. Logistics US really well, shouldn’t surprising distribution successful. Mistake wasn’t caught plant made it... caught after, mean post QC temp check every visitor coming buisness. 2 IR thermometers vehicle. One dash sun one centre console. want get rid real quick zap dash one always reads hot sitting sun. works like charm. Yes, Wuhan-H1 D614G variant prevalent US accounted vast majority cases since June 2020; almost guaranteed represent bulk Pfizer Moderna cases well given timeframe studies conducted. great J+J provided data, allows us accurately compare study prior studies without speculating whether new variants factor.

If trying identify right vaccine family, probably also consider J&amp;J's criteria excluded ""mild"" cases COVID-19, Pfizer Moderna included efficacy numbers. 

Pfizer also reported updated data spanning full six months followup, confirms efficacy greater 90%:  

Notably, 9 cases they've seen far South African trial participants, placebo group - strong initial indication Pfizer vaccine protective B.1.351. I’m human. it’s tragic child could die reason, can’t morally outraged every dead kid planet, can’t live life basis edge cases. Probably millions kids Covid, 271 die, especially considering spread drop out, I’m sorry, it’s worth it. kids need 100% live lives. never kept inside diseases killed odd edge case. I’m dismissing poor kids, all. deaths tragic terrible. it’s like live every day symbolic memorial religiously avoiding constantly shrinking risk factor killed them. kids, nobody would drive cars swim fly go playground. that’s pretty sad life live. depends long takes get everyone fully vaccinated.

I suspect many schools require everyone get vaccine go back school. Seems like misread part wrote word ""causal""? 

[Nothing said AZ factually administered half dose vaccine rigour scepticism reproduction results. I'm happy receive Pfizer Moderna vaccine, incidence 60s females blood clotting higher group.
 
As per repsonses user; clearly interested debating anything, reading sources. throw accusations argue opinion yours. don’t want sound like I’m beating older study, issue definitely moved fast. [This article shows quickly numbers shifted across agree groups definitely ones target future pro-vaccine push, hope gut right 75% adults children. get there, mixed immunity Covid before, might get woods finally! Iowa, disappoint.

Your pathetic governor's response contributed death grandma covid.

My parents visit different state get vaccinated.

Try harder. article sounded like pharma companies want let wording go liability protection. Maybe giving permission sell doses might change minds though. TD fully vaccinated today! Got first shot Pfizer three weeks ago, got follow today. Went mass vaccination clinic times happy camper.

I feel like unlocked achievement here.

ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED:

**Dodged Virus**
*Got pandemic without getting sick* Size really excuse dick someone, even batshit crazy gun loving neighbor. Wonderful examples! Forks shoveling food mouths, typically. Thanks! average human 60,000 day. 75% thoughts believed negative nature. Whether bravado allow admit not, everyone lives fear. difference whether use strength allow destroy you. find ways cautious part help getting finish line empathetic way (still wear mask distance possible) another drunk driver saying “It’s right drive drunk” ***not*** licking butt. Hard give much credit Trump admin pharma companies put PR saying “still haven’t orders, stockpiled vaccines preparation it” leaders trying blame pharma lack vaccines hand - completely disorganized mess last year was. lame need coin word teenage redditors get condescending matters business talking about.  also heard new strain. Plus end year colleges, kids head home apparently worried spread (this friend lives there). works anywhere US l expected us flatten curve, crushed! Vaccines work 🙂  could sworn said last year. Who's whining? people responding survey, in, someone asked it. hardly blamed answering honestly. Yet say shit like office workers wanting improve working conditions ""billionaires say[ing] ferraris available collect"". touch reality think even close thing. Also think mechanics working asses office workers aren't? (There's nothing wrong working mechanic way, they're saps.) bunch miserable office workers improve lives without hurting anyone happy world becoming slightly better place? We're together. entire workforce going WFH. office job want, others WFH jobs want. one way other. There's room both. website, sends text much simpler. put info get text there's opening. Finally good article Vox. Realistic. almost over. THIS!! interesting see gradual change daily thread topics. now, gotten much hopeful

Besides, like reading different people different reactions virus. young women talking experiences prepared feeling well, managed prepare Still provide source stating vaccine effective P1 variant 🤔 website refreshes third party websites texts there's opening keep refreshing, check out! Come conclusions. I’m simply saying okay continue asking questions complex situation.  even military requires coronavirus vaccine emergency use, fully approved FDA. read article complaining X US, can't assume X problem elsewhere simply reported elsewhere. that. ships registered foreign countries private business entities. require vaccine boarding want to. DeSantis authority there. I’m fully vaxxed don’t ware mine outside unless I’m crowded downtown area. Hypothetically, would happen received doses Pfizer vaccine fully vaccinated February? Would nothing happen me? Really? companies perspective could lazier, less interested employees want work home slack off. got 2nd dose today (Moderna), it’s couple hours since went blow nose blood came out? blood wasn’t runny coming nostril, nose. normal? military personnel learn intramuscular injections basic training? friends told stories bruised purpose times.  ....go on? like things say sure come explanation. please explain. Perhaps right, entitled opinion equally entitled mine (whether incorrect not).

My opinion based low case numbers emotions. DeSantis issued executive order saying business Florida may require proof vaccination, employees customers. 

Cruise ships, board passengers US, must proof.  CDC let sail, soon safely. everyone onboard vaccinated, safely. then, cannot.

As far concerned, DeSantis created problem, willfully intentionally. fix stroke pen, retracting executive order. depending individual's risk COVID (their age, comorbidities, potential exposure), AZ vaccine becoming almost risky COVID, vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) nowhere near risk. yellow card report last week risk 1 million, latest report, closer 1 125,000 young age groups. There's also concern healthcare professionals looking issue, incidence rate may yet increase further. better vaccines AZ, trouble supply those. Spot on. didn’t. words, could’ve done much groundwork. common knowledge summer 2020 several promising vaccs development. Yet USG states almost nothing prepare national vaccination program. (the UK) sent 700,000 doses Australia. EU already sent Australia 1,000,000 doses 3,100,000 planned.

The EU, even export controls, far us exporting vaccines rest world. companies going keep paying city rates goodness hearts? amazing genes. I’m sure would like find out. getting immunity COVID worth feeling day Nowhere locked down, anywhere. Certain businesses closed. Everyone allowed leave house go someone else's. long lying sign nothing wrong jumping it. areas covid rates particularly high lot people refusing expanding eligibility early specifically shots go waste help boost herd immunity. week ago place near lot cancellations able go walk despite eligible standard definitions. people like walked would throw bunch vaccines. great friends Canada. Much love folks stay well. Note delay 15M J&amp;J/AZ vaccines accidently screwed Emergent Biosolutions. J&amp;J far behind order deliveries due fuck yeah, please come back keep apologising inept cretins.

You're ridiculous. keep acting government focus one thing maybe looking legal ramifications private company storing toxic waste running maintenance point 

Sounds like job Department Environment. Moderna one problem (mildly sore arm). 

Just got number 2. Going heavily hydrate see goes. Trudeau screwed getting vaccines closing borders, case closed. Reddit loves pass blame onto Ford though. thread 90% got shot feel that. Thats simply true, conjecture im assuming based reading lot nonsense AZ gets posted subreddit, sad many also believe that. find scientific reliable source says otherwise, welcome try.

Getting AZ rule getting alternative vaccine later all, vaccines already mixed without issue.

Sure day given range vaccine options pick one want, one want always bigger risk wait. Well, let’s trust science science hasn’t done yet children. Science doesn’t mean works adults give children forethought. That’s give vaccines young people AZ old people, possible. Since young people spread covid average more, higher efficiency mRNA vaccines also help slowing spread extra benefit this. 

I also wonder comparison considers risk die covid non obese 20 years old person without underlying health conditions even lower, shifting risk/reward calculation even AZ. sure joke saw flyer warehouse rave said “hand sanitizer available” 🤦‍♂️ Yeah funny tech world everyone saying amazing employees leaving SF. companies going take every opportunity drive wages. state US locked past year? Ultraorthodox Arabs vaccine hesitancy. seculars too, far lower rate little, states offering free therapy teens? Got J&amp;J shot yesterday, April 7th. side effects besides sore arm. Slight aches going sleep evening 7 hours later.  


Couldn't sleep well night, achey. Woke morning feverish achey. Slight headache day. terrible certainly amazing feeling. underlying conditions me. Yup. Getting second dose monday. friends eligible scrambling try get shots, unsuccessfully. next step waiting til they’re dosed. One week time guess. don’t disagree you. get p*litical sub fear ban think U.S.’s decentralization harmful lot levels. really first suggestion could think following original comment’s criteria.

I still think local health departments better funded, like said, also don’t think primary issue centralization. unfortunately think central entity case vulnerable political corruption. think parents high risk children/at risk children anxious get vaccine them. time that, see problem schools fully reopened. time India tried sterilise lot population.

An appalling time - here. got J&amp;J 2pm yesterday noticed symptoms last night I'm really starting feel it. past hours things really escalated. complaint. expected. immune system basically running emergency drill. way I'm almost glad feel working. reassuring. Way better Covid. God forbid read side affects prescription meds on! hiding bed. doesn’t make sense, based data, countries like Germany suspending use vaccine everyone 60. Mar. 26 - 44.6% / 4.9%
Mar. 19 - 40.3% / 3.2%
Mar. 12 - 35.5% / 2.3%

I included several weeks, since there’s delay first dose onset immunity. also included first dose / second dose numbers. “Specialists primary care” contradiction. pediatricians primary care providers. pediatricians primary care, *not* specialists Ontario literally went lockdown. He's psychosomatic (that boy needs therapy) That's I'm wondering. Good either way, gotten one months ago. get shut society kinds socially undesirable behavior. Lots behavior criminal, even though harm hard quantify. 

Murder socially undesirable behavior. stealing. Plenty “victimless” crimes behavior society decided tolerate too. Speeding empty road doesn’t hurt anyone, get fined, places get jail time it. mean, view human lives dispensable age, that's *your* generational issue, *a* generational issue. Worth it!  people to. anyone informed risks of... gasp... getting car?? Wait til find out! stuck house able gather friends, play outside

When this? Let alone doctors giving kit covid (Azithromycin, chloroquine, ivermectin, dexamatasone, vitamin d, zinc) everyone. Oh know that’s etymology manufacturing still follows  There’s really much do. don’t think people realize scarce resource mental health care actually is. think timing lot feeling. said Easter, B.1.1.7 variant running wild midwest.  variant much transmissable+covid fatigue+a holiday. think anxiety justified. Okay please tell wrong could learn...instead that. Got second moderna shot yesterday, started feeling sick around midnight, still feel awful 18 hours later. Fever bouncing 100-101, hot flashes followed extreme chills constantly, extremely achey muscles joints, pounding headache.

These side effects joke. taken painkillers, trying tough out. Hoping last much longer. hear good hydration first line defense severe side effects Yeah, kids personal me. living normal life all, school, schooling home, stuck house, able gather friends, able play outside, able normal stuff parents, able play sports participate clubs, wear mask.. know.. normal kid things. Pretty close locked up. peak special though. elderly even still exist there? good job crushing wave getting control. low amount deaths people know this? feel like general knowledge almost year now. Interesting CDC data 77.0% 65-74 76.7% 75+ shots. think means hesitancy problem yet, navigating online systems older folk/accessibility shots. ahead, nationwide centralised system vaccination, national health service used vaccinating 1/4 country 3 months every single year, list goes on, mainly centralised system already place across country. explain exactly attorney general handle leaking lakes?

Oh know, maybe looking legal ramifications private company storing toxic waste running maintenance point government step sort goes shit! know - maybe actual job elected (and paid handsomely) do!!

But yeah, please come back keep apologising inept cretins. Except Europe too... go. 

Highlights point, it’s absurd act like catastrophe.  Australia NZ still going zero COVID, opening Israel could quickly lead unmitigated spread among unvaccinated non recovered population. Israeli cases low, still far zero. Perhaps hit low double digits new daily caeses. Say don’t know anything science without actually saying don’t know anything science. 🤙🏻 study Brazil includes both. People one shot, people two. enough info separate now, seems. What's interesting similar rates drive clinics. Wonder get pharmacy typically walking browsing wait 15 minutes end bringing BP/heart rate enough counteract lightheadedness/dizziness seems like generational issue.  going bit rough month numbers wise, vaccines finally getting rolling groups, especially Ontario they're finally hitting hot spot regions vaccines going make huge difference Sleep little easier, fumble 1 yard line... immunity booster shot coming, fellow humans still building immunity Agreed. Stay home rest life want. don’t tell do. Huh? MISINFORMED 

The 3rd wave peaked 250,000 cases day. nowhere near today. depends are. live, still limited 50+ exceptions certain preconditions, essential work, etc. open adults next week. 600000
Germany: 600.000
US: 600,000

1 divided 2
Germany: 0,5
US: 0.5 Ah yes, forgot rest world good following rules taking precautions minimal cases outside America.

I also forgot rest world remain lockdown children vaccinated. That’s interesting covid pretty bad reaction first shot, really mild symptoms second supposed worse! Which, whatever, I'm usually pretty own... except starts shaping public policy.  Maybe way one's body reacted infected COVID indicator 2nd dose go? exactly MHRA EMA said. develop blood clots would likely rough ride covid. understand engineered fear, look blunt numbers, take away emotion, vaccine poorer world able afford. know COVAX there, going take years COXAV cover everyone Hand washing messaging virtue signalling deniers. kids locked up? link this? need see lol Pfizer used pretty much worldwide hope not. like things clean once. People addicted fear porn. call “big Covid people”. seen couple X lately. Nope, big COVID people. Ok guess won’t hanging anymore. like fact everything cleaner. goes show disgusting humans. EU negotiated better contr...nevermind. mention many schools incapable following CDC guidelines. Three feet? school, classrooms fill students sit close elbows touch. they'll taking masks eat, too. windows open rooms ventilation system remembers John Adams y'all listened, we'd back school.

So actually think make pretty fair point. two statements compute.

Building more, better, larger schools really anything teachers much state local budgets.

I agree teachers vastly underappreciated underpaid, there's much money go around. Yeah, politicians ass spend money spent, that's going since basically dawn time Uhhhhhhh Lol. Call anyone one opposes BJP bhakts . 

So virus spreading non BJP ruled states ? guess left namazi cool point fingers others others ignorants  think NovaVax approved first half year. NovaVax hopes receive approval May, completely depends FDA allow UK trial data used. Something allowed now, likely happen.

If allowed, wi probably take another couple months vaccine approved based US trial data, possible pushing approval second half year.

""Novavax targets May approval COVID-19 vaccine U.S. | FierceBiotech"" hopes approve NovaVax later month based UK trial data. then, friend comfortable, go? Unfortunately schools open part. cities MOH closed premier won't. 

I understand Legault obsessed curfews. province get covid easily 8 pm after.  No, fda say 100% effective reducing symptoms, 95.3% none all. 

Don't play games like til COVID lost taste smell two months. awful took unexpectedly crazy toll mental health. Besides able smell dangerous things like smoke, gas leaks, etc, able taste food bad. Also, already jobless (and entire industry shut down) pandemic, food one things really looked forward to. cook - work there's taste payoff? drank juices smoothies time experience food texture alone fun time all.

&amp;#x200B;

Losing taste smell ""real issues"" absolutely long COVID. Honestly curious Trump deserves credit scenario. still available 70s, health workers, people medical conditions etc.

And like going catch Covid next 6 months+ anyway Forget allocating places seeing surges. Allocate places demand is. cannot believe isn’t uproar forcing people drive 5 hours way get vaccinated big cities doses rural areas drowning them. It’s major public health failure. got first shot today :) local governments competing get vaccines faster. national governments taking charge trying distribute doses fair way. happen global scale. Countries agree UN new panel distribute vaccine doses fair way. 


It would messed every city town compete vaccine doses. messed countries compete other. distributed according need, according wealth. 

And importantly, patents vaccines removed. exact method manufacture successful vaccines public knowledge whole world, vaccine production could ramp way quickly. Netherlands says everyone vaccinated July 2021. Well, let's see that.    someone wants save lives something harmless kids, can't scar kids another year fear disease less deadly specifically flu. best friends grandma would argue, dead. Lol. found hard believe thus entire country lying . self hate racism . fair, would smaller percentage leadership let half million people die needlessly. richest, powerful country gets first dibs. Israel (1st), UK (2nd), Chile (3rd)? 


The US pass Bahrain April 2nd though take fourth place. Philippines, even hit 5% mark. Respectfully, see specialist this. cognitive behavioral therapy would probably help you. wish best. parent teacher small children and, respectfully, beg differ. They'd rather them, sure, far forefront minds. 112 means lived Spanish Flu young girl. literally witnessed history repeating itself. Novavax also still track approved US time month far know, really looks like won’t need astrazenecas all. source? People sub love shit Canada vaccine rollout really hasn’t bad. obviously can’t compare US everyone receive 1st dose end june story saw - reports need check another 62 million produced 150 February, workers factory run Emergent BioSolutions — biotech firm known producing anthrax vaccines — unknowingly cross-contaminated roughly 15 million doses Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine AstraZeneca's, permanently ruining batch, Times first reported. None doses distributed public.

Now 62 million doses Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine made factory since checked ensure also contaminated, Times reported.

If contaminated, also thrown out.

The factory — engineers vaccine bottle — produced least 150 million Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine doses total."" 50% people admitted hospitals 65. That's wolf packs work. leaders often allow sick, young old eat first. know many Canadian business closed, never re-open? got first dose two weeks ago, swear it’s longest two weeks life far waiting second dose. vaccines even approved kids yet. agree, definitely rising tide lifts boats situation. midpoint beneficial US ramp vaccinations outside US continue exclusively vaccinating population. virus spreads, higher risk get variations US protected vaccines. happens, fucked again. midpoint is, noone really knows, real debate centered moment policy wise, even comment threads Reddit kinda missing lede here. FDA says it’s 95.3% effective. Anyone cherry pick facts work like people picking data says 100% effective studies say different That's peak , started bottom peak. need test millions cases 10k months Wonderful read, thank you! Nope he's right, gravity subject forces chaos everything else. look small enough section space randomness produce extremely small areas entropy gravity cancelled reversed. Well, somewhat unfortunate, sense people might exaggerating slightly sort part ""in group."" We've gone hell past year, feel like people almost want vaccine trial fire sorts, say, ""I overcame it! I'm ready face world!""

I know much true, general sense get hearing people exchange stories side-effects work like veterans comparing old battle scars. people almost want one-up eachother describing side effects, which, said, unfortunate, vaccine skeptical people might hear turned off. Realistic way? even so, full immunity then.

I'm sure people happy risk anyway. everyone really wants vaccinated able to. got first dose yesterday; friend could grab appointment 20th. I'd barely squeak wire full immunity time, he'd miss out, even though really wanted vaccine. never ashamed Canadian.

LOL. ashamed 1 year pandemic infection rate first time surpassing US?

Have seen cold northern country much higher risk spread. much lower death rate Europe, North South America. Hell know people even know New York City alone saw deaths Canada. trump adminstration too.

For... again? Comments bleach light cloronique? Casting doubts medical community? Talking stockpiles exist? Withholding PPE states like? Two close friends J&amp;J symptoms describe. Totally anecdotal, heard consistent side effects J&amp;J vaccine. CDC's got nice trackers Chile vaccinating mostly Chinese quality vaccines rather gold standard Pfizer vaccine. people aware happening? know always easy would assume shit hit fan people know better hunker I'm kind baffled people already this. Every grocery store I've going past 3 years alcohol/sanitizer wipes door next carts. that's Southern US, people believe science mostly. counter evidence speculation 🤔 actually laughing first response actually think saying something profound.

Imagine calling someone arrogant someone *genuinely* trying helpful... exemplify arrogance laughing them. Laughing someone (in condescending way freely admit above) one obvious social demonstrations arrogance.

I laughing even slightest- seemed kind reasonable question kind reasonable person. mean guess ""kind"" certainly part it- I'm certain anyone reading would say far cruel exchange I. even *agree you* arrogant, citing shit information, sh*t, Sherlock.

This completely unnecessary. yet attacking human brain understand lockdowns (and pretty much everything pandemic) complicated.

Plenty intelligent people areas ignorance- fact do. try weasel re-quoting ""with brain"" part, pretty nebulous phrase. Information gave freely reply meant inform may considered nuances discussion- simply offered perspective. 

The condescension drips part quoted. almost *hear* tonal know people passionately pro lockdowns, work home financial issues.

I would argue this- like really- think point would insult Others lockdowns, believe seriousness COVID, need work jobs can't home. Brazil, COVID control president COVID denier. New Zealand, completely different story. S. Korea COVID control country's past experiences SARs MERs, additionally, lot general population scarred deaths previous outbreaks, mind masks contact tracing. Many Americans think wearing masks infringe rights. China completely different story altogether. African -Americans US tend vaccine fearful, due large distrust government medical intervention (because things like Tuskegee Study), makes hard vaccinate. different reasons country (state city) control COVID.

This entirely reasonable. fact agree it. say this.. *just fucking ignore comment already knew* rather *purposing* important part able connect people actually hear saying respond that, rather respond bunch crap want say think know much. one thing discussion person quite another windbag.

I'm aware replies trend towards concise, certainly apologize them: stand confidently behind position were/are offered good faith.

Did long-winded response prevent responding you? No. interested say well; though overly relevant, I've Japan love place- reasons responding. lost *nothing* simply ignoring response waiting theirs... yet *went way* insult me. Why?

Interesting attempt insult. assume means previous statement hurt antivaxx. Yeah, manufacturer vaccine got (Moderna) two weeks second dose written paperwork got. Crazy. Getting one Sunday. guess supply running low? told us inject bleach. helpful. Right? got Moderna shot couple weeks ago got chills anxiety trouble going sleep. 

Next shot 10 days. I’m going try get earlier first shot 7pm. figure away bedtime better.

If would’ve scheduled shots morning. 12 hours bedtime better idea getting later day. It’s happening Ontario. sure downvoting why? Vaccine side effects highly unpredictable individual scale; conditions cause one person absolutely negative effects vs getting absolutely floored two days (like did) pretty much unknown. 

Best approach would see symptoms come dose take Tylenol ibuprofen treat do. anxiety enough feel like take something anticipation symptoms showing up, you’re going hurt outcome long hold hours least.

I minor chills, fatigue, medium headache 24 hours. fever peaked 101F 8 hours. spent day mostly sleeping, watching always sunny, eating takeout. never got bad enough take Tylenol. arm pain EXTREME first shot. mild second shot, odd cause like symptoms first shot.

Right I'm 60 hours post vac feel 90% better, still bit fatigued.

If work felt like would 1/10 experience, took sick day 7/10 day. 

Would hearbeat. Dirty little secret... Everything covered everything. Yes, even house. fairly developed country actually. Chile lower rate poverty US. math certainly ""touch railing public park = 1/10k chance get COVID."" guess saying COVID positive person came touched shortly touched it, 1/10k.

The odds COVID positive person touching cereal box store, grabbing it, catching COVID certainly far remote 1 / 10k.

The phrasing CDC also ""less 1/10k"", actually unclear real odds are. 10k number pretty much useless put context around it.

This statement effectively CDC saying need wash groceries anymore. could shuttered worlds economy Wuhan started outbreak would’ve caused much serious longer lasting problems. None classrooms windows. guys windows? Bolsonaro special. Masks distance minor annoyance small
Children matter much adults act like kids don’t care. hope least people continue clean surfaces like tables, doorknobs, payment terminals frequently. Influenza spread touching contaminated surfaces. flu still dangerous disease kills hospitalizes lot people year. Things like masks, social distancing, yes, washing everything, decreased spread flu last winter. unintended effect call increased sanitation worthless ""hygiene theater"". people ruined doses going deep pit Hell it’s time. Kids go school required vaccinated whole host shit now. vaccine well. Anti-gazers home school get program like now. Yes agreed, ""southeast"" specific enough. Rural mostly deep south accurate. lack vaccinations counteracted lack population density, basically precautions anymore, B117 probably get exponential pockets month two. mayors urban areas—where majority state’s population lives—ordered lockdowns mask mandates.

For example, Miami lifting curfew. One throughout day, every day. people also taking one throughout day, every day. bowl diminish. like take one one time never again. course do. That's nonsense. Kids' lives filled minor annoyances keep others safe; drilled young age live community responsibility people –– adults brain-meltingly selfish slightly inconvenienced prevent others dying. Last year wave south started mid June so. depends whether vaccines going cover enough then. currently enough vaccines country hit 28%, conservatives premier fucking distribution That's lie, said distribution planning. turned mostly true, since plan 45 dump state  Nation whole (taken Google) lmao prioritising football players fucking teachers Maybe theory, went appointment NJ nobody checked residence. could anywhere. Short hypothetical variant basically Captain Trips, people done regardless vaccines point. Fuck Japan. I'm miserable here, since one first countries affected, taking generally seriously since week one, yet one lowest vaccination rates world.

It's sad seeing friends America starting return slightly normal life we're still suffering. don’t think post one boast god US it. That's great US getting vaccinations work out, part turning implied ""USA! #1!"" theme bit strange. article clearly states part theme US causing problem access countries. Obviously vaccinating 75% world's population going happen, obviously virus continue mutate.

I live Thailand barely started vaccinating anyone here. government's response input related bizarre say least, long story really go into. current known deaths Thailand still 100, versus half million plus US, recent third wave outbreak--started last week--lacks context necessity resolution.

The part that's complicated go versions vaccines, coming China Russia, soon India, degree uncertainty effectiveness risk. probably killing people causing serious side effects, one complication, made harder interpret since public bias hearsay detract clarity.

They cite article correctly. NYT article coronavirus pandemic arrived, factory became main U.S. location manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines developed Johnson &amp; Johnson AstraZeneca, churning 150 million doses last week.

So means 150 million doses total vaccines last week, 150 million separate J&amp;J, like BI claimed. includes failed doses, AZ J&amp;J doses. Later article explained breakdown 150 million doses, shared. Ok namazi. seems username hate glad see subhuman .

So, maybe good thing exercise options let companies use manufacturing countries? Or, keep ""loaning"" out. 
That said, still tons Americans get vaccinated. time might come escape variant whole world start over. millions unnecessary deaths.

The problem line thinking SARS-CoV-2 going become (or already) endemic. literally never stop ""simmering low level"" years; therefore risk ""it mutated handle"" literally never zero, implying restrictions like masking distancing forevermore us.

What's opinion currently relatively unknown long term effects covid, eg long haulers permanent damages nerves, brain organs even mild asymptomatic cases? potentially dangerous future children? nice. biggest problem vaccine sure effective SA BR variant. small trial showed around 10% effective SA variant. reason SA stopped using vaccine. see people saying hospitals, deaths. almost proof works significantly stop symptomatic disease, proof whatsoever stops hospital deaths variants.

We know works well old variants UK variant, Netherlands, SA BR variant already accounts 5% cases (UK variant 91%) three weeks ago. want family injected vaccine could possibly worthless 1 2 months. blood clotting huge risk, possibly effective couple months worries me. proof work symptomatic spread. proof stop hospitalisations deaths (against SA variant).

Edit: right clear benefit taking vaccine, cannot take better, effective vaccine later, worth risk vaccine deemed ineffective variant could dominant months? refusal give pressure focus solely age groups another reason worked well!

Nobody stopping think final wave US May/June southeast, B.1.1.7 running areas stop way short vaccine uptake. northern states barely (by weeks) escaping real bad situation, southeast seems setting poorly summer indoor AC huddling. downvotes? get someone poor country develop new vaccine resistant variant world screwed again! know who's downvoting true. Canada labeled threat US national interest US Govt Thanks, asshole. Got link? Genuinely curious one. Yeah, like that. US Federal Government treated Canada poorly recent years, NAFTA, NATO, Lumber, trying steal purchased PPE example. top that, closest neighbour worst pandemic numbers first world. justification it. celebrate \[the success vaccine\], ate entire box Goobers chocolate-covered peanuts. herself. 

This real. human incredible hero. Yet are. covidvax.live want mesmerized! covidvax.live says 70% mid July day date gets bit closer higher vaccines! Get 2nd shot Sunday can’t wait. Flying surprise grandparents summer got covid somehow survived. Haven’t seen 7 years. I’m changing soon possible. 

They fully vaccinated can’t wait hug them. gotta sign up. Congrats! great feeling. used blood samples people received COVID-19 vaccine developed Moderna vaccine candidate Novavax yet authorized use United States. introduced engineered versions viral variants blood samples waited see much infectious virus survived.

Is scientific article I've found actually tested Moderna lump together Pfizer? I'm sick seeing articles Pfizer lumping mRNA vaccines together without separation. old coworker Nova Scotia originally visiting elderly father. healthcare fully vaccinated since early January. Previous PCR test 10 days quarantine NS well PCR test border understand currently. known months reassuring people. paranoid grabbing items grocery stores, opening doors, tasks. Unfortunately, worse offenders restaurants opening capacity recommended. saw videos photos dozens people gathered small area mid-2020. really hope right.
I hate-love you.
Love, Canadian. Yes, stakes same.

Not sure people disagreeing with. complicated relations federal provincial governments mainly Quebéc something more? Vax would cranking out? everyone wants live city, 80% jobs city.

Even wanted live city, hard find suitable place, nearest station, expensive gets. want everyone do? pretend people still getting sick dying? want everyone get fucking shot get lives, many people throwing tantrums RIIIGHTS complaining strip cloth face grow stuck here.

I'm musician, teach college. able sing masked (it sucks) played flute public year directed choir. *my actual profession*. I'd like get back it. Instead I'm talking black boxes zoom. I'm willing get sick maybe die someone else feel better. can't fucking afford get sick. I'm primary breadwinner family. get sick family fucked. 50% province thinks lockdowns last long enough 50% think lockdown sort mythical reset.

BTW - US numbers ticking again, determined give us run money. right you’re sending kids firestorm spreading like wildfire. last order Amazon look like? Yeah! already washed 30 sec, Covid came. u know why?

CAUSE CDC SAYS PREVENT EVERY DISEASE! 🤣

But let's get back water rinse every time use bathroom. Cause ma' freedom. 🙄🤬 Intentionally spoiled vaccines would covered whole province. Bout get second tomorrow. Leveling bitches asked comment Gretchen said “nuh uh, are” What's wrong that?! can't wait four kids vaccinated. take anything till symptoms.. rode want kind anything else body thing...you really try same, bad. I’d rather BC Doug Ford’s clusterfuck. Countries don’t need try let er rip method plenty people exposed virus since early last year (or earlier). Many confirmed cases. Estimates 2x even 10x confirmed cases. Unfortunately, US currently now. tens millions doses expired due poor planning infrastructure. Also, hogging vaccines patents performing ""vaccine diplomacy"" certain countries access vaccine. makes sense geopolitical perspective sucks poorer countries South America, Africa, SEA. college students go private colleges Exactly.

Some idiots act like disinfectants work Covid. 🙄

Check Flu stats 2020! 🤣 thinks ""useless"" preventative measures lot positive community health effects. Even wiping doors prevent Covid, Im still happy prevented horrible stomach flu. like get airplane tell case emergency secure mask helping someone else theirs. Germany also alot covid cases Aus, Sydney people pretty much act like covid exist anymore Germany also alot covid cases Aus, Sydney people pretty much act like covid exist anymore Indeed. Shit, beer drugs. It’s transmissible UK variant. unfortunately dominant strain US well. mRNA par discovery antibiotics.

The impact noticeable minor things like cures ton cancers, among amazing things. Ontario done serious shutdown. Schools closed, none necessary shopping,... BC today announced outbreak workplace team go either shut give guidance help prevent spread. shutdown effective Ontario's numbers start decline weeks.  hope BC's current restrictions even slow increase. saying that's great Canada's population even half Germany's ~30 times landmass, even granting lot one lives different logistical challenge.  can’t find now, read somewhere Canada’s vacc. rate currently 3rd, behind US UK. Pretty good country can’t manufacture own. 

Trudeau done good job be, given circumstances. husband wasn’t 10-12 hours got side effects. it’s really anxiety inducing take around 6-8 hour mark. Take ibuprofen that’s better muscle/joint aches Obviously obsessive wiping things general hygiene theater, stores periodically mopping concrete entrance too. makes big difference. Awesome paste answer haha People downvoting must delusional something actually believe go back normal soon. Nice, same. Well done avoiding virus, too. Idk I’m glad managed avoid ramifications despite couple close calls. Holly shit that’s fuck ton vaccines nothing. basement dwellers subreddit heard mean comments basement dwellers therefore every Canadian American hating lunatic. “Event organizers expecting 180,000 attendees nightly, represents 90 percent approved capacity 200,000 day.”

Masks mosh pits? Lol. flu respiratory, too, masks distancing likely much larger role Looool thing Pfizer dose 2. Shoot aweful 10/10 would get shot again! Well haven’t proud country awhile restore faith. pattern covid. First shot worse  Taiwan, New Zealand, hell even China Much 2020. still lives home UK likely source UK variant. sequencing (by far) likely discover variants. clear little thought. 

Virus mutate that's fact. get deadly get contagious.

 thing mutations think ones spread better ones contagious heavy symptoms super deadly. I'm salesman I'm feeling sore throat sneezing keep week nothing infect plenty people vs staying home fever hospital isolated people line appear concept six feet apart is? interesting interview Bill Gates recently one partners working COVID vaccine offering patent. spoke fact quality vaccines actually fairly difficult produce, especially mass, giving away patent company guarantee quality could actually worse, eroding public confidence vaccines, harming people, still inoculating COVID.

I'm saying America necessarily nationalist attitude, think complicated simply breaking patents allowing anyone make them. America still always right - J&amp;J toss 15M vaccines - imagine smaller company make decision. never ashamed Canadian.

Yikes, hyperbole much? they? remember athletes surprised put toilet paper trash bins. 'denialists' - implying COVID deniers par Holocaust deniers. know language using fucking ashamed using it. think ate chocolate squirrel terrible analogy. Vaccinating residents first nothing support vaccination globally. starve truly vulnerable much needed vaccines effort focused getting children vaccinated wealthy countries. mistake paperwork. execute people figured best go Texas. never got note there... Australia's defense, afford miss deadline without much consequence. Yeah that's look it. throwing money scientists putting eggs one hail-mary basket &amp; proceeding nothing else, basically full belief hail mary 100% going work, Trump thing IMO. ahead 

Weird didn’t hear anything news resurrection machine bring back thousands American lives tossed away? ruled world... Stop sending vaccines states people don’t take them. Great news! feels liberating fully vaccinated well way. Get Tylenol something ready though. might feel like crap day. That's easy thing get blood test done check also use windows Microsoft products? Yeah... thats many doses sitting freezers. shit show It’s maddening many levels. I’m tired sadngry list them. can't even get vaccine yet city! Every place ""booked.""  April 21st coincidentally full immunity date (two weeks vaccination).

I'm assuming mask mandate dropped whoever wants vaccine get one freely. point anyone want get vaccinated welcome get free COVID want rest us move on.  Don’t 85% patients risk group survive infection? wouldn’t want odds personally, event 85% chance happening isn’t exactly “miracle.” power dynamic though. Maybe like Korea Japan. actually fair similarities four us. possible get second dose different state got first? replied to, believe poster implied COVID treatment costs paid get vaccine. someone get vaccine (or legitimate medical reason can’t), would covered. 

I would also tie unemployment benefits. lose job due COVID related reason, would get unemployment unless you’ve vaccinated. Government pushing sinovac. Although majority scared getting vaccine unless to. lot want astra. lot waiting Moderna Novavax imported private sector. July 31st current speed. J&amp;J actually delivers even faster. CureVac deliver Q2 even faster still. Basically, past days, PA reported ridiculously small amount doses. Science needs little time figure everything confidence. start preaching instead forgoing explanation live OK opened vaccines nonresidents week. Yep messaging terrible, also constantly shifting, vague, pessimistic. Fauci throws impossible goals like 80% population vaccinated (I say impossible vaccine approved 70% population), meanwhile Israel reached herd immunity opening everything vaccinated 56%.

It wonder policies different every state, leadership guidance use. Got mine Thursday around noon. Moderna. Still little pain tenderness injection site nothing major. slight head ache hours sleep fixed that. Overall I'm ok hurts lift arm way put shirt. normal I’m experiencing lot fear anxiety I’m recovering? marked contrast previous administration.

It previous administration put plan together. Biden nothing rubber stamp plan. People say otherwise fools. Onion 

The respected place truth Republicans. Even vaccines produced EU given, UK would still ahead. user responding copypasting comments every Reddit thread concerning Sputnik V Slovakia (and Brazil situation totally different, appears row local manufacturer). mindful level sockpuppetry concerning vaccine diplomacy absurd levels. mind Irland UK real enemies terrorist bombings. like Saudi Iran, two factions religion. FHM actually [legally follow evidence guidelines infection control
 Section 4 Infection control measures shall based science proven experience may far-reaching justifiable regard danger human health.
 measures must taken respect equal value human beings integrity individuals. What's going on, heard anything. nothing US surge Problem always lack available vaccines

yeah, that's root problems EU. ordered late enough. That's corrected right now, obviously production capacity (yet) orders made year.

BioNTech plans manufacture 250 million doeses newly bought facility Marburg Q2 2021, pull help vaccination Europe including Germany lot.

All problems Germany Europe lack vaccines. Delivering what's big problem, far aware. Yeah, Black Plague still exists.  dad 70 VA took forever get appointment 15th month, even take name. French would cry fetal position right right! got 2M first doses today No, would better evenly distributed.

There swaths south may achieve herd immunity. big pockets outbreaks. LFG!!! Yeah apparently seems massive shortage delays manufacturing vaccine.... seem affect America though. got second dose moderna yesterday fever 12 hours feel like covid. beating ass way worse first dose purely supply issue, would see countries performing similar way receiving amounts, facing supply issues. country significantly better worse EU average must something fundamentally different like importing vaccines Russia (Hungary), vaccinating incredibly fast (Denmark)... there’s Netherlands. Remarkable someone utterly repellant every phase adult life. worked US company great time everyone. like point numbers, too... missing since us big therefore many idiots, organize make bigger impact

And really, dislike us group people/country went mass vaccination site Northern Virginia same. showed line hundreds people long snaking around parking lot, amazingly, got checked got shot 15-20 minutes. volunteers getting people organized 50-60 nurses giving shots. must easily thousands per day. something get behind. Companies mandating jabs horrible, power mandate medical procedure threat unemployment. follow safety measures cases drop almost zero sounds reasonable. Another poster pointed out, last 20 years Europe saying keep stay world affairs. they're pissed we're that. 

@ Europeans, worry, we'll likely sending vaccines way soon despite hate. That's hopeful...... Employees already fearful enforce mask rule buildings let alone passports. Plus get fake passports.

There always anti-vacers. around back smallpox deathrate 30%.... intelligence officials completely missed Covid rampant China? Ooga booga.

Try reading adverse reaction reporting ibuprofen. I'm glad Brazilian. nearly everyone wants take vaccine :) one! find anything everything good enough. Best lowball prediction record much higher, even find something complain!

 


It annoyed end, saw comment couple years back. expectations complaining likly pushes us bettter.

Where US mantra ""America fuck yes, look great well EVERYTHING"" gives real reflection reality needs improve.

 


This self boasting vaccination levels fucking nearly every turn first year pandemic lesson enough thinking.

 


While Europe even shares vaccine outside countries desperate US closed every export. Germany would much higher levels vaccinations too, everyone would call dick move guess what... GERMANS WOULD COMPLAIN IT! 😉 approved 12+ I'm sure they'll move onto younger kids trials, already ... yet Israel reached herd immunity vaccinating 56% population. Math hard! Meeeeh feel like careful people’s lives line (as much wish weren’t true). sub changed much since start pandy hahah Please link study CI. That's crazy. feel like conspiracy theorists going field day one. media NEVER pushed ""12 days flatten curve"" narrative. fact honest said cancel big events, wear masks, social distance covid vaccine available get-go. 12 days really 12 months, people immediately jumped ""the media fearmongering virus lying people government wants control lives."" Switzerland fucked too. Last summer, government faced option invest Moderna facility exchange get first million doses. believe m-RNA vaccine pick it.

But now, lot doses expected arrive people want vaccinated fully vaccinated July. Last 20 years? like invasion Afghanistan Iraq? US export vaccines Canada Canadians like Iraq war...you think that's serious argument?

As policies mitigate spread, obviously, that's best. Even now, countries efficiently contained spread, like Vietnam, New Zealand, Australia, projected outperform even countries rapid vaccinations. course, best first policy contain spread. good policy counter spread Covid separate distribution vaccines.

Access vaccines Canadians artificially restricted export restrictions imposed US. US decided claim entire output vaccines themselves, expense everyone else outstanding orders would filled using output.

You're free say, fuck em, US responsibility anyone American. that's position, let's least honest it. Darwin theory people. week anomaly. 

Going ~1 million ~5 million ~1 million three weeks. big deal. Wall Street Journal didn’t survey whole country. It’s 8% respondents. also consider type person would read Wall Street Journal. likely view vaccine favorably? I'm way flu shot. used way getting flu one time absolutely changed outlook.

I'm genuinely surprised flu vaccination rates high -- 50% entire population almost 65% children. really gives hope Covid vaccination rates significantly higher even annual boosters, kind logistical nightmare. Interest free vaccine loan, that's pretty awesome tbh. Cry going around 70% fully 85% end month rate.

Beyond time open back up, definitely. got appointment last night Monday first shot Pfizer!!! I’m ecstatic What’s picture Deborah Birx thumbnail? want mandate vaccines without first antibody testing. Several Governors already made vaccine passports illegal. Texas, example. lol source one? CNN? got shot Javits Center. well-run operation. second wasted, get 20 minutes, includes mandatory 15 minute observation period. 

They must thousand shots per hour. Nice job National Guard. Truth, real cultural problem think. Anecdotally Pakistani friend's family pretty anti-vacc us govt failed proper lockdowns mask mandates seemed like europeans laughed us people dying. Observed study - 100%. Observed i. Real life among greater 100 million US persons - 100%. Stop spreading false information. Refusing AZ vaccine deadlier taking there’s variables in-play. Waiting 2-3 weeks get Pfizer/Moderna reduce chances death/sickness getting AZ today 

Both categorically incorrect. 

If AZ going require regular booster jabs mRNA ones obviously mRNA one rolled instead, immediately supply scaled enough world yet remember really puts herd immunity risk 1/4 completely randomly distributed across population. likely that? I'd say likely small pockets people get large pockets people will. Unless people constantly interacting one another much issue. Bottom line think pretty sensationalist piece many know expressed desire get vaccine already Covid. 
“U.S. intelligence officials little comfort offer pandemic-weary planet world heading next 20 years. Short answer: looks pretty bleak.” That’s kids 12 thankful Trump put plan place. understand point here. I'm claiming money rules.

Your claiming soft power rules, using money ruling example. mutated 20,000 times vaccines work variants. point safe say covid spike protein gonna mutate. suspected since beginning. pointed studies. insists I'm wrong. also mentioned second shot past literally laughed pointed booster required J&amp;J six weeks out. told 100% wrong dug heels like 3 yr old insisted wrong clue talking about. ended disengaging walking away every brings wrong booster thing. really pisses gets skin. got J&amp;J two weeks ago. feel completely safe going back gym sit restaurant. Canada's healthcare system, publicly funded, far fewer resources per capita US, high occupancy normal times vs 64% US). difference ICU capacity even starker - Canada 13.5 ICU beds per 1mm persons, compared 29.4 True. problem organization side. Even couple months, we’re still averaging less 50,000 doses per day population 110m. govt even delayed initial shipments. Pathetic. Yet living life relatively normal without 500000 dead. know prefer. vaccine come (even better it'll Pfizer AZ). Anyone think public health messaging around vaccine kind pretty bad? It’s getting better start changing recommendations vaccinated people still. 

I don’t know it’s wording telling people even vaccine, still get sick whatnot seems wrong given data that’s coming out. keep seeing stuff social media people saying “just got vaccine doesn’t mean go whatever want. don’t wanna hear ‘bUt GoT VaCcINe’”

Once people fully vaccinated, recommendations start change. line better science, also would encourage people actually get vaccine. tell people get vaccine continue living life past year, people don’t see point getting shot. better chance still avoiding significantly negative outcomes even catch it. Bottom line - hell yes go hang vaccinated elders. Pfizer Moderna, working variant boosters. time. wanna finally get vaccinated. last at-risk people household, father, gonna fully vaccinated two weeks kick end May, assuming neither appointments get delayed due shortages. hopeful article Onion mistakenly taken truth satire. Please tell is! Vaccines enough 1/5th population = 1/5th complaints. Exactly. EU countries receive amounts, maybe delivery dates somewhat different, amount - absolutely excuse Netherlands lagging. 

Denmark ahead pack now, also vaccinating every dose get fast possible. haha. real problem right especially live Harrow, London ( extremely ethnically diverse) I've two elderly muslim women decline vaccine give thought conflicted fasting/ramadan rules. 

Unfortunately went home unvaccinated really quite sad. less 20 coworker sounds like total fucking loser. death rate covid among kids near nonexistent. believe NJ VA state residency requirements similar problem Mississippi, 
73,000 Vaccine Slots Takers Awww, cute delusions. Didn’t Conway say thing several times Faux news Keep shit There's good chance really get much higher case counts, couple things working us.

It's finally warning - dear God, finally.

Our vaccine supply steady, exceeding initial expectations. country 40 million, averaging close 2 million vaccines delivered week. 

Because went shotgun approach, end month we'll 4 different vaccines circulating systems, great one distribution issues. Johnson Johnson start month. Novavax, hopefully, next month one after. 

We currently 17% population vaccinated single dose, track double month, probably less, we're currently vaccinating ~0.6% population day (and ramping up). 

We've always pretty good keeping deaths case counts low via non vaccination mechanisms - make job vaccines easier. Especially start focusing hotspots, elderly. 

We really really high standards Canada - united States neighbors, want always beat match everything do. really realistic, part personality. world stage, countries well us, better trajectory. 

More good news could come in, continuously moved vaccine deliveries, United States stated they'd like start helping neighbors supply constraints soon.

If anyone curious, take look Canadian subs today - r/ontario puts comprehensive covid breakdown every morning around 10:30am est, r/CanadaCoronavirus gives pretty good summaries every day. anxiety inducing news everywhere Canada, unfortunately overshadows progress we're making. 

We're gonna okay. Better okay, even Children likely become eligible soon enough based Pfizer trial results I'm curious wait long protection lasts. don’t think it’s allergies? would bet people couldn’t tell difference slight cold allergies. you’re US it’s spring time allergies even likely. slowness usual vaccine development part due funding seeking grant writing, safety. Vaccine side effects appear quickly. Phase 1 participants summer 2020 still fine, vaccine safe. can’t mandate right approved emergency order.

As far I'm aware, that's settled law it? I've heard, would probably something ends front SCOTUS point would probably EUA. also want throw Wegmans northeastern United States Stay strong. praying something changes better Brazil soon. nice bar love patronize outisde LA. months lockdowns visited togo order spoke bartender running place. everything shut decided invest new HVAC system would help drastically reduce exposure. knew key thing, wiping things chlorox wipes.

A month two later closed shop notice open indoor seating city approving outdoor seating really weird spot narrow street main street old town district. Even things reopen still heard they've reopened worries/bothers me. week two first Moderna dose noticed arm medium rash (not bothering anything skin reddish) around shot area, l took ibuprofen dose arm starting hurt got experience side effect. Also took next morning preemptively, little hypochondriac hope ruin first shot. cranking vacc

Crank what? Canada little/no local novel vaccine mass production capacity. reliant orders nations prioritize citizens first. Got J&amp;J, fever, chills, fatigue 2 days straight. Husband got week fatigue nausea hours. got J&amp;J vaccine morning, 13 hours ago. developed fever 2 hours ago, taking Tylenol I’m back 98. take Tylenol prevent coming back? F@ck Communist Party sound like soupjuice!

It’s like get stolen  Since updated, poor wording website. live NYC I’m confused whether there’s New York variant. Everyone’s always anxious variants here. lot chatter Canadian Redditors sub less uplifting America response pandemic last year. Tragic Dear god, glad lucky enough work home fiasco Yes, J&amp;J also one trials include PCR testing determine efficacy asymptomatic infection, found reduction asymptomatic infection similar reported efficacy moderate symptomatic infection agree soon. still lot unvaccinated people recently unvaccinated people limited immunity. may cost lives.

You say twisting words, yet, wrote three whole ass paragraphs dedicated misquoting me. Well sucks. 2 weeks husband got first dose vaccine, first time sanitize wash groceries. liberating. Amazing year pandemic, people refuse accept reality situation they're in. Wow! Amazing! actually 13-15 million J&amp;J doses drain.

Another 62 million J&amp;J doses 70 million AstraZeneca doses. sure yet clear, going check J&amp;J lots again, possibly AZ lots well.

So 150 million Monday morning staff meeting plant, Emergent officials claimed mistake isolated incident media exaggerated significance, according person briefed meeting. urged workers proud plant accomplished short time.  quality-control managers required test anew every lot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine made plant — 62 million doses — make sure weren’t also contaminated. Another roughly 70 million doses AstraZeneca’s may also need tested.  inspectors expected intensely scrutinize plant certifying release doses public. remains uncertain whether would occur time Johnson &amp; Johnson deliver 24 million doses promised ship federal government almost completely neglected common sense measures

This pretty much states, states quite responsible, actually. remember visiting rural Pennsylvania last summer surprised see everyone wearing masks, even outside. ""Trump country"". moderation = Canadian Yep, friends drive Quincy last month. 5 hours one way!  Help convince friend everything's fine. mom fully vaxxed already covid, got exposed covid twice recently, week ago, another four days ago. He's partially vaxxed already covid, getting second shot next week. mom symptoms. wants quarantine. told need to, he's pretty freaked out. ‘Now allowed’...there problem, want scale success measured volume...maybe keep gate keeping elitism out, time spent screwing around phases websites ultimately crylaughed at, hospitals know vaccinate employees, that...make line right front roll selves schools still masks BC. piss weak public health officer wrote back patting book first wave without implementing enforcing anything. Oh allowed wine tastings keep happening, conflict interest owning winery. Fuck hate province. Theoretically can, said good behaviour enforced supported. leadership interest enforcing supporting us, punishing small businesses taking brunt burden pandemic end sight. Toss us couple paid sick days pandemic fucks sake least get tested instead coming work sick can't afford to. getting downvoted, Canada totally realistic. Idk think people read much things. it’s likely true average people covid react worse first dose better second dose/older people generally less side effects younger it’s exact science wide variation reactions. real answer one knows sure certain people react way verse others honestly doesn’t matter much likely.  ask proof vaccination Yeah, first Pfizer dose last Saturday. I'll keep quite careful next Saturday, careful another 3 weeks. 8th May done this. initial effectiveness vaccine 3% goes 56% dose 2. spend almost every day wishing teach like normal again. school closed temporarily two positives. Trying hang there...the vaccination news looks good, god damn hard hang sometimes. reversal fortunes. old remember sentiment subreddit Justin decided keep border closed months. Chile posted highest total months despite good vaccine rollout, make sense... C diff. sure, I'm hoping companies go ""punish bad workers"" approach rather ""screw it, can't leave people unsupervised"" approach. I'm curious... dick States...? Everyone know Canada straight worried suffering Americans, gloating anything. response prior administration trash talking, American people themselves. Covid November. Could PCR test still pick virus way back then? decently sick then. Yes originally set alert level almost year ago. that's gonna happen 2022. I'm sorry, kids actually ""high risk"" actually are, stay home. feasible keep 99% home protect 1% hope get rid soon Bolsonaro bullshit. Uh, gonna ""normal"". masks gone Fall. seems well now! Alberta 800 cases last Thursday, today 1400.... Things getting bad here. Nope No, feeling “fine dandy” Also think vaccine kids important many parents.

that's happening 2022, parents want one right make kids mask distance. simply impossible praise country without simultaneously bashing US, warranted not. Internet. don’t fucking care. people known pre covid people travel go shit supposed sick time. sniffles. times something serious flu even worse times may something like MRSA fuck pregnant lady.

Just like driving privilege within society earn upkeep, sharing space within society. health concerns sharing spaces, absolutely becomes issue start vetting people. work hospital directly covid patients may instinctively view POV naturally. ~3 days  never ‘locked down’. know why? Governor state went along idea job carpet factory essential. 

Carpet. 

We worked all. Never even shutdown deep clean.

Millions people went work every day. daughter face face school year. Vaccine hesitancy *much* stronger France US despite Internet's assumption everything worse America. that’s true *right now* too. 2 weeks, today gotten 20 deaths filled in. worry, herd immunity right around corner  got second Pfizer dose. Get fucking level ho Blows mind people countries really thought could beat covid good behavior. almost always bleed little shots. Never big deal though. ain’t shit till variant! ass taste Texas?  could agree more. control maaaan government microchips tracking dude  strictly coronavirus-related, seems first mass gathering near end pandemic. think pretty irresponsible since lot people fully vaccinated then... would much preferred October kidding. mention several big states spiking bad Ontario right now. Neither countries woods yet. first Moderna shot almost month ago second dose Monday.

 took ibuprofen first dose u could experience symptom( hypochondriac) like preemptively hope mess effectiveness 1st shot.
Now know Monday get home shot. hope statistic caught covid19 variant despite fully vaxed  Avoid politics. mean people still feeling effects Covid getting better vaccinated? Alberta going hit 2k cases day probably next week government anything minimal restrictions. comfortable 1k hositpals. yeah annoying doesnt really wear parents anti mask. im literally one wearing disinfecting. like mom vaccinated thinks shes fine. basically confined room point even tho feel like could run 5k. oh well rather safe sorry That's 6,500 USA, 736 Canada, 1300 UK adjusted population. One husband's former employers provided sick childcare benefit awesome. can't remember many days year got, someone would come home care mildly ill child could go work. also onsite alternate childcare could use regular childcare unavailable. stay home mom time, sick town, kids could go work Dad, great.

Purchasing earlier mean write contract gives priority later contracts, done cases. also means companies able start preparing manufacturing *earlier* - EU signed contract, would want start spending money increasing capacity?

In response earlier comment. put around 90% EU UK import ca 5 million doses India (eventually) 40 million doses Biontech. 

To stay language, WTF bring purchase dates relevant? something wrong that? comment feel so... entitled?

Not mention gave “loan” bypasses Trump-era vaccine export ban. guarantee “loan” forgiven paid back.  EU already exported enough protect vulnerable across globe (and Israel), really put foot put citizens first stage.

No. Exporting protect vulnerable across globe *good* thing - ethical pov also fight global pandemic. I'm glad EU it. communicated louder beginning get good PR deserve it, fact EU sucks PR nothing new unfortunately. France, it’s announced second dose AZ replaced Pfizer Moderna. Germany 5% . We‘re far quality made Germany days. really understand people enough? vaccines now. that’s enough get us this, is?

At point learn accept manage residual risk. wait zero risk lifting restrictions never get lives back. people want things open (a group includes me) would rather live life slightly elevated risk harm exist indefinitely “safe” prisoners. nothing selfish unscientific that—it’s human. Yeah asking doubt lower percentage people Chile live poverty US standards.

 Yeah this, like aint us considers poor isnt like.. extremely poor places. Like u cant even get min wage job become poorer shit like that. Irrelevant UK EU's rollout. No-one expecting vaccines pretty much get-go invoked war time powers. reason UK set AZ supply chains domestically knew rely USA. expect little co-operation EU though (because AZ shortfalls unforeseen event) sure downvoted. Yup, vaccinated throw rest trash like get full buffet Source “99%” “0.2%” stats ? 

Majority people know still working home. Similar experience here; got site, everything super efficient. Scheduling appointment took approximately 200 times longer actual vaccination process. Well given comments Von der Leyen untrue. demanding reciprocity UK exports. demanding AZ fulfill contracts direct demand UK. 

Also EUs demands AZ really reasonable AZ meeting contracts, aren’t UK still missing around 50% first delivery due 2020. shows would better centralised system gives appointments ASAP radius prepared travel.

Well yes, actually hard compare countries. comparison within Europe still far meaningful comparison fucking New Zealand. aerosol transmission. Even smaller. Floats longer. point making incredibly misinform know that.

How much UK produce month? 2m/week AZ, restricted use 

How much UK use? more, Pfizer Biontech

Where rest come? place Exports

The EU wanted exports UK factories AZ promised. Australia asked UK allowed it. argument made see makes either UK AZ look good. 
We wanted vaccines bought UK plants like delivering vaccines EU plants UK bought, regardless manufaturer. ""European Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton - heads EU executive’s vaccine task force"" nuff said. Yes 33% least one. EU keep demanding UK exports them? 

The EU demand it, fact. EU demands companies fulfill contracts, case AZ includes exporting doses UK cannot manage produce enough doses within EU. Well, we've received half that. HOA (home owner's association) bar/restaurant family medical center. 

A lot rich people lived there. shipped whole bunch astrazencia (doesn’t look good now) PNG support neighbouring country due safe situation

In America shipped AZ Canada Mexico safe position. I'm sure point analogy pretty bad. article answer, hard. remember Vc = 1 - 1/R0, Vc fraction needs immunity R0 average number persons newly infected patient spreads disease to.

For Vc = .67 would need R0 = 3. 
For Vc = .9 must case R0 = 10. 
In words, current variant infects average 7 people previous variant. Recently learned John McCain's mom actually attended funeral! 81 mom 106. crazy me. Yeah, bought Pfizer early - much earlier EU - assessed/approved much earlier too. paid fair whack it, spent factories happened located within EU (albeit UK supply chain involvement). Biontech/Pfizer Germany got new plant working (mir April) 1 Billion doses per year. antivax country can't see happening... lost half million people year. afford put mask first put mask neighbors. Btw, neighbors struggling produce vaccines. countries suggesting put *before* ours? US it. one seems blaming them. Quite contrary, getting praised vaccination rollout.  agree UK best citizens, judge that.

However, consider amount disgusting vitriol British press thrown EU past weeks something entirely EU's fault, can't help feeling little bit sour.

Additionally, actions taken least somewhat suspicious. Namely, could UK government possibly aware doses secretly exported Australia? repeatedly claim cannot export AZ doses EU contract gives priority, despite EU recording thousands deaths every day, ""somehow"" doses end exported Australia basically covid free? even claim know anything them, despite contract cited boldly stating every dose produced AZ exported approval?

Again, judge UK prioritizing citizens, fair. can't always call peace understanding. Words actions consequences. happening countries months now. huge trucks china used spray roads? I’ll one day party next? Honestly get kick US failing something. Trump great time me. time tell - good I'm slightly annoyed it. year worldwide pandemic, still incredible amount people see use public restroom take piss, wash hands afterwards. Us Americans disguisting people. rest world starts open up, borders stay closed. That's going massive impact economy recovery pandemic. know feel we’re still lockdown lmao nobody could block anything. argument always partly true.

We could easily block/buy dosses like US UK IN. lack could barter doses have. googled confirm, right. 85% *far* miracle. norm. course, OP happy calling miracle plain wrong. Thanks answer. US 33% least one shot correct? Isreal? nothing Brexit then? 

Also it’s incorrect question EU pushing hard exports country ‘depends practically exports’ nations. Maybe reply point rather bringing Brexit (?) going contracts EU AZ, don’t involve UK all. country practically allied China throughout whole pandemic lol probably mostly written bot. know bit sausage made Reuters great dedicated reporters, company is... eh. France compared England? Gemany pathetic XYZ. Germany able Germany spend way much time thinking instead try things adapt quick required changes. Kind null consider Marburg completely independent within EU. using every single one doses quarter nets EU 250m doses far planned 300m Q2. plants produced around 150m doses Q1, even assuming lipid blocks thrown back EU halving previous production leaves EU net 325m doses. assumes speedup production previous plants too. could far could left EU enough doses guarantee people vaccine end June.

The EU already exported enough protect vulnerable across globe (and Israel), really put foot put citizens first stage. big hit norwegian morale, that's sure That's sad statement US citizens care rest world months well be. every country would acted way situation Thats simply true. advisory boards take account group COVID equal lesser risk taking AZ vaccine. did, Germany AstraZeneca widely used anymore, usually people 65 without existing risk blood clots brain. grandma told concerned getting AstraZeneca, got Biontech. Wait, wtf? police chief boasted wouldn’t fined anyone PM breaking rules also breaks?

If broke rule fine penalty, fine, fine her. fine others breaking law, too, don’t law. equal treatment law, selective enforcement think she’s hypocritical people also make enforce rules. police chief admitted hypocrite didn’t fine himself? Hypocrisy isn’t offense would pretty impractical prosecute uniformly he’s going to, needs throw ass jail According [this come senior source close vaccine-production process told newspaper Pfizer “heavily dependent” supplies lipid ingredients factories EU receiving “fatty molecules” chemicals firm based [Pfizer/BioNTech] told commission UK shuts lipids whole process grinds halt weeks,” source added.

I've seen people Reddit saying one factory use lipids UK, source that. I'd absolutely fine too. However, point vaccine variants keep going spread risking health services overwhelmed over? I'm fully vaccinated make unvaccinated person even they've never COVID, care point. Oh nah hoping best case. need thing over. Here's fun part moving forward:

In order complete vaccination goals time, UK increased reliance Pfizer Moderna, given news regarding AZ recommendation 30s. (Potentially also Novavax J&amp;J, operational UK time). order reach goals, UK need export doses vaccines EU.

Now, none companies missed targets delivering doses EU. But, given powers EU granted vaccine export authorisation, ability block anyway, choose to. 

Given high emotions within Commission certain member states this, can't entirely put past block these, even though would quite reckless move long term, given would preventing private companies fulfilling contracts short term political gains. normal year, think twice EU acting manner supports internationalist liberal rules based order. normal year... Germany, use periods commas bit differently number formatting.

600.000 = 600,000 discipline? hygiene? pretend Japan Magical Land Hygiene. People nasty anywhere, government give shit. Living absolute nightmare. Philippines aren’t done vaccinating healthcare workers lmao  Woo glad got “elective” cancer preventing op done already Got first dose Tuesday many 25% full anti-vaxers never get many waiting vaccine trials completed feeling better getting it?  Right that's meant, named virus. Even name sounds scarier. comments always crack Darwin handle things.

So people get vaccine die result natural selection? Lol. 

Also insinuation non-vaccinated responsible prolonging pandemic every fear mongering news outlet pushing ""vaccines protect variants!"" line. 

Get story straight. Another reason Denmark (no knowledge NL) buy extra doses BionTech countries didnt buy full allotment. gives bit top.
A big factor also many doses per vial - given quite extra. Looks like comment got deleted, possibly swearing. goes: 


 

To give long analogy, like watching someone driving toward cliff edge; they're slowing down, deviating course, ignoring everyone sidelines begging LEAST slow turn away, driver's yelling bystanders, ""It's RIGHT, FREEDOM drive fast, direction!!"".

(bystanders) ""We're trying help save life die kill others!"" 
(hypothetical driver) ""F\*\*k you, can't tell do!""

Essentially. That's felt like, like watching someone *purposefully* hurt despite sorts warnings, horror able help reduce harm deaths. know, 'muh freedoms'.

Now, seems many Canadians trying damnedest go route. :( Yeah well least economy collapse. Sweden nailed approach. 56 y/o dad got J&amp;J side effect sore arm. sharing I've heard bad things side effects thought I'd throw proven possible survive without brain. cases immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, occurred first shot. good. US make purchase orders bullied way front line. gave additional money build production capacity fund vaccine development vaccines approved. That's exactly it. I'm scared injections. last 2 times tried donate blood last time got vaccine, passed within minute getting shot. tempted get J&amp;J one reason single shot.  


However, available scheduled mine got Pfizer. lie, second shot knocked day pretty bad, pass shot. really feel first one much, second one felt alcohol prep pad. still wincing waiting shot done. definitely ""excuse"" countries different strategies based demographics country.

This uniform approach strategy. Thus differences exist.  Ugh.  


The stupid.  


It HURTS. really want get 70 80% need tk stop gonna force XYZ give XYZ. approach literally pushing people get vaccinated side. 

We start basics:
1. PR campaign explaining vaccine works getting lead normal. fake normal tk show papers real normal. Set goal 80% people vaccinated normal. 2. PR campaign explain kids 5 risk. covid mask lockdowns. Let people know getting vaccinated help them. People tend willing sacrifice children, largely ignored last year.
3. Don’t talk variants gonna never normal. Biden CDC ask “experts” focus science stop fear spreading. know vaccine chance normal maybe telling people won’t stop spread know bad idea. lost millions people comments. 
4. Don’t political. constantly batter Republicans call names making want vaccine. It’s fact highest group turning vaccine African Americans. It’s political it’s trust making political undermining trust.

If want people vaccinated CDC needs gain trust. don’t good PR constant positive message. 

When someone tells anti-vaccine follow steps: stop yell. Ask feel way. empathic them. Explain it’s important vaccinate others. Let know support matter give space. 

We need tk supportive. able get two people anti-vaccine (not covid vaccine like real anti-vaccine) get covid vaccinated said above. kind understand concerns works people scared even scared kids grandkids getting vaccinated line try prevent needing it. virus called Sars-2 disease causes called Covid-19. see point. second forgot talking Brazil. J&amp;J shot yesterday last night awful. 8 hours shot like hit truck. could see concern people given alternatives makes sense. Yeah, agree numbers used little mixed tried stay within Q2. get guys revolt essentially prisoners island. apologize, you’re right. reading article immediately mentions it. mean, don’t know would say I’m terrified. I’m mother, I’ll always want keep healthy give good life. 

My youngest turn 2- everything remembers covid. also condition 1 10,000. don’t illusions covid could really hurt her. Even death, possible permanent damage organs development. There’s also children use several activities year numerous play dates suddenly stopped last year. would nice able regain degree normal without thought bringing severe case baby sister. Normal slightly delayed kids, we’re looking another *year*. youngest 3. I’m trying best kids various needs, end 9.5 hours didn’t happen. Pfizer mRNA vaccine (AZ isn't) work way. I've seen risk clots. surprised feel like got flu day two We're Canada hope pays soon. We're getting hammered variants right now. kind annoys failed mention KY 50% adults one dose administering 90% vaccine we’ve given. comment makes sound like Kentuckians aren’t part one leading states country comes vaccinations (and Covid cases matter). We’ve seen little bit slow Governor said yesterday, attributed Spring Break opened 16+ 4/5. 

Anyway, I’m sure meant well comment implies KY isn’t well vaccinations. honest... really care. that's kind told him. effective preventing hospitalizations vaccine. 60% number whatever measured different metric Pfizer Moderna using theirs. course insists true honestly way everything. reality thinks everyone else different wrong.  need work let suck in. course, incidents need investigated. think it’s also interesting consider J&amp;J vaccine one shot marketed people extreme anxiety/other reactions injections.  may overrepresented population receives vaccine. vaccinating 50K per day

Because EU countries receive vaccines relative population. 

This fairly obvious. add Vicks vapor rub inside. Late, yes. enough, no. People leaving ""COVID plague!!"" Camp droves simply true. really matter believe proof pudding. really think people going accept world kids grab lunchbox mask sit socially distant school day every child vaccinated, high. 

And burden covid part? recognize ironic think burden disease mild cases 1/3 US population already vaccinated millions kids losing access quality education? evidence vaccines whole continually proven safe long term. might accept due new mRNA vaccine, weird people to.  Also check county health department dose saver lists get on. got mine Wednesday that. called minutes 5pm asked free come immediately. Told needed 5 minutes yes. 5:36 arm. (Time stamp selfie.) SARS big Toronto showed up. Luckily SARS transmission level COVID-19 largely contained limited hospitals. Still crazy time. need offer every adult vaccine offer child life-threatening comorbidities vaccine, adults say no, choice deal risk, people low.

This comes someone fully vaccinated. Yes, common. Exactly. hate seeing complaints sulking way whole vaccine situation handled EU specifically Germany US UK, glad banning exports grabbing vaccine everyone else get hands it. Yes, complicated world fair neither distribution vaccine be, hate think vulnerable poor countries left mercy virus rich countries reaching herd immunity. Old people dying greater rates specific distinguishable COVID surprise anyone. possible may annoying. Man called disease SARS-2 Still, France worse numbers I’ve basically seen Germans complain. Maybe Germans active reddit, idk Something something Clark County Represent. 

Wright State also ton open appointments. Got mine yesterday (JnJ though since I'm taking classes) many child raping Republicans like this? Everybody knows virus named year. Ted Nugent, famous raping 12 year old Courtney Love, intentionally trying diminish deaths 570,000 Americans almost 3,000,000 people world wide. opinion child rapist, Ted Nugent, carries weight ignored. I'm American using european vaccines. Pfizer seeking full approval next month others follow shortly after. It’s matter time. Great point. 
I also see health provides lobbying vaccine.
Covid testing, increased hospital stays admittance increased profits health providers. Sick people bting money unfortunately. 
But definitely see point requiring vaccine decrease insurance costs. second drama probably USA starts stockpile vaccines vaccinated domestically - worry idications USA insist keeping export ban untill deliveries made - even got stock.

I wouldn’t worry this. There’s absolute glut vaccines. Existing deals Moderna/J&amp;J/Pfizer line enough supply every adult mid-June. least 1 5 won’t get shot, unclaimed Pfizer/Moderna doses cover kids, already approved kids. won’t need order these. 

In event variant would get Moderna print new rna meant counter new spike. would effective variant easier sell public stockpiled AZ doses today.

So least 500m AZ doses absolutely worthless US anything diplomatic bargaining chips. We’ll sell donate somewhere summer. Novavax also get approved next month deliver 100m doses, I’m sure happen those. AZ lion’s share, gonna go. That, people get vaccinated, holdouts realize vaccines aren’t causing 5G whatever likely come around they’re one friend groups vaccinated. They're jealous ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ It’s amazing think Javits Center used time last year. week recieved enough average 100k/day weve hit 2 days row hope continues never happened US either. thread year ago highlights

* Complaints we've reached testing cap around 30k confirmed cases per day
* People correctly estimating NY peaked deaths pandemic

* Found comment made social distancing measures lifted necessarily mean businesses reopen...not sure heck even meant going super interesting seeing thoughts year ago go old threads

* arguments masks work drive could probably gotten away pajamas, put jeans first time months... made uncomfortably aware put covid 19 (lbs). Dutch government opportunity invest €1 million AstraZeneca vaccin order get vaccins earlier. didn’t, eventhough factory Delft.

Seems like lot governments made wrong judgements... Imagine dense. Receiving 20 million doses EU. exporting single one. Calling EU douches wont shit. awful job, big brother Science came saved ass. 

If anything, even dumber next time happens terrible everything throughout. Doubtful. Available doses floor right now. We've got ahead doubt we'll 'defeat' virus untill EU also near immunity. know country in, CDC says fine People don’t want hear “great” America is, greatness comes strength varied institutions. It’s leg competition. hey I'm wondering there's anything blood clotting major side effects pfizer vaccine. whenever google says astrazeneca one causing blood clotting stuff. anyone know? also I'm getting 2nd dose today kinda nervous lol think enployer mandated vaccination ever happen. work bank invasive corporation get (monitors personal finances, real-time GPS tracking company issued phones, etc) came said going require vaccination return office. hot button issue lot potential create legal/PR challenges, think view risk/reward tradeoff worth it. I'm disputing that. I'm saying wager house bet.  Mald sure remember wear pants. many us dressing Zoom calls only. unpleasant piece cloth magic thing prevents whole generation lung, brain, nerve disorders

Listen got vaccine encourage everyone else think weird people would believe safe *long term* despite evidence.

Antibodies recovered people got mRNA vaccine [work variants *and* OG really put variant fear behind us.

B.1.351 [isn't scary thought robust Seem Reduce Spread**

Vaccination previous infection[ reduce viral load, reduces article good job explaining likelihood vaccines *at least* reducing spread. [This may help too. Data [Scotland looks

[Maybe even one [get doses rare, studies show [less 1 (maybe 1 10,000 range, read study, awesome). Reinfections tend much milder previous infections, even new variants. Check [comments really interesting discussion regarding reinfection. Especially top comment thread. **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" 100% correct, (though may changing soon!). now, ""probably not, looks like vaccinated people transmit virus, can't ever transmit it"". best [""it's really *really* Getting less likely day.

Can vaccinated people get infected? Yes, sometimes, lot less likely unvaccinated people. 

Is big deal do? No. Cases people vaccinated much milder.

Even variants? point, breakthrough infection one variant vaccinated people.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, [that would end worse experts hedge least me, way experts framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

That said, seem [saying I've

Even shittiest masks seem work, [but Positivity Rate: said lot subs positivity rate go time people vaccinated require testing. Last year, *the* metric watch, likely wane quickly importance overall testing drops. necessarily worry sudden high positivity rates, mass testing likely drop pretty quickly, particularly testing sites converted vaccination sites. 

We may want use newly found testing sequencing capacity test sequence higher proportion flu samples. might give us head start flu genetics circulating, help eliminate flu two. We're single digits flu cases places, awesome! likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.


Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

NYT [some good fact, [they *

More [good news goodness. like read comments something... side effects vaccine:

Nobody saying side effects. clearly side effects. I'm even saying side effects vaccine could last years. effects infection may show while, [and know last long notably loss sense smell.

I'm saying we'd find side effects within months. side effects suddenly show six months vaccination already shown people.

If example side effect vaccine side effects seen within first four months suddenly found four months post-vaccination, I'd change wording post.

I'll tell though, I've still gotten example vaccine side effect show least people way vaccine administered.

I get plenty ""look, vaccine used decades ago tiny country rarely causes one long-term side effect, wrong"", address point I'm making. Israel, tracked ""recovered"" people put bottom list vaccine considered immune. words, people recovered vaccinated considered immune.

One thing check though lot people say covid never actually got tested, like symptoms assumed. unless actually got tested necessarily believe them. wouldnt sure Argentina. April 2019 8/9k cases testing 20/25k samples day. testing +90k day 'records' 20/22/23k cases (yesterday 23.7k cases). testing = cases. goverment known corrupt manipulating data. Yes, timeline surprise.

What saw bothered people couldn’t stand anything trump said go without attacked. (specifically table labeled ""Age-Specific Mortality Rates (per Million) COVID-19 (March-October 2020) Leading Causes Death (March-October Sweden (which went ""full fox news"" many cases even require masking), ICU admission rate fewer 1 100,000 last year treatments &amp; prevention less well understood. Lol. stop Americans tracks bragging they've got J&amp;J need AZ.  Thanks, thought may simple. two weeks away second Moderna shot though, done I'm two weeks past talk doctor. They’ve always great “handling masses” Ibuprofen anything hamper effectiveness vaccine. Whether feel full brunt side effects not, working. Take ibu feel bad (or even prophylactically). I'm sure understand post. 

But low white blood cell count means us easier get infected. also means easier generate resistant variants. Still wrong. point it’s music &amp; it’s going lots fun. people don’t find mask obstructive unable good time. 

If masks big bother you, think hard time certain circumstances moving forward. It’s unlikely masks forever thing everyone, thing required access certain situations quite longer sure.

Have tried one disposable medical masks yet? light, especially compared cloth mask, would likely much obstruction you.  Efficiency maybe, definitely bureaucracy. that's problem. Doctors complaining can't enough vaccinations much bureaucracy going it. goes Corona App I've encouraged swallow entire bags cucumber shaped objects. makes run HR get yelled bully. company insists using measurable statistics make HR decisions. They'll fire heartbeat make X widgets like supposed make X widgets toxic everyone around you, that's fine there's way measure someone's level assholery see acceptable not. frustrating. guy vacation things million times better. require subreddit come conclusion. know indian would know almost impossible that. better export it. might people countries still human beings like us. need much point causing potential wastage. necessarily support idea ""vaccine passports"" something keep mind immunizations vaccines required domestically long time schools certain jobs. really new.

I think period time minority people vaccinated majority going pretty short, like less 6 months. Trying create national database vaccinations forgery-proof vaccination cards period really make sense me. likely business owners get staff vaccinated open up, people refuse get vaccinated show anyway risk.

Simpul waiting long time guys wrapped round little finger lol.

If charge! Wow, one dose efficacy is...disappointing. Hopefully countries using ""first doses first"" strategy relying Sinovac. pedantic. absolutely know saying. Thanks contribution  would like true, see first one realistic. 

There penalty lying / falsifying vaccination record entering theme park. 

Lying health insurance application least state though huge offense, one printed bold red letters forms. 

I support (almost) measures ensure vaccination hope year end isn’t even topic needing discussion.  metric determined value efficient? say countries 'efficient' fail provide metric comparison EU countries corroborate argument. tribalism today ridiculous. Apparently vaccine shaming thing even amongst vaxxed. Moderna people supposed throw shade Pfizer people vice versa. got J&amp;J red headed step child supposed bash thing now. ridiculous. way tribalism colored response pandemic awful really. Even whole vaccine passport thing gets different reactions depending party politician belongs opposing them. really bad really need figure fix I'm sure won't. I’m 22, chances getting low thing I’d testing waters year would working, mask.

I wouldn’t want test waters social gatherings going maskless till least Next March. 4 nothing clots aren’t clots. know pattern it. it’s far early say anything. Texas Florida - counting deaths caused Covid pneumonia, heart attack, stroke deaths? Comments post positive miss point: bad news massively delays rollout don’t enough Pfizer doses yet. We’re going trapped borders shut lot longer thought. Absolutely American going get AZ vaccine blood clot fiasco 3+ vaccines choose covid need get vaccine. pushing vaccine people matter circumstances, really disconcerting know I'd want take gamble. hours terribleness vs knows effects current long lasting. pathetic, wishing ill others got good there. hell man. lost grandparents due disease problem lot places link enough vaccines masks made.

My state announced reopening metrics ago, *no* metric dropping mask requirement (just whenever CDC longer recommends them, means absolutely nothing). office definitely going go state rules, one extra push get vaccinated. probably fine. advice seen anything extreme right around vaccination. experiment drugs, get wasted, run marathon etc. 

You want immune system operating high level incorporate changes vaccine inducing. Realistically, expecting get vaccine sometime late April May. We’re pace vaccinate 70% adults (at least one dose) early June. Considering 20% 30% population vaccine-hesitant, means adults want shot proactive get one June.

How safe it? parents fully vaxxed, they’re safe they’ll ever be. Sure, there’s always slight risk they’ll contract it, even then, vaccine reduces risk serious illness. It’s fact can’t anything wrong, it’s fact even things right, get shit Thanks Joe Biden! wrong death count United States thr worst.

 Next Brazil, Mexico, India, UK, Italy.

We feel like less loser go death per million though. absolute amount citizens dead USA absolute worst planet may well happening, you’re group ran 101+ fever you’re prob bullshitting. 

Mine topped 101.9 I’ve ran fever adult handful times. miserable 36 hours. 

That said, way better getting Covid. We're gonna need new wall. UK produced millions vaccines Getting orange fuck White House certainly helped Ireland four times small we're currently 20,000 day increasing 30,000 soon.

4 times smaller landmass 13 times smaller population difference bad make sound.  would get tested. symptoms COVID. China vaccine (Sinopharm) almost 0 risk side effects. effectiveness, stop infection. give thoughts benefits week now.  I've read great many them, including mentions articles topics. comment they're posted, asking articles women are? us ordered vaccines used us citizens first, long order outstanding us get filled first long produced us. amount money change that.

AZ gets exported us using israel japan got exceptions certain amount vaccines.

Israel receives it‘s orders partly us pfizers Biontechs european plants. beginning, family doctors get doses hopefully, 1 million daily possible. Think this: item news Norway fines violating restrictions, applied fine person position authority.

In so, Norway done basically considered unthinkable countries. words, one countries political leaders actually accountable. 
This confirmation big dumpster fire US regards covid19

I mean like basketball game one team gets destroyed first 45mins 50 points 3 mins go close gap lose 45pts end. losing team outscored winner 5 pts last 3 mins . 

USA 3 mins lol getting vaccine, getting second shot 3 days... see die covid asking taking ibuprofen onset symptoms appear. Apologies answered already, getting second Pfizer dose last night I'm curious: time frame achieve maximum level efficacy dose? heard two weeks first dose one week second dose. correct? locked immediately knew serious variant way genetic testing US, variant 3-4 months ago them. already past strict lock increasing vaccinations. US middle it. different time lines spread response takes time variants travel seed new populations. AKA way meekly following orders till maybe allow freedom. family mostly identifies Republican well. single person hesitated get vaccine. Actually 3 people knew hesitancy liberal 3 eventually got it.

As OP stated significant chunk people planning getting vaccine anti-vaxxers. know several young simply think necessary. come around well. They’ll get airplanes start requiring even domestic travel. better yet, Walmart requires entry. We're really ""flirting flu numbers"". 0.1% CFR often cited seasonal flu amounts ""flu respiratory viruses identify specific one caused it"". true CFR seasonal flu way less 0.1%. No, I’m pointing multiple vastly different technologies US can't win, it. 

When vaccines first people said ""omg numbers low""

Now they're crushing numbers, people say ""omg they're hogging vaccines""

Pull finger mess, similar US every state different rules concepts. assume 20 percent recovery rate evenly distributed you’re looking near 70 percent immunity. investments Denmark make companies? many employees bank roll test results unknown? Denmark pre-paid vaccines billed fact like business done?

There difference customer orders loaf bread baker customer believed enough baker give oven line door.  Seems like lot governments made wrong judgements...

Because incomplete information. Nobody knew vaccines would work ones wouldn't. companies would able scale production quickly. could take best shot choosing, knowing might wrong. think right decision time Romania. 

You worry could harm reputation vaccines given side effect, amount people going die much larger delaying vaccines. We’re using Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J, HQed US. AstraZeneca yet approved.

Enjoy blood clots, btw. Wrong African Americans. Conservatives car likely distrust vaccines. say social “surface area” highest amongst young people overwhelmingly liberal, demographic gets heavily vaccinated feel could cancel undervaccination older demographics. 

Anecdotally, conservative friends (in 20’s) eager vaccinated. college educated people might representative young conservatives. Canadian, yes sucks, can’t really blame country taking care first. annoying though half America didn’t take seriously first place get vaccines. Agree. businesses require shirts shoes, vaccines? least state hours, often midnight, log answers questions midnight initially clicking state availability get scheduler start pressing search button midnight.

That said, 100%, drop doses throughout day recently there's drops 4-6am instead midnight. Basically, midnight common guaranteed. also received jabs state run site NY. efficient!!! Thank FEMA national guard!!! EU countries receive amounts

Not quite, differences last year vaccine order amounts mechanism nations could buy/reserve different percentages vaccines. Germany went heavy BionTech, countries like Austria Bulgaria example went AZ partially probably lot cheaper looked promising time. betting AZ bit disadvantage now. EU recently decided change distribution model ahead schedule delivery 10m doses BioNTech vaccine help 5 countries hit hardest AZ shortfalls still exactly equal depending decisions made ago. got second dose yesterday enjoyed beer last night 🍻  long shot ""safe zone"" far know? probably harsh decision makers stuff. year ago mRNA vaccines unknown quantity. None ever made approval process before, despite attempts. can't blame people cautious. US gambled won, could easily gone way. vaccines worked, US would spot everyone else right now. got flamed death earlier pandemic daring suggest there's difference island 22 miles coast world COVID centre, one major travel logistical hubs vs 3,000 miles nearest land. beggars belief. said that? bring Iraq war? say “20+ years” that’s experience with, many years sentiment same: “The US business Vietnam”, “The US shouldn’t Korea”. sentiment resounded decades, statement still stands. 

You said people telling US mind business 20+ years. bring invasions US carried prior that. point stand, talking foreign interventions.

You're one linking together idea people Canada hypocritical like American wars, want vaccines produced America. crazy statement. free support development vaccine manufacturing facilities pay costs maintaining presence within borders part national defense. lack facilities US’s doing, government’s careful calculus wouldn’t necessary. Perhaps lobby additional manufacturing facilities Canada? 

Why would lobby foreign government build pharmaceutical factories?

Now whole problem Canada individually build build vaccine factories, Canada rich country, I'm sure afford it.

The problem efficient production chain pharmaceutical companies, means global production chain. Instead, propose world shifts building dozens inefficient national production chains, protect future vaccine nationalism.

So look global perspective, scenario, entire human race gets less vaccines, rather more, instead building efficient production chain, we're supposed practice pharmaceutical wonder would Canada’s response country contained manufacturing facilities? Send everyone else around world first? likely not. probably would US, always try take care closely identify with, carryover communal tribalism likely, see others assisted “before we’ve helped own” something resonates people every nation. 

Maybe buried human instincts, make right thing do.

And Canada might alternative universe, can't pretend know that. might same, better worse. Nobody claim know won’t say “fuck em”, want get everyone quickly possible, government responsibility citizens first. 

And viewpoint. agree it, least consistent honest. point mainly people trying pretend like policy US. curiosity, okay consume alcohol before/after Pfizer vaccination? anyone done impact? can... im super confused question.

I’m gonna people Florida Texas doing, I’m stringent masks everything. want test waters working. wouldn’t laugh *too hard*. guys higher death per capita rate, tanked economy, still severe lockdown. Germany too, however, talked GP „your risk“. pretty much sums Germany, yeah. I'm Brazil and... know :( single dose would massive, especially since seems like it’ll annualized. want follow CDC guidance, recommended take antihistamine prior recommended take over-the-counter medicine – ibuprofen, aspirin, acetaminophen – vaccination purpose trying prevent vaccine-related side effects. known medications might affect well vaccine works. However, take medications regularly reasons, keep taking get vaccinated. also recommended take antihistamines getting COVID-19 vaccine try prevent allergic reactions. realize lit vaccines came Europe. imported beginning even alliw export material requiredto produce them. bit respectful since vaccine originally developed fucking Europeans  hate agree this. pandemic response poor, allegedly roll would shit too, biden administration would roll praised without vaccines secured. regards hypotheticals, find hard believe administration done thing throwing money problem Well we're already 75% 65+ age group. older folks tend conservative, conservatives ones saying get vaccinated. 

So based faultless scientific logic train, I'd say we'll definitely get least 75% population vaccinated point. Recently tested positive covid really opened eyes important masks social distancing are. virus extremely contagious think lot people don’t understand that. vaccines cause that, alternative J&amp;J change it.  Moderna bed ridden shot 2 18 hours. Germans complaining go together, let's over-complicate this. Seems like closing borders travel vaccinating everyone works. Look Israel. Everyone following lead. Still dumpster fire. mean they've Vaccinating much still way way higher daily per capita infections deaths wife want visit Australia bad. We’re sad can’t now. us vaccinated yesterday (J&amp;J) hopes allow us vaccine cards UK seeing increasing problems amongst children despite schools back open? Getting one dose Wednesday. bullying needed. cash money upfront. No, isn’t really possible. cant google yourselves.

Brasil P-1 upside everyone vaccinated small problem areas still protected.

Would much rather see pockets infection, contained without chance spreading larger community, rather persistent baseline spread throughout Country. Yup J&amp;J looks like 'problems' AZ tbh. 4 deaths (or cases, I've forgot) blood clots plagued AZ reported far. put much hope younger population. Colleges also using socal distancing way crackdown partying off-campus activities post covid. make sense? Lol. would virus called “Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome 2”? naming conventions coronaviruses beyond stupid. Biden already stated goal vaccination station within 5 miles 90% Americans month.

We need get fellow citizens board. tragedy newest wave unfolding around world (and starting to, here) wake call. let Brits hear you, wastorn apart criticizing AZs action. Idk connect national pride shitty companies understand takes weeks full effect right? kids vaccine approved, set period kids get like vaccinations submit. know ""but freedoms"" people tizzy that's keep teachers can't get allergies whatever kids safe. doesn’t really matter, right? 

As vaccination kills spread variants, leave room SA variant spread vaccinated previously infected people. blocking vaccine export (even approved/used yet). I'm set get J&amp;J two hours so. know supposed take ibuprofen/tylenol beforehand, ok take allergy medication before? (Azelastine). took dog allergies real today. Definition “vaccine hestitancy”  

In 2019, declared “vaccine hesitancy” one top 10 global health Ask explain full detail FDA approval process you, every bit nuance spare. Since they're obviously experts topic. Looks like France latest ban second doses AZ: long rest world follow suit? Certainly reduces case anyone 1 dose AZ banned group another country accept second dose, likely wait message changes allow second doses safer vaccine considering children calculation. 3 4 adults enough. Horses tend keep feet clean steaming terd piles never claimed anything good US response. pointing plenty Canadians gleefully pissing smoldering corpse America last year. wonder exporting single vaccine. Meanwhile see China exported 150 million doses, hey US good guys ones save world, right? actual figure maybe higher. reports state governments fudging data mean buy first PC first time 8 years... 🤔🤔🤔 hope. I'm sure mass hysteria work right way, make uninformed feel ""left out"" enough get vaccinated. Usually double down. We're headed dystopian split unvaccinated might mean second class citizen unable travel, attend etc. Tho probably get fake cards place got ""Mask Exempt"" ones.

Things getting better E484K way important comes vaccine efficiency. Also missing parts country already way better Canada. states buoying numbers, far away states we'll pandemic biggest opposition schools opening teachers unions wield considerable political power. Germans like complain... (I Live there...) =) Yes, Mississippi's whole population either white conservatives african americans. exactly enthusiastic vaccine. must mask mandate! tried lockdowns? probably safe say country except maybe Brazil ever reach First I’m antivaccer. Second all, look time takes approve vaccine general public would understand peoples concern, 1 4 big number public skeptical. antivaccers term mean. vaccine rushed proper protocol, that’s fact. Maybe touch facts educate yourself. There’s vaccine site shut NC adverse effects 20 people fainting. Btw FDA agency inside department health human services, part government dummy. Dunno you‘re downvoted. would someone willingly choose objectively worse vaccine provided better option? fully vaccinated mid May, meaning 2 weeks second dose, good travel actually take vacation? wife pondering going Vegas May 19-26, fully vaccinated, second dose Apr 12 her's 21st. know still wear masks mind respect others, news makes feel like still afraid virus, catching it, even vaccinated. kind feel like irresponsible go May. mean, since getting vaccinated cant try get back 'normal' life? Y'all dumb go One thirst quinch?! told hydrate literally drank almost gallon half water first pfizer shot. That’s I’m talking about. France ~700 cases per 100.000, Belgium NL ~550 cases per 100.000 Germany ~248 cases per 100.000. 

However mostly see Germans complaining high numbers, wondering is. political considerations. hard impose restrictions based solely computer models.

In perfect world would possible politicians don’t live perfect world. people put gigantic payments purchase vaccines long ago.

Don't act like manufacturers anything abiding contracts. Maybe try stamping feet release partially redacted confidential contracts media? Trouble much imports driven truckers Europe, stopping every 6 hours worst places COVID.

 mention millions transiting travellers come Heathrow Gatwick way somewhere else. problems AUS NZ face! legitimately name ;) difficult country owns vaccines friend. Much smaller population weekly rallies anti mask/vaccine rallies small city. say 50 people max get much attention. Yeah ponied ton money purchase vaccines, paid them.

You'll never convince country hit hardest take care citizens helping old world Europe. friend said coworker got Covid saw week ago. save meet friend week now? would 2 weeks since saw coworker? hunch folks hesitant take vaccine also hesitant follow safety guidelines pandemic. hate say ""I hope lot got COVID"", reality going get shot, ""contribution"" herd immunity previous infection, even that's solid long term vaccine would be.

The damage lives done wanted turn apolitical thing planet (a virus) political ""debate"", one shameful chapters history. South Korea, broke million people vaccinated! month half.... 4.1 years, got this! Ffffff.... “When comes rates vaccination, Mississippi still way go, quarter residents received least one dose compared nationwide average 33 percent, according state data. southern states, among Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama Georgia, similarly low rates vaccination.

A closer look Mississippi’s demographics explains hesitancy may especially pronounced.The state reliably votes Republican, group remains highly skeptical coronavirus vaccine. Nearly half Republican men 40 percent Republicans said plan get vaccinated, according several recent surveys. figures barely budged months since vaccines first became available. contrast, 4 percent Democrats said get vaccine.” hey :)... hate america ... i'm getting downvoted hell sharing opinion :)... 

&amp;#x200B;

but know, everyone idiots .. people comply anyways weird one. vaccinated people age range thought country. Illegal immigrants, foreigners etc. uptake high. Boston Globe: New Hampshire lift vaccine residency requirement saying hold get raises time off!? Doubt happen. day greg abbott revoked mask mandate manager greeted without mask announcing abbots decision like good news. I'm glad get second dose tomorrow. all. 

That seems extreme me. Children nannied got COVID 24-48 hours. Runny nose mild fever. effects children mildly, vaccinate them? reason could understand spreading adults. Even so, long term effects vaccine unknown. Experimenting children different. cannot really ""consent,"" since caregivers make decisions them. death sentence man. Unfortunately not. referring “berekens aantal”, includes calculated number shots given family doctors, based deliveries received. right number (which much lower) includes GGDs operated vaccination centers hospitals, I’m referring all-in. Seems allowing vaccines exported time importing really good strategy! knew?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* unacceptable . Governments declare themselves.

Either: farcical yo-yo restrictions / suspended rights temporary condition way vaccination June 2021.

Or live less permanent state restrictions. 

If latter, begin building capacity handle many Covid patients health care system let disease burn us. 

Getting back normal
As quickly possible
Is emerging real health crisis need get clear eyed that.

If vaccinations solution. Let virus do. may kicked head horse. storage medical information governed privacy laws.

And you’re saying shouldn’t let businesses refuse service someone based non protected reason? enforce that? What’s penalty? legal grounds?

Basically, you’re arguing vaccinated bear cost stupidity unvaccinated. thing free, works it’s demonstrated safe. It’s unethical people continue putting others risk getting it, way around. even close true. Well wife allergies, contacted via email vaccination CDC that’s email. also requested sign study basically. (Daily texts reporting status). 

So I’m relaying email said, since she’s apparently part now. never got email since allergies. vaccine dates you! Curious, notice quinch thirst? drank gallon water 1.5-2hrs first shot! helps, 25% highest I’ve seen recent surveys. Saw another one said 13% end March. even look like refused leave last 200 years, resulting inevitable repeat cousin-fuckin there....of state general pretty high bar reach overtake first place. cannot open borders every case pops requires lockdown. Faaaaar normal ask me. get fever? Every time get fever, brings bad fever headache, inevitably triggers migraine. gotten fever, would fine. exactly mean 'don't trust government'? bloody vaccine manufactured private pharma companies. Vaccines part parcel human life take time birth. Seriously antivaccers dumbest people planet. Non taken, fair enough. Im lucky live live, dosent need throwing peoples faces. Oh ok interesting. yes easier men, since gay men 3000 tines higher chance acquire infection, probably women.

But thank pointing out, know US solely responsible vaccinating world?

How bout New Zealand? They're crown jewel covid, surely help? No? US? guess never checked Israel's data. 

It obvious almost reached herd immunity.

[קורונה - לוח Aside travel countries, that's exactly do. Medical information rightfully strictly guarded privacy laws. mind? Look brazil. ""spreading fast"" look them, 4000 daily deaths climbing months Bolsonaro thinks covid fake. news? post article gor every elderly gets vaccine now? Marburg completely independent within EU 

Is yet? 
Even recently March 21st press statements say uses global supply chain.  components production arrive global supply chain dramatically expanded last 12 months. 

Implementing complete ban exports supply chain sufficiently internal risky, better keep everything open working fast possible reserve something like 50% internal use i.e. entire output Marburg plant. Yes? say VP Biontech?

I mean, lie it? vaccinated Netherlands, advise AstraZeneca change, counting moment. single GP-vaccination included number gave, though tens thousands vaccinated GP’s per week. expect corrected days. ""covid scent detection"" dogs...nice easy way put maximal amount drug dogs scene. supply shortage Europe fortunately going away month onwards, vaccines new production capacity coming online. better limited speed administering jabs supply, easier faster fix.

Take heart, I'm sure Netherlands pick soon! probably allergies point CDC specific addresses children reason. ok long severe. 

I think I'm going go it, I'd rather sick get minor cold go get vax get side effects. Little chance Covid already first vax usual Covid symptoms. Well Netherlands Belgium also 2 densly populated countries Europe. find exports 4 million doses, know site track exports? thing, employers MANDATE shot means remaining employed, employers healthcare insurers DEMAND IT. Health Insurers also fully vaccinated discount premiums (raising non-vaccinated 100%). market offer solutions. Schools already deny access students fully vaccinated. hand, Japan money, puts near top line get vaccine US companies US finishes vaccinating population. anything, available supply vaccine distributed according demand vaccine. equal uptake demand, would proportional population. areas less uptake demand, need less vaccine, more. Without vaccines, yes need zero COVID go back normal, get need keep way.

These two exclude other.

If need keep country locked rest world, back normal. comparison us (the Netherlands) France, numbers seem pretty decent. 

How come see many Germans complain numbers? Ofcourse ~220.000 cases way good, half cases whilst 1/4th 1/5th population. Loving headlines. worried see numbers like July, ramping like April music ears. Also shows folks willing ready get shot comes. liveblog. Go specific message. updated post correction 8 p.m.

Here separate source: ""AstraZeneca halveert deze week opnieuw voorziene vaccinlevering, eerste Janssen-vaccins mogelijk wel vervroegd | Binnenland | hln.be"" moved April 19th delivery April 16th delivery (so next week already). We've never developed vaccine let alone 2 working efficient vaccines short amount time like experts giving like 3 years minimum beginning goes show right people behind enough money get f****** working vaccines made short amount time. could get started working new antibiotics completely resistance humans that'd great.. Mine open 5 day person since January, one high risk, keep home vaccinated. also, current spread b117 insane. 

which kinda sad think hand, countries need insofar handled public health side things well, there's disease within borders.

So delay vaccination ideal least people getting ill dying disease interim. Meanwhile vaccinating 50K per day Netherlands. Sure, free people, adjusted basis would vaccinate 3x much. Wish public would compare figures instead silly discussions vaccinated AstraZeneca. Ugh. 2d 10 days ago nothing sore arm. Almost makes wonder working. (Pfizer) problem UK black people Asians 

This comment went much better expecting areas, vaccine appointments taken.  areas leftover vaccine, need full allocation replenish stock next week.  Areas demand supply, put extra vaccine people arms. 

A surge one area mean demand vaccine area. suspect may mean, less demand. surge occurring people get vaccinated, also use masks avoid crowds.

They get antibodies hard way, instead easy way. one greatest legacies president hilarious completely downplayed whole covid virus probably remembered one greatest thing president whole presidency. People coming back disguise enjoyed experience took meds headache got worse. normal migraine meds. That's thought hospital thrown around. actually blood clot situation? started ease, along everything else.  Really, European book holiday then? Same! minor things like cures ton cancers

Just cure cancer, nothing major really. lunch might check ""world peace"" thing that's still unsolved. Lol France calm? poster child rioting. riot sake rioting! approaching US speed vaccinations. Good Job Germany! believe official advice sick get vaccine. really think virus reschedule. 

That said, personally would probably assume allergies go anyway feeling fine otherwise. Cintas center Xavier bunch appointments. sure still do. Got J&amp;J vaccine last weekend. One week go!! J&amp;J supposed even less, I'm one know got it, worst side effects anyone know. almost took hospital, bad shape. count lol. worry you

doubt power Edward_the_Sixth

lol EU what's best people would neer total stop exports.

The EU best people would involved spending last year setting factories, way US UK did. Instead EU spent time sitting backsides.  250 persons age 17 died us covid

Buzzard's guts, man. divide 250 17 USA population... get answer mom got vax pretty bad cold time. She’s fine. Bite bird loser bot second shot week ago scheduled awhile back, got cvs appointment 5 people vaccination appointment time. Ah yes. US never banned export. forced every supplier contracts binding sell us first long us outstanding orders. call export ban forced clauses contracts, whatever. Actually it’s mostly Republican men Remember UK vaccinating months anything noticed. Germany/Austrian/Norway found link first. also gave jab younger people first.

As younger people seem risk blood clots AZ, would need know breakdown Janssen make fair comparison. Also, awareness happens, reporting biases could increase number people lookout paying attention. might surprise people show without it. 

""Oops, left home. course can't miss wedding!""

I've read enough reddit posts know family love ignore rules. suppose depends definition ""at risk.""

There millions Americans age 50+ vaccinated yet would consider risk moment vast majority children, given way acute COVID outcomes play age.

In another 6 months, they'll probably *more* risk large swaths adults given likely unvaccinated status exactly size risk can't accurately say, risk personal assessment. Understandable. Hedging worst case blessing curse. That's funny, friend got JJ vaccine jealous still rare done 3 weeks sooner. He's living dream, licking doorknob wants 😞. Nah it’s going months now. actually got fucking extended May 6th [A later study failed replicate authors later paper think authors original paper using enough sanitizer completely cover surfaces. Youyang Gu basically saying thing, focus much herd immunity, get vulnerable vaccinated idea grim stateside; entire government falling apart civil unrest boiling point literal insurrection attempted. Biden sleepy moderate bugger progressive wasn’t thrilled about, shaping best US President 21st century listening scientists acknowledging minorities human beings. Trump, wet fart would done less damage country sort proposed carrot get vaccine-hesitant change minds. see vaccine hesitancy high people initially thought, probably issue. incentives like free donuts gift cards probably work better, easier implement. Yes. Children young adults always vulnerable COVID-19. hospitalized much, much lower rate age &amp; risk groups, still happens. they’re unvaccinated group, it’s going highlight people groups severe covid requiring hospitalization even intubation.

This flu, it’s never flu. still remains dangerous virus anyone isn’t immune. We're going reach low rates transmission many people remaining unvaccinated. Even relative risk vaccinated unvaccinated high, pooled risk among hundreds people crater much impact cost insuring entire pool employees, especially high risk severe disease likely vaccinated.

Health insurers generally can't charge individual based health status. issues one. noting walgreens vaccines. went website wife got ours. definitely useful site, check directly. got extended May 6th Andrew Cuomo. actually think great wake call lots countries, need learn it. Global free trade market forces works exceedingly well, times good. soon threat populations, countries going prioritize citizens (rightfully so) means rely external resources provide citizens, going get fucked. hope triggers reviews national capabilities we're lacking, effectively create industries something potentially worse happens, wait hat hand. Bit shitty thing boast export 0 vaccines import absolute fuck ton Right, playing kids one trillion times important small kids mask annoyance. Segregate antivaxxers community... either detention facility excluding school, work, shopping, social activities. choices create danger others... must draw line. bet lot suddenly find aren’t afraid getting vaccinated thought. 

As long elevate people’s right freedom everything else, continue live unhealthy, narcissistic culture people don’t feel sense obligation other. cons given crooks another way people’s bank accounts, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, President Biden name acting chair Federal Trade Commission, said interview Washington Post. American Rescue Plan, signed Biden March 11, $24 million went fund full-time employees FTC address unfair deceptive acts practices, including related coronavirus. think kinds scams particularly target communities color especially pernicious doubling disparities we’re seeing across board health outcomes economic fallout basically everything associated pandemic.  wife received first dose Wednesday. Second dose first week May! also live Cincinnati. go Walgreens Dayton find one. got :)  actually not. source supposed ban? recent statement White House press secretary:

""We purchase AstraZeneca supplies. there's export prohibitions vaccine manufacturers United States free export products also fulfilling terms contracts US government,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters daily news conference.

She said company work country around world purchase vaccine supply. ""And certainly, something US government would directly engaged with. terms supply, purchased first focus, primary focus vaccinating American people. we've conveyed publicly privately well,"" Psaki said.

There difference export ban—which exist—and United States choosing (for now) use vaccines purchased US citizens. I've waiting big drop cases Illinois soon, we're getting towards 60% least one dose Thanks clarification! good see positive outlook :) would vaccines enough... would enough vaccines aren’t??? Uhhh, mean socialized medicine government funded fight capitalism forcing Americans work 500,000 deaths? May need buy dictionary know words mean Huh? would stop sa variant becoming dominant spreading others eliminated immunity? I'm saying perfect argument. I'm saying companies profiting this. think complicated simply ""just let anyone, anywhere produce vaccine"". think may valid concerns small companies poorer countries may technical capacity know-how make quality vaccines. Pandemics last years. months. Even though vaccines, fully vetted, know long term effects them. virus us forever. mutates perfectly mutating wrong direction humans safe. variant going resistant vaccines. vindictive? bad us, de loping countries. pretty fucked AZ/J&amp;J. saving grace might Novavax Yes, would real win agree that's world live in, could been, anybody else blame ourselves. hope so. want emotionally prepared less desirable scenario happens, especially J&amp;J vaccine plant issue last year huge likelihood cause shortages. Counterpoint: Assuming access vaccine, company shouldn’t hook testing. 

People free refuse vaccine, employers obligation risk health workers customer choice. everyone, including myself, using adjusted figures

Why would calculate numbers publicly available shows relative differences 1) received vaccines 2) vaccine manufacturer differences. NL received AZ vaccines compared DE, DN many countries relative population.

A larger share AZ vaccine cost vaccines impact vaccination rate due restrictions agegroups. 

It important dig data instead claiming something true.

Source:  happen getting J&amp;J shot. told likely ran 10k prior didn’t get enough water. How’s ur curfew going? vaccines bought paid for. Denmark invested 418m vaccine research.

Is enough, want tell reasons deserve get shafted? That’s really simplest way put it.

By at-risk populations either vaccinated refuse get vaccinated, get certain age lethality COVID **plummets**. hospital bed occupancy lowers, start removing restrictions. medical professionals hesitant lower level positions. It’s bit different.

The US already manufacturing mRNA vaccines inject people’s arms.

This doesn’t happen almost anywhere else. number people willing fake passport less number people would get vaccine participate life. Even half 25% get vaccine passports puts us 87% vaccinated way enough everyone access (remarkably effective) vaccines, expect sympathy choose still endanger family plummet zero.

Perhaps they'll discover communities disproportunately afflicted, science vaccines sound, partisan information sources suspect. perhaps world incrementally fewer willfully ignorant, small net benefit going forward face much greater threats like climate crisis. *squints insane death toll America Covid* Okay, obviously richest country earth helps certain degree racist Asians. good people. Well, pretty likely rate keep going link comes people's attention, like happened AZ europe (if link). I'm trying defend Bill Gates way, merely suggesting may legitimate reasons quality control complex system may important.

Also, blatant Russian propaganda, podcast hardly primary source topic. netherlands already stopped lockdown made record breaking proffit. small hand pump use everyone touches... Yeah, I've felt relationship sour last years sure. used light natured ribbing sides respected closest neighbor/ally/etc. like brothers would fight, KNEW back shit went down.

I think kind lost (I mention here) 4 years Trump. Trump kind shit Canada, called us national security threat, treated us like adversary (while heaping praise North Korea Russia). I'm sure news stories get traction south (because frankly y'all important shit worry about) really amped bitterness Canadians. 

I'm defending saying they're right, sure could sense shift. like national sense of... betrayal took over. like little bit awkward nerdy kid grown cool kid throughout school best friends like kindergarten, one day decides completely ignore talk shit everyone. People wanted lash feeling.

That said, really hope point relationship restored, guys could crush us military economy perspective, really think countries historically special. Interesting! drink good amount water typical day amazed much thirst truly had. Definitely going hydrated second dose! struggled find common thing Google search, glad hear seems norm it. curious, vaccinated? long?

Search appointments online get one April over. wait state call in. I'd hazard guess HIV prevalent could major reason behind deaths. nations allowed stop citizens returning? Obviously can't 100% block, user suggestion block essential workers/services kinda ridiculous. Regardless ""wikipedia"" defines vaccine hesitancy, reality spectrum people may jump get vaccine.

There hard core anti-vax folks take matter what. larger group far anti-vaccine, concerns whatever reason want ""first"" line.

In personal experience, folks fall ""granola"" category regardless political alignment. Folks eat vegan, organic, free-range, fair-trade etc. think come around see friends serious side-effects. BNT/Pfizer, AZ Moderna used Germany mean given we've managing flu many years, undoubtedly keep managing COVID foreseeable future. manage debate. Add rural situation Mississippi. Many places drive 30min hour get hospital. enough outreach smaller communities usually older, poorer less opportunity get hospital vaccine site.

This sounds like time copy Indian Reservations did. Going people. case, understandably used J&amp;J, since easier transport required one dose (one trip). friends bring remind COVID knocked ass 3 weeks still haven’t fully recovered months later. I’m sure really convincing vaccine hesitant people race get vaccinated!  HIV costs excluded find person use condom? Two different things. Israel still lot restrictions, likely cases fall 50%-60% immune restrictions still place, need 80%-ish go completely restriction-free. state open general population April 19th, I’m honestly expecting get point May August.

I totally understand hedging long end window, might surprised quickly get become eligible. became eligible state Monday I'm getting first dose tonight. stay CVS appointment site like hawk make happen, thought going looking May-June first dose, I'd scheduling week initial eligibility.

Unfortunately, place went J&amp;J. alternatives. would preferred efficacy reasons. course blame country taking care first. fully entirely reject anything right moral current system vaccine distribution.

I illusions current trajectory distribution going change, really wish people would critical things are, be.

The current mechanism vaccine distribution need like this. hope next crisis, lot better. German confirm. Germans incredibly pessimistic. reason believe daily vaccinations slow significantly next weeks. Quite contrary, two weeks weekly doses triple GPs. way GP got 1 vaccine :D get ~15 40 doses. Depending many GPs area compared population. 16 year old died Quebec week. Even broke clock right twice day. could canada Reddit moment J&amp;J vaccine investigated blood clots  Taters? What's taters precious?  Jesus man. people like leave room debate. empathy millions upon millions lives ruined shutdown. saying opening earlier would right move sure even allow discussed without calling people murderers? days expected tho. We're receiving many doses April Jan-Mar combined really think genetics. Whenever ask fossils secret say something different. agree different Bhutan Seychelles. 

But comment said Gibraltar part UK, true. That's responding to. local sub get death threats even suggesting variants might possibly make kids sick. Yeah think need send Michigan right now. benefits everyone could get control. Getting covid likely unsafe long-term, I’ve never long-term negative reaction vaccine past, I’m putting personal chips vaccine. Lol ok. thought place Hookworm detected US since least late 1970s Lowndes County, Alabama 2017. meant already standard, even rural south, Kroger/walmart/publix/ingles years pandemic. assumed since common rural south would've every area around time us. People created equal. I've know liberals continued social lives conservatives haven't. wasn’t total cluster. already hitting 1 million vaccinations day Jan 19-20. 50 million unused doses country. Certainly would make sense put use area getting hit hard leave sitting shelves. really think depends live even time day. never seen mask compliance local store less 95% live sticks. big box store major MI city week every single person mask busy.

My local outbreak currently fueled local high schools. Work arm - stuff arm (and massage right shot, although ship sailed 1), less sore tomorrow. You’re assuming UK results due vaccinations snd strict lockdown they’ve US in... I'm 1 5 :D Thank god that! Otherwise we'd find golf course somewhere rather Office. forgetting protein subunit vaccines, still much play. Novavax vaccine made proteins grown moth cells (plus adjuvant) stable regular refrigeration temperatures. also seems effective best vaccines have. know. country, Chile, president fined least two times appearing one without mask walking without mask beach pay call accountable bullshit done country. could say quite bit since I'm US. Can't wait takes like go away. petered US media recently hope also peter Canadian media soon enough. post mistake Lol wait 2022 elections half idiots country give back senate house republicans. Following news, grown there. Outside metropolitan areas, especially northern part, extremely conservative. Aug 2019. place blanketed Trump signs. hear many times proud pronouncement ""this Trump country"".  pandemic hit, screeching 'just flu' deafening. fairly hostile too. experience, conservatives problem screaming parking lot, coughing you, generally jerk. know, hoax make Trump look bad.  

Leave Detroit airport head north. many small towns Detroit Grand Rapids. definitely sight see. like two different worlds. Free ice cream vaccine. like it. downplayed absolute shit awhile, continued downplay stock market pride. even called denocrat hoax early on. Every day inaction allowed spread further. worst possible kind person president pandemic. He's sociopath, genuinely care happens people. He's incapable empathy. Nope afraid. one nearly clots occurred first dose. all. Yea, pretty encouraged this. Seems like week it'll down, one would think week it'll week it'll really good. 2 week bump road, compared pretty much rest world right totally fine. YES PLEASE! mistake.
1. Use vaccines vaccinate risk people countries 
2. Kids high risk achieve low levels virus without vaccinating kids (look Israel) Remember last time asked 2 weeks? Luckily point still stands regards snide nature comment Thank framing way. I’m definitely calmed it. basically passed receiving shot, think edge seems like vaccine distribution could use tweaking cases spiking Michigan, everyone California driving Bakersfield, thousands doses left unused states like Mississippi Kentucky. easy get 0.7 billion Germans vaccinated within 2021 true. Vaccines ramping big time. Age 16+ get one starting week. call 'plug chug'. definitely ability outdoors better ventilation. like cases died rapidly back may/June (at least NJ), cases drop warmer weather. thing decrease can't get complacent. buy us time vaccinate change weather fall California actually 22 million. less 2000 confirmed cases hospital right 475 ICU. 300 suspected cases hospital along 43 suspected ICU. Lowest numbers since late March 2020. hope correct! Alright, I’ll take bit easier today I’m confused people always say case numbers don’t matter? know deaths important metric still think case numbers matter shows much virus still circulating. missing something? Seems like major government overreach could go Lowes entire spring lockdown. many times. literally split upper lower peninsulas believe lives matter, even Red ones. faced tsunami re-prioritize save many ppl possible. Even California ultra-low 1% positivity wait couple weeks vials helps Michigan. source number pull ass? LOL, parents fully vaccinated already taken two vacations. stopping people going back normal. Depending hard work I'd little cautious. Adding exhaustion muscle fatigue side effects would probably pretty miserable. don’t think that’s great comparison. haven’t flue shot years mostly laziness I’m crazy shots. still got covid vaccine soon could. 


Obviously that’s anecdotal evidence I’m pretty sure I’m alone. Even without actual data logic behind it. You’re right covid vaccine resistance also urgency importance. We’ll see factors meaningful. things, location matters. Also, shots increase folks getting second doses.

NY times axtually published article Mississippi this:.. 

""When comes getting coronavirus vaccine, Mississippi residents abundance options. Thursday, 73,000 slots state’s scheduling website, 68,000 Tuesday.

In ways, growing glut appointments Mississippi something celebrate: reflects mounting supplies prompted states across country open eligibility anyone 16.

But public health experts say pileup unclaimed appointments Mississippi exposes something worrisome: large number people reluctant get inoculate""....

""The hesitancy national implications. Experts say 70 percent 90 percent Americans must vaccinated country reach herd immunity, point virus longer spread population""

Signs pointing get herd immunity vaccines alone. vaccines plus 20-30% population contracting covid... Sure case count death rate originally brought commented on.

I idea would feel ""guilty"" case count death rate anyway. Unless involved Trump Administration Anti-Vaxxer / Anti-Masker likely bear responsibility things. take OTC pain relievers shot, reason said, health experts say avoid get vaccine \*might\* lower efficacy.

I'm clarifying statement ""it lowers efficacy"", since \*not\* known contradictory evidence. I'm ""peddling stupid advice"", I'm pointing nuanced declarative statement, people feel need take medications know exactly recommend premedication ibuprofen Tylenol COVID-19 vaccines due lack data impacts vaccine-induced antibody responses,” Simone Wildes, infectious disease specialist South Shore Medical Center Massachusetts, [told pre-pandemic [survey looked effect children (with vaccines) showed significant. authors asked simple question — taking OTC painkillers vaccination reduce efficacy children? answer no. /s got nearly 50% vote circumstances. Imagine pandemic happen, happen year later, even handled ounce sense, would still white house today. assume this?

There almost selective pressure sars-cov2 now. immunescape variants seen far region 50% population infected.

B117 purely fitter selection signs immunescape. replicate 10x faster therefore spreads 40-70% faster simply outcompeted old variants.

The worst thing assume enough people vaccinated pandemic over. best case correct. Worst case get full vaccine escaping variants around world real second wave gets started pandemic, might even harder control first wave. seen full vaccine escaping variants vitro 90 days.

We sure much careful people act right now. game. People plant gardens May Michigan bc weather. could buy seeds time thing could do.  Lol right. michigander assure antimaskers antivaxxers, think ""higher level"" states. could wrong that's anecdotal experience Uh, no. snows April. Even near Detroit sometimes. People plant tomatoes May Michigan. LOL least wait full FDA approval? Congrats! need optimistic people world, us pessimists sometimes proven right. conservative approach vaccinate everyone soon possible hope best, plan worst. Well people think things want like go restaurant, bar, gym, concert, etc. kids normally involved.

However think important get kids activities like sports back running ASAP since important part lives. ""Biden leans heavily Trump's 'Warp Speed' give credit""

Literally title article. 

L. Oh. L vaccinated want go beach vaccine? problem US prioritizing citizens vaccinated?

They’re manufacturing vaccines US paying money imported, issue again? give EO read again, particularly Section 1. Americans given priority access vaccines ""procured United States Government"", domestic production.

The Biden White House reiterated [no formal vaccine export vaccine manufacturers United States free export products also fulfilling terms contracts U.S. government. saying get vaccines. got it! /s Including last president.  total death toll account better per capita paying attention real lockdowns Europe, you?

Since need grass seed carrot seed Michigan March? don't. damn cold use stuff. snowed opening day Tiger baseball season year give idea. data showing vaccine hesitancy specifically vaccine “penetration”, among two specific populations. 

The first data point likely point failures reaching accessible vaccines eldery POC (eg. more/less likely living multi-gen homes vs care/community facilities? access transpo?) 

The second metric resolves question access, difficult generalize given specific dynamics group (including larger average % relatively recent immigrants POC HC worker community). 

Not saying aren’t directly trends data, need look number little closely/critically see specifically results indicate. expect reduction 1/5th daily new cases now... right? spring surge Antibodies ( vaccine induced viral induced) cross blood brain barrier

Apologies stupid question, T-cells and/or aspects immune system cross BBB cut risk undetected covid infection brain? title sorta looks like we're suggesting slightly brutal solution problem. didn’t say ended, stats impact. Scott Gottlieb (on board pfizer) recently said would expect little month EUA. 

So would guess toward end middle end May. probably want play safe. Operation Warp Speed? fumbled lot things least that. We'll never know wonder things would've gone Hillary. surely would much stronger emphasis social distancing, masks, lockdowns, sure would've landed vaccines. Might like Canada Trudeau. Strong mitigation, weak vaccine. Last year would've better/less deadly, might well worse now.  problem proof infection alternative vaccine negative test run risk people organizing ""covid parties"" deliberately infect get ""proof infection"". Welp, first confirmed blood clot AstraZenca dose Mexico, million applied, people freaking out. Damn media, real, damn you. Exactly. guy know half time :( Got shot #2 today. Thank you, science right. American, feel guilty make astronomical number total cases dead international embarrassment. fact, let's take pride like sounds like telling do. Cases also dropped consistently “pause” December January (which didn’t go far done March-April 2020). Anecdotally, I've seen nightly news NBC CBS reporting recently.

Ninja edit: would US. Nobody hates America like Americans Reddit fun! even freeing start things vaccine series done 'kicked in' knowing things safely can. 28% 2366 hospitalized LA County. LA County's case rate still pretty high... cases per 10k population rival levels states swept Spring Surge. think resistant group going smaller lot people saying. Telling poll don’t plan getting vaccine doesn’t automatically make part group. already seen percentage people saying won’t get drop quite bit.  people get social work restrictions unvaccinated people show lot give it. Eventually we’ll get true anti-vaxers aren’t 30% country. thanks! wonder much aid US sends whatever country Germany responsible creation one vaccines. Yet despite that, they're celebrating record 700,000 shots single day, 1/5 US right 1/6 gone 500,000 700,000 past week. Still pace far behind US. 

It means US....has gobbling vaccines.  also want discount advantages rich country infrastructure. Developing countries uphill battle hope US start helping countries able vaccinate majority population. even find ways without compromising rollout. I've actually seen commercials hulu advertising taking ""pandemic activities"" ""trips covid"" google commercial

*cough* NJ beach towns normally fully open everything Memorial day, memory serves right. field hospital used, definitely morgue trucks used El Paso areas. Hey let’s speak soon; cases rising majority states. 😫I’m sure won’t many hospitalizations deaths though, good thing. Looks like vaccines proving pretty effective.

You business! 😁 kept waiting u tell everyone calls u freak washing ur hands (not rinsing w water).

Except get sick time. 🤢 Cause young kids. know, things r immune Covid pass disease EXCEPT Covid. long open schools, I'll keep dirty fingers firmly inside ears. 🙄 Oh wow. Good find! 

More proof vaccinations working. ICU numbers continue improve hospitalizations way less severe. 

This good news! Yeah, fine. also flexibility get best day want. Like could get Friday weekend recover. got mine yesterday literally cannot stop sucking dicks autistically. get close. People forget 16 make like 20% population. remaining 80% population, reach 70% eligible adults, we'll lucky get 55-60% nation start plateauing off.

It's possible happens pandemic, yet, least manner genetic testing picked up. Guys took 1st Moderna month ago sore arm little bit fatiuge. took 2nd dose yesterday holy shit hellish. slightly sore arm felt like someone ran back truck. crazy hallucinations night pillows talking crazy shit like that. felt like drugs. got 3 hours sleep cycle dehydrated, drinking water, getting pee every 10 mins repeating. shit literally hell.

Ultimately, everyone different thus different experience asked google city gave this:


Los Angeles city located California. 2020 population 4,015,940, largest city California 2nd largest city United States. Los Angeles currently growing rate 0.32% annually population increased 5.89% since recent census, recorded population 3,792,620 2010. every adult wants one, cases drop dramatically, risk kids quite low. There’s IMPENDING DOOM! Yes, famously local chain CVS. I'll never forget watching official White House televised press briefing early stages quarantine, reporter asked Trump (paraphrased) ""We hundreds dead, thousands hospitalized, millions citizens confused worried. say Americans watching right scared?""

&amp;#x200B;

Trump's response "" say terrible reporter that's I'll say.""

&amp;#x200B;

Jesus Christ man, say non-sense mumbo jumbo American spirit staying united together. Say shit strong resilient are. Say something best scientists doctors world working 24 hours day this. say SOMETHING PRESIDENTIAL. no, Trump set ego literally 5 seconds midst worldwide emergency whole country watching edge seat waiting sliver leadership.

&amp;#x200B;

This small example. short, yes, firmly believe America could've gone different route someone else office. guidance, comforting words, leadership. alone would've helped us stay united spirit focus, even timeline virus vaccine stayed same. that’s like highly unlikely really. got unlucky. 6-8 days exposure ideal. would say 5-6 days last contact probably best time frame get tested 2-3 days symptoms start. Leave Texas alone, 49 states great union. Cant piece pie without everyone talking it?  It’s impossible know exactly would’ve gone without Trump office. early Pandemic US population fairly cooperative restrictions Trump started sowing doubt calling reopen economy. might island nation, we’re surrounded oceans two sides country densely populated. early actions downplaying butterfly effect knows many lives could’ve saved. course, know virus early thought, probably community spread would’ve inevitable, think impeached trump tweeting sidelines would’ve distraction, wouldn’t real power. Maybe Twitter would’ve banned early since wouldn’t holding public office anymore, limiting efforts spread misinformation. 

Could pence fucked too? knows, stand front podium say “please listen CDC people, job” let heavy lifting. knows much lower death count would be.

One absolutely needed flight, j&amp;j hard find got one couple miles away. He's done it, folks! Yes. got Pfizer shot. say though, I'd rather deal day feeling sick risking weeks hospital die. wanted sure followed subreddit rules posted it. [rules actually say anything contents supposed posted -- talks how, do, what. story questionable here? Well DTAP around 80%, negativity see covid vax matching influenza vax 69% vulnerable, aged 65+.

Remember new vaccine people resist due that.

I expect at-risk group possibly reach 85% cohorts come close number.

ETA vary geographical area different percentages everywhere making possible pockets exist continue mutations, making future vax kind guesstimate like flu vax. got second Pfizer two days ago still haven’t felt side effects, I’m really happy since seemed like everyone online like 100+ fevers such. Hopefully go same! Nice send us Pfizer Canada please 25% adults said won’t get vaccine.

You number high. I'd interested got number from. Probably outdated source. know threw bunch info really don’t want discourage you. It’s great you’re helping part solution. You’re proactive that’s wonderful, especially given age.

this America know AMERICAN 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 🇺🇸 received 2 shots moderna vaccine, I’m 2nd day 2nd shot. woke fatigue warmer, long side effects last? Every province territory unique relationship federal government; antagonistic others. Quebec known pointedly self-advocating, parts Canada way too. pretty clear: “Linking test results comprehensive database COVID-19 deaths, estimated B.1.1.7 infection associated 55% (95% confidence interval 39–72%) higher mortality compared strains SARS-CoV-2 time period.” agree masks part Trump US President could shut anything, it’s local/state govs highly doubt we’ll see additional restrictions either. Hell, barely enforce ones we’ve got. know. frustrating. soon antibodies kick in, I'm planning volunteer connect people appointments transport them.

Have tried vaccinefinder website? perfect, little better guessing might it. Also, friends luck appearing CVS final appointment time getting unused doses. Good luck! bought early, hedged bets deals multiple producers, haggle much price, helped sure. actual rollout ups downs (which always going case country acts like 50 'mini countries' cases like this) really solid far state. still skeptical Olympics going happen time tell. Yup. personally know someone died covid fully vaccinated (and yes, 85+ comorbidities). anecdotal edge case, enough break ""100%"" figure.

And really, *anything* 100%? always outliers real world. Pretty wild getting downvoted saying this. Pfizer filing 12 15 year olds! low-risk group given age WFH flextime job pattern. I'd get J&amp;J one dose give another morning afternoon wait line get another shot. JNJ getting prevalent Baltimore area. offered appointment JNJ weekend town pass. booked separate appointment week half unsure I’ll offered time Got Moderna 2 days ago. Still can't lift left arm. Felt bad yesterday actually caught covid months ago.

But please let discourage you. small price pay, case unusual. reasons fully vaccinated continue precautions mostly social.

This mostly right. *In communities established herd immunity*. 95% efficiency means there’s 1 20 chance vaccine doesn’t work you’re around others haven’t vaccinated, 1 20 isn’t good enough. It’s good enough everyone around 1 20 chance, too

So, go ahead small gathering you’re confident everyone vaccinated don’t jump immediately going concerts quite yet got second Pfizer two days ago little nervous, literally felt completely normal day yesterday. even headache. hope haha counties? J

U

S

T 7,000 new cases. urging gets ""pushback"" Restaurant Association. 60 countries approved Sputnik V emergency use. vaccinated Walgreens (USA) late March. Every appointment lasted 90 seconds. standing outside door saw quick turnaround was. Filling form took longer vaccination itself. 

He asked arm, sat pulled sleeve, swabbed arm injected needle, said thanks, handed vaccination card printouts vaccine received seek medical care, told wait around 15 minutes case reaction. So, bought drink coupon gave sat car. 

It easiest thing ever. would've loved drive-through clinic, took whatever could get fastest. 

Very efficient easy process even walk-in.

I signed first second dose time - online days first dose. like type analysis. many factors consider percent people vaccinated, like lockdowns, past infections, seasonality, maybe even luck. yeah lol sort vindication free market Lol, people refusing vaccination change behavior 2020 anyway, still change them. :|  literally heard moron say that, like yesterday, real. Yes, I'm aware that.

I guess much assume other's realized aware everyone constantly COVID saved ""(if come contact COVID)"" worried someone would think understand viral loading thing I'd explain I'm aware tag need exposed certain levels virus catch it. guess ""(relative unvaccinated peers)"" would easier way say probably would avoided issues.

Yeah, right state there's 1500 new cases per day. Let's assume there's 3 day window caught cases ID'd 10 day window undiagnosed cases, we'll say 1:1 ratio days (probably low-balling there). gives us 19,500 people it. 5.7M people state. 0.3% chance one them. (ignoring whether one vaccinated) Now, there's math want bother figuring I'm lazy, portion 19,500 people vaccinated. leaving masks on, they're reducing spread others. Meanwhile live Canada stores refusing serve people wear masks NioNtech Pfizer said many future projects together. NioNtech develop medicine Pfizer going testing paperwork. always found interesting people complained lockdowns killing non-essential small businesses also upset Home Depot Walmart blocked number non-essential items. George Washington implemented quarantines entire cities prevent spread disease. Trump made wearing masks problem base. say someone else wouldn’t helped nuts. Well Im already living fact. fact saying isnt true. Im feeling fine far. latest flu shot gave soreness years past, also soreness either Pfizer dose.  EU gonna vaccinated hell lot faster countries. can't simply compare countries ahead act like lagging behind ""the rest world"". nothing covid19 vaccine. earlier collaboration influenca vaccine. Pfizer Biontech profit sharing agreement place covid19 vaccine though. adults said won’t get vaccine.

Unscientifically, I'd guess good portion people already covid. probably help things. Information. GP told mom today. im sure really possible get producers mixed up. Maybe mom remembered wrong. shes actually old yet :D probable need vaccinate kids achieve herd immunity.

Considering kids large percentage population UK variant likely original virus infect children. zero way achieve herd immunity without immunizing children mention longer children go unimmunized simply bodies virus mutate even dangerous variant. Yes. apparently PPE shortages reported hospitals beginning impactful may thought. That’s good thing.

Remember PPE isn’t limited healthcare workers. believe consistent message dangers mask wearing well contradicting medical professionals would better.

Hell weird stuff like Trump allegedly asking really dumb questions damage control said things like disappear Easter would allowed people work instead trying figure ways get listen care. don’t really need wait even long, restrictions already gone point. yeah, get point vaccines available month, restrictions inexcusable. currently vaccines data much transmission reduced, one point travel restrictions lifted many people vaccinated still infectious travelling around. That, 4/5 fully vaccinated, 2/3 even partially.

When 3/5 fully + natural immunity due recoveries, cases minimal. Oh ya it’s mini 2 day vacation coastal town 1.5 hours driving distance lol. county 2020 suicides 2 statistically insignificant (and record) overdoses 10 put us par 2016. Yet deaths 2019 record around 2900 new record around 3600 pretty much line Covid deaths. 

Yet everyone bitching throughout “the cure worse disease, epidemic suicides, overdoses like never seen before”. couldn’t fathom going Chili’s wearing mask sitting right top eachother. Getting second shot Monday, can’t wait! Think it’s probably 50/50 coworkers whether getting not. amazing Americans get shit safety nets, made fun it. Yet, Americans, helped developed vaccine invested heavily money, send doses countries first. 

It's every country what's right first, look help others. US sending doses throughout world soon enough. hospital work make us wipe chairs ER anyone sits them. three waiting areas triage area. theatre since day 1  elderly parents (that basically comorbidities) live GF still symptoms long COVID like 10 months later. two weeks us fully vaccinated. amount stress anxiety lifted shoulders huge say least.

At least based experiences, friends never get flu shot jumped COVID vaccine.

I personally never get flu shot either get flu like symptoms days it’s guaranteed day two work. I’d rather roll dice actual flu since haven’t gotten years.

Happy cake day! :)  Probably comes across pedantic. believe messaging important speak 100% absolutes, nay sayers always exaggerate outliers. seems like lot variance US states random, least due favors know of.

Warp Speed absolutely helped put us today, program really glorified pricy purchase order. absorbed financial risk vaccine developers told we’d buy whatever came with. looks like going end paying lot vaccine might never enter market get approved late. tested negative COVID-19

This horrible idea. Testing positive *lagging indicator*. People don’t test positive immediately infection infection 12 days positive test 12 days? take days exposed virus testing positive? part statement fair criticize obviously hyperbolic simplification skepticism local mitigation efforts.  

Yet it’s pretty clear vast majority kicking screaming along way disingenuous people proclaimed loudest haven’t even bothered look numbers something easily accessible coroner’s preliminary report came months ago. share people like “bro really knows believe anymore”. someone wanted bet would 200 deaths Covid last April burned out. dude still confident ever whatever bs assertion comes week week. 

People like sit call CDCs findings BS still yap really excess deaths America county basically easily verifiable 20% increase fatalities last 10 months 2020 (80% actually last 4 months).

I’ve heard help I’d concerned took medication still felt bad cases reported yesterday since February. We're 20% lows. That's upswing. Sure, tiny upswing relative January, still upswing. disappointing context 3 million vaccinations day. 

I literally said crisis. I'm melodramatic. midst 4th wave, especially regionally Northeast/east-Midwest. get told incredible uptake. need explain science suck him. syndrome pretty easily managed though. Good mom told 3 weeks first AZ shot would clear. Luck? “health pass” opinion totally worthless... why?

I’m talking apps let self report symptoms displays green red screen symbol.

Self reporting. Everyone selects whatever make sound healthy get in! winner TV reality show Survivor given prize million dollars every year since show started. That’s small amount money national budget.

Thank goodness Dolly Parton guess. Unfortunately infected decent level immunity built up, vaccine still effective, doctors displaying mild symptoms, another real world example vaccines high effacy regards protection severe illness death. fence post move, honest.

I guess according you, makes sense lump together groups difference hospitalizations 250%.

You make sound like 2.5x increase isn’t massive increase. Sure isn’t 13x, like death, 2.5x statistically large.

They shouldn’t grouped together like said. reason would disingenuous data post sensationalist nonsense. link paper scholar.google.com removed low quality.  
Um, okay. 
And even knows line “political” day day month month. surprises here, besides idea would perform research fairly close EUA 12-16 (like couple months away). mRNA vaccines late trials group one early results show nearly 100% efficacy.

Younger apparently fully enrolled trials honestly know process.

Regardless, Pfizer went Phase 3 start EUA 5 months (July 27, 2020 December 11, 2020). Without hiccups assuming timeline worse age groups, think would reasonable EUA September ages. point production bottleneck (in US) getting shots arms would expect mass vaccination pretty quick that. development risks may temporary. 

Not every single child get covid maintain restrictions, absurd. 

But lets assume 30% do. (20-30% may already). Roughly 75 million children US. Knock 16 17 year olds eligible vaccine call 70 million children unable get vaccine. 

So would 21 million infections 400ish deaths. 

I think acceptable loss. die car accidents typical year. 20-30 times die cause. 

It's easy say loss acceptable one actually acts like that. Every time drive car risking child's life. give driving save children?  absolutely crazy. Reuters one unbiased news sources (like AP), breitbart pretty much even news right wing. 

That professor stupid. would've complained dean needed use lot articles coursework. roughly figured Israel. 15% recovered 56% vaccinated = 71% immunity, herd immunity threshold.

I think likely least 30-40% US immunity covid exposed virus. Add 25-30% vaccinated we're getting point.

This would also explain falling numbers almost everywhere, including Texas lifted mask mandate. worried AZ JnJ vaccines causing blood clots? International borders still close. problem new strains increase Chance reinfection, see immunescape variants south africa Brazil. Therefore herdimmunity eradication virus unlikely achievable.

The idea vaccines get sars-cov2 point (long-term) becomes common cold everybody since virus completely unknown Immunsystem.

But end know mass vaccination lead pandemic. hope get control way realistic way go anymore.

Excerpt response, Brussels threatened [block exports Pfizer UK

...sourcing another article making mention whatsoever Pfizer (make quick CTRL + F believe me).

So, gives? vaccines approved US 100% effective severe cases/deaths.

This actually true. high percentage, 100%. know people fully vaccinated indeed ended hospital COVID. Again, vaccines hell job, 100%.

For future reference, studies done ""100%"" number came big problems. example, placebo control groups ALSO little two vaccine trials explicitly report hospitalizations efficacy outcome make latter issue clear. vaccine, one person control group severe COVID-19, eight people hospitalized; [Johnson &amp; 34 people placebo group severe COVID-19, five people hospitalized. It’s true zero vaccinated people hospitalized either study vaccines took effect. numbers small, can’t draw reliable conclusion high efficacy may outcomes. Diana Zuckerman National Center Health Research [pointed Johnson &amp; Johnson trial, **“It’s misleading tell public nobody vaccinated hospitalized unless also tell 5 people placebo group hospitalized.”** She’s right. can’t confident predicting effectiveness precisely wider population outside trial, either. example, vaccine trials included relatively people older 60 participants.  see fragile numbers looking compiled severe disease. [Pfizer example, one vaccinated person developed severe COVID-19 versus three placebo group—which meant single bout disease made difference calculated efficacy rate 66 percent one 100 percent\*\*.\*\* trials, zero people severe disease vaccinated group versus one control group, adding subtracting one would even dramatic. **The problem even greater deaths. efficacy analysis, two vaccine trials—for Moderna’s Johnson &amp; Johnson’s—reported COVID-19 deaths control groups.** don’t get this. communication there; people willfully aren’t looking accept whatever see Facebook, do? non self governing territory according UN.

March 2020 laughed told we're looking year half best case disagreed. shocking hear people say originally told 2 weeks. don’t think people realize multiple places sign vaccine online. husband originally going wait month get first shot, got tip CVS 40 minutes away able get today. searching appointments him, seeing less populated areas 30-60 minutes away open appointments. places densely populated areas longest waiting list. everyone luxury drive 1-2 hours round trip shot. husband took work today so.   I've seen one makes level confidence that's science works. one people got astrazeneca blood clots probably would hesitant going forward though, would relief found problem *now* problem expressed me. Oh know. professor Trump University. think it’s vaccinations lot people earlier Texas enough immunity virus hard time spreading. comes deaths people aren’t vaccinated low risk death. non American, admit USA pretty good job there. Well done! victim-blaming really on-point. looked joining local PTA Militia group? absolutely hated covid deniers, anti vaxxers, 99.99% survival rate, ‘covid flu’ , ‘masks don’t work’ crowd since day 1. cringe reading posts. see CDC say ‘don’t travel certain places even you’re vaccinated, keep wearing masks cause another variant could emerge vaccines don’t work against, etc’ I’m starting get annoyed it. think messaging counterproductive I’m fine wear masks everyone get vaccine I’m definitely starting slightly move side aisle. don’t think masks restrictions mandated even past early mid June, always ‘risk’ gotta live lives point 60% vaccinated likely seems like damn good reason get back normal. Taking approved vaccines get jail free card. heard many people think innoculation shielded. Nothing could truth, simply partial protection , unfortunately emboldens unaware take additional risks. missing overlap. Lots people antibodies vaccinated. Maybe people suck risk assessment arguments used vaccines suffer that. AstroZeneca US yet, was, think would hold Pfizer Moderna personally. That's probably selfish move, go best possibility? Dueling articles... way less fun dueling banjos. tWo WeEks flATten cUrVe 🤥 Dammit. Take upvote. funny. Locking kids multiple years crucial developmental periods child cruelty. Germans - mean fact least 16 different states love therefore discuss opinion shared least twice. problem government one central government another 16 federal state governments little kings queens want make sure look great ...

Discussions means hear pros cons makes people sooner later angry. 

Imagine 16 friends want discuss movie watch. five hours probably decision it’s time go home ... CDC recommends wait 14 days final dose, sure. otherwise, yes. Second Pfizer shot done! feel kinda high...not sure it’s shot relief getting vaccinated lol Lapeer Monroe counties filled open slots. I’d consider SE Michigan. got doses Moderna, along wife, got side effects sore deltoid. 

I hope worked... Oh man I'm American living Germany, yes vaccination rates going slow, still grateful US majority pandemic. bright side germany's vaccination campaign speeding up! Like last week vaccinating 300,000 people day. week jumped 600,000. even though going slow I'm finally optimistic improve numbers things start looking up! hang stay safe. imagine virus came Trump's early term deal fucking longer year? 

Thank fuck happened towards end term I’ll wait years admin NIH officials speak trumps true role pass judgement. Going prior examples wouldn’t surprised learn efforts minimal. I’m FL - little hope humanity here.  didn’t feel compelled eat. hydrated lot more. One factor distribution fast receiving site got shots arms. Native Americans extremely efficient, allotted shipment doubled.  1 10,000 infected surfaces? would rare even 5 random surfaces per day. would one even measure laboratory ""1 10,000 random surfaces""? Generally means checking residence, would assume care live. Appetite? got 2nd feel hunger bad. saved 10,000 deaths. I'm sure medics trained use it, there's Fast1 goes directly sternum. quick delivery, really  6 feet magic number. sharing living space breathing air extended time, exposed. Masks help lot (but wearing -- mask helps does!). keep windows open fans blowing pull fresh air, lot safer (if freeze death).  American really don’t know referred here. 😶 could false positive, possible. could also covid minor case. 

The vaccines 100% effective. Thank links info, perspective! glad things vastly improving seems continue so. California chosen June 15 official date move forward opening, provided catastrophe strikes. expect public schools open fully in-person learning September. hope adults vaccinated May 31 vaccine available distributed 12-15 year olds Aug 31.  

At points, chose vaccinate, state cannot save them. move on. outside result fine. Glad getting good time. now? percentage still wear masks? everything open again? concern allowing visitors? investigating cases clots J&amp;J vaccine well. mean sure?🤷 point time, think U.S. cares country itself, that's first mistake thing covid cases kids showing symptoms possibly asymptomatic they're testing sell immunity they've already built antibodies even they're infected covid matter. got start protecting kids man like they're future world like like vulnerable people society elderly children got start taking better care know who's say they're going long-term effects infected kid covid-19 although asymptomatic suffer symptoms might respiratory problems rest life like know think chance do. Whether side humanitarian reasons hurting kids side economical reasons putting huge burden healthcare system long-term care long covid child adulthood like sides valid reasons terrible idea. big factor us Texas simply warm winter, feel need socialize others, we're willing congregate outside. course, one week February exception, naturally enforced lockdown, helped well.

I'm concerned approach Summer, indoor season. south pretty bad spike last July. Hopefully vaccinations widespread enough issue. balance power keeps changing democrats suck worse republicans people forget vote democrats back in.  That's crazy. CA lowest positivity rate allowing outdoors sports now, masks actively playing. Lots dumb adults taking advantage (coaches parents unmasked). frustrating. Manchin reason Dems majority, he’s holding seat Dems honestly shouldn’t one reddest states country. want blame Dems, blame Gideon Cunningham unable win competitive races. Looking like 1 million least according data notice. 4 cases 4 million administered. pretty much everyone else Southeast Asia.

And part, Japan Korea.

Vietnam's viral song washing hands got people board actually trying, country's aggressive contract tracing quarantines exposed people *worked*. cares? Nobody wants anymore anyway. Maybe Democrats stopped forcing things like gun control focused instead things like healthcare minimum wage would better midterms.  showed remorse victim, hence jail time imho.  No, walk comment back 100 percent truth Apparently fox news needs get memo UK EU anymore... Apparently can't read article I'm EU 😬. actually case last year. believe woman died organ donor lungs transplanted someone else. Unbeknownst them, woman contracted Covid death recipient lungs given Covid. remember right, recipient make it. that, fucking moron like Trump winning handily despite receiving three million fewer votes ""speak power system""? *Cries Canada* said going get ever, currently got it. husband got last weekend totally wiped tree days. three days said felt amazing. Better before!

I got mine hour ago. Fingers crossed bad side effects. god damn thing hurt. Idk man. depends schools area requiring students get multiple weekly tests negative tests players go against. done relatively low risk unless get heat stable

The CureVac mRNA vaccine kept normal fridge temperature. Let's see trials first. see effective are. adenovirus mRNA tech allowing selective design. inactivated virus blender spray pray approach.

It also takes time get platform ready, whereas think either BioNTech Moderna candidate 6 weeks receiving sequenced genome. 

The rest clinical trials simultaneously scale work.

The exciting thing is, mRNA platform considered safe egg base, able roll new flu vax variants quickly. expect governments fund building mRNA facilities standby near future. mean come surprise anyone look every virus bacteria infection kids usually main spreaders viruses. Splitting hairs, is. POG, ""haha america #1 covid cases"" redditors now. one??? evidence US domestic policy hindered European rollout? 

My understanding date, vast majority Pfizer vaccines begun raw materials produced US factories distributed worldwide processing; anything, resources US invested likely *helping* Pfizer production worldwide.

Of course, local production capacity always good thing, it’s great everyone Europe builds factories! don’t see reason requires dissolving successful transatlantic partnership. govt reflection people democracy.

Hard agree goalposting work vaccine. guessing insist dining playing sports aren’t getting vaccinated anyway.

Eh? Dining playing sports means anti-vaxx now? Huh. Note I’m talking myself, perception surrounding this. I’m advocating maximum vaccination. i’m thank you! too, 10 hours. it’s morning next day it’s slight bit better also felt horrible! don’t know could’ve handled actual covid well either haha 3/4+1/4=1, though. 1/4 construction workers vaccinated fully, industry par national average. we'll take canada CureVac fridge storable mRNA vaccine that's ongoing phase 3 trials. would surprised method one end using vaccines future.


Furthermore, understand mRNA vaccines also fundamentally easier manufacture old style vaccines. benefit already established manufacturing capacity like traditional vaccines are. news Pfizer? I'm sorry characters trailer park boys something I'm loop??  CDC states someone fully vaccinated two weeks FIRST shot.

So what’s really meant article? CureVac pioneers technology Drew Weissman Katalin Kariko University Pennsylvania, among others. Pfizer ""help process"", funded 100% it.

It taken many scientists different countries develop mRNA technology. thousands patented inventions field last 20 years.

The Curevac founder first demonstrated effect mRNA vaccines experiment 1999. results published doctoral thesis 2000 patent granted priority date 1999. first document published Kariko Weissman patent dated 6 years later. 

Anyways, UPenn defunded Kariko's research, Biontech Curevac working ever since. 

Pfizer fund vaccine 100%. Aside resources, Biontech received funding German government, EU, Fosun Pfizer.  give countries point entire West failed containing thing, financial crisis? Australia New Zealand anything financial crisis?

Basically, countries well following: 1) shut borders, 2) military-style lockdown, 3) strict respected contact tracing. 

Australia NZ fortunate islands, also deserve credit “western” beat thing. western countries would done type full measures beat thing, half measures didn’t much. Remember - Germany’s “success” numbers significantly closer US’ failure NZ’s success. 12 year old wrestler, he's mats since last March. wrestling group however practicing going state tournaments. precautions tournaments include one parent allowed mask wearing indoors largely ignored. Wrestlers need mask mat coaches side pulling yell (based shared pictures/videos local group). local group one coach owns gym wear mask inside kick out. damn stupid physically hurts think about. Yo dawg. heard like herd immunity immuned herd herd immune herd immunity.  Okay food like avian bird flu spread spread migration birds wildlife yeah can't shut borders. even late. Like variants variance longer b117 got others like little hybrids butting left right mean. feel like comes battling border could take bad turn turn whole like know stay side infection whole area really resolves nothing creates nationalism divide know two communities trying protect look Northern Ireland right . Yesterday post saying 1 4. make adults something? vaccines though ? went back myself.. cocktail lot used it’s great people back bar top! Godspeed fellow bartender.  thought 1/4, pulling numbers ass? left unused? Noone wants received many? can't install Jacinda Williams president pretend...

It helped MUCH Covid, I'd happily take Williams US President anytime. makes politicians look like cartoon villains comparison. saw well. first dose, consider vaccinated two weeks. thought everyone supposed dead point? EU put language required European shots produced Europe could come America. American thing. accident successful players multi-nationals could develop across continents. state rejected safety protocol proposal, starting April 1st county charge accepting protocols. shown support for, hence event organizers going forth plans.  Oh really look flights Montreal airport Toronto airport coming United States Britain different countries look current flights tell there's people traveling Canada without essential reasons. healthcare workers going back forth across border everyday meanwhile considered essential workers know they're guess like doctor level know people clean rooms stuff still Frontline workers vaccinated well surprised like can't shut border there's whole supply chain would completely disrupted like unsustainable currently Canada grow nothing like stuff exported food majority imported fuel well mean shutting borders going stop virus virus already virus going like oh look borders close guess I'll stay side far know, EU explicitly put language required European shots produced Europe. American thing. accident successful players multi-nationals could develop across two continents. 

Thinking need go protect EU jobs vaccine nationalism insane. Looking forward maskless summer 😎 people get vaccine dog vet recommends it. Go figure. lot people it, ones pretty nasty it.

I read comment Canadian guy yesterday (not here, elsewhere online) saying hopes entire population U.S. gets COVID variant.

Canada almost 40 million people, though, bound idiots. Even limit Canadians named Ford.

(Half family Canadian, I'd totally live could tolerate cold weather.) Walgreens garbage, heard, often cancel second dose chips it’s hard reschedule. What's weekly delivery schedule like? many doses manufacture per week? trying get estimate they'll fully supplied. Feels like it'll early mid May, no? Yep, went 2018. People fooling thinking masks social distancing strictly followed 100k+ people. cost like billion dollars sequence first humane genome. 

Now cost virtually zero comparison.

We see improvements exact formulation, provide supply chain savings. time studies ""what night work"" went safe choice.

The big deployments developing world temperature sensitivity. also one done set ups... Getting remote village hard enough once, let alone twice. also halves rate vaccinate massive countries like india china hybrid states development wealth. far see, definitely know it, there's nothing wrong delaying later date. still plenty people willing take it, society point view, taking later changes nothing actually helps someone vulnerable go first.

But say something changing immunity timeframe: that's way say effective X months watch people get sick X months. thing changed ""it's effective 3 months"" ""it's effective 8 months"" five months passed people still start getting sick again. believe happen years.

And another point concrete data effective vaccine is, concrete data post-infection immunity. less effective mild case, everyone gets vaccine dose. ones mentioned near universal vaccination for. 

So developed vaccine gave everyone world instantaneously?

No. vaccine campaigns \*decades\* long, plenty time mutations areas antivaxers taken hold you’re seeing pop up. sort whole point here. 

No isn't. point variants going pop up, become virulent, potentially render vaccine immune. point means it’s still going fester give rise variants. variants survive virulent. may even evade vaccine target. 

So saying point universal vaccination, covid still around textbook goalpost moving. suffered fairly comparable damage Nordics.   Yeah thing okay even exposed somebody head covid-19 live New York husband lives sleeps bed quarantine 2 weeks exposed someone however husband go everyday mingling live days usual realize spoke girl video game informed rule New York like way looked New York website I'll damned. think they're like vaccinating like 4 million people day something like astronomical number. definitely putting dent numbers decreasing virus spread. 3,403,060...and :) Medium medium well still make pretty lame steak, like wearing masks forever would pretty lame life. article yesterday, today's numbers  vaccination site got shot set public park small town TN. sitting car, waiting 15 minutes, two teen baseball teams practicing. kids goofing off, shoving around, high-fiving, totally maskless course. juxtaposition poignant. I, one shocked. Wait powerful politician follow rules everyone else?

Since ~~when~~ where? Oh, okay. Norway. point optics ""not giving away American vaccines."" Pretty disappointing Biden.

Seriously, loan them, sell profit, whatever. get countries need them. Better yet, stop stockpiling let AstraZeneca sell countries fill existing orders already paid for!  Absolutely. Merkel right thing time transferred procurement EU. can't even imagine would happened Germany, richest country, outbid EU states now, example, half vaccinated - small poor countries would still received vaccine all. would 100% end EU.  remember line frkm show Boondocks ""But we're Americans. quit we're wrong. keep wrong thing turns right.""  How's Brexit working UK? think done relatively low risk, particularly outdoor youth sports. youth sports seen pretty good protocols place practices games. lot spread associated events tends related teams going dinner events team gatherings peoples home. parents sport itself.  got mine today local volunteer fire department. made appointment online got shot car. Took 15 minutes. queue parallel line three cars advanced queue every 5 minutes. gave 15 minute review time people walking lines check OK.

No cost all. shot free VFD administered shot free. J&amp;J, one done. CDC card. explain disparity countries? 

cases, deaths covid19 countries mentioned: 

* Australia - 29.4k cases, 909 deaths
* Singapore - 60.6k cases, 30 deaths 
* China (origin virus) - 90.4k cases, 4.6k deaths 
* Vietnam - 2.7k cases, 35 deaths 


meanwhile cases, deaths covid19 politically declining countries:

* United States - 31,764k cases, 574.3k deaths
* United Kingdom - 4,365.5k cases, 127k deaths
* ... even gonna keep listing European countries think get point.

So thing matters incubation period, saying happens countries gridlocked, paralyzed governments somehow got version virus longer incubation period? like there's many variables take account like yeah numbers could look really bad hand variant could eventually become less virulent make people sick anymore could die go complete opposite worst case scenario. mean thing nobody know virus came know that's little bit stupid say loud like genetically sequence woolly mammoth figure way Jurassic Park asses back life? maybe get guys woolly mammoths genetics team like take look covid-19 figure little bit date currently showing ... Pro tips always comments also possible people took social distancing seriously hospitalizations higher. hospitalizations started dropping vulnerable got vaccines people likely felt need remain home stay apart leads people going continuing spread it. Yes, biggest mistake I've made first years working Germany giving pessimistic first estimates everything. 

I gave realistic slightly optimistic dates/numbers without meaning to... Mostly new job thought could really make dates/ numbers I'd said. Anyway blowback crazy here... I'm providing ranges hoping works bit better. someone Michigan feel this. Got first shot couple days ago super stoked hard feel excited cases rising every day. want us hit peak already turn final corner thing. [17% [20% conscientious masking probably going lower (and wearing mask probably would even more), AFAIK can't say much.  I'll treat anything speculation source provided, nothing personal.

Whilst sample size small study, bmj consider reliable data, agree signs look good. Results currently unknown pfizer wrt variants particularly relevant. short term (months) risk death get AZ vaccine do, unless alternative readily available putting risk. true age groups (including you) unless covid prevalence even UK currently - unless AUS/NZ actively putting risk death reason, pretty idiotic ask me. next months herd immunity isnt really relevant, people dying everything go back normal. 

You always get alternative vaccine later necessary, holding one advising people actively putting greater risk. see effect Europe, people turning AZ vaccine people dying unnecessarily result. Relatively dependent imports India. mean 5m, realise many vaccinations carried far? 


We'd behind are, dependent them. recieving since time, able make use them. Looking forward seeing vaccine passport theater replace hygiene theater /s. they're similarly-placed line, negligible benefit im sentiments, sovereign state? CCP isnt terrorist organization, *is* China. True although poorer Indians likely ones booking flights New Zealand right now. Similar symptoms first shot. bit tightness muscles. Within 24 hours feeling almost normal. 

I negative reaction second shot. bit surprised. fever, fatigue almost two weeks seem problem companies pushing product uncontested quality time. take vaccine even producing company trust in. one places experimenting third dose? pretend cat opinion sputnik V? wouldn’t surprised Bezos took opportunity eliminate Whole Foods efficiency improvement. removed completely local one. justification whatsoever. it’s safe loose potatoes it’s safe loose rice beans. outdoor basketball hoops still boarded gyms open. hate shallow cowardly hypocrites inhabit world. also hard say pandemic would looked like people charge genuinely cared saving lives saving careers. mean experts saying way Trump handled crisis responsible first 100,000 deaths.

Trump cronies (DeSantis particular) acted like work Covid 19. Consistent bad public health advice fear alienating constituents pretty transparently craven. fanning flames. paste URL private window worst sooner later lot people. Goodspeed, drink lot fluids! I'm hoping 2nd Moderna. made sure enough sleep well-hydrated first dose. already take Vitamin diagnosed deficiency, I'm hoping mitigates knock-out reactions Moderna 2nd dose. counting vaccines produced Belgium Germany exported EU countries ""exported?""

No, don't. know latest figures, couple weeks ago, EU announced allowed exports 77 million doses. time India exported 60 million doses. meantime, India stopped exporting, think China Russia exported that, even though said Russian vaccine also produced outside Russia. signed vaccine long time ago... old list still valid? talk Hausarzt getting appointment her? Haha true everyone wants get vaccinated need open things. sense punishing people right thing protect people don’t protect themselves. Definitely case Idaho, state even ever mask mandate, state house passed legislation barring local governments enforcing them, live one probably dozen cities state actually mansate I'm happy people can't find way get due transportation disparities. Take mask hit bar, brother CureVac took different approach vaccine. care much speed (there already candidates that, like BioNTech), aiming vaccine much polished.

As such, spent time tweaking vaccine. example, vaccine less half dosage compared Pfizer (and eight times less Moderna). also stand normal fridge temperatures 3 months, really help distribution poorer countries.

Still, results supposed come way sooner, like around February/March. yet April Ask around see anyone wants go :)  Honestly think parties gatherings whether 1 case 10k cases story here. Minor soreness #1, almost nothing #2. Easy peasy. Go get it, people! wasn’t outcry way Warpspeed announced? think two different things.  Canada also like 1/10 population US similar land mass US. Population matters. population *density*, odd reason nobody ever talks about. surface, would agree this. However, lot *why* low demand logistical nightmare rural impoverished state. People seem confuse lot. ""We sufficient evidence know X true"" imply ""we think X probably false"". There's reason assume vaccine prevent infection, studied directly, there's hard evidence claim does, science err side caution rather make premature assumptions. didn’t label enemy? Got mine wednesday, yesterday tender. Barely feel today :) Actually makes see many improvements dire need making best advocate changes 95% rest world would consider brainer decisions America called ""politics"".

I'd rather fight better life moreso fellow citizens even saw aw shucks nothing. Love moved goal post include Baltic/Nordic countries main arguement Sweden Finland. agree, facilities able handle walk-ins logistical perspective. also end extra doses Moderna Pfizer, could lead waste. Damn similar experience quite severe. Still feeling well 24 hrs later. Canada population US would ~230,000 deaths least. Better, nothing write home brag reddit. data (per capita) accurate data collection methods. lead discrepancies less populated nations, obvious differences reliability data.

Additionally factors, described before, skew data usefulness.

You (true) could multiply population even population generate death count based per capita rate extrapolating even great solution either. Hey same, going back tomorrow.

Saw guy ""White Pride"" tattoo maybe 50% masks! Nobody ever stays hospitals Canada? Getting shot FL tomorrow 10 am.

Enjoy day. Ironically, Warp Speed actually trying CureVac - give similar contract Moderna Pfizer received, politicians Berlin freaked out, claimed USA trying buy company (which denied everyone involved). Oxford wanted pair Merck, UK government shot down, Astra Zeneca screwing one every day since. 

&amp;#x200B;

It;s mistake successful entities ones good cross continent connections development cycles. US making excellent progress right now, unfortunately we're almost certainly going stall 60-70% country vaccinated. Thanks Trump downplaying pandemic making taking seriously political wedge issue solid 30-40% country refusing get vaccinated ideological stance. several degrees bad, certainly doubt would've gone 'half million deaths' bad Trump president. Manchin guaranteeing it.  friend mom 14 hour nap lol averse that. Thanks! get talking about, that's case. I'm someone given completely humanity. Remember: March last year four months virus began circulate. plenty could done prevent this. ultimate, hidden truth world something make, could easily make differently. - David Graeber  Pfiezer 2 wednesday - fatigue yesterday fine otherwise! would multiply it? sucks got pfizer months ago aunt ""prayed wouldnt die it"" definately scared mom ive understanding talked lot going get first shot today long go one took people scared influenced crazies.  Pneumonia vaccine MUCH worse arm-soreness wise Pfizer. Given Pfizer's reputation medications, expected much injection site...stiffness. mRNA requires expensive tech produce. world would able afford therefore depend handouts rich countries. already seen rich countries like seal supply chains hoard vaccine supplies instead sharing equitably.

It better everyone especially global poor decentralize democratize vaccine production. point COVID presents zero risk children simply accurate. know long-term effects years. Uhm...what? experiment continues time being. risk people countries predominant variants first identified countries. Kids aren’t really risk think vaccine go full regulatory compliance administered kids.  Nothing nationalism. Pfizer relying US production capacity massive hindrance rollout Europe. would like avoid situations like future. breakup already happening BioNTech ramping production partnering European Pharma companies. sure bout that?

Where link state government forced J&amp;J use Emergent BioSolutions? Yeah - Michigan 7x cases per 100k people Texas right now. Check stickied comment yesterdays. Vaccination posts allowed matter president characteristics changing.

The situation would extent matter president, however, Trump likely NPD arrogance worst scenario.

I’m liberal conservative think there’s case made Trump’s actions lack thereof personally responsible large chunk deaths. Yep, even dumb model shown already validated least somewhat.

You data date Y. build model date 0 date X, X &lt; Y. show model seen dates X+1 predict happened dates. can, probably confidence model.

Very basic stuff. need wait period trying predict see model still works. (Obviously, something changes dates 0 X longer fundamentally date Y+1, model able predict Y+1 anymore.) ~80%. greatly state state. Polling Mass example 90% adults want vaccine, aren’t replicating numbers nation wide. supposed mega thread dont see todays I’m vague situation vague, I’m policy maker, different states counties see different results. 

I feel it’s hard grasp understanding currently, things normal. Clubs, bars, concert venues, theme parks, etc large restrictions them. point being: cases hit sharp decline level herd immunity, impossible charge continue upholding restrictions. 

Shut catch term figured people understand sentiment. Damn. Solid work. MI highschools already quarantined week spring break said quarantine additional 2 weeks. said quarantine needed classes grades entire buildings. giving families option quarantine want.  I've read vaccines good 6 months. mean need get vaccinated every 6 months? Non-paywall link:  Considering badly botched rest pandemic, needed least get part right.

Also shows though desperate majority get back full scale restaurants bars open. horrible response night felt horribly sick. next afternoon (about 30 hours shot) felt totally normal long took Tylenol. randomly 3 days shot arm started hurting apparently common. 10 days shot I’m feeling fine :) Thanks detailed reply! 

I know eventually I’m going get it, don’t know should. It’s question never getting it, when. feel like reasonable question people recovered, much concrete detail prior infection vaccine. immunity, one day 3 months next it’s 8. want concrete data show way, yet doesn’t seem like much. would want extremely sick I’ve already it, protection average person, less chance average person contract spread Israel also advantage New Jersey. 

(I kid, kid.) heard JnJ vaccine start show blood clot issues too. related technology vaccine? think Astra JnJ use technology, right? Meh, fuck em. We’re gonna get point anyone get day-of vaccine free wait times. Six weeks shouldn’t cater anti-vaxers get back regular life. get sick, well, play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I’ll getting first dose Pfizer Tuesday! can’t wait! ignorant the...ignorant? Oh, come Bay Area sub-- lots folks ready stay home forever. Nice! Got JnJ 48 hours ago. First night slept alot felt achy gone next morning. feeling totally fine Nice! area don’t seem Pfizer Moderna JnJ. Speaking American, definitely see way. Americans sometimes dicks internet, Canadians sometimes dicks internet. That's Reddit. 

Any decent American concerned friends north eager send excess vaccines way time comes. discounting global weight china russia throwing behind vaccines goes show incompetent Trump was. Biden taking literally like flicking switch. Trump sycophants fucking clue mobilize resources organize response, quickly pivoted downplaying pandemic instead save face. close 100 percent severe illness.  shown greatly reduce transmission reason longer important.  

I disagree 20 1 reduction chance getting already fairly low.  Pfizer clinical trial, 21000 vaccinated people, 8 cases reported.  I'll take odds. seen little-to-none reddit. *have* seen lot people expressing need caution return normal life, gets mistaken readiness ""hole forever."" \-Michael Scott think many people strangely relying government

It's strange consider, Dec./Jan/Feb, county &amp; city health agencies getting lion's share vaccine allocations. (At least Texas, I've gathered numerous states thing)

It starting March private providers (CVS, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, regional groceries like HEB, etc) started receiving allocation significant numbers. people maybe heard &amp; may think ""govt agencies still ones it"" Yeah, arbitrary random, like said. easy remember.

Plus, mostly normal July, really feel July 4th gatherings parties happening. Good news. Vaccines work export restrictions too! Germany stonks, Germany bestest much hate what's happening Canada - almost feel like karma cruel saw fellow Canadians Americans months ago.

I've never ashamed country's leadership. end something kills 1 4 kids.

COVID never deadly segment population. wtf. Sure, COVID, nastiness get unclean surfaces? Tetanus, MRSA, etc. stakes flu though. Kids die flu every year. odds same, talking about? Watch UK cases drop near zero july 1st EU immigrants longer request settled status UK. already annouced full opening july 1st individual states must comply with

It’s even simpler, since entire Cruise industry foreign owned (for tax dodging purposes). It’s even state issue, since company ships aren’t based Florida all.

Purely international maritime issue, entirely federal jurisdiction. [Today's Vaccine Tracker Appointment Wow. thought Florida game ... shocking thing read AMA today. think Except J&amp;S one shot vaccine, others fully effective second dose. much first dose depends vaccine. data perusal, look journals (we linked TWiV episodes). would say 4 weeks second dose start relax, especially vaccinated individuals.

Don’t relax mRNA vaccine 4 weeks second dose? Unless J&amp;J, you’re good?

What?

Doesn’t kind contradict stuff we’re hearing mRNA vaccines extremely effective first dose?

4 *weeks* 2nd dose? Yikes. 50 year old young adult? Thanks doctor, currently practice medicine? fact everyone listing anecdotal data thread nuts lol. article says 10% people getting vaccine actually V-SAFE (wtf) data really diverge lot read online. minority people either vaccine's second dose got fever kind. read reddit threads, think number 80%+.

Here's actual v-safe data (sorry url gore): Well, today maybe, look far graph goes. got notified appointment could pick hundreds 15 minute spots period 5-7 days. would keep trying. Yeah, same.

I caught nasty respiratory bug January. worst coughing I've entire life, exhaustion, fever, etc., etc. coughing/sick entire month.

Michigan literally almost island Great anecdote, back data. greater numbers left-leaning folks, claiming want vaccination. Even though majority (\~40%), still far greater self-identified Democrats refusing vaccination (4%). gulf refusals based politics alone quite remarkable. 

It's great family accepted vaccine though – thanks what's best everyone. Doesn’t J+J use stabilized one like Pfizer Moderna?

It’s risk assessment. certain level risk death society accept. 38,000 people die car accidents every single year US. could save many lives outlawing inessential trips car. don’t freedoms enjoy able drive whenever want worth risk death.

95,000 Americans die alcohol related deaths every year US. could save many lives bringing back prohibition, don’t, freedoms enjoy able consume beer, wine, liquor worth risk death.

Do see I’m going this? make cost-benefit trade offs every single day. another one. Goes hive mind sub agenda. downvoted doesn’t match agenda. order made. simply asking nicely. I'm French, living France people know want anything vaccine yeah... good luck know, totally agree, reason stated. “Healthcare worker” pretty vague, [the CDC says US 18 million 

Given US population 330M, means ~1/18 people work healthcare. Given 570k deaths US far, would therefore expect 32k healthcare deaths exactly proportionate. article suggests almost 10x less.

I understand many deaths skewed older, likely retired, even then, agree - would expect deaths HIGHER proportionate (as “frontline” worker there) yet they’re **significantly** LOWER proportionate. Trump, Biden, simply willing spend Merkel was. Yes know comparison quite work truth EU aggregate people larger economy United States.

No didn't. CDC never told people stop using alcohol-based sanitizers. Google searching ""hand sanitizer kills protective bacteria"" brings bunch New Agey crap ""alternative"" health sources. Cash Vax also great slogan.

In 08 financial crisis ‘cash clunkers’ great stimulus package saved car industry, reduced emissions improved safety. 

The name also dope Well that’s specific symptom.😆 whole pandemic threw importance correct truthfully messages. Experts keep changing minds every day based data see concrete. Mixed messaging what’s happening here. I’m sure already seen this, Whitmer asks 2-week pause Michigan youth sports, indoor dining, in-person learning makes feel better, changed email every 2 years think keep getting hacked. facebook account gets hacked? change email. Get weird email? change email. bailed Google Android still OG account like 2004 According government figures ICU admissions past 7 days, 60 constitute 1153 cases total 2947, almost 40%. significant number elderly presumably vaccinated patients ICU, can't discount that. Significantly less OP trying believe. Ontario vaccinating 100k+ every day Canada receiving 1 million+ doses weekly. parts country already reached 20% people least one dose. We're largely keeping pace EU, comparing US pretty pointless since basically unlimited supply doses. news... 1 4 Americans refuse vaccinate. We're shit hole yet.

If hospitals workers tell anti-vaxxers go home pray. immune system fine. 

Glad got 5G system now. signal strong. almost like dumb people dumb. Look political map region find red leaning counties. Michigan anything like Washington availability there. bit drive. partner fainted first Pfizer shot. faints thinking blood. EMTs gave good advice second shot went without hitch! talking about? “lockdowns” (which really mild restrictions compared countries actually stopped spread using suppressive measures) ground cases halt Michigan. started surging Whitmer ousted former Michigan state health director replaced Republican could reopen schools indoor dining. Cases exploded. That's it; president *have* ""best"" person job, long they're willing surround people *are* best (shit, we'll settle competent!) respective jobs. love Biden pulled candidates fold (obvs Harris, Buttigieg, willingness work Warren Sanders.) really makes difference narcissistic conman helm.

Businesses haven’t able want past year paraphrase Homer Simpson...""all variants far!"".

Every infection opportunity mutation variant. Every variant *could* find way evade vaccinated (and previously infected) immunity. Scientists generally agree unlikely, impossible - giving virus extra billion attempts good idea.

For someone relatively young healthy, happy 2 dosages (asked unblinded) part Ensemble 2 study. Give sec - somebody posted here.

See slides 48 49: Africa.  Sputnik V approved WHO? vaccines approved actually means something countries rely use it? gamblers fallacy odds changing.

If want use logic, considering effectiveness vaccine, point better getting vaccine covers 95%. can! Like said, one person, sentiment end point zero cases.

As “risk” 5% even get exposed ultimately get isn’t given, decision. Like said, vaccine ubiquitously available sense get easily everyone wants it, become personal decision sort thing. Israel UK saw strong downward trends vaccination percentages hit 40-50% given first dose. US 33.5%. see case numbers begin permanently decline towards end month.

It requires number experts achieve this. Trump boss time zero symptoms first dose. Haven’t gotten second yet though pleasure! It’s rare Pfizer vaccine, got (lucky me?). mildly annoying, big deal whatsoever- didn’t even feel like needed topical antihistamine, resolved within 5 days, point looked like faded bruise. Go cvs website try searching area code. Companies freely export vaccines already bought.

Same UK.

Same EU, far goes.

Again, though, fact phrased question way shows *know*
there's export ban. cases started skyrocket MN, gov shut everything &amp; saw cases sharply decline. 

Opened back &amp; back way up. Certainly Pfizer developed vacancie without government assistance. first get approval.

Operation Warp Speed seemed help others I'm unsure extent did.

The distribution January total cluster. Pfizer doses given instructions send too. definitely doesnt need hospital, got mine safeway food court, people currently eating Yeah frontlines playskool chemistry set Yes, fight bad info side step it? see well went US tried fight misinformation around election fraud. maximizing vaccination velocity “what’s right”.  What’s right slows vaccination there’s nothing it. Lol. thing vaccine. ok 👌 level, they're transparent, good thing. words get twisted assigned new meaning idiots can't think critically perpetuate twisted version said becomes disinformation problem.

Same thing ""it's good 6 months"" BS group people spews. +3.96M according Cyrus Shahpar versus +3.975M last Friday.

7 day average virtually unchanged 3.03M. probable need vaccinate kids achieve herd immunity.

Aside that, study widely ignored discredited UK. cheap headline nobody takes serious, even author study stressing number caveats needed make claim. name short “weapons grade stupidity?” good evidence never heavily skewed towards "" still get infected"" 95% effective vaccine everyone expected high level sterilizing immunity. several studies show true. could create huge list items 'aren't necessary survival' still sale. banned from, example, contactless pickup items. would argue basic home maintenance tasks sorts things want allowed lockdown people 'forced' way longer usually are. let's say computer desk broken cared use whole bunch. Suddenly I'm working home need new desk. bad, apparently.

And lot arbitrary restrictions make whole lot sense either. could go kayaking take boat lake fill boat gas, even though act filling boat gas contactless.

When presented problems inconsistencies governor's office bristled making changes even clarifying confusing rules. Hopefully understand going hard time instituting new rules again. wife get JnJ shot tomorrow Cal State LA. Vaccines also make less likely you’d catch virus. 

Good masks nearly 100% effective, though. It’s wear procedure cloth masks reason nowhere near 100% effectiveness. point large, resistant, minority simply never get vax, ever 

All initial numbers people actively sought vax. vax rate likely fall enthusiastic vaxer vaxed, leaving resisters. 

The question becomes, able vax enough people gain herd immunity not? still open ended question. recent poll showed ""49% male ________s get vaccinated"", blank spot due sub rules find easily. lot people right dude. teaching online across range constituencies compared teaching person limited range indicates difference instructor. teachers need better preparation, need work harder instead complaining. difficult.  Thankfully case numbers matter soon! masks time. 
Are PCR tests effective first couple days contact? list map 😂😂. Slovakia listed. Sputnik V approved emergency use 60 countries (correction). Germany Austria buying it. Many EU countries well. Deal it.

Last night still fever 100 nausea chills gone. morning feeling 95% normal thankfully temperature finally back normal. tired, think mainly lack proper sleep rather fatigue vaccine itself.  


I honestly thought side effects heard overblown, night 2nd vaccine kicked butt reality. father also 2nd Moderna shot, almost side effects, find kind odd. That's great hear friend statistics show definitely problem addressed NHS, particularly trust. Anybody got data much J&amp;J US actually administering compared two?

Nope matter. J&amp;J reports surfacing today. Within week two, J&amp;J bad optics problem.

So what? Continue pander public scientific ignorance, make actual attempt educating? Smack dealers  Nah. We'll suck bad next pandemic. give us logistical problem make rich people money? We're shit FDA sure did. think count experts. Fortunately looks like offending “antibacterial” ingredients back Feels like they're going talking variants individual city blocks over. huge considering time periodi normal. hand still great new. wearing masks entire time? hurt get PCR - rapid tests effective individuals without symptoms. 2.05% world population completely vaccinated. 5.34% taken 1 dose yet. 90%-95% effective mean 5%-10% chance catching virus. means chances reduced 95% point time. chances never 100% anytime. reality vaccine makes chances many many times smaller 5% catching it. Like .01% general something stupid low. +3.96m doses administered via Cyrus Shahpar. doubt apathy thing case. Pretty much everybody Mississippi either white conservative Black. two groups distrustful vaccines. 1/3 windows would open doors opening outside. Ask thousand people choose J&amp;J AstraZeneca, guarantee people avoid AstraZeneca. You’re trying fight bad optics boring numbers. You’re using wrong tool.  mean despise Trump, gets little credit vaccine development, no? Someone jailed that... unfortunate. Would bad leg workout right got 2nd dose? Idk say mean ""when restrictions over"". I'm young, I'm scared virus soon parents get vaccinated virus even top 100 things I'm scared of. Social distance entire year like top 3 biggest fears. I'm tired scary clickbait-y articles, making big fuss every single COVID genome change, etc Masks &amp; social distancing make *less likely* *catch* virus.

They nowhere near 100% effective, offer 0% protection catch it. US daily death rates country look like they’re headed hundreds, good, cases per day still high. US ban.

Yea, Bill Gates infamous using global charitable initiatives front things like enforcing IP patent regimes developing countries protect interests first world elites. I’d take whatever says kind thing huge grain USA good this! #GCOE!! Man, happened PA doses? sounds like Republican anti vaccine advertisement- severity denial etc.... That's nice kids nannied mild. base "" covid big deal"" attitude alone oversimplifies things. vaccinate them? 250 kids freakin died due covid. aso help spread it. Covid many known unknown long term effects .... point vaccines. parents said won’t get isn’t fully FDA approved, Emergency Use Approved. Said really safe, hasn’t FDA approved yet.. WTF people shitting people's vaccines? got J&amp;J. Ever since got co-worker shit constantly got Moderna.  Every single day brings J&amp;J less effective barely effective flu shot Moderna better, etc, etc, etc...... I've ignoring starting get nerves. fuck cares vaccine someone got long get one? J&amp;J good Moderna Pfizer anything else everything I've read. say sucks worldwide numbers Impfdashboard.de german, official website. Also source image post. Google translate probably work enough understand looking at. reach herd immunity virus die introduced infection able sustain transmission. don’t need everyone vaccinated reach goal.

We may still localized outbreaks especially dense urban areas won’t require level intervention today.

Things going look different three months now. I'm getting $75 getting vaccine. realize flu vaccines thing new one developed every year. 

You know, time time frame COVID vaccine. story fits someones agenda/narrative. Yes, still spread virus. Nah, fully vaccinated whatever allowed. US pretty much everything. Makes sense country overweight people would vaccinate virus kills mostly overweight people NYC. That’s family got vaccinated. district, in-person since last semester, actually hurting they're planning cut positions sites.  anybody know site shows daily vaccinations Germany? one find updated since middle March. matter twist numbers mRNAs superior J&amp;J. 70% protection symptomatic vs 95% protection symptomatic. huge difference. One reasons AZ used much stored fridge rather specialized freezer needed RNA vaccines. lot easier set centers vaccination way AZ, J&amp;J,.... kind hard argue e.g. people dying thrombosis induced AstraZeneca small sacrifice stop pandemic better alternatives available  mean I’m using family example. There’s enough examples they’re writing articles now. NYC many Asian parents would fanatical education perfect attendance special gifted programs realize every child comes privileged home, right? Lack computer access, quiet place study, reliable internet access, parent availability assist, even food certain situations (some poor kids get meals school). think getting left behind - wealthy, hire nanny tutor parent stay home send kids person private school? children people dire financial circumstances, maybe two parents working home, worse - poor homeless. Who's going worse outcome years can't make missed? 

Check privilege door stop telling people disaster. MANY doctors agree is. Democracy Dies behind Paywalls. asshat

lol guy really 14 years old Re-openings...

It seems states extremely hard closings experiencing biggest surges/waves “suddenly” opening up. 

Most States never slammed door shut surging. 

Probably combination exposure &amp; vaccine getting closer herd immunity faster. Lol, bro, generational issue. killing people issue. Sorry meant percentage vaccinated drop happened How, without vaccinating children? challenging assertion looking explanation. got 1st shot Tuesday morning. side effects except sore arm Wednesday gone. Today I'm feeling extremely tired despite getting good sleep. odds related Moderna vaccine? Incorrect. US [is also seeing big J&amp;J delivery. don’t complain much ever rising property tax. 😜 NZ fuck covid 19? 

I’d proud country handled well politicized basic prevention prominent politicians calling fraud. I'm happy say used hand sanitizer twice last year. stuff horrible hands Kids least affected Covid. would vaccinate them? Many adults don’t believe fear porn advertising blitz getting vaccine. would healthy individual take risk emergency authorization vaccine clinical studies done. mean gotta take care country first Read today UK sent AZ doses Australia European export Oz blocked. got Moderna vaccine. headache little body ache times. went away next day. much problem colleges mandating vaccines. problem still requiring masks/distancing despite that. America finally getting america’d. Lol you’re getting downvoted dooming. Eh, could typo thinking Pfizer trial phrasing ""four weeks first dose"" meaning week second dose. I’m thinking Canada went heavy reactive rather proactive. I.e. lockdowns restrictions rather cranking vacc.

Both Canada EU went ""we believe science!!! let's lockdowns, get us it!!"" Unfortunately variant strains higher chance reinfection. arm lot less sore second dose. half much first. 24hrs post vaccine, ome mild fatigue. get first dose. fatigue lasted three hours. Easy peasy. dont think Australia even managed get 600000 vaccines country. :-( one enforcing anyway. looks like Russia sent mRNA vaccine ""Sputnik"" Lancet EMA, sent Sputnik Slovakia. vaccine sent Lancet stored -18 C (meaning mRNA vaccine) real Sputnik arrived Slovakia temperature constraint. Ooh like this. I'm day 12 Pfizer first dose right now, actually ramping up. Strongly heading towards 50 percent adults one dose go get shot. understand logic reality US imposing actual lockdown difficult especially younger ages (for anyone 40 young :-)). 
Also, course want protect aged population, transmissibility result overall higher mortality population. math using average R0 (R nought) numbers incubation times. E.g. variant high transmissibility lower mortality dangerous high mortality’s degree low transmissibility one. shouldn’t choose gets first. reality different .  Congratulations! got first pfizer today I'm happy! It’s like hand washing messaging beginning. should’ve already happening! seems like, majority people, benefits AZ vax outweigh risks. I’m holding accountable need be. However can’t stomach half stuff r/Canada. Aside sheer partisanship place much misinformation spread around can’t take anyone seriously. great? No. Could government made decisions earlier make things better? course. Yet we’re fine. hope learn this. be, NZ citizens guaranteed entry country bill rights act. suppose could argue disallowing flights India exactly thing still seem like something country ever citizens. quote DeSantis? thinking based anecdotal evidence bc closer circle friends, believes ""preparing"" worst case scenario...its strange assumes worst case scenario symptoms see worst case scenario getting second dose.. every country vaccination programs speed U.S., might shift away U.S.-centric discussion know well immunity hold compared vaccination. recommended reason. starting believe lot side effects mental come people hyper aware body shot anxiety *expected* effects. 

I see one person vaccine clinic say feel dizzy see EMT within 10 minutes 5 people feeling bad. Doses separated dozens vials bad batch. rest day nothing happen, always clusters. started hear people close someone got *really sick* also get really sick even blood relation. 

Only pain felt needle. slightest sorness day blood tests give pain shot tbh. know you, know college kids 16. got J&amp;J well entire body sore achy 36 hours. Felt like got hit truck. Didn’t fever everything else sounds familiar. helps feel better tomorrow. Given percentage chance bad outcome vs taking OTC drugs, I'm really sure. second dose due 52 days. I'm happy take it, odds dying dying struck lightning. honestly believe could kill 1 4 kids? I'm gonna see much trash theaters even care. 2022 theaters best year ever! anyone taken cbd getting theirs? i’m deathly afraid needles i’m pretty sure way i’m gonna able get j&amp;j one take lot go can’t find anything anywhere. still horribly unprofessional irresponsible messaging. can't get enough lather hand soap bathrooms available get enough wash 2 seconds let alone 20. Still waiting covid shot, happen injections occasionally. Probably needle nicked capillary, bit unpleasant looking nothing effects vaccination. That’s welcome improvement 90% “it’s flu time get back normal” crap we’ve getting weeks. majority population yes old fat people Smh 🙏🙏 received J&amp;J Sat around noon. side-effects slightly sore arm nighttime. minor chills throughout night along slight headache next day. needed sleep day Sunday.

Obviously decisions outside motivators speak, ""just science"". don’t think end dates include mask use, though. Ah that’s Lori JB clashing Little hand sanitizer much masks social distancing. Colds flu don’t spread via surfaces, either. Surface spreading mostly bacteria thing. Chicago proper rest Illinois operating independently getting respective supplies, (and can) operate different phases. would thought would essential workers, like athletes. think study LA times article links also analyzed Moderna's effectiveness South African variant. can't confirm though LA times membership can't click links lol.

But blurb NEJM study today's COVID Act study finds COVID antibodies elicited Moderna vaccine two times less able neutralize B.1.429 (SARS-CoV-2 variant first identified California) 9.7 times less able neutralize B.1.351 (variant first identified South Africa). COVID antibodies elicited Novavax vaccine 2.5 times less able neutralize B.1.429 14.5 times less able neutralize B.1.351. Given high levels antibodies generated vaccines, **the researchers speculate able protect B.1.429 B.1.351.**

Link study: bad they're suggesting, got Moderna vaccine :( Drake. American rates going vaccination program. Canadian rates going variants lack vaccine availability launch robust vaccination program. really simple. Yes, 1/2 billion Germans! sheds light came AMA earlier. dad’s one reported getting vaccine improving “long covid” sufferers.

On another note, losing taste/smell 8-10 months absolutely horrible... anyone say “just flu” crap reading this?? think every single new case anti-masker? thousands thousands new cases day. anti-maskers?

It comes somewhere.

People cough hands, touch things nasty filth. I'd rather risk it. US's initial rollout still faster world, especially adjust population size. think mixed 3 decades 3 years. 3 ≠ 30 Smaller office spaces lower rent, lower electricity utilities bills building, higher productivity, fewer workplace injuries, fewer HR incidents like harassment violence, lower maintenance costs, etc., etc., AKA Save shit ton money! Let people work home!

This. many stories thread people's companies going back office industries absolutely way require it. I'm wondering many company leaders apparently need reminded business *make* money... waste completely unneeded overhead. Yeah, trying say risk mitigation still let live lives. teach elementary students seem perfectly happy learn play together masks on! constantly changing recommendations CDC problem. slow change time, that's one thing, Rochelle Walensky others make public statement contradicted 24 hours later helped create problem trust. type person thinking originally idea, mainly similar me. lockdowns could get work 20-25 minutes, people back droves started take nearly 2 hours days. route, job, weather, many people. comparison stupid. taking measures stop spread. Virus still spread rate, nobody would criticising India. 

But nah everything global conspiracy Indians it.

Shot 1: Fatigue, aches, diarrhea. arm fine though little sore. Started 6 hours injection peaked 12 hours that. 24 hours onset fine.

Shot 2: shot 1 plus 103 fever, chills, uncontrollable shivering non stop sweating. started 6 hours injection peaked 20 hours later. worst lasted 30 hours. nausea dizziness another 4 days.

It's true last six months. six months since massive numbers volunteers vaccinated still showing strong immune responses know 6 months *at least* long vaccine lasts. maximum amount. 

To head misconception gets posted rather frequently, there's every reason believe vaccines significantly cut transmission vaccinated person. 

The actual components vaccines get degraded body within period weeks so, left immune response. mechanism worried causing long-term effects also risk naturally contracting covid?

Being young healthy means quite low risk covid vaccination. Human brains badly designed comparing big small numbers really case vaccine poses far less risk covid does, even though risks small terms serious outcomes. got first shot Moderna expected arm pretty sore (started 3+ hours later). wondering okay move around makes pain lower leave still?

A quick Google search... number people willing get vaccinated seems continue increase well. 50s 60s mid 70s. Seems like tone dire here.  Umm... Bimonthly tests would better would less likely catch COVID cases. Better yet would twice week tests. someone wants refuse shot, get life made easier posing risk everyone else.

That's positive step, clear, they're loaned part future delivery, US blocked filled first place. US cause Canadian shortage, partial solution shortage created.

Now loan better loan, exports rather block would even better.

On whole, Canadian vaccination efforts, like Mexican vaccination efforts, primarily driven output factories located EU, kind crazy given geographical proximity. Fuck Donald Trump fat fucking ass. didn’t goddamn thing. there's France. . fair, 5G nanobot tech ready COVIDs. Shut sour mouthed nonce. loved EU wanted stay fucked up. Stop blaming UK vaccine shortages. Blame leaders. like UK government power stop EU whatever wants. Whatever happened governments fault.

One reason negotiations got fraught EU threatening stop export vaccines UK vaccine made precursor parts made UK- thing french, German, British American vaccine anymore, beginning end. different elements biomaterials, IP, multiple countries markets origin. Germany pulled shit wouldn’t able produce vaccine first place. Luckily German government recognises this. That’s actually better thought, number high 50% last year it’s come quite bit. 

At rate, far I’m concerned soon every American adult reasonable chance get shot. Ideally, number willing people high enough get herd immunity that. don’t, then... oh well. can’t live like forever, you’re going change many anti-vaxxers minds. you’ve chance get vaccine declined, longer society’s responsibility protect you. People hear numbers like 60%, 75%, 85%, think measure thing higher number better. simply case.

The numbers reported basically averages many numbers, like effective vaccine 7, 14, 21, 28 days, symptoms, mild/severe illness death. Really reporting like 10 numbers much. average together single number. besides that, numbers statistics trials real world might different.

Truth based data collected, vaccines almost equally effective severe illness death, including variants. matters less 75% eligible population vaccinated. I've already experienced firsthand many people ""never getting vaccine"" end getting it. mom one them. putting cart horse here. Herd immunity COVID completely unknown even scientists.

Well that’s entirely true. quick google search take cdc : 250 persons age 17 died us covid . doesn’t touch hospitalized lingering symptoms . 

I’m saying “keep kids shut closet forever “ . agree risk/benefit needs evaluated don’t downplay severity illness . also don’t know look like virus shifts it’s target population adults vaccinated kids not. 70% population immune. 95% effective vaccine would 74% whole population vaccinated, translates 90% adults.

However, vaccine authorized children account people immune infection gets lower. Cases dropping Israel 60% population vaccinated. website differentiates vaccine progress instead one vs two doses, fully vs partially vaccinated?

All ones I’ve seen one vs two, I’ve wondering they’re counting j&amp;j one dose category even though it’s one shot vaccine. evidence Israel, Scotland, USA vaccine highly effective reasons fully vaccinated continue precautions mostly social. work Fortune 50 company. way demand get vaccine, way scared news reason.

Next shot end month. article doesn’t address said. said 95% means 1 20 chance *does create immunity*, 1 20 chance *being infected* like seem think said

This article compares measles vaccines *is* broad herd immunity communities herd immunity doesn’t exist, outbreaks Thank you! exactly gotten much negative attention compared pro-lockdown governors honestly even last spring never big fan her. weird little rules really pointless top. didn’t know much COVID last spring think even safe say buying seeds using boat gas wasn’t going get sick. 20% increase past 3 weeks definitionally upswing. Yesterday cases reported since February. sure else call it? remember subreddit going ga-ga J&amp;J vaccine. special storage requirements! Single dose! saved!

Nobody paying attention even company giving modest shipping estimates. Pfizer remains real game town. hate i’m downvoted saying but...

“The EU continues leading provider vaccines around world. Six weeks existence mechanism, 249 export requests 31 different countries* granted total 34,090,267 doses, threaten contractual engagements EU vaccine producers. one export request granted. main export destinations include United Kingdom (with approximately 9.1 million doses), Canada (3.9 million), Mexico (3.1 million), Japan (2.7 million), Saudi Arabia (1.4 million), Hong Kong (1.3 million), Singapore (1 million), United States (1 million), Chile (0.9 million) Malaysia (0.8 Source? pretty absurd given much less likely die elderly. How's 5G? /s Awesome, thanks! I've frustrated online I've shopping. impression hardware stores would stock still I'll popping least one weekend I'll check. didn’t care happened them. Yay! think I’ll choosing Pfizer. feeling now? side effects? Depends location. Places like Mississippi could 50%, even lower. place like Bay Area could hit 85% understand government tells one thing, tells complete opposite.... going skeptical, right? 

Or people simply supposed blindly follow government tells them, always? not, supposed know difference? Decently? We're 3rd G10/G20? 3rd bad? mean right?

There's quote somewhere think. Same, knew partial liver transplants living donors seems pretty wild. line mine right California :) understand people forgo jj vaccine wait mrna vaccine many Americans choice get either time frame, no? choice get either day, wouldn’t make sense choose one higher efficacy? confused? now? How's vaccinations working you? J+J AZ similar enough made factory - know contamination issues saw Emergent Maryland.

Both companies committed non profit approach. collaborate switch design higher efficacy (likely due stabilized spike protein)? Got second shot today. I’m feeling excited sort return normalcy grateful eligible relatively early. Let’s see feel tomorrow though lol well, unless aged 70+ chronic illness serious comorbidity I'd say better getting marginally less effective vaccine waiting get another one. again, own. got J&amp;J vaccine first one offered I'm incredibly happy did. I've read it, bad side effects depends strong immune system have, stronger immune system worse side effects may you.

It's reported vaccine's side effects hitting younger people harder older people reason. I'm mid 30s got sore arm first dose, crossing fingers second shot goes way. comes wash, minor expense less that. I’m excited nervous get mine tomorrow. drive two hours Sacramento get since Bay Area bit clusterfuck right now. Well worth finally start getting past this. Can’t wait able travel countries open up. honestly epidemiological basis, too. lot spread tied population density. might able shut lot dangerous cases simply making sure population centers able achieve something near herd immunity.

We allocating based demand right - would probably achieve effect. area excess appointments decrease allotment next batch increase somewhere needs it. 48 hours post Pfizer #1. mildest side effects, it’s lingering stuff like arm still mildly sore (juuuust enough notice) feels bit tight. wee hours wondered whether becoming nauseous grab bin keep bed. nothing came it. nope, well one dose, yes. Meanwhile Germany maybe 15% first vaccine  didn’t help stubborn stupid. shouldn’t done that, can’t realize happened masks work, shouldn’t change making decision whether wear mask first place. 2nd Pfizer dose like 30 hours ago. got headache last night, otherwise feel fine. It’s close enough.

No one saying viruses magical- stay apart, won’t get sick. Obviously.

In terms actual policy, it’s complete failure. shame wrong learning it, certainly repeating ineffective solutions. asking right questions, that's big part reason nonsense. clear, infections and, sometimes, cross blood-brain barrier establish CNS, especially effective immune response suppressing infection outside CNS. author piece writing took one preprint showing *might* happen certain circumstances used speculate wildly incorrectly vaccines. Awesome! Getting there. IT’S TIME! anyone know whether “formally” submitted FDA, typical 2-3 week review like approvals, shorter since amendment? 70-75% probably likely, could really anywhere 60-80% Hurrayyy!! 😊 That’s means Yay!! Second dose Pfizer knocked ass next day. following day totally fine. Worth it. could half bad, without happened compare, Democrats would still blamed. vital things, cant things safely. Billions people caught covid yet still essential tasks. There's ways safely reason believe government solution besides lockdown &amp; “urging patience” year. it’s are. same! fully vaccinated ready par-tay!!!! biggest question bathroom situation handled terms space cleanliness. handled well regardless. many eyes watching done scale first large event back im sure handled well assume *some* margin anyone knows accommodates skin's surface temperature... 

Though assume everyone knows doing. would’ve advertised “color tv” Yep unfortunately still got people spooked. wife really hesitant anything even tho we've vaxxed month. I'd say like 70-75%, think R 5, even variant. Trump made wearing masks problem base.

The pivot ""masks effective"" (retroactively ""we said preserve PPE"") ""everybody wear mask!"" help... Trump. soon Canada! doubt border open Canada vaccinated. Need get cross-border shopping fix long people desire one get shot, shouldn’t get more. don’t want it, fuck them. really good attitude. I'm furious I've lost working years virus. used make really good money beg government handout. I'm vaccinated fully want work I'm allowed. fair Absolutely. great job here.

It often surprises true always ends being. They're literally declining free life-saving medicine. partly fully vaccinated people required test covid exposed. Even symptoms, think many would get tested, unless symptoms severe. 

So think many go undetected. fine great shows vaccines reduce symptoms. important questions much fully vaccinated people spread virus, able quantify unless test track fully vaccinated people.

Hi, writing post, much information impact J&amp;J vaccination practice, simply approved later widely distributed long time studies like nationwide Pfizer AstraZeneca studies could done.

To answer booster question, short answer depends. Boosters may first tested trials people received product pharma company, case, mixing-and-matching may happen immediately.

Ayy literally same! Never hyped needle. skew toward old deaths pretty dramatic. surprised retired medical workers died active even though active ones obviously lot exposure.

Also, masks work pretty well, especially n95s used hospitals. Among healthcare people know seems rate even infection really higher general population, combined super old numbers make sense.  Someone else said 1/4 stat adults, 1/5 everyone. risk Covid much, much greater. Remember, vaccine something tangible felt, saw, chose, doesn’t make dangerous Covid, less tangible something you’re used thinking abstracted sense, real consequences significant measurable risks.

Told separate. Found softball team. sanctioned school. girls. Playing teams. without masks. fuck would see need stand six feet apart masks on? I’m still sure whats unethical here. 

Should tell restaurants they’re allowed require vaccination? Cruise airlines? Somehow force countries allow unvaccinated citizens entry? tools anyone that?

Germany uses retrospective reporting vaccination numbers. probably expect 719k number go bit coming days. think NZ friends pretty normal while? I'm sorry hear that. Certainly us felt way. I'm really glad see things finally improving drastically guys. Unmitigated R0 UK variant estimated 4 5, vaccine children yet. Well absolutely right. Trump pretty much everything else wrong regarding covid, point administrations actions looked malicious April 12th now, previously indeed April 19th. ontario vaccine rollout needs start moving quicker. enough doses stored start ramping giving need start opening restrictions get it. Well see happens next week. Covid Christmas I'm crossing fingers I'm one ones whose first shot worse. first dose bad wasn't. would awesome come fully vaccinated without even mild side effects.

Of course, I'll take side effects come. understand alternative. mean can't prefer *not* happen. really hope colleges stop requiring masks. teach college students drives nuts lecture podium mask president press secretary take speak podium.

80% going happen. Sucks suck. like idea businesses requiring vaccinated continue follow safety protocols. still required wear masks, socially distance, get tested etc. 

If unwilling get vaccinated free riding immunity. Nah. Sorry. anyone simple access vaccine, bulk brainwashed propaganda refuse, time let Darwin handle things. 

I'm going sit around another year, try undo Newsmax Facebook, trying teach mask eating lunch classroom. concerned covid, get vaccine. not, certain point zero empathy.

I also cannot prove Bigfoot actually real, also avoid hiking camping?
I hoping article actually scientific evidence, fear mongering. Oof 4 day weekend coming next week, cannot wait second dose Thursday. AFAIK Marburg plant self-sufficient (as components made EU), although Pfizer's Belgium plant dependent imports.

Also, disagree Pfizer deal reason EU behind. anything, Pfizer/Biontech one supplier point delivered good amount doses. good majority EU's received vaccine doses Pfizer/Biontech.

If anything, would say problem *only* Pfizer/Biontech delivering significant amounts. Whereas UK receives large amounts Pfizer AZ, USA receives lots doses Pfizer Moderna, EU less dependent Pfizer/Biontech AZ shortfall.

Had AZ shipped according schedule, would've twice many total doses given EU currently. bad all.

Besides slightly sore arm shot itself, experienced around 6 hours kind tired listless next evening. 

Smoked little herb, went sleep, woke feeling totally normal.

That it. I've felt fine since. You’re right. again, government isn’t involved (though involved lots vaccine requiring efforts, especially schools).

I’m saying businesses economic incentives enforce policies put vaccinated people ease, right act incentives, it’s violation rights do. 

That’s Yeah need get people vaccinated, allow bodies weeks build immunity vaccinated Thank additional context! time start paying morons get vaccines? Money thing see spurring troglodytic dipshits action remember Biden Harris specifically saying trust vaccine released Trump. How's weather Beijing? None us never ever ever ever ever “safe”. best able “safe enough”.  far less side effects frequency less moderna. free avoid people vaccinated. go public spaces. body forcing near people.

I hope everyone though.  considering UK part europe.

If I've learned one thing British media, UK mighty continent middle Atlantic, centered US Europe. miserable you? God people bane society. I'm Moderna rocks man father me.  one place I've worked get flu shot. want get mark badge wear mask work. would ok measures like COVID. I’ve doses Moderna husband drink tons water side effects either dose injection site soreness. best friend exists coffee nicotine, side effects doses Moderna second worst, sick covid like symptoms 3 days. worst night. already vaccinated (I'm assuming ever became thing vast majority would vaccinated) would care others around aren't?

Your risk significantly reduced eliminated. still die covid serious symptoms vaccinated. could get mild symptoms spread said, agree would definitely benefit, became socially unacceptable people go public sick wearing mask (as believe case much Asia already) could also similar affect, help reducing spread flus colds.

True, people well. could support both. 

My take period lots people vaccines still significant spread virus. Basically right US.

In period, open private businesses requiring vaccine limited number high risk non-essential events. cruise concert play. 

In months level vaccinations reduce spread low levels thus restrictions needed all. documents supposed 40 June. seems unlikely EU allowing export proportion EU receiving. UK expects order end June administered July. 

They expecting 7 doses month expect 4 million doses April delaying second doses.

They expect 12 million June later rather 7 million monthly No. reason think they’re different they’re fundamentally different. vaccine isn’t eugenics it’s fucked comparison make.

If people don’t want get vaccine that’s choice, don’t want concert venue one venue gives option avoid another doesn’t, I’m going take dollars one does.

""You evidence except evidence like"" LOL share foreign borns Sweden passed Estonia 2015. 
And Latvia right well. never fan 2 week shutdowns slow spread whatever, never really anything two weeks make pandemic go away. really wishful thinking.

You could argue two week pause right now, focus vaccinations would actually huge effect probably end pandemic US. course won’t happen. good make shutdown successful long gone, thanks useless “pauses” guess today simp Fauci instead hate him. openly admitted basically lying this. short answer deaths reported today still connected November-February wave. 

COVID takes kill, especially medical treatment, difficult turn life support person unconscious without preexisting Resuscitate order (even longer family members insist ""doing everything"" keep loved one alive). 

Furthermore, reporting delays. Counties even hospitals different reporting procedures delay timely reporting. states requiring, example, formal certification person dying ""of COVID"" rather ""with COVID"" prevent COVID-positive individual died car crash included (as happened April 2020 Colorado). often takes month verify.

Finally, death counts generally given date reported, date occurred. deaths California reported April 8, example, happened March. ""people died today"" bit rather ""people whose deaths verified caused COVID today."" get first Moderna tomorrow. I'm little nervous, also want get done ASAP. Glad hear mild reaction! Approaching decided get vaccine binary way going work. probably need gentle nudge. hurry simply nervous it. would guess categories rather third actually anti vax.  Yes, bit late. Yeah, think we'll see anymore either. Honestly reasonable course action. people comply safety measures so, many thrown hands point restrictions mandates pointless. honestly since last summer. Shots arms hope. Statistically Covid less dangerous young children flu. preface this, anti science anti vaxx. Prior contracting covid December, followed every recommendation barley left home. getting vaccine contracting covid constantly kept tabs phase trials news regarding it. question 

When covid, lucky mild go it. fever less 12 hours sinus congestion, never cough SOB thank god, lost sense smell taste days. take atleast month half feel back myself. 

When comes vaccine, everyone know far covid took vaccine saying it’s way tougher go covid, fevers spiking 102-104, horrible body aches, etc. 

From layman self read people reinfected, small is, milder asymptomatic experience. 

My question vaccine causes individuals contracted horrible symptoms, reinfection stats show milder form illness 1st, incentive getting it. seems like much back forth information people covid recovered getting vaccine (only need get one shot example)

Once again, I’m everyone wants vaccine (whether covid not) get help us get generational shit show. personal stance would love feedback. Thanks! French people know wait list ready go, guess know France. Yes. They're definitely allocating much rural areas enough rest us. separate age comorbities ask healthy 20 something risk vaccine. understand people would want wait another option. authorities say 14 days 2nd dose.

This PR stunt fell it. Side effects common younger people, story dad odd. think preference vaccine selfish all. completely natural. One thing keep mind bad stories people good experiences reactions generally ones posting online. personally could attribute credit getting operation warp speed started, think could've done it. matter president is, think something like operation warp speed would've started funding vaccine development bare minimum. mention, one vaccines US uses even take money US. hard working scientists get credit book. know.

As noted above, though, case counts criteria. Readily available vaccinations bigger one me. ok receive immunity naturally? Allen clot thickens... think already AZ too. read news BNT, family GP told mum unrelated visit, recieved both. know doses per vial AZ? city that? good idea federal government expects get 2021, 70.5m (or 73.5m AZ rather assume lower estimate) doses Q2 10.1m J&amp;J needs one dose.

We population ~84m ~15m age 16 69m left.

Literally everytime try find appointment everything booked up. even know I'll get vaccinated year tbh things improve No, development solely BioNTech. partnership Pfizer began April, vaccine candidates long developed (I read somewhere done January, can't find source though). rest time testing approval process, that's Pfizer stepped really helped process think that's CureVac still struggling (CureVac pioneers technology). BioNTech CureVac prior experience getting vaccine market. Thank guys amazing post. 

Do thoughts Sputnik V vaccine? First dose like flu shot plus headache me.

Second dose gave chills hours, slept (since happened night). fatigued headache next day, sorta like hangover minus nausea. Completely fine afterward.

Honestly, bad all, knowing exactly going side effects hit (plus knowledge actually sick they'd go away quickly) made super easy bear.

Second dose month ago point, delayed side effects anything popped (some people seem concerned curious those).

10/10 would again. Lol nice. like live, use indicators, non concern going. France love it. live here, I’m moving US soon. Kinda happy, Ontario shitshow right restrictions continued well April May. I’m pretty sure point knew people going Lowe’s issue think end two three covid19 vaccines left. Pfizer/BNT advantage massively scaled production supply chain world wide. 

* proven highly effective far little side effects. 
* finish trials teens already running trials childrens. 
* production scaled worldwide hit delivery targets. 

Everybody else trying catch least behind one metrics. might turn winner takes situation end. Don’t know US U.K. worrying trend non-white groups refusing worryingly, data 15 January 2021 show substantially lower rates covid-19 vaccinations among 80s ethnic minority (white people 42.5%, black people 20.5%) deprived communities (least deprived 44.7%, deprived 37.9%) England.6 Similarly, data NHS trust show lower covid-19 vaccination rates among ethnic minority healthcare workers (70.9% white workers v 58.5% South Asian 36.8% black workers; P&lt;0.001 That's long shot IMO. I'm hoping 70%. I'm expecting 2/3rds. Cuomo literally holding press conferences encourage black people get vaccinated adult population. adult + children. 12+ sure next school year. surprised lower ages well, I'm sure odds are. ≠ causality

Sounds like could take advice yourself. Got get /s else people might question sanity That's really interesting projection. think current infection hospitalization rates (which similar 5 weeks ago) impact death rate projection created? Def try cvs tried everywhere got CVS 2 days. CureVac produce UK. Maybe second generation vaccine only?

Yes, next generation ones done UK. signed agreement develop GSK British Government - already ordered 50m doses That’s adult population. adults + children. ""I refuse believe conflicts existing biases"" Goddamn know feeling. Thanks man, worries. Always good informed. 1st dose guy last week. mild flu symptoms sore arm next day, beyond everything good Many countries already “soft passport” requirement negative test proof vaccines travel.

 Hahahahaha Really? think entire CDC conspiring? thought Reuters good aged. aren’t actually, faster don’t take time check sources. absolutely hope I’m wrong, think we’re going see lot excuses upcoming months: well can’t X kids haven’t vaccinated yet. can’t possibly consider rolling back X measure anytime soon we’ll get boosters variants.  didn’t like ending kids vaccinated.

Oh god that’s amazing Kids little risk themselves. Problem spread others (home &amp; family) like everyone else. adults vaccinated, would kid spreader risk. given perhaps 25% vax refusers, Covid might continue low simmer years. time might come escape variant whole world start over. millions unnecessary deaths.

Nope, shit. people never get contacted go depth enough. People also misinterpreting article. cases directly attributed outdoor transmission. large proportion cases considered community transmission, basically meaning know came from.

It suggested one scientist actual figure 1 20. Still much safer indoors, competely like headline implies. Correct. idea, people use excuse anti-vaxx.  Herd immunity thresholds less unknown highly dependent setting.

We early R0 estimates \~2.5 Wuhan, rising roughtly 3.0-3.5 later assessments places. settings, like early cruise ship outbreaks, R0 estimates high 13.

The herd immunity formula simple: *Vc* *=* (1− 1/*R0*)/*E ,* Vc: critical minimum proportion vaccinated, R0: basic reproduction number, E: vaccine effectiveness transmission

So Covid's R0 3.2 E mRNA vacccines 0.9, get herd immunity threshold 77%. 77% population immunity prior infection vaccination, new outbreaks tend grow. prevent growing outbreaks cruise ship setting (like *Diamond Princess*) R0=13, we'd need crew/passengers immunity perfect vaccines, \~100% coverage current roughly 90% effective mRNA vaccines. also geotagged specific business Well, heard end answer definitely said expected restrictions eased, depending context epidemiology. provincial authorities ones deciding things transition normality. mean things would stay right forever, meant every situation would different. basically vague answer. sharing joy receiving second Pfizer dose yesterday. I’m anxiously awaiting side effects—but 16 hours later sore arm report. ??? indication number would Trump still president? I'm sure ""reliable"" information is, wacky Pfizer/Moderna unless get J&amp;J sooner. That's good idea. us feel effective teaching online.

Then right. mean offend. reality. much angst things effective teaching enough attention getting job #1 done. mom got Pfizer grandmother got Moderna. dad also scheduled get Moderna.

So far nobody family gotten J&amp;J.  True, lot us want doses *now*. I'm hoping work way alleviate problems work who's susceptible. 4,5 million. far numbers incredibly low. likely die long road trip currwnt numbers. think completely independent within EU wrong word, Switzerland Canada also part BT's global supply chain.

BT's goal completely independent US still export bans.

Until Pfizer producing 40% active ingredients vaccine, Biontech producing close 60%, one-sided deal since US allow exports (not even mRNA first produced, purified, concentrated filtered.

Swiss company Novartis also negotiating contract produce DNA molecules used first next step, mRNA encased fatty envelope. lipids supplied German firms Merck Evonik Industries AG, Austria's Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH, Canada's Acuitas Therapeutics Inc., Germany's Dermapharm Holding SE helping final step, solution filtered filled vials, process known finish fill. done Delpharm SAS, French company; Siegfried AG; Baxter Oncology GmbH Germany; Novartis, Dermapharm Sanofi. educated, believe science, etc. specifically terrified vaccine. 

I'll ok choose vaccinate, also agree isolate themselves. Example:

In Uruguay, first group receive vaccine included teachers, march (southern hemisphere, start year education) could start students high schools. Results?

60% teachers actually vaccinated. 40% choose to.

But 40%, majority (seems them) still went jobs person teaching.

Results? 2 weeks start high school, 50% high school institution Uruguay capital city least 1 class quarantine. idea early vaccination effort teachers student actually attend teaching person.

Relatives family Uruguay received sort letter (sorry, spanish, google translate portion it):

""
We communicating inform one members teaching staff generation notified us today tested positive Covid-19. last day Institution last Friday, March NN. Faced confirmed case, authorities immediately consulted determined follow following steps preventive measures:

All 3rd year High School students (who direct contact teacher) go quarantine least 7 days.

Once period elapsed –Friday, March XX– M.S.P suggests corresponding swab carried out. must managed health providers student individually. 

""


Net effect? country testing system completely overwhelmed, teacher high school, two three groups going quarantine, student swabs, parents family, on.

And EDUCATED people vaccinate, KEEP GOING around business people nothing happened. There's rule ask vaccinated not.

It offered weekly test teachers receive vaccine. rejected it. Sweet. I’ve trying find location appointment SC since opened up

Funny, didn’t think taking cure global leaders spreading shit would *bad* thing, maybe I’m loopy first vaccine  carrot fails motivate it’s time break stick. places restrict access services non-vaccinated, people come along. honestly don’t care people begrudgingly, long it. religion Christian Scientists (the mother ironic names) prohibit vaccines? hopes pinned bailing youth sports, extracurriculars, approval vaccination 12+. reaction answer question irrational part...  hopefully years Lyme, TB, Flu, HIV, Mono, Hep, mRNA vaccines getting pumped facilities. Janssen start delivering EU around April 20. Also EU supply chain independent US one. means problems independent US manufacturing snafus. what's point original post? delete posts? Operation Warpspeed, Biden continues follow, bare minimum. plan develop, produce, distribute vaccines virus. 

There way Biden, January 7th, changed course plan, tweeked meaningful way put us are.

His executive orders say thing Trumps. Full normality probably it’s starting feel like we’re slowly progressing somewhat better time. Attitudes already seem shifting masks. people get vaccinated, bold probably feel wear masks vaccine essentially mask, provided people it. 

A months ago worried time kept looking eyes unvaccinated person. fear basically restrictions becoming lax, likelihood catching would probably go mask use would go guards would let down. time forgot add upcoming vaccine mix basically erases fear. Defense virus go WAY versus mask “good faith” society. also eliminates uncertainty person meet interact vaccine.

With vaccines we’ll slowly get there, course it’s soon say we’ve beaten it. vaccine easy get flu shot local drug store, that’s feel made it. Well they're activating 5g majority pop vaccinated raise suspicions, duhh. Raytheon, changing world one government defense contract time mean, really ""cleaner"" lot ""wiping surfaces"" show point? feels later me. Bruh family like this. use Apple Duck Duck Go, still use Gmail. Oh god, too. aweful. :) Same, side effects kicked around 2am me. children new at-risk group now, since elderly, healthcare workers, immunocompromised/pre-existing condition people vaccinated, adults want vaccine end summer latest? sterotype off, Germans form efficiency. system works, stick runs like clock, system stick convene committee discuss changes. new?  thing ""herd immunity"" bothers people talk like possibility - everyone 16 excluded getting vaccinated. would guess somewhere around 1 4 Americans. wedding isn’t huge. get vaccinated, receive vaccine card. pretty easy enforce really vaccine? like we're accurate deaths either.  Many governors decided make pandemic politicial cover things going far set police raid data scientist whistlesblowers house Florida among things like former president declaring test less keep numbers down. country... ie place pay taxes. Whatever country is. countries fault taking care countries. That's point. 

That assumes obligations human beings. country sitting pile food country B starving, think morally neutral let starve every country North-Korea unto free market playing here. paid, advance, doses. cheaper, IE profitable!, companies ship products closer manufacturing location away. 

That's free market works all. think companies export based proximity? legally can't export vaccines US meet standing orders, US allow it.

If selling TV, bought TV, US government blocking export, that's exactly free believe Americans skip head line. way. pay use internal manufacturing get us this. like import items China. held prices offer. supply demand holding. 

Well that's entire point.

The vaccines rolling factory floor. US paid them, Canada paid them, knows else orders. Everybody orders outstanding. factories can't deliver orders, US government blocking exporting.

In placing orders, everybody equal, blocking exports, US essentially moves front line. item short supply, means advantage one party, comes expense another. US advantages itself, disadvantaging non-US world Americans, paying money, using companies run manufacturing US nationalism? want vaccine ship abroad!?!? Wut?? 

YES!

There vaccines produced. US paid them. parties paid them. Everybody paid money, everybody sense.

Now question is, get situation everybody order product, situation 1 buyer getting orders filled?

The way happen, single buyer somehow advantaged others. case, US placing ahead outstanding orders, making legally impossible factories fulfill orders.

That moment, one country skips ahead line ahead everybody else, that's vaccine nationalism. nationalism, real motivating reason, nationality. sick people healthy people, rich people poor people (although partially/indirectly), Americans US produce them! Private companies did!! nothing nationalism. Money talks. That's sad state world say US stopping infrastructure blame blame sake. Build rely us assholes. Hell really would. 

Obviously private companies, think US communist country? kind open door comment that.

It's money talks, orders filled based paid most, they're filled US government blocks companies filling order country. Last checked, US government private company.

Sure, we'd love whole world get Pfizer right now, option. Moderna - 1st shot nothing major note - 2nd shot - low grade fever body aches, next day only. bad guess happens honor contracts keep yourself.... consequences years come fir trade relationship wold. came pass US trusted... right! economy must collapsed without rich westerners coming in!!

Oh. invest invest complain countries ""hoarding"" vaccines? Wow 😳 way. COVID horrible financially hospitals. 

They make money things like elective surgeries, negatively impacted covid outbreaks. Try Indiana. Muricans aren’t bunch selfish monsters? Reddit NZ third world country desperate money!!! fuck NYC going get rid 11pm curfew? risk part vaccinated, let people live lives point like Fauci knew 55% said 80-90% fuck us. data comes change messaging. Similar CDC saying fomite transmission big deal recently recommending cleaning surfaces that. Lol! saying German? I'm curious obviously changed goal posts again.  intial narrative save lives vaccinating vulnerable 90 percent deaths people 60 over.   make sure covid cases go zero make sure nobody gets sick anymore.  course nobody wants sick going live rest lives precautions social distancing restrictions every person vaccinated. comparison output EU, USA, India, China negligable.

This isn’t efficiency, it’s advantages. southern QC you’re plane, secure mask first helping others.

How different? It’s „corrected right now“. always enough orders.

And obviously exports problem pretty much one exporting. Why? US way cases per capita still, way way . US like 3-5x infected per capita basis still 

Just daily new infections finally starting decline Canada levels, American infected still? Mediocre hard rock musician turned mediocre pundit mediocre crazy old man. Probably thing said drugs lawyers commercials ' someone know developed cancer taking xyz drug? might entitled compensation... totally fine. CDC, typically pretty darn risk averse, explicitly says Visit inside home private setting without mask one household unvaccinated people risk severe illness got mine too. Also felt great day.. incident squirrel.  Isn’t Yakima WA? might know 'paycheck paycheck' follow tv series 'hand mouth'. 

More seriously, large portion people effectively daily wage earners families places high density. question becomes maybe eat maybe covid, going challenging answer smeared politics. spot on. Lockdowns work. masking.

I never said didn't. entire premise flawed presumption. enough vaccines? Could leaders Europe care enough vaccines make effort procuring them? also found that, existing, in-person connections people company longer, find interacting people worked pandemic hired within last year. mostly problem? Yes. one problem? Almost certainly not. imagine newer hires probably different take company culture us actually interacted person before.

Overall, I'd okay hybrid system guess. I'd probably still choose go five days week allowed year I'm sick spending 12 hours day home office (8 work another probably 4 leisure). two things workplace could tell would prompt start seeking another job. One would working home full time permanently (VERY much doubt happens, WFH couple days week, even that). would implementing hot desks. that. like desk, like chair set right generally space. much want work home full-time anymore, would take option every single time in-person job hot desks least home, space. Working office hill may consider dying on, desk hill absolutely die on, questions asked. Thank you! 62 doses may contaminated 15 million contaminated. thousands doses expiring local level. 

What China besides giving hundreds millions doses poorer countries? would expect countries infrastructure capabilities develop vaccines? exported Covid-19 vaccines. Yes proof it. India reporting low numbers namazis shouting hiding numbers Okay, BJP Mamata, Blah blah blah Bhakt.

I've heard vaccines past year 6 years prior. messaging constant consistent. think honestly convince people already said? need Frank Luntz sit every fucking knucklehead country little ""I'm going change mind making look like idiot televised focus group"" routine? Great point. Even 1/4 people don’t get it, covid circulate predominantly among enough people infected reach herd immunity Thank you, aware risks. going wear mask spray Lysol showing up. plan place ensure safe visit. also fully vaccinated well pass two week waiting period. work public get tested weekly covid. mask wearing, hand washing, social distance practices never positive year. also continue safety practices long reach 80% vaccination rates US. Sure, unclean surfaces, severe allergies like childhood onset peanut allergies happen we're raising young sterile environments? 

(BTW, fun thing, ever want discover new species. Swab surface examine bacteria, find several never seen species.)

Not mention we're killing trying remove beneficial gut bacteria. But, hey, life, live it. Well close 1/2% vaccines used 2 dose. faith vaccine? care people get it? I've vaccinated I'd happy spend day hotel room fiance's family sincerely believe vaccine works. Almost one who's vaccinated infected even fewer gotten severe symptoms. care people choose put risk statistically harm you? South East Michigan openings find. Maybe north open cities point helpful convincing people. never going insult ridicule someone getting vaccinated. Chronic salmonella? Wow, til Yeah feels exactly like hangover three weeks ago lol bad Holy fuck, I’m dude Reddit, literal fucking President United States

*Clearly, I’m problem here* moron spouting gibberish global crisis

Trump apologists like must save companies fortune hire window cleaners, crayon budget must roof real concern mine. They’ve absolutely become tribal symbols even though serve important purpose.

In case, leaving “us” joining “them” soon I’m fully vaccinated proper officials give clear. I’m playing stupid games. means wearing mask pandemic throwing away it’s over. felt feverish took temperature normal plan well, made oatmeal tea, + advil nap docket today haha wrong Curious got vaccines doctors offices even highly paid concierge doctors can't get yet clients. Hes watching much YouTube afraid Bull Gates microchip. problem vaccinations far covid widespread lots vaccinated people still get covid. already know two people fully vaccinated got covid one claims vaccines fake news got covid fully vaccinated. going plenty people mindset. think strategy UK Israel much better US opening economy cases low quite bit vaccinated. still lot cases around country lot hotspots. doesn’t help lot people assume vaccinated go live however want without precautions. bunch fucking knobs. lie people. I've traveled parts rural Louisiana pandemic, places person gas stations wearing mask, places people least likely seek vaccination concentrated. R(t) may never fallen much 1. virulent strains UK, SA, Brazil, greater tolls young, enroute.

I think we're going see bifurcation outcomes well- poorly- educated, pro-science scriptural literalist, urban rural. communities where, thanks partisan anti-science anti-vaccination media consumption, Covid-19 outbreaks continue pop years, going forward. pretty wild people refusing vaccine large groups, apparently county live one highest %s whole country people willing get vaccine (over 95%), hard terms supply distribution now, better long-term.

I understand initial hesitation happened quickly average person following FDA authorizes conducts clinical trials etc. may seem questionable little scarier. work pharma medical research regulations/funding day job keep what's going even sort glad first wave jabs, setting aside work knowledge personal feelings. we've gotten huge groups people, elderly older folks healthcare workers, without major issues associated vaccine itself, hope people start put aside hesitancy start see ""oh look neighbor/brother/niece/coworker etc."" got end 5G chip drop dead it, it'll normalized. even mention fringe group who's worried 5g lot people trust certain pharmaceutical companies? material facts changed? vaccines efficacy rates known we’re even ahead estimated timelines dispensing vaccine. tell what’s changed subjective opinion? Yep, we’re adding bit 1% every day. couple weeks we’ll there. Yep able get 70-80% range within 6-8 weeks. know still spread COVID getting vaccine. might still dangerous seem them. would wait longer you.... whole issue ""polarization, politics, media, social media"" ideologically symmetric problem. post-truth framework creating politically divisive wedge issue pandemic much similar solipsism political nihilism drive anti-vaxx movements. 
 
I'm honestly little bit sick people hand waving stuff away ""divided society"" tropes. Society divided much significant chunk decided reality truth whatever want be, regardless science, regardless reason, regardless evidence, consensus, convention common sense. want Anthony Fauci get TV calmly discuss consensus emerges best current framework objectively observing reality? 
  
I think like ""oh, people believe flat earth, people believe 4.4 billion year old rock traversing galaxy 200km/s... divided anyone know believe anymore?"" excuses ignorance people need another excuse... said, it‘s fine us made decision, people telling ‚money talks‘ stuff like never mattered wrong. 

The us took path frankly it‘s great american tax payer, guys hate it? 
The eu limiting it‘s exports specific problems suppliers - also understandable still roughly export 50% produced vaccines. Mind us also buying eu vaccines. think Texas restriction government mandating vaccine passports entering government property using services. contracts? started feeling bad ~8 hours shot. bad chills night, felt crummy next day, felt fine evening. I'm sure United States developed reputation country want vaccines. obviously countries much lower hesitancy us, we're anything extraordinary regard, lot countries large proportions population like getting vaccinated. Given public hysteria around events, hope people never Google side effect rates medicines take regularly without even stopping think.

Would clearly induce mass panic. leftist - same. everyone wants vaccine fully gotten them, better completely open back up! That's pretty ironic statement, considering people want vaccination specifically know long term side effects might be. great article. wish would've posted full panel.

People worrying getting 80%+ immunity missing point. COVID-19 going endemic, goal really get enough immunity numbers fall manageable levels. we're fairly low incidence, maintain regular vaccinations much possible like every virus.

There going day suddenly hit herd immunity cases drop zero. We're going slowly get back normal numbers drop. employees complicit. take rambling instructions inject bleach, speaks intelligence anything. well put. like say reproductive rate virus determined intersection biology behavior. average across larger numbers behaviorally distinct groups (think cruise ship passengers vs New Zealanders), applications, you’re going potentially obscure interesting dynamics. 

What’s interesting degree virally permissive behaviors (anti-mask, anti-vaccination, congregate without distancing) assortative. is, people exhibit behaviors tend associate similar people? know political opinions tend cluster people relevant behaviors correlate bit politics, leaves open possibility. 

So variable environmental settings, could robustness another large scale outbreak still recurring brushfire outbreaks selectively sweep communities people whose behaviors make susceptible tend associate other.  CDC estimates *least* hundred million infected, probably much now. virus rarely severe. hit 75% country getting vaccinated, really think thing totally control. Vaccine induced immunity wonderful, infection induced immunity real strong. 7 day moving average clearly upswing. reason partly plateaued every holiday weekend dip. Even dip, 20% low. Hospitalization intake also plateaued even concerning (total hospitalizations actually ticked up, lot legacy long haul patients January peak). 

Is crisis? No. Hospitals overwhelmed. disappointing. We're 4-5 weeks ""all clear"" people cutting caution early. AZ vaccine shows system works. realized 30’s higher rate blood clots, investigating start handing doses people (at least US). 

If anything make confident approved vaccines safe. vaccinated /r/niceguys least US think we're going see common. Pretty sure baseball stadiums opened required vaccination/negative test. beg differ. fact internal external borders closed huge economic impact. could tourists enter, know millions dollars lost due cancelled contracts, many situations.

All Europe deaths minimal summer, countries open, like Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein even open Germany.

There big difference list 'open' country open borders countries. (Not mention closed internal borders) took us lose percent population make easier numbers. problem everywhere soon. 18yo babysitter western PA becomes eligible Monday. got right instantly found appointment.  Hopefully diligent lucky. really hard find weeks ago. 

I feel like 25-30% holdouts coupled ineligible age really cause problems coming months.

Ironically it’s usually people complaining long pandemic. every turn proven pro Covid people ever met, gobbling regurgitating tidbit information enables feel charting right path. 

Yet talking points/desired approach society literally Brazil’s top strategy (much chagrin Brazil’s local healthcare professionals systems). 

And yet point Brazil worst days speak (4000 deaths yesterday) pawn idea it’s 3rd world country (in minds).  literally pro HCQ person ask knew taking really HCQ counterfeit drug. 

The postmortem pandemic obviously show limitations lockdowns mask mandates brutal large swaths people refuse vaccines prefer let rip.  Ironically almost person seem “prolife” position abortion.  Thus defined EU leader. EU leaders: There's much black/white thinking Reddit

Black/white thinking, also called catastrophic thinking, sign depression anxiety. Reddit easy outlet people issues think gets expressed real life. know people never left house last year, despite opportunities safely, feel bad gotta think best them. lot information coming virus spreads like wildfire children. might significant amount natural immunity already there. can't possibly say enough keep case numbers down, disingenuous ignore discussing that. Pretty sure 15 million doses ruined 62 million doses need checked contamination. algebra Yes! people say Capitalismnis worst lol don’t like either, still think it’s preferable changing policy fact. don’t problem places like EU stopping exports, it’s flip flop dislike. still think made correct decision, it’s unfortunate. even popular: pointing fingers countries. fair lot good news since last summer. easy become pessimistic cynical news mostly consist ""the politicians willfully ignorant everything sucks"".  potential development impacts restrictions kids non zero could ultimately produce harm virus.

Nothing life riskless. Taking kid Disney land non-essential risks. eliminate activities risk risk much sadder disordered society. Yes Florida one crazy. People wishing would lock like Canada. Yikes - get vaccinated move on. well still put herd immunity risk, since still know herd immunity number. that's I'm getting title. really care yearly vaccination efforts, care getting virus enough control wear mask, use strict capacity limits, shut restaurants, close movie theaters conventions, sort thing.

I problem getting vaccinated. problem life abnormal. we're position anyone wants vaccinated vaccinated, I'm voting politicians favor health restrictions. really simple me. put Dutch number context German number concluded DE currently vaccinating 3x people NL. Lol. Imagine entire country freedom whatever one wants due nearly non-existant case counts thinking someone ""prisoner"" can't engage international travel.

Sorry, known massive luxury? Can't prisoners. I'm Michigan generally there's really poor messaging signups lists public private sector interact.

In areas, getting public list also direct private options become available. others wont.  probably importantly, often non-obvious case particular locality.

Where am, local government signup, clinics actually run public health authorities. Private options available, criteria eligibility varies wildly investigate one see can/will take you. 

You find own, there's authoritative source delivering message population large way get lost noise. Ah yes, genius “take credit Pfizer’s vaccine even though developed Germany” 

How could forgotten? genuine leadership time crisis, grandma could survived see similar mind set. fully vaccinated full strength resume normal activities forwent proper precautions. going foolish pile bar max capacity movie fabrics mask yep sounds perfectly doable full strength then, much longer term serious issue hand. Science currently time post indicates known variants us mitigated adverse death effect hospital level care right even milf symptoms seem controlled. till stats change gonna proceed. change view. also expect booster 9 months variants. Uhm know science works?

You look statistically significant disparity trial group control group. 

If people strokes, heart attacks, etc higher rate covid+ population, suggests link needs study. That’s we’re now. One week second dose Delay Refusal key.

Delay bad Refusal. ""Complacency, convenience"" mitigated/incentivized.  actually get 75% I'd thrilled. diffent I'm saying? Bro specifically terrified vaccine. 

But **why**? Ignorance misinformation. That's it. nothing else. irrational position, exactly like people shown interest learning topic making informed decision. single one even shred evidence support asinine opinion, makes functionally indistinguishable ""true"" anti-vaxxers. 

If position equally harmful, arrived position way, intention ever backing position......then *what's fucking difference*? True, death severe aliment child treated seriously 80 year old. 

I really hope enough adults get vaccinated large issue. Since kids 12 asymptomatic doubt notice cold getting passed around. Oklahoma. great job marketing government waiting lists, distribution effort doesn’t match upfront expectation getting official list right thing do. “I’ve list since January, I’ll get turn” — meanwhile CVS, Rite-Aid, Kroger, etc, getting much supply county don’t use list. mean don’t get wrong, trump lot harm helped, pandemic otherwise.

I blaming anyone Trump outcomes legacy. 

I saying operation Warp Speed good idea paid country. town 100000 Texas 70 percent eligible adults least one shot. averaging 500 cases week January 30 live NJ I’m glad it’s almost one week Easter holiday hasn’t caused noticeable spike cases far. 

I know it’ll take two weeks examine effect holiday numbers though. Alternate headline: 75% Americans Want Caccine, putting Herd Immunity Well Within Reach Clocks ticking ever vaccine get hands on. Technically J&amp;J get time long run probably Moderna/Pfizer, difference marginal. Yeah vaccine so... know heck ""take rate"" is.

My initial thought ""percentage eligible population willing take it."" That's probably perfectly honest. hesitancy among health care workers first batch well documented.

Pick favorite pollster probably provide series polls possibly early mid April show positive trend willingness take (maybe slight blip Sept/Oct Donny running mouth rushing thing). December actually authorized vaccine, things gotten better better.

Daily doses continue rise can't ""take rate"" means.

So, exactly ""take rate?"" attest one people. get flu shot every year children vaccines up-to-date. means anti-vax. we've covid, tested positive antibodies, see point getting vaccine right now. going re-evaluate soon test antibodies see there's data soon variants natural immunity, probably sway us one way another.

What wish people would realize flu vaccine MMRs. new vaccine emergency use going cause hesitancy pro-vaxxers, especially natural immunity right now. I'm at-risk covid right (given current data) greatest risk vaccine side-effects, seems next none. refreeze ship elsewhere? Eat shit die penniless redneck.

You wonder people ""vilify"" you? conspiracy, really much piece shit disgust around you.

Now simply need add vaccinated requirements! want insurance companies able start dictating care based persona choices. opens doors denying coverage pre-existing conditions like diabetic cancer, smoking, obese, etc. Also probably reason medical professionals hesitant. actually ones hospital watching people come after, witnessing it. can't get one OH? drove PA OH get last week issues getting appointment state. less issue months, grocery stores doctor's offices tons doses spare. They'll offering anyone passes through. Picking milk eggs? get vaccine it? USA! USA!

Basically, there's little risk them. said would get one fauci approved of...which did...

“If public health professionals, Dr. Fauci, doctors tell us take it, I’ll first line take it, absolutely,” said. “But Donald Trump tells us take it, I’m taking it.” girlfriend autoimmune disease needs avoid anything inflammatory. well known autoimmune disease community avoid Ibuprofen specifically cause inflammation. school pretty okay since January tbh people getting vaccine. kids know drill school teachers keep enforcing it. schools that's case higher numbers. school staff sticklers children. sounds like I'm saying Thai response really nailed it, got right, overreaction. price came that; really locked down. work data center company, infrastructure provider, monitoring guys facilities engineers there, managers. Bangkok ghost town. great experience. 20 percent population kids give take (22 percent 18 16+ get vaccinated). 80 percent eligible. 75 percent 80 60 percent. 20 percent eligible 20 percent won’t take it. assuming even distribution infection probably isn’t accurate way really figure using conservative estimate infection let’s say 20 percent. 20 percent 20 percent eligible 4 percent. 20 percent group take vaccine 4 percent. Meaning 60 percent population vaccinated hopefully sometime summer 8-10 percent maybe additionally natural immunity. you’re looking close 70 percent. enough keep r 1 reversing restrictions. one knows sure hopefully numbers coming countries like Israel UK indicate could enough. vaccinated scenario quote part says countries given doses US? Israel vaccinate entire population multiple times something? UK acts pretty much AZ invested someone internet said you. 

If real life party situation unfolded: asked someone question currently lives Japan currently seeing Japan, butt long-winded lecture human beings, would stare politely listen drone (while inside wishing would shut up).

The beauty internet pretend. ask question found response loooonngggg, condescending lecture. may like fact ""you concise"" many social business circles considered rude windbag...and rude lecture someone response question, someone even talking you.

Anyway, acting fragile. Get it. everyone encounter internet going fan compliment long-winded replies. interested crying that?

Furthermore, odds suffering kind severe outcome COVID post-vaccination essentially nil. pretty safe. Yeah, understood, Belgium vaccinate 2 doses hand. least AZ, possibly all.

*US well vaccinations*

HURR DURR SELFISH BRO 😭 

Bruh, get dick exact thing posted days ago. difference efficacy J&amp;J SA variant. reason need less effective vaccine. yet production capacity still woefully lacking still vaccines ordered. get them, cases September, guess goes first. Adding part judgement call, travelled within Thailand half dozen times last year, ever have. kept promoting domestic tourism stimulus promotions dirt cheap. People Thailand get out, without quarantine coming back, worked offset losing access. nothing extensive, long weekend outings, many short really make sense, nice getting Bangkok. oppressively urban feel 10 million residents traffic bad. 10 million facility Leiden. Weird got details story wrong. are, talking. Definitely least try d3. Ymmv central role immune system function. finally functioning immune system due d3 supplementation I'll kid wondered missed cystic fibrosis case. turns there's going affects synthesis. Hence D3 huge game changer people low. possible meet friend go hiking something? sort outdoor activity. Outside masks reasonable distance pretty damn safe. Poland laughts feable deaths 956 deaths roughly 3% population India. Enrollment super across whole U.S. many going private. difficult find job school year. Positions opening resignations/retirements going fill positions. Oh hope surgery goes well recovers quickly. brunch today? live NKY seen/know people Cincinnati come get vaccine. US banned vaccine exports though? Ahhh, asking underage Covids I'm sorry lost year college. 3 million people died. sympathy muster ... deal it.

and adults chance vaccinated, done dealing it. understand? Especially seeing really take pandemic seriously lot places Duhh need get back work. Kentucky isn’t really leading state numbers aren’t really accurate. doses administered 90% (if look Kentucky gov site number also too, say 90% GOAL, 79% they’re actually doing). number isn’t bad it’s leader either. NH actually 90%, would leader, 79% slightly average.

In terms 50% adults may close although really leader either site linked tracking percent total pop KY 34.5% one shot, 21.3% fully vaccinated. horrible, pretty average also. 

So may fair paint picture KY horrible administering vaccines it’s also accurate paint picture leader. Imagine understanding difference Australia/New Zealand global transport hub like UK. comparison 3 long past. locals saying, optimistic

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’ve seen could reports say wait depending shot get could slightly effect vaccine. heard super hydrated helpful. Either way I’m relieved it’s almost here. Sure, god damn Stranglehold one best songs ever. Clearly you’re unable even comprehend subreddit you’re US men register Selective Service ( draft ) think denied student loans federal benefits.

Maybe come situation regards pademic.

No federal benefits jobs without proof vaccination.

I might suggest company.

I've training new hire confessed going gym daily despite vaccinated.  way want share office breath canned air person like that. ^this Yes, unless directly related job (for example, doctor) companies access personal medical information. don’t actually neither them... swear remember back April 2020 experts said vaccine, could find one, would “be silver bullet” end thing. 

And back hoped even 50% efficacy. TIL: needing things open actually make decent cash pay bills spoiled. typically drink gallon day definitely went day shot 2. I’d heard many people describe effects “hangover like” figured hydration would help out. 


I ended slight headache went away 4 hours Tylenol, barely nausea (like I’ve felt worse nausea public bathrooms), heart rate jump night. Variants. Irresponsible personal behavior. Clueless politicians relaxing restrictions soon. Deniers. Slow vax rollouts. Anti-vaxxers. adds up. still going reduce diversity invaders way? Nice! loved outdoor classes child, rare were. felt like movie cool teacher took kids learn. Haha! Sorry delay, reddit really bad notifications me. That's commendable hell, going back school like that. indivisible writing, kicking kids' assess hahaha. Best luck you! Husband got Pfizer really tired day little sore arm. Hoping shot number 2. Good luck! Fuck might well open crossings MI, first time fully fucked sides border time. 

Someday figure Covid early hold MI 2020 came back time 2021. guess strong seasonal wave get ahead vaccination. states weeks behind us last year really hope thier spring waves get killed vaccines. Buying things creating nothing must boost. Uraguay remarkably spared 2020. per capita bad US peak Yes has.  manufacturing huge amount, happened right rolling Sehr gut “When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci, took first dose Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, told Times. “Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 85.  Brazil buying Sputnik? milf 

But want MILFs controlled  think important add:

What ""efficacy"" mean?

Efficacy measures relative difference given setting levels infection (or symptomatic illness, hospitalization, etc.) group people vaccinated group people unvaccinated.

It measure one person's ""chances"" ""odds"" ""probability"" getting infected given time. also measure ""ready"" ""prepared"" fight infection immune system given time. measurement *relative* number infected people unvaccinated group.

A simplified example: 2 cruise ships, Cruise Cruise B

On cruise, 200 passengers: 100 vaccinated vaccine 90% efficacy infection 100 unvaccinated. breakout occurs ship. 

By time cruises end, 20 unvaccinated people Cruise infected. Based vaccine's efficacy, would expect 2 vaccinated people become infected. 

On Cruise B, breakout severe, infected 80 unvaccinated group. Based vaccine efficacy, would expect 8 vaccinated group become infected.

Same vaccine efficacy number vaccinated ship, 2% vaccinated group got infected Cruise whereas 8% vaccinated group Cruise B did. Yes, vaccine people would stupid get it. you’re young low risk covid may better waiting get one vaccines since available. Right, it’s like state denied permit want *fewer* safety measures.

Most likely scenario Nevada puts lower capacity cap them. happens, they’ve said they’ll either split two weekends move festival October. sure downvoted right. Fauci crept number 50%, 60%, 70% 80% think 90%. talks higher gets. Meanwhile real world example contradicts that. Fauci ""expert"" there. It'll Republican Non-Republican

Political ideology determinant factor right whether someone says want vaccine don't. Yes, thought mine getting crazy specifically Phoenix bad winter seems widespread. Well, people need get better politics, convincing enough people vote changes way forward. 

This nothing Covid. historic, colossal achievement medical innovation perspective logistics perspective. massive efforts supposed sort thing central planning excels at, comforting see America able execute well. Holy shit schizo take meds Cope Israel reportedly opening completely later week. Libs PC interested fightinh even bare minimun ""at least better US""

Both Doug Trudeau impeached Gods green earth painted fool chief ever said two weeks? 3 years, 3 years number I've heard since onset, jackass would said two weeks... fox.

But agreed, 10 years really point, end 10 years even dealing virus, look many variants got year. deaths heart, lung, blood-sugar related

Unlikely realted vaccine. Question vaccine side effects:

Got Moderna shot 3/30 completely fine exception sore arm. Seven days later, however, noted injection site itchy extremely sore touched. Now, (10 days post-vaccine) arm showing light yellow bruising still quite itchy injection site.

I’m particularly worried, seem like low-level side effects me, particular reason might still experiencing week past injection? Also, concerned worse/more dangerous reaction second shot? wrong worried that?

Like, yeah, people much lower risk getting severely ill dying COVID likely skip/miss appointment.

Doesn't necessarily mean get eventually.

The longer campaign goes skewed get towards less motivated people. champing bit would anything get vaccinated already vaccinated. getting ""Shit, forgot Final Four game scheduled shot. Oh, well, I'll get another appointment next week."" people. Approximately 56% Israel’s 9.2 million citizens vaccinated another 15% (approximately 700,000 people) recovered Covid-19, putting Israel comfortably expected herd immunity range.

This says all. 56% vaccination ""comfortably expected herd immunity range"".

This course sharp contrast Fauci requires 80%+ vaccination, opinion pipe dream. vaccines authorized 70% population (adults) starters. Yeah could see that. Pockets infections communities low vaccination. Ah yes, take extra month reopen safe now, reassure public overzealous. well US many high ranking politicians states strict lockdown rules nothing happened them. Rules thee me. exactly. im included: dont get life back anyway take vaccine? Anyone cares wear mask isn’t worth caring about. don’t want wear mask anymore would never shame someone themself. Excellent news! Ever notice whenever something really stupid article eventually makes to, “on Twitter...”. Well, life get back normal vaccinated? No. life get back normal achieved herd immunity? Certainly.  anyone wants shot it

I see potential pathway Alright - 1/2%. *each day*. 4-5% week. point quickly moving toward enough people severely block spread. agree everything said. think bit room full go everyone chance vaccine keep kids locked till get vaccine. me, plan kids return normal routine summer, watching local case numbers still vaccines aren’t full proof see risk members family basically every day. 

So me, kids unvaccinated now, we’ll lot still light local situation given time. Obviously everyone’s situation different think still room account local infection levels along vaccination rates cases. I’m glad I’ll never worry getting lost woods. Bill Gates always know I’m at. Yeah it'll early May. trying get trip start new jobs. Thanks! Moderna #2 fun. regrets though.

I fine rest day, exhausted next two days. called sick slept \~12 hours days.

My partner minor fever, sweating, chills \~1.5 days, also starting \~24 hours second shot. Can't recall one two sick days. First Germans love complain, secondly media experts constantly talking high numbers lockdowns result that, guess people take reason complain high numbers well... vaccines supposed herald heard immunity??? dont stop getting spreading it. reduce symptoms... plan rejected don’t know they’ll haha 100% least 1m vaccines come every week... Outbreaks become localized areas poor uptake become immune hard way. religious peers family members expressed concerns current vaccines

Well, world chaos right paradigms shifted defined longer. Christians abortions front row receive vaccine vegans, standing animals rights animal deaths/ cruelty name food medicine standing right them. Rehoboth/Dewey last week. still way season lot stuff open. Masks required boardwalk ""recommended"" beach. Food mostly take-out could least walk place (last year serve windows). places indoor outdoor seating could take mask sat down. Honestly 80% normal. see lot shuttered places think must survived last year probably hoping big year year. I'd go make best it. Head Indiana. longer residency requirement shots. right, sense injustice rising public despondency absolutely nothing rapidly-eroding sense civic duty. Totally irrelevant! single important thing. helped, things already motion Biden ordered them. Private companies already acting like ordered. private companies already exporting USA shielded liability want first supplies going elsewhere. loan doses Canada Mexico. ontracts operation warp speed. AZ uses wild type spike, S2P (prefusion stabilized spike). Stage One: Denial  Worry people want vaccine first Nowhere say covid vaccines.

And no, definition anti-vax. Anti-vax means vaccinating general, one individual vaccine. can't go get vaccinated flu say ""Oh, GeT ShInGlEs VaCcInE yEaR?? AnTi-vAxXxEr!"" I’ll fully vaccinated two weeks, attending EDC year! excited! already first AZ, danger symptoms hopefully get second. Debbie Downer anything, 100 100 days lot less Trump's 4 million doses 2020
/s think general population vaccinated take least months there’ll modest spike year, probably nowhere near severe last year though. new variants cause concern vaccinated infecting vaccinated people also? also believe vaccines help prevent deaths.

I've really gotta figure get guys' payroll... obviously true, time blame people wanting get given several alternatives effective risks (however small) AstroZeneca. things existed pandemic continue exist (or gotten worse) pandemic, point trying make? EDC 6 weeks. That’s plenty time reach full vaccine immunity they’re taking shot weekend. initial plan states use “health pass” requires either vaccine negative exactly! I'm Lansing area, pain find anything within 60 miles direction. I've trying everything booked out.

I signed Meijer weeks ago register finally got slot 14th.

There enough vaccines places distribute demand area sure. Hello Canada. see America. Well done recovery. gonna lie, looked pretty messy here. it’s us can’t figure delivery game. Trump put family members charge Vaccine distribution. promised 20 million vaccines end 2020. missed mark 16 million.

Biden promised 100 doses 100 days, likely double that.

This complicated. There's reason virtually every Trump business failed. Many countries WOULD meet target Phiser, Moderna, AstraZenica, J&amp;J, monopolize patents vaccines (which US taxpayer paid millions develop), smaller countries able make cheap generic versions.

But alas, capitalism comes global health stability (as usual). Can't wait go lockdown several years never actually eradicated COVID since profitable. think vaccines prevent spike summer? Johnson Johnson sold baby powder asbestos they're fine right now....Johnson Johnson, babies. “full testing observation hasn’t occurred” inaccurate statement. missing data safety 12 months+, bit absurd standard — mechanism would explain dormant long-term effect mRNA gone within days. Otherwise, testing observation given full courses, overlapped rather staggered. 2.5x statistically large.

Probably less difference end end 18-29 group based 6x difference reference group.

Similar story death rates across board. Big jumps age group age group implies big jumps within age group well. Lol, EDC doesn’t want drug sniffing dogs. They’d catch majority people showing festivals. turn blind eye radar, personal use. think wanted old person giving thumbs up. surprise realize 35. Trudeau let politics get way mass vaccinations "" That's partly country decided invest vaccines European factories, afraid US, former president Donald Trump, would issue export bans. "" Add Canada also set factories making vaccines, ton issues there. texas stole hope even pandemic lol. god damn dallas Dang thought US backwater shit hole everyone antivax? Or... let people choose? even need ditch AstraZeneca, people may willing take less demand therefore less waiting time. almost one takes huge surplus, ditch it. current scarcity vaccines many countries, would probably take happen. Misinformation media major problem needs solved cooperation platforms undertake sufficient action prevent it. opinion, ways get people exposed scientific information instead BS read Facebook also implemented.  quick judge. husband discovered mask wearing helps lot pollen season. might continue wear regardless. concern though trial control group - research-inclined thoughts might mean terms possible biased results, would appreciate it.

Big pharma advocating strongly years get rid placebos, results control group usually similar results group given new drugs! need tax don’t get vaccine prevent participating parts society. Part reason believe booster shot makes immunity stick around long term. 2 weeks 2nd dose. vaccines used two dose regiments. 90%+ Pfizer Moderna. vaccines second doses. 

We averaged around 1.7-1.8 million first doses day. slightly 1/2% per day. I’m fully expecting Northeast’s numbers drop get summer South spike cases (nowhere near severe last summer though). probably saved you! believe would one get fever. anyone outside UK barring maybe Spain/EU , part UK.

Well that's works lol. UK specific definition Gibraltar included it. 

According official UK government website, Gibraltar ""does form part United Kingdom itself.""

It’s really hard frontline worker find shot populous city Oregon isn’t enough supply. need stop allocating vaccines places people aren’t taking them. Thank reassuring words, didn’t know better.

I get freaked

It varies state though, much distributed state HS vs fed pharmacy program.  Yea. gave many mixed messages reason. consistent — literally regardless messaging he’s saying, consistent — would cruised victory. sounds like maybe failed listen doctors, then, overwhelming medical consensus get vaccinated. Sounds legislature health department don’t think it’s serious enough anything, states? I’m guessing insist dining playing sports aren’t getting vaccinated anyway.  Right... success government action, throwing money multiple different companies develop vaccines requirements succeed. threw money efforts failed, big deal, time try one approach time. government made deal pay shots entire country. triumph single payer healthcare.

Yooooooo user responding said prolonging pandemic 6 months. going set reminder 6 months, remembered can't comment threads older 6 months old, 5 months I'd time check in.

“If rise contagion, everything open month,” said. would say tighter grip placed talk radio too. still poisonous. Almost mix right wing talk late night conspiracy. HIGHLY dependent there, work, team on. “ said side effects see vaccines currently available”

So...it’s actually better another vaccine. BS tech Problem many older people might refuse AZ bad press. really, safely open country herd immunity. countries screwed ones try open spread since locked countries &lt; 90% vaccination coverage protect rest (note kids 10% country) vaccines administered EU Pfizer anyway  Well, Dr Fauci said doesnt keep one getting spreading, reduces symptoms. sure think looking. dont facebook boy try something else. fucked moronic everthing else still almost got wrong. think thousands deaths could prevented old orange fuckface republican traitors would actually cared people. Wait find people also choke food die car accidents. think unlikely anywhere near 70% immunity US.

The service sector recently gotten vaccinated, huge demographic, also super likely exposed.  patently false. close every country, like Canada did.

Tens thousands Canadians holidays around Europe summer 2020. saw Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, etc. required quarantine arrival either, unlike Canada.

Only November rising cases Germany increase list 'risk countries', reviewed daily/weekly open again.

Canada much closed Europe. simply fact, amount patriotism change. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes I’m familiar VAERS I’ve monitoring spikes unusual side effects. interesting side effects ranging covid2, covid19, death, rash, etc. 

I’m looking US only. I’m also looking countries outside like Japan don’t really give choice even inform you’re getting after.

What I’m trying note math behind probability getting certain side effects AstraZeneca relative competing vaccines. I’m simply stating optics around AstraZeneca terrible. scary side effect, several 1st world countries halted use citing scary side effect. It’s going hard convince people experiencing FUD take it.

My assertion country continues using AstraZeneca vaccination rate likely turn lower fear. Same. Whenever lifted arm first shot, felt like someone grabbed hold shoulder muscle pair pliers. Oh man feel like I'm called here. want change emails first time 13 years ok! finally scheduled j&amp;j shot. feels good man I'm UK I'm 30s Astrazeneca almost certainly I'll offered. briefly considered waiting till could Pziver Moderna privately regulator admitted days ago link blood clots jab getting stronger. However, everyone makes move lockdown continue longer cannot take much lockdown I'm going get Astrazeneca hope best charge you’d make decision? breakthrough cases actually less common expected. 95% efficacy expect seeing least hundreds thousands cases almost 70,000,000 Americans fully vaccinated, we're anywhere close that. mRNA technology utterly miraculous, really think future vaccines. turn table turns!

Kidding. nice see light end tunnel. Even weren’t lying time, actually going believe them? Anyone who’s actually eligible get appointment Impfzentrum. doctors never supply now, cleared give vaccine week (hence jump), known past couple months. would assume stories read accurate. definitely wasn’t huge amount people told eligible somehow left hanging months.

One beaurcrat office 2500 miles away probably worst way distribute something like vaccine scale. best way massively distributed vaccination many individual entities. goal government manage much smaller group distributors distributors focus logistics ground supply/demand needs. case using hospitals, state vaccination sites, pharmacies distribute vaccine. I'm following day gotten second Moderna shot. First shot pretty sore shoulder shot given days felt fine. 

After second shot, started getting arm soreness hours shot last night feeling little fine otherwise. morning, little tiredness getting up, arm pretty sore again, fine otherwise.

Probably makes sense Swiss Dutch agree together make investments, share results either turns well. larger countries invest more.

It’s request. I’m sure locals gonna give finger. least hope Alaskans goods cross border *everyday*. must destroy entire generation name few. immoral book.

And death rate lower EU summer throughout pandemic good margin.  border closure dictated largely fact neibouring country hasn’t gotten numbers control pandemic account large amount tourism.

Hopefully get too, sooner later don’t think anyone’s infected post vaccination. type clots. charge that’s decision you’d make? would say families I’m curious? Sorry asking make sacrifice even though soldiers?

It’s wrong. save lives save, every single time. That’s what’s right. correct answer. think ""until over"" implies ""until case counts zero"" think making assumptions people believe want rag them.

Yeah, I'll fully vaccinated 8 days. Still gonna wear mask shopping entering restaurant. Why? skin back still 5%~10% chance getting symptomatic COVID, gotta imagine means still risk spreading too. Greatly reduced? Sure, I'll take consider free reduction spread.

I'm also well aware people lie vaccinated, wearing mask vaccinated price pay people. That's fine too. shit never end.... Chris Christie IDK Jersey ever vote another republican matter Murphy lol recommendation time? doubt many people going follow it. 

Maybe time divert unused vaccines Mississippi Michigan thought last sentence pretty clear stood. said ""I'm saying schools stay remote kids vaccinated, saying vaccinating kids major priority."" stand statement, despite votes. post saying vaccinating kids irrelevant. I'm saying irrelevant people deal kids. irrelevant kids either. Students openly discuss vaccines approved 16+ express envy/congratulations older peers get vaccinated. want get sick get families sick either. Ive read fairly often vaccine doesnt stop infection make covid cases heavy disease doenst kill affected people often would vaccinated.
But leads one question : whats point vaccinating doesnt stop infection??? Cases still high whether vaccinated not? allegations There’s old saying Mercedes diesel engines: slow difficult start, starts heats up, there’s stopping afraid wrong. pandemic, everything reasonable even work out. Stop worrying career worry nation people. terrible governor lots people think hit somewhere 60-80% vaccinated, magical herd immunity achievement unlocked point covid cases, deaths, scary articles.

New York City subway daily riders entire nation New Zealand. Cuomo wiggle room since job safe till next year, reinstate tougher public health measures sees need it. FDA approval literally important step process. good vaccine isn’t FDA approved? Well said. also think punish perpetuators conspiracies vaccine COVID-related topics.  
Fake gurus pushing ridiculous 'essays' FB, Telegram Youtube ""how goverment fuels fake pandamic seize power"" ""how goverment wants kill people microchips dangerous vaccines"". 
That's free speech, fueling unreasonable doubts impressional minds ""just want stop"" look kind argument. position power would really rule 400 acceptable reopen early? That’s pretty cold. really say thankful people running things agree way thinking erred side saving lives save instead... numbers manageable - say there’s real risk hospitals overwhelmed. check UK’s Covid cases past month, haven’t already. They’re starting follow Israel’s dramatic drop, looks like might achieved herd immunity point (assuming vaccination rates continue).

And hopefully US weeks behind most. well last time really complained two great wars, yeah. boss fence, told there's chance may able travel without proof vaccination, got it. think businesses/industries say require proof vaccination, better, IMO (even though know never likely happen, organizing ""vaccination passports"" would nightmare) think anyone worried. 

I'm worried getting car accident everyday.  printed something like 25% money last 13 months. growth gdp growth government spending. complaining. screens Apple. I'm anticipating complete tech breakdown within 14 days second shot - way Bill lets slide. lucky got text Ford Field past Monday. Got text Meijer. got first pfizzy hour ago.

Yeah saw too! private doctors allowed vaccinate since week. that, could get vaccinated ""Impfzentren"" (vaccination centers, basically) Remember CDC also makes recommendations like eat raw cookies dough eat well done steak. mean social end pandemic (likely happening US next months) epidemiological end pandemic (that might never happen). Yay! get J&amp;J Tuesday! Can’t wait!!! Maybe. need get customs, get minor rural cities (either fly tiny airplane, rent car drive hours) Around major airports find vaccine appointments hard get. get rural areas free time slots, less picky checking ID whatever give vaccines get them. Different states different rules, state, get vaccine site give one. Wow American something right every again. One, governors (not Whitmer) burned credibility “two weeks” nonsense last year. mean much longer everyone knows it.

This time knew next nothing virus. know spread effective testing. think governors deliberately lied onset pandemic. think simply idea long would last much would spread. difference multiple effective vaccines market federal, state, local governments spending considerable resources get many arms possible. question reach heard immunity. questions when. several good reasons would want slow spread infection right now, important want limit possibility variants arise vaccines might work against. happens, could prolong pandemic indefinitely, one Two, lockdowns didn’t work first time, huge toll people economy. would everyone again?

Michigan many states enacted lockdowns able flatten curve. Cases began going restrictions Three, there’s evidence variant deadly.

Yes, evidence variant deadly.[ ""The B117 COVID-19 variant, first identified United Kingdom October 2020, may pose 61% higher risk 28-day mortality, according study published today  know, sense urgency probably reason want close anyhow.

I really hope doesn’t turn yearly shot, sure again. China going rolling lockdowns mask mandates till 2029 can't wait get final shot next week join fully vaccinated crowd. Seriously, people can't give US credit. tf ""hoarding""? Maybe infrastructure set mass produce vaccines? Ever thought that? Hungary enters chat Reallocate vaccines based usage immediate need instead population. states use excess shots. way, reach herd immunity vaccination infection. choice make. Expectations pure propaganda deflect criticism? 3 weeks ago  data shows decreases months? Data far shown strong protection long measure it. indication protection last months.

I hate say may take closer 4-6 weeks cases fall low levels. forget, zero liability something happens you.

Parents don’t see point complaining it’s like teacher anything sucky online is, obviously trying best.

Online schools created unique subset kids works well for, it’s minority source 1? US. problem Brazil miserable vaccination rate. Maybe, maybe not. speculating. We'll full crowd games Budapest European Championship. Hungary almost 30%

By end April targetting 40%, end May 60%. $1/£1 million, however write out, nothing days. Nobel Prize winner gets $1M. globalized country could find couch. Ineptitude stupidity happened. I've managed snag 2 appointments April 15th, California opens 16+. One J&amp;J, one Moderna. 

I originally wanted J&amp;J hate needles want done faster, dad trying convince get Moderna greater potential booster shots. knows J&amp;J comparable effectiveness weeks out, tested harder circumstances, hes riding variant fear train pretty hard.

I'm still leaning towards J&amp;J. I'm earlier 30s, fit, WFH. need best best. argument merit? Also mRNA vaccines looked superior required international travel something? Ugh, want done. Send cities co-worker(sitting 2 meters me) got tested positive. office whole week.

That's hookworm *would* say. /s Link data Pfizer?

After 2 weeks, Moderna Pfizer 80% immunity first shot. little belief isn’t like upwards moving graph immunity 2 weeks Canada appears pretty well. They're sitting #5 vaccination list pretty impressive country production! got literally 15 minutes ago. actual injection didn’t hurt all. far feel normal. I’m scared get extreme soreness I’m going vacation right lol. $90B number get total cost Flu. That's lost productivity, direct medical care, whole nine yards.

Take divide 30 (about many weeks flu season) 150M (size us workforce) get $20. cost test cost lost labor getting test, think could pull off.

Particularly since going stop cases flu. We'll saving portion $90B.

Would better make flu vaccines mandatory. remind anti vaxxers following movement pushed mainstream playboy model.

Make feel extra dumb trusting someone effectively Hugh Hefner’s boner machine scientists. 3 months wait, 0% protection COVID.

That’s true don’t wear mask socially distance. Lol. Give take. definition herd immunity incorrect. Herd immunity almost zero transmission zero restrictions - masks, social distancing, closures capacity restrictions. relying restrictions, don’t herd immunity. Lady fucking psychotic. relatives Florida, imagine pretty much every conversation vaccines turns discussion government injecting microchips people control them.


And isn’t joke. first shot critical, Canada we're focusing getting everyone first shot fast possible. expect ""full"" second shot vaccination fall. case would probably take AstroZenca. thinking like US right now, good chance getting vaccines market. stupid. state set site doses administer. They're also ones distributing points distribution. I'm sure handle scheduling locations well make easy everyone.

We really blundered parts rollout...  That's America wrote _fat_ checks pre-purchased vaccines even development. Trump vile man gambled least one vaccines would work correctly judged even $10 Billion spent vaccines would less expensive economic destruction COVID causing.

The EU could done well decided stingy. can't speak variants vaccine, J&amp;J vaccine sheet got dose specifically said counter NSAIDs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, etc) used treat mild vaccine side effects. want hug mascot  True normally matter since 100% free. I'd curious see many empty US normal year. Send doses California!  Sounds like good reason take shotgun approach fund bunch different options hope least one comes through.

In times uncertainty, sometimes bites apple best way set success, given dollar figures we're talking downside tiny national budget level.

Sounds like governments picked absolute dumbest time place possible start pinching pennies. reasons deaths (ideally) much proportionate. goes much much - “not above”, significantly *below* proportionate.

Sure, various factors, healthcare workers hopefully taking safety protocols seriously general public, fact remains given 570k deaths US, 3.6k deaths major industry employs 5% entire population extremely (relatively) low.  leads one question : whats point vaccinating doesnt stop infection???

You answered make covid cases heavy disease doenst kill affected people often would vaccinated

There's also evidence vaccines reduce spread, countries high vaccination rates seeing case counts drop dramatically.

We might ever get zero cases, get point there's real threat hospitals overloaded go stadium whatever (and even reasonable expectation thing generating zero covid related hospitalizations). diseases majority population vaccinated still circulate around (Measles Chicken Pox come mind), part normal day day thing without worrying them.

Given stuff health authorities saying numerous studies vaccine effectiveness - particularly mRNA vaccines seem still provide strong immunity variants - really look like we're going better large number people vaccinated. question vaccinations pregnancy. I’m strongly pro-vaccine received first shot, wife currently 4 months pregnant currently holding receiving it. works home otherwise putting unnecessary situations would put higher risk contracting covid. definitely want get point go things used confusing trying get solid answer, know it’s due concrete data available yet. talked dr’s, well pregnant friends relayed experiences dr’s received mixed advice favor waiting favor getting ASAP. guess question is, worst case scenario could realistically get Dr tell pregnant woman wait? White House. I'm sure virologists epidemiologists across country agree too. political opinion, epidemiological reality.  order made, yet. almost certainly come. Correct. flew see long term girlfriend twice (Canada US). also quarantined two weeks time. click ""Checkout"" Surface laptops shopping cart! look problem them. would know one events? Would happen instantly days/weeks jab?  y'all finally send us vaccine doses since giving teenagers point? Expiring AstraZenaca doses count. Great thats thought. According map, Slovakia also approved Sputnik. didnt though, shove number ass. Since 19 blood clot deaths UK 20 million doses administered, say Astrazeneca 99.9996% effective blood clots 2 weeks jabs.

My wife got Monday. problems all. Well exactly 450 close enough, wasted human error point. happy EU learned lesson vaccinations people. county 30% positivity. massive spread within district. lost PreK, one teach. pausing face face...in week, PSAT, ACT, MSTEP testing complete. getting positivity updates exposure notifications three-four times day. bad. They’ll get inoculated...just old fashioned way. yet. getting there, still ways go. Like filing taxes, ""I gotten around yet,"" going go casual procrastination reckless endangerment social circles soon. always prospector coot anti-vax minivan driver - statistically irrelevant.

Do base faith humanity merits biggest idiot konw. district judge would block law mandating vaccine approved FDA faster type injunction.

Dictator  still much lower US numbers adjusted population? arguably greater risk Russian physician near Alexei Navalny someone getting vaccine. 600? need game. I’m feeling better seeing others reply’s. Hoping page you! That's unfortunately stopping people Berlin. Overall numbers pretty flat pleateau, individual areas numbers slightly increasing going fast expected vaccines.

One example (based state statistics), Virginia hosptialization still higher last summer. younger people less effected, treatment options better understood, older populations vaccinated essential workers vaccinated.

It really brings questions hosptializations (not cases) coming from.

It's news job question this. People cautious. Could still lag statistics, better remain cautious right yet.

I still question many cases hosptializations coming from, even news less surface spread high amount vaccinations older people. understand cases increased testing schools wonder hosptializations. 

Deaths quite bit guess could explained caution hosptialzing people earlier. 

Something 100% news covered well entire time, times locations like new york full begining pandemic, albeit increase fear caution. don’t want either. I’d rather Pfizer Moderna suspect US whole plateau 70-80% vaccination rate, may enough herd immunity. However, evenly distributed think practice states counties remain significantly mark leading pockets wherein virus continue circulate. Eradication practical. living COVID rest lives. Offering safe, effective, free vaccine simply capable doing. Kind pointless vaccinate kids covid... I’ll take covid vax turn comes you’re going vax heathy child little experiment big profits... Predictable. buying one Restricting people going store buy things necessary survival would part ""lockdown"" think. point keep people going unnecessarily, nothing stopped getting seeds, paint, furniture delivered home vaccinate anyways?

Thanks details part solution! dumb always think doable island, like water deterrent. Vietnam island. Thanks announcement bed sheets also isolate get covid.

Unless teacher isn’t virtual. daycare workers. work retail. work restaurant. doctor. nurse. dentists. physical therapist.

Or one 10,000 jobs isolation impossible. PPE, also figuring out, institutionally, done reduce risks health care workers. recall big hospital Boston high rates infection among staff early 2020, started making everyone entering hospital -- patients particular, also visitors -- wear surgical mask. institutional move dramatically cut hospital infections without using high quality PPE supply.

I think December, vaccines came out, US, in-hospital transmission virus close zero. Yes, still anxiety among health care workers safety dealing COVID patients, risk fairly well managed better protocols PPE supply end year. health care worker infections occurred outside hospital eating lunch break room. 1. SA variant literally escape mRNA-induced immunity. mRNA vaccines also appear effective SA variant. things true. Immune escape on/off switch.

2. world getting mRNA vaccine. US 1,000 deaths Covid yesterday. small fire? acceptable number deaths?

Canada 38. world US sending vaccines Canada? Excellent point. important keep mind listen statements CDC. first dose, nothing typical flu shot me. article appalling. Four **how many**? 

Russia delivered 13m vaccines far, although know mix Sputnik v others. live place don’t need drive 6 hours Microcenter, middle nowhere must perks though like lockdown, sucks want something binge drinking

Wisconsin hardly would refer “political hotbed” Washington even vaccinating anyone 65 late next week. insane. soreness kicks hours later Uhm Brazil 200 mil ppl. numbers nothing Thank god charge vaccination program then. really give damn anyone themselves, online interactions types indication... think variants going matter much drive case numbers really low. would guess probably changing vaccine much, influenza. Due minor reaction first shot, told take ibuprofen Benadryl morning second appointment, doubt make huge difference. fair monitor investigate irregularities

Absolutely, that's problem here. problem people seeing headlines like influence decision get vaccinated. Small stories snowball completely control spread people know interpret data. Idk, feel like using vaccine help country one highest death tolls virus makes sense giving additional doses around world. maybe that’s me. Giving vaccines Americans die access seems like bad way go Nice! I’m 28 like somewhat healthy tested 20 times don’t believe ever covid. Heard makes worse may it. knows!

Herd immunity, definition, implies cases go zero eventually. herd immunity eventually cases hit zero, otherwise herd immunity. can't herd immunity virus endemic, that's thing.

We benefit herd immunity-type effects, spread lower people immune, that's we're going for. We're already feeling right now, cases deaths dropping quite low we're feeling impact immunity. effect continue become stronger, likely never actually hit full herd immunity. need lockdowns now? No, need get vaccines peoples' arms fast humanly possible literally nothing else priority. 

Michigan track higher peak first wave even could vaccinate rest state’s population instantly, would take well month everyone immune. Michigan absolutely needs take suppressive measures immediately, CDC expressly told them. Texas something right.  comment painfully stupid: Germany developed vaccine democratic socialists workers rights baked every German company unions mandatory unions get representatives every board.

So answer question; best country world vaccine literally socialist got second Moderna shot! 🤙 Yeah make sure got N95 travel way. Surely seven day average 67,000+ daily cases 800+ deaths still concern. rate US could hit 600,000 deaths end month. Relax fine. Keep going! MEAN MOD! Even true, it’s — dick. Tell keep opinions vaccines himself. Great theyll able go back school time September Yeah info yet when, much often booster need yet. timeline somewhere? news articles could find results announcement last week, say they'll file ""soon"".  second Pfizer shot - honestly feeling like it’s bit like start allergy season. arm sore, bad I’m little bit achy. absolutely mental it? idea social distancing worth forever. absolutely fucking decimated mental health around world but, eh, hey least we're healthy right?

I'm done this. I'm done this. refused reinstitute restrictions. I’m hour 24, wouldn’t say feel hellish, poor enough accomplish activity. poor compared usual active self. medical advice, course, there's nothing CDC guidelines indicating cold seasonal allergies whatever contraindication receiving vaccine. Whether vaccination clinic allows come cold separate matter, CDC suggest medical reason get second dose. Picking milk eggs? get vaccine it? Already one? another? fine 2/3weeks ago got it. There's pretty good description risk couple days ago hint J&amp;J vaccine reviews. Less 1 250,000 would experience side effect. 
 
_____
The unusual, sometimes fatal, conditions documented least 86 instances, 18 fatal, March 22, European Medicines Agency said statement. across 25 million people who’ve vaccinated AstraZeneca jab, meaning condition, data reported far, seems occur fewer one person every 250,000 vaccinated. kind rare side effects unlikely picked even large-scale clinical trials. 

Meanwhile, EU mandating AstraZeneca carry additional tests try determine exact cause rare blood clots risk factors may predispose people developing condition. EMA asking two European universities carry studies look risk factors clotting conditions. 

The two rare conditions—cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), involves blood clots veins leading brain, splanchnic vein thrombosis, involving clots abdominal veins—were accompanied low levels blood platelets sometimes bleeding, EMA said.

It said conditions seemed occur mostly women younger 60, within two weeks receiving first dose vaccine. said cause condition unclear might related immune response vaccine induces.

European medical experts said possible blood clotting could related technology underpins AstraZeneca’s vaccine. uses modified chimpanzee virus, adenovirus, carry instructions body’s cells make spike protein associated coronavirus, turn prompts immune response. Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine also uses adenovirus, European officials said hints J&amp;J clinical trials, people also developed blood clots, clotting might emerge potential side effect vaccine too. said number cases J&amp;J clinical trials make clear connection time. feel like everyone always forgets people 16 years old can’t get vaccine yet. guess that’s people without kids people think kids risk.  American covid deaths dropping slowly? Even country (Sweden) completely botched rollout seen larger drop deaths US. cases increasing ton.

I don’t mean slam US clearly done better job have, find curious vaccinations yet take massive effect. worse uptake among elderly doses spread evenly among different age groups? Odd, could order seeds online contact pickup. want home daughter, ruined productivity. Watching 3 (now 4) year old wife worked home exercise futility. led terrible work terrible parenting. wife high school teacher staff university, we've back office since August 2020 daughter back pre-school person whole time. months worked home nightmare.

That said, I'd much welcome hybrid model pandemic subsides. Working home days kid still school would nice. job requires onsite lot every day.

While instant reaction working home awful, world everyone home 24/7, becomes attractive. vaccine passport bullshit ? 

How else safe international travel without ? see lot folks reddit basically ready hole forever they're absolutely terrified virus.

I mean, get it, want either (hence got vaccinated.) jeez, people, gotta accept never going away. Iirc takes 4-5 weeks since filing get approval another one get applied could seeing 12-15 getting vaxed late may! dumbass instituting restrictions using allotment already have. cdc asked directing reinstitute restrictions refused. would prefer curve worse? Currently experiencing right now. still feel like hell 28 hours later. Hi, first -- congratulations! That's exciting news!

From medical perspective, really realistic ""worst case scenario"" would cause doctor cautious recommending vaccine point. physicians simply much conservative recommendations others make recommendation unless lot study topic particular; others willing consider balance evidence whole draw reasonable conclusions recommendations. Neither approach inherently wrong, per se, although certainly know stand spectrum.

I can't speculate exactly doctors recommending wife wait thinking, know wife's medical history, tell CDC relevant medical societies (American College Obstetricians Gynecologists, Society Maternal-Fetal Medicine, American Academy Pediatrics, etc.) feel comfortable saying balance evidence supports vaccinating pregnant women want vaccine.

Until post-marketing studies and/or pregnant woman studies completed, going hard formally nail recommendation given... would recommend pregnant women allowed receive vaccine unless confident would safe effective.

I know that's satisfying answer, hope helps! Yeah I’m wondering environment apparently lot open vaccines general black population. Maybe it’s religious thing, family &amp; friends much religious. Actually, think real powerhorse vaccinate majority world even finished trials yet. probably adenovirus vector mRNA vaccine. based old fashioned *cheap* technology growing viruses chicken eggs. way flu vaccine made. nervous Johnson Johnson blood clotting? got mine days ago nervous it. don’t know look timeline would shot pop Unfortunately young guys get hired start adopt guys ideals, look skill opportunity learn them.

Slowly surely young guys start parrot uninformed BS spout. Shitty people shitty, pandemic not. lot gloating holier-than-thou attitudes toward US earlier on, (Canada's) return normalcy also depend getting better handle virus. Idk anyone would gloat people dying higher rates elsewhere. I'm happy many people want vaccinated. family got first shots us eligible. younger brother person house young get vaccinated yet. I'm looking forward able get semblance normal back Johnson &amp; Johnson delivering fewer vaccine doses next week, Zients say many although insisted company expects able deliver 8 million doses per week end April. 

Atleast still keeping goals. People felt side effects 2nd dose moderna, long last?

So, long think Brazilians wait “done”? Lol parties issue goes back 1980s started chopping crown corporations including one researched vaccines. PCs responsible Liberals Conservatives. Go us! That's way generous.

The amounts money talking trivial relative national budgets. No. Luckily coronaviruses mutate nearly quickly influenza viruses do, *hopefully* need yearly boosters. imagine we'll need one currently existing variants, even pretty well covered current vaccines. Generally, going long helps second dose hit better. Since vaccines disease, think sweet spot would around time. However, looked it. random vaccinations I've gotten (anthrax, hepatitis, ebola, dengue) time shots around 3 months.

*Just looked hepatitis least one month, least two month wait, since there's three shots.*

Honestly, people probably getting antibodies cranked three weeks, damn, that's short amount time. grandma horrible day getting second shot 3 weeks, needs pushed back.

You'll know defenses start feeling medium horrible three hours second shot. But, wasted even feel crappy.

As fun thing do, get two flu shots season 4 months apart. see strong defenses body totally freaks seeing exact thing warned about. bad day, full two days anything. Lockdowns bringing 100-150 million people worldwide. wouldn’t be? This. Bigger economies means less risk spending R&amp;D. US spent something like $9B last summer spread among 7 different companies.

You can't confidently say cases dropped 50% vaccination X country country different cultural environment. 


That said, possible 50-60% vaccination produce massive reduction cases particular country. Curevac produced Europe sister get flu shot keep insurance work.

To them, grand slam *Covid0*. Even still spread covid hospitals manageable, even new variants pop vaccines manage still keep us hospitals (which evidence suggests case) - isn’t perfect Public Health scenario. isn’t Public Health Grand Slam.

Sadly 20% 0.05% population (India) already achieved 20% one shot given.. ass 2 months, effects still place year later, though much reduced. I'm 29 healthy. thing indifferent--drives crazy people view bug. Israel declared herd immunity couple days ago, vaccines approved people 16. Also exactly UK government did, except delivering part- Actually, I'm worried math.

I'm sure ""stops hospitalization"", understanding lower % hospitalization.

But overall target reopen country, lower efficacy vaccine... math scares going end higher number (not %) hospitalizations: country reopens vaccine lower efficacy, larger number cases anyway.

The vaccine needs stops transmission max possible cases. guess herd immunity require larger portion people vaccinated vaccine lower efficacy. 1.8 billion???

Twice population EU??? 15% France, going well ! curfew restaurants NYC got reinstated May... Yup, design. Thanks, Gates. benevolent capitalist! Exactly correct. definitely going endemic.

However, I've called it, told despite Novavax's announcements crossover, facility study received nothing Novavax (No guidance, instructions, etc., -- importantly, guess -- product inject anyone with). yesterday afternoon (April 8). thought coronavirus vaccine sub, find similar threads UK forum people saying they've already received first crossover shot (or scheduled get it).

I also started receiving texts last week I'm able register vaccine shot. I'd like stay study personal gain (getting vaccine think better two already market) since would help data presume people stay study. However, cannot find info people see maybe locations getting crossover shot, might able get it, etc. -- basically, credible way figure like week's wait, I'm looking late May something.

Kind rambling, basically: anyone Novavax study US getting crossover sees this? anyone know I've told? Yeah, I’ve definitely hungover several times since getting vax’d couple weeks ago. Hopefully symptoms eventually go away. No, that’s immunity works. immune system learns foreign invaders “look like” deal appropriately whenever comes back contact them. 

Remember, we’re bombarded pathogens constantly. notice “the big stuff” makes us sick, immune system raising big response deal it. bodies pretty dang resilient. boris wanted us It’s victim blaming. 

It’s giving path forward.

Those seem really relevant discussion here.

Someone skips today, means tomorrow two days later, open another appointment. We're weeds terms much longer causes thing keep going think. hardly say EU diplomatic start. UK government pretty restrained response. British tabloids scum, since vaccine rollout started hardly felt like day gone without EU finger pointing struggling rollout. much everyone says aimed AZ UK, funny narrative eventually turned UK hoarding 'stealing' EU vaccines.

Got first Pfizer shot Google says 74 million kids (below 18) US. *all* got infected, 1,480 would die. definitely ideal, overall it’s pretty negligible amount kids don’t think many people would agree justifies lockdown, especially adults vaccinated community transmission greatly reduced eliminated. risk 1 100,000 according highest estimate, almost exactly odds anaphylactic allergic reaction one mRNA's (11 1 million). used get lot scary stories news allergic reactions, hear anymore, reason - rare serious concern.

People delayed-onset local reaction (e.g., erythema, induration, pruritus) around injection site area first vaccine dose contraindication precaution second dose. individuals receive second dose using vaccine product first dose recommended interval, preferably opposite arm.

It’s one things ideally get checked rule anything serious, you’re right that’s known side effect. Though quote CDC points — that’s is, nothing worry about!

Two weeks now, doubt vaccination numbers high resurgence. also isolate get covid. like choices astrazenica covid. third option keep weve past year.

Now ill take chance vaccine see people might wanna wait Yeah, rural communities going get slammed summer. us probably busy living best lives notice, almost inevitable point. That’s Canada UK. Get many 1st doses possible delay 2nd dose til everyone possible Middle night/early morning. fine next day asshole toddler accidentally punched shoulder idea grim stateside;

Literally lmao. shithole live in? Life normal Wisconsin. even lockdown. We’ve long past point. that, within states keep allocating vaccines areas low uptake (usually rural) vaccines needed already high uptake (usually urban) areas, finding appt difficult. 

This enormous public health failure. People dying this. think weird people would believe safe long term despite evidence.

Because general rule vaccines bad side effects almost exclusively first couple months vaccination. general rule transcends vaccine *type* too. basically everything. Yes, mRNA vaccines new type, yes could exception rule, *zero* evidence. statistical body work going back decades gives us good *probability* long term side effects. Also worth noting one key elements makes mRNA vaccines attractive theoretical safety they're specific train bodies. vaccine types theoretically would potential side effects kind using blunt instrument train body. Again, *proof* long term problems vaccines, lot circumstantial pieces evidence holding view. 1.8bn doses 

900m orders, option 900m
