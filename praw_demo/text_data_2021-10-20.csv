Unfortunately, trend admissions worrying. Belgian hospitals recorded admission 130 new patients Covid 24 hours, new record 5 months sets average 88 daily hospitalisations, 53% previous week.

But importantly, comparing figures one day day previous week, increase growing every day, sign exponential phenomenon. 130 admissions 80% figures recorded previous Thursday (and corresponding fact entries Tuesday). reproduction rate, based evolution admissions, reaches 1.33. soon exceeds 1, sign epidemic progressing.

The number beds occupied patients Covid approaching 1000, 240 intensive care, jump 27% 19% respectively.

After first vaccine around 20-30min later felt like body froze weird vision seemed like body would shut smth like that, hazy vision. lasted 15seconds thats it.

Now second jab around 1 month similiar hazy vision second part day last week so, walking seems weird. balance, lightning.

I'll still follow whatever public rules are, I'm left wondering end game is. point vaccines widely available, need move on. live Washington State restrictions always seems.

I don’t want 2nd grade kid wearing mask rest school career. hasn’t normal year schooling, actually seeing peoples faces years going impact long term?

Im supportive vaccine mandates mask removal approval 5 up. wouldn’t go far. initial numbers certainly lies. established used algorithm reported according numbers. actually think kids wear masks school. reduction common respretory infection beneficial everyone, especially children.  always thought China lying low case numbers. guess actually report outbreaks maybe numbers relatively accurate. businesses started charging additional health insurance premiums employees vaccinated. going become expensive get shot.  country, totally decline pill, hey, live medieval era. Slippery slope. choose trust immune systems fight home. won't. basically line initial vaccination level efficacy.

No, much better that. Initial vaccine efficacy something like ~95% *compared unvaccinated people*. booster ~95% efficacy *compared people vaccinated 11 months ago*. People vaccinated 11 months ago obviously still level protection compared unvaccinated people, reasonably infer protection (vaccine + booster) greater ~95% compared totally unvaccinated people.  We’re going quickly hit point we’re vaccinated (overall) we’re gonna get. 

Once happens, people facing real risk choose themselves. things start getting hand (e.g. start clogging ICUs) restrict activities, ours. last years shown Americans utter morons, kind nuance lost them. understand he's coming ""too confusing"" aspect. Endemic: (a disease) regularly found among particular people certain area.

Pandemic: widespread occurrence infectious disease whole country world particular time.

I think fine still describing current situation pandemic. recede endemic deaths: causes stabilizes near 5-year averages. long significantly notably affecting global health retain notable designation. would test vaccinated odds catching spreading low? manage pass another vaccinated person little chance person end sick dead. That's waste resources. logic tested MMR, DTaP, etc. regular basis there's chance someone, somewhere caught even though they're vaccinated. Yes, correct. far combination highest protection, also side effects believe second dose Moderna around 10x risk Myocarditis compared second dose Pfizer. also conducted study based around 400 healthy people FDA voted general population 16/2, CDC 9/6. enough actual data now. think Walensky want wait find necessary overruled advisory panels winter coming obvious vaccines effectiveness waning quickly.  84% effectiveness symptomatic infection incredible. Why? Thinking Moderna Also everyone would get vaccinated ICUs around country filling severe covid cases. Looking greedy capitalistic point view, someone footing bill this, I'd wager fair number businesses going take huge hit insurance premiums unvaccinated people needing ICU levels care. strange sort of...stopped? felt rather crappy day vaccine, dinner time, felt better. Shouldnt vacinated tested well? meant snarky comment 🙄 live Portugal, people vacinated people still get sick die even vacine, means vacinated tested well reason regular testing also? I'd like know protection asymptomatic infection well   true, wonder late point. medical professionals laughing right now. turns endemic enough people communitt immunity it. Delta- pretty much everyone going get point. Different areas different phases, though. would individual communities need announce it? That’s guidelines CDC laid out, anywhere dropped mandate summer added back fall response CDC guidelines. percentage submitted bullshit religious exemption requests forged oh-so-secure vaccination cards? True, it’s kind like partying hard, smoking 20s 30s, living life max, dealing fallout decisions 40s plus. “fun” decades always better “consequence” decades. Bottom line, life sucks die. true. CDC kind become joke point. open mouths things get worse. like run announcements QC make sure respected. 

Announcements like immediately anybody hesitant vaccine questioning point is. nightmares that, COVID.  Think way. everyone vaccinated significance Covid would vastly diminished. Hospitalizations deaths low would statistically nearly indistinguishable pre-Covid normal. Yes, still shared infections. practical purposes pandemic would new normal would much like old normal.

Refusers primary obstacle achieving state. keep pandemic alive. Nice they're shit fan eventually. see sliding scale risk vs cost.

I get mask, high risk scenarios (like pandemic!) it’s important, hate masks. can’t hear people well. It’s harder read peoples expressions. much human interaction lost.

While real benefits wearing mask, think comes point wearing generally weighs cost. think approaching point. kids ability get vaccinated, still mask mandates, logical end date ever ending mask mandates, COVID almost certainly endemic now. way live. I'm inferring then, someone received inoculations signs two-shot Moderna sequence receive 100 100?   legally closer states independent UN members.  So, means vacinated ones, can't sick infecting others? vacine got 100%efective preventing infection infecting others?!

It 100% effective everyone gets it. Pertussis vaccines 80-90% effective measles vaccines 97% effective, hear massive outbreaks disease except community low vaccination rates. Measles several times contagious COVID too. good incentive get shot. Maybe middle ground lockdown ""Screw everyone else. care anymore. I'm going pretend pandemic over."" Good point, believe Pfizer booster still 30 mcg. Studies indicate mixing vaccines produces higher antibody levels, Moderna still higher dosage, feel would great option too, like boosters. !RemindMe 1 year Probably stop 1,500+ deaths per day. You’re mean one, like know seen anti-vaccine talking point true. COVID going away, trust vaccine now, obviously never need start accommodating rest us believe science. Wear n95 respirator goggles every time leave house, stop going public places, whatever, lets let regular people get back normal life.  high community spread right now. still get vaxxed masking helps prevent it. want done mean over. first H1N1 human flu pandemic, partially deadly. Testing makes sense. Even test every morning come work, get infected infect people test shows positive. think halo effect huge amounts antibodies shots gone now, COVID still infect pretty bad. Third shots happen. mind, hurt they're free. Imagine vaccinated fearing safety walk fast food restaurant. think there's merit ""fear mongering"" shit keeps getting regurgitated. like scout patch achievement award right.

It's absurd.

And know absurd. That's point. want option unvaxed absurd, unreasonable option. way everyone either gets vaxed leaves.

That's goal. want absurd. believe find better ways treating though new meds lead less deaths. Let's positive!!! thought influenza viruses actually mutate 10x fast coronaviruses, that's Spanish flu ended eventually mutating something contagious (so dominant) less deadly, crisis went away.

Which leads conclude someone decided Pfizer vaccine good vulnerable people least 6 months, possibly longer. haha 1 year old account. CDC/FDA say get one, see reason to. It’s truly “such short span time”; hundreds millions people already taken 2 COVID vaccines within much shorter span. 

I Pfizer haven’t gotten booster yet, though know technically could ask get one. when/if CDC recommends age bracket, I’ll there. debating mixing got 2 doses Pfizer already. leaning towards Pfizer booster available. something different likely change vaccine efficacy due initial viral replication counts memory based immune response, b cells tcells, get check, barring weird effects mutations.  flu annual epidemic. assume true rhinovirus. may endemic waves, waves not. epidemic endemic? case dichotomy pandemic/epidemic endemic false? True, I'm even sure enough data definitely say infectious.

In either case make difference flat numbers explosion we're seeing Eastern Europe right now. estimated 10% growth advantage. It'll less impact Alpha Delta had. 

In long run might become dominant UK countries though. 

Those two statements mutually exclusive Pussies. Fire all! Yeah. I’m I’d working weekends get thing approved. FDA folks presumably kids also. Hoping delay due seriousness safety protocols. link? thought one benefit J&amp;J mRNA longer/better T-cell response. could wrong, though. One things like other. Also, *polyp.  college towns may liberal, students come state necessarily liberal. Y'all'dn't  
I understand strong opinion politics behind handling pandemic. keep discussion focused There’s conflicting data arguments. don’t surely know, neither I.

Conflicting data efficacy vaccines? Vaccines proven reduce infection, severe illness, transmission. That's major goal behind vaccination. conflicting data there? 

Note: Side effects caused vaccine discredit effectiveness vaccine. malfunctioned counter argument defaulted “just wear mask” lol Link?  should, unvaccinated get sick, may days/weeks. get hospitalized worse, long Covid can’t work. infect coworkers also get sick can’t work. hand food? mean need selfish reason care, is. happens complaining “nobody wants work anymore!” won’t help get max convenience life back.  unvaccinated pandemic like going around constantly swinging fists. course, free human beings right whatever please fists - except freedom flail around like maniacs ends guy's nose begins. Would want someone goes around constantly punching people face punished it?  flu, still considered annual seasonal epidemic, would endemic epidemic seasons? imagine fast food restaurants check government ids? Like chipotle checking someone actually 21 order beer. Unfortunately won’t know booster tacks another year immunity lasts much longer.  drinking burger lunch. often fast food place refuse service. Completely unrelated comparison. Boosters pretty effective preventing cases Delta (at least short-term). AY4.2 prove significantly better Delta, we'll need see studies boosters specifically AY4.2 expect booster released. 

Nasal vaccine boosters boost secretory antibodies could big boost well, could long-term goal rather something get near future. Vaccination 5-12 year olds would help boost total vaccination rate. 

Still, looking Belgium whole, cases nowhere near previous peak. We'll see current wave goes, plateaus soon still would March-April wave. terms deaths, they're still way March-April wave. 

Has Belgium started boosting 65+ year olds? think piece variant concern going bit pain health organizations figure out. 

It Delta, couple mutations. Delta variants variants concern, since Delta variant concern. 

So far really decide VoC sublineages deserve fancy VoC title, since Delta already clear winner time old VoCs started developing fit sublineages. 

This sublineage expected small growth advantage Delta, would doubt gets VoC title unless find somehow something particular different regular Delta. Let's keep things simple (even judging things): ""So what?"" kidding me?...  government do? public support covid restrictions. people want get lives. vaccines soon approved 5-11 age range well. really closing borders protect anti vaxxers? Use whatever want. lot jurisdictions data equivalent zip code. NIH study data showed. Many countries, including UK, highly vaccinated seeing another surge. (we tend follow 6 weeks behind UK) also bunch countries, including Russia, minimally vaccinated, virus spreading rampantly and, undoubtedly, going result variants.

Not sure we've cleared storm. sounds like antibody levels plenty high done. Others said done 1 J&amp;J + 2 Moderna though. Note guy, 100% doctor pharmacist. use medical advice. agree lot said. CDC messaging *sucks*. benchmark 100% normal would vaccination opens full population (should happened long ago), booster rollout fixed, unvaccinated either cajoled right thing functionally ostracized economic social activity.

When happens, see finish line. Light end tunnel, etc. lack huge shortcoming pandemic communication. thought smaller dose formulation going dilute adult doses already have.  swear read yesterday variant concern yet unlikely alter course pandemic. irony… Santa Clara county hovering around 90% vaccinated last time checked. seriously don’t think affect many people. links studies regarding mixing Pfizer Moderna booster? 100 50 mcg studies would much appreciated !RemindMe 1 year Maybe “countries” general large collective useful pandemic situations Indeed. ""I totally going it, -- fault!"" I’m sure unpopular opinion honestly hatred anti vaxxers get seems wrong. sympathy covid deniers people don’t confidence get vaccine different. mad people system put misinformation fear place. know amazing people aren’t sure vaccine safe misinformation spread. blame sad state media really wish given protest. also think it’s wrong belittle someone’s intelligence make feel stupid confidence vaccines do. try encouraging accepting, calmly try show get vaccinated. think fact everyone combative pushes people away. I’m sure I’ll downvoted that’s two cents feel like someone benefit reading it. Let’s forget empathy, even little misguided. zero idea talking difference mask compliance amongst Indians significantly high compared US. CDC foolishly prematurely said people stop wearing masks, see lead them. Finland. never really national mask mandate anyway, recommendation. Companies mandates customers course.   Yep. want know need boosters stay fully protected. already got third shot. gladly get every six months necessary. 

It interesting see results longer studies available. Someone bad covid got someone sick. person affected died. person got them
Sick said felt better got negative test. long okay around people risk even general public testing negative 15% lol says right title Mix match here. Got Pfizer Booster yesterday 3PM. Got original J&amp;J back April.

Today 9:30AM, feel fine. Soreness injection site, nowhere near bad JJ shot. Side effects: nearly non-existent. guess concentrate ""feel"" something, guess slight fatigue? nothing would make want curl bed. function perfectly normally feel good spirits. full 24 hours yet maybe I'm woods terms side effects. report back anything changes. 100% agree. odds symptomatic outbreak workplace extremely low everyone vaxxed. I'm pro mask pro vaccine yeah, get 2nd, worry first. IDGAF CDC says. question body adapts even vaccination/infection.

The argument waning immunity needs continual boosting isn’t great one. don’t know it’s pushed hard. suspicions it’s drug said daily, once. 30, go Pfizer less chance developing myocarditis. That's I'm doing. there's herd immunity? simply becomes endemic? Hoping honestly. Schools need right now. I'm fine voluntary places happy required Disney. Amazing fast gets turned religion politics, don’t want force employees (who already get treated badly, make enough put bad situation) enforce law, isn’t job description. understand this, even respect it. said simply religious beliefs, political, it’s far stretch. saying get it. 

I feel bad, people shoot fast food restaurants giving extra sauces, could u imagine forced check medical records? actually feel bad them. hope people don’t take frustrations them. 

The see news watch government makes think want us fighting rather looking direction. sad. bad things happen, neighbors ones help regardless religion are, political side, etc. mean first responders military lean right, yet save anyones life regardless are. 

But people want spread hate blame sides religions. crazy. judge group based actions wrong situations, race, religion, political side, anything.  hope right said thing 2016 certain orange fellow ended f'ing president four long years. remember least Pzifer trials smaller doses age group get misinformation though?

Masks actually sometimes controversial across pond (I'm expat). nearly political among ordinary people. ""this side I'm on"" marker, something people collectively reduce spread there's debate whether that's worth it.

Thus, here, 12+ school children. still require masks stores businesses though, people wear instead going ""grrrrr"" it.  Yes got mine morning! wife hot last Thursday school works at. I'm always little scared come health related things. worry - cost getting health wise lot smaller huge benefit getting it. friend go you? lulwhat?

Sorry can't follow simple thread reasoning. last name Walensky?  Driving social risk. It’s actually decent example shows social risk bear relative social benefit getting places. 

We measure risk socially individually, absolute relative. 

For instance, could literally lock every household gets COVID let necessary businesses continue operate. could bring risk virtually zero. could close schools keep kids home. 

Risk relative though. 

Say keep schools closed: kids lose socialization education. Say keep businesses closed: people lose livelihoods economy shrinks hospitals get worse. 

Have ever heard notion micromort? ""too late"" thing make logical sense. Delta.4.2 15% contagious Delta 5-day serial interval currently 1/1000 prevalence take 250 days overtake Delta - issue winter. 1/100 prevalence importing cases get spring surge it. time effect next month three, prevalence low enough imported cases significant effect total.

But overall 15% large enough cause dramatic surge way previous VOC's did; 25-100% higher rate spread. likely issue future winters, increase rate spread increase chance covid matching exceeding flu annual deaths. !RemindMe 1 year Even climate change cause covid spread, mean can't cause others.

Nice!  booster right? well protected least several months  That’s sad feel way.

Honest question: 

What daily life? stay home often? 

I’d imagine someone lives fear contracting virus immediately deemed lesser intelligence remove it. would say deleted.

People vaccinated community 8 10 residents also vaccinated fearful going public. got covid second time? kind business well? Mask production? Life insurance? Vitamin supplements? Activities people furlough? Thanks. guess mean still risk pregnant women baby, extra cautious around unvaccinated people crowds etc two things:

1. may 'end game'; COVID \*new\* disease, need adapt. new normal, exactly old normal. mean never leave house, though. 
2. time, actual risk diminishes, perceptions risk also diminish. Behavior (and laws/policies) move back towards 'normal'. take time even evaluate risk (as saw May :)

Keep mind \*will\* long-term changes behavior. People lived Great Depression, example, tend(ed?) save more. personal anecdote, perception economic risk changed 2008 recession (and even fired), became risk averse.

Again, mean stay home wearing double mask ... people average want less crowds less indoor activities. Unfortunately, less trust vaccines, authorities general.

BTW, \*you\*, especially US college student, lot freedom change \*your\* behavior ... example, move to, say, Florida Alabama college. State governments US: ""Don't worry guys, lockdowns!

It’s literally first sentence article. attacks part virus little mutation I'd fine masking forever cuts disease. not?   Science created mess, no? still conspiracy theory it’s hard keep up.  know vaccines work.  Believe not, lot states passed anti masking laws [in effort undermine Important note comparison “fully vaccinated”, know group still maintains significant protection. Would interesting see efficacy vs non vaccinated. Wouldn’t surprise like many 3 dose shots approaches 99% Two words.  Freedom Fries It’s politics? It’s science. takes split second determine little politicians know anything, average person average intelligence able recognize separate political beliefs common sense science. 

I mean, Florida’s government fighting vaccine mandate although vaccinated required places employment long time. it’s vaccine killing us? Laughable. 


When comes it, employers don’t give shit you. care saving money. Getting covid landing icu millions dollars? paying that? Employers private insurers don’t want responsible that. Hence mandates. Ya, they're trying save face without actually requiring vaccinations. Plus makes even company's retail store employees, however, subjected daily tests despite consumer-facing jobs  excerpt:

That article received January 8th, booster trials underway January? would ones later take account? immunologists said dose interval contributed Moderna lasting longer close study suggests?

Also; cagey 50 vs 100 boosters? would say unpublished (AFAIK) P201A trial results comparing FDA presentation 50 100 produced least 66fold rise, that's it. Further, explain NIH trial showing significantly better response 50 trials necessarily directly comparable; settle conclusively P201A results? fuck?   think surprised well stuff play significant chunk US population. think he's disgusting person, whole lot people agree him. ""it lasted 2.5 months"" meant study. think meant protection interpret study lasting longer? so, long think study lasted?

So assume try get natural immunity unvaccinated people refusing booster. FYI: Moderna reduced dosage 50 ug booster.   Thanks realistic response. !RemindMe 1 year  Ooh fucking GOOD... STOP ALREADYY!!! VACCINATE FUCK EVERYONE!!! strictly speaking science perspective, adults wear masks adult settings like office workplace?

Because community spread high even vaccinated people need take additional precautions. last question yes. New York City made show drivers license vaccination card. Epic fail BBC - carefully said go year necessary...they say would be...could 2024-2025. course getting downvoted even though completely correct. bare handful counties US red level community spread, means pretty much matter live US recommendation wear mask indoors, vaccinated not.

Anti-vaxxers don’t believe risk there. choosing take risk covid. choosing vaccinate multiple reasons. reasons would call uneducated. might non covid non vaccine related issues like fear injections fear crowds medical personell. might allergic. might believe changes dna (it not) gives B Gates controll using 5G (nope, one isn’t true either). small number younger adults might choose take covid risk without vaccine think young healthy safeguard them. That’s bad selfish reason, sure. people saying don’t believe risk all. graph paper cluster countries low vaccination rates low increases (\~0) cases. took look countries mentioned paper, include:

The virus still improve, mutate, assume infitive spike protein mutations make worse. certain point get soft cap infectious covid be. fuck no. outspoken loud people led charge vaccines, even majority. like population society seems time. I'm fed poor science communication kind.

They need Bill Nye types CDC FDA. People explain lay people what's important know, understandable fashion. risk-averse people parsing every possible word ""technically correct"". Ah yea, fuckin around decades waaaayy better finding ones starting be. guess think hang covid zero Olympics vax rate gets 90s.

Then, course, realize I'm /r/Science I'm seeing thorough, peer reviewed study confirming many people observing. 

I like it, science works.  Thank you. Hey, thinking again. 

I get impression, upon re-reading comments, think [I'm kind antimask antivax ""kids get sick Covid"" idiot. 

You're suggesting 35% infected children require hospitalization, surely. sample kids used study representative kids. 

I'm trying argue kids get sick die Covid, do. lot things less bad death happen kids Covid too. clearly spread virus. 

I'm suggesting sample used study apples apples. So, drawing conclusions well children spread virus using data best do. That's all. Probably don’t want people like anyway. Imho can't forever, would need forever.  smokers, drug users...like I'm things, think able buy anything want to, like cold meds (the ones make meth from) need present ID get them.

&amp;#x200B;

So, want get ounce coke, cigs, little meth walk home, maybe trenbolone stay looking juicy f\*\*k, fine...but can't get drivers licesnse expect EMT waste time convulsing body.

&amp;#x200B;

Freedom. it, all. Pardon ignorance health concern well done fries? burnt side. get mine well done time comment concerned.  teachers stupid fear vaccine live virus. I’ve asked anti-Covidvaxer afraid virus afraid vaccine. logical answers. Eligible. Kids able get shot pretty soon though. Conducting thought experiment think single conclusion. There’s value seeing others understand situation, even think they’re wrong. Lots public still imagines get percent vaccinated we’re this. ignore everywhere high vaccine rates yet still restrictions. locally, countries, keep mental security-blanket fantasy going.

The people finally realize rest life think finally start get new normal palatable. explanation.

For virus kills small fraction infected (like Covid, ~0.2%), almost evolutionary pressure make less deadly, evolutionary pressure make infectious still there.

So happens covid evolves faster viral replication rate, making contagious deadly.

But increased mortality matter much evolutionary standpoint, even Delta carriers die tiny minority. overall, faster replicating virus evolutionary advantage infectious. 

The virus evolve direction lower lethality kills non-negligible fraction carriers, that's case covid.  dint believe mRNA vaccine available here. vaccines old-school style like flu shots. Rollout going steady far know. pretty easy get appointment get vax. large scale mandates point. That's universities unfortunately. work 98% vaccination, state 70% population vaccinated 80% 1 dose, still mask mandate.  science statistics well based saying thread well countless others showing likely heart issue second dosage vaccine. “I never heart palpitations happened right got vaccinated.. I’m sure it’s vaccine though”… like what? Surely can’t dense? actually don’t give af health whatever want body I’m one side mandating jab you’ll lose job who’s side table really infringing health choice? even given *chance* messaging misinterpreted. 

The message right eve pediatric vaccinations simply ""It's here! excited! Vaccines work help get us this!""

Instead f#cking downer going make harder convince parents get kids vaccinated. 

""Why would take risk help still need wear masks?""

Seriously, let moron television first place? really wanted force hand, make pay tests deduction paycheck vaccines available kids- make masks optional. Period end it. can’t go forever. Stop telling child I’ve everything can. I’m done. Flanders 92,5% vaccination among +12 years still see huge increase cases. +50% two weeks now.

As aside, mRNA tech could transform ability make far effective flu vaccine, might hopefully reduce thousands deaths flu everyone ""accepts"" part normal life. Important stat New openings topped pre-pandemic levels Would booster shot still hold time wane quite quickly like original series Pfizer doses? I’m curious allowing mix-and-match, figure Moderna booster might stronger might hold longer like original Moderna series has, I’m completely sure science there. California, 18 sell alcohol liquor store. 21 serve alcohol bar. think 18 serve restaurant. Got J&amp;J early April…excited get booster. Absent supporting data, I’m leaning towards Moderna. data showing efficacy booster option? Yes, going masking based health conditions others? so, masks stay. Nope abandoned strategy: also countries strategy.
Finally, publicztion evaluate elimination strategy: got AZ first, Pfizer second - need booster point, want collect Moderna shot next! Capitalism intimidates people right thing. bit argument doctor last week schedule test possible breakthrough fast enough, left sick boss demanded come next day. know many people died covid. know anyone died vaccine. Statistics vaccine. what, still endemic. It'll drag every years. Yes. Everything I've seen suggests data end year, approvals mean early 2022. vaccine mandate work? vulnerable people working there? It’s office. It’s weird don’t answer here, need still wear mask office everyone access vaccine? state mandate. 

I’m trying draw parallel future state. Masks aren’t going away people, ever. Here’s perfect place require yet they’re still required. ""Vaccine passports"" controversial literally country. hate American. right this. economic cost COVID-19 estimated something like $10 trillion, benefits provided vaccines must trillions already -- absolutely believe Pfizer's profit tiny compared that. Making billion saving world seems reasonable me. *cries pregnant.* Direct outrage refusing get vaccinated tantrum “they” making “us” “masked society” sounds like conspiracy theory bullshit makes sound unhinged. variant H1N1, numerous distinct influenza viruses?  Japan South Korea population acknowledged importance followed masking distancing guidelines. western world decided ""muh freedoms"" important communities. say office workers open floor plan offices — actually worker working open floor plan exposed people indoors.

So many companies ignoring CDC indoor masking guidelines sustained high community transmission areas (nearly entire US). Many businesses allowing employees remove masks open floor plans desk. Seems pretty situationally dependent. think anyone internet speak relative risk profile workplace. amongst unvaccinated. it’s personal choice point, wear masks adult-only places?  faster uncontrolled spread H1N1 meant shitton extra deaths 

In raw numbers believe Covid infected people now, percent population 1918 Pandemic astronomically devastating. 

BUT also mean much greater portion population built natural immunity quickly, slower mutation influenza virus compared current coronavirus means immunity stayed useful much longer.

If hit herd immunity threshold once, virus dies pretty fast. 

But pass finish line, people start losing immunity either due immune system 'forgetting' virus due changes virus make prior immunity ineffective, becomes race moving finish line. McAfee killed  cdc rescinded mask mandate cases deaths skyrocketed. exactly. I'm even facetious. trust science doctors enough get vaccinated want start trusting contracted disease? minimum, hospitals making unvaxxed covid patients absolute bottom priority triage. Figures, got Pfizer booster two days ago. announced yesterday.

But that's fine. I'm still remarkably protected mask inside public. chances getting covid low getting sick even lower, death even lower that. There's one line card. Next time I'll get Moderna.

I'll take it. :) 

AND! Today younger daughter officially fully vaccinated. Two weeks post second shot. Five weeks post 12th birthday. fast could gotten it. 

I feel much peace now. probably 98%+ sero-negative individuals. broad group unvaccinated (at least outside countries like China, New Zealand, Australia) seropositive probably high now. Based serology, something like 70-80%+ unvaccinated infected point countries like US. full 100mcg moderna third doses since doctor recommended since i’m possibly borderline immunocompromised. side effects timing almost exactly identical second shot.

the booster 50mcg dose presumably side effects may milder. totally adult environments everyone access vaccines don’t. know answer please explain me. CDC obviously opinion rescinded mask mandate well. think fair say vaccines prevent spread. Even posit vaccinated person unvaccinated person still initial conditions viral load, fact vaccinated person ""clear"" virus system faster unvaccinated person, thereby reducing window spread.  Wonder Chick-fil-A react this. 18 months still don’t grasp adults might need masks? Typical redditor. Consider rope. want sick person making and/or handling food?

I'm reminded time got hit strep throat KP basic (kitchen duty, washing dishes). hit dinner really hard. went sick call next morning, got shot butt, time got back unit announced every unit went chow hall get shot day. vaccine STD though (except HPV), right? People didn’t stop sex shooting up. stopped seeing doctor symptoms receiving treatment cure infections. makes likely pass on. No? please stop defeatist redefinition endemic current/last two year situation is/was? Tons diseases/viruses endemic guarantee thought twice last decade. cannot completely eradicate something mean continue drive daily lives. Taiwan done pretty well everyone vaccinated? vulnerable people work need protection? work health care? Work public facing job? 

There lot reasons masks might required. Yikes, yesterday 2000 unvaccinated people passed away. That’s still insane high .   !RemindMe 1 year  0 evidence. I'm blaming people. I'm blaming US's total lack infrastructure, social safety nets, desire communal good, sane health care systems. government leadership work culture, workers. Series: vaccine administered 2-dose series, 3 weeks apart. third dose may administered least 4 weeks second dose individuals determined certain kinds immunocompromise.

It seems like Pfizer still recommending extremely short intervals doses, despite evidence longer intervals produce stronger durable immunity: [Sustained Cell Immunity, Protection Boosting Using Extended Dosing Intervals BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine](http://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3891065). Realistically, scientific reason Pfizer think three weeks would ideal length doses; picking three weeks expediency face pressure get trials done quickly.

In practice, people getting third dose already received second dose far four weeks ago, especially they're vulnerable populations boosters strongly recommended. would China stay covid free endemic rest world? something love you’ll never work day life! I'm sure writing good faith, clarify, yes STOP spread, HEAVILY REDUCE it. Great way lead pack...honestly great news!! 99% survival rate same!

They’re taking resources maintain public safety around choices, expect foot bill. also make sense close university outbreak exists highly effective vaccine.

This nonsense. close places measles outbreaks much higher vaccination rate effective vaccine measles. much effect measles outbreaks rare (although expect become common anti-vax definitely become popular past year).

There's public health policy endemic disease vaccinating everyone ignoring otherwise. Barring major change (like magical 99.9% effective vaccine), public health officials going watching COVID-19 numbers rest lives suggesting varying levels mitigations based current numbers *just like flu measles*. That's said. fabricate quotes push false narrative. vaccinated, even get every booster shot available every six months whenever, would actually change make things safer?

The amount natural immunity unvaccinated increase. Hopefully hybrid immunity present vaccinated well, future infections totally asymptomatic. Either transmissible get exposed time exposure acts like free booster without getting shot, immunity good enough burns unvaccinated population really come back. 

""more powerful"" boosters meaning what? antibodies? necessary, really, would need more? Maybe mucosal antibodies would better. Broader antibodies? Already good enough known variants, sometimes even viruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS).

The biggest question need answered ""does immunity infection vaccination look like immunity vaccination infection?""

If so, likely sooner rather later. not, lot questions. Well, masks general really helped reduce flu season almost nothing, that’s one reason keep wearing indoors least height flu season. don’t get it. common sense measures aren’t never meant permanent even long-lasting, could would *temporary* selfish hypocrites keeping thing going 2021 couldn’t bothered personally inconvenienced even weeks, lead us measures mandates lasting even longer. largely *their fault* measures appearance permanent.  hospitals PNW still surgeries cancelled yet rescheduled due number covid patients 😡 Well mean guns perfect way social distance hurt someone.

after 2nd shot somewhat intense fever/chills/cold sweats 12 hours shot lasted 5 hours. 

I got third shot 24 hours ago Walgreens seemed pretty disorganized unused giving shot kind concerned may given wrong thing, like saline flu vaccine walgreens seems done before. 

idk im paranoid would expected *some* systemic effects dose heard similar 2nd dose. It’s two weeks actually, even there’s lag many deaths insane point time, anything normal. sort messaging undercuts vaccination efforts. want people vaccinate kids present way out. she’s said instead “vaccinate kid everything stay exactly end sight” Everyone busy cussing Dixie Chicks followed rules laid out. got vaccinated soon could. *not ever* gotten COVID.

Thanks spelling tip. 


So, I'm actually pro COVID vaccination, lines freedoms keep eroding. public health issue leveraged undermine flip script right popular. 


Should people vaccinate? doctor's agreement, yes. FORCED to? FUCK NO. j&amp;j less booster second dose. efficacy even hospitalizations substantially lower mRNA vaccines. feel weird it. There's good reason FDA authorized boosters everyone got j&amp;j despite limited authorization mRNA boosters. masks required airplanes Might difference restrictions. Worth remembering term layers protection Covid. Vaccines like airbags car. true, us would rather less intrusive restrictions avoid lockdown, like mandatory masking. fact there's petition Change government bring 'Plan B'. I’m curious anyone able articulate things might change US by, say, year now, terms careful need around COVID.

Let’s say maximum percentage people ever get vaccinated 60%. Everyone else continues refuse.

If happens, might ever change reduce risk maskless around people? Even vaccinated, even get every booster shot available every six months whenever, would actually change make things safer?

Would we’re simply waiting virus mutate time become less dangerous? we’ll get powerful boosters? we’ll likely get COVID point we’ll hopefully powerful treatments won’t big deal?

Or thing I’m missing help life go pretty much back normal year now, even five years now? Cool. Get back respected scientists publish peer-reviewed studies it. then, give flying f**k fantasies. There's huge variance people react vaccine. me, people know, zero effect it. nothing happened all. aware people feel like shit after. I'm anti-vaxxer I'm fine this. wonder control group kind study late 2021. ethically offer placebo proven vaccines already available. Good portugal, whatever happens impact life all.

Most studies PCR screening individuals screen antibodies (and nobody even thinks testing T-cells due difficulty). unvaccinated control group could considerable natural immunity due asympomatic infection, would rise time.  Covid rates drop (hopefully) extremely low point coming months

I think point drop flu season. respiratory virus increase transmission winter, saw previous winter includes SARS-CoV-2.

We absolutely see increase winter. Everywhere.  reason could see need masking another surge occurs hospitals nearing full capacity. Although that's issue large percentage population remains unvaccinated.   ridiculous. 98%?! vaccines work?

This implies children *already been* wearing masks school. Florida, they're actually *prohibited* requiring that.

And Florida (read: DeSantis) essentially ignoring CDC day one, so.... they're possibilities control? That's fine, course. imagine fortunate positions I'm sure extra day work would welcome. Especially toxic customer/retail facing roles. *

*And thousands permutations may make true false. I'm speaking generally Reddit. Masking plenty good people go work next day doctor's appointments. thinking along lines lol. seem like good thing.

Hopefully get booster ASAP six months you. legit bird flu taken now? lost large part failed pandemic response. DeSantis picked baton failure. Remember. Businesses free want, long want board agrees apparently. mean “white peoples?!” /s Yes generalized. 
I live Bible Belt. folks claim devoted. None truly are. societal pressure fear god instilled young age follows life. tremendous guilt think deterring path. It’s easier go church socialize appear devoted guilt minimize hope good person believing god save end harm done. Correct, think.  They've said every winter last twenty years seasonal illnesses. 

The number Covid patients 6x lower January, they're nowhere near brink.  hospitalized Covid patients mostly treated symptoms. Supplemental O2 steroids inflammation.  time sick enough hospital, often late antibody treatments. flu annual epidemic regular consistent number flu cases every year expected. way word used CDC (and people medical community) means outbreak something exceeds projected models, expectations, historical markers. 

So use flu example... annual rise flu cases expected flu virus endemic (it persists never going away running control). 

But years suddenly expected uptick severe faster, might signal flu epidemic. instance U.S. around 250-500k flu-related hospitalizations per year around 15-50k deaths, depending year. That's whole ""influenza season."" hit numbers first weeks ""flu season"" would whole different story.  !RemindMe 1 year not. board hates Christians. didn’t say specific day. Lol.

There reason chose 6 months haven’t explained why, saying time frame would arbitrary.

When mean US, say US!

Are places like Italy, Denmark, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Iceland, Canada part so-called ""Western world"" yours? United States monopoly western, much like pretend do. Quite frankly, good old-fashioned American arrogance US situation regards COVID.

Furthermore, South Korea plenty religious idiots protested public health protocols; first big COVID outbreak South Korea caused member religious cult, let's drop whole Orientalist ""Oh, Asian people much respect everyone listens government!"" bullshit they'll tell that. 

That said, course, they've done much better job US, many Western countries? Why? governments run incompetents turn around cater insane people.   relative, right? start smaller numbers bigger deal, we're almost jaded exponentially bigger numbers.

Instead focusing many lives may/may save, think also need look trying reduce pressure health systems, turn reduce number lives lost, either directly from/with COVID, indirectly, like procedure needing pushed back/cancelled, etc.

There's also real effect healthcare workers, associated professions. Feels like focus number people dying this, much larger impact us whole.

And that's ignoring comments question effectiveness masks, vaccines prevention measures, like one above. also becoming less significant people vaccinated exposed COVID. point everything becomes ""booster"". Masks going much good people packed sweaty moshpit gig exchanging saliva dancefloor club.   do!
 also this:  Makes sense me. getting closer closer letting electively unvaccinated roll dice rather putting mitigation strategies protect them.

Those two big questions mind.

Last year, kept hearing long-term COVID symptoms -- brain fog, sleep problems, fatigue, etc. One main concerns personally is, get COVID, ""mild case,"" still long-term symptoms? That's scary stuff, even virus going put ICU.

In terms political will, that's something also worry about. something place public safety, becomes hard rollback. know old anyone thread is, remember 55mph speed limit? *extremely* unpopular across political stripes place like 25 would like say we've also learned lesson sick leave and/or staying home sick may cultural shift there, I've heard plenty people told work sick pandemic long negative COVID test, hold much hope that.

Yeah, hoping cultural shift too. Also, mind permanent etiquette sick, wear mask. That's norm Asia great.

Unfortunately, seems right norm we're slipping dichotomy ""never anything"" crowd ""always everything"" crowd. yeah, let's trust Yelp. they're still relevant. /s different pharmacies (much less county health clinics) Colorado. attest meeting criteria there's questions asked.

You likely talking different things. Pfizer booster doses already authorized CDC certain groups received Pfizer primary vaccine, pretty easy get Pfizer booster dose attesting belong one groups.

The CDC also authorized additional doses Moderna immunocompromised people (but additional doses boosters, different dosage considered part primary vaccine series)

Parent likely talking booster doses people received Moderna J&amp;J primary vaccine course want booster. Authorization boosters currently discussed CDC (literally [right  necessarily.

If checked data yourself, specifically Louisiana every minority outpaces white vaccination.

In lot states, one minority group ahead another behind (for example: Alaska blacks vaccinated whites, Hispanics less vaccinated. Asians tend outpace whites overwhelming amount states too).

Otherwise, seem data specifically pits white vaccination vs minority vaccination state state basis. How's side effects?

This ""every flu season bad flu season, forever"" scenario. Historically, bad flu seasons meant louder calls get flu vaccine keep eye symptoms stay home potentially contagious (which basically everyone ignores) much else.

So, yeah, situation (which seems fairly likely), suspect difference current flu measures stronger pushes get vaccinated (i.e. mandates may stay place Moderna working combination COVID+flu vaccine, flu vaccine may end *de facto* mandatory), masks lot popular, mandatory long severe outcomes stay low. think wildcard common non-death severe outcomes are, surprising scaled deaths. where/when political repeal mask mandates shows up.

Pfizer around 90% death far lower protection symptomatic infection. here's another mutation might knock another 5% effectiveness that's sort big deal. either need make 3rd dose required full vaccination like Israel start making actual variant based vaccines.

Aside that, I've got super minor headache (like, even Tylenol worthy), slight wave nausea lasted less hour. 

All all, bad. taking easy today ♡ places, like Northeast, continue show degree risk aversion, mitigate risk mask wearing, mask wearing schools, numbers like UKs.

There nothing suggest that, considering landscape (boosters pediatric vaccines coming day) UK lifted restrictions far different. That's guessing based preferred level risk aversion. lead massive deaths hospitalizations?

No, now. Masks scant NE, even mandates, death rates nearly flat entire summer. lead significantly elevated deaths among elderly

Again, nothing suggest especially boosters immunocompromised approved weeks boosters elderly (and basically anyone wants them) around corner. 

Further, NE far people vaccinated UK even now, mention back lifted restrictions. UK **NOW** 67/73% (full/first), freedom day 53/69%, VT 70/79%, 70/80%, CT 70/78%, RI 70/77%. reason say ""it's over."" That's coping psychological trivia.

Besides fact argument logically hold water, point posts *it frankly matter*. People made decisions willing deal with, NE Delta really whimper move needle much terms changing public sentiment. 

IF serious surge (doubtful), super cautious cower, go winter holiday plans. Socially, really it. None vaccines use diseases need 4 shoots, boosters long-lasting. example, get dose Hepatitis B birth, one 1 month, one 5 months. protects life.

But amount propaganda that's pushed Russia last years hard trust them. honestly want know effective vaccine reducing infections, least minimizing severity symptoms (and death). want know whether noteworthy side effects want know whether could safely combined mRNA vaccines. Probably won't. considering state wide vaccination average historically 96% that's still pretty bloody good.

The guy saying doctors smartest truly something. too, honestly. Covid endemic, question long declared such. DAD, GET INTERNET!!! quit reason GF. refused let us wear masks gloves mandated, didn’t collect vaccine info legally required county, bullied associates called Covid symptoms. also didn’t report outbreaks counties required associates exposed told. new job treats whole lot better. yes, gift bullshit. give cash something. Actually... People already murdered enforcing masks yeah don’t think anyone wants job younger kids chance get vaccinated next couple months, we’re gonna need start adjusting way measure community risk levels. 

Assuming vaccines convey good protection death, hospitalization even “stay home feel super shitty” level serious illness (and data suggests that’s case), longer makes sense focus case numbers.

The thing we’re going need watch spread amongst unvaccinated, represent threat rest us clogging ICUs life-and-death COVID cases expense people otherwise need beds. focus preventing happening, probably monitoring hospital capacity banning unvaccinated participating activities get infected starts climb. 

But unless somebody show there’s significant risk vaccinated (like new variant), shouldn’t asked shoulder burden. all, COVID whittled away level threat flu population, there’s reason restrict further. suspect politically won’t stand kids/grandkids vaccinated.   That’s least specific metric debate. 

The problem “endemic” state basically means R-number averages 1.0 time, virus going extinct, it’s circulating steady rate. 

So asking R 1.0 sustained period really “elimination” goal, goal compatible living disease endemic situation.

If adjust metric to, e.g. R &lt; 1.5 specific number months, becomes achievable goal. massively busy every location prob serving 1000 people day per location It’s bit pain, download data directly government dashboard also API, programming experience API, [I’ve generated graph showing cases 0-19 year olds compared total cases (included Winter wave comparison). &lt;20s making close half cases since mid-September. Lol fuck getting info? wrong gross. Nasty. worked there. follow health code. However, don’t report Covid required, they’re mean employees call symptoms, didn’t follow county requirements collect vaccination status. So……this didn’t shock all. also didn’t let us wear masks gloves required didn’t “scare customers” shit. should. many morons refusing US anyways don’t blame them. minimum wage employee last thing I’d want get verbally assaulted possibly physically assulted anti-vaxxers.

And start 5G BS, like strong signal everywhere go. still solid protection antibody test tell nothing benefit booster. correlation determined yet individual regarding degree protection. population level, yes, individual decisions. fall age/clinical criteria, get booster. not, criteria likely liberalized weeks get booster then. link isn’t loading, I’m assuming it’s primarily referencing drops efficacy preventing infection entirely, hospitalization death.

Regardless, many vaccines require boosters…why vaccines suddenly “useless” looks like boosters might necessary road? (Or people want avoid infection altogether high risk general.)

And boner natural immunity? order get there, risk permanent damage death. there’s really guarantee long lasting either? many coronaviruses permanent immunity prior infection?

Maybe stop framing natural immunity vs. getting vaccinated mutually exclusive choices? say +65 young adults high risk severe covid eligible Moderna booster.

Moderna 200 mcg vs. 60 mcg Pfizer got first two doses. Vaccine effectiveness pretty comparable start, slight edge towards Moderna. we've seen Pfizer wanes much quicker might attributable smaller dosage.

My guess two probably quite comparable looking 50 mcg Moderna booster vs. Pfizer booster. 

The consideration whether might benefits mixing, since exposing body different vaccine (slightly different mRNA). I'm knowledgeable enough area might benefits this.

I boat would love thoughts.   that's math error don\['t think i'd mind article also details they're allowing mixing matching doses. sounds like people originally received J&amp;J vaccine eligible booster shots type.

I've missed birthdays, Christmas, time elderly family get back, I've become physically mentally less healthy. I'm lucky I'm relatively okay financially. 

Its okay laptop class call us selfish - lockdown banana bread zoom quizzes everyone. Especially no-one bother next one. Still wouldn’t go In-N-Out, even claimed 100% vaxxed. Arguably consistently terrible fast food there.

 (giving number efficacy rate 95% compared two shot regiment). Putin's propaganda biting ass seems Right - that's problem. boss like that, I'm like people manage. counter drinking smoking transmissible there’s free available vaccine protect smoking drinking. good even do? still vaxxed carry infect anyone. harassing people. Might well test everyone. yes, I’m vaxxed bring narratives in.  Hmm .. 0.2% rate breakthrough cases? That's pretty understand that, prior exposure may worsened side effects, almost certainly vaccine, latent effects COVID. Boosters probably made available problem global vaccine equity though. Still less half world received even one increase global productions vaccines needs happen, COVID-19 vaccine output estimated reach 12 billion year end 24 billion mid-2022

Personally think give boosters 2021 people high risk save everything else vaccinate world. give boosters everyone ineffective vaccines point give boosters everyone wants them.

Everything else lead bigger problems long run, even first world. hard mandate? Apple demand replace workers needed Yes please test flu too? nurse bit sister. places vaccine mandates children school, many parents get kids vaccinated. Polls show slim plurality parents want get kids vaccinated  Therefore, vaccine rollout logical end date unless consider success say 50% kids vaccinated. there's reason trust people power right issue. Kids 12 older ability get vaccinated 5 months now, many, most, gotten vaccinated yet, many high schools still require masks. expect similiar results grade schools rollout kids 12. truth covid never going away, people want get vaccinated will, choose get vaccinated, living like permanently way live. There's highly effective vaccine work preventative, limited effective treatment options infected individual takes turn worse. Additionally, still firm grasp turn worse won't, even among vaccinated. Yes, general ideas (age, obesity, etc), people outside indicators (i.e. college students often young obese), really clue. suspect colleges continue cautious infection treatment options get better.

Another point consider college campus may great shape, surrounding area terrible. youngest son's college 95% vaccinated among undergrad, 92% among graduate students exempt. Employees 98%. However, surrounding city county among worst state they're in. son also chose skip meal plan year cooking meals means regularly leaves campus. Something like 10-20% student body avenue breakthrough infections show up.

As /u/Salt_Exercise978 pointed out, they're looking minimize expense dealing outbreak - whether that's shutting even maintaining quarantine housing. mask mandate really cheap easy way help reduce risk. son's experience indication, kids care least. ""fact life"" point. Agreed...The protocols aggressively pushing school aged children get vaccinated vaccine mandates. 

Everything else waste societal political capital. favorite weird mask moment mid-April 2020 went bank wearing one teller joked weird was. Odds low. Check UK figures.   That's nonsense statistic without context.

Covid already low-risk kids, vaccine pushes risk way, way down. mask point shifting risk percentages fraction fraction percent.

Whether pandemic depends whether significant part world still situation virus can't controlled above.

So, whenever enough countries get virus controlled point isolate small areas/groups people keep anyone else getting infected, pandemic more.

A) title misleading... trials, observational studies.

B) Israeli study really looking infection directly vaccine given (post days/weeks months) vs unvaccinated groups. important risk cumulative time progresses.

Please note I'm anti-mask, I'm definitely anti-vaccine. mask usage always best bad options stemming flow covid infections (either compared shutting in-person traffic vaccines). never, ever going stop covid itself, vaccinated people low-value mitigation.

But groups people find masks comforting appreciate visual signifier takes covid seriously, we've continued mask mandates patchwork fashion instead focusing high-value mitigations like nationwide vaccine mandates. multitude studies showing masks help. Also delta wave different it’s infectious it’s apples apples comparison. masked getting vaxxed community spread acceptably low level. masks school forever then? faster uncontrolled spread H1N1 meant shitton extra deaths

Not really.  thing caused deaths mutated slightly returned winter initial wave infection.  new variant caused cytokine storms easily anyone healthy, strong immune system.  Thus, many deaths happened fall/winter young, healthy people easier catch virus indoor, enclosed spaces new variant deadlier people. near universal vaccination, need masks would disappear matter months. Hence anti-vaccination saboteurs make angry. Masks required indoors enforcement occasionally spotty.

That said, wonder there's something this. conflicting evidence waning (there [some decline similar rate like say, there's also suggests Pfizer drops faster). waning aside, wonder AZ's efficacy would ever enough get R 1 Delta anyway? 

We knew day one probably quite good Pfizer blocking symptomatic illness (\~60-70%ish originally, think?). UK historically really low vaccine hesitancy *could* ended mattering. Vaccinating huge number people moderately efficacious vaccine theoretically get R 1, vaccinating moderate number people super efficacious vaccine.

But Delta showed twice transmissible. transmissible something is, higher either efficacy uptake need get R 1. we'd done number people higher-efficacy vaccine would R 1? idea. Would spread slower? Yes, definition.

Then again, also opened completely cases already high, anyway UK government always painfully slow act we're full crisis. Israel seemed react basically soon hint worsening cases.

I'm right around 6 month, got mine back late April remember correctly. hope find Moderna booster around me, I'd prefer robust antibody count.  it’s real vaccine.

I day get 3rd Pfizer, course. Wanted Moderna go it. Good riddance want put protection symptomatic illness back 90s, sure. looking avoid hospitalization death, probably still high enough.    age comorbidity stratification important.

The elderly, frail, severely immunocompromised significant risk *any* respiratory infection. includes everything simple common cold everyone else would shrug off. *of course* they're risk COVID infection, especially Delta. anyone know- got J&amp;J want Moderna, regular dose smaller booster dose? really really need lt governor take over. even voted independently governor necessarily party real election normal rules. something we've seen everywhere. chance death COVID roughly proportional chance death natural causes, median death around life expectancy given area. young people much less likely get vaccinated, number becomes even higher vaccination. There's evidence - - age distribution changed vaccination risk reduction differs across ages groups.

This headline exactly lie, like say - always true outside many exceptions it. still 66% increase dosage. generally agree, especially people already 2 doses mRNA vaccines. 3 doses effective absolute risk difference probably significant. Relative eligibility even already Pfizer/Moderna series eligibility list really broad long 18 example includes obese people overweight.

The measure good also late one. However, see way return normal lives without it. I’m healthy low risk medically, getting mine travel lot constantly people set work.

My native impatience running away me, helps cope understand reasons things.  Hospitals places overwhelm Delta's peak. New cases less half Delta peak, argument stopping hospitals overwhelming, argument carried little weight areas. fair, argument used handful places vaccination rates low, hospitals overflow.

Herd immunity happening now. argue even less risk, expert believes herd immunity. see countries far higher vaccination rates, less covid, achieve complete immunity.

Children little risk COVID, hospitalized die even lower risk vaccinated adults. Therefore willing let vaccinated adults unmasked... ever, see risk children COVID poor argument keep masked. clearly tolerable risk live masked 40 hours week.

&amp;#x200B;

The argument children spread adults. However, vaccinated adults, low level risk always there, that's argument always used. unvaccinated adults risk higher, they've 7 months get vaccinated. vaccinated now, them. children continue burdon wearing mask 40 hours week protect adults protect themselves.

Its also fact 5 months teenagers allowed get vaccinated, half still havent, still mask mandates highschool, expect similiar results grade schools. That's dont trust people power ever give power allow us return living. Living requires risk, always wearing masks way live. proved here, outside literally small amount places risk hospitals overflooding, argument used require masks now, used require eternity, COVID certainly endemic. Therefore, think mask mandates go away now.  vaccines great risk reduction tool little impact quality life. consider forcing kids wear mask 40 hours, logical end insight big burdon little risk.  hope many people get vaccinated possible, people choose get vaccinated, risk, burdon society negatively alter life forever protect against.  Since COVID never going away, either wear masks forever, arbitrary pick date later arbitrarily consider death level ""acceptable"" since places longer risk hospitals overflooding.  disagree. might mean, usually would, grant point sake argument state make sense deny people help self afflicted issues cases, even correct (and imho are, opinion take vaccine so), demanding would cases people make bad choices reason another.

OK fine, let's allow China partly responsible start. what? point irrelevant, exponential continuation cases developed countries one year later, vaccines literally freely available, people politicians fly selfish ""my free doms” flag. people politicians constantly claim care lack ""personal responsibility"". Hard mandates cause people invent sorts reasons apply ADA's reasonable accommodation standard.

Lmao pls guys. Please. I’m begging. Please. No.  kids going get better social skills forever? Southern California. I’ve definitely put mask due smoke. 

It individual thing makes sense. hate there’s weird pressure around wearing wearing it. I’ve seen go ways. I’ve seen people hassle people wearing one I’ve seen fully vaccinated people hassle fully vaccinated people wearing one. agree drive school bus shot. Leave mask book bag.  percent ones permanently closed due Covid?  Worst case scenario sleeping: meteor crashes roof pulverizes you.

Sleeping risky! Depends live California, there's animals habitats California require armed, instance 56 58 counties feral pigs. live work outside regions high population, want gun.  Rugged individualism ethic means self-reliant burden others. round-a-bout way collective good *do* consider others free make decisions long decisions negatively impact others.

These idiots take ""freedom"" part dump rest. Free whatever want even means leaching others. Agreed. COVID already world anybody even knew was. eradicating this. first week two, breastfeeding provides less passive immunity. antibodies longer enter child's bloodstream, provide protection hours lining digestive respiratory tracts.

Additionally, every vaccinated person continues actively produce antibodies short-term protection. Sometimes long-term B- T-cells. aware provide benefit breastfeeding.  actually seeing peoples faces years going impact long term?

I question risk vs reward masks certain social distancing practices young healthy children. think we've recognized psychological impact. 

I would expect affect adults could completely wrong assumption.  Kinda dumb overreaching. vaccine. vaccine works. cares? Let little gremlins shots leave mask home. There’s conflicting data arguments. don’t surely know, neither I. 

Regardless, take let people want give corporations less power. 

And yes, said mitigate categorizations Reddit tends put. You’re acting like don’t know narrative I’m speaking about. Like said, it’s politics.  COVID vaccines US purchased distributed federal government.  CDC given role allocating vaccines entities administering them.  one bit fine print sign administer covid vaccines, agree administer according CDC's rules get when. Yes, can, less likely since immune system jump-start containment, actual number virus particles created going much lower. reason vaccinated people less likely spread virus breakthrough cases (but still possible) looks like lasted 2.5 months average.

How reach conclusion? That's what's said all. new sub variant delta possible better transmissibility study. problem Russia people is

Being SAHM mean less intelligent. know smart people SAH parents way intelligent many working people, medical backgrounds!  People saying March 2020 expect last 2022 beyond. prediction turns accurate, sometimes worthwhile remind people. facts, poorly communicated, cause large numbers deaths.

""There serious adverse events vaccines"" fact, misses important context ""in small numbers, massively fewer get COVID"".

If CDC goes data-only, someone else needs ""what means you, lay person"" messaging goes public. Meh - probably spit test, really big deal. 

My daughter’s University testing requirements unvaccinated people it. tests dispensed vending machines campus. announced worse Delta variant? funny thing is, people likely oppose common-sense measures fight COVID problem restrictions imposed entire lives, indoctrinated since birth (okay actually many do, they're hypocrites it). Oh yeah makes sense. remember Governor going bit nuts. think definitely outlier especially relates outdoor mandates.  CDC say whether get FDA-approved booster shot? Walgreen's CVS told administer Moderna booster dose hear CDC, even doctor's prescription.   Well think masks mandated prevent flu, mandated prevent Covid transmission. Covid rates drop (hopefully) extremely low point coming months longer reason mandate them. think gradually become personal choice. people choose keep masking times, time, that's fine. won't, including me, that's fine too.  Yes, point enough people take vaccines, hospitals still danger overrun, still need masks measures. everyone took vaccine agree we'd back normal, alas, are. Vaxxed ""Spread like crazy""

Stop antivax conspiracy nonsense.   Vaccinated employees need test week. anyone explain FDA approval sufficient get booster doctor's signature? incompetent, laggard, politically trammeled CDC gets decide whether access FDA-approved treatment? No, can't really make supposition. Couple localities already returned normal. would regressing(in terms mandates) follow one size fits CDC guidance. think In-N-Outs Los Angeles drive-thru, great, even greater enhanced protection shows longer lasting effect. imagine since Israelis started boosting earlier, something report soonest. I’ve interested Singapore well. According Ministry Health, last 28 days, 98.7% local infected cases mild symptoms, 1.0% required oxygen supplementation, 0.1% ICU. I’ve also read Singaporeans often going hospital mild symptoms, causing overload. 

The vast majority deaths continue unvacced and/or elderly sick. like everywhere else.  Walgreens boss that's problem, ""capitalism"". last 2 years made depressed nostalgic life again. Europe we've mixing vector(astra-zeneca/J&amp;J) mRNA(Pfizer/Moderna) vaccines months.

Supposedly mixing offers complete protection, work differently other. I’m trying get “things go back normal” people wake fuck realize won’t. 

So trying converse people trying push narrative? Interesting. would suggest perhaps point, also make sense close university outbreak exists highly effective vaccine.  worked n let tell you, hardly religious personal level lol scientist, think that's case. New variants pop time, variants usually weaker environment existing antibodies. However, survive generally stronger resistant existing antibodies, generally contagious deadly. 

Furthermore, really newsworthy report variants much less impactful. Even factors lifespans west typically (not always) longer. Access medicine hell life extender.  Got it. Thanks. pharmacy this, mind asking? There's good bet deaths result spike cases happened month ago. Deaths always lag cases. cases stay low almost deaths month so. realm diminishing returns. percentage point harder get Someone get woman away media please. messaging (as usual) end resulting affect suppressing public sentiment towards vaccinations. understand *trying* say, parents going hear thing they've waiting year going effective enough move needle.

Due country high population density low levels previous infection, need higher vaccination rate others order able manage pandemic. 

The variant country also one worth watching... grows countries could cause concern, right basically Singapore, spike cases quick surprising weird graphs. recent rate increase cases Russia (and also Ukraine, btw) high seems consistent new highly transmissible strain. reminiscent India first encountered delta variant. I’ve seen people tiktok say planning get shot government pushed mandates.

We’re dealing children. never problem . look Science Vs. podcast, listen pandemic one early October 2019. Fauci guest, says worst scenario virus kill lot percentage wise, spreads rapidly. Pretty much exactly broke 2 months later. course he's right - Covid going nowhere, Corona viruses general going nowhere. They're permanent part landscape. evolve quickly, many ways reliably vaccinated perpetuity. actually vaccine manufacturer's wet dream... constantly evolving threat dangerous flu (so people inclined get vaccine). thing Florida. hear people post others ""freak out"" around take mask wonder different live.

And thing is, I'm really conservative circles all, think liberal vs conservative thing.

I note still wear masks transit here, though, events still require them. nobody seems really care individual level. That's really true every country. hotspots cool spots anywhere world.

[The NY Alaska hardest hit right now, 109 per 100k.

[In much smaller country, still see huge differences. Bath North East Somerset 169, Greater London 42.

The US special regard either. Sounds like dishonest reasons then. Glad wrong. fully vaccinated: 30% (291 million)

707 million first dose


Still long way go. also look fact surge missed basically New York metropolitan area L.A. Southern California area. Yet pointed last week, L.A. County right overall 61% population fully vaccinated. 12 older, 70%. look New York, example, Bronx, 57% fully vaccinated among 12 older, Queens 71%, Brooklyn 57%, Staten Island 60%. lots people left New York metropolitan area become infected, we've seen countries world vaccination levels much higher, like Singapore, like Israel. yet see happens there. say we're year half pandemic. time might feel like eternity many us, long enough really figure virus going do. say shrug dismiss remarkable work researchers done continue international level. work critical understanding limit impact virus, still much left learn. 

That excerpt latest Osterholm Update podcast. 

It currently inexplicable seen surges low vaccination areas, like parts Ozarks, Mississippi, Alabama, moderate vaccination areas, like Florida even highly vaccinated areas like Vermont. Yet moderately vaccinated areas, like NYC LA County largely spared. 

There lot still don’t know, suggest vaccines important public health tool flat irresponsible. guess overwhelmed hospitals don’t count public health problem, huh? there's flare-up university close, they're fucked. schools already closed forever another semester decreased enrollments/dropouts able collect housing costs maintain properties cripple lot schools even further. They're extremely careful simply go business, pure fear. Yes have. I’m eager happen! first grade students absolute champs wearing masks haven’t covid case classroom yet.

Personally think waiting see happens winter removing mask mandates worry holiday travel family gatherings.  asking office. one office. like discuss specific circumstances office, coworkers might better people discuss. shit Sherlock Generally countries enough sequencing would spot widespread variant country think. lot poor African countries get samples sent South Africa, many poor countries get circulating variants detected airport testing upon arrival countries.  
There new sublineages identified result tourists getting tested way Olympics, example.  
It's great levels surveillance though-- variant originated country bad sequencing program, might recognize growth advantage months guess.  

This variant really appear started UK though.  shit! Really?! think winter 2021/2022 intresting. two year people natural protection flu, people less likely get booster vaccin (our vaccination rate 92,5% among +12 stay level group people question vaccins boosters region). 


Also delta plus appeared country no. (not bad england live close england matter time). 


My health minister made quick 180 last two weeks. consider alarmist saying weeks, fear get another lockdown overcrowded hospitals.  strikes unreasonable. Another article booster shot BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine 95.6 per cent effective Covid-19 compared receiving two shots placebo, companies said Thursday, citing preliminary results first randomised, controlled trial boosters.   trial 10,000 participants completed two-shot Pfizer regimen, half randomised receive further, equal-strength dose shot, half placebo.   subgroup analyses, companies noted, showed relative efficacy “consistent” regardless age, sex, race, ethnicity underlying conditions.

Boosters probably made available everyone.

This problem global vaccine equity though. Still less half world received even one shot.

The increase global productions vaccines needs happen, faster.  Yeah, sucks, lucky, work great company always tries help sick, ask questions sick. also live Sweden get 80% normal pay sick. There’s specifics it’s literally state law applies indoor spaces. Think so? haven’t even begun develop vaccine 0-5 children yet.   data seriousness new variant yet, successive dominant variant (the European variant spread Europe Feb/March 2020, Alpha Delta) deadly previous iteration? dumb luck? medical/epidemiological reason this?

I understand variant *more contagious* next. needs happen become superior variant. also become *more deadly harmful*? scenario next variant could significantly less harmful lead decrease hospitalizations, despite contagious?

Ah ok Thanks replying. :) waves clearly follow seasonal flu metrics southern states much worse hot spend time indoors. However, also overlooking real change human intervention policy summer  suprise  seasonal. Otherwise summer wouldn’t anywhere close bad was. yes I’m taking Delta infectious account. either coming winter going total shitstorm doesn’t matter whether it’s summer winter.

In words, general guidance school children masked vaccine rolled little work situation. could company sort exemption way easy get COVID still spreading know it. Perhaps they've gotten discount insurance provide require everyone wear mask. Maybe HR lazy want put effort adjusting rules. Perhaps CEO germaphobe happy excuse force people wear masks. Nobody reddit really knows two situations comparable. Yeah first shot (AZ) gave fever, shakes, teeth shattering chills. Came 5 hours lasted day (with severity initial 10-12 hours onset). second third shots Pfizer. left feeling pretty crappy day two - kind like hangover - bad AZ. Still 100% worth it! though, putting things perspective. parent, something desperately want know. example, kid likely die COVID drowning? There's inherent risk letting kid go swimming, accept risk allow it. 

How risk getting &amp; dying COVID visit outdoor zoo compared risk drowning go lake? Yourself. ""natural"" immune response wanes end COVID yet again. again. time damage, outright kill you.

So, strictly speaking science perspective, adults wear masks adult settings like office workplace? Many states cases plummeting. statistical pandemic curve, finishing third wave. people got sick, became immunized. Vaccine rollout helped hospitalizations. Yeah, pharmacists, nurses like learn heart lot complicated things. is… think math vaccine 40% effective preventing infection symptoms, based number observed there. 

For ICU death think half unvaccinated.

Sadly medical condition vaccine go far.
Of course still take still good.

Just risk population still pay attention. always case even flu. States soon follow. Good riddance. Hopefully profit used fund additional research effective treatments. effective compared unvaccinated? Like 99%? Npr discussing morning. gross oversimplification six am: covid part cold viruses nature, eventually like colds. mutated much faster flu pandemics, good indicator going awhile. Colds mutate every two years so, covid probably similar, eventually harmless already exposed via infection vaccine. trick figure stop vaccines vaccinated person gets it, still mild, versus vaccinated individuals getting long enough final dose make problem them. that's figured out, everyone pretty safe except unvaccinated children. since mild infants apparently, they'll eventually catch protection they're older damage..

Honestly way talking children part reminded lot chicken pox parties kid. changed headline last edit 4 hours ago, saw it. used exact headline article first published yesterday.  anyone else experiencing increase hair loss? wife losing quite bit hair going COVID end July - August. ended hospital pneumonia we've read lack oxygen cause it, we're 100% sure. currently trying make doctor's appointment, figured I'd ask people may too. wife clean brush least 4 5 times session constantly pulling ends hair throughout day. course, there's magical cutoff age people suddenly contract Covid-19. general, younger people get sick, still catch it, sometimes get sick too.

It's also weird many countries report vaccination percentages based eligible population. 80% eligible vaccinated great, 16+ 18+ eligible, overall percentage going much lower. can't ignore significant chunk population exist.. Except case John would get serious legal trouble (not slap-on-the-wrist legal trouble executives-going-to-jail-trouble) John actually great person, least intentionally lied knowing fact great person. 

You criticize Pfizer profiteering vaccines want (although amount profit generated versus economic value vaccines insanely whack profit noise, anything incents companies continue research vaccines probably highest ROI-for-society pharmaceutical research have, especially compared yet-another-reformulation-of-soon-out-of-patent-protection-drugs), trying say Pfizer conducting fraudulent trials publishing fraudulent results pretty bold claim. 

I want say clinical trial fraud happen (the DOJ asked funding investigate area), literally crime, civil matter.  Yeah, love people think saying “it’s endemic” makes so, move on. 

The majority world vaccinated yet, stays pandemic happens. *2060: new variant shows covid developed opposible thumbs, doctors recommend locking doors, home invasions covid set increase* case would say so. don’t want told believe control infection risk safely. see unions fighting mandates. First off, state personal health choices. OK put another person's health risk that? Complete B.S. People can't trusted point right thing, themselves, greater good others health issues cannot control. 

We mandates impose people can't trusted right thing. best way avoid mandates suck get shots. Plain simple. Stop making everything full political bullshit.

At point, can't trusted keep others safe, trusted job requires that. obligated keep employment. privilege job, right. either ""Tested"", ""Vaccinated"" ""Recovered"" find perfectly fine.  vaccination checks seem dumb. Even ignore problems associated asking low-paid workers try police stuff, supposed actually determine vaccine card valid? cards real security (no hologram, security strip, anything). employee supposed ask ID well verify name card matches ID picture?  read could coronaviruses covid kicked quickly decided actively lied to, end. may vaccines partial effectiveness, treatments, covid-19 stay anyone bit knowledge could plainly see that. Unfortunately misinformation meant reasonable long-term measures place, travel restrictions etc etc remain. CDC approval, FDA. yesterday.   know they're going zero-covid whatever possible avoid another Wuhan.  impossible. Australia NZ like ones it, worked - delta came along. abandoned plan living *personally* agree you, quit shaming someone who's vaccinated. Yeah, late party. Yeah, sounds like may understand process needing get second. 

But shaming people finally come around gotten vaccinated off-putting. Others vaccinated may turned further. person shaming may less likely tell others get vaccinated. accomplishes nothing making people mad.

Finally, blown away began hit people get vaccinated. huge spectrum. antivax, scared reasons including 1) missing time hourly job they've heard side effects. 2) Concerns safety (yeah know, every shred evidence says safe, concerned different antivax). 3) Believing need prior infection. 4) Difficulty visiting vaccination sites. Especially true people rural areas people without reliable transportation. 5) Fear cost. Clearly we've huge problem good communication. realize free. 6) Ignorance risk. one upsets much, different antivax. friends family believe risk COVID low basically zero. One family member got vaccinated right away knew see family members weren't. person vaccines antivax. Another friend (finally) got vaccinated. awful misinformation campaign fed steady stream lies.

Your comment struck nerve know folks situation. meet someone got vaccinated, congratulate them!  Don’t Covid denier/anti-vaxxer things like won’t happen. downvoted? Correct. Long covid seems prevelant average virus. choice death? Thanks bringing clarity. see people read think efficacy gain compared two doses  routinely testing asymptomatics random segments population? excellent news! anything, language used document makes non-obvious casual reader effective is. point I'll try make aligns closely trial, booster dose administered individuals previously received Pfizer-BioNTech primary two-dose series **r*****estored vaccine protection COVID-19 high levels achieved second dose*****, showing relative vaccine efficacy 95.6% compared receive booster**. first efficacy results randomized, controlled COVID-19 vaccine booster trial.

So reader who's adept interpreting kinds reports might think, ""95.6%? Yeah sound pretty much like original stats effectiveness two doses, 95% something, yeah guess restore effectiveness level.""

But saying ""restores effectiveness level seen second dose"" underrates protection, since stats vaccine effectiveness two doses expressed reduction risk relative *unvaccinated*, reduction risk reduction risk relative *doubly vaccinated* (as quoted text mentions). they're sort making apples-to-oranges comparison expense.

Of course already pointed risk reduction relative unvaccinated even impressive -- I'm emphasizing language used makes easy miss point. unvaccinated people. don’t say. Spanish flu traveled much grown person refer flu today. kind wild hear people still talking masks restrictions. I'm Texas worn mask weeks (I briefly wore mask occasionally hospitals overloaded, slow decline). place requires it. places ""mask required"" signs tbh walk confidently nobody say anything haha. Nobody complains masks lack masks. People just...wear want.

And know what...our cases low, steadily going lower, hospitalization levels keep dropping.

I feel like living different world lot United States.  Waves determine something endemic. rhinovirus endemic waves. 

I think thereputics improve eventually covid dangerous, I'm team ""it's stay""

And thereputics developed ICU'S brink collapse every flu season expect masks stay.  bit (the dismantlement of) regulations (internationional) systemic inequality still much applies.  He’s asking antigen.
The vax delivered arm shouldn’t antigens spike protein mucosal cells.  support it. Hydroquinone skin lightener/ melanin inhibitor. Great tretinoin Melasma. see, well, experienced opposite here, mention early drop measures get lot downvotes. Many different narrative bubbles here.

RKI said week expects worst things spring us able drop mandates left. Truth nobody knows covid situation develop several months thats best guess. Theres lot pressure drop measures asap thats unscientific imo. Sucks suck  Well staying home sick easy essential workers. US idea staying home feeling sick became deemphasized like April 2020, policymakers hyperfocus pre-symptomatic transmission. lead places implemented additional sick leave cheaper require working class wear masks give sick leave.

I'd heartbeat, I'd make sure schedule dose Friday afternoon feel like absolute shit work again. Well, lockdowns harsh, way shorter. “The science” never told us this, certain people interpreted information came (formally educated, seemingly reasonable/logical, therefore acceptable, opinion) guidelines shared guidelines believed best advice. 

But anyone understands respects science knows ever-changing need adapt flex new data theories evidence. complicating factor consider misguiding CDC early (which believe somewhat deliberate- conserve PPE, minimize panic, whatever excuse may been).  anyone know Moderna delivered zero promised vaccines?

Edit: also JandJ? like JandJ flying shelves available. think flu kills general (vaccinated vaccinated combined) COVID kills vaccinated. sure that's best metric though, idea breakdown flu deaths among vaccinated is. got vaccinated soon could want protected. understand vaccinated people want punish vaccinated. get sick, need live die decision. think start docking paychecks well. sure?

I've eaten there. Introduced friends simple joy n Out. Finland week August wedding--masking indoors public pretty good then, noticed anything different. guess time restrictions live music bars restaurants, eateries museums seemed enforcing capacity limits, that's since lifted.  really need talking exit strategy

Is one? I'd argue daily testing *better* vaccinated testing worries could make virus yet transmissible, could possibly undermine Covid-19 vaccines further.

To ""undermine vaccines"" problem fear variant passing by. even true variants make vaccines useless virus, due b many unknowns surrounding new descendent delta variant dubbed “variant concern” yet.

This. specialists even tell one Delta sub variants may catastrophic original strain. Let's hope case one too. robbed register anyway Convenience Case numbers don’t matter. number patients admitted hospitals UK steadily increasing since beginning October, though remains far wave infections last winter forced lengthy nationwide lockdown. Eventually point much optimization new host. Additionally, vaccination becomes widespread worldwide cases down, there's chances virus mutate. I'm 100% sure point already, might be. still red-queen treadmill changes, big jumps often per year. 

AY4.2 may first variant since Delta spread might detectible advantage Delta even epidemiologists seem consider important even slight advantage. Given transmissible Delta compared viruses little I've seen GoF research/modeling, seems easy path forward massive increase transmissibility immune escape. think get new variant important Alpha Delta epidemiologically next year, small gains like AY4.2 may continue pop for, especially another winter wave. cumulative effect bumps, could important. Why's everybody anti-mask here? CDC tried spring failed miserably. Saying we'll able take masks get vaccinated work. So, convince nutty neighbors get vaccinated, we're stuck masks.    little two months away…. Pretty sure 5 year old could make prediction. necessarily protect them, breakthrough cases well saw delta. getting tested positive , even though probably deathbed, huge disruptor still workforce still confusing. 

Like population million people, study found 1 boosted person got infected 10 non-boosted persons got infected... say booster generated 1000% increase protection non-boosted group. Even though groups 99.9999% people protected. 

So real news 5,000 non boosted people, 109 got reinfected. still seeing 97% real-world protection nonboosted group. seeing 99% protection boosted. 

At least that's seems saying me. Bruh. People going die. government media partially responsible anti-vax. mean, president flu, Tuskegee experiments, saying masks work supply low, nobody using President's authority manufacture mass, acting like first vaccines would stop thing dead, opening schools antimask stuff? Cutting education funding, teaching evolution, part pandemics, school might upset folks. 

These people problem, untrustworthy government media problem. 

They even shut borders stuff first started. 

So please keep empathy folks. need protection. Remember us washing surfaces like something spread fast? joke?  definitely, sadly :( Donald Trump created problem due unwillingness admit mistake taking covid-19 seriously less 2 years ago. time 731,541 Americans died. Conservatives put ideology science. Anyone still denying science ergo covid vaccine stage 6,728, 897,586 doses vaccine administered either listening science plain stupid. Whom'st've   We've found we're incubating many viruses daily basis ;)

I think us reactive rather proactive.  save click ... Yahoo article wrapper links National Review opinion pieces Twitter.  perceive ""punishment"" that's head homie reality. Get vaxxed friend-o ;;;;;;;;;)  really great question really know answer data time.

Many vaccines need 2 doses order establish long lasting immunity, might that's needed here.

An alternative, suspect likely, outcome immunity wane booster, requiring routine booster shots (or sort re-exposure). Why? combination several things, biggest fact able reinfected endemic human coronaviruses yearly. Though vaccines (mrna viral vector both) producing excellent immune response, mechanism immune response, fundamental level, natural infection. slight pluses minuses immunological level immunity natural infection vaccine (though vaccine obvious massive clinical benefit since get disease first place), ultimately reason think vaccine last substantially longer immunity natural infection.

Immunity vaccines starts waning seems timeframe similar prior endemic human coronaviruses (under year), natural infection coronavirus seems producing similar picture. Add ongoing genetic drift similarities spike protein human receptors (meaning bodies need temper immune response attack body - ie myocarditis), really think 3 done type vaccine.

All say, know wait see (and study). suspect, boosters prove remain safe, place least years. might discover even waning levels immunity provide adequete ongoing protection symptomatic protection young healthy need boosters, higher risk require routine boosting (akin currently several diseases). Apple zero balls mandate puss bags. No, complete different vials different color tops ensure get mixed doses That's fair point, personally want avoid kind infection that's probably wishful thinking part. case, I'm looking protected winter season provide that. Thanks, appreciate perspective. going drag (&amp; grow) lot longer that. science said masks effective. 

The science told us take groceries one one wipe down. 

The science said there’s way virus came human intervention. 

The science said close cities. 

The science killed countless small business owners livelihoods. 

There’s reason people moving away New York flooding Florida. think little kids/toddlers get vaccinated point. point want take chances go ahead, rest us continue mask (socially distance etc...) sake. see hospitals keeping masks staff visitors different situation together.  That’s ask fries “well done” Covid endemic transmission rate super low it’s gonna huge deal. hospitals aren’t constantly clogged w covid patients likely indicator clear, shifted specific scope ""state public health emergency"" whereby pandemic continue managed legal umbrella.

Pretty much distinction without difference.  I'm small business owner work kids. love do, I'm job, like best. It’s can’t eat food mask on. It’s risk we’ve decided accept. Sometimes practicality wins.

I fear comment u-Intrepid_Chocolate56 correct. fair mind we'll continue wearing masks indoors.

I say, almost two years perceived vital space increased considerably.

Like, day queuing enter post office guy started talk me. wearing masks outside, thought ""dude, breathing space, back off"".

Get vaccinated.  executive order allows medical religious exemptions. China, Honk kong Taiwan.

Can’t safe easily safer.. I’ve sick year lost count number times exposed. Really good article, thanks posting  still around 30-40% 6mo would decrease faster linear hit 0 11. fact need boosters surprise anyone. Look vaccine pertussis (whooping cough). get whole series shots child even enough. I've seen lot recommendations adult, going spend time around small children, get booster.

To honest, see similar athletic training. Spend time training shape. Sit butt, slowly lose athletic ability. Train again, get shape again. endless cycle. alternative continuous training. Since continuous exposure virus ideal, I'll take periodic boosters instead. Bad bot. Fosun license BioNTech make vaccine. regulators still approved vaccine use China. Considering that's vaccine that's approved everywhere else world, must political. want use vaccines developed China. Good info thank you!  I've also somewhat irritated lack focus ventilation, well air purification. knowledge though, contract tracing phased places Asia numbers continue small enough make work?

Here's hypothetical. Suppose COVID becomes less deadly vaccines acquired immunity brunt it, suppose even mutates less deadly equally infectious. Suppose, sake argument, stabilizes bit worse flu kills 800k per year (the flu kills 600k).

Would still take mitigation measures beyond yearly flu/covid shots? inclined to. question straw man argument. premise vaccinations don’t prevent infection. Yeah, like strictly enforced masking. NPIs powerful consistently followed. vaccines last line defense, line. automod feisty post?

Even companies serious allowing legitimate opt exemptions still going people granted exemptions, especially company size Apple. getting exemption mean automatic pass everything. totally reasonable (and lots legal precedent) company say get exemption means regularly get tested and/or wear mask times. reasonable accommodation mean get put coworkers risk. Yes think so. study article looking says held up? Thank you, knew saw something else couldn’t find it.   Agree disagree ""nothing"" many unvaccinated people caught time period?  5 days travel probably fine. immune response disease seen fast. second doses antibodies reached maximum 7 days, could certainly try get days sooner. They're getting taste medicine. Makes sense. Colorado's health department governor strongly pro-third-dose. aware FDA considers boosters (unnecessary) third doses (obviously good everyone) different things, idea we're getting here.

My parents third Moderna dose family medical center month ago; one county health department clinic two days ago.  81% public support mandatory masks recent polls, largely restrictions vaccine passport introduced rest Europe.

No idea people saying 'no appetite' 'lack public support' getting from.  /r/nottheonion public learns waning antibody counts totally natural good, perhaps politicians stop listening drug company lobbyists make sane policy like distributing vaccine low income countries instead pushing child vaccinations yet another booster.  Polling shows **is strong** support restrictions among public.

81% support mask mandate

77% support work home mandate

67% support vaccine passport  Many/most states requirements state DoH and/or Governor's office approve vaccine. approved, pretty much every state same.

As right now, strongly doubt get Moderna booster shot pharmacy Colorado would violating terms EUA. could get Third Dose Shot, similar same, booster. Depends long immunity lasts virus mutates well. Lots variables, far think anywhere claim they've reached true herd immunity. Damn... Good riddance! Nah, unrealistic. Covid clearly came Wario Waluigi's snot sneezed Chinese guy's arm visiting Mushroom Kingdom came back snot guy's arm mutated, causing spread virus China world.

Source: trustmebro.com  us cut friendships antivaxxers (covid), either don’t want exposed virus anger people making pandemic much, much worse. I’m curious going patch relationships pandemic downshifts endemic, continue view antivaxxers longer circle. I’ve got one lifelong friend one adult daughter stubbornly refusing get vaxxed, tbh I’m pissed afraid infection, sure feelings ever going return Times. forgive forget?  Zyenep Tufekci this. honestly needs senior position CDC, would improve pandemic response much. That, unfortunately, good question.

But great handle modeling future spread COVID-19, know reduced ventilation\*, vaccines, masks. levels low, contact tracing also theoretically used reduce transmission; worked countries there's cultural legal reasons worked well US. Obviously, know reducing amount/size gatherings also works, long-term solution.

\*The lack focus ventilation continues frustrating. almost certainly important masks standing 6 feet apart, requires burden individuals. CO2 meters easy cheap way measure it. step 1: wear mask first In-N-Out too. middle one largest tourist areas one popular cities US. Probably unique really.  breakthrough cases really bad? Reddit representation bad ones? frustrating data severity breakthrough cases. understand hospitalizations deaths super low seems considerable minority get hit super bad? give additional clarity, rough delineation FDA CDC following: 

* FDA approves manufacture shipment vaccine.
* CDC approves shots go arms processes make sure spot something goes wrong.


It's obviously bit nuanced that's reasonable delineation.

An example problem CDC covers: Lets say shots given see major issues people. tainted batches, unseen adverse reaction, something else? tell shots batch booster third dose? CDC addresses shots/batches coded, questions like answered. also address aspects adverse reaction tracking (Vsafe) cases. Also, vaccine effectiveness infection decreases \~99% 1 month mark \~80% (which still high vaccine) 6 month mark. One analogy (although probabilities involved same) like unprotected sex female partner birth control. first half tiny, mean tiny chapel. always say likely cause gun death comes immediate family. Cooping people lockdown obviously going exacerbate that. outside? like MG messaging, true “the entire point vaccines get back normal”.

The point vaccines save huge number lives *and* get us back normal, agree transition need eventually make—I’m forever masking. hard compare one province vs entire continent bunch European countries dropped almost restrictions.

Despite everything ""open"" Ontario, still lots restrictions (ie. night clubs still severe capacity limits).

I think perhaps even importantly, cases seem skyrocket every place declares ""mission accomplished"" likely psychological switch makes everyone act like covid throw caution wind. see Canada BC/AB/SK ended virtually restrictions summer got hit much harder 4th wave compared ON/QC/Maritimes fucking embarrassing ya duh? Actually, ""my freadomz"" argument - common anti-vax stance. San Francisco allows businesses operate without validating vaccination status - simply allow dine-in service. Businesses opt offer dine-in service validate vaccination status.

In basically said ""we want benefit dine-in service, costs"". article noted, businesses want enforce vaccine mandate opted offer take-out service - In-and-Out made choice clear ways.

The article also notes In-and-Out business far shut due taking approach... need mental health hold well, 14 days meds. Someone know got Johnson Johnson vaccine back spring. got pretty bad case Covid recently. feel like vaccine two shot vaccine, like rest them. funeral last weekend someone died covid. 20-something people there, 4 us wearing masks. mind boggling. crazy minimal suggestions gif compared we're expected now, 500 something days thing.

It could easy gif. Many people probably disagree, stay-at-home orders, closures, obsessive masking likely minimal effect overall COVID outcomes massive effects overall population mental health. 

And now, 500 something days it, plenty people still washing groceries, still avoiding human interaction, still living life fear. ""solutions"" fear-driven public-health driven that's fault terrible public health messaging ego-centric politicians. damn. I'm 40 fairly healthy.. want booster. Well here’s one way get people stop caring COVID deaths. true antigen (fast) PCR tests? Always interesting missing basic skill reading comprehension try push failures onto others. shame. transmissible get exposed time exposure acts like free booster without getting shot, immunity good enough burns unvaccinated population really come back.

Thank you! I'm curious part: think exposure acting like free booster, would mean there's upside getting COVID first time, say, two years versus tomorrow? Maybe better hospital capacity then? 

I ask I've friends say they've decided less careful since they're likely going get COVID point, might well get get ""free booster"" effect ASAP. Based comment, sounds like they're wrong exactly—there necessarily benefit getting COVID future versus now.

Or missing something?

(And again, fully support vaccines careful myself, I'm trying ot better understand much longer I'll careful change allow that.) Russian state media tried badmouth Western vaccines backfired (it sown distrust vaccines). recently Russian sociologist (for details scroll «Стратегия «только наша вакцина хорошая» дала обратный эффект»).

It random thing, strategy. Putin made dig two Western vaccines — Pfizer-BioNTech Oxford-AstraZeneca — claiming dangerous side said: ""The way prevent pandemic developing vaccination. hope prejudices among people decrease"".

Despite talk side-effects, [they CDC page suggests ~80% people get noticeable systemic side-effects, means 1 5 people get none. Agreed wanna moron risk health cool expect ppl care help you. Maybe first world countries, poor still time reach it, unfortunately. places, like Northeast, continue show degree risk aversion, mitigate risk mask wearing, mask wearing schools, numbers like UKs.

The UK nothing, all, virtually one I've seen around wearing masks, delta overcome paltry 70% vaccination rate without issue. r0 vaccination cut half vaccinations (given six months 70%), people mitigation, numbers go up.

Will lead massive deaths hospitalizations? lead significantly elevated deaths among elderly, enough winter people would rational tailor behavior times.

Absolutely tragic. aint getting till 2030. one's already complied Fox News' vaccine mandate could keep jobs? RemindMe! 1 year Wait. happened Zero Covid Strategy ? agree. could take 25 years covid weaken?? Holy crap… read “allowing widespread cases” “zero Covid policies?” Several people done don’t understand. wide gap two.

There never chance UK zero cases. It’s never considered policy part UK. registered highest number one-day coronavirus deaths infections since start pandemic Thursday scientists warn potentially infectious variant deadly Delta strain overwhelming hospitals. 
  
The government’s coronavirus information center reported **1,036 fatalities 36,339 cases** past 24 hours. 
  
Russia’s senior scientist warned earlier Thursday geneticists detected new contagious **sub-variant Delta strain coronavirus, AY.4.2,** isolated cases across country.  
Thursday’s records come nine days ahead planned nationwide “non-working” week designed stem relentless spread infections fourth wave pandemic. 
**Authorities Moscow, epicenter Russia’s Covid-19 outbreak, warned businesses capital go strict “short-term lockdown” infections continue rise,** according document seen Moscow Times. Russian government says least two months’ worth vaccine supplies left, plans manufacture **300 million doses end 2021.** 


But sold 1 billion Sputnik V worldwide, never delivered. mean believe it. lot stories start pandemic.

From exist, flu, Soros conspiracy on. yea possible. RIP 2022 Well, fuck. Well lets forget government role this. downplayed vaccine. Majority parliament dragging feet came vaccination, lot outright refused get vaccinated. 

Matovic end got vaccinated Sputnik much trouble buying it. know arguing about. Australia real. like birds. Wow Oct 20, 2021 announce that? Pretty bold statement WHO, eh? Nope weird sounds, I'm Pretty glad college state restrictions (including vaccine mandates unfortunately) illegal. nice much normal college experience friends states. know im going get ton flack, know many covid vaccines tested stem cells aborted fetal tissue. wanting get vaccine, dont want get one tested manner.

With that, said, vaccine osnt tested aborted fetal tissue, stem cells, ""immortal cell lines?"" fry fries once: get fries go limp time reach table, need fry twice. 

A trip freezer two frys make fries even crunchy. say that. It’s real safety issue. n pretending like it’s safety issue. Follow question. I'm sure answer this, half dose going every booster (including J&amp;J) booster people got Moderna. Like Pfizer J&amp;J person walked would get full dose? way religion works practice (for almost everyone) choose parts religion want follow, discard parts (it's easy make excuses following parts). 

So religion really behind this. It'sn't rare.   BioNTech boosters already approved weeks ago.  Good. Well again, we’re South Korea. sense what’s realistic really different what’s realistic here.  I’ll willing assume risk hospitals around aren’t near capacity exhausted doctors nurses treatment Covid gotten even bit better. lost vaccinated friend Covid I’m convinced would made hospital hadn’t overwhelmed. didn’t space, time, equipment treat unfortunately couldn’t fight alone. 

It’s human nature think way things way they’ll always fortunately that’s case. Vaccine rates (hopefully) go up, hospitalizations go down, drug companies fight ones best treatment, we’ll better idea prevent treat long Covid, one day we’ll pandemic parties everyone shows nice tops pj bottoms wear craziest masks we’ll talk weird hobbies tried early 2020 strange time was.  sounds lousy, I'm glad got past it. good short.

 guessing would need another less least year. third shot drives antibody level much higher people 2 shots, even guess waning rate first 6 month interval, high enough 12+ months. Also, year might changes Covid prevalence, maybe risk lower booster (if any) wait longer. could new medicines.    one ever visits SF town. Especially wharf area. 

 hey 8 10, that’s 103%, everyone must safe.  they're even going pretend try keep safe, I'm going pretend try eat there.

(Been going In-n-Out 40 years, miss it.) want booster ASAP! guess got Pfizer vaccine, Moderna booster? agree, hope I'm wrong. Yes. extremely vocal minority Let guess. American.   Nowhere America ever lockdown way countries did. Period received tons money buy vaccines, rich countries already starting donate vaccines week passing finally, **obvious** pandemic last till 2022 jabs speed donations. Honestly, depends place. places give booster whoever wants it, require tell reason (like ""I'm high risk!""), want CDC approval.  currently allow links i.ibb.co difficult verify information posted there.

Oh figured gonna endemic would need booster shots years. cares lol. wear mask. 


Look asian countires, masks super normal, know colds/flu's also really low. Unfortunately Uk hospitalisations deaths 3 times higher rest Europe theory testing cause wrong Pfizer. Yes. remember call. seems last major update age group. hoping hear next week it. would need 4th shot? I’m deciding Pfizer Moderna, leaning towards Moderna.  Moderna Phizer? Data Available Differences Full Dose Moderna Booster vs. Half Dose Booster? former smokers,

Exactly!! Go buy cigarrete ... light ... congrats! former smoker qualify. really go get it. :)  Got booster (3rd) shot yesterday. really knocked today ended sleeping whole day cause body ached over. able sleep anymore, took forever get back land living. I'm OK touch lightheadedness! What's funny reaction like first two shots. really hope whenever get 4th shot get symptoms even do, that's OK hell lot better getting Covid!  We're (at least USA) making laws 'against unvaccinated'; we're trying punish people vaccinated. laws are, opinion, least restrictive could make (because federal government is, purpose, relatively constrained). I’m going ask whatever pharmacy go Moderna dose J&amp;J mix match (standard half dose). Comment decent update, sister Russians right one. Vaccines supposed open source. way masks ever normalized way seatbelts mini skirts are. difficult, obstructive, never live full life mask. need see people’s faces communicate, need taken eat, drink, exercise.

Telling people “move” simplistic asinine argument. Lives much complicated that. 


They don’t bother you, that’s great. choose wear long want. Since I’m idiot here, lib arts degrees, would getting Moderna booster phizer shots good idea Google: “Pfizer September 2021 Morgan Stanley conference transcript” cfo says data month behind. Extrapolate hearing week since 5-11 group data release late September. Hoping approval mid December panels 5-11 group finish first week november Bro fuck making money besides billionaires rn mine go school TX

I'm sorry hear that, several biggest districts TX require masks.  going cost even along $3 million salary lost.  ""unfortunately""

I mean, probably Sputnik safer Delta protects it, Russia literally administers WHO-approved vaccine country. mean, would joyful vaccine either Headline one year now: warns pandemic drag 2023  definitely sounds like “talk doctor” question. Watch film Contagion see transmissible virus become. film life may imitate art Got 2nd shot February 

Should worried since haven’t booster shot yet ? I’m high. getting ready look kind freaks fetal sex. Fucking weirdos. wrong all, end day life always risk move one point.

Yes-ish? 'move on' seatbelts invented ... people wore long skirts 100 years ago, people wear mini skirts (and high hats! horror!).

Maybe people stop wearing masks, maybe still wear 10 years, maybe become fashion statement. bother you, move place they're mandated common (and/or change local policies/attitudes). 

Masks \*are\* normal life (as in, they're norm). see big deal (but, bother me, I'm vaccinated, anxiety normal, bother me, I'm place few/no mandates). “no” transmission virtually impossible never happen, especially America. Covid continue circulate forever. know!  Bonkers still lie. vaccine shortage. Exact situation US, except intelligent people leaving rural areas going cities. General consensus amongst who? People reddit, maybe, far tell comes study shown initial findings. results people initially received Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine particularly striking. receiving Johnson &amp; Johnson booster saw antibodies go fourfold. Switching Pfizer-BioNTech booster raised antibody levels factor 35. Moderna booster raised **Dr. Lyke cautioned drawing hasty conclusions results far. researchers hope next month they’ll know well different boosters increase cells, antibodies. It’s possible Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine shine results.**  mean…on instinctual level, want sex fit mates, right? Symmetrical, diseased ill, etc. 

And…if you’re vaccinated, you’re probably either genetically predisposed allergic many things, crazy health issues, generally lack education intelligence, content dying something else comes along.

Survival procreation fittest. Nature.   i'd say vegas dangerous majority cruise vaccinated, right? vegas rules like absolute minority, actually. getting booster regardless. F.D.A says even approval J&amp;J booster testing 17 participants, I'm going another J&amp;J booster lack information. say anyone older 18 one 2 months first shot. would choose Pfizer booster.  Since data can’t collected yet even first booster, assume rhetorical question. wait see. secondary immune responses greater durable certainly won’t need one 6 months. One year, five years, one knows. also depends goal vaccination- preventing disease severe disease. guess don’t see realistic way covid goes away, ever. restrictions last long they’re supported good majority people, see ending soon. 

I agree isn’t best-case scenario, course, probably best we’ll able manage quite time. Great advice. “Just lie.” GOP excellent job marrying conservative Christianity politics back 80s. Thus lot conservative beliefs purely political labeled deeply held religious beliefs. government positions, no.


Lots gov workers/first responders fully vaccinated disclosing status till absolutely necessary. 


""Unvaccinated"" documented vaccinated treated better vaccinated. Work home options, free weekly testing working hours, contact, get paid leave required person. course. find data VRBPAC meeting presentations Moderna FDA staff. Moderna compared antibody response booster 50 ug 100 ug wasn’t significant difference. clinical effectiveness study either, that’s required— called immunobridging study safety data. Stay home 4 months… gamers 🤷🏻 carry on? working out? significant side effects Moderna booster J&amp;J people going smoothly? BS. making states, share adults 65 older died due COVID-19 **is higher share deaths opposite…. afraid dying covid (if older higher risk) encouraged take vaccine. mandatory. also choose remain indoors limit exposure.

If wish go business regardless without vaccine, may. However die covid complications it, life insurance voided. first easy-to-use Covid-19 treatment could available United States end year, unlikely reach developing countries, hundreds millions people remain without access vaccines, least middle 2022, according public health officials  still threat long covid. letting virus freely circulate wipes everyone’s sense smell taste doesn’t seem like good idea. antibodies higher Moderna dose also high makes sense. Pfizer adequate. I’m assuming new needles dilution 5-11 also they’ll use 6mo-5, case extras delivered initial stockpiles youngest cohort. It’d stupid to. Yeah better antibody response Correct. California though. California whole tiered system counties different restrictions based bad was. Obviously populous counties like Los Angeles severe restrictions. say never “proper lockdown” ludicrous.  isn’t dumb ass getting charged felony federal forged document? sick Covid? so, minimal concern you? flu different lol. info moderna booster significantly better? got booster weekend mom waiting get Moderna (she originally Pfizer) seen anything  I’m really interested well. Dr. Leana Wen Twitter thread today it- got J&amp;J March mRNA week, side effect sore arm. Hopefully get data soon! Whatever wanna believe. making claims factual, presenting factual, goalpost shifted people feel someone else instead actually are. Single dosed 16 85% really want vote think sadly right. Technically everyone eligible booster, honor system. mark checkbox paper Walgreens that's it

Check local pharmacy. ton available appointments go it. high risk got appointment immediately, basically time slots still available. care non high risk people go get one want. Helps protect way, it'd take much effort him. Stealing killing enjoys most, he'll never cease, even face pandemic.  So, someone want get vaccine shot, take chance dying COVID every 16 months. can't imagine good body even COVID manage kill you. Bad bot Right!

Certain pubs Dublin open year, lockdown defined period required stay home nearly circumstances.  thoughts exactly. Great analogy enforcing means cutting profits. absolute nonsense. Depending place, unvaccinated people 10-30 times likely die COVID. “getting destroyed” terms efficacy? reminded every single day still stuck worst year life, spite desperate attempt move on. Lost 3 million vaccinations others struggle get paid living wage. Talk stupid prideful. No, Americans never experienced proper lockdown extent countries have. Even France curfew last October friends States still able go out. Why? ??? thought vax worked basically “Safer Home” order March 2020-January 2021. “Essential workers” always allowed work. allowed grocery store/pharmacy etc obviously. whole bunch exceptions different times different things memory correct, technically wen away bit end summer…but nothing open anyway one going anywhere still huge restrictions stuff. Jan-June 2021 still bunch restrictions. There’s still large events. There’s still mask mandate rolling needed proof vaccination lots stuff. 

I’m STILL working home allowed office 1 day week “cohorting” work pretty awesome whole thing. And? Cases minimal concern. hospitalization rates deaths? 2 Pfizer would better get Moderna booster? getting 240K from?
Worldometer 78K NYT 79K.  cruise risky. 1000%.

You housed close quarters little ventilation, difficult isolate/quarantine sick people cruise ship. top limited access medical care, especially high level care. People cruises die time preventable illnesses/diseases go missing/disappear. old still. Plus milder stuff like food poisoning.

Vegas safer. Probably expensive also probably worth Following vaccine requirements normal. students personnel required MMR, tetanus, Hepatitis, newer shots chicken pox. one thing. would fire people start hiring hiring managers new personnel. Let's move forward safe 2022 everyone people. wish waited? get Moderna? studies seem using “full” doses Moderna booster J&amp;J recipients’ second dose. get full dose Moderna second shot half dose Moderna recipients receive booster? funny ironic. goes around comes around article says could available soon weekend, CDC approve too. mean 'normal'? talking particular state? restrictions see? Without info, answer generic stuff :) 


That said, definitely go back something looks like life COVID (it look \*exactly\* like it, though). COVID stops public-health problem, places remove restrictions (I think there's one place restrictions initial lockdowns, right?). probably delay, progress choppy, remove them. might end restrictions (vax mandates, maybe masking, ventilation requirements etc)

Also, people alter behavior towards pre-COVID; again, might get way (more people work home, people prefer outdoor seating/activities) ... 


Don't despair. Things get better. fact, much better months ago. Let back bit say hospital blatantly letting workers sick covid interacting patients yes hospital would held responsible. case though, I'm fully vaxxed felt alittle ill let come back got negative test even covid symptoms. 

So agree exemptions, still say hospital completely negligent. get 4 doses believe season 8 never existed rewatch series?  CDC approve well. article, could available soon weekend. clear given authorizing half dose Moderna booster. study last week done full dose hard tell. How's good? Even helps meet demand also means demand going fall faster should.

It looks though results generated 100ml dose, far know booster 50ml. Would love someone knowledgeable shed light this.

Best luck!  Yes! mean walk get now? Thank you! That's exactly looking for. company making come office? That’s 2019. Sick weather? Same. mean go get one want today?  half-measures, unfortunately, real lockdown implemented relatively short period time. vaccine skepticism still prevails among population it’s hard believe things improve. J&amp;J’s single-shot vaccine, FDA said U.S. recipients, matter age, could get second dose least two months following initial vaccination.

This makes sound like they're talking (second) J&amp;J shot here, thus confusion. think good options. getting whichever available Friday afternoon. recover weekend side effects. Although JNJ zero side effects, hoping same. I'm boat, 40 years old. get plane TX November 1st i'm really hoping get booster then. worries. Apologies came harsh. 

Here journal article processed VSafe data two CSA still won’t accept back boxes. Dunno bags stores still can’t go due immune compromised. global pandemic already mentioned. [The kind made worse frequent climate Israel also restrictions, goes original point everyone vaccinated major way protecting vulnerable. else going it? would easy exemption card doctor rare people truly unable vaccinated.

Let's GOOOOOOOO!! donated trumps campaign several times. ever tried eat Popeyes? Yeah, much easier Israel things effectively UK. boosters clearly help - remains seen long. Yes, FDA says can!

Oh, we're 99% one dose, 90% fully vaxd, mask mandate minimal value right now. Trump: 'I rid government anyone support ordering things want do, 8 years government full supporters.'

ZERO people arrested Australia getting vaccine. may want reconsider sources information. U.S. Christian culture. almost like cult, somethin. think read article, actually said need keep masks rollout vaccines. doesn’t seem unreasonable, it? understanding kids vaccinated, probably won’t mask anymore.  act like symptom onset happen within narrow window.

 Remember Israel early year 95% efficacy? hopeful. logic beggars belief. ""I trust kind (doctors) COVID before, I'm going trust confirm *not* COVID treat accordingly"".

What waste oxygen (literally, get point).  Exactly. end. people power force face coverings people viable scientifically proven vaccine absurd. kids still sit desk fully masked surrounded plastic barriers. principal told kids might scared. bowing lunatics take shit WAY overboard. Get vaccinated vaccinate kids end masking. got second guy/senior author wrong; Ontario High School Student. Well, nook Europe mostly gave masks distancing, vaccine passports used bars want stay open late. Masks absolutely nowhere might take while, think masks public transport hospital waiting rooms stay longer, even deep 2022.  It‘s important remember like USDA, CDC gutted past years. honestly seems like lost lot effective messaging people reasons can’t really get into. Look excess mortality, looking far worse USA right now, likely due COVID. everyone think getting booster shot even healthy person? got J&amp;J 4 months ago feel like take opportunity get booster since there’s lot talk decreased immunity vaccine. honestly feel strange taking another vaccine short span time. downvoted? *is* reddit echo chamber. varies, many subs get sucked thing. family (they’re toxic! You’re perfect!), politics, etc. wild you’re downvoted pointing out. It’s something aware of. Thats 11 months second dose. supose something 20-30% efficacy maybe 2-dose? Let mask go. goodness. find wanes 6 months following booster, I'll try get Moderna booster next time. suspect Pfizer booster remain effective longer compared 2nd dose.  ""wanting"" it, sounding snide help anything. 

The whole point vaccines return normal. vaccine reduces risk hospitalization, spreading, symptoms - im pretty sure much abundantly clear. turns incredibly dangerous virus moderately dangerous virus. true? 

So, since none parents seem give shit kids, I? We're protected get, think comfortable level risk. school gets hit outbreak i'll easily go back wear masks. then....yeah effectively over. masks actually work? Look stats. Vaccinated wave vs pure mask wave. I'm saying DONT numbers say do. feel like need dedicated sub. friends unvaccinated kids keep wanting playdates. desperately want 2 year old play little unknown friends. would forgive caught let guard down.  appreciate vigilance, fellow parent also trying vigilant protect kid. common??

Communities willing make small sacrifices good neighbors. end game herd immunity, 85% antibodies vaxxed Delta. Oregon’s going reach December thanks high rates vaccination last outbreak. end game probably going boosters development new treatments, seem like we’re headed there. It’s important give reach goal backsliding happens. extremely dangerous attitude. Remember May, everyone started feeling like COVID finally way out, Delta pop flood hospitals more? COVID-19 extremely adaptable virus, question ""will breakthrough variant"" ""will able effectively vaccinate enough people breakthrough variant emerges"". Humans incubators virus, long people getting sick, virus evolving spokesman saying. San Francisco restaurant closed violating mandate.

Did restaurants check vaccination status patrons, burger chain singled out? Lol IFR much higher 0.2%. 0.22% Americans died due covid, there's way every single American already gotten covid. I'm still waiting Deaths - Causes come down. I'm sure what's RI CT, everything else Northeast US headed wrong direction. Numbers % Expected Deaths Month per virus going around like Flu. people don’t get flu vaccine people wont get covid vaccine. agree that. Masking become whole ""personal choice"" thing anti-vaxxers like screech about.

The irony prior pandemic, face masks forbidden lot public spaces, presumably anti-crime measure. see happening long time. heard thing given enough time monkey would able type Shakespearean play? It’s simple probability- given enough chances mutate virus mutate directions produce new variants weak disappear fast others strong transmit effectively. Yeah seriously. Get vaccinated thing. pretty much sentiment pushed CDC fallback March 2020 suggestions. gonna push people past fence start recognizing people want hear. Vaccinations work... showing goal line mask removal...it's nothing. know there's way tell said goal line is. I'm 2x Moderna 1x j&amp;j. worn mask public since may NJ. wait time nothing.

Not mention look damn stats.... fully masked wave vs vaccinated wave. masks *actually* work terms pure numbers? I'm sure years we'll know. correct. We're still pandemic phase, moving endemic, people mistake endemic mean ""exactly like pandemic, permanent"". child home cannot vaccinated yet.  It’ll likely individual thing. Plenty countries mask flu season sick, I’d lying said hadn’t considered continuing wear one pollen/fire season here. know antidotal friends live Omsk, COVID everyone last months. Pretty crazy. got feeling conversations precautions really thing. say falls ""false sense security"" category along checking temperatures. Testing expensive let know infected late. problem vaccine supply. enough doses vaccinate whole population 2 times probably, nobody wants take it. Interesting. That's crazy median time since last dosage. I'm assuming trial started June/July. would mean half people fully vaxxed July/August last year. that's case good news.  aren't... ""Masks temporary measure, think otherwise, nutjob conspiracy theorist!"" 

Voluntary masking might good idea, mask *mandates* end soon possible. end game? know everyone get vaxxed likely reach herd immunity. mask forever? death rates rookie numbers US. Sure does, perfect show infection faster testing e.g. week. feel like point deniers accepting reality required pandemic end, us service make sure people always know covid. many people thinking eh, probably before, can't get now. real all. major universities state vaccination rate planning ease restrictions cases reach safe level. school systems something like 93% vaccination rate among staff. reach herd immunity state December.  sub worst. Full nutters posting nonsense. It’s little bit like China suddenly shutting city almost 12 million people back January 23, 2020. 

Like China spreading impossible contain. led improvements Bulgarias low vaccination-rate? CDC stated, beginning vaccine roll public spaces enforce masks significant proportion population vaccinated.

They seem realized this. ""personal"" freedom compel people improve society  See 2025 Sorry, bad. Everything previously vaccines ""FDA emergency-use authorization"" thought yesterday was. figure we’ll wait new year let kids gonna vaccinated get vaccinated (plus time vaccines reach full effect), we’re fully back. 

I haven’t eaten inside restaurant since March 2020. can’t wait go back favorite Mexican place, maybe go across street see movie. Get popcorn even though I’m full. Stop beer poured someone else head home. 

Modest goals, sure. True patriots part protect fellow citizens.

“Muh freedoms” crybabies like think patriots they’re really traitors cowards. 2080: New variant become sentient, displays malevolent intent. also happened rescind right beginning delta great metric know moving goalposts take meme pretty true lot places. Covid zero always far-fetched somehow clung *more* obvious becomes impossible goal. Good. fewer people exposed anti-vaxxers, better. Naw I’m unofficial caregiver uncle, able get vaxxed early year due that. I’m apparently qualified get one well, though I’m sure actually need one. Hopefully CDC meeting tomorrow give info this. Johnson colossal dickhead. always was, always be. I've honestly got idea UK got stage he's Prime Minister, matter bad gets seems like that's changing time soon. beyond pissed off. Covid Sigma variant Meanwhile, everything else Australia continues try kill human population.  fries taste like cardboard anyway.   Many colleges vaccine mandate numbers offer interesting insights. publish limited stats helpful. Facts. Wow, someone called 311 service line report this. Like wtf, seriously worried go there. like fast food chain going take seriously. Someone could walk door show copy friend's card they'd never know. Hell, someone could probably flash random white card 17 year old kid checking vaccine cards they'd let want deal shit. 

Bottom line, going fast food dining area, mandate not, expect unvaccinated covid positive people there. Evangelicals often anti-government streak, since ostensibly separation church state makes salty. government tells something, they'll opposite. remember Pfizer similar study, believe 30's 40's infection. 50% infection scenario pretty impressive. 84% symptoms mind-blowing!  Really, both. Waning antibodies function immune system, less vaccines. would happening matter variant. 

Delta infects transmits much faster previous variants greater affinity cell binding replication, means need higher number antibodies mount pre-infectious defense. So, course going infect people sooner following vaccination schedule. 

If still dealing original strain, we'd find protection lasting longer. antibodies would wane different rate, despite waning, people would still adequate levels infection threshold. efficacy nice even importantly getting onto vaccine wider adoption. I'm tired waiting longer find results research there's smaller pool recipients study. California towns near natural attractions sort place. (Which towns here, nature everywhere). one hand rural, large number environmentalists mountain hippies strongly liberal moved close nature. pure agriculture towns middle irrigated desert often red though. Wondering too. 33, serious health conditions I'm adjunct teacher 70+ not-in great-health parents currently live me. Hmm. us got J&amp;J able get 2 shots Pfizer / Moderna single booster? tried hard avoid little ones mine go school TX one wears mask. ended Covid. Still can’t wait shot girls avoid severe complications continually exposed Covid school. Australia's government, conservative, introduced new plan called “No Jab, Pay.” means vaccinate get government welfare benefits. controversial plan. Almost 40,000 Australian children seven vaccinated parents refuse. means lot families lose imposes penalties anti-vaxxers** man, literally hit six months past second moderna dose Friday, desperate get booster thanksgiving (not necessarily thanksgiving, I’ve got big trip weeks severely pissed COVID takes away me). *Very* excited development. That's paper talking about, mistaken (I think unevenly spaced grid system threw comparing data points different lines without realizing it). edit previous comment. Thanks. Ouch Fantastic news.

They going make recommendation mixing matching, probably least one combination: J&amp;J people mix match.

Personally I'm Pfizer go Moderna if/when I'm eligible, Pfizer probably fine too. us, biggest thing masks. people, it’s vac requirements couldnt care less that.

For lot us cities mask mandates, feels like nonstop daily reminder, it’s frustrating there’s information it’s going end.

I feel like covid feel completely get plane without mask. say women, there's guy planet sticking guns motivated partner. J&amp;J absolutely approved. brought way shots peoples' arms low Moderna Pfizer supply. already great vaccine, ones even better. Considering nearly 100% students vaccinated certain college campuses still severe restrictions them, know clear ramp this. Ok, call there's outbreak another virus we're vaccinated that's deadly. believe you’re boosting J&amp;J Moderna get full 100ug. Everything read makes sound like half dose 3rd shot Moderna, mix match booster J&amp;J.  Linguisticoligist here!

Oregon. Mask mandate stronger ever. expect last probably March/April 2022 come back around late summer/fall. Rinse repeat every year indefinitely.  yeah... result seems obvious, least showing immune systems still react vaccine. 

I'd still like see booster efficacy results 6-12 months. far exception. used work bank pandemic, confirm weird! SC. Fully vaccinated April worn mask since May unless I'm doctor's office. Quarantines still problem school getting better. cases dropping lot immunity now, though wish many people get hard way. I'm glad subject severe restrictions able socialize normally. NRA happy.

3. Profit! Hard find good qualified people valley. Hopefully employee’s expense.  Well, that's expected. There's completely different reason need gun Alaska, vs California. clarification: (from article)

""These first results randomized, controlled Covid-19 vaccine booster trial, companies said, reflect period highly contagious Delta variant prevalent""

Also, stats are:

Test done people, age 16yo
Median time since full vaccination 11 months

From people got placebo 109 got sick COVID vs 5 people got sick, got booster Still prefer today, least back couls still hope future. Thanks! couple epidemiology blogs follow already said difference Moderna/Pfizer antibody counts small significant, also gave warning said antibodies whole story regard immune response. new real world efficacy study feels compelling theoretical. can't vaccinated, get tested.  
It's like can't transmit covid health conditions prevent getting vaccine.  
how undue burden? real question long vs many variants. still vanilla virus vaccine, right? thought whole advantage mRNA vaccines ability quickly adapt new strains.., Damn, cases UK blowing up. Brits hope mask up, wash hands regularly, avoid crowds stay home much possible.

Americans, too. know delta wave supposed wane 6,000 people died past three days. COVID-19 going nowhere.   mean, clearly platform   cannot imagine able go daily life without mask. Maybe 2023 I’ll able know that’s like.  really have. Even countries like Japan everything right still cases. pathology infection means nearly impossible. Throw developing world way. variant “Delta plus” UK another one? article mentions England clear point. I'm sure lose close one due COVID19, considering tone comment.  Nah, we're going back lockdown whole state again. They'll targeted lockdowns small outbreak areas

We'll 80% fully vaxxed week 2.5 month booster I'd interested know is. spend good amount time MA, RI, NH, see completely opposite, even mandates place. alot sympathy school administrators trying craft policies something polarizing. There's really way walk minefield make ""head scratcher"" rules. 1/3 people want act like never problem 1/3 want us shut whole place down...it cant easy. 

Hope shes ok employee refuses follow safety guidelines gets fired, business refuses follow pandemic safety guidelines expects forgiven based excuse boils ""we're lazy."" Classic. True, (J&amp;J) get Moderna booster. immune system response effectiveness based antibody levels. isn’t low risk scenario. It’s real possibility yeah, hotels tourist cities+food easily $300 night. Even modest ones. vast majority people resumed international travel. Can't believe get de funded yet. Hacks. next variant's (delta derivative) already wild countries like UK. said 10-15% transmissible delta variant itself. Even we're past said peak, would need potent variant fuel another wave like second one hit May. Delta 116% potent original virus. get long study lasted. I'd interested know many months study followed booster. seems pretty clear effectiveness regards neutralizing immunity slowly declines time two dose regimen. want know holds true booster. Yes, religiously. Even outdoors masks probably 75% people. Maybe live. hasn’t followed normal flu metrics live. It’ll interesting see lock endemic virus spreads past lockdown. Yes, come point eventually. measures, think we're getting pretty soon. We'll likely vaccines 5+ years weeks, sounds like maybe months see availability 6+ months. point, think good. 6 months decent time sorta back away much life take carefully kid eligible. way, many parents already much time. Many moms quit work. Dads take leave. large portion society, even return office, suspect common variety leave + virtual 6 months clear. even may unnecessary. believe I've read research suggesting vaccination pregnancy confers immunity child. may easiest workaround.

HOWEVER....

Unfortunately, long still stories people able find ICU bed hospital 5 closest states, think we've reached point measures. feel overburdening hospitals soon last measure dictating long goes for. point, irony power end lie entirely hands people desperate end it, least willing take appropriate steps. want reward, without work goes it. point, going matter long takes enough get infected mostly naturally acquired immunity burden hospitals becomes negligible. predictions timeframe.  would ended pandemic year earlier Vaxxed still spread like crazy??

The reality Western world refuses move meet completely untenable goal zero Covid. Pandemic ends realize matter COVID remain lives like Flu does.

Move fuck already. Hotels 300 unless staying Sheraton travel always involves risks. get passport stolen even problems. kind low risk scenario scares ever traveling that's prerogative understand vast majority people moved lives. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Peak humanity  hospitals coping increase cases? mean, infections mostly mild, albeit many, high vaccination rate? Nice false equivalence. plenty data show highly vaccinated areas experiencing deaths Covid rate unvaccinated areas. evidence Covid deaths mislabeled something else, none. 

You're simply taking random statistic context trying use support kind alternative point Covid, literally evidence two anything one another. 

Now want go crusade figure happening, go ahead, use actual data rather nonsense conspiracy theory. That’s pretty bad worst case. 10 unexpected days $300 night hotel food+plane tickets. It’s $5,000 gamble I’m going take. Go Russia, show USA real lockdown looks like. course does. It’s vaccine showed effectiveness before. vaccinated, it'll like flu. Worst case, rent hotel 10 days better. Also, plenty countries dropping test req fly. US dropping 3 weeks even catch it, go back home. 2nd. impression got TWIV podcast broke recent results Depends workplace. Mine vaccine requirements we're 100% vaccinated. Ergo, mask mandate place. mandate, masks would required.   wear mask. Nothing well nothing whole. Come already. I’m scared getting trapped overseas get positive test. There’s way get around current testing requirement reentering US. think thing - preventing death severe disease vs returning normal. Lol I've traveled 10 times internationally. scared leaving house, doesnt mean rest us think like you. plane Italy packed full. airport frankfurt bursting. International travel recovered lot. People queuing many places trying get vaccinated. Otherwise cannot work places.



It must clarified decision implement measure taken 2 days ago. communicated population that. never knew possibility measure implemented. comes bad surprise many time react prepare.




I hope lead significant increase vaccination rates. top it, current temporary government plans create obligation civil servants teachers vaccinated, giving 4 weeks so. We're talking ~ 200 000 people.  Australia definitely has, live there. Nz matter time, guarantee hundreds daily cases within month, uncontainable . 'other countries ' tiny Pacific islands something? article predates big rise delta, changed game worldwide.

If think going live somewhere safe sorely mistaken. whole world battling decades, even centuries, like common cold flu. part fabric Honestly, think meant malicious intent. trying convey small number compared total number deaths country. It’s relative guess. quick search see Texas getting 180 deaths day tragic. fuckin way! Surprised pikachu face Yeah it’s climbing snails pace. Like .1% day still doesn’t count 11 age group.

In places like Northeast 70% population vaccinated, small remnants protocols, mostly surrounding education healthcare institutions. Mask mandates scattered low compliance, constant pressure looming daily fear dissipated. result people mostly moved on. 

In places vaccination rates low, relatively high deaths cases done little move needle regards public sentiment. Protocols restrictions far between, people seem fine resulting fallout. result people largely moved on. 

I'm sure else expecting here. Barring real breakthrough variant think general sentiment people it, regardless lingering risks. better! hardest part admitting needed help :) opens back world hope vaccination rate high. alternative grim. feel ashamed we’re going looked back history books like “remember time humanity could ended pandemic least year earlier worked together, couldn’t even that?” Surging north summer too. right take medical advice Reddit. Stop talking ass. cut dose half reduce effectiveness. basically line initial vaccination level efficacy. Kind points need ongoing 6 month boosters. university students 98% vaccinated still mask mandate.   Triggered surge cases. electrical circuit breaker cuts power senses overload, ""circuit breaker"" measure triggers cases hit critical level. got 3rd shot first trimester. Might able get booster 3rd tri better passive immunity transfer.

But data long passive immunity works COVID vaccines yet. Could 6 weeks could 6 months. that's going rough months family wanting visit. People radicalized believe infringement liberties.  “Really well” using draconian tactics aren’t possible country. Again, one speak specific circumstances workplace.  It’s interesting question disabled employees allowed reasonable accommodation. idea applies you. I've New York City times, huge fan. said, probably safest place country COVID-wise right now. assume include neurotoxin development. all, would suspicious everyone disagreed state fell windows. real reason expect happen US. Infections declining, vaccinations slowly increasing, new worrisome strain threaten that.   Come NYC, use issue. countries moving beyond that, even ones still restrictions. Thanks vaccines, live like complete hermits keep COVID control let anyone tell otherwise. account majority cases, hospitalizations, deaths. way handling now. Vaccination requirements, aggressive testing forced isolation positive cases, movement tracking control, mandatory quarantine isolation, strict border controls, etc.

Not support approach it’s effective.  absolutely peak vaccination, least US.   Sorry removed! I'm arguing driving social risk, I'm saying COVID-19 good comparison target terms consequences mitigating associated risks.

I think relevant (though entirely fictional) example would car defect could spread cars within ""proximity"". One \*could\* increase chances car malfunctioning not, cars showing symptoms issue others ever heard notion micromort?

I have, feel like large topic properly elaborate (here least), talking COVID-19. looking spectrum responses disease, locality, region, state/province even country would give vastly difference values.

So end, prevention measures think lift, how/when/where (etc) it, define ""acceptable"" risk levels so. *Correction: 85% businesses a.) still using Yelp reported status “temporarily closed” open again, b.) suffering massive losses, c.) “open” likely operating well pre-Covid revenues. 

Not meant downer it’s disingenuous cherry-pick positive aspect treacherous 2 years businesses. Maybe sent kids back school approved vaccines them? required pay full cost tests well.  This. people put fear beyond reality say things like guy said. No. Parts Asia wear masks commonly symptoms higher risk areas. culture, least recent history, forced people wear masks permanently anytime public entirely life, that's actually quite insane, people actually want now.  want talk Asia, kinds social isolation policies help lockdowns actually big problems Asia COVID even arrived. want talk good Asia, lets talk bad parts well. whole young culture people committing suiciding higher rates, declining birth rates, depression, even extreme isolation cultures like hikikomori Japan young men never live room believed hundreds thousands now.  evolved see faces, socially distant, live like this. vaccinated, bad outweighs good measures, take account everything, health factors, sociological factors, psychology, economical issues. way live, need realize hope sooner rather later.  Life risky, worth risk live fear. They're constantly moving goal posts. Like said they'll get gets full FDA approval. Pfizer receives full FDA approval say quick. start vaccination program germany, care workers ended 5 x dose accident injected vaccine straight vial without diluting first. 

Best extra safe around kids otherwise one mistake like one germany parents everywhere screaming vaccination program halted. saying state media letting anyone else say otherwise Maybe people sarcastic vaccinated? think covid real soo friends work Google campus mostly open fully vaccinated work hopefully prior infection vaccine offer protection.
