0,2021-04-18," Imagine actually thinking 6 I'm either. Probably freeze -100 degrees useless dollars? exported vaccines free. wish got useless dollars. seem unnecessary dickhead think there's major difference demand flu vaccine compared covid vaccine, flu pandemic shuts entire world down. Rog, thanks brother They’re saying assumption people would travel internationally vaccine probably wealthy enough afford jacked-up price. they’re suggesting using profits vaccine sales donate free vaccines global poor don’t privilege/opportunity travel vaccine. 

So it’s jacking prices insulin... unless Canada suddenly decided take profits Americans buying insulin Canada use give poor people free insulin. Yes he’s saying we’ve conditioned negativity pandemic lifestyle struggle adjust optimism normality Probably couple months lifted. make sense one vaccinated places world banned, rest world little vaccines go please US. true couple weeks believe. 100M two weeks ago 50% 18 population. You:
  Oh interesting, curious! actual model amount doses administered many doses delivered then? first dose adults wants first dose 100% adult population? EU produced many Vaccines 
as US difference actually shipped vaccines different countries. EU plenty vaccine manufacturing take care themselves. 2.73 Lakh = 273,000 divide week's cases last week's cases (or 7-day rolling average, really need look full weeks avoid weekend reporting issues) exponentiate 5/7 (for 5-day serial interval). online web site gonna anything different better : (159/241)^\(5/7\) = : (68150/70160)^\(5/7\) = 5/7 part really anything; looking week-over-week growth gives exponential rate weekly basis instead 5-day basis. want figure many vaccinations need get certain level actual R value we'd want know. 5.0 day serial interval remains best estimate I've seen.

Israel's R slowly rising. US pretty flat, case numbers might unduly low today snowstorms (even looking full-week averages can't solve smoothing problems holidays storms). surprises me, it’s good hear. I’m happy you! Hope amazing time together! shit takes come sub for. Why? plenty stuff Alaska. Unless you’re implying something else. Last summer think restrictions could last 2021, are.

I'm starting think restrictions never end unless people literally refuse comply them. Uhhh...can actually find something indicates that? US-Canada. month behind US vaccinations. 
We slow start sure. 
But looking adults first end June. 36 degrees today. happy masks done  Removing J&amp;J vaccine market terrible decision. (Office reference two pictures here) Looks like numbers saw Israel 50% vaccinations. weeks you’re effectively done mates.   Premiums vary age location, that's *it*. gender, pre existing conditions, health, vaccinations anything else. Making reopening dependent vaccine hesitant sounds like horrible idea.

Once supply significantly outpaces demand, reopen. Tell everyone, ""Hey reopen 3 weeks. Go Walgreens get shot now, don't. decision."" don’t real. want narrative control CDC website Apparently one bars near opened dj dancing double mask ? u gotta shitting me. make triple fuck it. lets lynch people masks. yeah ! lynch all! can't wait much. Hospitalizations fact, up.  Sure, less before, every wave starts increase right now. Time tell vaccination effort curb new wave. Assuming they're uninsured, yes. know times places near me. like flash buying gpus, long queue. mean, often feel like need full disinfectant bath Walmart visit...and pandemic. India ~6% population 65 years age. That's less 100 million people. Great, start see effect hospitalizations. states hospitalizations going up, need better keeping restrictions place. feel bad people India Brazil don’t access vaccine like do. lucky...I read babies dying India. Heartbreaking People neighborhood walk dogs. Dogs estimated able test 250 people hour. course need rest could multiple dogs working shifts. know 6 months super long, bit times reminding people shots going arms Pfizer Moderna 6 months now, J&amp;J soon.

The J&amp;J pause may cause hesitancy. shall see. Pfizer applied FDA approval give vaccine children young 12. FDA responded request yet. 

I wonder FDA waiting for? like me. first twelve hours like ""I'm fine!!!!!"", bed shaking almost two full days. 

Have ibuprofen drinks ready go. Worst case end needing them. Minnesota measles outbreak 2017. think got better public education/messaging vaccines. Could part it! Thanks letting everyone know pandemic over. people already it, even actually yet. Well can't give actual date.  provide metrics ok, people asking exact date zero clue works. Vaccine chats hot right now.

Someone /r/Orlando created spreadsheet listing options area keep handy. Sat bartender Friday walked lost found appt worked schedule.

Checked today far ""punched arm"" effects.

Thus far, around here, everyone know early 20s getting it.

A lot preferring idea J&amp;J ""one done"" pickup faster, far everyone's happy ""the best vaccine first one get"" final mentality. talking USA - NED - CAN? US Canada they're probably around month behind (Canada). NL Canada similar think. Netherlands 50% adult population first dose mid-May, milestone US passed. that's exactly month difference. thought Canada similar EU terms deliveries coming months.

I know Canada uses pretty extreme 1-dose strategy, Netherlands uses stretched 2-dose strategy (4 weeks Moderna, 6 weeks Pfizer 12 weeks AZ). change first dose : fully vaccinated ratio. Everybody leaving every city per internet That's said... Wait...   are. working boosters already vaccinated potentially changing initial cover variants Well know 16 can’t get don’t need broken top several studies show amount spread caused asymptomatic infections likely extremely low. 

Whether sub likes debate informally closed vaccinations prevent spread covid. scientific community needs cross Ts dot Is. positivity rate daily new cases per capita increased Tarrant county since 4/5 (the day Ranger opened full capacity). 

Daily new cases per 100k population steady decrease low 5.6 cases per 100k population. 10.3 cases per 100k. 

Positivity rate 5.4% 4/5 increased 6.4%. 

It prove opening baseball cause uptick, show noticeably uptick cases recent weeks.  problem explicitly state plan framework “permanence” rules repealed. live Oregon, far away Portland Eugene, tell absolute refusal OHA ever propose target metrics removal restrictions contributed great deal people area completely disregarding pandemic rules altogether. hear over. one people sticking masking occupancy rules (until family vaccinated) point literally know one couple even remotely conscious rules. refusal create exit metrics also dramatically increased vaccine apathy, since people don’t really see getting vaccinated change anything better. problem OHA created messaging rules absolute risk-averse people society, leading otherwise influenceable people “middle” roll eyes stop paying attention altogether. point it’s really kind moot OHA OSHA choose out, they’ve already lost room. interest effectively managing pandemic encouraging vaccination, it’s absolutely essential start putting carrots good behavior instead stick stick bad behavior. Relatively. 30 years adenovirus research data, know side effects risks well. vaccine technology use years, never rolled scale before. Yeah, unfortunately (/fortunately) friends lovely responsible people wanna break rules. I'm already vaxxed reasons, oould like around get vaxxed ASAP think COVID vax different.  hope so. Blank Vaccine cards selling online now. Anecdotal, 2 friends around 24 25 chomping bit get vaccinated. Worked local link resources go list pharmacies find appointments mesh schedules.

And FEMA site moving back offering first dose J&amp;J pause, I'm hoping see Central FL numbers tick even next week. Yeah, think many cases that's true –– area, instance, mask mandate strongly followed social pressure enforcement basically see anyone wearing mask public (I've never seen anyone go maskless store). People upset it, begrudgingly perception absolutely –– give excuse though, I'll bet anything they'll drop them. .... *waves afar mexican* pandemic over. vaccinated good defense virus require 70% people either fully vaccinated and/or natural immunity reach herd immunity. getting closer still many cases couple hotspots around country. Many people false sense security vaccinated trust someone hot spot already know couple people fully vaccinated got covid. clinical trials also conducted control group vaccinated group followed social distancing mask wearing guidelines. vaccinated people decide take precautions efficacy rate fall compared unvaccinated (and non immune) people take precautions. problem explicitly state plan framework “permanence” rules repealed. live Oregon, far away Portland Eugene, tell absolute refusal OHA ever propose target metrics removal restrictions contributed great deal people area completely disregarding pandemic rules altogether. hear over. one people sticking masking occupancy rules (until family vaccinated) point literally know one couple even remotely conscious rules. refusal create exit metrics also dramatically increased vaccine apathy, since people don’t really see getting vaccinated change anything better. problem OHA created messaging rules absolute risk-averse people society, leading otherwise influenceable people “middle” roll eyes stop paying attention altogether. point it’s really kind moot OHA OSHA choose out, they’ve already lost room. interest effectively managing pandemic encouraging vaccination, it’s absolutely essential start putting carrots good behavior instead stick stick bad behavior. Correct. trial paused, since cases among 30,000, deemed spurious event trial resumed. is... getting bit dumb. There's information stronger stronger consensus building vaccinated people spread disease incredibly reduced rate (massively reduced chance catch massively reduced chance infect others top it), that's coming top simple common sense shit work - ""scientific common sense"" (if thing) vaccines work, also social common sense, incentivizing people get shot. he's ""hinting"" they're going walking back recommendation they're getting information.

I'm saying bad science. 100% trust Fauci one best we've got science, also trust always make careful, conservative predictions recommendations. He's extremely consistent he's ""wrong"". think someone else handling messaging lot more, moving little faster confirm people pretty much already know. There's building evidence like months pointing direction probably need restrict fully vaccinated, nothing material contrary. think article probably said half 18+ year olds gotten first dose, US reached milestone. scar smallpox. one. Yeah that's lot people hesitant. cold messing brains lol. even mean lmfao Yeah, engaging heated arguments really forte begin with—in fact, invest great deal time energy using tactful approach possible order win people line thinking. I'm process typing email explaining think best everyone vaccinated earliest opportunity. ""personal reason"" case achieving herd immunity quickly possible. part. 👍 US opened land Border México really wouldnt surprised least million mexicans went US get shot first weeks thought must need say publicly people hear it... Like I'm always know like people barely watch news hate vaccines either. needed get vaccine hang friends might higher chance it. mammoths died Covid since pandemic started either people would lie kind people would straight refuse wear mask jackassery likely near perfect circle kind moot argument make. selfish pieces crap kept people needed money live getting it. cheated government also stole neighbors. There’s special place hell waiting them. I'm eager 4 year old eligible they've done science stuff figure what's safe her. know lower risk due age, starting school year want able go places without fear, like time. Doctors notes ridiculous. goes doctor cold? waste time? yet, cold, nobody wants cold... work food service... can’t stay home? mean... still huge concern parents children 12 variants actively spreading. understand trying say. showed 10 minutes early, probably took 5 minutes door actual vaccine administration, 15 minute wait. 100 people big room including workers, good distancing. account allowed stay eBay 2 weeks? large number people know got Covid (including mom) got co-worker came sick. I’m talking “had Covid asymptomatic”. I’m talking coming actual symptoms. mom caught co-worker congested, figured cold. mom “Well, even it’s cold, still don’t want it!” idiot gives Covid 63 year old mother (she fine). 

I feel like pushing messaging staying home even think it’s cold would helped far standing little designated circles store. many people heads Covid always super severe vast majority simple cold symptoms, exacerbated spread substantially. That's really point. statistics wrong. 19.1% Georgians fully vaccinated, we’ll 30% least one dose. goes southern states cherry picked. still lagging states like New York, it’s dramatic difference made seem.

And considering Southern states feature large numbers African Americans conservative whites, shouldn’t surprise. Maybe they’ll catch eventually, though. 0 chance Pakistan's daily deaths anywhere near low.

None. places, it’s think it’s cool makes us tough can’t afford miss work work doesn’t provide enough time off. Well already 50% adults receiving least one dose opened adults today, assume 50% received first dose finish vaccination. 65+ age group around 80%, far thought would get vaccinated boomers stubborn group. think get well 60% adults vaccinated. guess somewhere 70% range adults easy. say, vaccines approved EUA, businesses, travel, colleges, hospitals start requiring vaccines. want elective surgery? vaccinated. want go Europe, vaccine proof please. Cruise, COVID vaccine (you'll probably get norovirus tho, cause cruise ships nasty, lol).

I also theory. people vaccinating pandemic still going mostly control here, news politics 24/7. Folks wanting political reasons start getting vaccinated slowly doctors, family members, etc. start telling vaccinated. Minus crazy anti-vax people. people trust doctors sat honest conversation vaccine, think get vaccinated. Yes post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Fine first hand approximation real world complicated.  First wave surprisingly well handled. initial complete lockdown definitely helped. Though numbers still seem reported testing general slow overall affect close second wave.

In first wave 3 people know got infected. circles maybe 30 2 acquaintances dead. unfortunate situation. Students ideally allowed reschedule sick, usually doctor's note. rescheduled exam means professor twice work.

This happens sometimes anyway get students end absent bigger reasons. allow students call sick reschedule exam note basically means 100% time professor need prepare 2 exams.

And happens call sick rescheduled date?

It like going work takes delay work finding someone else cover. professor can't give student exam, come totally new one session. think majority people would care voluntary. antimaskers forced mask wearing. Without question , age cohort potential large denominator think Michigan Ohio are. know plenty people Michigan went Ohio vaccinations Michigan opened up. Lots people vaccinated never plan be. folks carry risk creating mutations cause vaccine. Im living life fear free sure seems like big risk vaccine fearing folks. It’s late, already decided guy Oxford going come sneeze them. 50% one dose 16 honestly terrible sub. Last fall half comments gloating badly america terrible america people deserve die high numbers. Meanwhile now, someone brings fact everyone denies ever happened. toxic, doomersub somehow also way casual doom predictions. Reinfections possible extensively documented, rare far. 

A recent study basically showed around 20% healthy young adults could get reinfected within short time span (like 6 months) first infection. Even Fauci says he'd comfortable dropping masks social distancing get 10k cases per day. he's ALWAYS overly cautious. time infrastructure (super awesome freezers) need current round mRNA vaccines make shipping less fortunate countries untenable.

That's true. ebola vaccine requires similar cold chain solutions, solved chinese freezer company making portable, insulated GPS enabled dry ice cooler country ""cap out"" somewhere 50-60% adults vaccinated

Given we're already 50% adults vaccinated, find hard believe less 10% unvaccinated adult Americans remaining want get vaccine. always adjust behavior based risk.

If you’re data-driven, what’s probability death debilitation covid caught indoor restaurant?

Since claim adjust behavior based risk data, adjusted avoid restaurants, must quantitative answer this. want continue stupid selfish, that’s them. Stay home. punish others selfish stupidity. AstraZenica publicly kicked out, 15m J+J doses drain, nothing. need time machine. That's absurdly reductionist. they'd rather get people sick, think they'll get it. Minor quibble, news articles seems like lockdown started 18th (merely announced 13th), necessarily invalidates points. Well reducing denominator another way reach herd immunity. downstream effects india collapsing enormous

I predict whole lot systems going customer support completely unreachable. Agree. 80% highest age bracket already it. think we’ll see bit less cooperation 50s upper 40s crowd, think part, we’ll get 70% everyone else. it’s like kids never getting it. do, they’ll easily push us herd aren’t already. Omw get 2nd pfizer rn Even Fauci saying it'll likely age group (12-15) gets September he's always overly conservative. know we'll see 12 year. get everyone else high percentage guess that's huge concern. cdc still study gun violence...duh slept like 12 hours next day (on top full night's sleep), took decent naps (2-3 hours) day of, two days too.

I'm OP, 30 hours days sounds right  fearful. cautious considerate fact still spread Covid. words, think ourselves. Imagine that. truly hope correct... maybe bit timing. I’m getting worried much problem vaccine hesitancy going rural areas. Thanks. Eventually good data risk presented. always adjust behavior based risk. dad's friend test case. Please keep us updated! Think different definition young adult, I'm talking 20-30 year old crowd. seen lot statistics group currently polling least likely get vaccine. think worry many group already begun return pre-covid ""normal"", likewise rest country moving direction whole anyway, may feel there's real point getting vaccine point we're already ""coming it"" regardless. definitely many age group jumping get vaccine including vast majority friends, however think lot super enthusiastic people likely already gotten first dose point depending state in. similar lot age group, least anecdotal experience, point last year developed mild covid symptoms never got tested general apathy. nice map future COVID hotspots know avoid traveling remainder year, least. Eligible able get different. worse getting ps5 lol Like Walgreens censored email did? hope not. EAGERLY await end mandatory masks. pre-pandemic, people freaked presence leper saw someone wearing one. hope elderly want wear mask market people around coughing hacking, we'll okay it. Perhaps I'm optimistic human tendencies, though.

I like Aquabats Reddit vulgar, hence name :-). Fauci others cautious messaging double whammy making people scared they're safe making people think vaccine useless. would think shit work following people say it! don’t insurance. That’s bill insurance company administration possible. posted worldometers link original comment, don’t know got taken whatever reason, cases still dropping. nothing ending it

Because people wear masks want get vaccinated socially distance. People idiots prolonging thing. 

NONE key numbers past month: infections, hospitilizations deaths. 

And Fauci said get 20k infections day, lot easier handle things. Habits hard break. science shows vaccines extremely effective. time trust science resume normal life soon everyone chance vaccinated, 6 weeks (Memorial day). need politicians start laying short term plan end mask mandates &amp; lift restrictions. 

We also need push back fearmongers u/Real-life. lockdowns fact work incredibly well needed

When draconian, tightly control entry points area locked down. kind things calling ""lockdowns"" CA, I'm skeptical worth trouble. formula herd immunity is

1-1/r0

Where r0 reproductive rate virus. 

That means changes time, based much virus spreading moment.

That's it, viral spread. entire family Benares, Patna, Delhi including parents. Everyone saying much worse first wave deadly too, think it’s spread faster people seeing lives first time lot times. wave like January US 60% folks know got it. hope family, American citizens, able come back travel blocked. doubt parents caring grandma sick (non covid reasons). hopefully brother come back start college fall. Hopefully parents don’t die either. Eh. would thought...you bring people enclosed space airborne virus shocker....it spreads... s/ mask **** up. got second dose weeks ago. Absolutely packed little regard distancing actually going get shot. room full people hours end probably isn’t safe, even distanced us.

This definitely dependent go. first shot area like second shot Rite Aid. chicago teachers union still fighting vaccinating kids force 100% person learning, causes lot meltdowns usual suspects. Lol, teachers union officially ignored board members allowed even ask questions board members. got vaccine follow email Walgreens noticed word Covid 19 censored, anyone know why? That's wonderful. aware development. Hope accelerate serums production output actually tried sign morning, reason state add slots till noon. guess sign then. Yeah, risk low, big enough denominator still get enough cases fill hospital. include 16-17 well washington think california included 16-17  problem is, people usually call sick fever.

My neurotic friends, ones hadn’t seen since Covid started, came fully vaccinated. used get sick 2-3 times year mostly fellow employees kids kids (walking Petri dishes ie Typhoid Marys Marks) would get sick kids bring in. places offered vacation days (ONLY) since were100% commission work pay also getting lot flack showing,people came in. 

My last job gave us PTO easier call without expectation also manager escorted people door sent home looked - sounded sick wouldn’t spread it. sound like bad people me. 

Baaad hombres.  make anything want, fill card bypass public health advantage might effort. sigh.  India Brazil put global TRAVEL list month ago. again, showing little empathy people Employers lots leeway choosing employ apart specific protections. would surprised protections distinguishes emergency use vaccines fully approved ones.

People disability might put higher risk complications vaccine could doubt point ADA, that's got nothing approval status vaccine. company would offer particular person reasonable accommodation, WFH sorts Covid modifications we've months. people might claim religious exceptions, that's vaccines general.  ideal outcome vaccine blocks infection entirely test positive, though greater chance asymptomatic mild cases, especially among elderly, also seen success vaccination. Get educated first buddy. Serum obligations AstraZeneca/Oxford supply half Vaccines produced exported. Indian Goverment gifting **only fractions** they're getting Serum. 

Indian government failure regaining Vaccines, opened Indian market Pfizer, Sputnik much earlier like granted Covaxin emergency license without efficacy data.  americans even stay home work cold. majority americans going wear mask catch cold, simply pipe dream. usual, Americans dirty work accomplishing more. We’re coming rescue again, world. Hang tight couple weeks. No, 40% whole population least one dose. Including 16s. soon start allowing eat medium-rare steaks, i.e. never. smallpox vaccine cowpox applied topically. rub scratch blister spreads creates scarring. feels similar chickenpox. Live updates India reporting government opening vaccination adults 1st May. It’s easy go work cold. that, risk getting even people sick work, coworkers, case, customers! 
Plus food service. make come I'm sick look like I've dead last 3 days, exactly something inspires appetite,  ya know? trying understand hospitalization numbers Texas dropped reopened, without government mask mandate. Stores still require them, forcefully enforced. 

I think might similar Sweden last year. Without government mandating PPE, vulnerable either staying home rushing get vaccines. Everyone else gets go back toward normal life.  vaccines storing haven’t got emergency use authorization yet? Keep voting! wrecked wife full day 2nd shot Pfizer. shaking, fever, chills, exhausted totally fine next day. made feeling little warm day symptoms. crazy impacting people differently! Covid vaccine shots children date currently available vaccines children ages United States Arizona, including seasonal flu vaccine. soon Covid-19 Vaccine available ages, receiving them.  Two global pandemics equivalent, got it. &amp; vaccinated people shouldn’t quarantine anyways. you’re still reading replies, 2nd shot wasn’t bad. 24-YO. heard hits young adults hardest wasn’t case me. It’ll okay fully vaccinated reduces risk COVID-19 “acceptable risk”, much like driving car, drinking alcohol, going swimming acceptable risks. people experience brain fog, might would wait exams, studying/prep concentration exam. Lol know meant it’s kind funny someone asked two things think happen, say “doubt it” hahaha I’m getting second Moderna shot weeks, side effects expect? first shot, got sore bit dizzy. drank water. places appointment. Walgreens example schedules shot every 15 min every day. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

The million dollar question vaccines able keep (identity new variants, develop modified vaccine, produce, distribute) time catch new variants. ceo Pfizer licking chops. 2 down. Doesn’t trust vaccine wasn’t safe enough get actual virus. Great  Getting second shot Friday. Uhhh that’s numbers work? read article?

They’re talking higher ratio young people compared old, they’re talking increase number pediatric cases overall. 

Just fewer old people going hospital doesn’t mean young people be. Yeah, I've already scheduled work weekend second shot.  Funny, nauseated first half day first shot. Second shot almost completely uneventful. went bed night second shot freezing, could chalked feeling chilly rainy night. Meanwhile community college requires wait 17 hours parking space. I'm gonna rip hair see someone else say ""a weeks"". I'll bet life savings month people saying exact thing. might well copy comment repost late May. Yeah they've ordered much manufacturing shipping capacity. 3 million day moving along good clip. I'd surprised managed hit 5 million day,and demand going start limiter soon hit want can't get vaccination various reasons. It’s commonly used phrase Reddit. don’t remember started. Wait, sun actually shines England? mean, immunization records sent university doctor/pharmacist think fake vaccine cards problem. makes assume even true? may be, let’s honest, anti-vaxxer would certainly come stir fear made-up story. entire family fully vaccinated single one us issues all. Maybe unique, doubt it.

Long story short, don’t trust personal stories internet. Source suicides? 

Because literally looking data yesterday suicides 2020 significant amount, it’s drug overdoses up. True that. world view limited things affect lives nothing more. Leaders, Australia states leading federal government wanted covid run Rampant Australia prime minister leader he’s religious moron wants trump, think I’m okay soul staying it’s supposed to! states make possible.

No don't. U.S Central government one pays vaccines. thing states assisting distribution. states ones going get Texas wanted could banned vaccines.

No can't.  Meanwhile we’ve averaging 40 per day Michigan past week 1/6th population.

Get already. Careful, Doctor Warner come tv tell ICU. makes one shift Canadians month gall say aren’t enough Trump actively thwarted science medicine every turn. award zero points. may god mercy soul. I'm less worried that. That's keeping kids normal childhood. Showing got bother me. Well, 32, perfectly healthy. got offered AstraZeneca February, decided wait Pfizer Moderna. personal choice could afford, since live alone work home (mostly). got 1st shot Poland, end March. travel Denmark (where work) got second shot here. 23 days later. encounter many issues. Even went get shot, wait, out. Actually pretty surprised efficiency. me, tried getting ages ago eligible medical reasons.

I’m WFH don’t appear going back soon. coworker really hit hard spooked everyone. Honestly, reading refreshing. nice little bit optimism comments opposed cynicism.

Obviously we're still far away things ""better"" huge leap consider things year ago. I'm hopeful things improve. dare school wants everyone safe! /s Didn’t read month ago despite lots infections India ‘paradoxically’ low deaths? get got 2nd pfizer last Monday mild effects. 

No idea helped hydrated day kept day got shot (got 8:30 am).  I'm talking 4+ liters water throughout day. I'm desert 2+ liters day already normal me. 

I ended soreness arm. really felt tried lift arm side, past shoulder. lasted 2 days. 

Otherwise felt ""off"" next day. Think like went drinking night hangover slow, off, little achy. day after.  next day back normal. definition heard immunity? Yes, know this, think binary thing. think pause explain paused. someone works pharma, I'm accustomed hearing insane conspiracy theories every person would turned upon finding there's lethal side effect there's least another would see conspiracy regulatory agencies take seriously. Hell, still people think vaccine contains microchip Bill Gates.

You can't win folks, better right thing explain yourself, opinion. people, including article’s authors, aren’t good assessing it, either.

Nobody saying vaccinated people won’t eventually return normal! public health plan essentially:

1.	Vaccinate many people willing
2.	Watch case numbers fall manageable levels
3.	Return normal life acceptable level risk

The problem awkward middle ground Step 2 completely skipped; people impatient 3 aren’t waiting 2 happen first.

Once 2 happens, 3 come rapidly - see happening Israel and, soon, UK well. America’s time probably 2-4 weeks away, aren’t yet, we’re seeing one last hurrah COVID surge people skipping “get vaccinated” “wait case numbers fall” steps. It’s irrational continue precautions weeks environment. truth.  I'm pretty certain 1,400 people died yesterday England... same. Could move arm fine even thought sore (soreness diminishing disappeared Day3) sleepy. don’t think enough data yet analyze this. However, many long covid patients hospitalized severe disease, know vaccines prevent almost completely. someone told long wait times happened socialist medicine?! Oxygen factory...they attacked forest? supposed prevent indoor gatherings, we're getting close month May people soon naturally gather oudoors. see curfew necessary either.

We one Quebec tearing people's trust government, really worsening pandemic fatigue.  Ah yeah used present tense sounded like still experiencing it, unfortunate there's evidence something wild sounding! hear *grapefruit* sized injection sites could send way? That's huge! Science (meaning studies) won’t figure what’s safe her, already know what’s safe her. already know vaccine falls category things safe her, studies doing, making sure that’s still correct age group. It’s like count stack pennies desk third time, it’s don’t know number pennies, it’s I’m making triply sure.

I know might seem pedantic, objectively it’s actually large difference. Hey sure conspiracy requires US government, Chinese government, UK government, North Korean government uh pretty much governments, health workers countries uh newspapers report obituaries doctors nurses uh .....

I'm sure together. I’m job, tired AF, thought said vacation. Ok anti-vaxxer. I'm really scared India, honestly surprised took long get point there. got second Moderna vaccine. looking forward side effects. But, I’m sure better covid. Well least Johnson Johnson going without fight got second week ago symptoms. friend got second day LOT# even, bad symptoms 48 hours. knows? Still better getting Covid! would say 8/10 people know felt nothing significant 2nd shot besides arm pain. depends level health genetics. Yeah that’s roughly saying really feels like dragging shit on. Surely faster way get distributed. find interesting 2 mRNA candidates even separated study (and newest studies coming out). Given similarities seems improbable cell responses would different. 

In case lay person interesting AZ seems produce superior cell response yet seems less effective variants mRNA vaccines. makes question importance strong CD8+ response vaccines look extremely effective without it. know specifics. Maybe name countries stricter longer lockdowns. guess list would short, would prove point. People positions power seek positions need remake world image. can’t make jump yell jump frustrates negates power. doesn’t apply governments also religions people need someone follow people need someone give orders.  You’re right don’t know whether exposure COVID cause long term harm children. 

On hand, decades data [the extensive permanent harm prolonged learning loss known harm outweigh unknown harm. Yeah I'm Ontario, 30, expecting first shot September based plans they've laid out. Unless there's kind update I've missed.

Edit: seems says July nice. I’m firmly neutral. political process does; I’m advocating position ask nothing one. I’ve living life following new rules becomes inconvenience, I’ll get shot. 

It’s mandatory I’m ambivalent really don’t leave house much anyways see little risk family moment. Wearing seat belts lot less intrusive impactful mitigation restrictions lessen Covid. fair comparison. Yeah, really sound like preemptive messaging prepare inevitable P1 spread. key metrics improved last month? Texas reopened month ago, hospitalization dropped ever since. Mask usage inside stores high within major cities, fairly low areas. realize trend Texas part national trend. thought would worse states low mask usage. thought challenge studies ethically frowned upon outright forbidden post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Texas wanted could banned vaccines. buddy mine said going wait long possible deniability company tries get come back office. it’s fully FDA authorized later year, I’m guessing schools universities mandate like every vaccine, lessen amount children teenagers don’t get it. know, top entire country completely locked month  get second Moderna tomorrow. 5 days first one, got flu-like symptoms, cleared couple days, 2 weeks later. I'm curious know going worse there's barely reaction (other person household far fewer side effects second round). Immune systems weird. easy get Europe? July 4th lit celebration I'm shooting family. I’m trying figure thing. recently got first Moderna shot felt absolutely terrible. can’t find anything second shot gonna worse, same, perhaps even better. I’ll circle back learn anything. Also, context, COVID previously. think would look fatality rate disease deciding whether ""death sentence"" not. fatality rate COVID-19? 2%? 98/100 survive ""death sentence,"" death sentence.

My uncle died COVID-19. POTS-like symptoms five months COVID. pandemic serious real. that's green light say something death sentence certainly isn't. MI open everyone couple weeks now.

Some counties opened earlier think EUA seen technicality given amount data behind testing massive amount data millions vaccinations US. reason EUA urgency crises situation. enough data support requiring vaccines. 

A contrast would EUA promising drug treat rare,but urgent condition. wouldn’t sufficient data justify requiring treatment data would still low level. 

I think colleges win law suit brought private parties governments. Argentina? FFP2 Masks higher filtration efficiency, makes harder breath through. protect you. science clear that. NHTSA website. approximately 1 fatality every 100 million vehicle miles traveled.

 [Crash Stats: Early Estimate Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities First 9 Months (Jan–Sep) 2020 confused. link study masks work. record, started wearing masks second surgeon general recommend start wearing them. got vaccine soon available me. I'm argue COVID fake.

But believe following science says. study shows masks effective. looking articles say effective, I've presented study looking someone walk science. Please help? we’re viewing Texas genius state clearly respects guidelines any? 

Yeah idk one chief. People upset Texas said they’d remove restrictions hasn’t changed anything. 

Obviously takes time contagion virus means would spreading within days, meaning even now, seeing departure current trends event effect cases. hasn’t.

Like said, think wait another week, won’t seeing changes current, declining trends Wrong person. also think taking vaccines possible force countries. probably trying intercept vaccines transit Europe India too. crazy ones first moderna last week. gastrointestinal issues high fever arm swelled massive red lump. still lump 9 days later it’s red feel touch spot Yes, variant Brazil something like 20% covid cases. best control voice head people get vaccine people vote. Count check.the numbers said done. 

My personal view vote get vaccine till offer work place paid hours. That's Australian airports. Australia mask mandate them. NZ require masks outside public transport, even highest alert levels. fly domestically NZ regularly, need put mask board plane. 

If people wearing incorrectly rarely wear them. made thing conservatives anti-vaxxers/conspiracy theorists 
 something reddit pushing based nothing. Americans vaccinations. ones nervous Covid vax new. ones actually believe crazy microchip thing rare roll outs happened included everyone age 16. Meaning percentages new people vaccinated average ages eligible before, yet percentage 18-29 crowd still lower expected. 

So we're back original point, person replied said could fixed local pharmacies vaccinations, basically said is, ""that's already case, must something else like age group might indifferent groups"".

I'm obtuse, misinterpreting conversation involved in. Fauci doesn’t make decisions that, correct. lot says carries weight public, turn influences actual decision making elected officials. see that, right? spews interview interview words actual influence. pretends know it’s true. congressman senator whoever fuck asked real questions squirmed squealed trying answer. call guy “idiot” doesn’t play team whatever, least he’s asking Fauci real questions sucking balls day like everyone else. underreporting India Mexico shocking Dude vaccine chill. move arm around little shot you’ll good. Worst happened arm soreness, like good workout. Patriot Act also seen temporary law time instituted. getting repealed? It’s impressive given obstacles overcome. I’m impressed vaccinating remote people Himalayas it’s logistical nightmare. people could left behind years. I’m also impressed high level adults complying taking vaccine compared countries.

It’s supposed positive example “can do” attitude. don’t know it’s seen slight larger, wealthier countries’ response. horrible, it? live barely wore first place, screamed to. work around them, totally thankful alive past winter. Unfortunately no, country slow rollout vaccines get time. I'm still waiting get shot. fair im PHX drove hour get mine. big deal honestly considering im 7+ million people. Ill happily drive hour vaccine. Thank you! Jimbo famous intellect. well easier vaccinated survive...but honesty, they've longer time get line. Right bottle neck many populated areas lack vaccine demand, lack qualified individuals administer it. Getting mine tomorrow! 🥳 Well 100 needs become 200, 400, 800, 1600, etc etc. takes lot time. Big outbreaks like ones make headlines usually happen community-wide decisions, single event. Also, Texas still experiencing seasonal advantages may around months. expect pretty much everywhere one big final wave cases bunch anti-vaxxers start going back church/etc, Texas part that. Probably baseball game. parks overly crowded people desperate get pandemic isolation, bet ass wearing masks. middle woods trail mean safe tons people too.

If completely alone isolated, sure whatever, I've seen crowded mountains lately. Officaly yeah, almost one would charge multiple cost? americans cross border get insulin 10$ / 3 months supply canada; canada jack prices american levels americans... 7 day rolling average first shots bit decline recently. Looks like we're reaching inflection point low demand starts slow us down. think past year given something akin PTSD.

I think absolutely right. probability getting hospitalized vaccination three times likely struck thunderbolt given year. possibility concerning you, either. I'm happy acknowledging possibility could mental thing hope move past it.  Clearly boomers gen x failed raise kids would feel sense obligation community. can’t imagine entitled selfish twit would needed kind incentive beyond spreading horrible virus kills people. It’s embarrassing anyone parented one adult children deeply ashamed. Pathetic many continue enable me-first culture making excuses them. wear mask home, full stop. basically good reason mask times public. Plus, pass opportunity obscure face? plenty non-death risks young healthy people:

* Permanent indefinite loss senses smell taste
* Permanent indefinite organ damage
* Permanent indefinite male infertility
* ... That's big worry. Pretty sure customers this. much sub would jump I've stopped wearing mine low-traffic places like running gas station low-traffic downtown shop ask fully vaccinated Moderna material risk basically null.

I'm waiting give CDCs side stop masking large stores mall seems like we're verge finally cutting vaccinated people totally loose judging latest comments Fauci tell wtf can. Dont worry true not. breath well. IT. xant bring back ppl lost. hits different seeing ppl Care 2nd Pfizer shot yesterday. I’ll effects whatsoever. first shot. waited 15 minutes first one, took 20 minutes. second one 5 minutes. It’s ridiculously easy!  Agreed! got bots/trolls. Thankfully everyday interaction ppl yet come across actual crazies want live masks forever! Certain odds chalk fate. Like drive certain odds crash die. high can't live life avoiding activities. die, time :) post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Health Pope mistake, feels good voice trust chaotic event like this. Although little adjustment hear something says ""This cautious take."" makes angry reading bs people write Facebook regarding vaccine. Idiots everywhere here. rough 48 hours totally worth it. can’t vaccinate easily. Try harder understand got downvoted. Patience short supply US, guess. need people vaccinated long. think CDC work toward establishing metrics would indicate return normality, never said exact metrics simple. say it’s complicated, mean it’s complicated understand we’re still averaging like 70k new cases/day it’s tomorrow, April 19, adults nationwide become eligible receive vaccine. means we’re quite woods yet, despite things definitely heading right direction. risk transmission vaccinated person unvaccinated person low, zero, still weeks everyone chance get doses vaccine, cases still plateaued fairly high number.

And think adults understand CDC would hesitant give hard metric novel dynamic situation. last time vaccinated hundreds millions Americans novel coronavirus killed half million people country? Never. ambiguity situation people understand that.

That said, main point I’m convinced messaging CDC actually what’s driving reluctance take vaccine. Vaccine reluctance seriously concentrated certain demographics—mainly conservatives, conservative men particular. don’t think conservatives literally incapable understanding nuances described above. It’s conservative media willfully undermines trust vaccines public health officials. play dumb, pretend like don’t understand nuance, suggest public health officials ill-intentioned. Agreed, unfortunately paid price that, longer room credible science based criticism approach. 60 minutes antidepressant said worked Covid fluvoxamine (similar name different drug). really great data limited understanding think antidepressants generally safe drugs, kept thinking, time approved, pandemic nearly ... mean got Covid today, think anyone would give drug. drowsy fuck 2 days. got 2nd shot week. let see. think issue extremely high stakes decision get wrong kill thousands people. easy say ""vaccines probably reduce transmission lot"" reddit used public policy strong evidence. I'm Michigan, mask mandates need stay vaccines walk-in availability least month two (i.e. long enough people get reach full immunity). would nice stayed long enough surge abate, communities suffering already ignoring mask mandates anyway, ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ “we don’t know” excuse sounds like absolute bullshit point

But why? motive bullshitting here? That, anything else, get criticisms like this.

What would Biden, Fauci, CDC gain secretly plotting keep us masked social-distanced forever? Even purely cynical, selfish, political standpoint, want ones say ""OK, everybody, it! safe go without masks now!"" Oh yeah, that's fine. I'm talking reasons bother getting vaccinated. Hopefully loosely representative rest population... Can't imagine it'll high less risk population definitely promising! stomach bug going around Friday well. It’s brutal 24 hours. slept 12 hours day super next day. Drink lots water, take nice hot shower go bed, you’ll fine :) kind weirdly obtuse. 

Dates varied across country, consistent almost everywhere younger people fewer total appointments available older people. size differential varies, positive everywhere thus pretty obviously explains trends observing vaccination rates. 

It turns design vaccine rollout prioritize individuals greater risk virus disproportionality effects elderly, results younger people getting vaccine later average. I'm quite sue surprising, makes think something read this. Absolutely, wish would pay attention scientists mouthpieces background science medicine.  Hasn’t everyone saying cases show 2-14 days?

Wait another week. Nothing change guarantee it. 

One event enough. state never one county does. hardly enforced really businesses themselves. I'm fine complying I'm inside another month give everyone chance get fully vaccinated. Agreed. Trump terrible fit president. still serious grudge presidency, especially awful pandemic. got vaccine pharmacist told going throw away anyway since appointment canceled. allergy medicine first, made seem like waste might well take since right there. Either arm trashcan. worked pretty good, got skip wait list appointment scheduling stuff hate keeping with. sweet simple, ""you want it?"" Me: ""sure not."" Sounds similar experienced J&amp;J. hours after, felt great went walk.

About 7 hours in, chills hit us hard. Everything ached. Didn’t leave bed following day. days 2-3, nearly back normal. think personally people would really suffered without vaccine. think hits hardest weakest covid, unlike full virus less severe vaccine death. Uh, one large-scale outdoor event state pretty low cases begin ""no excuses"" take make. even two weeks. hundred people caught covid first game, would take couple months multiply actual visible blip. Nobody believes covid good spreading suddenly see thousands cases pop week ball game.

This pretty desperate, man. whole ""permanent"" thing feels VERY, much like caution. course they'll end they're sure safe. Awww! wedding? Congrats! 

I skipped step-son's wedding November. last minute decision husband said comfortable mask usage rehearsal. One us stay safe take care Dad &amp; MIL. made difficult decision skip it. spent 2 weeks separate parts house since someone tested positive 2 days wedding.

People get there. best thing lead example. Enjoy life &amp; especially time newlywed! really think US could end messing up. European governments including UK going keep testing even everyone vaccinated keep track breakthrough cases new variants.

But narrative America somewhat well except governments following vaccines competely end pandemic never think again. 

The average person longer change behaviour, still needs constant monitoring. single low risk person 55 one there’s shots give Canada! god, spacing doses get what, 3 months get 1 people? Yeah, I'm Seattle, high demand city &amp; surrounding suburbs drive 40 miles direction wide open.

The states case counts doubled, 649 7 day average 3/22/2021 1274 7 day average yesterday 4/17/2021 Tbh, think US thinking real hard vaccine diplomacy China winning game Latin America. idea Africa, presume they're same. premature. would rather wait know sure truly over. FDA evaluate Pfizer's request allow Covid-19 vaccine children ages 12-15 'as quickly possible,' acting commissioner says See arrogance.. pffft. knew cover C-19, sure can’t charge unvaccinated people coverage? mutates ""past vaccine"" highly likely mutated enough longer infect human cells. thought released one asthma 3 considered overweight/obese? considered complicating factors COVID. county 16+ open 😎 part half. Exactly, want anything like happen. deserve credit allowing 560,000 Americans die

Didn't say actual scientific observations Pfizer -- opposed anecdotes Facebook -- suggest extremely safe vaccine. anxiety getting better you. feel like conservative pundits/media/politicians playing dumb suggest audience Fauci wants masks for

Plus, Fox News article. cannot trust them. anyone information variants India likely Pfizer/moderna/J&amp;J vaccine fairs it? What's logic here? getting vaccine want go out?

I'm another person age group who's gotten first shot. lol! Call three fucking MONTHS! eastern plains tribes taking enough hammering. Love god man, slow down. Vaccinate everyone even LAST 1/16th breed toddler crazy ass blood quanta bullshit recognize. 

&amp;#x200B;

It took Army mobilization get Yakima tribes vaccinated, US is, name tribe flyovers, might let go extinct. Cover ASSES! got 3.5 million J&amp;J vaxes spare, start pumping arms. people gotta get birth control discontinued months, fuck it! Buy em popcorn bowl full condoms spermicide. :D Yeah, I’m paying $300 round trip flights moment. It’s exactly affordable covid tests costing €80-€120 pop I’ll saving crap ton money summer don’t need anymore Yes. can’t see sit entire country gets virus grip. might even ok pockets outbreaks isolated sparsely populated areas.    make sense permanent legal framework certain public health measures though? doom gloom Covid first pandemic last. 
 
I'm usually quite libertarian comes granting state power cost-benefit mask mandates social distancing seems pretty benign me. really see tyrannical government *abusing* powers hurt economy ability government get things done. Unless actually needed, achieve anything, inconveniences everyone. 
 
It's like example, full lockdowns, nanny state surveillance, welding people homes such. like seatbelt laws. executive order allowing state health department overrule counties expiring, legislature going extend it. Colorado bipartisan states, makes lot compromises angst. Without enforcing means prove vaccination lead everyone going maskless regardless vaccinated not. getting vaccinated often times people reluctantly mask don’t mask all. stop even pretending give shit. Yeah quote part saying ""Walmart stores still wear masks..."" confused me. don’t see R~0.7 number, anyway idea R number US? 

I looking can’t find it.  Ah weird. Opposite PA. Early vaccine hesitancy ruined lives many. Indian states high 11-12% vaccine wastage (expired, dumping). vaccinated people able recover home, freeing space hospitals vulnerable. 

Refusing cooperate testing tracking process, including bribing skip quarantine. Hoarding medicines upselling self medication. Petty politics. Unnecessary bickering. voted orange goblin .. mexican... Yeah... People shit US, handled situation far, faaar better us, president makes Trump look like genius.  already vaccinated oldest. higher risk groups. 

So seeing rise deaths seen past waves. 

We probably lagging guys month vaccine wise.

So ideal faster action could reduced wave.
It's longer tearing old folks home. might Americans like overseas - non-government/military residents country we’re - partake American vaccination goodness?

Flying back US vaccinated akin crossing battlefield get body armor. 
Also, I’d likely let back EU anytime soon.

Likely get buried comments, I’d appreciate even tips Reddit post query.

I don’t want cut line anywhere; want stay alive family. 
I’ve contacted various consulates response along lines “good luck health service Country X”.

I’m mid-50s Europe due young daughter one EU country partner another. (I’m tourism must respect immigration rules apply tourist “visas”; it’ll months resume process attain residency.) mean, definitely exist 20-year-olds hesitant. every generation, large portion people feel “invincible” age don’t want bother get vaccines things like that. 

I like think generation less idiots previous ones, that’s based nothing hopes.  must republican. Like said pfftt. USArrogant. see they're going huge amount people lie vaccinated go maskless, time people still screeching method verifying vaccine status. Kids immunocompromised still can't vaccinated (and despite sub's insistence, kids still get sick, especially UK variant, long term health effects unknown), seems reasonable compromise extend minor inconvenience mask-wearing two options –– getting idiots vaccinated verifying vaccine status –– things people agree to. sure right place. Canada made Astra Zeneca available age group. curious data blood clots people already blood clots family history them. I’m willing get it’s safe, curious data people thought? Look cdc website see many deaths Pfizer Moderna have. sure clots made news Pfizer Moderna deaths don’t make it. Seems odd said end spectrum. I’m antivaxer I’m annoyed fuck people ranting wanting wait get vaccinated personal reasons. I’ve started lying people avoid Long term?
This acute infection one would expect short duration regiments. Even assuming used every vaccine exported vaccinate people, number far insignificant make sort dent what's currently happening attacked AIDS See, original comment thread talking about. “Well, they’re [insult]” solves nothing. Instead that, try actually providing way think could convinced, trying understand point view. Insults solve nothing. Balto would like word. Alaska, despite arctic, full idiots. used good early stages pandemic. cesspool 1 buck tests would great want people get vaccinated tell helps reduce spread covid.

Unfortunately quite people care that, either. Yeah. Georgia much embarrassing :(. Explains easy get appointments proof either way yet. highly likely reduces chances It’s one thing smug condescending Canadians really went overboard it. Like they’d go assault people driving cars American plates.   Many universities, including own, requiring us vaccinated prior fall semester order attend. definitely help Love look minnesota (and northeast states/hawaii). Wish rest country looked like people dying hear news every night.? vaccine denial ppl young ppl...? wonder increased humidity worsening effect transmission.  look hard it, coincidence. agree, point summer vacation put kids pause. still go places, still shop parents, still around people. right keep kids isolated grownups endure *torture* putting piece cloth faces couple months. First, one, J&amp;J, incidents blood clots. Second, women. Third, 6 7 MILLION got clots. got better chance getting hit lightning developing blood clots. go get Moderna Pfizer appointment really worried it.  live NJ Murphy ruled changing mask mandate next months well confirmed they’ll reopenings Memorial Day weekend. 

There’s word anything change July 4th though. seem willing get covid vaccine vaccines though, know someone gotten seriously sick died covid, someone they're close interact get it, might requirement work/travel/etc.

Also, think limited supply makes people jump little quicker get chance. Lastly, think people want life go back normal care much whatever objections were. gun would shoot them.

If someone stabbed random syringe, logical thing think 10 seconds lose conciousness get chopped somewhere, better kill person. No, suburbs Alaska anti vax. Rural areas overwhelmingly Democratic, native, pro vaccine majority country already vaccination fully open everyone 16+ tracking appointment right now.

Especially store attached pharmacy inquire think pause days critically important convey even unexpected complications taken seriously. necessary retain trust system. 

It gives ability say ""Everyone's who's administrating shots informing patients watch extremely rare blood-clot symptoms may require medical attention, doctors across country advised treat it."" well, systems place get supplies rural settlements, likely latter. cdc estimates anchorage 18% hesitant vaccine, majority rest alaska 25% range. would put alaska near top far hesitancy goes Maybe exported vaccine useless dollars. Fools always punished. already said fully vaccinated people get together private residence, even private house parties cook-outs without masks long everyone attending vaccinated.

A ago.

You're WAY behind curve there. state college students still eligible

it stupidly easy come piece paper acts in-state proof address state college student. one rules meant broken position. Complete anecdotal well: brother dad, Covid back December didn’t feel symptom first shot. sore arm. brothers gf hand, lived brother Covid time did, felt like crap 2 days. Even saying vaccine felt worse Covid. feel like really simple message –– stop wearing masks people either grow get vaccine, let people verify vaccine status. vaccines work, vaccinated people wear masks, many selfish idiots going lie vaccine spread disease others cannot vaccinated (like kids immunocompromised). There's solution vaccine passports, people reeeeee too. people get shot, people let anyone verify got shot, compromise everyone still wear mask. kind reasoning use toddlers. Oh, wasn’t directing angst towards all. trying thing wrote Walmart stores, that’s quoted first part comment. Except lol. true. lean towards pro-lockdown, even admit Texas mask mandate month hasn’t changed anything. think Chinese numbers fake? ROFL time goes court full authorization. Honestly, no. ended going mercedes benz shots Covid isn’t flu dumb fuck. makes even crazier best Healthcare world. Look accomplish give shit? perfectly fine take vaccine before. Thank you, I'll try state opened availability younger people last week. I’m sure catch up. India accepting EMA FDA authorizations right let group standing authorization two orgs skip bridging trials India. 

The use part still accurate though. tried. ? granted don’t know Atlanta, plugged zip code many options. Georgetown student, say great.  1.5 years 40 lol.
For first time life wish 40 sooner. Alaska rural I'm guessing people want vaccine.. J&amp;J still tons use. inoculating homeless migrant workers. Driving areas low vaccination offering, ""No appointment, get vax done"" still compelling. 
And sure, people going balk... probably people hoping reason balk. mentioned someone today. guy phucks watch much longer till herd immunity stop vaccinating altogether! entire time read trying figure obscure roundabout Game Thrones joke trying make. 130,000 Norwegians least one injection AstraZeneca vaccine. jab mainly given healthcare workers, meaning 78% women, mostly belonging younger part population. 1 25,000 suffered severe rare thromboembolic condition.

Based data, suspending seems prudent. added it. Life risk. way create bubble risk. Outdoors significantly safer. didn’t mean transmission outdoors. Realize vast majority study likely 65+ underlying condition simply based timing study. CFR change significantly coming months. 

Also, don’t undermine simple fact far far far fewer people becoming ill vaccination. numbers framed incite fear. would difficult become ill even tried. vaccine likely good enough keep control breaks like flu vaccine do. That’s what’s important isn’t it? That's similar reaction J&amp;J one. 9 hours severe headache chills. feverish 14 hours. Slept 19.5 hours. Two days injection right rain. things major amusement parks Orlando regarding mask enforcement? (Disney World, Universal Studios, etc.) family wants vacation fall, September October, way young children wear masks (3 1 years old). don’t want go experience dampened forced wear masks day. 

And like OP said above, isn’t mask debate, I’ve pro-mask pandemic, return normalcy include lifting mask mandates. anyone wants wear mask wear one, speaking mandates.  Trump plans. bragging military distribution lie well plans helping states out. lost election went way sabotage anything could including vaccine rollout understand big deal masks. know reduces spread pretty simple thing do. Get rid everything else, let's keep masks another 6 months. Pure hearsay, told 70 people ICU state 2 vaccine two serious pre existing conditions.

Going die anyways type conditions.  Virtue signal? even know means?

You're one who's argument ""we've done X 100 years must right!""

If really unaware doing. Read this: There’s disturbing amount people subs think masks permanent didn’t catch literal common cold past year (not referring covid cold, literally referring common cold) approved vaccines kids 16 (although Pfizer approval coming soon for, think, 12 15)  Literally could written this, right 24 hours “oh well” Tylenol. That's everyone's going Wisconsin Center. There's constant foot traffic there. Probably 0-17 ""not adult"". 0-17 16-17 point. Az JJ contracts renwewed Europe.

Still someone gonna use vaccine, Poop def. strained... motivations complicated. people following along sick it, people always sick coming socially acceptable oppose tyrannical health measures.

Mitigation over. Vaccines out, immunity rising, we're done letting bedwetters tell us do. Well people know know got Pfizer 40 up! I’m sorry got wrecked. hope felling better now! Yeah, fiancé reaction second Pfizer shot besides sore arm. Everyone different. add response, everyone still get reduce spread helps prevent rise additional strains protects whatever reason cannot get vaccine. makes sense. body thinks seeing massive dose SARS-COV-2, ramps defenses already has.

That's people COVID-19 reaction second dose.

Oddly, I've read many people saying COVID-19 already, dose 1 ""bad"" dose 2 like people's dose 1. guess body already many antibodies fights ""infection"" without needing ramp defenses. lot world unfortunately :( indeed excellent meta study journal. read it? Amen! Fuck Astros! make sense Pfizer moderna 80% 2 weeks partially vaccinated, jnj 66% fully vaccinated. really mind catching colds much. 

Are studies say face masks reduce chance *you* catching cold? see lot people mentioning curious. always thought mask prevent getting people sick Meet middle fuck Astros? Same. got 2nd shot 830 Friday morning, started feel run 6 pm went bed. Woke maybe 3 chills, covered sweat, running fever. took shower, Tylenol drank bunch water, went back bed. Severe headache Saturday I’ve fine since 6-7 pm Saturday (yesterday). Today = nothing. two previous China-born pandemics since 2000, East Asian countries perceptive enough potential danger. Taiwan China’s closest (Cultural) neighbour knew take seriously. 

In West? Complacency got many people killed. point restrictions get eased? Yeah - it’s traditional technology. It’s one done people like. Trump’s super-spreader event outdoors right? course close proximity long time (people hugging/talking long time). Bomb pops bust Canada higher population Michigan, 3.8 times (38 million vs 10 million) making even significant/odd Michigan seeing total numbers new cases deaths day entire country Canada. near exact reaction, timing well. chills intense I've ever experienced. EXCELLENT streamlined website register. 

We're older state maybe that's there's compliance amongst vast amount population. 

For several days opened J&amp;J clinic speedway think enticed lot people suppose convenient quirky thing do! Pfizer side effects (not bragging saying possible). think it’s possible Covid point? I’m hearing, reaction first shot good indicator Covid. is, dude. proud cesspit, full immigrants noveau riche, great art graffiti, kale al pastor. great city! mention constant bombardment even vaccination still need mask distance. 

Frankly, real case made young people getting vaccine right want travel internationally nothing going change domestically vaccinated. get repeated enough, exported doses country side world recorded covid19 death months people dying thousands Channel.

This utterly despicable. UK alright. USA already passed UK shots per 100 people, UK already largely suppressed COVID due first dose first policy. 

Also USA verge surplus. think probably get 60% total population covered eventually. Despite fact 33% total coverage think weekly demand likely drop soon finish first doses start convincing vaccine hesitant people. Damn, second pfizer dose yesterday around 1 pm. stayed til 1 felt fine except arm sore hell. 

When got go bed started feeling chills. like okay go. laid bed chills went away five minutes so. real sore arm ever since. Sleep rough last night put weight arm also still hurts like hell. Tbh wherever US, pretty specific subreddit state regarding covid. would check state’s Reddit drops apt time Well mean death Covid pretty long term health effect. Ayyy fuck Cubbies 😂 low platelet count. think take AZ wait couple weeks? Everyone going chance get vaccinated long time though. excluding 0-15 year olds LOT people. hit date June still spread tons people refusing vaccine kids really ones get screwed anti vaxxers masks come off. Yes, may die, still good infected. Moderna's second shot kicking ass. expected 20something woman autoimmune issues generally strong immune system, sheesh. got shot 145 pm Saturday, felt wiped 2 hours later, aches fever hit like truck around 10 hours post shot. Today fever hovering around 100-100.5 everything hurts still - worth it. can't wait feel peace mind. 

If eligible scheduled shot time it! Side effects suck everyone gets even do, sliver covid could do, whoever could passed to. Florida allowed stay employed ain’t mad it. bet everyone lost job lockdown counties wishes FL. don’t talk that, shouldn’t either. Besides, needs math got fear galore proved wrong multiples times now. referring to? Second dose Thursday!!! friggin hate needles pushed becaus that's do. Moderna second shot effects hit 26 hours later. Got chills went sleep hours. Next day arm sore. Day everything fine. I’m wondering booster becomes necessary it’s going thing worse. got two Sure are.

Florida lockdowns, minimal restrictions, people still pulling back spending.

People aren’t going blow money pandemic.

Note savings rates across country skyrocketed. That’s still 40% adult population
  
[50% adult Oh voted. virus spread anymore eh? true. would happily take many votes possible. I’m gonna go back reading headlines only. lot concerning find people positive whopping 45 days vaccination still well enough make vaccination site die.  That’s still 40% adult population.. still 35% population that’s going difficult get vaccinated .. Brazil reported 50% effectiveness rate. countries reported huge range numbers one apparently going high 84%... given gigantic range I’d say idea effective Sinovac frankly that’s big problem. said show definitive proof spread outdoors. already said low risk outdoors. name call people make stupid counter arguments. Plenty people think risk low affect spread misinformation others. Lives jobs ruined thanks people taking seriously. 

And indoors indeed greater risk. take risk everytime go public place eat drink indoors. However try keep socially distanced. Even Florida. However greater element risk non socially distanced, non mask wearing people large numbers outdoors well socially distanced people eating indoors taking mask brief periods. still think dangerous.

Let guess, buy notion China owns debt?

It doesn’t matter Yes, that's fine. take shot. live Pennsylvania, answer yes. definitely. live, height pandemic, carrying like big party. masks, social distancing, nothing. Starring Dwayne Johnson. Tell Brazil 50% rate reported Sinovac. Ah shit better screw last chance also experience J&amp;J  said Sinovac vaccine results ranging 50% way 84%. aren’t sort numbers acceptable. could be? Throwing unsubstantiated “what about-ism” AstraZeneca doesn’t mitigate slightest.

I can’t find original Chinese language version Director said want provide (because say say reported assume access it) I’d happy translate see. thing find backing say Global Times that’s nothing propaganda mouthpiece CCP.  took Fluoxetine one time. gave hard stomach ache. lie spray Covid-19 antibodies you.

Nobody wears mask restaurants except get go bathroom, think hilarious. lot rules fit together make much sense. moderate capacity half measures designed place long, they're always well thought out. anyone know minors need parent/guardian present get vaccine? (Pa, USA). Single day reporting relevant. seven day average little 67,000 cases day, little 750 deaths day. wish averaging 310 deaths day! I'll three days! Lockdown 2 way strict long. 

Seriously stop, know little you’re talking apparently don’t humility admit shown ignoring reply question use wrong date. Thank elaborating!

Considering top vaccine rollout guys been, would expected easing restrictions happen sooner. Sorry hear deal many restrictions!

I'm Texas, we've complete opposite end spectrum. Plenty people also happy taking seriously enough. Seems like lose-lose situation all. I've made work though done okay, shit situation around. Got second dose two days ago, feeling pretty elated moment! slogan, it’s basically catch phrase his.. Ok, and?

How change fact can't access vaccine sudden openness skipping high risk phase? Imagine making life death decisions based whether want work office not. paperwork people handed sign get vaccinated. ""Have recently diagnosed Covid?"" right there. I'm FL able schedule Pfizer yesterday CVS 5 days advance. schedule weeks ahead too. Feeling great one day later (but sore, RIP Monday workout). Take look online today. Publix Yeah, man, narrative must go on. almost though people PREFER fearmongering narrative. Lol yeah I'm sure Indians bringing virus Canada. Nevermind rampant community spread. 1.	formed 7-9 months instead 7-9 years
2.	literal anecdotes people got almost passed out, continual pain, commission entire day
3.	need 2 shots instead one
4.	anyone shows hesitancy attacked called nutjob, anti vaxx, name it. cult-like shame behaviour. 

there literally nothing wrong hesitancy. natural. Wow great news. Maybe NY follow, we're close behind vaccine front. math:

Nearly 1/3 people get covid long lasting side effects vs 1/1000000 getting serious complication

Your chances getting clot covid significantly higher getting J&amp;J vaccine “If Dr. Fauci, doctors tell us take it, I’ll first line take it. Absolutely,”

Context important. It’s crazy people forget time last year denying existence; calling liberal hoax.  Meanwhile Canada wait 4 months second shot November: lockdown 2, stay-at-home order

December: Tier 4, illegal meet others indoors etc.

January: lockdown 3 March 8th we're still heavily restricted I've pointed literally last 3 posts above.

mmm yes 6 months heavy restrictions government reach long tho!!11 fuck civil liberties needs 'em Yeah, I'm aware several countries Europe also long strict lockdowns. point UK (as well Ireland) among strictest longest world.

Sorry hear things restrictive though, hopefully things get better soon enough!  Semen Demon original one ring it, I’ll give ya 👍 It’s immune response active second dose supposedly reply comment never mention Cell  able finally register today, though earliest could get first shot May 11th Unfortunately dad tested positive yesterday. 6 days since 2nd dose got tested morning. feel like I'm stuck limbo. mean, pneumonia lungs corona really tough cardio winter morons charge decided close gym apartment building cold dry air would irritate lungs. Closing gyms pretty fucking stupid idea winter, especially considering healthy people rarely die disease.  joking probably could.  Yeah, seems like June 21st restrictions lifted.

I quite get argument trying make. agree strict lockdowns, least understand someone pro-lockdown. user seems denial strict things long restrictions going on.  Agree 100%. confusing messaging effectiveness towards different variants vaccine truly means return normal life causing people hesitant. 

The message get proceed normal vulnerable people probably gotten shot. Yes, people lie cater lowest common dominator. 

If vaccines work screwed anyway might well open up. possibly brutally obtuse? Go get second dose vaccine, far greater risk remain unvaccinated. Blood clots occur without vaccines. point however type rare blood clot combination low platelets occurs vaccination vector vaccines vaccination mRNA vaccines. Exactly, calculated risk. I'm also less worried old people around fully done already, obviously worried them. literally post right yours... can’t make shit lockdown 2 November, followed tier restrictions, country Tier 4 basically lockdown everything shut aside schools essential stores.

The lovely poster referring lockdown 3 started January till March (technically still since still illegal meet others indoors, door dining, illegal travel etc..)

So yes lockdown restrictions ages, idk idiot cannot realize it. Usa bought 3x shots need rest world wait production... unfortunately true. city Chicago, people still wear outside. themselves. really annoys beyond belief. US EU citizens require visa prior landing Brazil (US, least, used years ago), still require visa. passport stamped immigration, visa. caught county without stamped passport showing date entry, would fined removed country visa.

The stamped-on-arrival visa still state type visa is, date entry and/or maximum length stay. Many countries offer certain types visas arrival, visas (work visa, etc) still require advance issue.   They’re comparing Canada highest peak America’s lowest valley. least compare apples apples here. simply put it...in body whoooole lot proteins hormones work signals cells turn genes off. vaccine simply another bit genetic material turns something on, temporarily. case, RNA recognized foreign body creates antibodies it. body great job knowing what’s supposed soon BLM protest, suddenly ok protest. Quote article:

So yeah we've lockdown restrictions better part year.. lol difficult comprehend Population density bro. pretending that's thing. Population density drives outbreaks feds decided vaccinate people rural areas first they're dumb. Obv Ontario highest cases per capita people smallest area. government prioritized vaccinating GTA vaccinated rural provinces rate. Reddit bunch stupid far left extremists like blame everything right. test used proof air travel? Haha fair enough guess beyond ELI5. Thanks. Yes Deal. It’s crystal clear people get vaccinated, sooner restrictions lifted. one knows exact number needed right now—anyone giving numbers giving best guess point. You’re saying people don’t trust OHA, asking OHA give number would guess could easily high low fault anyone’s. would matter individual number 70% 80%? 

Are seriously refusing get vaxxed unless vaccine tip scale? That’s like refusing vote unless you’re guaranteed candidate win. honestly sounds like they’re using excuse anti-vax without admitting it. I’m sad they’re willing continue put community risk economically health wise vaccines would get lives businesses back normal quickest. I've heard sides ""fudging numbers"" story. One side says they're over-counting deaths, says they're counting enough.  


But seriously, break ""War Worlds"" type rhetoric encouraging. see everywhere else vaccines really key life returning normal. Bars restaurants closed Europe months reopen rollout far along enough cases declined. far tell really case many parts US masks one widespread measures. even someone partying last year here, vaccination still going make big difference you.

And masks absolute last thing want get rid of, since minimal compared capacity limits total closures industries. far tell, enough restrictions US allow carrot stick approach. Right can’t multitude reasons require basic math thinking skills. 

First, it’s states run open/close restrictions “a percentage” doesn’t make sense you’re talking national context. 

Second, even state level difference uptake cities rural areas absurd. cities wait rural areas take vaccines they’ll never take?

A better route would cut states zones open zones hit specific target, however that’s going enrage MUH LIBERTIES crowd, weren’t going helpful anyway. 

It’s tough one ight wing vax refusal. give pass say “fuck public health” coddle them? CDC's recommendations believe would considered phase 1B frontline essential workers (public transit). exact protocol student vaccines (MMR, tetanus, etc)

Where? Never heard thing before. ex got first shot Moderna today! mid 40's. excited happy her. much right peacefully protest. Israel paid per vaccine. much so, theyve cut pfizer havent paying... Awesome, thanks. like insulin example, example regular cold. I’d like hear example similar sugar/insulin example, unlike insulin example, one cells don’t already know make “stuff”
(insulin). I’m greedy you’ve already really helped, thanks. stigma around wealthy powerful don’t give shit little guy what’s best interest. they’re getting vaccinated, it’s probably see value it. Yea it’s kinda weird hear way, it’s straight point intended audience needs hear. Tuskegee message. Crying Canadian Oh good, homophobic bullshit 80s. similar lockdown Ireland. Apart week Christmas haven’t able leave county since September restricted 5km since December last week. still restricted counties. One vaccines fucking developed US, ffs.

what relevance all. none. canada arguably largest ally united states. suggesting private american company cold shouldering country northern border supply especially comes things like necessary infrastructure store deliver vaccine

yes guess canada third world comparison, functionally prioritized socialized healthcare system. right ability fucking refrigerate, transport, vaccines.

killer insight. saw Walgreens van driving around downtown Cincy take random people go get vaccinated.

Just kidding, wouldn’t surprise me. Really depends, parents, brother got since March since we're essiential workers, bro dad soreness arm, mom shots full muscle ache whole body me, sore arm first, muscle aches second Connecticut lift COVID-19 business restrictions, except masking, May 19  BRINDLEY** APRIL 19, 2021   state plans move forward two stages, Lamont announced, contingent declining coronavirus metrics rising vaccination rates.  May 1, state lift outdoor restrictions, including allowing bars operate outdoors without serving food. Then, May 19, state away remaining restrictions. means bars able open indoors, event venue stadium capacity limits removed social distancing requirements dropped. addition, gathering restrictions private events eliminated.  one exception indoor mask mandate, remain effect. state also said Department Public Health issuing recommendations indoor gatherings large outdoor gatherings.  pandemic, Lamont opted keep bars night clubs closed, due concerns close quarters could trigger significant COVID-19 spread.The state also still gathering restrictions place currently — private residences, gatherings capped 25 people indoors 100 people outdoors; commercial venues, gatherings capped 100 people indoors 200 people outdoors.  announcement comes state pushes forward vaccination effort — half Connecticut residents received least one dose COVID-19 vaccine, according New York Times, placing Connecticut among top three fastest states per capita vaccinations.  so, state’s cases, hospitalizations deaths low quiet summer months, virus seemed temporarily loosen hold Connecticut.  Ulysses Wu, system director infectious diseases Hartford HealthCare, said understands impulse reopen — ways reopen safely.  key safe reopening, Wu said, residents continue masking, social distancing hand washing, even vaccination.""  flu vaccine, quite frankly, sucks. fairly low efficacy even guess right strain prevalent given year virus mutates readily. 
The mRNA vaccines super high efficacy coronavirus mutate nearly quickly. There's lot variants now, none completely evade vaccine immunity. infection rate longer sky-high, we'll see way fewer variants popping up. booster basically restores full efficacy new variants, gets rolled quickly low refusal rates probably hit full suppression lower mutation rate near zero.

So, something in-between closer Polio maybe TDAP, people refuse vaccine closer it'll flu.  Add Israel small tiny population. Pfizer could pump doses without really affecting supply big powers (US EU). Even EU US would make Israel style deal, would lot slower Israel, doses exist cannot produced rate. love see it. Ooh hot girl summer bout liiiit:3 Arriving 2030.  Yes; meant nothing addition already announced. would surprise Pfizer announces increase deliveries Q2 another millions. Looks like continued upward trend dawg.

Yesterday sunday, take numbers grain salt. Dude learn comprehend reading probably mean nothing EU coming months

I disagree, didn\`t anounce recently lot doses originally planned September- Oktober delivered earlier.(50 million end June)

Now simply refill end year. Basicly help lot AZ fuckup. LOL... ultimate one reality, human beings flaws many, yes, Epidemiology great field go into, remember came become one. primarily knowing exquisite detail happened human tragedy tool stopping it, prevent human tragedy. Many Epi's seem forget that... Every Epi forced knock door two give individual death sentence... population health millions people decadal outcomes becomes bit real. Remember, many want schools stay open *so parents go work*. dress 'think children', sadly like keep people toiling support wealthy.  liberal cities 

you mean cities? said countries, true. never said all. get covid booster shot every year living covid years, possibly forever. would culture determine want masks permanent right, not. hand, federal government managed necessary support people hardest hit policies put place mitigate pandemic, matter try slice it, masks extremely disruptive youngest among us.

People's lives line, vaccines available vulnerable. hand, people's livelihoods right children learn line others opportunity protect see fit KN95's choosing seek vaccine. hard truth physically force people get vaccinated country, number needed number willing get it. could 100%, 70%, 50%, even 25% -- that's it. That's end game. Right. that's fear comes in... desperate need ""return normal"" greater understanding vaccine make happen fastest. Probably. Makes sense face coverings desert thing too. Avoid disease, sun, cold winds, sand etc. Seems like smart option. Adding this, Sweden recently allowed single women get sperm donations, driving demand. Well thankfully looks like Michigan peaked. Seems worst behind us there, vaccinations widespread point meaningful increase anywhere else.

Start countdown. Maybe.. hand, think lot people ambivalent vaccine desperate ""return nromal"" getting free shot huge sacrifice make. least, hope so. article say anything opposite true; Brown U. expert suggested likelihood cases arriving outside schools.  fair, people getting infected younger people likely, hospitalized Yes, far apart. surprised hit 270 (70% adults) end June, cautiously realistic expectation bit lower (or later). course I'd happy proven wrong. Damn that's futuristic shit. might stupid, think get crumpled ass vaccination booklet that's covered spaghetti stains 7 nurse giving second shot said wait symptoms taking Tylenol ibuprofen. Haven’t read I’m assuming it’s like flu squirt nose  level vaccinations combined people who’ve already COVID level immunity, shouldn’t damn close herd immunity? provides incentive fiddle numbers. trust ""Governor’s Strike Force Open Texas"" lie political gain?

That's joke. name lives line. easy decision. Yep. That's comes to. possibly obvious: yet know, want make definitive statements something know. convoluted, Machiavellian plot subjugate good, honest people America.

It's ridiculous melodramatic. point they’re disguising racism joke Couple friends debt free first time lives due unemployment buffs stim checks. It’s kind insane worst year best year others. Seems pessimistic. Western Europe fully vaxxed Q4 2021 likely used vaccinate kids. expect boosters 2022 people got AZ/J&amp;J. sides frustrated side ending pandemic, people get vaccinated. 

I've seen estimates say 10-15% population get one reason another, 50% population getting it. 

That means unfortunately, everyone wants pandemic end work get people vaccinated uncomfortable discussions.

I personally repeatedly discussion cause cancer. People hear mRNA think means vaccine altering DNA something like that. drives crazy. I'm pretty paranoid cancer, short, cause cancer something must mutagenic (cause DNA damage alter DNA). vaccine ingredients not.

So now, I'm stuck position someone says ""I'm getting because..."" people want pandemic end must ask ""Why."" 

It's unfortunate, going reach herd immunity current rate, spread misinformation well mutation current variants means real risk vaccines rendered useless anyway. conversation must want pandemic end things get back normal. reality???

can explain Europe country exporting vaccine poor country Wait get symptoms. guess quarantined. United States massive single country lot people. It’s necessary vaccinate majority population reduce overall spread prevent variations popping up. plenty export afterwards  enter phase probably discuss like vaccine passes might partial fix months. Say system good somehow showing businesses actually vaccinated run summer banking system needed fall.

Or maybe run things make vaccines easy walking local drug store like flu probably won’t even reason run system getting sick would you.

After past year, wouldn’t mind first even though I’m halfway vaccinated, feel reality shift towards second option, least states. Vaccines finally got sent main cities state allow big vaccine events along adults state finally able vaccinated. mean vaccination quickly getting flu levels walk drug store, get shot, move life also possibly feeling hopeful others society bump also got shot. 

The hundreds people probably ended thousands past weekend stood line get first vaccine shot reassured people itching get vaccine. Reading subs day watching news would almost make think places wouldn’t packed, thankfully were. see even bigger lines get second shot I’ll cry. Honestly, probably would met even bigger crowd J&amp;J wasn’t halted slated get first ended getting Pfizer. double mutant

The Uk Variant octuple mutant. gotta pump numbers up. rookie numbers. Absolutely get 2nd shot. get it. birds view angle feel like approach may cause people rebellious, annoyed, lie making conversation recommendations ineffective. that’s another discussion another day. Hope learned something haha. didn’t know Cdc recommending conversations You’re right. sub mess. Spare yourself.... mean person’s counterargument literally ‘my freedom!’ Thanks! thinking continued masks mandates anti vaxxer / masker covid deniers can't lie vaccinated stop wearing mask. age? Masks? seen anything like school interested circumstances. Lifting restrictions. Isn’t obvious actually enough doses offer first shot around 290-300M people end June. got first vaccine Wednesday 7th started feeling sick 8th. got tested 10th covid. Apparently cousin house asymptomatic. It’s almost 2 weeks staying home feel fine I’ve people tell don’t/shouldn’t get second vaccine. okay get second vaccine recently? I’m scheduled receive 28th. good, upvoting downvoting many times makes sense. Facts facts, matter arrow people click lol going confused word ""international"" front &amp; center article. Glad cleared right gate. Well, current vaccines can't cause cancer. anything causes DNA damage, requirement causing cancer.

I get personally want keep conversation, friend group 10-15 people refusing get vaccinated think magical ingredient that's going cause birth defects cancer unknown problem later on. There's nothing vaccine mode action would cause problems. like Zantec pill, actually, regard. 

The CDC actually said think risk pregnant women get it, 100% correct enough data. probability impact clotting issue J&amp;J vaccine rare took 6,000,000 people getting determine even happened. looking determine 1/1,000,000 statistically significant factors might come play. 

I get wanting get specific issue, recommendation everyone wants pandemic end keep pushing vaccines, that, unfortunately, uncomfortable conversations determine getting why. 

In case, might well-informed correct getting it, 1% people legitimate reason think (to quote cousin) ""The vaccine virus risks, I'm choosing natural one."" laugh ass every time see phrase “double mutant variant.”

Sounds scary, added context UK variant octuple mutant variant, kinda puts things perspective. hard problem they've found Americans like large walk clinics prefer small pharmacies neighborhood. hard imagine small pharmacy could truly handle ""walk ins"" inefficient defrosting mRNA doses is- would surely waste. area loads big walk clinics people still wasting time hunting appointments particular Walgreens near house. trying go around every week mobile neighborhood clinics served areas even that's struggle.  ""We need go TV tell Swedish men come forward,"" Thurin Kjellberg said.

😂 Thats compliment insult half are..Republicans? it’s decent thing people aren’t vaccinated

A majority eligible Americans gotten first shot, guess it’s longer decent thing Somewhere around 65% level mean everyone wants vaccine either dose get next couple weeks. 2-3 weeks current pace. Sorry I’m upset. It’s frustrating coming side this. CDC rethink recommendation it’s stepping. It’s one thing talk someone thinks vaccine microchip it’s another push people explain medical reasons. aids reason (idk excepted conditions are). It’s beyond allergies it’s personal Ummm, know... work getting position stay home sick... controlling movement vaccines? argument would've made sense Israel's control prevented Palestinians procuring vaccines independently, i.e. Israel controlled movement, actively used control prevent Palestinians getting vaccines, case. Even case, argument would've Israel that, Israel gift Palestinians free vaccines.  


Most aspects Palestinian life WB Gaza controlled PA Hamas respectively, Israel, nothing Israel's control prevents Palestinians places procuring distributing vaccines independently, exactly they've doing. ""Control"" binary condition responsible everything, responsible nothing. Anecdotal experience J&amp;J fantastic. Got week ago. one day mild body aches chills, next day clear bell even went work night. theres big difference, actually often cant enter all. Many people stuck overseas threatened fines imprisonment it. Home quarantine recommended preferable hotel quarantine states chose ignore advice anyway looks like vast majority EU first shot end June.

Not disagreeig you, depends define 'vast majority'. specify bit more, 225 million people vaccinated (at least) 1 dose reached mid-June EU. “As said recently, Fauci reiterated use face masks individuals, even vaccination, stop low – still possible – asymptomatic spread virus: vaccines around 95% efficacy, meaning 5% still become infected.” Stupid typo aside, irresponsible journalism. keep seeing pop like totally unchecked. 95% efficacy *not* mean still 5% chance infected. free fly find flights, many airlines around world massively reduced schedules. downvoted literally stating fact. RIP. people want edgelords well. really big case decline Israel went around 4k 150 occurred lockdown lifted. That’s study study, largest detailed COVID-19 brain autopsy report published date, suggests neurological changes often seen patients may result inflammation triggered virus parts body brain’s blood vessels. Yes freedom die lack medical care go bankrupt still die bad super expensive medical care.
Also freedom shot crazy person military style assault weapons.  fear enough residents

people go unmatched every year, yeah rural FM programs might issue that's it. problem residents dependent hospital opposite, since can't license without residency. think disparity wealth distribution problem. People feeling threatened resources get scarce wealth flows few. Even well educated middle class followers crazy politics fearful losing able hold “middle class” get smaller smaller. god “low income” parts California make 117,000 yr!. companies like nursing homes charge $6-15,000 month per resident pay $8-11 hour. People becoming angrier, suspicious, desperate, less compassionate try survive. registered morning. hope. Vaccination rate poor metric look supply increases vaccination rate. rest civilized world infected spooky socialist ideas like sick leave, simply... sick get £96.35 per week Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) you’re ill work. It’s paid employer 28 paying bills $134.04 week. Same. never get flu never saw news shot. Ignorant thinking perhaps. soon announced 16 older could go, made appointment. Got first vaccine last Wednesday. Better go Rd states like Dakotas Alabama Tennessee. lagging behind states vaccination rates since people don’t want shots. It’s use lose situation helping everyone getting vaccine there. 

I got sweet J&amp;J SD driving back real road trip (to isolated wilderness areas). Put Post Office signing online. gave real one filling paperwork pharmacy. didn’t care. 1&amp;done kind back available next week. Yes. Besides fact Germany lesser deaths,infections comparable countries. lesser impact economy too. see whiners could think Germany worser Brasil . think youre poor communicating issue tbh. me, yiu say ""change exercise level qnd nothing else"" means font chanhe calorie intake, otherwise say ""and nothing else""? healthcare worker administers dose ""Comirnaty"" Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Parc des Expositions Angers part coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination campaign France, April 13, 2021. European Union exercised option acquire additional 100 million doses BioNTech (22UAy.DE) Pfizer (PFE.N) 's COVID-19 vaccine, two companies said Monday. brings total number doses delivered 27 EU members 600 million 2021, companies said statement. happens Political interference. It’s gamble. One days masks going come full force (my money’s summer). get second shot early May still hesitant outings. feeling first one still mask on, I’m sure finally get adjusted simple outings (movies, restaurant, vacations), mask may come off. like virus, I’m sure everyone’s different ready take soon Fauci CDC give word others probably wait 2022 remove.

This always going grey area time me, time getting vaccines place similar pre-March 2020 society barely worried flu. feels like we’re right smack dab middle summer trying best rocket ship us second destination. There’s going many vacations, parties, outings, etc. coming months unlike last time people defiance. Perhaps fall good time discuss masks everyone back line work school won’t crazy summer letting pent energy indoors. control anything. Fauci realize mask mandates gone summer, removed states. Would really make sense still lie propaganda propaganda already failed? UK legal mandates, doubt push back choose wear one. time doubt they'll popular wear outside winter. I’m waiting this... can’t wait! number countries still containing situation well travel restrictions/quarantine lockdown, despite lowish vaccination rate vs US, Chile, Israel, etc. Dave Burke deaths, cases, hospital census COVID19. reporting blip census, cases appear downturning, CFR finally dropping.

Baby Purée fine dandy CDC whomever came new report last year heavy metals baby food (mostly rice sweet potato carrots) talked dr said limit foods etc etc. mind already making baby food found - glad about. reasons delaying vaccination frankly that’s right mean fully vaccinated, that's pretty realistic goal actually. Right, fucking idiot would think would continue year? Surely dear leaders precipice giving lives back us won’t ever abuse power I'd still day general shortage metro area though. seems place easily get shot that's hour drive me

I'm also confused though today definitely asking QR code get sign appointment. Maybe different process appointment. 

Regardless though - yes, ATL area, that's way go I’ve heard stories people hopping Indiana since difficult get one Chicago weren’t making fuss residency since turnout Indiana low. concur, steep upward trajectory cases appears stopped plateauing hopefully becomes drop. lol! SHIT! got 55 MILLION vaccines dumb white people, outside maybe, would risk taking them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fucking take vax pile nobody wants. Let fucking die already. lol! arrogance sense entitlement astounding. Read this. think about. Many people die greed.  Getting kids vaccinated protecting adults kids themselves. Hardly children died coronavirus (less 300 75+ million), preexisting conditions. amount kids died 2020 actually fell compared 2019, despite COVID. Thank science bidens leadership. dodged 2nd trump bullet. people keep healthy lifestyle *consistently* long term. IMO need ""addiction"" lifestyle Yes. need stick around tourist though least 3 weeks second shot. too. really thought we'd top around total 38-45% similar flu vaccine. Pleasantly surprised.  Thank much! also gold. true anymore. Anybody go Mercedea Benz Stadium get vaccinated Phizer vaccine. appointment necessary. walk best way put it.  add struts boosters! ;) half trump voters Don’t people still run problem trying get back Australia funeral dying family? jobs ok missing 3 weeks minimum (1 week travel attend funeral, 2 weeks quarantine) funeral? possibility flight cancellations. going decided drive 2.5 hours Bakersfield. Yeah annoying like 6 week process first dose fully vaccinated wanted soon possible safe. Hopefully next dose find something closer.  kind shit makes begin sympathize people protesting this. Indefinite mask mandates social distancing even people get vaccines? mean whatever want like wear masks after, passed, would 100% pissed off. Businesses suffering year they’re basically saying “we don’t think suffered enough, forever.” 

I understand says may time gets removed, it’s specified according article.

I’ll let know support masks social distancing even it’s still risk, beyond dumb.  compared states, $25,000 grant, different loan, meaningful nothing think end doctors trying treat heparin making worse. know cause, know signs look for, test it, treat anything heparin. develop condition fine long doctors know respond it. Obese people less active well. chicken egg situation. Good question, assumption would received vacccine EUA’d yet FDA. Awesome, thanks help! imagine quite 3 4 week vacations. amazing little empathy people US. would want wear mask protect someone else? agree entirely Listen pandemic, we're done you! open 55 Monday. right now, young people called ""line-cutters"" blamed getting vaccine. great. I'm one yesterday!  longer let burn unchecked better chance mutating evade protection. threat low won’t time. there’s Census data, figure 1.7% 0-17 year olds received least one dose?  Clinical trials also ongoing 6 months plus, 16 also vaccinated. count well? survived 1919 pandemic killed 20 million people. vaccine ever created burned 2 years. Link? Hence disagreement it, wish he'd given another weeks. I'm pointing suggestion well vaccinations wrong. Yes, give vaccines anyone, whether U.S. citizen not. /r/theydidthemath I’m really done special treatment parents getting. aren’t people suffering pandemic, neither children. can't, I'm full-time college student synchronous online classes. weeks semester over, might travel then. world would survive economically vaccines took long. choice take risk. think misunderstanding me. roll Walgreens sign says “walk ins covid vaccine right now”. 

They go it’s easy. Let’s make easy! 

In mean time haven’t lying like young ppl know jump ahead old people lol. Many also remember swine flu debacle. like golden Ass  disease fractional percentage death rate, even 70% effective enough I’m going back normal access Same. issue getting one near me. Cases falling cliff yet there. Thank you. truly mean it. got mine 15 years ago now, see three tiny indentations poker. needle use. Like said, touch smallpox vaccine. No. everyone wants vaccination get one, over. Masks never going normalized vast majority people Lucky them. run trouble supervisor order get appointment. thought United States handling COVID-19 poorly, that's I've heard Reddit last year. mean United States needs vaccines badly? Screen antibodies getting vaccinated. Northeast here: masks mandatory everywhere, everyone wears one time. might see one person without, person would get strange looks. definitely big aspect Governor Sununu's refusal extend mask order political (and disagree it), NH leading country first doses given nearly 60%. know be? Last heard next year seems like long wait group that's almost entirely unaffected. single person thumbnail wearing mask correctly, all. Airports literally place wear there. Lol comment needs love! Downside soaring home prices: soaring real estate taxes.

High prices benefit sellers, home buyers homeowners staying put paying steep price it. lucky 1%. sucked I'd protected Overemphasizing outdoor spread case diminishing returns, especially bottom falls community spread. I'm kinda curious mass vaccination polio measles went back then. everyone get one shot think completely immune? people get yearly boosters transmission went down? know right away many doses would need guess? There's part thinks Covid going go way measles instead flu yet see variant completely evades vaccines. Oddly, remember dad one. enlisted around 1959... Gotta figure walk needle gauntlet MEPS whatever called MEPS 50s. firstly chance still non trivial

Again, cares? long they're getting vaccinated. got mine grocery store. That's crazy right that. think anyone saw coming. pretty well vaccine side things. We've hearing year (along reports pilot programs)

But never seems materialize widespread deployments. India: Hold beer

*Cracks knuckles*

(continued....) One big mistakes whole things elevating Fauci basically 'Health Pope', allowed end hanging latest vague pronouncement always happens far behind times. often contradictory. yeah, see Pope similarity wait long enough end people claiming vaxxed excuse wear mask.  Even says things could happen rare. Spreading fear long term effects sounds lot like antivax propaganda. less Canadians died mean situation dire. could well get close European/US numbers things continue current trajectory. Even so, equivalent 200,000 Canadians died coronavirus adjusted population. longer vaccinating general population takes, numbers continue tick upwards. don’t get mad people hesitant. get mad people aggressively spread unsubstantiated information influence others make poor health decisions. didn’t listen world mask up. Instead u followed direction fumbling idiot.

And holding vaccines materials make them. Tweet serum institute CEO ‘Respected @POTUS, truly unite beating virus, behalf vaccine industry outside U.S., humbly request lift embargo raw material exports U.S. vaccine production ramp up. administration details.’

Top U.S. health officials beginning rethink strategy distributing doses based population’. 

You’ve order 300 million AZ vaccines aren’t using them, emergency act allows manufacturing allow distribution countries. yes .. killing people. stop making gun company rich ffs, puts controls in.  No, given much informed risks consequences compared politicians, probably listen him, yeah? face coverings intended purpose market since perhaps beginning recorded history? Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J &amp; Astra shown work large degree worst variant, South Africa. half Americans received least one shot, quarter Americans fully vaccinated, mean vaccinated quarter Americans 4-5 weeks? (2-3 weeks shots + 2 weeks full vaccination) percentage folks extremely bitter there's end sight this, see number people ""right things"" pandemic going able ""get away"" it. Governor Kentucky got right. x% population vaccinated, restrictions pulled back. Get public pressure get vaccinated. wish got Pfizer, got moderna I've headaches since injection Thursday first dose second. got mine (even tho Europe wanted share anyway lol)! 30 year olds, too. I'm 33 friends split 50/50 getting it. blows mind. We're generations deal Polio anything vaccines extremely appreciated. 

My entire family least one dose (Husband due second May 8th!) Husband's maternal family it. 

The worst part quite health care.

So...pretty much rest world? Unless people anti mask anti vaccine suddenly claiming we're ""endangering"" getting back normal. feels like entire last year half defined catering bullheaded members society mean people happened die getting shot found completely unrelated? halt vaccine? people saw 6 7 million developed blood clots stopped vaccine, found 3k people died let slide? Lol

People die time plethora ways, fact happened get Covid vaccine nothing it. mentality vaccines solution utterly baffles me. like folks skipped chapters history books touched Polio Smallpox. 

It's ""realistic"" gnash ones teeth ignore science favor Lockdown 2: Electric Boogaloo whatever hell folks think finally work opposed one effective vaccines we've ever produced. also looks like hits weights Don’t wait, vaccinate. enough doses children, too. timeline:

1 year ago: Oh, shit, pretty scary. Locking figure what's going on? Yeah, seems reasonable.

9 months ago: Well, ok, things seem fairly calm, restrictions minimal, whatever. I'm fine wearing mask social distancing there's vaccine. kinda sucks, least travel inside Germany, biggie. Numbers low, people fuck up, Germany might weather without seeing many problems.

6 months ago: Hey, uhh, numbers keep going alarming rate. Maybe government something. No? Still no? Oh, going something weeks might helpful. things actually stop growth? Fuuuuuuck.

3 months ago: Well, shitty Christmas New Years. would've better they'd said start lockdown going continue end year. least could've planned around bit better. matters, cases booming anyway.

Now: Fucking hell. Either real lockdown don't, stop pussyfooting around. dangerous meet people, shut offices. tourism dangerous, let people fly fucking Mallorca. urgent remain calm roll vaccine, fuck vaccine acquisition instead paying priority? every decision anything lockdown seem take weeks discussion, end ""eh, let's keep working"" every weeks. There's many times tell lockdown ""just weeks"" realize bullshitting intention lifting lockdown weeks. need remember massive supply chain disruptions occurred last year China shut much economy leading global shortages many goods worldwide.

But then, seems one cares enough COVID shut anything whether India elsewhere see happens. feel like vaccine hesitant people wouldn’t go Russian vaccine.

I disagree extent, American rich westerners wouldn't. However using sputnik already sputnik lite alright. Eastern European countries seem content taking sputnik leaders grew Soviet Union vaccines. courts tie well past pandemic &amp; well FDA approval stages. Throw emergency injunction stop implementation. Better finding incentive dangle students heads maybe $200 tuition get shot.


Hell $200 refunded via check would work well &amp; raise tuition amount cover it. one's penalized ""incentivized"", college kids perpetually broke. think people know small pox vaccine leaves scar. one I'm technically millennial (born overseas). I'm curious guys vernacular well. would touch scar? Maybe missing limb, see, I've never sensitive (physically emotionally) surface scar description seem explain would overly traumatic avoid touching. lumps steel

Western Europe: 2022? 

World: 2023? 

Here's two cents, random Joe keeping close eye Covid related data past year. definition normal heavily factor mask wearing, everything general open (stores, schools, entertainment centers, etc.) large gatherings safe. US UK, can't imagine major health organizations willing give clear ditching masks spring summer 2022. Lol incivility isn’t allowed sucking governments dick commit genocide is? God love site. forgot /s California giving free sick time get recover vaccine I'm thinking astra JnJ would big help. Adding - also digging around looking additional cases syndrome could properly understand risk. Sometimes situations like this, strange events go under-reported due misdiagnosis wanted make sure cases knew tip iceberg. side effects, general AZ lower efficacy mRNA vaccines. way going settle less effective one. want protected, whole point getting vaccinated.

i . redd . / fynuwqhxygp61 . jpg Germany looks back year inconsequent leadership disadvantages every state making rules time strong federal solution would've much better. 

Germany looks back year people go work usual anything free time parks, cinemas, bars gyms closed visiting friends strongly discouraged.

(In seriousness really love brand rivalry bit) Correct I'm wrong, believe midnight adults United States eligible vaccine. B.1.351, manufacturers gotta manufacture.

BC 600 pharmacies AZ doses averaging 8,500 vaccinations per day 190,000 unused doses. opening 40+ pharmacies able vaccinate much higher rate get BC better protected sooner.

That's true. think want keep later use? enough known AZ causes blood clots part demographic higher risk, known, hold. That's good point. Although antibiotics help viral loads, would absolutely helped stop secondary bacterial infections peoples worsened immune systems, helped reduce number people per-existing conditions.

Thanks mentioning that! downvote ""if vaccinated, live life"" crowd too. Continuing wear mask really big deal. everyone vaccinated stops wearing mask, people stop well. One dose typically gives 80-90% immunity think, second one booster. Well, look envelope Israeli infection rate curve, notice steepens start September.

Can guarantee lockdown nothing? No, can't guarantee anything, also know lockdown came start Jewish holidays attempt stop mass congregations, ultra orthodox Arab communities several 1000+ people events (more usual even), little repercussions, two communities highest infection rates. mean, California many adults. may never hit 1M/day that’s ok too. making point. Consider next pandemic covid variant fall. believe 2-3 weeks 50% total population gets vaccinated, adult population. Given we're vaccinating 1% population per day, 50% couple weeks.

My initial **beginning** study

The comment replied studies That’s awesome! Last week marked point considered fully vaccinated. mom also fully vaccinated she’s actually visiting right staying days! hadn’t seen almost year. Almost family fully vaccinated well may I’m going visit can’t wait. incompetent prime minister Modi holding state election rallies amidst this. also gave vaccines countries improve image could’ve vaccinating people. don’t really think vast majority EU adults first shot end June.
Obviously depends definition vast majority, mean 60% population *may* possible.
But UK 60% adult population vaccinated mid-April, don’t see celebrate honestly.. We've found outcome patients CPAP, BIPAP intubation doesnt work. count half fingers one hand number patients helped devices. see better outcome patients put low pressure, high flow oxygen masks, hence 4 sources 10L/min each. flowmeters, go even higher 16L/min (the ones use) doesnt good patient. disingenuous opinion. breakthrough infection data encouraging still preliminary, myopic focus death serious illness doesn’t address concerns people may ending long Covid. one open since vaccination still cautious. won’t things like see people don’t know indoors eat indoor restaurant community spread stops demonstrate isn’t risk long Covid breakthrough infections. also dislike term mutations always relative. Saying 2 ""mutations"" means 2 differences compared first one studied. Every gene every organism ""mutation"". end day matters infectious is. That’s exactly point worry given possible conclusion come little information that’s given. you’re college age kid, coming going, keeping track sh1t, etc. 

/used college kid ground glass something fixed? get argument... I'm saying tying reopening restrictions hospitalizations good thing. saying that's good enough? like nebulous thing left backs highly risk-intolerant unelected public health officials (who great job things they've tasked with) think that's every bit damaging potential issue see relying accurate hospitalization metrics. far chance shot States Australia.
You guys police shooting people crazy people guns shooting people alarming regularity.
That certainly doesn’t happen often Australia. There's nothing could that. signed deals every major vaccine maker early US, UK European nations. vaccine manufacturers made decision send largest shipments nations biggest outbreaks nations gave money vaccine development first. 

NZ Australia put bottom list. Australia put faith AZ made deal manufacture vaccine itself, backfired. NZ simply small wealthy enough compete bigger, wealthier countries. wait Pfizer deliver vaccines paid months. suppose human trials uyghurs tibetans. media reported CDC reported last fall: Trump fan said cases decrease stop testing right. mandatory testing find bunch asymptomatic cases. states person schooling mandating testing kids cases spiking.

I think need realize vaccines large portion vulnerable vaccinated least 1 shot cases mean something different now. great lot cases dire past. ""I know feel, bro."" - Louisville, KY Even compromised people gotten vaccine don’t full protection someone robust immune system like have. may also kids, unable get vaccine, likely catch Covid school, daycare, play groups. it’s important mass vaccinations, truly return normal.

No, tested positive week later. luck. kids ~~could~~ die result. 

FTFY India vaccine. costs $5. It’s supply issue either. It’s handed like candy there. It’s politics issue. realize many areas country never mask mandate hasn’t one months? vaccines available everyone rest county far behind dropping mask mandates. wear mask however long want, that’s prerogative don’t expect many people join you. partnership would give BioNTech bodies, resources, money, locations produce vaccines, thus greatly increasing vaccine production rate able distribute vaccine people.

Gee almost manufacturing testing something BioNTech without pfizer. It’s wild way virus spikes think we'll ever achieve global eradication COVID. able eliminate domestic spread (just like dozen+ diseases still exist globally). 

Animal reservoirs issue, pretty clear major one. fact several countries (e.g. Australia, China, New Zealand, others) achieved complete elimination disease shows regular spread animals humans significant. peeing section public pool, neat.  Good data doesn’t matter people power misuse straight ignore them.

Which happening quite bit certain group people eat hook line sinker. BioNTech could partnered every company able produce vaccines big scale.

But didn't. Get it. would 2 shots logistically challenging? go place Cool 1 3 chance long covid instead That’s efficacy works. That’s works. Something tells going one hell scandal uncovered Michigan Legislature. epidemiologist correct I’m wrong weren’t major diseases eradicated ones didn’t animal reservoir? would make zero Covid harder.

Hopefully mutates becomes cold like (harmless). vaccines point continue save lives, guess point. wear mask go dope activities. stayed locked house would ever wear mask Fauci hinted case yesterday he’s mister “abundance caution”. NZ people relatively loose rules little actual enforcement well. We've never even mask mandate, recommendation highest alert levels. Generally 1/3 1/2 people supermarket would wearing mask strictest lockdowns. 

But rules strict even though people pushed boundaries minority totally ignored them, enough cut R0 0.4 kill virus. 

You set strict rules, take relatively relaxed enforcement regime strong public health campaign playing people's sense responsibility patriotism encourage compliance rather force it. Almost one actually arrested breaking lockdown rules NZ. 

And Kiwis generally rule-following, compliant people like Germans Japanese. I’d say phased reopening last restrictions go July august depending vaccine uptake covid stats. Zero COVID completely realistic enough people get shots. That's literally takes. mean wait zero cases end restrictions (it take least year eliminate endemic spread via herd immunity), zero COVID definitely goal 100% achievable. 

That said, agree OP bit alarmist. wait till ""zero COVID"" start fully enjoying life without restrictions. said, many states COVID cases still high caution used, even vaccinated. example, even vaccine, would definitely avoid indoor dining state still high rates spread (e.g. Michigan great example). 

There better protection low case spread. example, Israel, safer unvaccinated person today vaccinated peak. Cases Israel 98% early January, exceeds estimated protection vaccine (90-95% symptoms, 87%-99% hospitalization). 

In addition personally protective, vaccine tool helps us get low case loads reduces risk. Shhh. agree kind stuff fuels fears big segment population. Wahh!! want new normal. makes feel little better. hope relatives feeling better! Honestly, teacher, think one main reasons spread year correct decision made hybrid program. best compromise kept health education even keel. suspect mistake bring kids back buildings once, especially I've heard multiple kids travelling, guests state etc. Also, denying variants contagious affect children more. evidence kids feeling fatigued teachers kept protocols fatigue. potentially recipe disaster. layout room going resemble sardines tin. yet vaccinated plan take classes outdoors much possible. continue wearing n95 hope best. Let get last month half unscathed. [The central government finally decided financially support SII Bharat Biotech. people.. selfish idiots. Adult population, right? Since there's lot under-16s still can't get it. You’re assuming there’s overlap covid getting vaccine. Thus far, every person know confirmed suspected covid getting vaccine. 

To clear, don’t think every person covid get vaccinated. think overlap larger lot us might think is. vaccines aren’t going return things normal what’s point?

Not OP point save lives. someone “health official” doesn’t give right remake world according whims.

Resist world hypochondriacs decide whether you’re allowed leave home socialize people.

Yeah, able partially reopen quickly, I'd say there's fair chance we'll couple weeks behind end June. that, need actual sick time.

I'm convinced reason still universal mask mandates. got second moderna shot last friday. Hopefully work tomorrow, saturday hell me. even hurt blink sore. Why? expect EMA apart stating cases extremely rare vaccine used anyway. EMA recommend stopping use AZ, definitely J&amp;J either.

Hardly benevolent countries. know much Australia New Zealand rely upon foreign business investment? ""great"" countries going bit butt harder could ever imagine shit hits fan. likely receive weeks come minimum. I'll surprised 13 year old vaccinated school next term. guess I'm going hope 6 year old survives it, even B117 seems dangerous kids, see approving age group anytime year. 70% vaccination rate indication occurring? far evidence far variants far recognized T-cells. Hate one break people would lie vaccinated living normally year now. vaccinated? Depends timing. Love line waiting get 1st shot! Normally 2000 deaths per day UK, that's quite surprise. Remote schooling risks kids. Mental health among kids decline suicides up. Adults might able able cope really tough kids. I'm even talking effects education.

There's easy solution wish would continue providing commentary updates. projection helped maintain hope. Key words, city. consider living normal life dangerous me, respiratory infection severity COVID certainly given lung condition. Seeing still active pandemic happening aforementioned respiratory illness circulating rampantly, case numbers increasing, makes living normal life significantly dangerous now. countless Americans may may aware conditions make higher risk. even conditions, unknown reasons killed virus left permanently harmed it. We're weeks away adults least able vaccinated want completing course. understand rush open achieve close. feels like pulling intersection light turns yellow--wait two seconds light green significantly lower chance t-boned even though theory yellow light means people slowing stop. heading winter cases would go alone, compared lower numbers summer. Hopefully people get second dose wave subside. Doubt it, 15th March  conversation around mandatory vaccination like walking room full TNT. Lmao articles know exactly they're headlines wonder turn 16 first get approved 15 first. least context, blame reporter wrote article vs health experts. possible took quotes greater context kids get sick Dr's wanting people pretend like nothing happening. I'd argue journalist pre-emptive story found quotes make happen. First dose first works. lockdown mostly lifted point, indoor hospitality really last places waiting open.  Arizona wants people wear masks everyone wants vaccine opportunity get one, _he say exactly that_. Instead whenever asked Fauci many others give non-answers. People aren’t dumb frustrated that. live DMV super population dense doubt I’d get walk ins. walk ins know 2 hours away. 

The maryland preregistration aint tell shit schedule yet haha. 

But ya know according reddit available lol UK 95% uptake vulnerable 50+ US 80%. harder US.

It harder US, vaccine skepticism here, UK's first-dose priority plays role getting larger proportion people 1 dose. US well ahead fraction people fully vaccinated. younger people taking scraps older people get first pick.

Older people much likely need hospitalization get COVID. finite amount hospital capacity vaccinating 60s makes sense. I'm irritated. sister brother refuse get vaccine ""they want try something rushed"" smh Serious question - eligible still planning get it, why? God speed. Drink lots water take easy. Moderna #2 knocked out. I've read lot papers know groups like NASCAR &amp; NBA already used dogs help sniff COVID+ people. 
 
What seen discussed whether dogs catch COVID job? anyone know using sniff COVID cases puts high risk catching it? Valid concern. hoping best. know difference lowering quickly lowering slowly? 100 many. Thats Canadian way. Bonus points youre old, rich white. would also avoid people like that. Death rate part problem. Millions become seriously ill, many sick long time. Think others wear mask. Spread schools open community lower primary vectors faculty, students. data backup articles pushed children covid. Covid less 90 days got first dose, first dose immune response second one people. Second dose gonna suck aassssssss. I’ll able go whitewater ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ That’s pretty stupid comparison. People going continually die heart disease decades come, COVID generation (at least) event. US might end reaching herd immunity amount people who’ll die minuscule. Heart disease around long obese people. Good job, looking forward Canada achieve soon. said, main point I’m convinced messaging CDC actually what’s driving reluctance take vaccine. 

There also might better called ""vaccine laziness"". people get vaccine, going spend hours online trying find appointment every day. ""nothing changes"" messaging makes bar much lower effort people going put in. possibly taking account 100% infection rate? literally gave real example relative risk (vaccinated vs. unvaccinated) two different exposure environments. straight reading vaccine efficacy. 

I fearmongering. post fearmongered. incredibly optimistic today going. crisis stage pandemic over. We're solidly permanent return normalcy stage. 

But ignoring facts case loads premature. 5800 77 million bit misleading runs contrary every study done date terms efficacy. Why? breakthrough tracking immature point. CDC 5800 *confirmed* breakthrough cases. still working collect data. 

Most testing sites recently started asking vaccination status, CDC relying voluntary data collection track breakthrough cases. We're going get better 5800 guaranteed undercount, especially today. importantly, death rate UK low now. may much (or all) ahead EU wrapping vaccination campaign, quick start benefited hugely.  Honestly answer probably yes. states opening things non residents soon, already. June 1st, Alaska start offering vaccines tourists. So, want road trip Yukon... Yup, totally agree, said DEPENDS LOCATION (caps lock people back saying “it’s extremely easy get”). me, wasn’t difficult, lucky FEMA site city showed appointment get shot. isn’t case majority Americans stuck overrun appointment system.

I wouldn’t spend hours day looking either, it’s understandable want drive hours vaccine.

I imagine want shot hope get one local area soon, also, go local pharmacy grocery store offers shot, always ask give one, local Publix, they’ve offered shot multiple times refuse I’m already vaccinated obviously. pain demand high way overthinking this.

go epcot enjoy yourself. Colorado similarly way makes sense. not? 

Cases still current trajectory. They’ve remained unchanged current trends. said experts say get whatever vaccine can. lies J&amp;J efficiency numbers actually better dont want people turning J&amp;J that's vaccine offered arrive appointment. numbers don’t add ALL. pulling from, months ago? We’re already past 50%, that’s several major groups unable get vaccine. full paper, available cites many previous studies discusses contradictory findings. vaccine targets specific proteins spikes hidden glycan shielding. spikes evolve shielded develop new vaccines. going bodies experiencing coronaviruses sort memory - cells forgetting combat antigens quick manner.  


Cross reactivity bodies normally fight diseases. Let's assume gigantic number people get shots today.

I think that's reasonable assumption (at least think significantly higher number vaccines previous days). 

Most states high availability low demand already opened state's general population, expect see shift daily vaccinations result this.

State high demand (that previously needed prioritize certain groups general population) already near fully capacity weeks, continue near full capacity. eligibility opened today, earliest date could book second week May.

FWIW, think U.S. incredible job vaccine rollout news huge milestone, actually suggest there'll sudden surge vaccinations. Sure, absolutely individuals statistic outliers, vaccination schemes primary goals reduce load hospitals reduce deaths. goals achieved. 

It 'mission accomplished' vital areas covered. still ~450k day, hopefully step May they'd find someone willing reinfected lol

Probably published advertisement. mean, young healthy person chances complications low finding people willing problem. globally speaking, far over.

Globally speaking even started. Covid deaths far concentrated rich countries.

India Brazil show global poor headed. Next up, sub Saharan Africa. get different situation right? pandemic still control, important able trust information vaccinated. dumb question all! Blood constantly exists state coagulation (clotting) vs. anticoagulation, like tug war. things tip balance one direction other: big one Factor III/Tissue Factor (TF). lines blood vessels exposed blood vessels damaged, like trauma. sets bunch stuff ultimately creates clot prevent us bleeding start repair process!

It's hard say exactly deadly blood clots are, usually find they're clinically significant (when they're big enough cause symptoms). sometimes find incidentally, like ultrasound something else. find them, they're big enough block blood flow causing back-up behind leading things like swollen arm leg. dangerous they're deep vein thrombosis (DVT) become dislodged travel heart lungs, become stuck, forming pulmonary embolus. big chunk lungs getting blood flow providing oxygen body. None talking blood clots arteries, tend rarer, much dangerous. Sorry wall text! No, us rich countries dropped ball trying fight bid vaccines instead standing together governments telling corporations we’re going buy bulk joint multi lateral operation, share resources well methods efficient distribution. it’s truth want fix this, mandatory unlimited sick PTO, universal healthcare, dismantling capitalism

That escalated quickly there, Comrade. 

Once dismantle fundamental foundation market economies, may ask going replace with?

I'm sorry capitalism, itself, problem. Unfettered, unregulated, unconstrained capitalism is. proper controls limit wealthy syphoning wealth themselves, takes people giving shit that. 

The problem capitalism, problem idea many us hold work hard enough might become one 1%.

Too many people taught socialist government policies calling for, dismantling capitalism. seem confused loony tunes. track 5G chip! Bill Gates!

The National Institutes Health fund large, randomized, placebo‑controlled Phase 3 clinical trial test several existing prescription over-the-counter medications people self-administer treat symptoms COVID-19. Part [Accelerating COVID‑19 Therapeutic Interventions Vaccines public–private partnership, ACTIV-6 trial aims provide evidence-based treatment options majority adult patients COVID-19 mild-to-moderate symptoms sick enough hospitalized. NIH provide initial investment $155 million funding trial.

“While we’re good job treating hospitalized patients severe disease, don’t currently approved medication self-administered ease symptoms people suffering mild disease home, reduce chance needing hospitalization,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “ACTIV-6 evaluate whether certain drugs showing promise small trials pass rigor larger trial.”

Several drugs currently treatment hospitalized patients moderate severe COVID-19, including antiviral drug remdesivir, anti-inflammatory baricitinib, corticosteroids. Additionally, U.S. Food Drug Administration authorized emergency use intravenous monoclonal antibodies non-hospitalized patients mild moderate COVID-19 high risk severe disease. However, medications self-administered home reduce COVID-19 symptoms critically needed. problem needs more, they're giving 55+ allowing deny AZ without allowing younger take called scraps legit fever second shot. I'd though can’t imagine fighting schedule appointment. Got give Indiana register online, pick location / vaccine type. gives appointment show up. 22 minutes registration walkout including 15 minute wait getting vaccine. Oh waiting scheduled second dose. USA restrictions based live/citizenship, rather coming / past two weeks. Flight connections count.

The friend Europe went Serbia two weeks, flew USA there. I'm sure places Serbia visit -- went family lived there. younger people going live decades long-term effects get infected. they’re also workforce, even don’t care human factor, they’ll larger impact economy. prepare well go well. first week chaotic sure stabilise. NYC NJ thousands available appointments one taking them. 

Why would lie don’t think compromising safety given Covid19 vastly deadly possible complication (given amount data already they’d stopped it) vaccine. aren’t decoupled, get misinformed people don’t care vaccinated else don’t get herd immunity. could ignore still get high enough vaccine adoption I’d agree can’t. OH GLORIOUS DAY Tomorrow! may true extent, I've seen people life least never let fear get way living start now.

I mentioned upthread, too, I've got friend who's fully vaccinated see fully vaccinated people *outside*. may fearful (and I'd even say likely), whole new concerning level. here. Kept waiting side effects nothing happened. little much free time people have. everything age-based risk factors fact people predefined age brackets allowed receive vaccine.

This painfully obvious example correlation imply causation. Perfectly healthy? 

It means you’ve got shit immune system. I’m 27 I’ve flu like symptoms twice ever, cold-like symptoms five times ever, that’s going way childhood remember asking parents.

It’s probably healthy exposed, you’re actually getting sick it, you’ve got weak-ass immune system hahaha thought that. Thanks great advice! (Though first shot little week now) Genuinely curious, especially since we've distributed millions vaccines Trump said would, benefit would creating entirely new infrastructure federal distribution system compared bolstering partnering current infrastructure?

I'm failing see setting new infrastructure would efficient working current one. would beurocratic mess embolden people think government trying kill them. least virus natural, unlike *chemicals!* Vaccination rates 45+ dropping. lot vaccines wasted people showing up. better open vaccinate many people possible open country. Long don’t expect everyone else whose vaccinated continue restrictions like wearing masks that’s fine take time. Well speak Ontario they're 55 that's we've vaccinated far, believe even risk group all.  They’re delusional, IMO. Medical Doctors good communicating risk, ask women who’s pregnant.  needlessly pessimistic. Israel saw massive reduction cases hit 56% vaccinated.  Honestly, can't see indoor mask mandates staying around much longer practice states remove capacity restrictions. states like Illinois California said fully reopen mask mandate, still can't see masks staying around long. expect states high enough vaccinations reach herd immunity relatively soon, think people rightfully start thinking ridiculous enter crowded bar restaurant wear mask (just take 30 seconds later sitting down). surprised paper states continue mandate while, practice indoor masking probably slowly disappear summer. Disturbing least bit surprising. even news anymore? requiring it, open everything back normal campuses. Conservatives morals, care anything effect them. there's answer. really think main purpose vaccine protect people, yourself? purpose vaccine reduce chances hospitalization person infected covid? Florida, got husband vaccinated days opened 40+ I'm pregnant toddler home. Got called ""line cutter"" literally line cut I'm red area half people even want vaccines. Thank getting even though tough. man says people don’t support find ways harm so. republican way Also Washington Oregon lowest deaths cases per capita since pandemic started. haven’t work end worked places given lot shit calling sick. Don’t get wrong called sick even “Sick tired” fog every work feeling vcrappy didnt want waste vacation day feeling shitty. double edged sword. Lol  (The article says 56% since couple days old) covid before? got first dose goddamn, felt like covid get good sources ""outdated"". puzzle found recent sources proving Moderna produce CD8+ many random sources showing didn't. produce CD8+ response tell people?


""Pfizer BioNTech phase 1/2 data suggesting COVID-19 vaccine triggers stronger CD8 T-cell responses Moderna’s rival candidate. Four-fifths subjects received BNT162b1 vaccine-induced CD8 T-cell responses researchers classed responses strong."" know they’re likely, research severity side effects second shot, specifically Moderna? 

Got first shot recently felt like absolute death. COVID previously and,
as understand it, body likely generated strong immune response first shot already likely recognized spike protein. I’m wondering second shot worse, experience similarly strong response resulting side effects. But, I’ve seen focuses likelihood side effects. homeless person ever changed economic class, gained lost capital, given phone.

Public wifi also myth, become homeless everything you’ve ever owned retroactively pops existence resources skills get respecced mething around

Oh wait

r/homeless like 300 people die yesterday? Seems like deaths plummeted. He's one makes ya feel alright It’s small sample size pretty recent study looked cd4+ cd8+ t-cell responses elicited Pfizer moderna: this, I’ve search recent info vaccine t-cel responses every turn get somebody says “moderna doesn’t elicit cd8+” “Pfizer stronger cd8+ response” seems based early preliminary info probably weren’t even really looking stuff.

So conclusion, totally agree think you’re right. also I’d love see research well. legislation talking ""common sense"". Frankly, use phrase almost always disingenuous. assuming best case scenario covid worst case vaccine. Seems disingenuous eligible get shot Phase 1 haven’t yet that’s you. We’re done slowing vaccinations “right” people get them. Full steam ahead! 1. make lot people immune. every single person, huge percentage vaccines. Pretending otherwise misinformation.

2. US least, hospitals full. Again, misinformation. Fauci been.  Look last year people wearing masks politics love see act high mighty. simply wrong. Feel free act humbly indignant. Yeah. It’s happening 10 days. they’re going approve j&amp;j soon, produced domestically biological E (600 million doses initially, think they’re scaling up). Sputnik v initially imported, they’re hoping produce 70 million doses month June (total production 850 million doses made different Pharma companies). waiting phase three results another Indian vaccine zycov-d (DNA plasmid platform like Inovio vaccine). They’re planning making 250 million doses vaccine. Covovax (Indian version novavax vaccine) delayed September. I’m hoping they’ll able bring that. lot pharma players country right now. I’m expecting vaccine situation stabilise June July (hopefully).

Edit: forgot add they’re ramping production SII (AZ) Bharat biotech (covaxin) roping different Pharma companies public sector companies. Vaccinated people don’t spread covid meaningful level. I’m done mask. NY made legally required. worst, you’re required get 1hr paid sick time every 30 hours worked employer makes $1,000,000 and/or 5 employees. coworker stated would get bored home figured he’d come work sick close office door. Another would wander halls declaring ill felt. don’t think that’s going acceptable anymore. (They sick time.) Biden's government getting things done, love see it. Getting vaccinated *a part* keeping kids safe elegible vaccines. 

A fully vaxxed adult *can still contract spread* coronavirus &amp; believed may increased risk asymptomatic spread. That's important continue mask &amp; distance public essential businesses. ""Concern"" sounds like rational approach. sure, concerned too. way FDA shut J&amp;J tiny issue reassuring tiny issue exists moderna/Pfizer. We've given hundred million doses watched what's happened - longer rushed point. 30,000 people 6 months health people higher rest population. 

The last key point. probably choice vaccination nothing. Unless lot antiscience people change mind, everyone chooses get vaccinated choosing catch covid eventually. hypertension one biggest covid risk factors. got second shot Pfizer yesterday. Man symptoms hitting hard I'm glad able get everybody ran doses. similar. Second shot gave bit tiredness sore arm, though less compared first. Okay lockdown UK you’re referring to? period considering UKs lockdown restrictions consider strict? Restrictions changed time considering singular set rules wrong. Yes strict start restrictions ended 6 weeks ago. Claiming it’s strict long ignores fact strict elements place long time ended 6 weeks ago. better chance getting Corona dealing potential long-term effects* that. Makes sense.  Pfizer could approved EUA early mid-May Pfizer already wrapped 12-15 trial. coincides nicely demand adults drop low meaning surplus vaccines. 

Children 12 much later. September may even optimistic them. get enough 12 year olds vaccinated matter much reach herd immunity (although concentrated pockets unvaccinated 12s schools probably preclude endemic spread eradication). what? imagination Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J develop vaccines without big government involvement? mine, people family want trust big pharma US. heck Canada? I'm 32, living Nova Scotia, teacher less, likely see first shot end May earliest that's vaccine supply gets back track. Turns already federal law this.

""Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) | Make Buy Fake COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card, Endanger Around You, Breaking Law"" Corrected. tough figure determine. Whatever risk is, think limit vaccine. Mate making jab saying health important anyone else's. Merely stating fact wait late September chance vaccine. That's five months away. Commit crime something free, less. 

I'll never understand people, I'd paid $1000 easy vaccine somehow required ethical pay. Curfews seem utterly moronic me—does covid spread night? long enough lol Sounds like you’re anti-vaxer. Unreal!! internet access. still thinking terms current setup.  Mount Sinai less resident took places higher pay, fucked especially since used guaranteed full class. fool would still low ball residents without match’s one offer binding contracts. 

And even coveted programs offer money. see already medical school level top schools starting offer free school tuition get top talent. No.

Stop trying let work continue creep personal lives.

We don’t live work. disagree second article I’ve seen many days claims deaths rising Colorado. Based official state stats, 7-day average deaths 2.7. That’s lowest it’s since September 10th. Ireland island. Ok border it, Vietnam right beside China.

Our population took seriously. flattened curve well comparable East Asian levels. 

The difference Taiwan prepared encouraged make wearing start. Little bit round about, yes has. Grim couple weeks back. collapse. Check Twitter feeds patients begging oxygen, beds, ventilator family members. Can’t even imagine situation common masses. reductionist. even saying keep things closed sophomoric logic think individual. hard time breathing masks moving. know lungs scarred already lost capacity previous virus maybe that's why. start air trapping like crazy activity gets aerobic wearing mask. sit ass fine though sitting wearing mask least. Go CVS midnight. next batch appointments unlock then. get enter zip page 11:59. clock ticks 12:00. keep tapping enter something appears. Click time hit continue. 
Sutter health also appointments popping up. go page, sign up, cycle search start day back forth. Click first one pops up. 
I hate say it’s lot like buying PS5. looked fauci reasonable reliable one outbreak started. think hang onto he’s one deliver real science Biden got office. second dose next week 🥳 like brand name no-name label cream cheese... basically thing =) hiya! got vaccinated Mission yesterday pop-up. recommend looking -- clinic called ""Mission Wellness"". deserve credit allowing 560,000 Americans die due mentality ""slow testing down"", ""it's hoax"", ""it's going go away"". counties right w/ lowest levels vaccinations counties support last administration. help vaccine front. Throwing money vaccine manufacturers would done anyone. talk COVID Nov left Jan. give next Admin access data could saved even lives. Fk Mr. golfer - killed people. Why, old enough remember polio? Nonsense. 

Here one thing breaks pattern. People medical field better reason partake 'control group', people first-line usually better educated aware consequences necessary precaution avoid consequences general population. 

Ergo, general population would variety reasons completely different make-up nurses doctors thus remotely represented. 

And point random sampling that, representation. That's illegal ACA immensely unlikely even worth worrying about. shortage vaccines Israel, shortage people want get vaccinated.

\~85% eligible population received first dose, rest, mostly young people, seem want vaccine. said may help, saying actually does. theres nothing stopping going warmer state like california texas, since states (and fact states general) cannot actually force present id, means likely get vaccinated without issue bodies piling Texas Florida... /s   ought give vaccine 6-8 weeks take effect. 

This basically amount time needed Pfizer/Moderna vaccination fully effective, makes sense. Both, cases deaths grossly under-reported. right shoulder messed months, need make sure give shot there. need least one good shoulder, all. agreed, ridiculous many grown ass adults babies comes something simple wearing mask passengers required wear face-covering airport Air New Zealand operated flights. Passengers welcome wear face-covering continue make masks available. Please check the government website before travel make sure face covering fit purpose.  alaskas plan doesnt start june, check numbers, states alaska vaccinating people per day, assume alaskans dont high demand them. hand, states trouble vaccinating people demand high supply theyre getting

really vaccines u.s. might give away next month two oxford vaccines, probably go canada mexico sure downvoted. 5 weeks day get first phizer shot fully vaccinated. 3 weeks 2 weeks fully vaccinated. Thought made good points. Starting 64 minutes American adults eligible vaccination. Yes, re-read post realized wrong &amp; correct, sorry &amp; deleted post.

Also WTF going there? makes sense! think, ever, stop wearing masks altogether safe? US governments debt matter. government issues currency. deficit money owe don’t doubt Fauci well-informed. doubt using expertise properly inform public.

Fauci rarely gives clear answers. articles him, comments full people trying interpret words like he’s sort oracle. failed adjust messaging phase pandemic widespread vaccines. over-cautious point he’s caused doubt vaccine efficacy. public health institutions behind curve guidance, public making risk assessment. Looks nice No, don’t think will. many us Americans spoiled children. respirator fog glasses all. bonus, can't smell animal shit I'm visiting zoo. awesome. Almost 16+ people wanted get vaccinated done so.

The current rate first doses really low. point I'd honestly interested figuring chemical dogs detecting using information develop non-canine test. also learned hard way, pet insurance super worth monthly cost. use Pets Best it’s great. Ford never got credit reddit, that's point. Besides stiff shoulder day never side effect first Pfizer dose, wishing luck friend! Case point lol Yes hopefully mid may. others pointed x amount Americans shot mean # fully vaccinated. 

was saying vaccinations continuing rise cases. Huh, okay, brother's fiancee sent picture vaccine card got couple weeks ago said Janssen explains lot, worried person wrote thinking dumb Face Arm Speech Test (FAST) 
Follow 3 simple steps help recognize whether someone might stroke:

Facial weakness – person smile? mouth eye drooped?

Arm weakness – person use arms?

Speech problems – person speak clearly understand say?

Test three signs

If answer ‘YES’ signs, call emergency medical help URGENTLY! Testing easy days there's reason ro get tested. least know. dunno Cutter polio vaccine accidentally caused 40000 cases polio. Whoops. *probably* need wear one fully vaccinated. 

However, science conclusive yet. suspect, we'll get definitive answer whether vaccinated people spread virus shortly. Probably not. then, precautionary principle applies. Eligible april Read article? Never!! could hard many cases prove outdoor transmission either know person also interacted inside.

If 10000 persons crowd without physical distance masks going see spread. people keep distance spread reduced compared indoors virus larger volume disperse. Yes. there’s community spread. bubble open two countries - quarantine required. 

In NZ masks compulsory public transport, airports. anywhere else. Pro-ignorance isn’t name... no, it’s really good. biggest thing wedding, also seeing friends live around country, going home visit family, attending sporting events, dining out, hopefully proper vacation things open more. I’m hopeful 2021, wish others shared optimism. That’s I’m feeling now. Tested positive early last May, I’m getting hit worse anyone else knew got vaccine getting 1st dose 36 hours ago.

The shot painless first couple hours beginning question got good enough not. Definitely did. Likewise, gotten flu vaccine like decade signed covid vaccine soon eligible. biggest worry might see lot apathy young adult population regarding vaccination even due vaccine hesitancy thought things returning normal we're high risk anyway. sure best method combat that, im already anecdotally seeing friends, kinda ""why bother point"" sort attitude. Well, unless spend 2 weeks third country. Sudafed day certainly hope correct! Another article read said half 18 year olds gotten first dose. hope next weeks months cases sharply decline. 18-24 demographic contributing rise cases. Fingers crossed 🤞 wear mask pandemic care protecting others. everyone wants vaccinated vaccinated? don’t care health antivaxxer (the antivaxxer clearly doesn’t) going inconvenience people refuse protect themselves. Georgia never mask mandate, businesses require entry. I'm seeing take masks go outside since they've gotten vaccinated.  experience MA. Got link book today opened ability book appointments everyone 16+ last night. got appointment week.

Thought going take months. Wow, that's amazing! say watching dumpster fire US response 2020 expect execute vaccine program well. Sounds exactly like made fun us fearing COVID. Welcome Idaho outside Boise. Take mucinex see goes away. still travel ban Schengen area, no. NY Times says 40%.... can't agree stats? I've seeing lot posts this. read article weeks back went detail. 

Basically Covid rules businesses put Oregon's OSHA temporary rules. State law specifies long temporary rule place. make ""Permanent"" rules else go away still thick pandemic.

It's saying forever ever, want let everything expire wrong time. Unfortunately, makes headlines. Good luck spending 3-4 weeks Alaska :) ""Long term health damage"" also much concern amongst children. Less 1% confirmed COVID cases children ended hospitalization, even less intensive care. CDC keeps data this. COVID never real risk average U18 person. remember CDC approved reopening plan floated last April thinking seemed reasonable logical.

Then just... didn’t that.  Breaking news, doctors say drinking water hydrating drinking soda. Yes. fatigued shot slept off. people probably lying and/or happened relation vaccine otherwise would news kinda like j&amp;j pause. Honest question: Florida? feel like 5k-8k range sometime now. do. them. makes sense focusing citizens begrudge that.

But applies vaccines **using**. Holding AstraZeneca vaccines using even approved would little utilization even approved tomorrow, continuing literally months irresponsible. NASCAR/Miami Heat mentioned using since March. (Unlike article front page) 
 
But yea, agree, hope they're training lots dogs handlers everywhere makes sense.... surprised common groups purposely mass spread misinformation sites like Reddit. People literally paid kind stuff. feel like shit right 36 hours getting Moderna I’m dreading feeling like 4 weeks, I’ll there. want shit end already. got planned? miss past year dying get back to? 

Sounds like you, like me, gave pretty much everything. hope plans make it. not...start finding way make happen! really cathartic! Changes entire perspective!

Hugs Got first Pfizer vaccine Friday @ 8pm
Didn’t sleep well night due anxiety side effects have
Saturday 1pm felt exhausted, took nap, woke headache.
Sunday little tired going store took nap.
Only side effects fatigue, sore arm (feels mostly ok now) headache. 

But found Facebook page people terrible results happen (coincidently not) getting vaccinated, clots, strokes, neurological stuff, I’m awful anxiety something happening vaccine/after second shot Sounds like personal problem COVID deniers.  addition, think time Memorial Day June comes, think that's we'll see biggest drop daily cases. whole world waiting Fauci CDC finally come say can't transmit virus vaccine effective you, happens everyone promoting nonstop younger population go get shots. cant come soon enough Give time. We’re far appointments issue Im still waiting book appointment!! Therapy. Unfortunately covid trauma real something needs / need addressed. People spent last year told would murderers simply going outside. shit lasting effect people mental aftermath going years. aint gonna lie. Im scared get it. Fucking thing giving folks blood clots luck yeah im good now. Ill wait since take precautions.  Rupert Murdoch? Seems like that’s job media days masks far worst thing pandemic me. huge deal me, much restrictions. Oh fairs probably right. must've California. either way hope 18-24 yr old get vaccine cases plummet  Considering still people waiting vaccine appointments it’s personal problem. Pretty sure lot vaccines find way Canada Mexico US mostly covered. Idk read wrote right. trying say I'm going wear mask public indoor places go hangout vaccinated friends indoors houses vaccinated person. Public places I'll wear mask cause public I'm friends (not public) fully vaccinated I'm going maskless back normal life. 

Does make sense? tried. enter zip points places might it, granted it’s alway 100% accurate reschedule couple times great help. vaccinate want protected. im vaccinated mask goes off. didnt spend last 10 years hard work appearance self improvement spend rest life face covered ""protect"" people vaccinated anyway. Unless theres shortage something live, masks go target vaccinatiom reached.   yea im 99% sure either misread read reporting bad info. country, 18-29 demo 13.6%, would mean weird shit 18 year olds 18 year olds 50%. think may read article said 50% californians 18 gotten least 1 shot, would accurate. almost definitely 50% 18 year olds pandemic.

Maybe Japan Thailand, now. one wore mask, 99% are.

You don’t know you’re talking about. Don’t generalize across Asia. Metrics ain’t exactly perfect either. know need half country vaccinated, much more? 60% cut it? 65%? hard truth won’t exactly know we’re decently close practice. meantime, we’re still spot know reasonably better still. I'm probably throwing mine out, I'll probably pack away next time. today I'm one 🙂 location specific. I’m Portland difficult get appointments. Everything booked solid Got first Pfizer almost exactly did! minor arm soreness around injection, unexpected me. Hopefully second goes well weeks! Yes it’s impressive outvaccinated rest world headline asks. getting vaccines go. able entire population fit mid sized city. Additional explanations beyond unnecessary. Anecdotal: like everyone else said, seems first shot tougher second already COVID. managed avoid getting whole time. first shot painless arm soreness next day. second one, move 48 hours. Hang Gosh, hope so. Canadian wishes best. think likely get flu shot going forward?  Goodrx.com great resource finding pharmacies. It’s bit pain get various pharmacy sites make register showing appointment times, don’t enough prescreening overall took less time find appt spend Reddit day. (I ended CVS)  time I've gotten flu vaccine offered workplace go way get it. I'll get right care enough go extra mile it. Covid vax though right top even covid. 

 


In experience seen people 18-30 age group lazy it, everybody know either gotten wants to. Since recent age group eligible expect number rise coming months (and can't even say certain eligible states yet - lack research). Anybody ""why bother"" attitude know probably easily convinced reassuring completely free show (Not immunologist take word grain salt) I’ve seeing people prior COVID infections seem worse time shots first time around. tested positive almost year ago, I’m hoping second dose won’t bad since immune response already activated. I’m 16 got Phizer vaccine today! don’t studies link to, homie. Maybe try CDC websites went half adult population half total population? Also, US large regions better others.

The best states around 35-40% total population, bunch southern states closer 25-30% total population. stop another country like Mexico 14 days first Thank you. good tip. would rather allow vaccinated people hangout vaccinated people without masks. Inside Walmart stores there's others around know vaccinated

To it’s simple courtesy. frontline workers busted asses past year got stay home shop us week (you called us heroes two weeks right back abusing us things slightly inconvenient you), least wear mask get chance get vaccinated, personally know you’re set. ain’t long man, c’mon. one time back say claim we’re together. feel like they’re gonna say vaccinated people spread virus 3-6 months people don’t let guard prematurely they’ll flip flop around start Q4 vaccine available general population 6-7 months. 

Fauci never say directly think doesn’t trust us good news. I’m saying dig him, think he’s genuinely worried change rhetoric let vaccinated people let guards more, lot unvaccinated people lie getting shot, go spread virus. feel like malpractice insurance really tax deductible.... Alaska selling vaccines highest bidder healthy 64 year olds Oregon *still* waiting eligible Biden really needs announce policy state month’s worth (or 78 days’ worth!) unused supply doses get reallocated states least state doesn’t get another shipment another week. 

What good could doses already many available? makes frustrated it’s apparently allowed take demand account deciding vaccine doses go local state level. anecdotal stories side effects crazy varied. got first Moderna last week, shot painless thought didn’t actually inject me, next day nothing tiniest bit soreness arm little tired. Feel better! vaccine necessarily protect yoi getting infected, especially vaccines like AZ J&amp;J. get milder symptoms, yes, may still infected symptomatic. Considering loss taste smell associated even mild mild COVID cases, vaccine might silver bullet. Yep you’re US centric. awful reporting, never even gave reason (or even asked?)  merika bad without even trying reporting.
 
is like canadian foxnews something?  horrible ""journalism"" offers nothing information tries stir hate resentment.

doesn't help anyone.  wonderful news! got 2nd Moderna shot yesterday I'm moon!

I'm going visit mother first time since 2019 May can't freaking wait. pumped! Disney relax photo guidelines, already.

One best friends works Universal least 12 times yesterday called numerous nasty names. know they're kicking people strongly Disney, know Team Members trying enforce it. got plus vomiting first dose. looking forward second got second Pfizer last Wednesday. tired first dose arm hurt lot. stiffness went side neck next morning, built went away day. second dose, slightly sore nothing else! Thanks confirmation. Never heard anyone paying Covid vaccine. saved lot 2020, year move 1 br 3 br really hard working home without dedicated office spaces. wiped savings getting commuting (and some). wasting time further. believe whatever want. point study would say competent?

I’m sure I’m getting downvoted either. I’m genuinely seeking get informed here.. We’re back health care workers health levels ages. anything worse general public due exposure. Feel free provide actual reason representative.

from yesterday. Feel free. Gosh, hope so. - Person lives side country still like Americans suffering dying. Well, know would shot everything time.

Sadly he's passed on, can't ask. 😕 Fuck keep coming, I’m almost there! indians arent fat like West  Hmm trump left office 420k deaths guess last 140K deaths Biden’s watch. Jesus Christ. OK whatever said.  know people called walking gauntlet, assembly line vaccination went back far. walked gauntlet 50 years later. Come think it, boot-camp 1950s kind feel it. case positivity rate .8% based chart LA Public Health Yea. worthless leaders I’ve ever seen entire life. Fucking Bonnie Henry British Columbia absolute joke  sample health care workers control group health care workers. stop picking texas  2am, explain analogy? I'm dumb understand. smug headlines news beyond obnoxious. think right play nice though. No. said wish treat real-life examples hospitals REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLING people CONTROL GROUP similar CONTROL GROUP GENERAL POPULATION. already got answer weeks ago! Vaccinated people [90% protected even asymptomatic aren’t infected, can’t spread it. can't fucking believe turned overly optimistic thinking we'd fine winter. Fuck Doug Ford. strongest reactions vaccine likely happen young people women. Old people men likely die covid strong reaction vaccine shows strong immune system could fought infection. UK thing seems wiser choice. Get everyone covered vaccines second doses. UK US cumulatively distributed similar doses UK isn’t getting spike like what’s happening Michigan, Colorado, Minnesota Florida.

Pfizer isn’t even saying delaying second doses don’t work. haven’t tested it’s legal issue endorse doesn’t work out. UK took calculated risk seems working we’re following based we’re seeing I'm sure I'd go far. going take time assess damage young people, especially kids. pulmonary neurologic damage concerning although unlikely growing kids lasting damage, really cautious, especially stronger variants lurking. course matters. thesis health care workers wouldn’t want control group. doesn’t matter wasn’t choice. good! would rather allow vaccinated people hangout vaccinated people without masks. Inside Walmart stores there's others around know vaccinated think fine wear mask want hang vaccinated friends house... mean I'll still Biden Fauci tell us open people getting vaccinated back normal life. think people care much wearing mask Walmart hang friends person maskless.  ad hominem attacks

I referred username... that's popular thing reddit. okay, glad heroes like swoop mid-shit tell what's what. at-risk people vaccinated, I’d argue spread doesn’t matter, hospitalizations do. child getting Covid magnitudes better 80 year old getting it. also aren’t using profits give away free insulin Americans shortage insulin. Haha. Upvote slappywag ;) Stay safe mate! That's said gonna do, slappywag   probably represent 1% population 60% internet commenters **not** sealing plastic bag around head every time leave house, stay **fuck** away me, monster. admit want people die? matter want want, irrelevant talking whether analysis representative. isn't. Period. Got mine yesterday 1pm. Arm felt really sore bedtime, way elbow even neck. Today morning arm still real sore. though it’s light soreness. soreness feel like soreness get lifting weights ain’t really bad. wasn’t choice. vaccinated day. felt second Moderna shot. fiancé even slightly burshed much pain. get comfortable. like almost 2 days, running fever, shivering, sweating. going say felt like burning. I'd still go again, lower chances actually getting covid. I'm high risk complications. Actually 3 5 days symptoms fairly common little concern. last 7 days longer without improvement becomes worrying dont think common like all. Okay think misunderstood sentiment original comment. agree said above! yeah question acceptable level cases normalcy cause agree we’ll probably never zero covid. fauci pressed last week threw estimate somewhere around 10,000 new cases day would acceptable said soft number That’s heavily misconstrued “study”, it’s like one dipshit scientist’s thoughts face masks don’t work. splits total bullshit like “medical non-medical masks work prevent human-to-human transmission SARS-CoV-2” verifiably false. **Apr. 19, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

My advice bend truth bit. lying, eligible (as understand it) actually get vaccine. massaging dopey machine bit. ask anything answers actually show appointment.  


In locale, think drugstore websites still stuck Phase 1A, we're open adults. make appointment eligibility pool -- select one options. website behind state, show appointment specify group in, date.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  became eligible got 1st shot past week pretty much every appointment option saw said vaccine getting ahead time. don’t think common beginning though. parents got January weren’t told ahead time. Aside comment said (effectiveness based results trial, trials done completely different environments), effectiveness preventing serious sickness death - 100%. It’s still relatively new technology still ultimately delivers mRNA build spike protein. It’s exactly approach Moderna Pfizer delivery packages viral vector vs mRNA fatty lipid. it’s easier store handle. one previous viral vector vaccine approved also J&amp;J Ebola. 

Your old school vaccine uses viral fragments. 

A lot people seem impression I’m sure it’s coming from. vaccine rush job capitalize virus.. apparent many ""hiccups"" had, like vaccines got cross-contaminated.

Um, what? anything, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine *least* rushed since it’s based Ebola vaccine approved pandemic even started. It’s mRNA vaccines first kind. we’re honest, every pharmaceutical company done shady stuff. make money sick people.

Also, cross contamination result incompetent vendor contracted manufacture doses. UK testing nearly million people day genome sequencing 10% those, NZ testing ~900 people day... UK genome sequencing 100x amount NZ testing take genius work 100x workload going take time 

As point reference UK currently testing 1/5 population NZ every day (the population NZ half size population London) could see slightly higher number young people vaccinated schools mandate it. possible younger ages, high school seems plausible near-ish future, depending state. That’s true cases deaths, don’t think hospitalizations backlog issue. don’t add missing hospitalizations previous days, it’s snapshot many beds used day. Even lag, long lag fairly consistent (one two days) you’ll still know trend is. Honestly feel like conservative pundits/media/politicians playing dumb suggest audience Fauci wants masks forever. Anyone struggles wrap heads around fairly simple notion “wear masks everyone chance get vaccinated cases come down” either playing dumb bad faith legitimately cognitively impaired. It’s really complicated. state opened 16+ couple weeks ago nothing updated woke morning. least midday time places like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart Rite Aid started update. maybe they're couple weeks ago something right away. figure ""only""?  130million people started vaccinations 4 month mark there's still ton demand many places opening week ago everyone. see daily doses plummet know met demand, then, safe assume everyone eligible wants gotten it. mean time, we're averaging 3.2 mil day increasing, yes, there's still ton demand. I'd rather Canada imprisoned Australia guess. Same. Wasn’t even eligible book appointment days ago Yeah. I’m hoping quick cheap at-home tests everyone use keep tab cases also go long way towards driving cases down. Pandemic II/Plague Inc. really quite accurate simulation all. Yes they’re forceful vaccine. Forceful might right word can’t think anything better. USA, there’s slim chance it’s unlikely vaccinations continue rate. especially it’s 16 year olds. haven’t approved AZ yet far I’ve heard main problem Canada since it’s restricted seniors lot seniors prefer Moderna Pfizer. may see J&amp;J thats sorted it’s tiny fraction supply compared modern Pfizer don’t see much impact overall. I'm 27 state became eligible 3 days ago. Got first dose today. Relax Bill Gates already tracking boring single life! Translate work fine article. summary: 'experiment' real science; excuse people festival 1.5 year restrictions.

There's clear research plan, sample size unjustifiably big said: allegations organisers (AKA people selling tickets making money drink sales) shady links 'researchers'.

Not that, entire thing super spread event waiting happen. Currently anywhere around 160,000 people still infectious (total population = 17 million); time roughly 1% population potential spreader. Right R value hovering around 1.

The event accessible get antigen test, think read points below, become apparent 'experiment' bound result increased cases: 

A. People tickets extremely lucky (10k tickets, 1 million applicants), might even go symptoms fake test false negative somehow get in.

B. People attend kinds festivals tend also represented group covid cases: Young people. high number cases, people contagious ones going event.

C. tests used perfect, 10,000 attendees going multiple false negatives.

D. covid restrictions apply in.

And finally: E. People going travelling mainly via public transport. probably know someone died Covid point unfortunately. announce whether vaccine anything it?  Meanwhile Canada...

/cries least went know one got there, might change they've opened more. (Virginia) didn’t it’s going crush bunch people get vaccine first place. Stopping vaccinations JNJ dumbest public health move could made. newsom hopes reopen state june 15th considered conservative estimate would likely get point sooner. napkin math, able get least 1 dose 75% adult population next month, yea newsom, like biden, probably underpromised overdeliver 67% puts around AZ Yup, buddy lives outside states wants temporarily come back. lot harder 3 weeks get second shot. gain this? people w/ medical issues. 16. 

My 5G connection better ever. It’s weird never see broken like that. assume means 1.7% US population 17 younger received least one dose, people 16 lumped group literally can’t get vaccine right now? useful information? give us 16-17, lump 18-29 group. It’s like age groups uniform anyway. Genuinely curious, hunch seen data suggest this? 67% effective quite similar J&amp;J AZ without VIPIT   Damned does, damned kinda thing. would take JnJ vaccine. Since paused scrutiny, verified safe public. craziest part whole thing me, quickly vaccines developed. year ago, projections 2 years minimum 10 years. california blows texas pretty much every large state water far numbers go, even adjust population. california vaccinating average 1.21% population every day, new york 1.08%, ohio pennsylvania tied 1.07%, florida 0.99%, illinois 0.93%, texas 0.78% yet course I’m one suck anti vax best friend want keep testing well, idea prevalence. flu shot every year. got moderna shots work. think we're going get complete normality Covid exist year. seems governments everywhere outside US planning for. social distancing masks probably go well, seems testing still going widespread. Take Irish government report. UK Gibraltar also similar (perhaps unrealistically high) expectations public respect vaccination, prospects acceptance adherence another lockdown widespread vaccination low. Spring Summer months 2021, outside activities better ventilation, help must prepare now, especially next Winter increased indoor gatherings poorly ventilated spaces. Moreover, likely people become vaccinated, adherence public health measures, e.g. mask wearing, social distancing, regular hand washing etc. decrease work positive effects vaccination campaign. Rapid testing together vaccination, deployed, along public health measures, way decreasing risk transmitting COVID-19 well maintaining effectiveness current vaccination minimising spread new variants. people (assuming recover) could end crippling medical debt rest lives? first moderna felt second dose felt pretty terrible 24hrs 28hrs after. I’d heartbeat Tomorrow day floodgates state open adults (and remaining ones, yet see mention all-adults day later 4/19). feeling going see lot green flairs next week. 😁 Weird everyone different. hardly get sore arm flu shot every year sometimes think, ""I get sick, really working?"" actual flu 10 years I've getting it, Moderna kicked ass year lol. Totally worth though. better man. good one family stopped vaccinated. alone! neg·li·gi·ble

adjective

so small unimportant worth considering; insignificant. long ago? Risk low hopefully fine. boils whether narrow effected group specifying whether individuals suffered common demographics. start 7 million, women, cut basically half 3.5 million. within specific age range, lower further. birth control, lower further. Eventually run common demographics, look denominator determine whether percentage people happened insignificant not. 1 million nothing, say 1 10,000, that's concern since vaccines there's reason extra thousand people get bloodclots avoid it. Hence figure who, anyone, avoid J&amp;J letting anyone else take again.

Some people virtually 0 risk getting COVID right even vaccine take chance? come Friday cleared better idea do, think good pause. Covid reduced level threat flu due herd immunity via vaccination, won’t need masks anymore.

Why think that?

Seems think handled influenza perfectly past continue everything way that. Listen scientists ONCE. one made us get 50%. Thank Yes Thanks. 

Glad hear Covid vaccine reaction mild. masking low flu transmission year probably protected other. yeah read ago. i've taking embracing education, anti-societal opinions anti-science gets you.

Boston required to, seems almost everybody does. dont know trying blame media real significant phenomenon. december january, majority americans either ""waiting seeing"" straight willing get vaccinated. wasnt february saw trend flip majority either received wanting receive asap. kff vaccine monitor polls earlier 2020 show similar trend. factually speaking, majority americans skeptical recently anyone know eligibility officially changes sites like CVS Walgreens? state border opens tomorrow state website update 6 AM, sites affiliated state clinics open earlier??

Suresh Jadhav, SII’s executive director, says “we absolutely concerned,” next four six weeks production two vaccines affected: AstraZeneca’s, SII makes 100m doses month, Novavax’s, expects make 60m-70m doses month. SII says first alerted American government impending problem two months shortly Biden administration announced, February 5th, plans use Defence Production Act (DPA)—legislation grants president broad industrial-mobilisation powers—to bolster vaccine-making. legislation helped American pharmaceutical companies secure raw materials equipment needed make vaccines. American firms supply products essential vaccine production say DPA hinders ability export them. must seek permission exporting goods, requires time paperwork, America’s government decides need goods, firms may barred exporting all. also concerned pharma companies outside America stockpiling goods concerns delays caused American export controls.

Shortfalls India hinder vaccination programme, ramping amidst alarming second wave infections—the country recording 1,000 deaths per day covid-19. since India banned export finished vaccines serves domestic needs, Mr Jadhav says SII cannot fulfill commitments Covax, global vaccine-sharing programme, cannot deliver supplies Europe time many American states surplus vaccines, many one three doses going unused, American export restrictions galling. may soon derail plan vaccinate world.

True JNJ logical certain parts population - students going back college fall, young people general transient (2 shots would logistically challenging), etc. think JNJ always targeted Ex-US vaccine, iirc. Well places it’s weeks even months! Thank much. nice see least one person sharing truth happened appreciate detail provided.

God look liars reddit saying I'm one spreading misinformation makes sad world. That's top disappointment government essentially killed seniors yes front line workers. Pfizer pfelicitations, Phteven. man. day 2 start integrating bluetooth! /s ok. Stay island forever. safe there. Covid reduced level threat flu due herd immunity via vaccination, won’t need masks anymore. want wear one, feel free. Don’t expect everyone else though. might get take home 80k that

how so? every American wants vaccinated pop local pharmacy McDonald’s whatever, sure, export leftovers. Amogus, sorry. numbers may make seem like this, no. I&amp;j tested later mutations made numbers look worse. can't directly compare them. never said doesn’t spread doors. used spring break example fact based evidence prove that. 

See last summers protests. Repeated shown spreader events cause case increases. Many people masks shouting top that. Walmart get mask? feel like Walmart might get mask longer Target 😂. near future prepared meet certain people who's personality restricting life wearing masks even population vaccinated completely safe go mask-less. friend denying go outdoor gathering 3+ people. Despite Everyone completely vaccinated CDC states safe. like there's ""extremists"" hate masks give shit safety lived life like covid, extremists twilight end pandemic act pretty extreme restricting life. latter group harming anyone good. Decades education outreach physical fitness diet.

We manner govt programs decades designed encourage people take care themselves, heeded.

So get things done school, PE health classes, think fun? 

You don’t need sports exercise, nothing stopping community starting rec soccer basketball leagues.

If see someone working out, proves aren’t lazy. cross fit overweight people join time welcomed lifelong athletes skinny minis. 

But friends refuse work might seen lazy? That’s really backwards thinking. Guess what? one judge getting workout home, one.

I mean guess turn camera peloton, don’t I’m sweaty hell ride thing.

The real solution stop making excuses put time now, get time later. That’s it. time “have thought working out” past.

Push-ups sit ups squats sets 10 day long. working big muscles three groups.

Cant 10 pushups, plank. Cant plank, modified push-ups, learned stuff middle school gym class. got first dose (Pfizer) walking thru grocery store yesterday! “Other” trial participants candidate vaccines? lie screener, something stop people registering appointments aren’t eligible for. eligible appointment date fine.

I put real birth date, real age, everything registration, including screener page. click “40 over+” appointment morning went 16 over. Worked wife issues 2 separate CVS locations. think found way fund Covax vaccine doses. Definitely confirm. bad case covid several months prior, doses Moderna absolutely wrecked me—especially first one. Hoping ends soon

It will. almost done terms timing, believe. Honestly, unless I’m wearing long time, KN95 comfortable effective. 

The issue ears hurt long time, like 5 hours, wearing KN95. Really? know that. Sucks, guess lot options. Israel's cases crested Jan 18, got 30% vaccinated, since Israel specifically excluded people previously confirmed positive initial vaccination, additional 10% immunity top that. Canada might less month away. Israel's cases fall smoothly, plateaued twice, clear true infliction point is. probably depends many things vaccination one variable, albeit critical one. Way child name call. simply making counter argument resorted childish insults. ton evidence spread well outdoors even crowded environments. 

People don’t wear masks eating drinking indoors bud. possible vaccine affect people pervious covid differently? Don’t know, don’t care lalalala Yes no. every women where's mask ever go. Part driving outfit. Live country side air clear nice still people masks. Need amplify long term symptoms scare them. whoever needs hear this. actually kind normal. It’s good thing, immune system like hey know fucker. lasts couple days start concerned. least you’re area everyone eligible vaccinated

(canada btw) chains woke fuck. going 2022.  Big cities yes everywhere else no. second around 36 hours ago. Still fever it’s rough going day. Right 12 hour mark felt absolutely horrible. Hoping ends soon everyone else I’ve talked said went away fairly quickly. think economic societal consequences lockdowns restrictions comparable. probably wait studies published whether still carrier vaccinated. coffee test something like 77% accurate. Sniff spoonful coffee grounds. Smells like coffee? probably Covid. Oddly smell like coffee, almost certainly Covid. reading morning covid patients places India numerous right sharing covid unit beds. Europeans will, I’d imagine. Lol dude sub way masks would permanent rest lives indoors Ah ok. think that's fine. CDC recommending take shot. I’m getting tired articles tiny countries like 10 people fully vaccinated that’s supposed impress us. Yes. wear one airplanes, port potties, doctors offices, places generally feel gross. Target etc June, many states probably use free shots lure get tourists fly in. see Alaska talking already. true, typing response definitely occurred much privilege, affording fun hobbies home community (although, SW Florida lot affordable home...) obviously people privilege better outcomes covid.

It’s cheap one dose, better choice poorer countries. Miss friend North!! Hopefully, get back normal enough Canada open back US. Really miss going Stratford festival. Hmm, maybe ""get vaccinated still wear mask, possibly *until 2022*, even every adult offered two shots"" great message. """"Studies indicate even vaccinated people become ill, far less likely experience severe illness requiring hospitalization resulting death.""""

CNN numbers day like... 5,800 breakthrough cases, 74 deaths (so CFR 1.2% breakthrough cases), somewhere 6-7% requiring hospitalizations.

Aren't CFR hospitalization rates breakthrough cases set unvaccinated people..? Crowded markets, spring break beaches, crowded public parks, concerts etc. lack basic education something? high means 67%, linked person above. You’re missing point. 67% still decent, Pfizer/Moderna/Novavax/Covaxin levels. It’s like AZ levels. Brazilian study mentioned one 60% confidence interval? Yes exhausted first shot. brain fog symptoms. Marylander here, got first dose Pfizer yesterday, issues far, minor pain injection site. think they're actually going find examples like this. someone diagnosed 2 weeks second dose mean infected then. median incubation period may 5 days, there's pretty significant variance. Watch lot people turn infected shortly first dose longer average incubation time and/or waited really sick getting tested. 22 got first shot last weekend. LOL. Sure. ignorant downvoted you. dare logical? Gonna loading 'cetamol 'prufen next dose!

I read could interfere vaccine thing taken close vaccination time. recommend quick research taking them. except business owners people need work feed families 😒 I'm referring unable vaccinated them. 

While many (most?) folks lying antivaxxers, legitimately people can't vaccinated.  Show definitive proof transmission outdoors. waste time trying convince idiot? Even Florida plenty places mask restrictions indoors. none outdoors. 

And virus care stupid opinions. spreading quite efficiently. Even outdoors crowded places. get vaccinated mask f**k off. tolerate nay sayers almost year pandemic still asking proof look for. 3% adults America immunocompromised/suppressed. That’s lot people. thresholds lifting restrictions/precautions based case/hospitalization/death metrics like proposed beginning thing. blows. vaccinated? Compared Pfizer Moderna no, compared others yes I’m entirely sure be. still travel South Africa I’m 20 got first one 2 weeks ago. isn’t hard, expect us age group gets second LOL, bought total 120 KN95 masks meh.com fall early winter. Still have, probably, 50 left. 

I wear twice, least day apart. 

Husband wears Reebok mask times goes out, he’s playing tennis. 

But wears KN95 otherwise. got 1st Moderna yesterday [It'll sad doctors nurses develop PTSD covid-19 nightmare means first shot got yo body ready it’s working 30 percent whole population 50% adults.  Basically takes two weeks get 50% another 2 first doses effective. basically Memorial Day hopefully every state begins decline shouldn’t reverse point. Ah man, “Everything Virus” all, even vaccines save us now, super big bad mutated COVID coming!!! point.

They're making logical fallacy attempt ""gotcha"". Quad city area Illinois side great utilizing Facebook national guard seem less rock island county imported from? US exporting lot, unlike countries like India  helping others (although nothing wrong that.) pragmatic. longer virus allowed circulate greater likelihood another variant popping causing trouble.

The sooner start exporting vaccines poorer countries better everyone.

Biden following plan already place  Sorry losses Germany.

I've wondering J&amp;J efficacy well, since got shot 5th. I'm glad relax around people wearing masks wrong now, I'm still worried losing taste smell end one unlucky breakthrough cases Wow US great Who’s one? MN, can’t go retail establishment without mask. 

I second Pfizer vaccine early March. 

And still wear KN95 mask. Oh yeah dude walked bar drink maskless bartender made gesture put mask guy shouted “oh it’s ok I’m vaccinated.” Good news.

There's also probably percent people waiting get get okay doctor various conditions. couple family members (in 75+ group) fall category (e.g., cancer treatment wrecks immune system, doctor says effect). socially expected places though? Masks usage high Ireland really get many people refusing wear one, practically one outside. No. dangerous kind clots: here’s Mama Doctor Jones’s detailed explanation  Without match, would probably see salaries comparable PAs. Resident leverage think. Hospitals right dependent them. fear enough residents, increase pay lower it. Even competitive specialities, start see doctors prefer higher paying program speciality. reasoning fairly sound.

1. Israel's numbers point major dent cases weeks hit 50% total adult population, hopefully see reduction cases begin next 2-3 weeks (though understandably guaranteed).
2. current USA COVID numbers great (led states new surges), severe cases hospitalizations way down, certain regions major waves past (Texas) seeing case numbers hospitalizations (the latter important) plummet despite real restrictions.
3. Natural immunity offer protection, though likely less vaccine (especially variants), better none terms reducing rate transmission (r0 number) slowing spread overall.
4. Less spread = less opportunities mutate. Half adults US able resist COVID begin making lot harder virus spread soon, get better here.

I want us get 70%+ fully vaccinated, believe do, we'll see major changes USA. Yeah I’m still fine wearing mask post vaccine months, big deal 🤷🏻‍♂️ No, different types clots. AZ vaccine linked specific blood clots brain it!!! researcher did, video demonstrate that, contrary claims fools, breathe mask. 

Early pandemic, watched researcher vigorous activity, spoke moved, took four masks—maybe even five?—one other, leaving single medical mask face.

Masters degree holders know waiting Biden developed/approved boosters summer/fall rather Trump's original vaccines used now. They're convinced something wrong J&amp;J stuff recently help. it’s pain, it’s hot, makes skin dry breaks ppl out. bit ballpark I'll try estimate. Let's define Michigan's big surge February 24 April 9. could gotten averages wrong believe that's new cases lowest peaked.

On February 24, Michigan recorded seven day daily average 1,208 new cases, country average 68,604. April 9, Michigan went 7,614, country went 67,927.

This means country went 0.98%. without Michigan, *just* Michigan, two dates country would given us seven day new case averages 67,396 60,990. would decrease 11.10%. Michigan surge *huge* incredibly unusual compared rest country. Nah. started one man. name won’t mention. goal create chaos divisiveness virus. One person responsible politicization Covid. 

Yes. One person make difference. One person power use “magnetic” personality create culture “us vs them”. rather brilliantly. sick twisted way. work health authority, hospital staff able get appointments including work hospital. Oh boy, let's outlaw guns legal longer average redditor alive! 

I care solutions would somehow address insignificant problem media hypes up, worth cost liberty, period. never said that. made ridiculous scenario stupid little head. Okay, genius. see anyone say over. progress. people take fact summer waves mean there's seasonality, even though smaller considering susceptibility novel virus time locations nearly 100%. joking, referencing Trump's goal flattening curve Easter 2020 haha   Smallpox fatality rate 100s times higher deformed children. also didn’t mutate anywhere near fast. disagree last weeks ‘very strict’

Who said last weeks 'very strict'? understand helping others (IMHO) look still interacting (Canada, Mexico, UE, Japan) strictly self preservation PoV. kind self serving time.  Coronavirus? Pfizer got covered. 
ED? Pfizer got covered. want exactly, huh?

It sure sounds nice put way, always different story discuss actually means. chance could fly get spare jab? Seems like big deal? long send reasonable hour (not 3AM) gets word effectively. literally said idea specifics lockdown, make uninformed. agree wouldn’t argue uniformed claims. Great question. Perhaps ask member gay community don’t seek curb risk taking behavior, decide don’t deserve medical care. Fauci determine restrictions, that's role state governments. CDC recommendations CDC, director NIAID. went mass vaccination drive-through site well, said vaccinate thousands day. want say around 4,000 can't remember exactly. first appointment took total 30 minutes, including 15 minute wait. second took bit longer husband able get shot well go walk-in sign process, took probably hour tops. Incredibly efficient process, really impressed. read month ago despite lots infections India ‘paradoxically’ low deaths?

This pandemic exercise watching westerners count chickens hatch, again.  Crazy turn around good job biden/administration data doctor citing support recommendation?  Fauci trying best keep people getting really sick dying. Sometimes means 'tough love' message people want hear.

You want know stop wearing masks: Covid cases low country.

Either everyone right thing masking staying away super-spreader events, crowded bars (examples: South Korea, Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia, consistently low Covid numbers), 

or everyone gets shot (Israel).

The US far either these, Covid variants spreading like crazy Florida lots people congregated Spring Break without masks.

You right politician. Politicians never give 'tough love' messages. tell people want hear. “Could potentially”. 

An asteroid could potentially kill 30 seconds. don’t let lives revolve around coulds. made comparisons followed saying you’ve got idea specifics it, haven’t idea classify strict told go away actually work prove (despite fact can’t even tell define strict lockdown).

Strict lockdown = restrictions world longer period don’t think comparisons required know classify strict UKs lockdown strict first part schools closed, non essential shops closed etc. March things classify strict removed. countries impact that? EU countries curfews, impact UK

Comparisons required?  true say vaccine rollout UK slow? Ah alright, dont know much J J, mainly meant AZ.  appreciate question; confess similarly understand reaching conclusion. 

While could clearer, guess stating vaccine significantly reduces risk transmission, stop it. Perhaps argument semantics, equate term ""stops infection"" nearly 100% rate prevention subsequent transmission virus; similar we've seen reduction severe outcomes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything I've read suggests Moderna/Pfzier vaccines reduce transmission 90-95% individuals post-vaccination somewhere south manufactures (see, e.g., Yale). That's great progress. define ""stopping"" transmission disease may differ. Now, may remaining 5-10% risk infection, extrapolated across population truly nominal. suggest risk infection post-vaccination - even 5-10% - ""extremely, extremely, extremely low"". seen hard data point help reach conclusion, would love read matter reference. (As aside, I'd agree assessment risk severe outcomes following administration vaccines nearly 100% reduction.)

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, children 16 cannot yet vaccinated. means still LOT potential vectors current new variants continue circulating create additional opportunities chip away 90-95% effective rate. lot focus original strain harmful seniors/those certain comorbidities, evidence newer variants contagious amongst children. parent, absolutely informs continued assessment risk helps explain may cautious 20-something itching resume social life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, understand vaccine 100% effective, context matters, too. okay many current vaccines less 100% effective we've obtained herd immunity respect diseases. case COVID. least yet. completely rational would need continue taking additional precautions (i.e., masking) COVID for, say, measles. greater percentage population vaccinated - idea number - means, let's open things back up. I'm sure we've reached tipping point yet. Yeah, favor closing schools first wave. Mainly know going happen. data, unlike flu, kids germ factories COVID. Helps schools person taking CDC precautions seriously. teachers get vaccine protect themselves, crucial. 


Funny thing is, daughter actually really well online school, again, social skills deteriorated. back month half starting come back before. not, tried myself. made name looking PB Jar Soda lmao Antibody count still much higher vaccinated people people COVID Scratch reverse it.

I’m signed get AZ vaccine Tuesday...but gotta honest...I’m little scared media coverage lack efficacy, whole blood clot thing (even though sensible part knows risks infinitesimal). Well know man, people want lie get sick whatever. Im vaccinated I'm going live life It’s long. AstraZeneca used US, CDC recommendations pretty irrelevant. Amongst benefits, trial results suggest particular vaccine actually effective longer dosing interval.

Supreme court case Wyeth v. Levine confirms even FDA approval pharma companies shielded. know want bootlick big pharma, thought hated them?

Yeah, that's really understand. once-in-a-century global pandemic, almost 600,000 dead US--but many people seem *genuinely offended* us erring side caution wait vaccines finish rolling out. already found :) really hope so, man Thanks post!! scheduled first dose Wednesday!

Since then, I've deal chronic illness made every day life difficult, likely forever. I'm one ""lucky"" ones still lead pretty normal life. Surviving goal. getting even better.

I doubt it, trials already way &amp; teaching unions throw fit children vaccinated. expect August US jabbed time school. UK expect July that's expect jab adults. Maine anything like state, schools require testing, they’re catching ton asymptomatic cases. people usually test unless symptoms. makes kids’ infections look like artificially high % total cases.

As far risk/reward, think it’s definitely worth keep schools open. There’s also guaranteed harm reducing kids’ education quality virus poses little threat them.  Invoking fear, well easier perpetuate unrest amongst population order better keep control measures place without question. fucking problem:

1) people want wear masks, like ever, even though crystal clear work.

2) people want get vaccines, even though insanely safe obviously best way end pandemic.

3) people think virus deadly, even though killed millions people around world 500,000 Americans.

And three groups people. 

Fauci difficult spot idiots. getting increasing pissed annoyed people want anything end pandemic yet complain time. skip 2nd mRNA shot considered fully vaccinated, might eventually bar something. also studying long term efficacy single dose regimen, know long would last. solution increase taxes rich? people pessimistic &amp; obsessively keep track covid. us optimists usually drowned still worried.

If one month serious lockdown strict test quarantine requirements outsiders ""losing freedom"" part problem. good luck I’m well-aware challenges messaging entire public. Fauci isn’t going alone-he develops message whole team officials, scientists PR types. message chosen appropriate point pandemic, they’ve lost huge swaths public.

If they’re losing public trust, they’re behind curve. Trump isn’t President anymore, can’t blamed recent loss trust.

What uphill battle? We’re vaccinating rapid pace. Michigan peaked. “uphill battle” get hesitant people take vaccine. it? boasting normal things it’s safe vaccinated public do. Don’t accidentally talk vaccine over-cautious. Fauci scientist might think angles, figurehead, should. That’s support staff communications. They’re finally coming around this.

Do know better Fauci virology? No. know enough government realize we’re getting PR spin much candid advice expert? Yes. Yes fare pretty well. Recent outbreak one dose AZ UK care home resulted asymptomatic cases. fuck happened comments? find masks tv annoying, especially inconsistencies. One scene doors people around, lets run mask cause reasons. Next scene indoors strangers lets take mask off. NCIS new Orleans worst inconsistency bugs me.

Nobody wants microchipped prevent flu. Honestly, strict lockdown across world probably stop wave. Even countries using vaccine higher efficacy, idea they're going fare dangerous new variants. practically, CoronoVac - Chinese made vaccine, proving efficient vaccine there. able hinder virus fifty three percent time, two doses. Sadly, article note Coronovac also easiest obtain poorer countries richer western countries practically monopolized better faring vaccines. data effective across ages provided. stop wanting US become China.

Victory instead mean turning sort danger plane crashes shark attacks present — small worth reordering vaccines do. you’re vaccinated, Covid presents minuscule risk you, present minuscule Covid risk anyone else. car trip bigger threat, others. 100 Americans likely die car crashes today. new federal data suggests either zero one vaccinated person die today true experts believe vaccinated people still sometimes wear mask, partly it’s modest inconvenience reduces tiny risk — mostly contributes culture mask wearing. decent thing people still aren’t vaccinated. you’re vaccinated, mask symbol solidarity anything else. Funny government (Spain) keeps making quite lackluster promises. Last week said 70% population would immunized end August. region (Galicia) official target similarly unambitious: 60s end June. ban citizens entering, abandon them. country 350 million people, lockdown going work. People always break whatever rules are. member states high vaccine hesitancy probably even half june Okay real lockdown banned everyone entering (including citizens) hotel quarantining everyone coming country required mandatory negative tests like them, could able prevent spread.

Size country irrelevant. Getting second moderna shot afternoon, take Advil getting help arm pain mess something up? They're also islands little people compared US UK. particular reason countries like India Brazil cannot manufacture AstraZeneca vaccine? 

But do? reluctance seriously concentrated certain demographics—mainly conservatives, conservative men particular. don’t think conservatives literally incapable understanding nuances described above. It’s conservative media willfully undermines trust vaccines public health officials. play dumb, pretend like don’t understand nuance, suggest public health officials ill-intentioned.

and vaccinating amazingly, congrats guys well. edgy hear that? got vaccinated military told zero immunity second dose. Depends lived. areas local restrictions Christmas strict national didn’t go lockdown January.

Yes long time, course that’s relevant strict national lockdown talking far started Jan ended March. 

The reason decide bring load time weren’t lockdown avoiding point actually agree Jan March long time don’t want admit it. Thought actually getting somewhere see expected much go back original plan. Side effects headaches arm pain fever... death. stop wearing masks right?  “they” think flat percentage works here?

Good example IL rural people aren’t taking vaccines whatever stupid reason, cities chomping bit. 

Should cities suffer bumpkins don’t vax? past month case count gone up. last two days count gone down. Let's hope trend continues!  think poor language skills. Hahaha

I guess people want beam hope anything crushes gets DV. aren’t wrong maybe timing was.. hoping masks school would make kids stopped getting sick unfortunately work us! Kids germy AF. better Europe? Europe probably EU. receive enough vaccines fully vaccinate 79% adult population end June. Considering supply quite unequal among Europe, means quite lot countries ahead Canada then. overall extremely similar.  Michigan New York continuing decline.

Whatever trait India prevented everyone expected beginning -- exploding cases -- seem matter dominant variant there. Vaccination rolling slowly there's runaway outbreak, probably many times larger what's observed. go NYC suburbs live, there’s noticeable increase outdoor mask usage. Great, agreed start Fauci divisive. Exactly. second shot long term immunity. think must hit nerve sometimes. fiance got vaccine, first time felt pinch barely felt anything, bit pressure. second time switched, got pinch felt nothing. maybe second one breeze! Tee hee? ordered Florida fudge numbers?

Was refreshing too? Well media politicized day 1 pandemic surprising. I'm vaccinated, unlike make antibodies sars-cov-2. live area people rapidly becoming vaccinated government easing restrictions mask use, restaurant capacity, gatherings. Additionally, high enough percentage colleagues vaccinated wear mask work anymore vaccinated means longer stay home work I'm exposed COVID. heard they’re desperate emergency care great news- really don’t like optics US vaccinating children countries still 50+ age phases. might nuanced, makes feel bit icky. Hahaha. Wait, reads like think Biden charge state level restrictions months ago y’all screaming state level issue president* responsibility. 

Pick one. I’m right outside city Westchester wearing masks outside. mostly see masks stores. even like, bagel places pizzerias, smaller, people sitting tables eating without masks. Masks slowly becoming minority look here.  waiting computer clock hit midnight last night, got appointment first shot Thursday! think kind person article really talking about. plenty people sticking full isolation despite fully vaccinated - that's fearful. many people vaccinated still reason careful, that's one group. could also see someone gathering/event knowing attendees wanting everyone tested. Right forget kids get sick lot (I interacted child since child lol). makes sense see huge pain. quantity vaccine, distribution Israel better on.  

The system states shitshow. Anyone tried get appointments almost websites attest frustrating was. high risk population 65 least tech savvy, compounding problem. start scheduled anyone Medicare, large percentage risk population. Unfortunately zero national effort, everything thrown 50 different state governments manage.  actually agree you, try spin one guy ""the experts."" ""an expert,"" maybe important one, that's decisions based science made. They're made based consensus. anyone know US airport/airline staff considered front line workers opportunity get vaccine earlier, wait age groups? imagine may actually depended state, I'm trying get idea. He's done far, far worse provincial government. We've able go movie theatre restaurant since last fall, economy chugging along fine, workplaces open, hospitals running normal. that's - things looking good elsewhere Canada. even given that, look data, seems safe say done worse every single provincial government country. theorizing, appears legit idea, covid point probably react worse shot 1 since level natural immunity. Age plays big part too. I'm 24 hours getting Pfizer 1 nothing sore arm. know poor reaction related to? know egg allergies common cause vaccine reactions, that's problem mRNA may ok Pfizer Moderna. cool. J&amp;J vaccine paused right CDC FDA investigate rare cases serious side effects. getting vaccine soon probably Pfizer Moderna.  don’t see he’s lost credibility outside science denial crowd. 

Where get this? Wow thank you! essential worker Quebec = 30 year old got first dose 1 week ago. Cool, indication anyone using evaluate restrictions? I'd also point that's insanely restrictive system (allowing 3k cases entirety US per day), think matters because, knowledge, one power come said that's they're going look at. Happy proven wrong, course.  least two possible answers different questions asking, special case external RNA (or genetic material) going cell, general case 'an external molecule telling cell make protein'. 
Every time get infected virus genetic material (DNA RNA) goes cell, makes cell produce proteins virus needs make viruses. pretty much true every virus, even ones cause regular cold. Happens us time.  


The 'external molecule telling cell make protein' pretty much cells body communicate, figure what's going outside cell. eat something sugary, cell notices sugar outside, starts produce insulin. difference cell already knows make insulin, information stored genome.  


As far vaccines go, traditionally mass-produce something looks like outside virus, inject people get immune response, lot work takes long time. use mRNA, give cells body instructions build stuff us.

It's difference airlift bunch prefab shelters people need, flying stack instruction manuals building shelters local materials. consensus necessary tell us need wear mask times taking walk outside. That's common sense. 

Mandates require us wear masks outdoors time irrational. Dr. Paul Sax well respected, opinion carries heavy weight. Ontario continues better handling pandemic whole 80% world Right three low population rural counties California Covid tier allows this. county meets goals lower tier, increase capacity.   want make shit go like previous admin?

We need see we’re working anyone get vaccine. 

If 80% country gets it, different approach rural areas never 10%.  quantifiable marks. say something like - ok, less X cases per 100000 people open theaters wave blamed. Nobody draw line sand want risk blamed. saying - 2 weeks second dose take mask - no, proven try safe side  don’t think people claiming thank   formed opinion lockdowns literally zero evidence

I formed opinion evidence support opinion. nothing said since changed mind that. January 6th? Christmas NYE strict, opinion?

Nov 5th June 21st long time, especially given would second time restrictions put place. Also, even though restrictions 'eased' past six weeks, still much strict world. Every time sort ""cold symptoms"" (sore throat, mild cough, congestion, etc). would tested fevers we've fever free year. elementary aged kids ended 4x year far. Bye. states that, yes. However, scroll bottom page, clarifies ICUs 78% full looking *staffed* beds. husband got second Moderna Saturday, side effects taking nap afternoon mildly sore arm, husband sore arm felt like head cold bit Sunday morning. pfizer submitted like week two ago. current prognostications say assuming nothing went wrong, fda give authorization summer Managers definitely need make clear WFH vaccination eventually orthogonal. is, X date someone either eligible WFH regardless vaccination status, need vaccinated come in. 8 cases Covid-19 onset least 7 days second dose among participants assigned receive BNT162b2 162 cases among assigned placebo; BNT162b2 95% effective preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 97.6).

I'd seen several charts, worked backwards sources, best could quote.

As understand it, secondary sources reporting it, numbers 7 days give us 95% value (within margin provided).

I willing someone Sciences better tell otherwise. Though I'm exactly back licking doorknobs personally, I'd rather spread bad info. provided source first place. GOP screams reopening US, main reason opening up... care shit! bigger newer study says 10% patients incubation periods longer 14 says, 1% longer 20 days.  going India? Cases going roof, insane.  got downvoted oblivion day suggesting track celebrate “full vaccination” vs “total shots administered” I'm sure trying make joke really aware instrumental Fauci scientific research public health policy AIDS epidemic like 35 years ago, led NIAID almost 40 years.

His work *prior current pandemic* already reshaped clinical trials saved countless lives. already well-known, awarded, published, cited, respected work. led NIAID since 1984.

You're walking proverbial auditorium full physicians, scientists, regulators, activists, pharmaceutical reps, media, others who've listening expert stage since born immediately shouting ""who's *this* guy?"" first time coming door.

Have seat. percentage voters picked Biden correlates well worth vaccine uptake, seems like Democrats getting vaccinated Republicans Right, one answering question problem.

You telling that's Israel currently tell whether that's something case rate could stop - that's want see. 

Also, US cases fell last week rising steadily four weeks - likely hit peak head back here. mean... 

""But rural — Republican — areas, health officials said supply far exceeding demand."" - October November, average 38 percent Republicans told YouGov didn’t plan get vaccinated. March April, average 37 percent. Monmouth’s poll, 43 percent Republicans said would probably never get dose."" - three ten Republicans White Evangelicals say “definitely not” get vaccine, one five adults living rural areas."" - get youre getting at, pretty much every piece information available points conclusion: republicans need get vaccinated I'm still signed NYC second one. Doubt reject I'm week work thanks I'll try get keep things kosher People experience symptoms, bringing mom make sense. people pay federal taxes 

No shit. like second part too, ""Youth wasted young. Wisdom wasted old."" Fraudulent vaccination cards far away least concern vaccination effort. I'm concerned making effortlessly easy anyone wants vaccine able get vaccinated.   least state, younger people high-risk able receive vaccine yet. area specifically even start opening everyone week think? Man High Castle, indeed lol say Americans altruistic think.

Maybe complain actual vaccine hoarders world. I'll take different tack replies. According chart, NH supply constrained, state use 100% vaccine supply. Last heard, federal formula distribution vaccines, *isn't* based local demand — is, least delayed.

I'd say, then, combination (a) extra willing populace, (b) federal formula favors smaller states.

Expanding (a): NH one better educated, older, whiter, least evangelical, least ""hippy enclave"", (contrary popular belief) least ""libertarian enclave"" states there. details would point towards state going disproportionately pro-vaccine. state republicans take Trump way national ones did, there'd even less (but zero) adoption pandemic-downplaying commonly causes anti-vax sentiment too.

I'm glad university planning requiring vaccination fall. Even there's guarantee exceptions able made, everyone knows reach certain threshold vaccinations end August person classes happening. one wants blamed that. look statistics. Seriously, hundreds millions doses distributed. Risk assessment even healthiest individuals makes vaccination favorable based numbers alone. People die kinds reasons. There's reason deal automotive deaths wearing seatbelts, totally stopping use cars. It’s novel.

Real world data Israel suggest vaccines currently extremely effective blocking spread even effective preventing severe disease, means we'd able control spread without needing additional NPIs. assume true? new time come close vaccinating decent amount population booster shot required

How know need yearly shots.

Like subject completely ignored virus spreading endless amounts animals even begun consider mutations yet jump back humans that.

And? We'll deal problem it. Luckily covid mutate quickly amount complaining change reality situation take seriously yet, wait someone love dies see fast attitude changes.

Huh? one saying stop restrictions now, case sufficient % population vaccinated? thing is, virus actually mutates slower flu escpailly HIV.
The problem it’s spreading like crazy.
As people get vaccinated, number opptunites covid-19 spread mutate go down, causing negative feedback loop. major COVID vaccines going open source recipe / manufacturing process? truly global issue we're facing right now, variants popping constantly. sooner people vaccinated, everywhere, lower risk everyone.

Is particular reason countries like India Brazil cannot manufacture AstraZeneca vaccine? JNJ? actually withholding intellectual property purely business reasons? so, make scum? hope American vaccine manufacturing continues dramatically ramp spend next year two shipping doses planet. two doses Pfizer Moderna vaccines least 95% effective. CoronaVac around 56% effective. good enough, frankly I'm confident long term effectiveness mRNA vaccines inconsistently useful right away.

I think United States enough doses fully vaccinate everyone here, obviously allow manufacturers sell vaccines elsewhere, orders fulfilled really think begin giving countries would willing accept. right less fortunate countries rely vastly inferior medical technology. Regardless possibility mutations evading vaccines could effect us, think everyone deserves immunized. think right thing do, powerful country world would almost say makes United States' obligation. person disclose disability big no-no per ADA. 

Not context, since making exception opposite discrimination. That’s common word around charctirsts found 2 variants found 1
But BS fearmongerng word often abused(you call 2 Bai Raines impact) double vairaint. comment says ""very likely new variant"" that's issue that's feeding unfettered optimism, anyone else say likely much one can' say unlikely everything comes opinions one predict novel virus evolve even experts personally prefer assume worst keep easier remain vigilant opposed assuming best breeds compliancy.

Stay safe strong. want point finger anyone, point big pharma. open source COVID vaccines allow/assist lower income countries producing supply. unreasonable expect US vaccinate India, Brazil &amp; similar countries. big economies resources produce vaccines domestically. 1 50,000 from? idea person trial it? Well, they’re using sinovac, many got first dose. tricyclics low doses effective - especially amitryptaline. higher doses sedating low (10-20mg) doses stimulating. goes usual dose-response curve need find decent quack. right, fair comparison. even per capita, US far far far greater resources. Individual states counties US similar populations budgets several times higher. person disclose disability big no-no per ADA.

Not they're seeking exception due disability. It’s riskier drive get vaccine actually get vaccine still

I hear lot people saying this, seems weird. Let's maths out. I'll include drive back, fair. 

Vaccine: 20 deaths 20m, say. would 66 deaths scaled UK population.

A) (source: dept transport)

A) 1800 people year die UK traffic accidents. 

B) average 1.1 car journeys per day. Sounds low OK. Though 'car journeys'. Road accidents would also include bikes, pedestrians, ...

Anyway, that's 1800/365*1.1 = 4 people die traffic accidents, statistically, whole country 1 car journey back.

So trips get vaccinated we'd expect 4 people lost vaccination we'd expect 66 based know.

Any mistakes maths? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

They behind curve, facing uphill battle many fronts, especially people like think know better. anyone else cry got vaccine? me?

BioNTech could make partnership Pfizer instead keeping glory profit themselves? way demand much casual situations public. Yay, I'm part them! Huh, never thought watch stall like 73.7 :-/

then everybody gets mad. vaccinated expecting reward, non-vaxxers would yammer ""there restrictions, tEh NeW fLu, BrOh"" I'm LA County huge relief. really hope continues get better! whole family Michigan though, state worst, I'm bummed that. Ya say date make sense. say conditions remove order Young people general fine numbers young republicans terrifying covid America nutshell actually. think couple things play here. First, public health official, err side caution conservative safety measures truly enough science back relaxing policy. lax policy announced, never take back.

Second, hope messaging used encourage vax-hesitant crowd saying, ""hey, vaccines effective stop wearing mask get it"" keep vaccine uptake going strong. lot people attitude of, ""if nothing changes *for me*, what's point?"" might help address that. makes feel better, sarcasm readily apparent upon reading comment. Got lucky mother. 55+ community one guys isbretired FDNY works locks FD lot stuff like smoke detector installs elderly. connections, got county run pop-up Moderna back around late January. larger community, got around 300 65+. age lowered everyone, they've run another pop-up. Unsure numbers that, know community.

My bother got Pfizer via VA.

And low behold, 3 weeks ago trial site told I'm Active Group, I've actually vaccinated since November.

And yep, we're diverse household. 😎 Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J. vaccine never expected 100% effective death, even though trials incorrectly said so. trials combined something like 3 deaths 50 hospitalizations, course placebo arm. Even taking 50-0 split gives something like [97.5% lower bound efficacy reasonable bayesian roughly 10^-6 chance death. Meanwhile among 251 million unvaccinated people, 30,000 deaths last month (a dubious proxy vaccinated versus unvaccinated risk, sufficient make point), 10^-4 chance death. puts efficacy somewhere around 99%.

But actually vastly understates things, since first people vaccinated overwhelmingly higher risk, 10-100x so. news we're getting efficacy death overwhelmingly good.

In addition that, cases infected prior vaccination. Colorado, 20% deaths happen 30 days symptom onset. believe vaccines anything ongoing infection (sadly) surely accounts deaths. US trying exclude those, recent news Michigan shows. countries, Chile claim vaccination [80% effective preventing death 42 days first could easily account nearly deaths. (Side note: mRNA vaccines give efficacy [within others seem take much longer.) Gym? reading first paragraph, title fails tell correct story actual results... We'll reach point soon every American wants vaccine get one almost immediately. hold little longer! Demand still outstrips supplies many areas. 

like where? every US state.. except New Hampshire least 13% supply buffer delivered vaccines administered.... New Hampshire already way ahead everyone else terms vaccinated population 56% (nobody else 50).... Vaccinations decreased bit recent numbers, 

source please... think pandemic last forever? work VA hospital, given 2 days paid leave vaccine feel weather/have side effects. 92% employees work currently vaccinated. Yeah make sense all. infected 45 days vaccination still didnt die receiving vaccine. Like people need worry presymptomatic potentially months deadly symptoms start. risk

That's me, chief. conversation people's risk assessment skewed, calling covid ""non risk"" ridiculous. Almost 600,000 dead americans would disagree you, could. mean anecdotal? common knowledge. Wonderful nuanced attitude. Probably one legit well thought measured responses I've seen sub.  facts malleable. wrong, arguments based faulty logic you, assume, learned lesson this. Best luck, 小粉紅. Try take informed approach future I'm sure serve well. I'd like hear CNN article skewing picture. wife read article became super concerned. Patriot Act also supposed temporary. Spitting assault many places mean, said sounds like they're readjusting risk tolerance based they're vaccinated not. would try worry much people's risk tolerance is, gonna drive nuts. already one year early, although reason hide surgical mask fashionable cloth mask, alone trust enough protect myself. Hmm. like allocate voting machines. AFAIK things, problem population density. sheer scale requirement makes getting distributed enough people impact problem.
Add less adequate medical infrastructure issue becomes even daunting.

To fair though, even issues, give kudos due - atleast Tier-3/4 cities like right now, difficult seemed parents get first dose vaccination weeks ago. registration vaccination elders going well enough IMO time. 

Now hand completely different matter infrastructure crumbling huge influx cases... wearing seatbelt incredibly unacceptably inconvenient, unbelievably uncomfortable people. infringes personal freedoms put lives danger, top - can’t even breathe wearing it. 

/s GF roommate getting first week second Thursday. Let’s finally end shit completely untrue. Several states right seeing absolute increases hospitalizations young people beds now.  Now, great shape. Definitely great health worse off.  vast majority people US think healthy probably wrong definition healthy head.  level obesity south, example, incredibly high.  many folks think healthy? Get tested. Holy crap Florida actually functional MA! Florida 18+ now. early tell confidently. would extremely surprised vaccines ineffective it, since they've effective others.

It mutate far even virus, far vaccines work fine studied variants. mandated military president waives informed consent provision, law currently makes optional apply schools anything else. Stay hydrated. Dehydration headaches joke. I'm interested think number deaths higher without lockdown. seem sure it, current second peak higher.

Waves always form peak, exists mean lockdown nothing. curve always high point. downvoted multiple studies articles sub show masks work, zeroed one says don't. I'm saying coming bad faith, hard find studies show masks work.

My source googling ""mask studies."" get lot info immediately. Yeah, people need start understanding right states seeing increasing hospitalizations, young people hospitalized older crowd already vaccinated.  narrative young people end hospital true, data showing now. I’m sorry you’ve deal this. pandemic really torn mask (hah) lot people’s selfishness lack empathy. think hesitance many much apathy. friends university immediately got vaccine available (mostly) following good COVID judgement. people knew high school post pictures bars every weekend like nothing changed.

Maybe get lumped into""vaccine hesitancy"" see different phenomena. Small correction: delivers DNA, mRNA.

The DNA integrate cells' DNA, make way nucleus. similar mRNA vaccines point ""machinery"" nucleus read DNA produce spike protein, mRNA edge sense needs make way cytoplasm instead way nucleus. serious? might want start looking numbers states seeing increases hospitalizations.  Here's news flash you.  old people beds anymore states absolute increases hospitalized patients. Florida Michigan two them. mention J&amp;J? one care Johnson &amp;j law suits right now?! even... oh never mind. paranoid. decreased efficacy SA variant, still well protected getting infected, even slim chance do, EXTREMELY protected becoming seriously ill.

Still follow local health guidelines, that, try relax. worst behind you. So, I've wanting ask little bit, risk sounding condescending, guys comfortable getting vaccine? Originally plan wait year see results, effective brands, J &amp; J scare, I'm genuinely nervous get vaccine. want rejoin society pretend covid exist, plan eventually get vaccine right feels safer quarantine rather risk effect vaccine. Looking genuine insight, post meant condescending really want better understand thought process get place feel comfortable one vaccine options people risk death hospitalization small crowd. fact, probably young get vaccinated.  20 so, vaccine definitely worth it, trend right younger people ones hospitalized, particularly states absolute increase number people hospitalized.  narrative young people get hospitalized needs die (pun intended). that’s case, telling us still need wear vaccination? vulnerable, course everybody wore make protect you. less likely get infected much ask extend courtesy wear mask everyone else get chance get vaccinated well?  
Just shows, prioritize wrong people vaccination campaigns. Fun fact: Pfizer's Head Vaccine Research Development named Katherine Jansen. That's works. 90 something percent effective top current chance infected something like 40% even face face interaction. single shot, kept little outbreaks eventually gave everyone second shot. days shots separated years. vaccination much earlier probably lot complicated. may coincided large degree research viral vaccination (inactivated, attenuated, etc) works.

Hepatitis B vaccines another good viral example - modern either measles polio. given several doses good separation give ~lifetime immunity.

I heard another vaccine two doses close together besides COVID vaccines. reasoning putting close simply finish trials get vaccination completed quickly possible. makes sense. seeing immune response. someone already COVID, likely antibodies body respond hard fast encounters vaccine. COVID get slow, small immune response first shot since body antibodies yet. time second shot comes around, actually immune response due antibodies first shot. know it’s opposite people say do, that’s we’re leaving years time so. don’t patience stick around help fix state anymore. Rural MO always win urban areas, places like KC don’t even local control police department. There’s absolutely accountability anything state. Indians expert these... I'll fully vaccinated AstraZeneca end next month. still paranoid South African variants?

How much paranoid need be? work trades interacted hundreds, probably thousand tradespeople since last March never heard one say appreciate wearing mask work lmao. distain universal Yeah, opposite almost every state. good Democrats though, since rural population spread allows frequently win near majority state house districts there’s lot people fed virus think entitles believe whatever want... it’s tough situation world everyone cope. people know felt worse first 2nd shot alone, hopefully 2nd shot bad all. probably wont set date, like set % people fully vaccinated. literally thousands people dying covid per day. Every single thing extends long takes us get murdering people. don’t give shit process set prior, it’s bad one. happens people get blood clots know treat enough vaccines available? Damn people going need psychological help this, going grocery store vaccinated, lmao worked pandemic nyc took multiple roads trips around country, live pausing life year 99.98% non risk insane me. You’re understanding point read full context convo. Well say help stop spread they're kind implying help others. Demand still outstrips supplies many areas. Vaccinations decreased bit recent numbers, direct reflection loss J&amp;J vaccines. Extremist websites? don’t seem stable. Ofcourse good thing. rest world starts noticing us, ministers would spend time getting celebrities tweet outsiders interfere internal matter. already short time due constant gaslighting holding rallies. goal eventually drop mask mandates based percentage population vaccinated, ability get vaccinated, etc. dropping prematurely detrimental. ever many shots brand vaccine requires. Maybe booster CDC recommends. Duh went awesome 2-week trip Alaska years back wished could spend time there. making lot bad assumptions think there's slower vaccine uptake... JNJ 5% vaccinations whole... vaccines reserve next 2-4 weeks moderna/pfizer JNJ done period... 

we enough supply anyone wants vaccine next month... pausing going hurt anyone prevent anyone getting vaccinated... Appreciate it. 5 years now. noticable days ""oh, wonder would think"" moments.

Thankfully elderly mom got via county run pop-up 55+ community. second round 1+2 age requirement went down. vast majority neighborhood vaccinated now.

My older brother VA system got way.

And 3 weeks ago learned I'm Active group J&amp;J. Lol, I've ""fully vaccinated"" since November.

I think he's right. Related news hardly found major media western countries, front page level even world news session. volunteer testing centres since last year can't yes ideal scenario.

In place, step out, always masked.

Pfizer develop vaccine. testing manufacturing. vaccine called BNT-162b2 (BioNTech). ones produced Marburg labeled ""BioNTech"" instead ""Pfizer-BioNTech"" like ones produced Pfizer.

BioNTech could partnered every company able produce vaccines big scale. many alternatives BioNTech Pfizer already done projects past. (BioNTech also made contacts time Chinese manufacturer). partnership would give BioNTech bodies, resources, money, locations produce vaccines, thus greatly increasing vaccine production rate able distribute vaccine people. BioNTech also partnered Chinese company Fosun vaccine could distributed Hong Kong Mainland China well.

If BioNTech decided partner anyone, would struggle produce sufficient amount ""Comirnaty"" vaccine, people would wait longer get doses. every company created vaccine partnered another reasons. speaking rich countries. little optimism battling COVID countries like Brazil, Ukraine, African countries, etc. don’t access vaccines West/Israel does. that’s going huge problem soon. donated hundreds dollars help pay funeral costs American doctor probably born started medical school. even 30 comorbidity mild asthma far know.

These people lying morons, past year even sympathy Conservative/Republican viewpoint federal government past 3 months almost idea doing. people thought Fauci's incompetence Trump guess 3 months evidence need.l problem I'll going different college, hopefully. want paranoid meeting new people. can't wait said nutty anti-vaxxers start saying shit like ""See told scamdemic lie!"" Got well camping trip desert. still see scar. Everyone funded vaccine development. could see people putting mask feel sick possibly contagious issue, kinda like south east Asia. border open Canadians enter America, vice versa. want it. Canada started vaccinating 55 recently. one dose. Canada effectively stopped giving second doses. They're spaced 4 months apart. Glad part half received least one dose. Getting second Pfizer dose May 4th! 💉 tune way? pathetic ignorant thing I've read sub. whole point getting vaccinated protect YOURSELF. people take masks around you, vaccinated, exactly issue here?

I think deep think vaccine even works, hence ""uncomfortable"" people even know vaccinated anti-body status.

All statement leads believe victim fear doom shoved face every hour day last year. Caring child makes things exponentially harder. Might talking adults vs. total population. Half US adults half 78%, 39% total population, roughly line previous comment. Vapccinne You’re fooling anyone. I’ve see migrant workers Middle East live dorms , worker Europe lived dorms . It’s dorms. It’s involuntary restriction movement based come from. people expandable, work pittance sent home years. None rights naturalize well. dubai, guess Singapore likely story  Canada one best vaccination rates Western world right now, astonishing feat country produced single coronavirus vaccine. allowed compare Sweden country Norway Finland! Colleges likely require moving forward, similar vaccination requirements. make fair dent vaccine ""hesitant"" group.  sooner everyone gets vaccinated, sooner people wear masks socially distance.

Why saying shit like ""the real case made young people getting vaccine right want travel internationally""? trying get people get vaccinated everyone wear masks socially distances longer???? EU exported vaccines used themselves, including United States. Get fucking high horse. Ok. Really good numbers right course, really comparing country 778K country 332 million? every person Bhutan needs vaccinate, US needs vaccinated 426. 100 people vaccinate 42,600, reach greater per-capita percentage much quicker every dose. fair comparison countries similar population wealth. Also Israel struggling take mine off. Honestly got used pandemic thought feels surreal. constantly feel like tmr I'll see R number ride back 1 we're going start going lockdown again. started seeing people person things still weird me. one hand really believe vaccine really hate social distancing lockdowns, hand feel like actually reason, know feel ever. COVID also cause impotence.

This scare young men enough get vaccinated double mask. change changed mind again. mean ""don't touch smallpox vaccine""? think better fun summer; might that. **April 18, time last year, Americans looking forward family gatherings, sporting events, eating restaurants, even movies theaters again. even millions getting vaccinated initial formulations Pfizer Moderna, evolution spike protein SARS-CoV-2 virus continued microscopic arms race cutting-edge medical science. social exuberance Spring turned grim reckoning strain India didn’t care vaccines, held cells invaded surprising molecular twist set vaccine researchers scrambling. girlfriend parents, fortunate, gone full plague mode. bunkered holiday house one servant nobody allowed leave house. Shopping done delivery contact delivery guy rest. shopping bags treated vaporized disinfectants UV light chamber brought servant allowed contact family. insane. Sooner later social pressure.

No vaccine equals

No travelling

No hotels

No flights

No dining out

No job interviews

I can't wait till morons find what's what. got second dose Friday. Let tell ya, Saturday SUUUUUUCKED. I'm fully vaccinated! 😁 wish could find again, remember reading bathroom vents (in US) designed air never flows backwards (i.e. back inside bathroom) even vent off. crazy worried year ago finding information gave peace mind. Without lockdown???? How???? moon!

Oh great, another side effect afraid /s

In seriousness, wife fully vaccinated, parents brother. They're coming week hangout. Today daughter's 1st birthday parents met once, brother met yet. cannot wait. soon ease guidelines vaccinated people, unvaccinated people also stop following restrictions there's way enforce double standard two groups can't tell apart. So, improve quality life vaccinated people, increase transmission among dishonest unvaccinated people raise risk honest unvaccinated people. can't apply common sense situations involving agents common sense. Low risk getting seriously ill dying, yes. high risk pressuring public officials keep restrictions place long case counts head steeply downward. want normalcy, everybody get shot. Great! Good luck! officially got shots even though 2nd kicked butt little, I'd happily regards making sure can't get covid again. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

There flaws PCR test methods fly certain areas.

April soonest Pfizer could apply - would expect see day. Whether like it, true.

The issue lack accessibility. especially ashamed themselves

More 100 milion vaccinations done amd 110 milions exported.

Meanwhile,the Us exported less milion.

Also, Israel UK countries much better US Lmao Facebook. scientists like dr.Fauci? He's lied us before.... everyone else mentioned, risk probably low, even without vaccine. 

Don’t feel bad nervous! It’s difficult habit get of. still catch worrying sometimes too. Biontech Pfizer lmao Well people concerned US get 75 percent uptake needed herd immunity virus maybe Canada ok long run Sore arm day 1. Getting number 2 2 weeks  hope succeed. world needs mRNA vaccines. That’s takeaway well don’t need numbers expert smell bullshit  something people seem forget. way get someone actually symptoms unaware public... rare. every single human besides carrier.

Sorry, Guam. Politics. Makes sound like government actually something. Actually Trump delayed bunch vaccines December partisan badly US handled pandemic last year kind refreshing see us hitting park vaccine roll out. much Capacity Restaurants do? 50? 75 percent? dumb. author study, Dr. Emmanuele A.

That's advertising need vaccination campaign, saying. hope teens 12-16 next. depressing part - NYC inverse problem like many open slots little takers. Granted weekends hard get weekdays, plenty slots even april. register system, get appointment though. Don’t forget it’s free!

FREE GOOD

I like free AZ numbers starkly different though; Scandinavia clot rate something like 1/100,000. Nobody explanation would higher J&amp;J would lower AZ. 64 year age span course 16 months? That’s 100k ppl so. sure died reasons time. San Francisco said twice many drug overdose deaths covid last year. Also fact even thinking treatments covid, vaccines. treatments? get vaccine ""risk death""? Whats that.

And fact still know lot vaccine themselves. Even facts sheets filled ""we sure's"" ""unknowns"". Waiting J&amp;J available again. within month so, I'll get 2 dose. I'm aware contraindications even people *are* diagnosed autoimmune disorders. yes, talk rheumatologist. That'd great. Pfizer submit application age group 16 well? Good luck long covid possible underlying heart damage authors specifically say rates found compared, small sample size events control demographics. Like vaccinated people still wear masks outside. able walk appointment weekend first dose moderna. 23 - Connecticut. Made super easy, another walk event scheduled exactly 28 days later. 1.	Again, long term effects usually seen risk older people. Yes young people get them, common. Saying get vsccinated without giving fuck long term risks actual vaccination seems like dumb argument me.
2.	agreed, extreme short term side effects nothing sore arm, im worried these, even nauseau tbh.
3.	 Agreed one benifts vaccine protecting others, decided first priority shouldn’t whats best family? Characterizing making family priority selfish correct. fuck tell body? Yea biggest thing embarrassment it. recognize signs sometimes keep bay. sitting bunch people I'm sweating pale skinned trying pass really uncomfortable. Meh. risks associated AZ vaccine overblown. people take much bigger risks living everyday lives; even without taking pandemic account. paranoid boomers want it, I'll happy take one hands. willing drive east north bit Sac, almost certainly available appointments daily neighboring (more anti-vacc) counties. lower average IQ, appts available. Dude you’re almost likely get hit bus get killed corna 15, live life got J&amp;J last week. one painless shots I've ever gotten, arm hardly sore getting it. However, next day, got 101 degree fever severe body aches lasted two days.

Still better getting actual covid though! I'm 36 ran get vaccine first opportunity came up. known people infected died COVID, wait get vaccine. NC retail pharmacist here: list get shot. need citizen, wouldnt give shit either way, make fuss. adults need adults get vaccinated. well havent second dose yet arm pain first dose felt bit nauseous next day. everyone reacts differently vaccine. entire family fully vaccinated single one us issues all. Maybe unique, doubt it.

if anything sounds like lie this. one effects virus? even soreness? literally everyone know taken covid vaccine atleast mentioned soreness arm nothing else. 

anyway ok listen anecdotes long youre aware theyre anecdotes. know it. want know numbers misrepresenting reality. No, outside now. Groups 6 max. vaccine going waste, used fast be. change age 40 Ontario Alberta, even fixed shortly. Woo! Look doublespeak! Amazing.

Ah!Let counter you? live know going die?

Fauci offers possibility life without suffering sickness virus! accept it, want life? Canadian, first time since I've alive, envious Americans. Fauci? Wearing Plague Doctor costumes. heh, ""plague walkers"". That's good one. public checkpoints examined one dogs going indoor/crowded spaces. I'd argue getting signed vaccine once-in-hundred-years pandemic ""drop everything right now"" situation, understand point Yeah unreal easy way get vaccine right now. Walgreens/CVS/Rite aid let book week away. got mine way BFE Pennsylvania, drove 45 min get it. Like seriously I'd rather able get CVS website schedule like month instead checking every day availability comment made look calendar curiosity realized 2 weeks second dose birthday, fun!

It’s experimental still trial.
Unknown long-term effects.
No liability protection.
And more!

I’ll pass. thanks! According U.S. Centers Disease Control, 77 million vaccinations U.S., 5,800 vary based dominant variant given country. also vary based vaccines used. US mostly Pfizer Moderna. still data indian variant supposedly two immune escape mutations. India uses Astrazeneca/inactivated virus vaccine already high efficacy mutations. pretty serious mental fogginess 2 days never could've taken exam. way. people don’t even acknowledge there’s race. call “hoax” Yeah, hold anything her. really opinion pregnant women getting vaccine one way other, wanted mention probably reasons super antivax That’s thought, wanted ease anxiety. Thank you! Fauci make easy says things like ""this nothing liberty"" regular basis. Saying shit like enrages conservatives. I'm extremely pro-vaccine libertarian, Fauci makes furious. think Fauci's comment liberty fine, even agree it. also admit comments like intensely controversial. almost like wants turn conservatives, like wants convince following public health advice giving nanny state.

Frankly, Fauci needs go. terrible communicating health advice public. want convince conservatives get vaccinated? Get Rand Paul air say get vaccinated longer wear mask. EU #1 exporter 110 Milion vaccines exported believe political yahoos tell vaccine's safe. hospitals larger cities *have* near capacity since surge peaked. 

Also, imo, lockdowns preventative measures risk variants developing + fewer people long term side effects. Yes. Let’s go!  Fair point! can’t see reason C19 significantly flattened Europe UK Canada summer come back vengeance fall charitably assume mean alert ""drop everything right now"" situations, vaccine rollout exactly example. used emergencies, people might tune alerts (including emergent ones) Got mine last Friday. sick af Saturday bit less yesterday. Take easy shot, hydrate, stock gatorade, etc. good luck! I'm interested longer term effects 5yr+ effects. get always get later long term effects known best metric use would rate new infections, that's hard pin down.

Test positivity rates death rates probably best proxies have.

Personally, think long COVID-19 still top 10 leading cause death, we're woods yet.  Lol good luck consider probability 1) person covid contagious 2) caught despite pretty great protection one dose moderna, risk seems basically negligible. 

I know easier said done, stress out. good. Yes. I'd say people supportive restrictions. UK variant caught us surprise spread fast. people recognise little choice lockdown till control.

Recently debate started whether we're opening fast enough. Given low covid numbers good vaccine progress feel could opened faster (it's staged approach 3 months ish) think Swindon would first choice. lot different know feeling like crap actual illness defined end point actually sick. know, US best quality healthcare world

Said nobody ever thought 2 weeks 2nd dose 3... Meanwhile Canada... That's me. drive-through mass vaccination site took two hours got left. state opened general eligibility, every pharmacy hospital driving distance booked weeks.

While took 2 hours get vaccine, probably vaccinating two three people every second mass vaccination spot, day. total throughput must staggering, compared individual pharmacies. basically opening private market 18+, retaining government subsidized free vaccines 45+. right vastly greater danger posed covid, need protect others. might want take tone notch. know lot people argue bad faith, think person one them. It’s bad over, many won’t even able experience relief, joy, gratitude thanks politics mean, eh?

It made way harder high risk person access vaccines timely manner completely skipped period high risk people state. Shut discriminatory turd.  people also stop following restrictions there's way enforce double standard two groups can't tell apart

I tell someone lives midwest, group people taken covid procedures seriously since christmas. suspect lot got holidays like ""welp already antibodies so..."". current projections EU adults fully vaccinated sometime Q3, although uncertainty (primarily extent AstraZeneca J&amp;J used). course, that's given. system government have, nearly impossible this. fact. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Congrats buddy!!! issue fully vaccinated people spread virus. Yet still told mask. People really rather get people sick kill rayher wearing god damn mask.... Covid killing people asymptomatic cases 45 days later. adverse reaction vaccine soon recovering plausible. 1. study patients hospitalized mean age 60 years. severe cases COVID skew old sick—not 20 year-old athletes.

2. announcement research conducted.

3. Many symptoms study self-reported.

4. people received lung transplants, small minority COVID patients. also typically impacts severe COVID—not young healthy.

5. shows asymptomatic people’s organs damage COVID infection. indicate long takes heal infection. people don’t really see getting vaccinated change anything better

I really don’t understand anyone still think this. Even someone cares what’s them, getting vaccinated drastically reduce chances getting Covid almost eliminate chance hospitalized. Even don’t care getting Covid, public health does. people vaccinated, less people get sick even less require hospitalizations. Oregon may put exact numbers it, getting vaccinated obviously help metrics they’ve said care order lift restrictions. Korea mask usage outside close 100%, people kinda used wearing masks even since air quality great times year. (Which btw something think parts us could learn from... Like lived SF looked like bladerunner outside couple days wildfires nearby...) Sorry still believe I’m getting first dose end year Germany. It’s complete mess get appointments. People receiving f*cking letter month invitation get vaccinated could book appointments June. Meanwhile 60s old refusing AZ vaccine.
The bureaucracy killing people Europe “lucky” got South African British variants. P1 Brazil would corpses laying around people dying home. Also half-assed lockdown slowing removing freedom helps nothing. Summer like New Years eve Mexico Brazil without vaccines. would nice. I'm letting fully vaccinated mom come within 10 feet unvaccinated kids though, made priority go back church removing mask upon entry encouraged welcomed. Twice week. 90% efficacy 100% efficacy understand that. issued emergency use authorization, never FDA approved. Also, Moderna tried issue 10 vaccines they’ve never FDA approved. wouldn’t plan take one. single lie comment There's guy farther comments claiming delayed covid death. load trash. think need careful vaccinating recently infected people. UK proves vaccines delusions. solution problem. reschedule 2020 weekend wedding xD. see anyone married shirts, probably haha timer set? 6 weeks Friday. egalitarian country like Sweden single women able give donations also. testing regimen vaccine rigorous one other. fact, study done 40,000 subjects opposed required 10,000 subjects, state vaccine “NEVER” tested inaccurate spreading lie. approved FDA, you’re lying one well. case counts going fall Texas instead flat, effects game would invisible. can't impregnate sock though... 2 open spots pod Friday anyone looking. \mm/

I love summer camp. awhile. right, problem study. used healthy samples covid samples. good chance dogs smelled sick general already knew could do.

If going make distinction cold covid that's fine, also use finding people test nothing suggest differentiate covid flu. Well employers require everyone vaccinated? Even widespread 'vaccine IDs', employers still HR require proof vaccination. can't lie - case there's reason mask. Aside slight awkwardness public mask them. Sure. Also, would go ahead cycle two masks. Another way also hang wall, sun light deactivates virus too. 2021 actually username worries me. :) contract literally says ""delivered 2021"".  meant ""in terms end result weight"" like said last post. first post also included link discussed impact burning additional calories clarify meant. Okay real lockdown banned everyone entering (including citizens) hotel quarantining everyone coming country required mandatory negative tests, actually enforced mask wearing like them, could able prevent spread.

So I'm saying UK point view, two countries similar issues.

By early March, COVID really getting news, know IFR incubation period, UK likely tens hundreds thousands cases. was, metric, much late international travel restrictions make much difference. US similar situation.

There sufficient testing capacity start pandemic. Even symptomatic people able get tested unless case severe.

There also massive shortage PPE, governments made call enforce mask wearing public could first try supply healthcare workers. got second moderna shot. Lucked ..only sore arm shots. I'm ready higher peace mind summer. Can't wait see plummeting cases. think they’re saying school open full-time since August, - 8 months later - large spread infection class. Sounds different me. want people get vaccinated, can't act like means masks distancing forever. 

So much this. infectious disease experts respond questions literal manner. asked directly vaccinated people spread disease answer honestly ""we unsure, possible, therefore vaccinated people take precautions, mask, distance"" something like that. reality say ""the likelihood transmitting disease vaccination incredibly low good go"" 


They careful completely say certain uncertainty, waiting certainty waiting forever. week one first times I've seen republicans democrats state agree, however, subject matter terrifying. agreeing CDC wrong, dont need implement measures this. agreed public health. looks like vast majority EU first shot end June.  


It really tortoise hare, UK expecting mop 18-30s dose mid late July, despite early lead. race mind EU ramp next months scheduled impressive. may responsible increased morbidity seen cases Brazil. 
And ADE seen reinfections, definition. Umpreeeeeys let's goooo! Without covid, they'd playing summer camp weekend.

That said, vaccine wife. someone pod wasnt able get one yet, I'm sure still wants come. Taking much regardless affects people foundational idea behind capitalism. working teacher Germany actually somewhat prioritized, there's 100% chance get one July/August. even not, chances pretty good. I’ve already first shot last week, completely different location work. Trust me, talking pharmacy time Covid past year, personally slacking ignorant slowing things like you’re implying. btw, pharmacy offered Johnston Johnson aren’t anything. doesn’t change fact people still waiting appointments. friend enthusiastic demand state high, couldn’t get shot scheduled two weeks mine still hasn’t gotten it. shot doesn’t mean stop caring team members haven’t secured yet, want customers treat right. 

This problem I’ve noticing discussions. Somebody point mask safety practices still protect group hasn’t fair chance yet. somebody else come along offer advice reply poster good go. That’s great...except we’re talking groups individuals, you’re like me, you’re even part group you’re pointing out. mostly 40 50 year olds. really 17 year olds. I'd rather err direction instead one. first dose confers little immunity roughly 2 weeks receive it. 1/3 eligible Americans fully vaccinated. full vaccination process takes 4-6 weeks. Wearing masks still decent thing do. thing happened US. Early on, Biden making modest promises, like Americans vaccinated end summer. People outraged; ""Surely better that!""

Turns could better that. did. want make promises follow on. Rip band-aid off, vulnerable already vaxxinated messaging miss information surrounding ""vaxxines work wear mask"" dangerous could prolong pandemic.

If messaging ""get vaccine wear mask"" would win fence sitters. Anti-maskers never converted stop trying. Shit article. Normorial Day Last month finally able memorial service grandfather died covid last march. requested vaccinated people attend met cemetery first. Maybe 20 people together. first time seen year. stood minutes like....is ok hug? this?

Also everyone except parents first time met daughter 18 months old. Always makes think “double secret probation”. Hope right. I'm planning moving late July early August Germany I'm vaccinated. Hope get in! vaccinated doesn’t mean immunity all

Lmao fuck get fuck misinformation.

Vaccines give 80% immunity first dose, better get vaccines diseases. give visa then? :( yeah used buy that, 2nd shot effects LESS covid? equal stronger. Water humidity also excellent breeding grounds bacteria. last thing want mask make sick something Covid! could taken approach South Korea allow citizens long term residents quarantine home, actually enforce it.  doubt many folks’ desire keep locking actually anything virus. Unfortunately already late that, least late Tuesday (once week's allocations announced). takes least 2-3 weeks allocations actually turn shots arms. unlikely state going meaningfully supply constrained 3 weeks (especially JnJ pause lifted Friday). 

All current supply constrained states chugging along ~4-5% eligible population incremental first doses per week. Three weeks 65-70% eligible population vaccinated supply constrained states. 

The challenge maintaining pace vaccination get 65-70% vaccinated increases. asking 15%+ remaining unvaccinated population show get vaccinated population applied least effort get vaccinated. 

It would meaningfully helped re-allocations started 3-4 weeks ago became clear states able consume supply, point water bridge. 

In states - power allocate however see fit. definitely opportunity get better intra-state allocation. said, strain thinking around rural populations vaccine hesitant COVID-vulnerable (less self-protective behavior, poorer health, limited healthcare options) and, therefore, over-saturating areas may better public health policy terms aggregate harm reduction makes easier vaccine hesitant population get vaccinated. political nonsense though. disgusting, hope judge throws whole damn book them. people like shit like this? morals damned conscience? nothing normal lethal pathogen tearing population. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

You get save people giving others, risk death, health complications. free give health anyone else's. ... along people “social distancing” years March 2020, don’t want dreams locking everyone forever end. exclusively look 7 day rolling average. Numbers slight downtrend nearly week, we’re lower April 9th.

That’s nearly 2 weeks without increase daily cases. absolutely qualifies plateau. 40%? Lol 

Weird, Peru haven’t even reached 1 million 32M~ South Korea 500 daily cases population 55 million still ""level 3"" social distancing. keep mind UK currently planning fully reopen (including nightclubs etc) June aggressive think lot countries fewer cases. Rep. Jordan dimwit share concerns restriction. CDC come say, ""When cases get X &amp; X% people vaccinated state, recommend lifting mask mandate."" gives people hope &amp; help people stay objective times. establish equivalent COVAX, ""COCUM"" people world donate cum Sweden  Ask qualified medical practitioner, Reddit! Great point.
And add states opened everyone April 19th like New Jersey, Massachusetts, city Chicago. coming months data iron out. 1 50,000 from? idea person trial it?

In danish-norwegian study astrazeneca found 1 40.000 developed unusual vitt syndrome. feel vaccines always endgame true herd immunity besides fake herd immunity countries tried approach without vaccine. long others take shot (and probably often people lax taking flu shots) continually, odds spread go odds catching go down. feel confident vaccine mask even though mask made feel comfortable times people susceptible sneezing closed spaces (mainly simple cold allergy rather deadly virus). Like people pre-2020 March let one rip, wiped mucus face, went business.

It’s going hard I’m sure we’ll slowly adjust back people’s noses mouths long vaccine hiding behind them. feel way confident gambling odds favor vaccine vaccine piece cloth may may work. flu vaccines even lower odds, this. True, something want get, vaccines help bodies defend it, people vaccinated still relying masks defense better.

True, mask vaccine justified overkill good things come end eventually (mask use, is). anything, good EU catch EU countries already announced open UK tourists early May, last thing need another spike spread returning tourists. Vaccinated doesn’t mean immunity *at all.*

Immunity doesn’t become apparent trials 12 days first dose. opportunity give people another three weeks second dose maximum safety.

Have empathy god’s sake. Injection site soreness “Covid arm” different. injection site soreness immediate immune response causes soreness within first couple days. “Covid arm” occurs 8 days injection thought allergic reaction. doubt long-term effects people, understand we’re beginning study these.

My issue assertion healthy young athletes lives permanently altered this. people studied this? Usually older sicker people. Even we’re trying determine long-term effects COVID, there’s reason believe it’s life-altering typical mild case, especially young people. get people things like think there's kind benefit it. I'm wondering think they're accomplishing get unless think 2nd dose magical one gives immunity something first one bogus something? know. wonder define school spread honestly. sister lives county children show positive kid’s classroom. school informed parents left decide wanted test kids. possibly capture whether transmission school case?

Also, ever school county person August. schools family goes hybrid while, 5 day optional, recently classroom close fill. ain't hok... vaccines aren’t going return things normal what’s point?

I think OPs description entirely accurate, dont understand take either.

The point vaccines make things *better*. They're time machine 2019. reduce number dead people, prevent hospitals overrun, help prevent variants. *aren't* magic wand.

Hell, even know yet many people consistently insist getting vaccine. Different things happen depending high low number really is.

Vaccines path forward things normal. instantaneous, need see actual results working, variants emerge, especially strong immunity holds long boosters needed.

I'll fly year well, mask. big deal. concur, Doctor? keep close look delivery schedules Belgium, barely chance case, lest AZ J&amp;J suddenly start matching Pfizer's delivery mind 11m habitants, 8m need vaccinated immunity. Idiots. absolutely expert questions genuine snarky.

Doesn't insulin cost like $3 vial produce? insulin Canada cost like $40+ insurance (ie Canadian)? profit go toward subsidizing cost insulin Canadian citizens?

You spreading misinformation.  mods remove garbage comment First, one becomes next governor Florida... it’s Senate. GOP voters love business-savvy “do whatever takes” attitudes. 

Really hope get maximum sentencing it’s much deserved. Especially considering article states caught bragging money social media. Disgusting.  read Europe catch UK coming weeks. Slow start wasn’t ideal glad they’re catching up. love see many places US teachers union safe. get kids back school now. /s actually believe dreck, never get motor vehicle reason. everyday dangers vastly higher catching diseases vaccinated against. realize tourism sucks too. comparing anything? reply wrong comment? know efficacy works entertained link confirm knowledge correct, is.

the video says ""each vaccinated person 95% less likely get sick time exposed covid""

that still add 100% protection, kids unvaccinated high risk factors involved, I'm risking it. 

if mom covered 95% efficacy kids _also_ covered 95% efficacy, that's another story makes virtually impossible get sick importantly, severely sick. I'll wait fully vaccinated instead risking someone visits anti-masker mass congregations twice week.  staying home work!

I DESPISE people think cool come office w/a cold early stages flu. still absolutely baffling people brush virus hearing countless stories type lung involvement COVID bring. correct stating kind lung involvement ('ground glass opacities') *not* rare, feature predominantly elderly patients? People act like happens either extremely rarely, elderly patients frustrating.

Imagine willing risk *lungs* inability perceive correctly evaluate risk. fear mongering. /S Vast majority survive. replacements. /s ignoring fact republicans literally caught saying wanted spread kill liberals make money of?

Oh wait allowed say truth here? don’t think “absolutely sure”. spread schools, don’t worry! unvaccinated family members definitely can’t get it. didn’t even check ID Colorado Walmart several states openly say give undocumented they’re checking either. Emily Oster every professional incentive downplay spread schools. She’s saying months schools safe even wrote Atlantic article last month saying parents consider kids “basically vaccinated” go vacation. got defensive actual public health experts criticized message questioned data. 

 ever admitted school spread problem would undo everything she’s spent year claiming. I’m saying she’s wrong moment, school spread may still incredibly rare problem. longer trust implicitly this. Plus sold vaccines countries improve world image vaccinating people. problem countries, like UK vaccine yet offered free-for-all, healthy young large offered yet, chance accept turn yet. release restrictions vaccinated, probably good chunk younger healthy people (whether would accept vaccine not) decide restrictions apply either, since would consider much personal risk virus. YMMV. fair assume states require form ID. speak NY require form ID prove residency proof employment. strict checking ID depends entirely facility go to. I've seen remdesivir working even given first days symptoms. also tried favipiravir. still cant figure work not. patients get better quickly administering either remdesivir favipiravir doesnt care throw half antivirals them. also noticed 80+ yo usually withstand disease better (low number hospitalized people even lower deceased) 55-75yo patients. Dont know immune system recognizes virus what, dont 80+ yo hospitalized, all.  Got second (Moderna). Felt achy, one day. 77 million people vaccinated 5800 tested positive. vaccines work incredibly well measures taking prevent transmission fully vaccinated absolutely overkill. extremes far frequent think are. They're majority sub anti-lockdown, lockdowns fact work incredibly well needed. fact chances ideologically anti-lockdown, formed opinion never read study topic life. exact experience second Moderna shot. like pull everything ass sources lmao fucking insane? live south people better rural areas never closed month two businesses bullshitting stay open.

Also everyone know got covid said thing also bullshitters going church, restaurants, wearing mask house others come over, inviting family over, etc etc. Liars. Liars over.

No one usa took shit seriously except people. know anyone two us YET INSIST FOLLOWED ALLLLLLL RULES. almost like keeping schools close hindered spread disease school age population.

Who would've thought? I’m trying point person replied point; end it’s political figures’ person power’s mercy.

I also don’t like metrics tied hospitalization approach. It’s going sine wave (hospitalization mask + people stay indoors hospitalization mask people go out, repeat) vaccination completely fulfilled; I’d like tied vaccination rate solely that, especially since vaccines available. 
Tying metrics going happen it’s always going mercy politics end point, probably first person replied saying well.

**Fully vaccinated people basically spread virus even get infected**. Thank you. appreciate common sense understanding. People need take breath look place reason like Exactly. get it. absolutely zero fear flu land hospital leave long-term issues still get flu shot flu really sucks would like avoid it. 

With Covid potential risks lot higher flu get vaccinated? reasons I'm going detail here,

You tease us!  Chicago thanks Springfield sites well, 10x easier drive place appointments always available deal Chicagoland. I’m terrified end mask mandates ended community spread. reason feel comfortable bringing unvaccinated children anywhere everyone masked. see unmasked people go away them. ended mask mandates would go back lockdown kids get vaccinated. Vaccinations endgame. things normal, society break down. rate vaccinations US high even increase spread, it'll well overtaken speed vaccinations. 

If vaccines get us this, we'll get natural herd immunity people going take longer, matter stage outcome always virus loses. 

I blame people caring like 14 months, shutting 99% save 1% goes far, there's limit much we're willing give up. Meanwhile Europe Covid permanent, going back 'normal' wonder many people would leap anti-vax group handed stimulus check 2k second shot.

That would stop pandemic immediately, least US. Yea found mothers ass. ya go. Douche. limited data collecting want info research.side note: SOOOOO offended calling anti Vaxer whaaaaa. guess I’ll give bullying possible expense child/pregnancy. You’re real hero. Round applause “justified” bullying everyone! 

On opposite end, show data shows impact pregnancy, menstruation unborn fetus? CDC doesn’t know actively collecting data seems well versed matter. Teach me. Fuck wanting wait safe socially distancing. I’m selfish We’re transition period doesn’t know yet. Look angry right treated entire pandemic tried treat everyone like adults tell knows. information changes reports that, angry right isn’t smart enough understand no, didn’t lie, information changed. 

Until right stop purposely keeping voters dumb angry, it’s hard Fauci speak openly he’ll vilified it, science necessarily means changing opinion new information comes out. political party whose spent years demonizing science education, end purposely keeping voters uninformed. 95 percent number mRNA vaccines means 90-95 less likely getting infected compared someone unvaccinated. talking about? That’s literally job vaccine they’ve shown confer robust immunity one dose. Right, right. They’re content stay isolated little countries. must it! Man love people voting me.

What normal situation imagine someone stabbing full something syringe without talking without consent?

Sure someone knew said ""I'm giving vaccine"", wrestled ground forcibly gave I'd beat crap them... without saying anything, know person? That's serial killer territory. mask excuse worst move.
We children Governments communicated masks needed health system encouraged general public make wear homemade masks.
It could saved much confusion arguing. idea vaccines variants? One dad's friends currently back India. know waited got fully vaccinated go back I'm worried nothing. Great hear New York Times. tide turning media messaging? Especially look risk clotting birth control medications. always accept degree risk everything Probably small number. 

I wish people this. Exaggerating side effects makes lose credibility long run. Maybe create vaccine need ASAP cause virus ravage populations. I’m qualified answer that. I’m also sure know, least haven’t reported definitively harshly punish arrest jail anyone refuses comply. Make people either comply science, fear.

Oddly enough I've seen research says opposite. Punishing people harshly lead better compliance. Taking education approach, encouraging rather forcing compliance, better results. 

This actually done NZ. almost actual enforcement lockdown measures. Police spoke people, cautioned them, sometimes gave verbal written warning. very, people even fined, let alone arrested breaking rules. 

Also NZ one countries never mask mandate, point alert level. Masks recommended inside stores Level 3 4 lockdowns, required. place legally required public transport even actually enforced. absolutely sure vaccine cause? you’re going wear mask forever then? realize covid isn’t going away probably years optimistically right? I’ll wear mask public since everyone able vaccinated yet I’m sure hell wearing mask private around also fully vaccinated friends family. risk basically zero everyone situation. Wait wear masks walking around Disney Springs? agree, I've observed people. Think there's lapse messaging throughout entire pandemic we've somehow effectively communicated purpose many things like masking even vaccinating fall category individual risk tolerance instead overall community risk. still see many people say ""well mask works well wear mine?"", somehow still failed messaging something like masks risk protecting others. think kind messaging uphill battle place like states much individualistic culture (which even worst trait, think lots benefits culture, us favors times need large scale communal response). recovered, gain sense taste smell back? tested positive vaccine (very annoyed), that’s basically symptom. even cough fever. Thanks. high risk person also can't get shot, really exciting news.

In much US UK summer saw cases drop low enough possible move zero-Covid strategy. would required closing borders implementing quarantine systems like Taiwan South Korea, people quarantined home, electronically monitored ensure compliance. 

The biggest error US UK made taking mitigation strategy, letting restrictions cases got ""low enough"" accepting continuing transmission. could prevented 2nd 3rd waves virus, killed far first wave.

We need mandated paid sick leave. That’s really downvotes come from. downvotes come people spewing misinformation vaccine doesn’t prevent getting covid, reduces mild case. **NOT** true. vaccines 90% effective *preventing* infection. Breakthrough cases mostly mild compared non-vaccinated populations. *only* reasons continue mask twofold. First, don’t want start making excuses people haven’t vaccinated. 30% population vaccinated, it’s hard police hasn’t vaccinated still needs mask. Second, immuno compromised people haven’t vaccinated enough people reach herd immunity protect people. Everyone else pretty much get vaccinated lives. *no reason* indoor unmasked social gatherings fellow vaccinated friends family members. even around unvaccinated people unmasked, small numbers. 

The downvotes come people don’t see middle ground keep acting like you’re vaccinated start acting like you’re invincible. kids desperate go back normal school. go work sick would get written calling 3 times within 6 months. Another place worked allowed 5 sick days. supposed workplace doesn’t give time off? Hopefully workplaces change let people work home sick. also hope people start wearing masks they’re sick go work.

I don’t know people would come wasn’t required…

As far concerned, risk getting employees sick much higher concern possible productivity could provide coming in. would tell employees felt good enough work home, could, also wasn’t expected. 

I’m sure employers much worse … think it’s also something ingrained American culture even employer everything right, unless sick employee literally shamed it, often come sick. now, I'll wear mask indoors public places. That's it, probably feel need anymore later year. private K-12 schools Maine sites 52 75 active outbreaks listed Maine Center Disease Control Prevention week. school-related cases represent 10 percent state’s total cases past month. one school recorded outbreak 20 cases.

But state businesses see dropping mandates sometime summer. like it’s 7.99999 billion peoples opinion authoritarianism SMART approach! don’t want you’re part problem! Wow, dumb. Similar pfizer except reaction started within 5 hrs dragged 5 days alternating mild moderate symptoms. Mostly muscle joint aches, fatigue, low grade fever (topped 101F), pretty serious diarrhea 2nd 3rd nights never hit day. Weird.

 Unfortunately got less common symptom swollen sore underarm lymph node resolving 21 days later.

Edit add: 2 weeks stamina excersize (biking/pilates) poor back normal. best chance south (Alabama, Louisiana, etc). sick leave US, really know going about. need take sick day send email superior stay home. get paid worked day.

Of course every job like this, every job like countries, too. won’t happen long paid sick leave isn’t mandatory. agree aren’t time machine need critical mass people vaccinated truly effective OPs view won’t help mildly infuriating. think we're long way happening. Maybe high majority population vaccinated low daily case count. School month. There's literally reason keep spreading COVID, knowing people lied said school safe.  90-95% efficacy means 90-95% reduction probability catching virus versus unvaccinated person. literally definition vaccine efficacy. 

I'm making numbers (the risk high, using simple numbers): 1 100 chance exposed New Mexico, 1 10 chance Michigan, means chance getting COVID unvaccinated 1% 10% respectively. vaccinated, assuming 90% efficacy, risk .1% New Mexico 1% Michigan. 10X higher exposure risk Michigan makes chance catching COVID high Michigan New Mexico without vaccine. 

There nuance extent protection vaccine *relatively* binary - either enough antibodies (exposure viral load aside). However, personally way knowing effective body creating neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, practice, whether protection binary super relevant. Trump said I'm voting comment recognized impact last year you. 

I think lot people need look symptoms PTSD assess themselves. really rough year everyone, needs transition period things go back normal. Nick Carter would say, “Everybody: Rock body.” Promise made, promise kept. healthcare workers, drug companies, pharmacies, logistics folks helped make happen. Let’s keep vaccinating! extremely less likely Canada - ok, 60 workforce eligible vaccine now. Joined fully vax club hour ago!

Second shot comes three days, see one goes soon. can't wait! pretty much lot Israelis. People waited near vaccination spots evening appointments done queued whatever left. I'm 20's health problems got second shot early February. agree see people opposed this. optional, one forcing do. certainly help flu season. Patents. Can't let pfizer make bit less money vaccine practically spent nothing even saves thousands lives response people mask vaccination;

That's fantastic, however starting ""hit wall"" say. country ""cap out"" somewhere 50-60% adults vaccinated - nearly enough herd immunity, especially since kids vaccinated.

Since government said mandate vaccination, industry businesses save us. Employers starting mandate vaccination return office. stadiums mandating want attend games. Cruise lines mandating well. kids vaccinated, bet school districts make mandatory.

I think FDA grants full authorization vaccines, instead emergency authorization, see companies mandate business liability insurance. Airlines it, certainly want travel overseas, choice get vaccinated.

In words, right people choice. forever unless want never fly work (in jobs) go school. Oy whole comment chain cringe-inducing...

Gotta love Conservative foresight infrastructure produce mRNA vaccines quantity, hopefully maintained current pandemic, great value going forward. New pathogens sequenced hours, vaccines designed days, production enough trials weeks.

Also bit groupthink.

I noticed bit switch flipped pandemic started. People resistant masks 50% people wearing suddenly saw everyone wearing time.

I imagine it'll fairly similar becoming comfortable again.

We hear jackasses, large majority people hunkering waiting everyone know get jab. new variants problematic. Britain talking need booster shot year. NYT article misleading itself. data gathered potential spread COVID variants, *prudent* take precautions asymptomatic symptomatic spread. Dr. Fauci erring side caution, good scientists do. malicious. save lives.

From *clinical* standpoint, work one small Urgent Care Florida. Every day see vaccinated individuals test positive. mild symptoms. matter fact, reason anyone vaccinated symptoms gets tested - travel. 

So: tiny Urgent Care keeps seeing positive vaccinated individuals, need take closer look see transmitting viable viral loads. catch variant, transmissible?

Right lot questions. answered suitably, continue mask up, grocery store, especially medical setting. state state, county county. 

So county, we've vaccinating everyone 16+ 5 days now.

There hoops jump through, particularly return home countries, still open. No, Fauci's problem 10 months Trump politicization masks. Freaking masks. 

Trump reason people 30% Americans want listen Fauci. Trump undermined every opportunity. glad many Americans saw idiocy still trust Fauci.

And tired people listening recommendations place. tired idiots know hell p-value act like know judge efficacy vaccine. tired going store seeing people without wearing masks. tired reminding people around wear masks. 

Every. Fucking. Day. 

Fauci doing, telling Americans keep wearing masks social distance numbers drop.

You want Fauci treat Americans like rational adults listen carefully recommendations would understand importance people fully vaccinated keep wearing masks, CDC said fully vaccinated people need wear masks (which probably don't), know bunch asshole vaccinated would wear masks claiming vaccinated. 

We drop masks social distancing get much lower number infections (and hospitilizations deaths). then, idiots fault. hope right. skeptic 2 weeks ago 60% would get vaccinated. Thankfully appears hard core anti vaxxers fewer thought... Hmmm......

Is masking social distancing bad? Genuine question.

If 10% population (kids 11 younger) still risk, thing 90% wear masks social distance (stay 6 ft away people related you), really something dont wanna 2022?

I scour scientific info vaccinations kids (i toddler) every wknds. Everything see lately points vaccines young 6months old infants early 2022, best case 2021 realistically beginning 2022.
So that’s remotely close reality, think they’re conservative estimates, we’re talking maybe 3 months masking social distancing 2022 10% population.

Is really bad? me.


Now, i’m means saying keep restaurants closed, sport events closed, outdoor concerts summer. No, i’m advocating that.
I’m advocating 90% population free whatever like, keep mask keep somewhat distant strangers vaccines open everyone including young children. comparing high risk patients vs relatively less vulnerable. hoping would extend overarching guidelines, like:

Phase 1 - countries vaccinate ederly. Export extra.

Phase 2 - age group 45 above. Export rest.

And on...

Or maybe, first focus vaccinating everyone major cities/high density areas. would effectively (in theory, least) negate major hotspots developing.

I’m offering layman’s perspective, I’m sure experts know best. mean chewing cow still alive even really eating steak? /s I'd imagine it'd still preferable since takes low temperatures store transport Moderna Pfizer ones. 100% ideal outcome vaccine blocks infection entirely.

Of course elderly, especially nursing homes, might level immune response younger people. case, given often like 10% fatality rate, asymptomatic cases huge success. Proud Mass today! difference here. random. good data lockdown effectiveness. 

Yes is. first finding literally 1 second using thing called Google. tried reading study before? study topic all? 

I'm rhetorically asking point. obviously not. told didn't. opinion based watching people lockdown CA. looking say Singapore Taiwan do.

So speculated. I’m getting mine today!! sure get arm even spike protein distribution. seemed surprised vaccine free, well informed. Yeah, I'm 3 days two weeks done (though I've read Pfizer's immunity curve based one week), pretty sure I'm fully immune point.

I'm going wild state worst infected nation (Michigan), certainly far less concerned entire pandemic, risk lower me, others around entire time, even high infection rates. key word here. really know. widespread human coronaviruses reinfect you, cause relatively mild disease (common cold), maybe end game similar Covid? Less harmful several bouts, eradicated?

Also, someone gets three Covids two years, might less vaccine hesitant get third one. saying everyone learn, deniers probably will.

Last thing - historical remark. common cold coronaviruses entered humanity long time ago. really know caused Covid-like pandemics early years, got milder. previous Covid hit sometime 1500s, another plague torment Renaissance people. got Moderna first shot whole shoulder hurt, second shot also hurt significantly less first time. 

It’s weird affects people differently.  employers certain states allowed mandate this? TX employer said able mandate vaccinations people going back office it’s personal choice. mean provide immunity, even good vaccines.

And reinfection numbers also rather low. data granular. know upticks cases associated reopening restaurants. see epidemiologists saying publicly eat indoors again, big factor decision making. yep! nationwide 16+, use term ""adult"" instead. able get moderna 18, though. can’t figure stupid... wanting vaccine spending $200 something easily faked. restrictions removed, reinstated unless there's huge number breakthroughs hospitalizations. *Maybe* impose travel restrictions to/from countries low vaccination rates. people kidding think *basically already completely open* US going lockdown Winter got shot #2 last week, next week I'm fully vaccinated. Eligible mean available today. need 200 million shots arms fully vaccinate enough population herd immunity. manufactured yet shipped various States yet. people vaccinated yet able get one week, next. still going take 2 months get shots many arms. turn 5 7 need send back, badly. got 2nd shots Friday, cases still high around us going up. trying throw fire risk long term issues. Feels like there’s right answer parents. early March... much late international travel restrictions make much difference.

That's rubbish.

And time, around July, Victoria's cases exceeded UK's per capita basis. **local transmission eliminated** - hard long lockdown implemented. places require doctors note lot. cold means two weeks full year - worst case get several colds. 15 days (3 weeks) demand doctors note obviously something wrong cold need get checked out.

Of course something see doctor get note. sore throat possibly infection, need see doctor check (or likely lab nurse), note take seconds write. They're planning ramp Manufacturing. Might want reread wording. read like opposite. yep. talked many people Chi-town area came Springfield 6 weeks ago shots fastest path full immunization everything encourage fence-sitters.  experience well. little tired day dose 2. makes feel better, care? something makes friend comfortable matter? necessary, probably not, impact you? Mine actual card stock kind card stock buy Walmart office store. could forge one 10 seconds think need special equipment so. ""Covid going kill people 2021 2020, I'm sure even going already gotten first vaccine shot United States, tempting start thinking ""almost over."" globally speaking, far over. good data lockdown effectiveness. 

My opinion based watching people lockdown CA. looking say Singapore Taiwan do. general, vaccines pretty effective variants. vaccine shown effective variant AstraZeneca vaccine B.1.351 variant, still variant seems highest degree immune escape. vaccines (Pfizer, J&amp;J, Novavax) demonstrated good, reduced, efficacy vs B.1.351. maybe people want go back socializing fun. may actually faster US slower rollout. could slower too, going fast vaccination imagine overshot break point quickly.

I thinking while.

Adults get sicker. Sicker people transmit more.

Kids transmit it, seems like much (couple studies show this). 

So half people vaccinated disproportionately good spreading virus. Transmission go half.

The questions become really intricate point.

Are remaining unvaccinated adults likely already recovered infection? likely get infected now? get infected now, likely exposure unvaccinated people? infection rate much much lower january we're almost half way January numbers. cause concern also wonder means less young people getting turned away elderly taking majority ICUs Hospital beds. Calling Fauci overly cautious ignorantly American thing I’ve read day. anyone reading evidence good faith he’s clearly moderate respect. Everyone paid salary. hourly overtime.

There‘s risk every time shove kids car drive around, too, people don’t think twice that. yet I’d speculate there’s good chance kid higher chance dying traffic accident question whether risk tolerable, that’s individual parent.

Things leave 'tolerable' standard parents: seatbelts car seats. analogy broken. Clearly big banks held responsible way behaved 2008 crash (and many things). 

A bit difference sentencing crack cocaine. 

Double standards.

That said despicable. Great! Let's get with, please!

Going get 2nd PFizer jab tomorrow. Table 16 (severe) J&amp;J FDA report shows 85%.

Table 13 (severe) Pfizer-BioNTech FDA report shows 75%

I believe 'virtually 100%' appear medical intervention probably important factor anyway. 

If read sources also see lot big differences trials overall even end point definitions. hard draw direct comparison. put another way think we're making gross simplification compare overall efficacy numbers obtained different definitions different test conditions. 

And might say day dose ranges say 100%. true also proves point reported data differently. sit slice dice data day long get different % results. 

And binary. simple either covid not. exposed not. also factor viral load much exposed to. variants exposed on. 

And point would less cases placebo also then. correct less cases Placebo group Pfizer trial well. 

Sources: 

Pfizer: next time go grocery store, notice many carts strung lot. 

There reward punishment returning it. People right thing do. 

I don’t see majority people US wearing mask they’re sick. country way selfish. look response masks said “this protect neighbors around you”. 

I’m masking surprised see people “because right thing do”. Let's assume gigantic number people get shots today.

Why earth would assume that?  jobs don’t really allow others it’s frowned upon use sick days. It’s stupid needs change.  heard somewhere State ""Europe"" US.

^^^^/S Nice know, can't trust everyone else get theirs. crazy family never taken Covid seriously, I'm hesitant let kid play kids. store, many people wear masks. Memorial Day going absolutely fucking lit.

Fuck yeah! 4th July going chain too. you’re fully vaccinated mask placebo. makes feel better that’s great it’s nothing actual risk. vaccine works. policies work far enforce tho. Got mine PA California ID insurance card. problem That's exciting also scary hell. Kids going spreading like crazy. 5 year old kindergartner going second covid test month due exposure school. wear masks, try keep distance on. people get vaccinated, we'll dropping lot things. kids still vaccinated along good chunk population decided get it. 

I though looking forward getting first shot today!  Lol point posting comments like these? many people talk *terrified* get shot people saying “I FELT LIKE DYING” (like, terrified they’re weighing whether it’s worth it). seems like way people try one-up little sleep got little studied, people love talking bad Covid shot reaction (with emphasis making sound bad possible) turn around wonder vaccine hesitancy high. individual level, matter. collectively, matter ton. think people would agree double masking **outside** completely overkill. get enough people believe necessary morally right start issue pushing asking continued mandates.

In state example, one mandated wear mask outdoors regardless ability social distance. example, walking dog forest. I'll never see soul there. go local pub drink unmasked. want people fight loosening already absurd mandate. 

We ignoring people whack risk assessment. questioning reassuring them. Preferably education scientific studies. media went *so so* hard fear angle people reluctant look new info. Article 2020 Sep 18 vaccine efficacy works. 

The vaccines protective severe disease hospitalization, 100%. Here's [some shared another post. Thank insight! honestly didn’t think fact that, yes mutated, still remains virus whole. Im sure didn’t think way. That’s serious whataboutism I’d agree want (probably) already got it, it’s important still pretty significant amount didn’t, primarily stem locations access vaccination sites, example, im located tons pharmacies even FEMA site offering appointment, however, people don’t struggling find appointments. would cool big retail pharmacies CVS, Walgreens Walmart could post daily data many appointments booked get gage many upcoming appointments it’s staying consistent, imagine even area appointment FEMA site, pharmacies still booked foil comment, side effects all! Everyone different sure, talk feeling crappy! ordered pizza, watched movies, lazy wonderful day it. Hope luxury. 1-2 weeks. Pfizer suggests 1 week, CDC says 2 catch 2-Dose. Trump's administration could've done much better terms setting better vaccine distribution system. needed single federal system, opposed 50 states implementing solution top various pharmacy chains own. issue US students. current rate vaccinations within month half two months highly likely almost everywhere US day appointments open. Biden campaign slogan something? Every time see name mentioned see it. Serious question. Lol that's virus works Like said don’t care, vaccinate undocumented workers they’re stay. We'll end 60% adults nationwide pretty easily. New York already 55% first doses still increasing steady, sustained rate. 

My guess hit brick wall around 70% adults nationwide slow increase 75%. states may end high 85% low 55-60%. States 85%+ vaccination probably see endemic spread elimination time imported cases states states 55-60% likely see consistent (but low level) spread maintained.

Very strong outreach programs ""easy access"" programs (E.g. mobile clinics showing places employment underpenetrated neighborhoods) could increase end number. americans won’t even stay home work cold.

Won’t *can’t*? Hardly anyone loves job much they’re willingly going even feel awful. Also schools employers require well. would something like Tylenol okay?

One issues starts point, well.

Essentially, feel kinda ""invincible"" get vaccine, even contract covid (a much rarer instance post vaccine course), likely serious way. Theres decent chance might even know got it, due vaccines effect immune system.

So ""invincible""? Essentially, dont mind getting cold... effectively... yeah.

But me.

I could spread immunocompromised people mentioned. someone gotten vaccinated yet.

Eventually, we'll need accept people stridently anti vax going take risk. we're point yet, purely numbers wise.

So, meantime, mask. Even *are* invincible, practically speaking. everyone else is, yet (also, ""everyone"" practical term literal one). they're going soon! Ah, you’re right. apologies. Yeah actually good thing. Still know everyone charged big mac, differently healthcare. could even argue minorities much likely uninsured, hospital pricing illegal discrimination. mean, seems unlikely based current strength vaccines variants we're seeing, always real possibility. Things get bad enough people voluntarily stay home herd immunity kicks too. That's preferred method though. agree part. Tourist coming getting vaccinated could happen. 

But undocumented workers mostly passport even that. 

An utility bill could work lot live apartment really name anything. 

Kinda tricky situation. really hope undomented workers get vaccinated soon possible.  Epic even show ID got vaccinated Walmart, I've seen lot comments saying similar things. probably come right get shot. Belgium already given 2,3M first doses. Another 3,5M people vaccinated Pfizer Moderna.

J&amp;J AZ deliver 55 70M whole EU respectively, 1,5M 2M Belgium. 2M AZ doses enough vaccinate 1M people.

2,3+3,5+1,5+1= 8,3M (75% population) end June. Without AZ J&amp;J would 6M, still around 55% total population unrealistic worst case scenario. hope plan provide distribution isn’t equal areas. Nope, that's 25% **adults**. survey children. adult get vaccine, think going get kids vaccinated? please fucking ban flights India (Canada)... That's WKDs matey, Geordie Blanket known enlightened parts. first second AstraZeneca doses formula?

Every expert said removing restrictions going heavily dependent many people gotten vaccinated local case counts/hospitalizations—which affected vaccination rate. multiple companies offering incentives employees patrons, although controversial least case vaccine passports. CDC also released relaxed guidelines people vaccinated aren’t going matter people didn’t bother following keep spreading deadly disease.

The people saying reason get vaccinated honest since public health government made clear getting vaccinated best pathway forward normal life. resistance getting vaccinated prolonging things complaining about. I’m incentivizing making easy possible people get vaccinated, messaging restrictions go away enough people vaccinated crystal clear experts government. can’t say exactly happen, depends many people get vaccinated rate community spread. 50% locals get vaccinated, it’s going take lot longer community spread die restrictions go away 90% locals get vaccinated (especially 16 can’t get vaccinated). Considering antivaxxers ability jump every single thing somehow lot people would know.

At beginning making allergic reactions front page news story important all. curious start screaming variant claiming one resists vaccine completely Youyang Gu's projections helped keep sanity last year. summer predicted Sun Belt surge would peak July 23rd, sure enough, clear indicators downward trajectory date. Haha think people understood downvotes. people saying everyone wants one get one now. - realistically still going mid July get 200 million 2nd shots. Hopefully COVID numbers smashed ground then.

Luckily, case seems mild. It’s frustrating one want safe, two, want able hangout without worrying possibly Covid giving one year old son. Like, we’re close done pandemic, they’re helping drag out. January peak 1,404 deaths 19th. yes essentially 99%+ reduction 3 months. going go 20% population 70% population two months? Seriously? That's 250 million people vaccinated two months. 

I find hard believe, would require vaccinating much faster USA currently vaccinating. signs EU type logistical capacity. Agree 100% try get trials done children quickly possible (Pfizer already done thankfully 12-15 pending approval), 1% kids definitely get hospitalized COVID. 

COVID hospitalization (and death) children exceptionally rare. bad flu year worse health children COVID, especially young children 12. 

In stats see hospitalization rates children use confirmed COVID cases going massively inflated children mild symptoms asymptomatic consequence testing rates kids low. 

The sooner vaccines approved 12-15 even younger, quicker reach herd immunity. think 12-15 year olds alone combined good uptake adult population probably reach herd immunity without 12s (which great). vaccine hesitancy remains high adults, we'll likely need 12s get there. Um pay 7.8% population one dose, make sense completely open floodgates adults? assume lot vulnerable 50+ 65+ people opportunity get vaccinated yet, going even harder them.

This seems like purely political move buy support advance coming lockdown rather rational public health decision. forms motivated common sense legislation matter public health. Ex: seatbelt,car seat, brake light laws. specifically not, rural Appalachian community rural Texas ranch community Need data change hospitalization figures age group compared infection rates make claim, ask doctors seeing “more”.

They’re trying avoid many people possible avoid serious disease death. sorry hear means wait extra weeks hit bar. completely understand caution hesitant messaging CDC, correct here. probably go hang bunch high risk people without masks, time get second shot, high level immunity, enough keep people pretty safe. OK man. Ignore experts, take mask want long good. Someone like interest anything interests anyway. folks like you, thing got much worse to. take counter fever reducer feel need it. Stay hydrated too. Ah HAH! great observation. interest certain parties Americans suddenly cast cloaks, speak, start mass-consuming again, it?! was.

You're going get first appointment usually. People physically go vaccinate many can. Go them. can't guarantee ever see again.

Personally opposite me, I'll avoid stores, Boomers gonna Boom. Still really accurate though. We’ve long lockdown hasn’t strict quite restrictions lifted Steve said. day got bad. little dizzy, able drive fine.

The next day worst, peaked day 3 feeling much better day 4 practically baseline. don’t care allowed get vaccinated, point they’re checking ID’s want get you’re another country it’s hard. 1 death england yesterday, no. Two things:

1) Youyang Gu's forecast crazy accurate far: Officially 100 NYers I've registered vaccine appointments! Feels cool say part helping over. got COVID vaccine shot yesterday, I'm feeling fever. take medicine alleviate fever? Covid months ago. look research T-Cell immunity? explore vaccine naturally immune? admit taking meds arthritus ruined immune system years. Ive long time havent gotten sick aside allergies long time.

Believe Ive never gotten hangover. don’t drink much even times never effects. holding shots back

In community, seem lot empty spots idle healthcare workers. open everyone 16 almost month now.

Some places less interested getting fully vaccinated. That's awesome news! got vaccinated weeks back hopefully get see cousins later summer (they list well). 

Still waiting things get better internationally; seems like able get back Australia time soon taken toll me, need take one day time guess. We're better place 2020 least. Maxed out??? Maxed means we’re longer vaccinating. That’s case. all. one person gets vaccinated, given dozens saw kroger TODAY getting theirs, that’s pretty likely, haven’t “maxed out” [Mississippi Struggling Fill Vaccine Appointments ) Yeah, Canada gets bad rap comparison withe UK US. worldwide scale, even scale vs developed countries, fine. Yep will. it’s OK kids I’ll get time son hopefully. Mom got one-shot I’m mostly introvert feel like people go first still.

Since start pandemic, 246 Americans age 17 died COVID. 
 
In 2019, 844 Americans age **13** died car crashes. 
 
Sorry neither time frame age range match up, numbers could find, considering scope wider ways COVID motor vehicles crashes yet crash deaths still 243% higher, think point stands. lot states better paid sick leave California.

We're going need mandates. similar EMA's rolling review process misunderstanding it? Healthcare surges danger anymore. Michigan danger overwhelming hospitals, despite recent surge.

As ""society whole"" piece, imposing ascribing risk tolerances preferences everyone else. everyone believes lockdowns necessary preferable.

And, point, despite people said Michigan beat surge without lockdown, are. would nice people would admit wrong once. 90% sure U.S executive branch one makes possible. Hence Joey getting credit it. vaccines target spike - immune response targeting RBD spike. absolutely evade vaccines simultaneously. nothing like HIV drugs target multiple proteins multiple spots makes unlikely evolve mutations proteins simultaneously. fundamentally misunderstood ""work different ways"" vaccines means.

You selective pressure virus vaccinated people exist unvaccinated. vaccinated virion progeny best suited survival evade antibodies cells person vaccine. Every infected vaccinated person chance rare mutation develop. They're likely infected unvaccinated person.

I assure likely mutant would out-pace ability vaccinate. Yes, things insanely fast now. near fast virus spread.

The hope escape mutants possible RBD change much can't bind ACE2. fear though several mutations change binding receptor(s) targeted could arrise. still believe we're likely going need boosters variants end virus - stagnate 50% vaccinated something like selective pressure concerns me.

It's hard give exact date. Despite vaccination efforts going swimmingly US, cases still risen 30% people become increasingly confident gathering despite 40% vaccinated. US needs 75% entire populace vaccinated herd immunity, including children. Fauci starts giving timelines people start planning around them, timelines happen accurate, people going start pointing fingers calling head.

Meanwhile, old people motivation ""I want die"" (pretty much single strongest motivation is) pretty easily override political affiliation might have.

Also probably worth pointing conservatives united all. really Fox News running anti-vax segments, meanwhile every conservative politician/leader vaccinated Donald Trump stated directly, publicly, repeatedly everyone get vaccine. there's lot breathing room even pretty staunch conservative get shot without feeling bad it. state people know apply getting vaccines red areas cause know they'll instantly get vaccine cause one wants vaccines there...

There three options law:

2) go regular OSHA rulemaking required law keep mask mandate longer. 
3) state official break law unilaterally extend emergency powers keeping mandate (and certainly lose court battle process).

Wow difficult. Fauci would give estimate instead fucking around time, hard position.

There's way anyone half brain would give time estimate. might convince give estimate based spread number cases, never, ever time. Ok well soon everyone 18 plus chance receive vaccine. won’t worry anymore. Honestly think neccasery masks filters that's theory  Fauci already dead Huh? They’re lockdown we’re lockdown???? mean, people say won’t get it, go get it. Especially pass 50% Lie. people, one third nation vaccinated! reaction first shot? super warm, dizzy, nauseous, whole body felt like fire first shot. I’m really nervous second one, especially work wouldn’t give time off. Got second dose last thursday! love throw “most hypochondriacs” like it’s based reality. public health officials doctors hypochondriacs want everybody else lockdown never go out? You’re absolutely delusional. Still addressing point dangerous things ignored. Why? 

From article:

The Chinese CDC head said *""don't high rates protection"".* 

A 67% result really contradict statement. I'd say decent ""very high"". Good see BBC totally misrepresent comments saying admitted low effectiveness something. *Cough AP News* yet, JT still won’t let us in. 
While Florida beaches full Canadian tourists flew there. 

It’s surreal. 😎 stopping spread. It’s mitigation techniques reduce it. hospitalizations initially somehow warped people thinking zero covid possibility It’s much personal thing, it’s Chinese soft power ploy.

- woke day (12 hour mark) chills, fever 100.6, weak, awful headache

- fever got 102.6 like 18 hour mark, took Tylenol 20 hour mark. Headache chills stayed day. Slept day.

Safe say excited dose two Infrequent allergic reactions 100% expected monitor dose  That’s bridging study does, smaller study demonstrate antibody production previously vaccinated participants. problem vector immunity bridging study absolutely show lack antibody production.

You don’t need full ph3 modified booster vectored not. Personally think it’s variant CA experienced winter moving East. worst then. Good idea! Booster someone else broader coverage might actually make sense. it’s apples apples. also used different criteria different end point goals. Also diversity clinical trial participants.

1. Based data Israel, expect cases drop low early June, especially areas high vaccines uptake (obviously).

2. J&amp;J trial data, protection still rising 56 days post-vaccination. think CDC says you’re fully-protected 2 weeks J&amp;J vaccine, you’re really trying safe, ought give vaccine 6-8 weeks take effect. think immune response vaccine, people stronger immune systems actually feel worse body responding shot aggressively someone older weaker immune system.

Dont want happen bad variant. politicized safety. live damaged mental state Less deadly everything do? Less deadly driving? like virus, neat. Yep! first though. felt pretty crappy. But, nearly crappy would ventilated.. still creeping categories pace 0.3% per day. would expect something like 85% seniors eventually get it. People love letting anxiety override minds situations. I’m like “don’t worry you’re likely die way die this” hear disagreeing people (and myself...) get exercise (in general terms).

it probably wonders overall health helps keep us mobile age subsequently stave issues well. Also good mental health adn knows else.

I mostly mostly hating bad science journalism interesting subject try explain driving around causation.

It reads like another wine study - COVID edition. willing also positive correlation COVID survivability Bordeaux consumption, people afford Bordeaux afford proper health care people look get ill. would nothing wine per say.

The Spanish flu good example disease killed healthy young people. Health necessarily dictate survivability generally correlation cases.

And maybe good COVID say based anything read article. opinion reasoning brought low vague comments cancer also made (part called out). really get pet fixed. would Bob Barker think?

Sorry I'm leaving like optimistic way viewing compared me! right, 12% global population bad considering nobody planet heard COVID ~16 months ago. *""The state reporting average 1,661 new cases day, 18 percent past two weeks, according New York Times database. Hospitalizations climbed 19 percent time period. Deaths virus, tend lag behind infections several weeks, slightly increased.""* response coronavirus* employer weekly saliva tests we've told go foreseeable future. takes 2 weeks build immunity we’re mostly getting groups responsible hospitalizations deaths spread.

It seems likely Memorial Day states hit whatever final peak might take 4-6 weeks steady decline.

That estimate based we’ll hit 50% total population (not adult) 70% adult first dose, well assuming near date Pfizer gets approved 12-16 Novovax permanently ending supply constraints. isn’t that’s completely false. Nope. wrong. Here’s actual doctor: think point fair call someone ""braindead"" taking medical advice doctor. 100% this!!!!!!!!

Plenty empty hotels U.S. right now. Fly over, get vaccinated soon land. Spend three weeks U.S. Get second shot heading out.

Or get J&amp;J spend two weeks head back. Sorry maybe better grieve people die? Sounds harsh extreme foolishness come price. Extremely sorry someone family like that. understand painful must watch someone kill like that. can't people full vaccine walk around without mask like school something? amazing last commenter told actually wait 56 days JNJ full effect that’s probably guy ventilator so, yeah, let’s wait data 🤣 would imagine many people might stop 1 shot. even 1 shot 50 days much better shot all. want take opportunity point Canada sucks. specific instances little suspect. India seems high case number low death count comparatively According wife (who China) said reported almost certainly get trouble (he’s already kind especially respected Party tool anyway).  reaction first shot? 

Absolutely 0 reaction 1st shot except sore arm. 

I heard folks much milder reactions 2nd shot compared mine, never know. hope intense mine, considering work situation. Yeah think 55-60% generous. 

I actually think good 10-15% take eventually (like end year). know multiple people got virus January February told drs wait least 8-12 weeks get theirs. people getting it, I'm seeing people posting months ago ""not getting vaccine until"" taking it. second point, would significant chronic immunosuppression, like HIV? it’s stupid obvious can’t say metrics mind lifting restrictions increasing 1.7% tomorrow! WINDMILL ARM SHOT WONT REGRET nice hear fellow Canadian actually positive it

On Reddit there's bizarre relentless negative vibe every weeks we're getting news deliveries exceeded targets moved forward—we went everyone 18 getting dose end year everyone 16 end September, start September, time summer, time June, enough doses coming everyone's second dose start July (50M 2-dose vaccines, 300K J&amp;J end April larger orders coming within quarter, plus we'll start getting US shipments June—if end May) OP, first Pfizer gave sore arm days U.S. may restart J&amp;J vaccines Friday.

Personally hope see busloads Canadians wearing N95 masks, face shields gloves coming get vaccinated. Hell, better yet, require anyone crossing U.S. land border vaccinated vaccinate spot can't show proof vaccination.

Vaccinate, baby! Vaccinate! real reason wearing mask helps normalize wearing mask. lot fully vaccinated people stopped wearing masks, unvaccinated people would see stop wearing masks too, even though everyone wants vaccine chance get one yet. unvaccinated, maskless people (who blend maskless, vaccinated people) would infect masked unvaccinated people waiting turn. everyone chance get vaccine masks come off, then, risk losing control thing close finish line. Isn’t massive generalisation? literally said article, ""Gao Fu, head Chinese Centres Disease Control Prevention, Saturday said conference current vaccines ""don't high rates protection""."" strategy worked perfectly me. Got shot first day available age group, drive ~1hr red area state. skimmed scientific articles suggesting people previous viral exposure stronger vaccine reactions. Needs research correlation. Well get them, you’ll invincible India lot cases low death rate got sicker vaccine ever flu. Still worth spread covid though. kicked mine too. Sickest I’ve ever felt guess feel lucky able say that.  I'd rather ability leave country get back expedite vaccines told might take two years get vaccinated sit imprisoned island unable see family. According China’s CDC effective vaccine. conclusion backed data released Brazil. Nobody really cares, man odds struck lightning higher Yeah schools employers mandate insurance definitely charging don’t get vaccine like smoking. 

Once FDA approved probably hear certain companies requiring it. 2 weeks final shot India neighbour gave doses benevolent fashion vaccine powerhouse neighbour Getting second jab soon. I’m gonna surprise mom right Mother’s Day. :D might looked like ground, appreciate first hand info, looking solely data deaths due COVID, looks like response second wave effective. think misleading, whole go stuff like polio vaccine. found reminding helped bunch convincing people get one.

Clearly infected coronavirus. Ah, appeal tradition we’ve handling flu wrong, mask mandates last 100 years? society locked every flu season prevent spread?

Using logic. Women would never gotten right vote, gay people allowed get married, weed would illegal. guesses:

-	very elderly, like 90+ years old
-	immunocompromised, immunesystem properly working building antibodies sufficiently
-	some kind allergic reactions covid balance.

I certainly still avoiding certain indoor situations like dining case rates get city/state.

Personally I’ve seen lot anti AZ posts purely basis what’s news journals it, I’m sure know reputation put wringer lately. Whether means much not, get pretty much perfect types vaccines  vaccinated different. vaccinated 50, people 50 also going force. 

Also, huge chunk 50 percent got first dose last 2 weeks. Plus COVID cases diagnosed 4-10 days infection. kind work backwards see long wait see impact vaccinations statistics: first dose today 80 percent protection 2 weeks prevention case 3 weeks prevention hospitalization 4-5 weeks death 8 weeks.

Also remember R0 measure spread. infection rate low, rises some, R0 still greater 1. let fend then, right? right, makes telling “fully vaccinated people” masks required complicated. constitutes fully vaccinated? get old healthy. Covid kill regardless age. It’s US Census number 16-18 year olds don’t actually know precisely many are. literally said though, it? said Chinese translated interpreter.

The statement seems objectively false, though. Coronavac may worst vaccine still 100% protective trials, real world data far less backs up. Yeah. dads business like 13/50 people said wouldn’t get it. far four people gotten least one shot lol. Israel cares restrictions enforcing them, though.

America practically restrictions point many states. get it??? infected blood clots taking vaccine? Unless course you’re Palestinian living occupied territories. Let’s stop congratulating Israel “amazing” job they’ve done start recognizing much work do. 4 months ago first person get COVID shot approval done 3 days before.

I knew one even though multiple family members work ERs ICU. brother called saying he'd one day later anticipated Christmas getting vaccines hospital needed go ahead get shot. 

Now? whole church except kids 1 27 year old COVID late February advised get another weeks 10+ days past 2nd one.

My office staff vaccinated, albeit 7 us.  teachers daycare workers county (well ones got it) week past 2nd.

My grandparents, aunts &amp; uncles, even cousins least 1 shot. excellent hygiene practice good mannered significantly decrease getting anyone else sick, covid going forward slow spread flu etc...

Now give reason wear mask public inconvenience selfish. Would love sources “almost 100% safe” tell want life back normal faster need vaccinate. stoners seem whole side effect thing figured out. know single one reported adverse reactions, including 64 year old partner Covid fought double-pneumonia 5 months. sailed shots without complaints all, even sore arm. lol think yet they? source? think it’s much likely want older it’s much death sentence. trouble getting young people vaccinated think catching coronavirus big deal. That’s great attitude think premium. lucky bet specific company plus agreement give access medical records effect vaccine. Thank you! Sinovac ineffective, it’s decent. level Pfizer/Moderna/Novavax they’re aiming for. Haha salty. vaccines work getting covid walking around outside impossible anyway, there’s point wearing mask times. 

It’s basically like someone wearing helmet walking around case something falls head. “Very unlikely impossible!”

Well ok I’m still gonna chuckle wearing helmet around covid way worse either moderna shot me, though second shot feel like mild version bout covid.  got mine today too! weren’t even registered morning super exciting! look data mask wearing direct effect cases deaths, sporting events resulted spikes, protests resulted spikes. areas low mask compliance avoided major spikes vise versa.

Once VRBPAC votes approve it, 24-48 hours approval formalized FDA, based went earlier EUAs.

Very dumb iirc, millions J&amp;J doses FDA checking sure ruined not. news those? dying. same. idea why, you?  They'll comb earth one person degree absolute worst case, scariest things share. epidemiologists agree, easy find outlier get views.

I think Fauci particularly good messenger. Although times administrations suppressed saying good bad news advice would misapplied. 

Fauci absolutely knows masking vaccinated help enough make worth it. says that, people listen half message vaccinate wear masks pandemic minds.

It beginning chose emphasize mask wear run hospitals able get PPE. Fauci knew masks helped said helped.

In cases, they're probably right. person smart, people dumb. stop getting spreading it, completely. reason masks still recommended restrictions place many states spread still high many states vaccination rates reached tipping point. 

In 1-2 months - *assuming* people get vaccinated - guidance change completely everything open. case loads still high make formal recommendation. ""I'm good driver. need wear seatbelt, crash!"" curve finally flattened. want correct one thing: Lancet published peer reviewed study showed 91% Russian-only study 3.8 million showed 97%. 

However, issue self-reported data remains same. 

If me, would take Sputnik. took J&amp;J, risk side effects. helping decide someone else know that’s lot tougher.

Good luck decision thank getting vaccinated getting family vaccinated. Puerto Rico territory.  Good know! honest, started easing pre-cautions couple weeks first dose.

I'm sure it'll make difference point whether I'm full efficacy not, know I've already achieved pretty high level immunity COVID cases also going lower lower. Still good know, though! Florida still can't get vaccine resident excludes lot seasonal residents migrant workers. problem is, I’ve said beginning, medical professionals try tell us completely eliminate risk. never take advice otherwise wouldn’t fast food restaurant every corner every citizen would get good 30 minutes exercise every day.

What need politicians take advice make reasonable decisions based upon science minimize, eliminate, risk. think much people think COOL come work sick. able perform job, sick not, I'm going work. point staying home feel good make money feeling good. save sick days want something outside work still get paid. Thanks kind thoughtful words. I'm sure know much, much real intellectual topic.

(Although Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation they’re also funding CureVac probably ones, too. good work.) Well, seatbelts decades data suggesting value months w/ along w/ many factors make viable comparison IMO. understanding bureaucracy/red tape rushed, testing. case? I’d go far say you’re lucky lol. Congrats! full efficiency 7 days according Pfizer, Isreal, Australia.

We planning offer anyone vaccine october...  Exactly, problem? Yes, 50% society sociopathic. totally makes sense. think read DSM-V. I’ll bet asked psychiatrist Harvard would tell Republicans sadistic sociopaths. need put thought that. I’m going stop right there.
The thing is, reason developing booster shots probably make yearly want make sure vaccine stays effective variants. vaccines right already effective variants likely new variant. Plus new vaccines made tested time.
Look, know won’t globally quite while, places it’s starting be(like Israel) people get vaccinated less less opportunities virus mutate(and animals vaccined well) Vaccines END GOAL. always been. ain’t delusional hopium vaccines, real proof vaccines end pandemics validated tons research studies. know much miracle MRNA vaccines are?

The nightmare isn’t yet, way already. Anecdotally, lot people remember polio vaccine well. seniors know got it, received sugar cube, fairly minor memory. it’s not, can’t compare results trials done different phases pandemic, Pfizer Moderna summer cases low, J&amp;J fall peak; J&amp;J also done diverse group spread US, South America Africa, Pfizer Moderna predominantly US trial criteria different skews results make J&amp;J look effective.

As widespread use vaccine begins inhibit spread cornerstone future EUAs approvals. “Because work wouldn’t give time off.” commonplace U.S. Shameful Yeah tb would isolated sure Scheduled first poke Friday. Godspeed America. Yeah 18-29 age group became eligible weeks ago, state different dates, made **all individuals 16** able get vaccine once.

So 18-29 age group lower numbers people vaccinated adults became eligible day problem availability? maybe age group feels indifferent towards everyone else.

OK, real data. Let's look it. first set Lancet use standard does/standard dose numbers. choose rather combined set numbers show 70.4%? Bias? desire prove point? sure next use US trials summary, specific breakdown article Lancet assume single number give aggregate? mean, would make sense, yes? 76% comparable 70.4% Lancet, lowest number provided. makes pretty close, fair data. last one... look vaccine fares specifically South African variant. that's comparisons, it? 

To eye data (ignoring sample size seems pretty small part) looks like reasonably consistent set results 70-76% vaccine effective South African variant. unreasonable conclusion? Now, Sinovac compare? hard get accurate data. [This article also highlights lack data issue.

No agenda part. want truthful accurate information. issue Brazil whether ""the truth"". wildly different numbers... numbers wildly different. ""misrepresent"" Chinese CDC claim (and general cannot trust Chinese government anything political substance, simply fact gets repeatedly hammered home anytime something happens might viewed negatively concerns China). moved point brought up, results huge range. range much larger anything seen vaccines, demonstrated using data.

"" know yet whether prevents getting infected symptoms...but virus nasopharynx could infect unvaccinated person might vulnerable, inadvertently innocently get sick, "" - Fauci

So far, Fauci, benefits stated, deaths hospitalizations, said ""May"" help prevent spread.  kinda suck wear glasses. none gimmicks really work. Otherwise, care much. wear one public pretty religiously. Maybe marketing... ""The higher number goes, sooner things relax"" such. pointing ""fully vaccinated"" 2 weeks percentage. makes sense. Thank you! think we’ll reach herd immunity, mostly vaccination also natural infection. However, form virus likely become endemic. won’t likely ever eradicated. hope best there, think need plan future form COVID like flu. seems already booster shots.

So brings interesting question: “negligible” spread disease never go away? don’t think we’re yet, also don’t think it’s zero COVID. It’s vague words like “negligible” make people loose patience restrictions it’s concrete goalpost like certain vaccination % certain hospitalization metric. It’s one words throw around keep restrictions forever. Even talk cases “negligible,” say “probably” drop restrictions. push full normalcy comes from, many cases. don’t want go nightclub—it wasn’t thing COVID, either—but looking future kind activity restricted indefinitely.

As far kids, don’t think factored calculus considering flu dangerous them. main concern kids they’d spread vulnerable people. willing adults vaccinated, that’s non-issue. People can’t get vaccinated another issue. expect society permanently give nightlife people, expect take extra caution hope best? People seem think different shots, second effective. understand split dosing thing. also believe even vaccine, shots water, sooner get ""second"" documented dose ""water shot"", sooner pretend vaccinated go back normal lives.  Oh get it, don’t get sick one close life shit attitude. can’t believe someone tried flex immune system online. 

But know sounds like need win right take buddy. Maybe could say percentage then? model stuff like time, need x number shots, currently averaging 3.2 million shots day, pace we’ll reach 75% whatever day. think know people choose.

That's rational response employer reducing compensation. I’ve told (though haven’t seen officially stated mfrs reg agency) tested, would expect guidance come along recommendation get them. would imagine mix match, I’m sure we’ll see sure start it. I’ve even seen discussion mixing matching could result better immune response! Politicians handled messaging, still politics. 

If someone said wear mask instead inject bleach there'd lot less people using politics excuse. strong response first shot, body probably already exposed COVID somehow.

If body strong response second shot, body probably already exposed COVID. keep mind, whether reach herd immunity not, states economies going reopen full capacity. Even cautious liberal California they're dead set lifting occupancy limits distancing measures venues June 15th (masking mandates still effect). hard truth summer public health transition Private health, meaning want catch covid going take precautions state step help curb spread unless hospitals start getting overwhelmed. majority doses probably exist already. takes quite time vaccine manufactured time get someone's arms.

I didn’t even mention beliefs were, though, it’s kind strange say that. think reason decline simply lot people exposed, people get least immunity exposed. Every virus must fizzle point enough people get can't transmitted easily all.

I also think covid may seasonal, ample evidence coronaviruses seasonal, may seen last summer spreading rapidly many areas. possible lot spread also seasonal. year far people exposed areas vaccinated, may see seasonal trend much clearly. Meanwhile, many people South Africa die covid *each day* would die blood clots entire population vaccinated J&amp;J, even pessimistic rates. anyone know temporarily (2 years) living another state work still get vaccine state id? need wait till go home? boss absolutely can’t find got vaccine without telling them. get say hasn’t yet wants. ad hominem?

What disproven?

Don’t worry though, I’m done wasting time claim you’ve want, even you’ve done claim I’m pro lockdown repeatedly that’s either correct argument. fair point, think money may talk way. state board saying they’ll pull funding that, there’s nothing realistically do. explain risk people don’t care that. forced in-person classes available clearly wrong move. different techniques, induce body make spike protein. Still explain spiking flu spikes start january happen see anything trials younger? also see climate clearly plays large roll spread virus. Notice despite north restrictions, stricter mask mandates, much higher vaccine rates compared south, north experiencing surge covid cases, South fantastic. Israel much hotter climate. assume see cases drop like Israel northern part US warms up. vast majority Americans fully vaccinated. easy metric ending mask-wearing would least 50% majority Americans fully vaccinated. also plain see wearing mask way identity people wearing one. Thanks! “Or kids would dying like crazy lol“

I’m moving across country Sunday, can’t start shots case would get bad reaction. I’m planning getting J&amp;J anyway, permanent disability prefer jump new technology (like mRNA). 

My doctors agree that’s best, I’m obviously going new GP new specialists, I’m probably going get opinion getting (and might need help finding location J&amp;J. I’m sure). course makes difference. creates even resentment towards voted ex-President. work hospital covid unit. would guess 25% clinical staff likely get it.

Constantly working, can’t get time off, weekend course appointments booked continuously. knows she’ll side-effects even could get time would need Friday. wait weeks slots open up. double dose vaccine too... think going come money. requiring vaccine even fully approved puts universities significant financial liability. outbreak results shutdowns, going lose millions dollars, 95 percent universities fully open without financial liabilities. 

Money trumps everything, even politics, doubt political still loosing money looking foolish national level boot. Back college, classes separate building main campus. entire time college one single class main campus moved dorms.

I missed nearly every class parking completely worth it. I'm lucky attendance mandatory test days pretty easy class. end semester test days literally days I'd bother fighting parking actually show lol whole argument UK long strict lockdown last weeks 'very strict'?

I guess July claim UK restrictions last weeks restrictions.

Have good day! Well, wanting see can't push diseases brink eradication *that* insane. know scientists say though. Cool! like analogy first shot body like, oh hi, new foreign whatever. Immune response localized arm.

The second shot body seeing spike protein oh shit moment. 

The second shot occurs body recognizes foreign spike protein develops stronger immune response it. normally would say except kids going shoved classrooms full kids literally cannot get vaccinated yet. infect teachers/parents anymore, still infect themselves. 

However, realize COVID affect kids badly might still big cause concern. Richer countries access vaccine would pass vaccines poorer countries vaccine hesitancy already high would fuel idea 2 tier world, many poorer countries would refuse vaccine allowed richer countries even though risk benefit clearly favour taking vaccine. 

This exactly really think ok countries put vaccines perfectly safe use caveats ""just safe side"", wait Pfizer/Moderna doses instead. going destroy AZ/J&amp;J doses (outrageous), dump poor countries good enough supposedly safer vaccine (also outrageous)?

If vaccines dangerous, really good enough vaccinate rich countries, production cease immediately remaining doses destroyed. anyone even contemplate course action? ... Unless, course, authorities know vaccines safe enough struggling admit it. seems like pipe dream UK. feel like form pseudo lockdown ban fun long time come Check online expect. think like 8hrs scientist honestly vaccines seem relatively straightforward me. get injected something makes body produce proteins turn immune system learns fight off, way fights actual viruses things. trained, immune system recognizes threat probably many years much safer threat.

My interpretation weird dangerous (and rare) side effects stem immune system going overdrive short time responds threat. something would exposed actual virus. vaccines stimulate immune system different ways (slightly different proteins) effect less different people. virus cause blood clots, guessing much way, puts immune system overdrive. body stress infection severe (but rare) side effects like blood clots. actually far likely get blood clots virus, get it, vaccine.

Even though mRNA vaccines new technology, new way delivering thing generating response. fact far statistically mRNA vaccines safer adenovirus vector vaccines like AZ J&amp;J, perhaps target different proteins easily (or perhaps chance). vaccine drug, linger system years, triggers immune system gone.

This probably oversimplification hesitate take vaccine. probably taken 10-15 vaccines life risk/reward clearly favor reward.

We unlikely risks day day life, like flying airplane statistically increases chance blood clots, fly anyway risk small. moment time, statistically 1 400,000 chance dying particular day, obsess it. ""fearful"" chance spreading further, even vaccine prevents personally serious damage.

Getting second shot week. mind wearing mask month two I'm ""done"" cases continue go confirm good news we're expecting see.

Why spread (a version made past vaccine, less) we're close finish line? takes wear thing little longer? Sure, problem.

I get people burned masks, I'm like... post burned out. Maybe certain kind personality type something, bother anymore.  think he's done worse provincial governments. government needed bolster medical capacity let first wave rip harder avoid problem, new restrictions point extremely unpopular there's way reduce strain medical system without new restrictions feds get enough vaccine. “What you’re fully vaccinated: 

Visit inside home private setting without mask fully vaccinated people age”

“Visit inside home private setting without mask one household unvaccinated people risk severe illness”

Literally direct quote CDC guidelines. attend 100 person event without mask, everyone either vaccinated high risk, breaking guidelines. Sounds crazy, nope. It’s vaccines work. got first dose 30 min ago. started getting light headache i'm pretty sure before, practically nothing. see next hours. Got 2nd dose yesterday glad vaccinated. Yes that’s function. Specifically it’s called translation definitely seems like ""something"" happened past weeks make explode, since well without strict lockdowns several months.

If variant, hearing soon, India can't genetic sequencing rate UK, I'm sure least sequence thousand samples every week, would need see pattern emerge.

It may people ""behaving well"" even absence lockdowns, weren't, explosion cases might primarily due increased social mixing rather new variant. Covid classified flu virus? who? influenza virus. coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. 

Covid vaccines mandatory either. getting good way protect others. flu kills thousands every year. immune system might fight mean get flu shot. freedom choose, also freedom try convince think right choice is. 

Immune systems thing. immune system (likely) buoyed several vaccines helping avoid infected spreading several diseases, like measles, tetanus, whooping cough. getting sick first place huge benefit, passing disease onto others cannot vaccinated extremely important. people around depending help keep healthy. 

Lastly, simply surviving goal. flu 11 years ago recovered, developed chronic illness affects daily life. Covid seems cause similar response people (post covid syndrome). flu shot could saved much pain struggle, mention ongoing medical bills. covid shot could others. sincerely hope reconsider. Damn thought US best vaccination rates. UK even better? someone provide comparison? Fauci leader well made divisive statement. Even people leaders divisive. Current estimates 60-90% total population.

There 0% chance ever hit 90% Americans vaccinated. Even 80% highly unlikely.

Your point, even mild cases among low zero-risk populations dangerous potential new variants, implies advocating zero covid policies. correct? Divisive means creates disagreement tension, apply already came enough reason hate current administration. comments make difference. hate guess. understand importance masking public transit (and indoors) people wear masks walking around outdoors parks sidewalk? actually enforced people stop it?  really want empty moderna/pfizer/j&amp;j/AZ vials keep collectibles idea would go getting them. I've seen empty boxes ebay vials. I'm guessing distribution sites destroy vials people cant keep sell fake vaccines something I've got idea look. person like saying word ""science"" insulting sciences. No, I'm implying FAR data seatbelts Covid vaccines w/ mRNA technology new. Like said though ""several months"" might enough people. b/c good enough mean everyone else. got first one 30 min ago. feel stress level dropping. So, known human error issue Pfizer, manually diluted, I'm thinking need start making vials comically large odd-shaped ensure techs know they'll pulling right one. Whatever happened ""AstraZeneca vaccine good enough. almost useless SA variant"". proves beyond doubt vaccine better vaccine. vaccine politics. envy guys. done well. dont speak fash Pfizer doesn’t pfuck around either. slept solid 18 hours dose 2 I’m still bit fatigued feverish (got Saturday) NY cases so....low?? honestly believed pandemic would collapse civilization instead temporary public health crisis, going back normal means admitting wrong many things humans hate admitting they're wrong.

People start snap summer see friends neighbors enjoying perks normal life decide want too, rather continuing masturbate post-apocalyptic fantasy.  think mask looks cool, tbh. I'm keeping  Going grandmas isn’t going 100 peoples houses week. can't believe royally china screwed this, knew new Coronavirus December 26, 2019 based genetic sequencing, let know January 9th new coronavirus tell Human human transmission possible January 14th. pulled thing original Sars outbreak 2003. got mine January thank you! Healthcare worker haha. boyfriend works like 70 hour work weeks understand wanting easy. Honestly signed he'd probably get it. Maybe I'll that.  quite.

Nice deflection btw- ad hominem attacks arguments disproven.

You're half smart think are, interesting talk lol It’s called “leadership”. Here’s real leaders past: George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, FDR. leaders used inherent powers pursue worthy goals. 

No one even remembers VP’s presidents. Well, almost one. 

A president given enormous persuasion populace whether want admit not. persuasion used good ill. Yes society silly. know, neighbors, family, friends. Whatever happened ""AstraZeneca vaccine good enough. almost useless SA variant"". proves beyond doubt vaccine better vaccine. vaccine politics. CDC data says risk contracting covid less .007% absolutely ridiculous

wtf cdc says wear mask keep distancing too, quit bullshit recommends get COVID-19 vaccine soon one available you. However, people still get sick possibly spread COVID-19 others fully vaccinated, CDC recommends people continue take everyday actions protect others, like wearing mask, maintaining appropriate distance others, avoiding crowds poorly ventilated spaces, washing hands 0.007% chance? That’s statistics work all. Remember extreme assumptions. 

Otherwise could open field lightning storm saying hey we’re fine chances stuck lightning 1 15,000. 

Read psychology Simpson’s paradox..

Conveniently Can’t find statistic anywhere... England getting vaccinated reasons? scientist, look evidence related current vaccinations, give billions doses to, people around world. Childhood vaccinations, annual vaccinations, boosters, etc — aren’t serious side effects outweigh benefit vaccination. one effect could occur years decades later. you’re nervous mRNA, believe isn’t exactly new since mRNA technology used decade developing rabies shot... can’t mRNA whatever reason, take adenovirus vector. 

You’re high risk category based age alone — risks covid outweigh risks vaccination. It’s prudent consider everyone eventually attain immunity either via infection vaccination, either get vaccinated risk natural infection novel virus know little about. able go gym get work atall 6 months, felt like eternity me. literally said vaccinated people go see vaccinated people without wearing mask No, can't mainly really can't compare type vaccine intents purposes genetic vaccine, requiring cellular machinery transcribe RNA produce protein intracellularly. FDA vaccine exists like this. others typically purified protein, subunit protein, attenuated live viral (flu), virus like particles (looks like actual virus, genetic material, e.g. gardasil). Almost organized religions endorse vaccination - Roman Catholics, organized Protestant denominations, Orthodox Jewish rabbis, Muslim imams, lot others. Pretty much exception ""Christian Science,"" small sect says sickness illusion.

I think problem's *un*-organized religion. saw news earlier week UN trying antecipate 8 million doses month Brazil via COVAX.

Terrible name results speak themselves. vaccinate us citizens. rest world eventually benefit this.  Thanks detailed account what’s going on. seems Disney trying find perfect balance safety keeping things open, sounds like it’ll tough people vaccinated. That’s looking autumn go there, wondering might wait 2022 go described above. think they're realizing 

The way phrased CDC currently looking update guidelines ""so to"" leads think they're going drop big bomb outright declare vaccinated people mask everyday establishments unless house rules somewhere asks 

Because he's never quite forward possibility Good, virus over. Ohio. Rural white republicans getting rate should. lot work ahead us undo Trumps messaging last year. authors articles like running time keep writing them, lmao. US government quite aggressive handing money people businesses pandemic:

- PPP loans keeping thousands affected small businesses afloat.
- Three rounds stimulus checks totaling $3100 per adults, plus unemployment benefits paying least $300 week (was $600) September year.
- COVID testing, treatment, vaccines free US.
- federal government many states freezing evictions. Republican states beginning restart again.
- recently passed American Rescue Plan gives hundreds billions educational institutions state governments

As result, US household finances whole actually great shape:

- [Bank gained $3.3 trillion start pandemic 
- [Home gained 10%, [65.8% homes
- [Household debt service payment % disposable near time low 
- [Household net time high, surprising considering well US stock market doing. 54% American household stocks 
- [Real disposable personal significantly 2020, far fewer venues spend, [Personal spiked

Of course, generosity federal government price:

- [Total federal government debt % soared likely exceeded [level reached hand, due declining interest rate, [federal government interest expenses % significantly levels reached late 1980s early 1990s

Distribution wealth also uneven. 2/3 done well, especially top 10%, bottom 1/3 really suffering. overall financial condition Americans good, much work needs done. domestic born variants evade immune protection fine? think 85% necessary reach herd immunity threshold COVID-19, regardless restrictions place. 

For case, R0 would need 6.7 coronavirus (1-1/R0). FYI, Disney changed mask taking pictures policy. take mask pics now. Ya know what? Spike football. Take victory laps.

Worth it. I've heard, adverse effects vaccine typically relatively immediate -- occurring within weeks. 

Are examples vaccines identifiable ""long term effects""? immunity, course Exactly this. bet people 54 willing take 55+ crowd. never good evidence outdoor mask mandates anything all, fact took long officially reach conclusion really discouraging. long take reach conclusion making vaccinated people wear masks setting nothing? there’s good reason keep restrictions anyone wants vaccine easily get it? Yeah, figured got 70% would accomplishment 80+%, WOW. Death rate plummet many Astrazenca vaccines guys still holding using? going lift embargo’s raw materials control others create vaccines countries. going continue hoard protect 2nd amendment rights continue kill people?...all world want people get vaccinated, can't act like means masks distancing forever. need actual reason get it, return normal fantastic one.

The reason wear masks save lives.  

If ""normalcy"" wearing masks means hundreds thousands people die, good idea. made convincing argument people stop wearing masks.   

We need look medical public health reasons wearing masks, even someone vaccinated. seem assuming good reason wear mask vaccination.  

Two reasons would 1) vaccinated people catch COVID spread others (the vaccine stop even reduces it) 2) vaccines may less effectiveness certain variants, making even likely vaccinated people spread COVID (which result deaths people long term health problems. launching el salvador Yes please do. 20% 65 is… lot.

Pfizer Surely, year’s worth data, including really solid real-world evidence vaccine effectiveness, including effectiveness vaccines preventing transmission, able make reasoned estimates metrics restriction lifting. “we don’t know” excuse sounds like absolute bullshit point take Tylenol it’s recommended take shot Fauci hinted latest presscapades change coming soon, when. CDC breakthrough case data *has* influence guidance sooner rather later. municipal health secretary, Daniel Soranz, predicts vaccination schedule maintained Ministry Health continues twice weekly deliveries doses Fiocruz \[AstraZeneca\] week vaccine Butantan \[Sinovac\].

From translation comments. Brazil uses AZ Sinovac  100 dollars week starting 18 1.3 million retirement. Many people new iphones choose save anything year long. know I’d Israel’s numbers total adult population? 60% number didn’t see breakdown. Thanks. states won’t opening vaccine people tomorrow. expect 18+ numbers get lot better next weeks.

That's spearheaded private industry.  got full vaxcine room mate complete disregard social distancing comes getting laid. Weird- percents kinda mirror voting turn age. I’m proud considered adult regulation government *restraining* see onerous regulations. sure one lifts it, domino effect quickly occur. I'll take whatever becomes available here. Appointments nearly impossible right now, opened everyone 16+. That's exact progression went through. even stand morning went two days barely eating. day 3 absolutely fine. glad fully vaccinated now. You’ll see decline end week. exactly last year. Due natural immunity vaccines March/April wave year much lighter, Northeast pretty much plateau, last year hospitals packed. daily deaths continue fall, last year 1K deaths day year. mention missing deaths last year. mid May super super low US. Good question...I wish optimistic response don’t think know what’s going yet. certainly appears could rare event caused vaccine. However t’s means conclusively proven yet. 

And rate 1 million know treat it’s still pretty safe. roughly 5 million chance anaphylaxis Pfizer ask wait fatal untreated. medical treatment ever 0 risk. past vaccines also rare adverse reaction risks. Yet generally consider safe don’t give second thought. 

Now it’s certainly possible future learn what’s going one fact safer another makes sense use safer one. don’t think us married J&amp;J life. whichever vaccine got. doctor said that? basis? even know made flu shot got last year? it’s every year? vaccine seriously reduces symptoms helps body successfully fight full-blown infection. mean cannot still contract spread disease, disease less effective you. immunocompromised still need help. Normalizing wearing mask also prevents spread diseases well, big deal wear them, wash hands frequently care others regard. far biggest factor.

Age Education level pretty close even though factors. Vaccines work. Vaccines work. Get it. Can't discriminate due disability. Person says disability. Forcing person disclose disability big no-no per ADA. Even so, I'm sure there's tons docs make killing pumping letters. also, watch local mandates. FL state wide, DeSantis killed local agencies enacting fines, larger counties still ""Please it"" mandates place. Orange County Mayor Smooth Jazz Voice (seriously, listen Jerry Demings press briefings... would listen man read phone book) removes mandate, I'll feel comfortable. team following CDC best here. jealous 😞 good tho! I’m sad probably won’t receive first dose end year can't speak Universal, Disney serious CMs actively enforcing it. Kids 2 exempt, otherwise everyone wear one anytime eating **while seated stationary** (b/c people getting drinks/popcorn/turkey legs excuse walk around maskless). Downside can't even drink water line. Even pictures allowed maskless, ride photos, anyone photo took mask off, pull photo system like someone flips bird. shoes I'd hold Disney now. anyone get one can't get appointment. seems little pedantic split hairs whether can't get one pharmacy enough I’m mainly worried school comes CDC businesses open max capacity masks likely go away naturally lack enforcement. However, I’m hoping school starts fall restrictions. any, That’s gonna piss everyone rightfully won’t necessary. Yes, vaccines aren’t 16 year olds doesn’t matter. :(

Hopefully surge handled. going keep producing distributing vaccines fast humanly possible non-pharmaceutical things safely effectively can.

Wyoming embarrassing mile. whole state purple map. put target. 75% Americans get vaccinated, restrictions end. patriot act nothing pandemic Oregon’s efforts suppress transmission. one never sense smell, yep, brutal. Underrated issue several areas keeping safe. Every *adult*. people trying weasel kids ""everyone offered vaccine"" endpoint (because theoretical ""long covid"" risk? knows.) Despite disease cold children. got back week Disney World serious masks parks. CMs enforcing constant announcements guidelines including letting know throw refuse comply. take mask pics. saw bit less enforcement Disney Springs still would say 95% people wearing masks correctly. someone said child 2 required wear mask 3 year old looks young maybe he/she get away it. kids saw issues masks. great time would recommend going it’s first time. shows canceled fireworks parades getting full experience. great deal Florida resident I’ve times could count worked out. I’m proud one people, whoop whoop! 3,005 people died Pfizer/Moderna? Funny paused J&amp;J even mention deaths. Yet look up, say can't find direct link. Sure believe that! WINDMILLS WORK WAY

GOODNIGHT It’s opposite. People stronger immune systems (younger) stronger immune response. You’re getting sick shot. immune system reacting. 80% doses applies Sinovac, so... J&amp;J trials found Active group... side effects remember injection site bruised good week, nausea next day. election day, shot, general nerves? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

So yeah, occasionally brain goes ""Wait! sure?"" You’re measuring numbers 1 county.

I’m sorry large event. It’s going statewide see effects. People coming entire state game. far, haven’t seen major changes state level. Nope. misunderstood. 
More 80% number elderly people city Rio de Janeiro.   
Not related nursing homes.  
Nursing homes part first phase vaccination. got first dose late January second dose suppose yet February. One shot rlly convenient husband last family vaccinated hit two weeks post vaccination Friday. Today got hug nieces (too young vaccinated parents fully vaccinated) first time year. Look bright side: least know planning get vaccinated. It’s rose refuse I’m concerned  seem forget one vaccine  restrictions lifted Memorial Day? No, new cases young people vaccinated yet.

I'm shocked everyone missing important detail.   district leans heavily red around try get appointment there. husband cut 2 weeks wait time first shot driving 20 minutes next county over. definitely set back vaccinations world. South Africa suspended AstraZeneca Johnson Johnson Ah cool funded Moderna $1.5 Billion. It’s ok acknowledge good things, even they’re “other side.” even watch CNN ok...? Tells need know though. LOL! entire post history anti-democracy, Pro Facisim, anti-biden. 


Also said true administration aides confirmed it, every news organization american confirmed it. entire plan ""leave governors"" Dude... goal CANNOT eradication. That’s impossible pipe dream achieved smallpox... goal minimizing hospitalization speak doctor, especially regarding medications. Logistically tricky two-shot, cold-storage vaccines think needs available local pharmacies without appointment. Many people desire navigate appointment scheduling, modify schedule get somewhere that's potentially inconvenient order get shot. What's more, segment population go steps think they'll charged.

But set every Walgreens, Walmart, CVS, Rite Aid supply shots signs people walk store get shot FREE? probably scoop good portion folks otherwise bothered. feels like football team 35-0 4th quarter kicks FG claim credit shut out. 

He may fucked 95% whole operation, time nothing, mostly successfully stopped harm. young people getting vaccinated yet stubborn.

I'm tired news, politics shit China somehow. Again, long term effects usually seen risk older people. Yes young people get them, common.

I'm boiling family vs family. I'm saying viewing public health issue myopic lens absolutely selfish. mean force get vaccinated, whatever want, consequences decision affect people even know.

Or look one many articles. one states half. told wifey 20mins ago. little history first. covid late October. 1 day high fever, 2 next days fever taking ibuprofen paracetamol, 4th day vertigo got bed, fifth day totally fine. symptoms all. almost end April i'm starting feel energy breathing getting back normal. breathlessness exercising. breathlessness climbing second floor January. heart palpitations tho. 

&amp;#x200B;

Get serology test (anti covid IgG antibodies ) see got infected January. think sports meme. players fighting field, announcers might say ""you hate see it."" Even though lot spectators actually enjoy watching fights. ""You love see it"" flipping phrase around. think used lot r/cfb r/nba becoming mainstream. Could totally wrong though Agreed, naturally infected ppl contribute heard immunity, extent (and possibly duration) vaccinated. conversely, people pcr positive second time still contribute partially herd immunity, given lower viral loads. 

One thing note mrna vaccines 90% efficacy preventing infection (pcr positivity) overall study populations (older average age study). still, 10% vs 20% pcr positivity mrna vaccine (all ages) natural infection (young only).

Plus, overlap vaccinated infected populations (some vaccinated 50% also 20% natural infections ) can't give Trump credit it, brah. Yeah classic case setting goals already pace reach political gain.

Say Trump OWS resounding success. number confidently give 96%. probably lot less that, know several months reach it, overshot mark.

The problem different different things really anything go by. 95% bad measles, bad, could 70 80%.  mRNA vaccines might (it valid compare like this) effective technologies makes harder mixture. claiming Israel reached 55%, seems bit low me. Variants matter too, new variant emerges twice bad current (already twice bad original) need even more.

At least flu. flu mutates far even 100% work. Still worth getting flu shot though. wrote — Israel block passage vaccines purchased Palestinian Authority Hamas, donated them, fact ""Israel controls borders"" practical relevance Palestinians' ability obtain vaccines, certainly somehow magically make Israel's responsibility buy vaccines them. also wrote — even Israel block passage vaccines WB Gaza, logical argument make would Israel stop that, gift vaccines. Line article literally says hospitals flooded.

Do know 50 isn’t statistically significant? Do
You know trending average variances? know compares past data?

Stop making things support agenda They're worse children  Peru :( *Doctor Strange entered chat* US? FDA approval either.

but yet, soon. moderna pfizer 6 months data required FDA approval declined funding, like say didnt get offer.  usual pro-tip go political map area look reddest zip code find call there. 40ish percent republicans hesitant get vaccine, places likely open spots. cases, maybe, overall, really. Science changes lot faster laws repealed. That’s still lot bogus, outdated laws books long make sense.  vaccines need, ones preferable?

I want make sure body handle negative effects, I'd like feel like crap possible.

I'm currently three medications (venlafaxine, risperidone, methylphenidate), body immune system stress pretty severe adrenal fatigue. like die, seeing congenital heart condition puts high risk. guess teachers important huh? reaction second. huge wave sleepiness 6 hours first day, real feeling illness. first one made feel 3 days made arm hurt like mofo.  bit misleading - article says they’re fully enrolled waiting data. “few weeks” they’re going apply 12-17? already applied? Maybe believe everything CNN tells you. Interesting contact trace confirmed student school infectious period interview staff contact. sent staff students based this. also pull bus footage check bus situation. busses close contact gold mines. aren’t though. literally opened eligibility 1b 1b+ day. included bunch frontline workers, people risk conditions, working service industries. Teachers shouldn’t priority groups, think it’s simply oversight system. reference eligible month could find appointment, available slots left teachers, clearly means don’t need 5-6 open every day week select another criteria, shows openings 5 days. Riddle that. China caused pandemic eat wild animals keep unsanitary conditions. lied entire world pressured play along.
They also lie infections.
China, amazing let's get travel around world, that's exactly everyone needs. Moderna. Thats plain ignorance, 2 conditions same. Cries Dutch zero intuitive policy making since January vaccine rollout. Needs carrot hesitant - carrot opening ditching mask life. boyfriend wants really easy appointment necessary. says he'll get walk place ask it. He's bit privileged honestly considering world access vaccines like Americans do. Apparently lot depends age &amp; reactive immune system covid maybe know it. end immune either way takes 2 weeks get full immunity peoples systems hit panic button young people stronger reactions, ramp strong reaction faster.   doctor, I've read various people claiming doctors online. young children health concerns still can’t vaccinated. kids I’ll feel much better. truly scum earth wear mask I'm enjoying shit outa life staying home, would wear mask sit room drink soylent die UK things going well. giving 45+ right now, half population least 1 dose believe. Everyone offered within couple months process opening lockdown. 

Rest Europe significantly worse general, though mixed bag countries. lots tensions regarding supplies, additional concerns AZ vaccine countries fully stopped using. booked first dose booster shot. Hell yea.  jumped I’ve long frustrated diligently older folks turn vote younger folks seem take get going. ponder things would like 80 % 20 year olds voted 20% 80 year olds voted. seems like might able take longer “future view” younger folks influence. thread about...  that's personal right. fully agree well. personally weighed risks pros cons going what's best. person said they're going wait feel like Covid much threat personally right. 

I'm saying downvoting people disagree sub needs less of. I'd love see someone start gathering data see there's discernible rhyme reason people react vaccination.

I'm 36 year old male good health. got absolute devastated second shot (felt nothing first - hardly even sore arm). got around 3 PM basically felt fine rest day - maybe bit it? could power suggestion. Either way, went bed midnight thinking ""Well, hoping mild symptoms least could take free day tomorrow, oh well..."" hours later wake chills, sweats, body aches, nausea, etc. go downstairs trying putzing around computer minutes basically felt like gonna keel 20 minutes. Went lay barely vertical rest day. 101 fever periodically day. genuinely sickest I've adult life. Fortunately next day mostly subsided, third day back normal.

Some guesses rocked hard: 1) Pollen season, maybe fact allergies already getting hammered factored and/or 2) flu nearly 30 years maybe body cope well immune response. Pure speculation though. I’m planning going 12 days second shot too. can’t imagine 2 days make massive difference vaccine* gah visit Biden weekend, call CEO Pfizer, Prime Minister Suga, said enough doses Japanese citizens 16 end September. fact vaccine they've approved Pfizer limited supply made disaster roll out. they're considering dentists administer shots, ability administer shots needed. vaccine Publix give? perfectly fine second moderna shot mother younger sister struggled day after. personally, think taking multivitamin, extra vitamin D, zinc, drinking electrolytes hours shot allowed next day okay! help current leader also abject moron. Oh anti-vax people ask whether would medically affected drug matter time required least one vaccines.

Man, almost like ""anti-vax conspiracy theorists"" onto something people wanting mandated vaccination every minor facet life even though data know COVID would support absolutely none it. forgot everyone doesn’t give #%*% transmission anyone else’s health, also trained think nothing worry covid. like trump Obama economy countries population pyramid top heavy. believe India skews incredibly young. sun always shines TV. *only* cold, people would bad feelings people wearing mask. news kids? saw something 12-15. might younger kids eligible? *cries essential Canadian worker I've got four year old daughter would feel unbelievably terrible let anything happen could prevented. Best luck you!  No, EU exports ""nudges"" would like see implemented get people fence get vaccine?

I'm going exclude ""lifting restrictions"" here, obvious, would common response here. 

Lotteries?

Taxes? understand that's intuitive. effects virus

Well, get injected virus, I'm sure aware that. also consider soreness arm ""issue"", yes soreness. OP describe swelling size grapefruit, loss hearing, sleeping 10 hours... really? Again, maybe happened, I'm pretty cynical point.

The sad state world many people distinguish anecdotes evidence situation right idiots refusing get vaccinated. trump deserves zero credit. created doubt people’s minds deadliness disease also promoted quack treatments encouraged dangerous behavior. presence pandemic huge net negative world. love got Covid week eligible get vaccine, good know virus actually way deadlier currently is, luck would totally fucked me. vaccine need first one get. US that's going Moderna, Pfizer Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Talk physician potential interactions medication vaccine.  Seriously?! That’s genuinely impressive heard timeline think fully approved?  Excellent post. Thanks. word ""surge"" lost meaning completely. uptick single indicator ""surge"". still experts. Yeah pretty obvious anyone actually paying attention early February. workplace conjunction local hospital, provided shots employees. Turns yes. Prepare trouble, make double! Clearly. idea downvoted. Research needed question answered. Nah cousin Natick lucky get first dose Moderna soon possible. refresh appointment website many times spot. think training regimen ability correct bad habits. quite active /r/running read stories many stories smokers realized bad shape start training eventually stopped smoking started training. believe someone obese training regularly transition period many cases. study could interesting comparing people lot weight loss people stayed weight throughout last 2 years.  Given amount cool parks trails Alaska, hardest part would fit everything want within 4 weeks Yesterday saw live videos hundreds people partying beach, smh couple months ago, many believed people wait end year vaccinated, looks like vast majority EU first shot end 

It looked like well (although I'd say July June change much), people believe everyone suggesting possibility would met jokes ridicule. Gracious Well study says 

```The percentage consistently meeting PA guidelines lower among chronic diseases (including obesity) smoked.```

And point. harder find people train regularly obese group. I'll check out, thanks. person living “developing country” throw vaccines here. 

Here cannot even vaccinate older generation much, quite sad. 

Hopefully, least we’ll able vaccinate soon. couple months ago, many believed people wait end year vaccinated, looks like vast majority EU first shot end June. 

It looked like well (although I'd say July June change much), people believe it. Keep wearing mask even there’s reason to.

It saves lives, selfish anti-maskers care anybody reason appeal deserve way treated everyone even slightly questioned things.

Deserve what? 

Again, yet provide sort argument using logical fallacy. Meanwhile Oregon can't even schedule appointment. whole lot idiots would wear could easily say vaccinated, reality covidiots. looks back year inconsequent leadership disadvantages every state making rules time strong federal solution would've much better.

Similar situation Sweden. 21 different ""regions"", set routines, journal systems etc. Large percentage antivaxxers EU helps speed access vaccines willing take it. Yeah man make like $8-12/hr, nursing home management force come work sick people work nursing homes low income, don’t get PTO sick days.

So yes matter paying people providing better benefits.  Gotcha, clears stuff. Thanks! Gotcha, clears stuff up. Thanks! seems working least keeping alive, frontline workers (doctors, police etc.) vaccinated Phase 1 vaccination drive dying numbers like first wave (which also much smaller second wave). curve certainly looks fitting pattern cresting surge right now. Hopefully get usual month-ish period cratering metrics follows. Yeah probably overkill, COVID going insane India. wanted another layer safety 3 at-risk individuals flat. Amen doses needed AZ/J&amp;J turn ""not good enough"" (future) variant, and/or got AZ/J&amp;J want get mRNA booster later year. 1. recommended early 2020 PPE supply insufficient Healthcare workers reuse. Paper bag used storage would allow humidity escape dries mask off. Water humidity terrible N95 masks rely electrostatic charge plug small particles air. 

2 days sufficient, used 3 days understand virus better Provided vaccines work Indian variants. find hard believe Sweden full wankers. No, thank you. Smallpox Polio unusual animal reservoirs. means actually candidates eradication via vaccine. succeeded smallpox near end polio. 

We never able eradicate disease lives species reservoirs. unlikely Covid go way polio smallpox. 

That mean remain pandemic, likely become endemic continue kill people every year, perhaps many flu, hopefully less. end game Polio Smallpox, also nightmare scenario. probably mean nothing EU coming months, it’s impressive things turned around vaccine wise. 

A couple months ago, many believed people wait end year vaccinated, looks like vast majority EU first shot end June. 

These extra doses give EU security AstraZeneca possibly J&amp;J restricted use. you’re walking dog outside, bother? shows fucked healthcare system US. knew plenty “health care professionals” (aka nurses) spouted bunch bullshit, lucky enough get asymptomatic case. That's ban Wei Shen Lim, chair Joint Committee Vaccine Immunisation, said adults aged 18-29 years underlying health condition puts higher risk serious disease offered alternative COVID-19 vaccine preference Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, “where alternative vaccine available.”

Basically means alternative vaccine available, offer vaccine, otherwise, offer AstraZeneca.

And given dwindling vaccine stock little Pfizer Moderna we've ordered, we'll likely offer AZ anyway.  Given basically curb stomped flu year, yeah, hope people consider masking feel well future. countries combined managed keep Covid deaths 1000. happens mature adult population leaders know put politics aside.

1) state opened eligibility everyone 16+.

2) got better vaccine registration website. actually happened two weeks ago, meant signed late March/ early April (when opened everyone 16+) much easier time signing trying sign January/February.

Yeah, almost 1 100 chance death Covid (and risk past year approximately 1 1000 Europe's US's entire population) vs. 1 1,000,000 chance death J&amp;J vaccine held many nuts basically equivalent. Boggles mind. Must nice. Wish country kept fucking vaccine manufacturing facilities...🇨🇦 Pity us handled thing badly desperate vaccines can’t afford export it. Bragging vaccinations vaccinate desperation pretty sad. believe 20-somethings hesitant. afforded opportunity until...tomorrow, part. 80% elderly aged 60 years older received first dose city Rio de Janeiro.

Well, 55+ statistically likely STIs, depends definition safe gave vulnerable people first. 82 year old mother hesitate moment offered pop-up retirement community. age range Florida lowered, community second pop-up (it's 55+ place). majority entire neighborhood vaccinated start bingo again. soon weekly coffee club, etc etc.

Now mind you, one blue islands Florida's sea red, helps... people ready get back able things. ""Tell people vaccines help prevent deaths made up. NEVER heard once. God visit fucking sub. would ask doctor.

Obviously, generalization incorrectly classifies situation.

Protect ourselves, let get sick, time school back session *then* herd immunity. Moderna #2 tomorrow sound similar; though I'm obviously excited get it, still like ""signing feel like shit couple days."" 🙃😔 Hope feel better soon! wish case canada. Crazy us, third word country failed state repeatedly hear referred to, able put shame essentially every country regards vaccine distribution. Europeans especially ashamed themselves. 2 masks dangerous. 3 masks bust Agreed. Lol

In defense, think freaked careful know could gotten it. can't compare efficacy results trials people high risk groups difficult reach well benefit one dose method (homeless, example). Also we're seeing UK even 'less efficacious' vaccine curbing results. takes helicopter, track ice snow, likely villagers getting Covid-19?

I mean practically self isolating. Australia New Zealand. we’re vaccinated. countries dumb head queue New York, huge amount people see wear mask. I've stopped wearing mine outdoors I'm vaccinated stop wearing someday. called yet thankfully.  Lol. There's point shutting already infected. Could point link ranks these? can't seem find it. don’t know six months however long agree masks incredibly easy effective kept now. It’s upsetting many people selfish irresponsible though. 8x higher chance blood clots covid, vaccine. So. hear sick it, real question *why posting?* subreddit offer you, ""done?"" understand IRL, come back here? like whipped dog returns master's hand, over. claim ""done"" can't stay away.

Look figure 7. second spike March/April don’t think anything governor ... everyone phase 1b opportunity get appointment. no, teachers essential. Yea it’s probably that’s conducted study point stands. obviously still need wear masks couple weeks first dose feel much safer going restaurant, bars, etc. turned 21 March didn’t get second shot till two weeks ago couldn’t go celebrate. Going eat first time year half beer public first time past weekend awesome. can’t wait we’ve got control return form normal.  fly back, get shot, go wherever want lol. good news. poll read back October showed Black Americans significantly less likely willing get vaccine. makes sure child extremely high risk? ZERO deaths 5-15 age bracket, look provisional death counts chart [CDC notice age bracket missing. lump data together (such table top) 0-17, chart breaks further. fact risks virus highly stratified age, includes children comorbidities. Children young even symptoms extreme outliers. Yeah, statement Moderna even going submit EUA. Since original SARS epidemic, location ACE2 receptors disruption well studied giving roadmap key areas investigation.

By February 2020, already seen several case studies investigations impacts testicles, sexual dysfunction, reproductive harm showing virus infecting tissues causing damage.

The problem reports Asia. There's huge anti-Asian bias science medicine, often defended repeating old outdated claims plagiarism. Beast Mode interviewing Fauci fun watch, especially started cursing Fauci skip beat. signed morning. We're scheduled first vaccines Wednesday Walgreens 50 mins away. We're happy get it. Well can't answer that, look example Israel. 56% population vaccinated 2 new cases per 100k people per day. US, 26% population vaccinated Covid case rate 20 new cases per day per 100k people.

Unfortunately, US numbers increasing.

Checked using Canadian vaccine dashboard EU-wide vaccine dashboard. EU dashboard gets updated twice week (on Thursdays Tuesdays), compare Canada's Thursday figure.

So that's 9,205,307 doses administered Canada population 38 million.

And 103,457,179 doses administered EU population 450 million.

So that's 23 doses per 100 people EU 24 doses per 100 people Canada. Thus minimal difference.

EVERYONE asks vaccine have, even elderly people struggle pronounce ""astrazeneca"". *do not* want it.

I tried everything... ""but car ride pharmacy dangerous"", ""but medications also possible side effects, thousands times likely"", ""but risk getting COVID subsequent risk death still way likely""...

Nothing works. Fuck media slowing process. Fuck general population zero understanding risks/statistics/scale etc. one even ASKS medication doctor prescribed dangers, ALWAYS ALWAYS risk AZ vaccine. take every day.

Sorry I'm bit pissed.  completely agree. adding point, countering it. Government must transparent gain trust. “Republicans, \[...\] supporters specifically, likely less confidence government vaccination push,” 

Sorry, read quote article thought Fauci's. Upon reading article again, seems like quote made Anthony D. Dell’Aera?

Unfortunately article seem provide context regarding Fauci's 'disturbing' comment. It’s 30 seconds. asteroid. AKA low risk, less 1 care per hundred thousand per day. US 20 right now, putting us solidly green level, jurisdictions track containment long maintain maintenance levels viral testing (i.e. reference antibody testing) contact tracing, sufficient control spikes outbreaks. Viral testing used symptomatic asymptomatic individuals, latter need testing flowing exposure, role congregate setting critical context (e.g. elective surgery), requirements disease surveillance programs. enough get green; one also plan stay red level, jurisdictions reached tipping point uncontrolled spread require use stay-at-home orders and/or advisories mitigate disease. yellow levels, may initial community spread. orange levels, community spread accelerated dangerous levels. yellow orange levels, jurisdictions make strategic choices package non-pharmaceutical interventions use suppress disease.

Thankfully they’ve controversial here. doctor medical field? *genuinely* believe US “ass backwards” country Earth, especially comes things like necessary infrastructure store deliver vaccine, you’re *incredibly* sheltered.

One vaccines fucking *developed* US, ffs. Sure, health experts certainly claiming COVID anything like flu OP claimed. Even playing importance masks, never downplaying dangers seriousness COVID. course, still concede downplaying effectiveness masks serious blunder. Vaccination Demographics update 2021-04-19

Notes:

* raw data downloaded exact totals every age group downloaded [CDC vaccination demographic trends CSV. CDC indicates data ""Date Administered"", actually appears ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC demographic data, tables match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assuming 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17. look forward South Park character Matt Trey going model Michael Osterholm near future things calm more. That’s I’ll know normal back. I'm willing it, paid not, long monitor take care side effect. virus deadly people peer group, need learn spreads. nuances allow much better guidance behave allow normalcy resume sooner. I'd like see exactly level specificity public health official. need date it'll happen, knowing numbers plenty. sort punishment sort negligence? due largely J&amp;J matter restrictions lifted. good number people vaccinated longer care then. people know included. live Germany. 

There plan we'll probably never even enter step 2. time general population vaccinated, already started boosters. we'll ""be patient"" take another 12 months get everyone booster, point *next* booster ready guess everyone need safe outside house 9pm? Thanks website! would prefer Pfizer maybe use target that. nothing available outside 50 mile radius type though third Pfizer dose still theoretical variants. which, variant would require booster point. something would change. possible, unlikely build robust response first series.
My family spans political spectrum, pretty much treat covid risk same. Mask responsibly, get life get vaccinated, ASAP.  That's quite literally RNA viruses work.

RNA also transferred cells extracellular vesicles similar lipid drop due J&amp;J Curious much anti-vaxxers stuff uk? imagine Boris pushing vaccine means anti-science folks getting shouted center-left center-right? 

That 95% 50+ phenomenal. Asian nations probably get trust government public health, that's better expected country similar temperament. Maybe widespread support public health care system too? Hospital bed capacity misleading statistic actual strain hospitals though. know peak surges Tennessee never exceeded 80-90% bed capacity plenty places put people enough staff properly take care patients. Exactly It’s hard believe story it’s least fourth time pandemic media published exact story. Usually propaganda certain times, like spring break. 

None times accurate. Checking current data, time doesn’t seem accurate either. don’t know they’re trying propagandize against. He's creating resent group people based political affiliation. limitations, studies exist Long Covid.  Isn’t employer asking prove something medically related HIPAA violation? genuinely know I’m lazy look up. We've several months Germany. buy 5 euros per test. Berlin go test center one done free day. get email 20 minutes later result. negative result test center required go shopping. Grocery drug stores require daily test. numbers add well 100% NZ much longer history racial mixing US far people two races.

This true. numbers add 100% way questions asked. “racial mixing” may frowned upon US, still happened time country’s inception categorizing people based voted pointing finger one side

where say that? seems like implying something say... vaccine + mask = pretty damn good chances won’t get sick vast majority vaccinated, right? 10-12 weeks standard dosing interval AstraZeneca Italy. Pretty sure UK throughout Europe, least vaccine.

Pfizer/Moderna shots instead given 3-4 week dosing interval here. Okay, agree anyone divisive, someone divisive call it, rather deflect blame someone else.  Recent data suggesting Michigan's surge already peaked cases going soon. true, we've witnessed end COVID surges United States. often test kids? Israelis massively outbid everybody else Pfizer vaccine, effectively sold citizens medical records Pfizer, exchange priority access. 

Otherwise, vaccine production hard, limited amount production go around world right now, ramping new production facilities takes time. People far critical vaccine rollout worldwide right now.

Yes, issues going individually targeted. overall, fact many countries approaching 1/4 population received vaccine, less 6 months first approved, less 2 years development vaccine started, pretty amazing accomplishment. Viruses time. healthy processes it’s DNA transcribed RNA cannot explain like you’re 5 it’s little complex that. resentment already there, changes nothing. title post says ""prepare party""... doubt it, least another year. Would great tho. ate extra healthy, drink, drank ton water three days prior getting second shot.

Kicked ass regardless semi ruined weekend. Nobody knows precise number. requires knowing R0 virus, depends upon variant discussed, efficacy vaccine, depends upon variant discussed. many unknowns possible reach herd immunity now, lose later due mutations.

What may useful set thresholds based upon cases, hospitalizations, deaths, test positivity. Vaccines push metrics start really matter. think it'll interesting see numbers if/when pause lifted. vaccine still produced delivered, right? glut US. Walk-ins finally possible, people stomach one million risk. state municipality relaxed restrictions degree. um so? Fair enough, definitely underplaying dangers COVID comparing flu OP claimed. necessarily case. Long Covid may result body’s immune response (or response). don’t know. Thank you. Admittedly, understand first, did, huge pet peeve mine. Especially coming source know better. Bummer see rates go like this. need better job “selling” vaccine younger demographic. Compared cases rising four weeks straight, yes incredibly slight decline significant news. straightforwardly shows upward momentum gone.

Ever take math class? We're concerned less raw numbers graph slope. slope turning negative good sign.  One expert ""the experts."" mean, he's probably right, needs consensus become official view. looked sending link twice. thought different poster, sorry.

The map shared ok info deceptive. show hospitalization numbers, cases deaths. several states data change daily cases shaded yellow instead gray. Aside these, enjoyed it. Thank sharing. idea bringing unrelated laws know stance them. completely welcome explain judging someone deciding know someone based religion discrimination. Crazy idea maybe it’s time say vaccinated mask optional. Sure may get people lying also give people incentive get vaccinated. need get less defensive I’m simply saying divisiveness caused one person. trying blame Fauci divisiveness ignores elephant room. simply placing blame belongs excuses. course! I'm calling statement ""experts"" west telling us flu."" OP claiming western scientists downplaying seriousness COVID. simply true. That's always true. Many businesses compulsory vaccination. completely legal require employees vaccinated.

Most employers bother unless serve at-risk populations, put employees risk headache. consider incentives giving employees $100 bonus something way cheaper losing productivity paying sick time weeks. Maybe. Looks like we’ll need 12-15 EUA surpass Israel’s vaccination records. People covid could ""more immune"" variants could antibodies epitopes virus (I've lazy check protein(s) expressed mrna vaccine, iirc spike protein think unlikely mutate). *Cries Canadian* people caring flu He's creating resentment country towards group people voted certain way. divisive. Find state take Belgium Alaska, that's quite trip. data use base opinion of? look studies looking lockdown effectiveness continental United States?

You must formed view somewhere. view come from? clearer. 10-20 % unvaccinated people immune disease + ...

Of course people got Covid vaccinated, too. among unvaccinated, share people dodge Covid indefinitely unlikely high, unless live already highly vaccinated area. worries! Yes, misleading.

Again, good, controlled studies longer time spans, vaccines really well. need misleading statistics. Yeah think recent headline saw 25% Americans saying would reject vaccine. Still leaves us 75% would get Same. it’s detriment times vocal position sentiment. 

Word caution, careful vocal workplace/during career.  Check weekly question thread r/Covid19
I found there. explicitly checking citizenship residency avoid undocumented people hesitant. unless get J&amp;J (currently approved), would still wait around long enough get shots. know get downvoted -- places near impossible get vaccinated. dude wrote script recently find free appointments, like scripts check PS5 stock somewhere. think comes conservative projections met pessimism? That's certainly happened Canada. always conservative projection 89M doses end September (~38M Canadians, ~30M adults) based Pfizer Moderna, got distorted politics pessimism around. end we've consistently exceeded targets looks like people access first dose end June, really less better news coming plan along. 

I think lesson impatient are, things take time. Unless special deal Pfizer, biggest economy planet shut exports, make vaccines, time takes. people tired. Fauci never seems take people get tired burnt especially vaccines came. we’re numbers spreadsheet something 

He’s brilliant doctor awful understanding people. he’d know awful messaging harms vaccination efforts. 

It makes people ask “why bother?” things aren’t changing Pretty sure called life Yeah majority would hope. I've seen gas stations Iowa signs stating remove masks entering. pandemic. messaging 1 month [**2021-05-31 14:45:38 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-05-31%2014:45:38%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide I'm vaccinating mass vaccine site OH.

One questions ask is, ""Have ever tested positive Covid 19 HCP ever told Covid 19?""

I've vaccinated 1,000 people far I'd estimate 5-10% answered Yes that.

The vast majority we're vaccinating covid.

It may different elsewhere. I'm OH/MI border. remindme! 2 weeks still gets 50% chance, know get placebo trial. children

About two weeks prior nobody could buy toilet roll panic buying. totally understand governments expecting people act rationally. Even count half people even one million people, 5800 cases tiny. could take 1st shot never come back second...lol  go work sick infect around them.

Not like afford go doctor could even make timely appointment. That’s wonderful news. might happen July even June DE – cannot wait get vaccination happy everything went fast; even considering fuck-ups, it’s amazing. need citizen health insurance, usually show connection state. Like utility bill shows work paystub showing employer based like school id. may even check that. ""Ay! Ay, Janssen! Wheh'd ya pahk took ya long get heah, fekkin' brighton? Fuhfucksake, guy, get ya shit togetha"" - dude southie morning, probably see. met people like Ive never one though. Lol I'm sure transferred efficacy risk correctly. efficacy understated general population, initial trial participants chosen specifically geographic areas exposure predicted high. actuality, Moderna Pfizer PROBABLY much effective 90-95% random person given place country, environment tested like Michigan NM.

This statement good one make nowhere earth risk exposed 10% right now. think Michigan stat order magnitude high. kind bs making push hard workers rights. lack human decency workforce astounding.

At least I'm glad live California mandated sick days law. Probably big tech censorship, need remove section 230.  JNJ already expected deliver 80% fewer vaccines week next week.... actually slowing bit. 7 day moving average actually touch last week (3.4M per day Tuesday vs. 3.2M per day three drivers delay data release last Saturday led ""bumper"" Saturday, artificially inflating following week creating base effect headwind starting yesterday's JnJ vaccine hold starting filter numbers - even though though make tiny fraction total doses administered, still issues hit increasing number states also acting headwind actually remain fearful?

My fully vaccinated friend still wears *two masks* outside. ridiculous. ""It makes *feel* better"", answer course different different people. got second Moderna last week, felt mild flu symptoms. muscle aches occasional chills first morning, Tylenol spent day normal. This. agree overall, absolutely. I’m saying disagree it’s never “cool”. People wear badge honor don’t take sick day (or vacation days). It’s crazy culture corporate America created. Far many people “live work” opposed “work live”. think it’s coolest they’ve sacrificed literal life company. company could care less humans. Alex? actually Ontario going drop age AZ 40 week read that. Hopefully things change...I read decided export many vaccines, better access. Things change quickly! Thanks info! 9 days me, excited too. telling people think now? waited state opened vaccine appointments everyone getting first shot past weekend, considered lying get early. think honest average person, possible majority want already it.  That's really aging poorly, debating level stupidity 10% population. wear whatever you’d like, know don’t That's asked. sure trying Uno Reverse Card something. :) Exactly. COVID stay, people need get used that. Vaccines keep mostly control. People forget Spanish flu fact H1N1 strain flu bad boy still circulating today. goal get chances getting low requiring hospitalization. also drugs tested stop COVID tracks get it. idea vaccines tools naïve. Life return normal guys, one way another. 

Also, people overdramatic mask wearing sides argument. us wearing required. mandated vaccinated (I already), ain't wearing shit anymore. Anyone know groups school contact tracers? I'm overseeing contact tracing 7 schools.I feel like pretty good however would love see schools going maybe tips tricks new ideas. -Thanks We're still 50% one shot. like 35% both.

Plus teenagers likely summer kids likely that.

Biden say we'd export extras done -- stance Canada.  Unless COVID cases hit zero country/region/province, still wearing mask everywhere go, taking presence people, place that's people badly ventilated

If fully vaccinated, two weeks fully vaccinated, meeting people also fully vaccinated also two weeks fully vaccinated something authorities say reasonably safe. still take mask presence unless absolutely to, still comes much trust people behave respect pandemic.

Vaccines going make safe travel, can't account number people inside plane airport vaccinated.

Vaccines going make safe eat restaurant, largely reasons.

If job, employer likely going force back work point year, already. Vaccination really change still wearing best mask duration shift, still eating yourself, outdoors possible. means slip up, PPE gets overwhelmed point, probably die it.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks Copypasta plenty illnesses prevent someone working even home. People working home exclusively also sick leave. nervous guess. emailed doc questions gotten back me. j&amp;j pause. One question was, fish allergy, go j&amp;j mrna? I've never vaccine reaction, think I'd allergic anything lipid shell mrna vaccines, early story Dr boston shellfish allergy reaction gave pause. know probably getting (my mom recently got pfizer), without getting far conspiracy theory rabbit hole, also like pressure get vaccine feel there's much lack transparency origins virus. I'm overly cautious guess, anti-vaxx. vaccines, kids (except hpv). understanding EUA ends soon long enough? makes feel better.  vaccines great, that's misleading bunch reasons. 

 Example, friend mine became ""fully vaccinated"" days ago (two weeks second dose). He's counted number someone fully vaccinated get COVID it.

Which makes sense. Lets assume got COVID second considered ""fully vaccinated."" Well, would still count someone protected getting COVID, two days long enough symptoms show, get tested, result counted. again, that's got infected first moment.

Obviously, short time scales looking allowed lot people get COVID even vaccine nothing. people fully vaccinated long, due time takes become fully vaccinated daily vaccination numbers higher months ago.

And that's even taking account stuff like demographics people got early vaccines different general population, etc.

In short, better indicators efficacy vaccines trials plus big studies done places like UK Israel. show something like 90%-95% effective, really, really great! Actually; math simply death/population course pandemic chance getting factored in. 55 catches it, chance death even higher. 

The main argument risk J&amp;J individual compelling reason wait. doomsday people almost delusional anti maskers I've read realistically 95%. understand efficacy means situation would 100% gotten Covid, 5% chance getting vaccine. Day-to-day likely 60-70% chance getting Covid 100% chances getting infected vaccine even smaller tried US. closed enrollment locally. :( think stat bit. See reply. milestone come soon yet. Paper bag breathes moisture get compared plastic. We’re already 50% adults one shot. Seniors already 80% still climbing. think we’ll hit close 70% adult population willingly getting it. rest likely waiting mandated whatever reason. “It’s rather get people killed, it’s don’t think pulling trigger guns would kill them” gtfo coworkers husband deciding buy fake card $200 last month, must exist somewhere online.  biggest hurdle money. raw materials embargoed US. They've approved bunch vaccines. I'm guessing discussion US. remember still two weeks second shot till ""full"" status.  get second jab 13 days! excited. fact still spread Covid

Vaccinated people still spread Covid? Technically possible, unlikely extreme caution crowd starting annoy anti maskers. people still think lockdown vaccines, hell endpoint? I'm Nepal (northern neighbor). I'd like get train could. bit jarring year ago would shocked number I'm not. I'm desensitized. 

Its also mind fuck know deaths actually higher number I'm still shocked. world simply chose ignore well others. Maybe people realized empty person social lives thought, brunch overrated, make home, really need that. Maybe people overconsuming fear, last year showed to.  half country taking cues especially cautious 80 year old public health official whose job give people conservative advice possible means slip up, PPE gets overwhelmed point, probably die it.

That's... accurate depiction current knowledge vaccines.

They're highly protective getting COVID spreading it.

They 100% sure case first (though highly suspected), saw guidance like, ""treat like still spread get it"" - definitely still **can** (no vaccine magical virus shield), chances getting COVID fully vaccinated pretty damn low.

If hanging another fully vaccinated person, close safe I'm woman 30 Poland government said nothing it. They've planned use Astrazeneca people younger 70 years old. UK made vaccine, claims safe uses young people. Why? could spread covid can't infected? Gov handed loser (aka forced them). still need sick days even work dome remotely. I'm laying bed doubled pain stomach knots, last thing want worry answering emails filling excel sheets I’m sure funds help we’ve seen far takes 2-3 months production ramp started actually delivers results. don’t know opening everyone 18 may would create huge problem many people wanting something available limited quantities.  here.  time get already better said every adult able get April 2021 back fall Idk many people you’ve met irl, group seems infinitely smaller experience Michigan Pharmacy went didn’t even bother checking ID. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Something something wall street something double standards Lol whole deep cleaning stupid. I’m glad glove/wiping groceries phase didn’t last long. news organizations including New York Times portrayed disease kills 2-3% people (weighted heavily 65+) bubonic plague. 

Can blame people scared constantly telling vaccines might work variant week? blame people maintaining social distancing portray everyone who's seeing people vaccine uncaring selfish? Tl;dr announcement -
1. central govt vaccine drive remains unchanged (age 45 above, essential workers), utilising 50% stock vaccine manufacturers
2. Vaccine manufacturers supply 50% stock directly state govts private hospitals
3. State govts private players utilise vaccinate anyone 18 years
4. Additionally central govt may share stock states case case basis, folks point 1 remain priority central govt. 
5. Lastly, manufacturers receive funds ramp vaccination sure. remains seen. However, media definitely stoking fear variants (whether good bad thing point).. can't imagine anti-vax crowd significantly large. think people eager willing get it.

If not, be, unfortunately. always try get trial. That’s really great see! Hopefully numbers keep increasing see people get vaccine little side effect. data still doesn’t support it’s conservative men though quite factors fuelling anti vax vaccine hesitant sentiment including socioeconomic status (education income) Similar way still contract COVID vaccinated. idea previously infected person odds contracting nonsensical. also far behind vaccinations compared rest Western world. Unless COVID cases hit zero country/region/province, still wearing mask everywhere go, taking presence people, place that's people badly ventilated

If fully vaccinated, two weeks fully vaccinated, meeting people also fully vaccinated also two weeks fully vaccinated something authorities say reasonably safe. still take mask presence unless absolutely to, still comes much trust people behave respect pandemic.

Vaccines going make safe travel, can't account number people inside plane airport vaccinated.

Vaccines going make safe eat restaurant, largely reasons.

If job, employer likely going force back work point year, already. Vaccination really change still wearing best mask duration shift, still eating yourself, outdoors possible. means slip up, PPE gets overwhelmed point, probably die it. People getting vaccine testing positive- anyone explain why? false positive? would nice, since US federalist, that'd difficult impossible. Also, South Korea allows tourists, strangely enough. pay $1500 USD stay two weeks quarantine hotel though. far high efficacy vaccines. mRNA work identified mutants they're fairly easy make booster shots for. 

What going happen going major break things world nations high coverage high efficacy vaccines, everywhere else. variants already evasive immunity mild infections, that's probably good herd immunity. heavyweight vaccines produce *much* stronger response. Canadians cross border get cheaper everything else, America jack prices Canadians Canada's levels. 

This vaccines rich specifically. hit 50 percent adults least one dose vaccine, even open say vaccinated mask distance, half people telling truth, number gets 60-70 percent getting closer mattering someone lying vaccinated stances.

The issue kids teens access vaccine.  Trump told believers wear patriotic could gotten crazy half Trump rest science.
So impossible tricky. ""All"" info backing statement animals? I’m farmer ave I’ve reluctant start tours haven’t found much justification concern.  got legitimate source ""the vaccine fucking women's periods""? place I've come across claim anti-vaxxers like you. There's assurance we'll hit herd immunity. we’re vaccinated

Because countries live middle nowhere even densely populated Also everyone gets access vaccine give shit. I'm protecting vulnerable, get vaccinated don't, I'm locking save dumb ass. areas afraid of? medical costs valid, areas afraid of? They're unsafe. That’s total population %. post talking adult population. FTA: adults every U.S. state, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico eligible Covid-19 vaccine, meeting April 19 deadline President Biden set two weeks United States administering average 3.2 million doses day, roughly 2.5 million month before. 131 million people, half American adults, received least one shot Sunday, according Centers Disease Control Prevention, 84.3 million people fully Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island Vermont last states expand eligibility, opening vaccinations adults Monday. Nice, that's dream. means hoops. Testing takes time. understand need rush mean every FDA approved vaccine. can't unilaterally impose measures anymore religious assholes Haridwar. 
The Modi government completely failed country. Europe rest world

The EU done 100 Milions vaccinactions exported 110 milions. agree would protect others get vaccine protect others? others get vaccine protect themselves?

As things opening number states running full tilt months weeks. Hell Texas numbers DROPPED removing mask mandates opening 100%. hand states like California New York harsh lock downs cases/deaths per capita states like Florida open majority everything. paper mediocre best, would surprised passes peer-reviews. 

It incredible job cherry-picking data ignoring much larger dataset EMA stated AZ conference.  Dude here. I'm NJ trying get shot anywhere damn near impossible. Walgreens/CVS - booked. NJ official - there's 1 vacc site shows 88 miles away... I'm jersey city like really desolate place. Luckily got first NY (work NYC, that's eligibility), second one might funkier getting axed end month, actual vaccine following saturday Honestly none checking point. would mattered month two ago supply constrained shots wasted lack demand. 

Just tell moved happy give one. Oh. seem rather good true. Yay!

It's relief hit point. sex, stop taking medication cause side effects stop taking it. Stopping birth control cause weird side effects. probably life threatening uncomfortable. suspect long appointments needed walk-ins accepted. fact sites like Benz Stadium Atlanta started that. everyone different theory haha. young effects more, covid effects more, facing west get shot effects more...

The first Pfizer shot knocked day, think means rightful Queen England. think preemptive so. C19 simply us long enough make call.   pandemic ending soon you’ll find something else feel smug about. scares you. need much safety operate life, make personal choice sit room drink soylent die. way making ridiculous choices one else. I've talked people this, basically going social end pandemic June/July people USA. many people vaccinated people stop following lot restrictions, even areas trended toward heavier handed approach. combine plummeting hospitalizations deaths, nicer weather, vast amount Covid fatigue, etc. see mask mandates realistically enforced beyond point *in situations*. add caveat end suspect places large numbers people ""captive audience"" type setting (like, airplanes big sporting events) effort keep place areas awhile longer. think like, local bar going keep enforcing etc. Good you, expect everyone else carry wearing masks longer needed. Thanks reassurance! Imagine getting Yale going Anti-Vax can't take head ass. thing. actually told nurses beforehand put back room lay down. Good thing clonked like 10 minutes got it. moderna shot side effects stronger second shot. kicked 10-12 hours later. worse usually experience bad allergies feel slightly cruddy. feeling fine end next day. know people worse time it, side effects severe enough lay day.

Still, totally worth would again. India's population large compared available vaccine stocks easily go next six months enough people lining take available doses even anti vaxxers covidiots excluded. Let sit sulk get paid sick leave normal.
If choose working cold getting paid usually choose former. “If wealthy powerful lining get shots, that’s means everyone know it’s good thing get” -Obama

lol, see he’s getting there, I’m sure that’s best messaging could used.

Otherwise, cool this. Idk move needle anyone, doesn’t hurt try “plan” make Mexico pay border wall. It’s technically plan, someone said Trump real plan pay border wall, even they’re technically wrong, would understand meant.

The funny part initially plan literally Mexico write check one time payment pay it. Later walked back said would pay trade tariffs whatever said. schedule appointment Yes, may side effects immediately shot. Personally, sore arm 36 hours first dose Moderna. We'll see anything else second dose. heard severe nausea; suspect that's common. actually, I'm kind looking forward brief side effects, them. almost like rite passage.

As long-term effects--it's true know absolutely *everything* vaccines. mRNA technology (used Pfizer Moderna) development since 1990s. Moderna entered clinical trials March *2020*, year ago. almost *billion* doses administered worldwide: importantly--vaccines like pills. thing keep taking long term. That's one reason long-term side effects rare *any* vaccines there. According vaccine scientist Deborah Fuller, Fuller said chances long-term complications extremely unlikely vaccines “Most job done first days, vaccine gone body. what’s left immune response vaccine,” Fuller 110+ millions vaccines exported Yea really think it'll happen simple vaccination mind goes wild leading moments.

It sucks embarrassing. I'm sorry deal also. Ok since article really based data, let’s say hospitals admitting everyone, like say person covid dehydrated mild fever, need fluids, whereas before, people given meds sent home without admitted. Let’s say we’re throwing around unfounded claims, we’ll jump throw around unfounded claims. spoke CDC best could tell may worse less severe reaction. So...they know. also gave link database search own, can't make sense search. Here's link though Fair point think simplify bit there. suspect difference relative differences spikes produce. I'm vaccine expert means. Nah, worry it. tiny chance. Two weeks final dose I've seen definition ""fully vaccinated"".

Practically, ten days dose one relaxed behavior somewhat, since point pretty well protected according data I've seen. Two weeks shot two, I'll relax behavior bit more.

I still dining indoors mask requirements lifted locally. expect sometime summer. I'm back outdoor dining less paranoid masking outdoors. Thats website state said, needed ID &amp; form sort showing youre resident here. Trump told big deal dead worse going pubs couple weeks might me. me. First shot raise arm quarter way up.

I’m looking forward day confidently say 100% people want vaccinated, vaccinated. point on, start handing Darwin awards. I'm 14 years old get flu I'm usually school 4-5 days. imagine reaction Covid would even worse. know die that's I'm afraid of. I'm tired people assessing risk die not. much goes it.

In short, I'd rather feel bad 2-3 days sick entire week paid attention Dr. Fauci said recent report government (where verbally attacked ultra-conservative), might know. Ytube. Check out. 

Y'know, childish make human decide universe store us. virus could mutate something mild, case around decades, could burn becoming deadly killing everyone touches, case, *gone*. 

How world would Dr. Fauci know way turn? knows need vaccinate everyone fast can. We'll need booster shot Fall. rest it: prayer. We've drinking silly park last 3 weeks. Everyone seems pretty happy except owners pubs without gardens. Thousands athletes worldwide. really understand wasted many months this. study suspect well.

The main reason study suspect done Oxford university, *the developer AstraZeneca vaccine*. Nice work J&amp;J obviously hired PR firm... obvious reasons. honest, might influence people way like. Link suggests even reinfected leaa likely spread seronegative recruits, seropositive recruits 10-fold lower viral loads (ORF1ab gene, p&lt;0.005), trended towards shorter duration PCR positivity (p=0.18) frequent asymptomatic infections (p=0.13). use fact checking site see claim plan false. nothing wrong that. happy presidents competent comes vaccine. Same. sucked got done. one looking IDs. go cvs website exactly midnight -- extended family Sacramento got way  looking Google vaccination tracker Alaska, seem pretty in-line rest country getting vaccinated far think places still pretty fucked. think pretty recently opened general 60+ group eligible get vaccinated. probably ridiculous, way CVS getting second dose Moderna, inadvertently inhaled second hand smoke someone smoking nearby. left quickly, concerned Covid transmission? Again, know probably ridiculous, I’m anxious since literally got vaccinated, would like get this. quite tell full story - firstly, NHS data cover deaths outside NHS (care homes, home etc.), secondly, always fewer deaths recorded weekends.

Tomorrow's numbers UK dashboard relevant: Thanks! Got 1st Pfizer shot today. Gold standard! yeah that’s problem, one thing u ill positive test, totally another it’s “i’m sure i’ve it, cough last spring i’m good” birth control carries much higher risk AZ. I'll take first vaccine get.  good rule thumb analyze variant news is, try make sound like X-Men, less worrying actually He's actually completely correct. remember telling us shove light disinfectant collective asses Why? risk something lasts months something lasts days? Lol think boomers anti-mask? see generation. I'm surprised ""moderator"" taken post down, because""vaccine"" ""politics"" mentioned sentence. posts, could never mention two together, comment would removed. related note, makes uncomfortable kept referring Mr. Biden. 14 days last negative test pre vaccine checklist forms check. Dude free krispy kreme doughnut everyday year motivation needed. You’ll getting comments people say “the pandemic over!”  medically certain they've COVID last 6 months, I'm maybe onboard logic. 

Unfortunately, I've heard many people say, ""I'm pretty sure already it."" But, course test results prove it. Already place town work in. 

Last May June, Local butcher shop town posted Facebook page could wear mask store. Said much risk getting robbed person face camera. people comfortable could order curbside. 

So people pointed could still employees wear masks issue robbery chances. 

The post long think gotten lot health dept visits year sounds it. hand, side effects second dose lol. Arm sore little day got felt great next day Alberta Something tells vaccine take among brightest humans going much issue. feel frustration. Hang there! in-laws scary trumpsters planning get vaccinated, said absolutely way would able see kids person unless masked outside short visits. held firm ended getting vaccinated. mil texted okay trump got vaccinated Ivanka. Um sure, long got , Bubbie. I’m duel citizen living Canada, would able go US get vaccinated? Long terms risks (2+ years) compeltely unknown point, thats worried about. really really hope none.

This incredibly dumb argument. know long-term effects COVID, willing take chance getting COVID instead? afraid long-term effects absolutely get vaccinated. Well extreme short term risk seem range anywhere side effects dibilating nauseau couple days, would like risk possible.

""Extreme"" short-term effect called immune system working, people (like 20s) mild sore arm nothing more. 

Lastly, missing point vaccination meant protect yourself, around you. choosing vaccinate, harm others, mainly can't get vaccinated risk regardless vaccination (like people organ transplants). incredibly selfish decision.

“Masks aren’t necessary”! Oh yeah, it’s around month. Israel many (I think more) people 18 fraction population US does. Israel also natural immunity people covid (though probably somewhat less US). observation that, one country, cases plummeted 50-55% total population vaccinated. Nature’s vaccine definitely comes higher risk side effects. minutes. fair coworker sent link. seem huge desire get vaccinated (Philadelphia)

That's **if** catches Covid. keep mind everybody gets two three months takes wait pfizer vaccine. Lol second shot exact first. ingredients amount they'll simply first dose this. provide protection, one knows long. Lmao edited comment add Lol yeah ok Largely agreed. easier people (at least people work there) avoid places compared stores decide risk they're willing take. Yeah, almost 1 100 chance death Covid

**If** catch Covid. That's given. Versus 1 40,000 chance AstraZeneca kill you. Obviously people going wait another couple months. We're fucking COOKING here. Love see corner US kicking ass vaccinations Cases dropping possible explanations might be:

- Chinese exaggerated efficacy vaccines 

- Chile’s numbers aren’t anywhere close accurate. Israel violating convention:

The PA healthcare. taxes Palestinians occupied territories go Israeli healthcare, go PA.  hard getting appointment? Getting first dose took hours trying get appointments, plus 1.5 hour wait mass vax site half hour house.

Once things done without appointment pharmacy, uptake go prime minister Modi giving vaccines countries improve image, still holding state elections rallies. He’s moron. difference US many people many different views, impossible enforce anything. Plus, state laws generally overshadow federal laws, even federal mandate, state like Texas Florida could vote ignore it. Let’s go boiiiii!!!! Great news, getting worried. Ok ready surge warmth, really freaked out. first shot Moderna Saturday, waited 15 minutes fine, husband driving home got warmth/numbness flush entire body. dissipated bit, left behind lightheadedness rest day. 330 million people, bound lottttt idiots dealing sample size large means slip up, PPE gets overwhelmed point, probably die it.

No, really. much protective that. India 4,000 major cities, even assumed 1 death/ per city/ per day we’d looking 4,000 deaths daily, yet India reporting around 1k+ deaths per day entirety India.

Soon, one extra case day youd call surge. Short answer: depends 

Long answer: states require residency eligible vaccination although loosely enforced point. states may ""theoretically"" require permanent resident US went fine print. practice, probably get vaccine show appointment, especially border town common issue. Almost two week waiting period second dose. Looking forward getting back work seeing tolerable humans. 2k? 100$ would suffice lot people Two weeks quarantaine two weeks ended, four weeks.
However still like ACDC maybe get tested again. Username check out.   agree  Youyang Gu predicted *to day* current wave would crest.

From [his predicted peak infections April 11. according Twitter, yesterday's 7-day average first week-over-week decrease thirty days. Yesterday 18th, subtract 7 days, arrive April 11 date infections peaked. I’m sure go months without sex girlfriend :) realize Japan recently started vaccine rollout it’s going *very* slow there? Japan hit pretty rough covid right now. Tell me, many EU take then.

Every complaint EU ""Oh they're going block exports"" haven't, ""They're going take doses UK"" haven't, ""They're going take 10m doses India"" also haven't. restaurants bars might well mask distancing mandates Excuse ignorance young least likely need vaccination?

Let's wait lab data drawing premature conclusions. world safe 90%+ effective vaccines *exactly world live in*.

Even contagious variants, COVID-19 max R0 like 5. able eliminate endemic spread measles incredibly contagious - R0 12-18.

COVID like flu. limited animal pathways comparatively stable genome defining transmission protein targeted (the spike protein). Material vaccine escape highly unlikely.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Long covid wide spread internet would lead believe. around one third half people hospitalized long covid defined symptoms least 6 weeks onset.

Let's look compared hospitalization rates vaccinated people. 5800/77 million infected vaccinated 4 8% hospitalized. That's 348 people. 348 people 114 could assumed long covid. So, 114 77 million means 0.00014% chance getting long covid fully vaccinated. getting data back 90-95% protection would ""nearly completely eliminated"" eating Michigan restaurant? get risk would obviously higher eating New Mexico, say protection would almost eliminated seems like stretch. Fully vaccinated people fact spread virus. Definitely far less likely vaccinated, it’s possible Schools cesspool every sickness including flu, new, exceptionally contagious virus... Truly, listen either I'm anti-masker. Fauci trying manipulate us alternately taking health risk seriously taking seriously. trusted nuance. Imagine reacting article Michigan ending surge without lockdown handwringing fact Michigan instituting lockdown... EU exercised contract option buy 100 million vaccine doses Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, bringing total number doses vaccine delivered 2021 600 million. That's works, 77 million people vaccinated exposed covid. expect CDC drop mask wearing guidelines? I'm spreading misinformation. Yes paid received. also signed agreements put ahead countries due price future shipments signed for. pay future shipments pfizer halted PLANNED sending. Schools Maine open months majority counties green entire time. area go red, happen often. Schools part, safe. assume skipping “extra” needle “fully” vaccinated 3-4 less weeks. Silly. likely mostly people want one done, don’t patience want put effort get j&amp;j effort sticking man well worth it. agree others prove significant problem large scale. relatively nitwits. ""NZ Australia put bottom list"" particularly defeatist way putting disregards agency countries' governments outcome. like allocation reliant COVAX w central dictator decreeing gets what.

Instead, about, ""NZ Australia made choices &amp; tradeoffs drove outcome they're experiencing.""

Oh they're bottom. NZ least get citizens vaccinated year. That's likely lot better many places... ""They can't lie people greater good."" mean like said wear masks last March worried supply chain healthcare workers getting enough? tough cold though - like yeah sucks get one, actually putting commission hard say ""I'm going spend little time this"".

Really big change needs made people work home conditions (assuming work job accommodation manageable). 

My job exactly backwards right - I'm working home 4 days week working site 1 day week. I'm feeling well 1 day, can't opt work home day - take sick day. me, fine plenty sick time available me. cold, runny nose sore throat, take entire day feels silly. lol can’t take seriously then. You’re saying think state Oregon still mandatory masks due COVID-19 pandemic 20 years now? That’s absolutely absurd know it. Nope, fairly standard procedure. Called human challenge trials. anything surprising done test major vaccines fairly big controversy, even volunteered human challenge trial ultimately never came be. Cases never hit 0. Ever. That’s illogical thinking I’ve ever heard. always appreciate good troll post. Well done ""zero covid completely realistic""

yeah? world virus, sister also. got first Pfizer shot sore arm day two felt little fatigued day so. us. get second shot three days. can't wait tbh. feel great fully immunized! aren’t flat. cases falling still think it’s playing fire continue torpedoing education.

But understand you’re coming from. looks kids least likely severe (or even symptomatic) COVID, see long-haulers. Maybe understand delayed gratification there's reason? takes time vaccinate 300 million people. we're ready country take next step together.

Michigan cautionary tale early stop trying, ICUs still fill younger people elderly vaccinated. Personally I'd rather state go road again, end sight months now. masks anything else. come ill. scar smallpox vaccine. It’s ultimate vaccine passport.   Please kindly GTFO know much NZ. US 77% White, 13% Black, 5% Asian. population 14.4% foreign born. 

NZ 71% White, 16.5% Maori, 15% Asian 9% Pacific Islander. numbers add well 100% NZ much longer history racial mixing US far people two races. 

Also NZ 27.4% foreign born, nearly twice rate US. 

I grew Boston lived Washington DC, two major US cities. diversity never close see Auckland every day. Auckland one foreign-born cities world 40% population immigrants, rate NYC LA. news: Missing persons report dropped 50% bill gates find anyone lost Take experience w grain salt spouse bad cases covid towards end 2020 (I hospitalized 4 days). first shots kicked asses. second shots were.. mild first effects much much longer. got 2 shots moderna, need worry refridged stored properly gave people correct doses etc

They top checking things, stored improperly location would call back re-do vaccination. place colorado last week. iternary chance? thinking Alaska myself. mRNA vaccines fantastic absolutely discouraging them. J&amp;J good enough age level risk. 70 health issues, would absolutely get Pfizer Moderna. Good multiple options. 

We probably need boosters year. experience. feel lucky. shielding allows spikes hidden look pics virus like (scroll see bits virus protrude glycan shielding. antibodies target specific proteins spikes. become hidden behind shielding antibodies become less effective fewer proteins reachable. ""just another weeks""
since march 2020 think besides said US still closed tourists various countries may hurdle potential vaccination tourists reasons.
Also since vaccines require two doses may two trips (pricey depending traveling from) I'm montco, raw case numbers wrong. misremembering painting worst picture really is, comparitively. suggest go MontCos covid data hub. peak holidays 462.9 cases per day, using 14 day average. lowest point 110.6 cases per day. 226.1 cases per day, mostly flat growth currently. swear God Ill personally beat covid 19 summer ruined comments like makes realize media vaccine dirty. Let's break facts only: 
1. Everyone uses argument tested mutations, true even main argument. Pfizer Moderna since tested variants done well. moot point.

2. Page 94-96 Janssen's report state reported numbers 28 days, that's 66-72%, 85%, 100% efficacy mild, severe, hospitalization/death come from. continue read pages see day 49 post-vaccine numbers rise 95%, 100% 100%. B cell response increases time 1 shot. 49 days much longer 5 6 week wait 2 shot mRNA ones, efficacy point. 

3. pages (24-27\* think, let verify second exact page #s) dictate classified moderate covid... included 1 symptoms gastrointestinal issues, coughing, sneezing, fever etc. mRNA trials classified mild cases. metrics exact. 

It's reasons cannot compare two\[3\] vaccines.  
Thankfully US done good job administering vaccines general, current J&amp;J hold impact us much mRNA ones rocking here. Americans. J&amp;J one critical underdeveloped countries. stop spreading misinformation bias fact. Brings tear eye! never coo,l always expected required hard get days didn’t get sick days. with? keep seeing implicit assumption people want artificially prolong pandemic for...reasons? It’s never made sense me. Wtf upvote/downvote ratio check's though 

my gosh, know likely gonna get removed mods, part want's stay see low goes disingenuous lol. 

The EU literally requested ""third world Covid-sticken"" India send 10 million doses AZ. merely ""look it"", EU ambassador posted letter India requesting vaccines, India refused send them.

Sorry that's difficult reconcile, is. wanted say distinction possibly worst comment I've seen sub 2021. Congrats! living delusional world. Glad see getting downvoted much People cut line. reopening. right tell people take risk also allowed protect themselves. Wow. man hate ""let's drag forever crowd""

but seriously, line get drawn get back normal? sure, still catch vaccinated, chances covid cases completely hitting 0 completely unrealistic since without symptoms still going getting tested unless forced to, look flu going anywhere time soon

so fun living fear, us ""real life"" gonna complete opposite Thought CDC site guess not

[94% effective preventing asymptomatic infections, 97% preventing symptomatic say 94% prevention asymptomatic infections 97% prevention symptomatic infections quite close ""almost 100% safe infection transmitting virus."" Pfizer modern already effective J &amp; J one shot. 85%.

It’s second shot adds extra efficacy MRNA add extra J &amp; J. Lets add fact double chances getting rhe virus first week vaccination mix.

People drop guard start going around. school kids go 3ft apart. THANKS, CDC!!! Cases quintupled since summer low December they're currently reporting cases time pandemic. 100? I’m free. Give bag Cheetos idgaf PNW people wear masks hiking dive trail visible horror pass unmasked. HPV hasn’t politicized. Joining 30 minutes. Can't wait! one expecting completely eradicate COVID (outside looney tunes subreddit). 

There plenty us completely comfortable going back living lives effective vaccine reducing spread deaths. eu horrible bad Maybe it’s think perfectly healthy get sick cold twice year. don’t even want think hard next cold going since haven’t one year month. 

There good living hyper-sanitized society. 

B4 everyone rages, yes wear mask. I’m hoping community spread almost nothing start school again. Yep, too. County said Phase 2 people might difficulty getting appointments still Phase 1 people need appointments. Strange, Texas Gov. Perry [made news back day requiring HPV it’s pure theater. argument vaccinated people masked social one. We’re rapidly approaching point that’s longer true US adults eligible vaccine. I’m vaccinated longer wearing mask anywhere it’s explicitly required. effort

I hope so. feel like public messaging solid all. still people know vaccine free without insurance. 4 days me! get shots lets end absolutely stunning day today, nights still bit chilly beer garden though. think pretty safe say point ""Worst pandemic"" projections March come light. Protection comes degrees. 0-100 phenomenon.

Let us say ""resistance"" instead? conveys meaning better.

People barely wanted actually great risk. Even 70%, achieve herd immunity. Life already lit me. havent wearing mask social distancing 6 months now. Traveling, spending holidays family large groups people, amazing. Oh thats me!! got first jab yesterday next one 17th. We're already seeing that. sports events indication, enforcement adherence mask mandates, outdoor events likely see mask mandates eliminated well indoor ones. would probably able go MLB game unmasked summer, NBA game probably time next year. know what’s playing dumb? Acting like it’s unreasonable question. CDC simply said: ‘ risk asymptomatic spread low low enough justify mask removal everyone offered vaccine’. would great. don’t say, hem haw without giving data.

 refuse provide measurable auditable guidance. It’s insanely frustrating science community saying ‘trust us’ without sharing metrics making decisions would change decisions based current conditions. Yes variants possible doesn’t mean don’t answer question context current variants.

Hey now, Diablo Immortal subreddit.

The person responded (not you) mentioned neither seatbelts car seats.

There reason believe risk calculus included based there. try going shopping store covid pharmacy around pharmacy closing hours. Swing ask missed doses. good time, anyone can't make preference throw dose away. busy person call pharmacies ask realistic. Personally 2 weeks post first vaccine would feel great level protection (80 percent). Enjoy Disney remember rain jacket - weather nasty today! Stood line 2 hours yesterday get shot, easily hundreds vaccinated there. They're really best get many possible quickly possible. 

Really happy see many people getting vaccinated. Well, vaccination rate continue grow (it surely will) get first dose 5 months Prior covid kids' pediatrician complained school truancy policies basically forced parents bring kids sick visit solely get doctor's note absence school would excused. 

Not get expensive parents whose families high deductible medical plans, mildly-sick kids office unnecessarily exposes staff patients viruses much fun kid feel better quickest staying home rest. even done science stuff figure safe you. definitely given young children like that, they're nearly risk risks vaccine completely unknown imagine cost that? makes sense. need proof vaccinations doctor go school review state well. yeah state records. another country requires covid vaccine proof ask probably something different card. low viral loads indicate CNS probably main tropism, Covid RNA present CNS autopsy tissue. results saying contradicting? want understand point. that’s true. England restrictions lifted last week restrictions started relaxed 8th March schools going back minor changes. slowly getting there, 45s best guest 40s started mid May, Im 34 Im looking June current rate great see England open back even though makes job harder.

Fauci mouthpiece work country. It’s fair say need research, able eloquently state case remaining restricted. 

Let’s forget CDC said OK travel without fanfare explanation changed. It’s bad science make policy change without pointing associated science. continually growing skepticism better future.

They’re going come say stop wearing mask you’re vaccinated they’ll never say why. fact justification change. It’s disappointing can’t simply tell us conditions recommendation could change. I'm worried abused, we'll see goes.

The problem never able quantify many working days saved. 

If 30 genuine sick days used, 10 playing-hooky days, 60 days saved sick people come infect half office still +20 days efficiency. never able 'see' 60 saved days though, unless tracking work outages several years compare numbers policy change. Aside fact great number people demographic remember polio likely greater understanding importance vaccinations time like this, seems one thing even COVID-skeptic folks concede age HUGE determining factor terms COVID severity want take chances.

Nothing 100 percent, goes without saying.

However, would assume like UK made changes ‘lockdown’ rather locking ending restrictions time comparison pretty subjective. UKs lockdown quite strict restrictions place hasn’t case 6 weeks now, defining ‘very long strict’ accurate. 3 members family work directly covid patients. None vaccine yet.

- don’t get spread unvaccinated people could lead virus learning dodge vaccines don’t exist within them, spread vaccinated folks dramatically cut according new data rolling in

- even happens, won’t happen instantaneously suddenly negate vaccines everybody gets it. They’re working boosters anyway, RNA technology done faster ever before, historic infrastructure grows day. Sore arm common. Fatigue (mild) likely. Less common possible low grade fever, chills, body pain. Typically 1-2 days max kicks around 12 hours post dose. 

To clear majority us experience sore arm mild fatigue worst. could also phrase ""everyone higher risk severe illness death"", everyone makes dangerous living normal life general. think surprised degree vaccination grinds screeching halt everyone wanted one gets one. predict 30% Americans vaccinated. feel like people would want vaccine general fair, they're probably correct think they'll fine get sick. 

I'm young vaccinated, consensus among unvaccinated friends they'd rather wait let others get vaccinated first see surprise long term side effects. think high success rate low complications current vaccines swing lot crowd get available all. could easily continued vaccinating people 45 J&amp;J risk covid clearly outweighs risk vaccine. Stop spreading misinformation showed following second dose vaccine (the recommended number doses), risk infection reduced 90 percent two weeks vaccination. Following single dose either vaccine, participants’ risk infection SARS-CoV-2 reduced 80 percent two weeks vaccination."" Lmao. people wear masks woods? Insanity. see masks restricting freedom I'd rather wear several reasons: blurs glasses, kills breath run, gets entangled earphones... B117 even considered variant UK more? That's main deal point clearly vaccines working well it. they're going make sound extra scary vague ""variants"" tag might well everything original Wuhan version. Good thing lots countries want sweet vaccine

*looks Canada* seems nasty variants evaded vaccine antibodies share common mutations (although know much Indian one).

This good thing, since indicates there's limited amount virus evade immunity still remaining highly infectious. vaccine introduce viral infection body, reaction simply body’s immune system firing extreme.

Since cells damaged virus, illness present, can’t possibly portent body’s actual response virus! appointment canceled J&amp;J, it'll probably another month get jabbed, waiting lists area (central coast CA) ridiculous. Everyone 16 mean. double even though last post obvious back peddle, drunk driving analogy still holds. something obviously dangerous bad things haven’t happened *yet* mean bad things won’t happen keep tempting fate. Desantis? done masterful job sense word. state better despite him...literally. Mainly lied ass everything make worse yet people *shockingly* ignored him, distanced, wore masks getting vaccine anyway...where exactly make better? politicized got people killed tries hide bad was.

Your lazy attempts rewriting facts nothing disingenuous, partisan, political bullshit would nice included positivity rate. Might idea (may even dare call "" reality"") pandemic (in America) ending something gets ton airtime. highly polarized sensationalist media landscape, outlets taking one two stances: 
 
* COVID-19 never huge deal first place restrictions come ulterior motives 
 
* pandemic nowhere near variants also kids can't get vaccinated yet many anti-vaxxers also vaccines actually work and... 
 
If either ""reality"", questions pose pertinent. unfortunately, Americans particularly tuned beyond cable news Facebook posts, ""realities"" people living in. Yeah Modena giving dose least two times needed. Honestly - everyone know impacted side effects Moderna. second dose seems really wipe people out.  younger age - worse wipe out. clinic constantly 1-5 shows day. scramble call people come don’t waste doses. 

It’s absolutely worth calling local smaller clinics asking call cancellations. definitely loud body feels happening front them, happening. happening front them, one one care about. When’s last time hospitals overwhelmed flu cases? Also possible please look Covaxin (pushed government country). dog lover - Yes please!!! Mixed feelings comment. country hiring training enough healthcare professionals get worse. also means mid May, American adults fully vaccinated. Deaths going *plummet.* think we'll weekly average 500 then, honestly, might even say double digit average June possible. Doesn’t Pfizer give like 50% first dose? unfortunate truth open country is, reputation damaged people know bad things happening there.

Actual authoritarian states (despite reddit thinks, Bolsonaro Trump exact opposite: they're hands-off libertarians) much better-looking numbers lie threaten/control media. someone got J&amp;J 4 weeks ago, guess I’m one 999,999:1,000,000. Worst side effect subtle headache. 

Please consider actual risks educated conversations friends family scared pause. should’ve scared *didn’t* pause assess risks like this. Maybe would prefer inactivated virus vs. experimental mRNA? would take j j eveeeeerywhere NJ completely booked. US many people seeking J&amp;J vaccine since it’s one done.

And reputation fewer make take day work side effects. crazy think pandemic started bit year ago already 12% entire population Earth vaccinated. corporate governance alone. adhere Christian rhetoric, anti-anything long garners votes keeps power hands corporations. Prove wrong. problem kids parties . fact I'm forced sit office bunch people different households 8 hours virus avoids offices like plague everything that's work form associated fun prohibited . wonder nobody following rules anymore (if actually know rules also change time ) find pretty ridiculous continue restricting life fully vaccinated, least one many areas country virus relatively control (the current slight national increase pretty narrowly limited handful problem areas). 

In state, 10 daily infections per 100k people. given time, little hundred people hundred thousand active covid (very rough estimate based ~2 week infectious period). people going feeling sick staying home. I've got probably worse thousand one odds person encounter currently infected. encounter active case, there's guarantee I'll actually catch (since automatically catch covid encountering it, even close). would catch it, well I'm fully vaccinated, that's 90+% reduced chance I'll infected situation. get infected, new findings showing viral load 75% reduced, giving 90+% reduced chance infecting anyone else it. would infect someone else it, might (or think far say point state, *should*) vaccinated well, giving 90% reduced chance catching me. 

And even hugely unlikely events occur row actually manage infect another person coronavirus... there's still huge probably they're asymptomatic, least severe case. mean, point odds actually hurting someone via covid microscopically low longer worth altering life for? far I'm concerned, passed point several powers 10 ago. Alaska offering free vaccinations tourists.

Get 2nd dose tomorrow morning long resentment towards J&amp;J last?

Walking first step, it’s do, plenty don’t even much, that’s issue.

You might see it, go theme park it’s 8 hours wondering wife going save first time years they’ve active body can’t keep up.

If exercise you’ll less inflammation, body types strong trend physical activity though, overweight still issue even active.

You continue try play PC game, COVID DOESNT CARE PERSON OVERWEIGHT DOESNT WORK OUT.

We’ve given decades compassion support, it’s time personal responsibility.

Cause again, COVID19 DOESNT CARE PC, pretending big bones bad thyroid tough life helpful, already said plenty reasons someone can’t work out, trying take blame aren’t anything.

But that’s them, change needed them. take little roadtrip? looks like plenty available me: You’re either lying misinformed. Covid bills helped Americans. got second Pfizer vaccine hour ago mean, doctors honestly probably pay income taxes almost profession.


Not rich we're truly *wealthy* able live investments/generational wealth, still rich enough highest tax bracket, probably working highest # average hours bracket. mention student loan payments tax deductible also pay tens thousands malpractice licensure fees. 


Where grew up, teachers made per hour non surgeon doctors. Granted, lived place average teacher made 120k, bit outlier. 


In 80s, doctors used able work hard still earn enough drive around Benz. Now, doctors Hondas/Toyotas solidly upper middle class, still taking home probably lowest % paycheck major professions. make 170k pediatrician (average salary area, get age 32-34 completing residency/fellowship), might get take home 80k that. Seems unfair training sacrifice.


Also, consider make less minimum wage, idk pay taxes anyone else. people want make much do, literally work many hours do. well friend!

Interestingly, reaction COVID vaccine significantly milder get flu shot.   Read comment again. someone fully vaccinated COVID, odds COVID fucking life greatly reduced. Even vaccines manage reduce COVID infection severity cold, mission accomplished. People aren’t dying lives ruined anymore.

No one said Fauci reliable source. Unless sex worker Vancouver  RKI recommend Covid vaccines pregnant people enough data yet.


Guess depends country standards health organization uses.  come people ""they believe"". main person listen got shot secret sometimes find Fauci's comments negative divisive. smart but, like people, guilty making COVID political times unfortunate. Fauci served advisor every president since Reagan would prefer remained nonpartisan messaging.  mods allow post bs stuff? Seriously, like asking thermometer tell time getting mad keeps responding 74 degrees. Attributing vaccines creation speed developed trump administration make sense. Warp speed essentially pre-order vaccines. Trumps claims vaccine downright false.  looks like cases plateauing Brazil big relief.  That's true, understandable. feel instead pushed cloth masks time alternatives. Eventually got around point, right away mistake, think. developers vaccine part Jenner Institute. contributed paper links. also understand let people choose food. could solve obesity crisis letting government dictate diets. Joe Smith, nutritionist, think knows better food people gone school worked decades? think hindsight worth short term risk mask run. Fauci lying set motion many long term effects still dealing today. disturbing people full ignorance they'll ignore science politics. Getting things back normal happen enough people received vaccine. 

Define ""enough people."" get online. traveled 8 times country since March 2020. give aneurysm? way around. countries received vaccines 1st received emergency approval governing body bypassed normal acceptence guidelines. NZ, example, purchase agreements place 4 different manufacters pretty much time everyone else given situation able use Medsafe's normal appeoval process luxury also seeing real world results countries. result, NZ able choose go exclusively Pfizer.  known beginning supply always problem it'll get better Q2. relatives 60+, they're prio3, 22 mln people first two prio groups received merely supply 25 mln doses far. pretty logical 60+ wait enough supply there. Even prio3 almost 15 mln people means we'll hear continuous complains millions supply cover 4-5 millions week. 

As published we'll receive 58 mln doses Q2 BNT + Moderna. vaccination ramping Easter. doomsay original OP implied, neither wait end year forever! true! wife fully vaxxed utilize astral projection weekly commune spirits planes. Admittedly adjust ritual rearranging crystals swapping couple salt pillars new ones it’s issue all!

Now want talk REAL effects vaccine reasons get you’ll get argument regarding absolute antagonism we’ve receive koi fish since became fully vaxxed. far understand it, vaccine dilate third eye koi fish absolutely HATE it. We’ve stop stealing neighbors pond it’s worth guess. public wants return normal life without masks they're vaccinated, messaging lifting masks mandates restrictions happen time soon.

Sports universities seem still require masks even want proof fans students vaccinated. dunno, one trying normalize mask wearing. shots Moderna tore pretty bad. Migraine, fatigue, achy, second shot pretty bad chills. However, I’m glad able get  Fauci offers possibility life without suffering sickness virus! accept it, want life?

Is Fauci kind supernatural being? Trump said everyone would eligible vaccine April.

Here April everyone eligible. see reason believe would different Trump still President. Awesome This... put smile face. UK planned lift restrictions June 21st. German government enacting laws allow continue lockdowns June 30th. failure incompetence government criminal stabilization limits Brazil's ability test cases report deaths, spread virus actually stabilized.  comment linking brandnewtube.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  I've gotten first dose, second dose next week, 100% agree this. I'm increasingly skeptical people still hang every word Fauci says. Quite opposite. That’s partially it’s political antagonize people “opposite side” Natural immunity coronavirus fortunately quite strong. vast majority people infected produce ample antibodies immune cells fight infection.

The real upside getting vaccine another standardized boost immunity. Though statistically speaking almost surely immune years assuming get slightest infections (incredibly uncommon). Everybody really wants Fauci imagine finish line magic end date everything normal also right second Well, /r/Coronavirus, title could still clarified bit more. No, think vaccine would rolled planned, did. would suddenly change everything? DC been...not great. eligibility list since beginning March nothing. Decided pursue options waiting around DC give call! (where verbally attacked ultra-conservative)

He attacked refused answer basic question metrics need hit regards cases vaccinations start easing restrictions. Either clue plan, he's enjoying dragging out. even thinking treatments covid

Not true. monoclonal antibody treatments quite effective. know 5 high risk (diabetes, cancer survivors, heart conditions, etc), elderly people gotten it, made minor symptoms, including MIL, opposed FIL nearly high risk, died January.  really hard question answer.

Sinopharm probably worst vaccine bunch. works fairly well OG strain Covid isn’t working well variants. Still, even Brazil variant appears worst— 50% chance preventing symptomatic Covid 80% chance reducing severe infection death. That’s good flu shot. entire world got that, we’d pretty good state. *worst* part long takes become effective. shots work one dose— AZ, Pfizer, Moderna, give strong protection two weeks one dose. doesn’t look like Sinopharm works first dose, according Chilean data published... really need act like aren’t vaccinated two weeks second dose. 

Sputnik things get complicated. believe one single study published, ludicrously high efficacy rate— higher even mRNA varieties. likely primarily OG UK strains it’s still unbelievably good. issue BELIEVE study... cause comes Russia. state run organization. Chinese vaccine several countries studied published results. know Chinese vaccine works, independent studies. know Russian vaccine works people make it. 

Personally, think Russia’s vaccine works, first shot verrrry close J&amp;j’s vaccine works (which makes sense since AZ J&amp;J supposedly hit hard hackers vaccine process) it’s entirely possible Russian scientists really perfected second shot make much effective. unknown risks Russia’s vaccine anyone else.

Sorry didn’t really make decision easier, maybe information, come firm conclusion. Cash incentive. $20 bill receiving vaccine, handed recipient immediately injection. Thank God people like charge, then. logical individual level, population level it'll slow vaccination efforts, increase variants, etc.

I'd say unless US, boatloads good stuff, take whatever get help effort. wants see world burn. really doubt remotely supply meet demand. I’m asking confidently stated fact. link source. Also don’t psychiatrist, never have. Please. Somehow canada managed negotiate additional doses bottom list too. reality really important. Everyone locked island. could stay like years problem 😂 also admit comments like intensely controversial

That whole exchange Jim Jordan feel massively negative vaccination effort. Jordan merely asked quantifiable metrics indicate restrictions lifted Fauci kept smugly chuckling saying less, ""when say so.""

So we've got leader crisis refusing put numbers lifting restrictions also saying vaccinated people still restrictions unvaccinated. Well then, get vaccinated? There's increase liberty goal hit get back normal. I’m notorious fainting shots, absolutely despise needles.... hate covid signed soon could, didn’t faint either covid vaccines though! it’s liberty, it’s public personal health...period. doesn’t work. least sustainable enough doesn’t rise back soon it’s lifted, what’s exact point? Evil. 

Please see figure 7. Flu season often persists May really flattening June. country music fan, lol. Accepted sure, Canada (Ontario specifically) commonly spouted media/political narrative third wave due variants Premier easing restrictions early. actuality quite common Canada third wave respiratory infections March-May, places even B117 became dominant major surge infection. actually said differently meeting. reviewed thrombosis thrombocytopenia cases yet, process (only J&amp;J, said examining Pfizer Moderna time)

The UK guidance suspect VIPT/VITT patients thrombosis thrombocytopenia regardless vaccine received. seems safety monitoring must indicated could happen vaccines well. got Pfizer vaccine, auto-scheduled follow up, 28 days later. weird. Again, **I want mandate longer needed**. hope people health concerns freely wear want future. numbskulls probably mess up. need less divisive language positivity promotion around vaccination. 

Are including Fauci's quote talk divisive language, find statement pretty divisive.  gives impression anyone experiencing serious symptoms post-vaccine developing strong immunity. Really, whether experience serious symptoms following vaccine difference body responds, level immunity developing. said, I'd bit nervous experience sore shoulder. one common.  got home it. Currently slight headache. Unsure related. Getting mine next Tuesday, easy find schedule Pennsylvania doom predictions always one month away, huh? sounds like Rapture nuts. ""At end April, children die."" even get timing from? Moderna 1st shot wrecked weekend felt like fever, without actual temp. Headaches, chills, very, thirsty. exhausting say that. That's rhetoric since beginning. One reach ""herd immunity"" go back normal... defined herd immunity 80% population beginning. 

So 80% population vaccinated goal months. can't say certain state state however. National goal. know interstate travel unavoidable. need enough people get vaccinated go back normal, people refuse we're back normal yet never get there. self-sabotage. one CNN talking article. fine. 

That's works. terribly, they're alone. U.S. Britain giant shitshows politics, managed much better. Still good Israelis, seem ones actually got shit together. Yes, they're small country, percentage basis got things done amazingly fast, organized compared pretty much everyone else.

This first time I've come across someone denial strict/long lockdown been. I’m excited guys. Still ways agree, businesses mandate vaccine. hope do, think we're going need it.

Which makes total sense think it. infections actually make past vaccine, infections much weaker, less dangerous less likely kill you. getting downgraded across board enhanced immune system, makes sense we'd see asymptomatic infection- weakest outcome covid.

Yes, *you* fine. spread *others*. Like children vaccinated yet.

I'm continually astounded regards gets downvoted around here. Okay actually adjusting behavior based opinions people see getting interviewed news, rather quantitative risk assessment. accuracy infections generally know unless comparison last calendar period compare changes. think much bigger motive avoiding vaccine people realize.

Exactly, we're missing important parts human connection language. hell hearing impaired. imagine deaf year? Imagine anger everyone kept case. would like nearly silent world blind person. ok feel weird! comfortable yet, keep taking care wearing mask crowded places public transport. still dont know may happen weeks mask requirement cases still low, thats sign everything actuallly better! really depends trial they’re looking for. strict inclusion/exclusion criteria patients meet, they’re written patient safety data easier interpret later. 

If you’re signing “healthy volunteer” (basically control group doesn’t get kind medication treatment) you’re unlikely hear back tons people happy group. 

If you’re signing specific disease disorder medication procedure trials, like said, may good fit moment terms eligibility. 

Check ResearchMatch StudySearch. type disease interest see trials near currently recruiting. 
If big university medical center near you, check clinical trials pages call disease group ask put touch research coordinator group (ie hypertension ask cardiology research coordinator multiple sclerosis, ask immunology group research coordinator). get touch let know suffer x want know trials x. fuck subject hand? trying accomplish? Learn debate like adult. friend who's normally pretty rational thinker hesitant take vaccine people going bad affected it. say experience fear real regarding these, people irrational fear needles begin saying they're gonna get stuck 100% pain following day overshadow benefits getting vaccination.

I've even gone experience little me; first shot felt like small bruise arm, second shot aches chills 8 hours nothing bad, really much change mind 5 people talking badly got knocked ""dreaded second dose."" 

It's ridiculous baby gloves need times everyone regards vaccinations even people would expect little better might irrational fear they're always looking ways justify.

As theory, think way overthinking that. everything's facebook conspiracy level thing, basic people basic fears, form pain often one them. need handled bit gently, told everything's alright, given lollipop afterwards like kid they're sure come back future vaccinations boosters. Nice! I’m kinda nervous I’ve passed doctors offices patient centers past. real reason either time, happens. Still gonna show Wednesday hope best lol hope pass it’s get shot want something hastily studied produced pumped body. want know many people vaccines shitting us want anti vaxers 🤣 thank you. ""hurr durr religion bad""

Go back r/atheism Yeah, several headlines, including one CBS, changed way supports theory. Getting second days you. TBH way emotional moment would thought. last year plus shitshow think summer might within shouting distance normal feels weird.

Not planning *anything* late June/early July jic, &amp; beyond minimum 2 week wait full effect. Still, thinking makes want super careful fuck things up. guns Biden wants outlaw already banned recently 90s. 
Solutions red flag laws, universal background checks, 3 day waiting periods, training/licensure would address mass shootings suicides domestics. 
Sorry hurts feelings. Lmfao fr   I'm vaccinated. wish old enough eligible yet. problem refusing everyone 55 remains unvaccinated may true many people, certainly true all. Also, even others take masks off, still keep mine relative says wants see long term affects vaccination. 🙄 long term effect American public knows CDC willing lie feel appropriate. tell us ""trust plan"" ""do we're told"" they're organization that's knowingly lied without much apology? God term “crotch goblin” cringe. Stop trying edgy call baby fuck’s sake look various simulations herd immunity , quick drop infections get 60% plummets get 70-80% herd immunity. information Israel comparison U.S. makes sense.

Never felt drowsiness bullshit before. 1 dose hand falls off. That’s great bingo! agree think it’s long overdue update it. It’s causing vaccine hesitancy, guarantee it. Emojis make credible here. might extremist websites dumb here. second option sounds good me. every time say won’t able open kids, get downvoted. go folx. messaging already getting people think covid isn’t safe kids, y’all really still think “omg summer normal! july 4th! fall!” sir. lockdowns stay Almost certainly not. would say no, may weird it, knows.

Did match manufacturers last two flu vaccines? government told people kiss baby, they'd punch baby's face principle, gloat patriotic are. know, US best quality healthcare world....if afford it. average joe runs America need find medical treatments. first dose Moderna vaccine made tired hot. never thought take temp woke night shirt damp. day 2 back normal, sore arm. I’ll ready dose two tho, might take following day work kid starts vaccination side effects, good indication got real thing.

But really want know, go get antibody test. Probably everywhere. lots sites Ohio little demand shots.  Demand way infections way up. Probably reached 56% vaccinated. they’ve already said vaccines need readministered six months. herd immunity isn’t reached then, it’s stupid people didn’t get vaccine. thus thy cycle continue. continue keep blaming democrats. know people say early know medium long term side-affects want risk it. people agree blood clot issue non-issue, given rare is, influence thinking, still think know enough right now. people various personal timelines ""okay"" get ranging 6 months 2 years they're satisfied safety. Crazy UK US incompetent countries pandemic best vaccination rates currently. used vast resources earlier time. know one strong reactions both, son's therapist. first laid nearly week, second described bad ""it made first dose seem like gave friendly hug instead vaccine."" that, same, know gotten 2 shots. Wait longer rather getting soon. 42 days/six weeks doses. another week increased availability near you. suspect mostly isolated long periods time also make fearful would otherwise be. found shocking it’s sudden feel “dilutes purpose alert” idk think using makes sense. able reach everyone Virginia link sign up. don’t follow news don’t read reddit think it’s possible realize eligible Check study posted below. Again, small sample size, implies moderna Pfizer produce similar t-cell responses. agree frustrating almost nobody, including moderna themselves, seem saying much anything Moderna t-cells. guess fortunate. know one died Covid hospitalized Covid.  directly know 27 people got Covid, none ended hospital. 

If vaccine doesn’t convince person protected go terrible understanding post-vaccination risk assessment. ""12"" 1️⃣3️⃣ believe vaccine right you? Walgreens filled mine wrong 2nd shot pfizer knocked wife ass 24hrs, sore arm, fatigue headache. I'm scheduled second Pfizer dose Saturday (2 hour drive away), there's availability get 2 days early facility 5 minutes home. CDC says 4 days early OK, anyone else received early second dose? SARS, MERS, COVID-19. clear Coronaviruses particular pose significant threat, good avenue pursue.

But evolution good is, still prepared respond much quickly something else inevitably breaks out, either vaccine-breaking coronavirus another family entirely. Getting vaccines approved year truly ""warp speed"" compared status quo, need get response time months, even weeks. 

That require medical regulators consciously accept risk times crisis, politicians remind people soldiers side, soldiers take risks protect other. it’s one time notification bad?  got 2nd pfizer Saturday, yesterday absolutely miserable. Headache, chills, every part body hurt achy kind pain. sit still everything hurt uncomfortable district tells self report Health Department effective tracing program due rise cases. Got 2nd Pfizer today. Mayo primary care provider goddamn machine whole process. 10 minutes shots. still hard reach. live family care? 

But free even administer cost free. time someone living deep forest grandparents cant leave extreme example. probably fixable issues also. adult never leaves house health issues bad health care setup home, exposing chronic care issues???- Moderna coming booster vaccine. Pfizer. two vaccines Moderna.

When booster vaccine comes out, get booster manufacturer one gave first two COVID injections? me, first shot stop drinking craving water? edgy. product tainted pause continues United States.  countries rejecting like AstraZeneca shunned would anyone fence vaccine choose get vaccinated life change post vaccine? We're getting point everyone wants one vaccinated, need give people reason take shot... dropping someone got invitation don’t know things done states fairy tale people downvoting live, Berlin Brandenburg absolute mess. It’s actually extremely common wealthy people around world travel US healthcare. place check go 5 days appointments always full.

Checked tons places since state started March 30th open all. Haven’t able get spot. last year we've used getting whatever want within week wanting it. Supply limitations something think well. far nothing indicates Pfizer vaccine increases risk blood clots all, given many administered across North America Europe, one would expected see something now. 

The symptoms VITT J&amp;J AZ seem develop 5-14 days vaccination. Nah dont read articles. make opinions Evidence shows vaccinated also significantly reduces transmitting Covid. hope you’re taking precautions infect anyone might worse odds yourself.  Tomorrow #1. 5-6 weeks maybe see family? I'm waiting fully approved FDA can't wait day people actually read latest research stop saying spread easily vaccination. Again, akready 50%. 70% intend get vaccinated. ""the south"" alarge area, Available appointments mean every place weak demand. really think soon open appointments immediately end? new people Bauhau vaccinated? would shocked adult valuation rate leadt get 65%. sound insensitive, butso many one region unvaccinated might good. regions higher rates get control, region state sees summer surge, purple might wake get caffeinated. 

There way millions purple get caffeinated compared now. That's fine. take risk, keep restrictions cause people refuse get vaccine. truly available everyone wants one, see reason keep restrictions. percentages don’t mean much ages haven’t equal access vaccines.

It makes sense 75+ 70% access vaccine Decemeber/January, &lt;30 crowd *just now* getting opportunity.

I’m sure told &lt;30 crowd Juanary could get vaccine first return normal sooner would lines miles long. ""Israel"" 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😅😅😅😅😅😅 Poggers work mandated vaccinations Aug 1st, medical exceptions only. explanation - private vaccinations 'protected' class. Question: live US recently recovered covid (less month ago), get vaccine, waiting period get it? Previously heard number 90 days thrown around, never found sources reasons that. prioritize people without antibodies? medical reason either work worse health? really think main purpose vaccine protect people, yourself?

Yes, that's EXACTLY purpose vaccine healthy likely fight underlying virus. really fucking stupid? feel like we've shattered reasonable vaccination projections january. got shot saw post nextdoor drive thru clinic 20 minutes away. wasn’t drive 2 hours twice get vaccinated something negligible threat me. I'm waiting 'til finals. feel stressed want risk day sniffles minor fever.(I'm fl, i've able weeks now) Come friday I'll get jabbed first available needle. that's weird cause listen 14 months guys bragging well handle covid think it’s lot less politics messaging can’t do. Yeah mean re: indoor gatherings shortens time people gather indoors thus probably results crowding less. instituted one liquor stores close hour~ early, make stores crowded like 9 known medical allergies sit observed thirty minutes. New Delhi beaches?? would train wreck like presidency Falsifying CDC logo offense here, actually fairly serious crime. Big bad pfizer going get you. escape, start running. probably hopeless, get chance maybe frame question: think getting vaccinated scarier getting COVID-19? 

- unknown long term consequences COVID-19.

- *Many* people hurt disease vaccine 200 million doses administered U.S. Maybe give people actual finish line get covid, even feel ok, still letting spread mutate. year sucked lot people lot different ways. know I'm internet stranger, please part make world less shitty. Please get vaccinated. biggest thing fact vaccine companies legal immunity regarding effects vaccine may have. recourse something happen you, even rare. can’t imagine going crowded place long, long time. There's natural ebb flow things. Vaccines + Natural immunity prior infection + people naturally careful personally know bunch people it.   “Wait. mean can’t....we can’t fuck street?” It’s fraud, it’s medical form. select option even check zip code appts. I’m almost positive it’s oversight system it’s keeping eligible people receiving appts. Wish brother law wife would get vaccinated. Herd immunity turns 90% effectiveness 99% effectiveness. Can't catch it. article said deaths spiking younger cases, leads believe hospitalizations virus affecting younger people severely, rather room hospital, they're sent home bottle Dimetapp. cases actually widespread severe, deaths would increase.  see FEMA place something vaccinating area in, try calling asking. Sometimes enough people coming take advantage want vaccinate people, might happy take someone in. Might well, vaccinated better are. haven’t done yet? Many states also allow new appointments 12:00 (at night). studied segment long Covid, studies finding similar rates Long COVID people minor illness. still needs studied hopeful breakthrough cases cause Long Covid. Oh I'm - fomite transmission never real risk virus, vaccination? Really issue.   think likely we're carrying too, I'd rather safe sorry seems like we're close - trip finish line wear another 1-2 mos everyone gets vaccinated That’s awesome. looks like they’re basically plateau right seeing cases come day pattern follows Israel’s They're going work anything serious, like booking cruise. They're going want see V-Safe account something similar. worry reasoning used smoker felt like bullshit, one gives shit slightest, long info matches ID stab you. willing get vaccinated, it. staying home sick luxury unfortunately  Exactly. eligible since 3/15 state, realize 4/1 shitty doctors realize it, get like 4/10 packed, FEMA place giving everyone.

It's going hard find appointment people month. substantially smaller population eligible, literally trying vaccinate like everyone fucking country. going take while. He's looking you, MSNBC, CNBC, CNN, Faux, Yes new strain India wasn’t anything protect either. election rallies, religious places open full capacity not.
I sure people surprised, government obviously gonna take blame mishandling blaming new variant. risk putting people know better harm's way seems bit disingenuous.

It's partly reporting anomaly, weekends happen every week. 

It's still lowest death figure since September, matter what. 40% drop 2020 1000 * 0.6=600, 60 % growth 2021 600*1.6 =960 4.16% drop compared last year. Even couple hours away? Cause need drive twice. got stabbed moderna sunday :) don’t want forced use bing /s. Wow cant believe uncle wanted get it. say somebody believe vaccine right me. Yup. I'm 26 first AZ shot begining march. Absolutely worries blood clot. awful side effects (immune response) I'd sooner side effects day lose sense smell taste, let alone thousands lives saved. one first wear them, too, I’m getting anxious drop them. June 1 I’ll ready rebel places aren’t dropping mandates go daily life. Yes, I’m ready disappointed I'm fence. I've voted oblivion trying make reasonable explanation severall times goes again:

I'm going assume covid point time, although never tested positive. stopped getting tested long said get get it. sick couple times throughout year nothing major. Def flu like symptoms. So. said. Heres based know. 

Covid hard get second time less dangerous cases. obviously true 100% time seems reasonable popular opinion. already it, ddn't affect much, would get vaccinated?

Also, vaccine already calling booster, recently Phizer announced people likely need 2nd booster year later. So, vaccine sense like Polio? yearly shot like flu might might help? something know enough? 

If know enough, I'd rather trial run vaccine. conspiracy, concern. dont think 5g laser Bill Gates mind control chips going downloaded blood stream. also personally fully vaccinated (until covid), family. fully believe concerned covid vaccine make anti vaxer. still, one answered questions concerns. 

Also, vaccine becomes required travel, goto live events, etc. ill get it. case one friend mine, boss said, ""No one permitted return office unless they're vaccinated."" likes WFH. constantly F5 potentially drive 2 hours available lol. many hoops time requirements get shot. isn’t going weeks. feel like policy was, docking PTO, way worse.

It gives way incentive go work sick, infect around you, cause efficiency go way down.

I understand businesses think better get one extra worker couple days lose 5 coworkers couple days. short-sighted policy get people come work sick.

And good luck keeping sick workers' productivity up. feel like shit, work like shit. seem abuse it, could probably policy needing doctor's note point. Dude, 2 hours? like 30min. even free picture station set took really awkward picture. Herd immunity June 1 let’s fucking GO informative. Thank that. Sorry, see flair mobile, never would tried debate knew specialist. changed view. Yup, mild headache day 2 sore arm. Felt hot times day, chills night, nothing haven’t felt flu shot. Day 3 woke felt great  cool. that? people come go find them? Sucks 🤷‍♂️ spent time walking car actual appointment took. pretty nice.  mean, last 3 people replying arguing availability problem. trying help get vaccine. mean I’m lucky don’t get sick really ever haven’t factor in, I’ve never even job vacation time sick days job started little ago, schedule two days back back four days row type vacations family gatherings need attend, drive Long Island back like one day something. lucky. unlucky. I'm person know dozens felt bad I'm starting feel better. 48 hours feeling like crap getting protected/helping protect family allows visit family friends worth it. forget anti vaxxers passing around one another still contributes herd immunity. Obviously desired reach herd immunity whether everyone gets vaccinated not. open appointments sooner? signed mass vax site could get appointments starting 2 days future. imagine people taking scheduling week out. one testing asymptomatic spread - highly likely children.  4th however could Virginia pushed alert notification everyone’s phone vaccines opening 16+ wow reactions divided choice Same, compared first. Also mild fever hours headache. ""I also took 2 tylenol got home shot, 2 bed, 2 next morning, try head symptoms ahead time.""

If somebody responsibility would say “we take masks X% adult Americans fully vaccinated”, wouldn’t much fear uncertainty anger currently experiencing. 

Most people don’t panic know plan is, even plan terrible. panic think plan doesn’t exist, don’t know plan is. 

I hope we’ve learned lesson importance crisis communication next major disaster strikes. Lol slightly sore arm, hours 2nd shot haha   Yeah forget people love talk eat popcorn watching) annoying movie patrons Yes, definitely experienced this. specifically oranges anything orange-flavored. Orange juice suddenly tasted like Windex anything artificially flavored tasted extremely weird. can’t stand junk food anymore guess that’s nice. Outside fairly safe, think. crazy behavior US proven theory anecdotally even scientifically.

Between protests, riots, insurrections FL spring breakers we've good look results stick outdoors good weather probably alright.

What's mask situation now? Good trying spread awareness, vaccines lost one use true tragedy.  Yes, are. transited Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China (People's Rep.), Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Ireland (Rep.), Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland United Kingdom (excluding overseas territories outside Europe), past 14 days allowed enter transit.

It apply US citizens permanent residents tough, likely ""tourists"" case. Even though vaccine available,all appointments ""sold out"".i looking forever always like :/   expect New Yorkers drop mask mandates public? far I'm aware Moderna yes. genuinely worried, look official information side-effects contact doctor. I’m currently 24 hours post second moderna dose. I’d compare mild-moderate hangover far. Maybe slightly worse first shot. Also Covid. would definitely choose Covid again, day. Yeah kept asking defined strict lockdown period classifying strict long. Rather answer point went comparisons countries rather actually answering point.

Knowing don’t even read replies though, I’m out. incredibly hypochondriacal. You’re going far line you’re actually horse shoe-ing way inadvertently becoming anti vaxxer doubting efficacy vaccines MUCH pandemic. 

There literally nothing wrong vaccinated person going social gathering without wearing mask. Vaccines work. great thing keep masking such, odds catching covid exposed start declining 10 days first dose second dose, second dose boosts bit.

So, CDC wants us wait consider fully vaxxed 2 weeks second, start breathing easier 2-3 weeks first. I, personally, liked counting immunity milestones waiting second dose.  People truly fascinating**ly hypocritical, idiotic** creatures.

FTFY  Eh get it. think honest. lot people like things easy. That's states automatically register people vote make people opt organ donations. much easier get people something make easy. want hire lawyer sue companies mandatory meetings. LoL
What bunch idiots imagine would date it. Based rule, he'd likely show boss *some* point staying WFH longer option anybody office. time, boss sees early vaccination date, imagine might upset.  CDC taking long update vaccine tracker? last week consistently updated 1:30 PM EST, week didn’t update evening every single day. inconsistency? Ah oops missed lol ""very low""? many cases? That's person responding looking - generic ""when risk low"" ""when cases low"" ""when safe"" etc. Thanks correction! seeing data myself, info 2 studies mentioned (hence running advice 2 studies limited participants really alarming). I'll definitely look forward whatever find her. links share would really appreciate it. 

And agree, otherwise healthy I'll let decide feels side effects. I'm still somewhat partial sinopharm, work home 2 wks wait second dose effectiveness affect all, case her. 

And really need thank me, completely selfish choice end protect happens unselfish side effect protecting others. Tbh people probably think way means they'll get vaccinated Can't tell sarcastic What? Oh bet ex-politician you’d follow hell back told get it.  can. stay garden I’m American. sure that’s saying not. splitting hairs. general public doesn’t give fuck this, especially means conservative politicians.

Again, material win fighting board regents university’s point view? It’s shitty situation, actually deconstructing what’s going on, perspective take talking universities approaching fall semester.

I hope I’m wrong, morally right thing prevail political context. hasn’t case entire pandemic, don’t expect change now. forgot Dre Good. Maybe time guys finally remove export ban?? make sense me. He's categorizing people based voted pointing finger one side. That's incredibly divineness. means people voted current admin reason resent people voted ex-admin.  could find vaccine 😩 bunch places check ID, especially smaller cities. want vaccinate much possible. 

The big mass vaccination centers want match name id passport work fine. scan check visa anything US EU citizens need visa travel Brazil. I'm sure there'll least 1 Lucky you! I'm least bit swayed needles anything. dam, one real pinch! Worse novacane face cavity. least terms pain. one, worst shot got canine tooth, like nose. wierd one lol. barley hurt. really uncomfortable. Covid shot felt like stabbed. Plenty people contribute divineness country Fauci one particular quote.

Fauci doctor, need single people based political affiliation. Ah yes, course semantics, pointing literally said he’s uninformed... 

Also I’m maybe that’s difference. I’ve taking advantage easing restrictions haven’t felt it’s strict last 6 weeks, you’ve apparently unable leave house year.  *Religious exemptions* vaccine?! Get fuck outta that. final straw last shred respect organised religion growing up, relative mine named Jan Jansen immigrated Minnesota Sweden Norway mentioned often, forced go John Johnson. grew older almost certain family inside joke kind based tone name mentioned. recent debate mom Jansen must Norwegian Johnson Swedish Johansson, on-the-spot Google confirmed mostly incorrect. would anyone fence vaccine choose get vaccinated life change post vaccine? 

Because they’re decent human doesn’t want get sick get people around sick? almost seem... viscerally upset pandemic beginning end. cannot help ask why? 

Why lucky enough vaccine essentially 100% effective preventing severe cases covid. moderna’s trials, 30000 people received vaccine. *single person* developed severe case covid let alone died it. incredibly, incredibly powerful. 

And results reflected today. 78.5 million people vaccinated, 5800 infected, 74 people died. *78.5 million* 

I’m going pretend like vaccine isnt effective. want continue wearing masks, personal reason (ie brings comfort whatever), means it. point you’re going accept masks aren’t going become thing. People already stopped wearing them. thats fine. There’s nothing wrong wearing mask seeing vaccinated people. Vaccines work. Yea, guess different countries different standards. apologies pulling American assuming country's standard translates countries. Obviously health organization opinion this. really. Get back plane, spend 3 days hotel cost 2000$, 14 day home mandatory quarantine. Outside? sure hope not. people NY still time stop soon vaccinated. Moderna (the one got)? same? risk clots? fucks nonvaxers I’ll it! come CDC doses administered still updated 2 days? stuck 209m.  hope resigns doubt will. entire handling pandemic insult people Ontario. it’s approved anyone 16 up, entire collegiate demographic. 

No, isn’t *approved*. Emergency Use Authorization, different allows used without formal approval. said “fully approved,” weren’t talking age groups formal FDA approval didn’t ask. cursory google search long antibodies stay system seems answers this. really doubt hospitals pharmacies vaccinations mass vax sites. mass vax sites vaccinating LOT people, quickly. hope starting dwindle. Nope. happened twice like middle school. passed dermatologist two appointments row. nothing years sudden, passed visiting girlfriend post-op. blood, anything would make someone pass out. happened. 

And incidents I’ve doctors, gotten shots, needles, surgery times. passing last time get queezy thinking doctors office anything medical places. 

So yeah, reason don’t know except show shot hope best. hopefully don’t pass it’ll get head I’ll “cured” never said 'no idea'. entire extended family live Bolton (with one cousin London), know little bit. Specifically:

* Outdoor gatherings allowed limited six people.
* Mixing households allowed (unless one person 'bubble')
* Pubs opened week ago restricted outdoor gatherings only

I know Aunt able go across street hang neighbor since Nov/Dec. went first time last week even still hung backyard (despite fact four fully vaccinated).

There's lot know lockdown, said know specifics. understanding things listed true Nov/Dec week ago. could wrong, point still stands UK one longest/strictest lockdowns world. free name tons countries longer/stricter lockdowns try prove wrong. guess able name handful countries within Europe also long/strict. Imagine flaunting asshole.  One man instigated policy divisiveness politicized virus. Fortunately longer deal daily antics, although came close literally overseeing destruction democratic republic. 

The buck stops him. needs big helping personal responsibility. divisive people he's reffering disagree begin with. states stop asking all, would assumption. can't defend embargo; going use AZ doses blocking raw ingredient exports stupid. sooner dropped better. People keep saying this, seen anyone take lockdown seriously. 

As key worker, first lockdown drove empty highways work 8am. lockdown gone though, traffic 80-90% pre-pandemic levels throughout. Aside pubs, shops restaurants closed, British public ignored entirely. They're storage plant, fate still uncertain. CVST occurs general population rate around 5 per million. It’s low platelet combo issue. combo seen MRNA vaccines. big relief parents got vaccines well. knew efficient would mean them. slowly opening activities, think ""cautious"" better word describe ""fearful"". well-informed safe effective vaccines are, also lot data current slew variants react vaccines. Given rapidly variants surfaced original covid-19 virus appeared, also wary things data pool yet, new double-variants viruses. long-term efficacy vaccines also something lot data yet. Even Pfizer's CEO messaging adults may need 3rd shot end year, seasonal boosters may likely. good, rational reasons CDC still recommends vaccinated people wear masks remain socially distant public, epidemiological landscape COVID completely set stone. rapidly changing evolving, would unwise think ""Oh vaccine, thing gonna beat, I'm going fine rest life""

My MIL quite bit less informed, much fearful. vast majority 'news' comes stuff facebook posts. left-end political spectrum, imagine polar-opposite anti-masker: highly afraid, greatly overexaggerating risks catching covid, taking (IMO) unnecessary precautions name safety. suppose could worse, though. reason somewhat difficult MIL retired lives household. go life story, put mildly - easy live lol. everyone NY U.S. wearing masks entire year 2021? Dude speaking choir. conservative I’m dealing bullshit friends political leaning. Yea stupid it, actual public communication subject right atrocious. never specified Fauci. I'd take perspective seriously politicians competent Trump screwed way worse did. Angela Merkel fucked up, Trump deserves credit fucking up. Yes! I'm proud part group that's putting end this! ""It's piece mRNA, inherently unstable breaks body.""
You correct mRNA unstable buffer itself, stabilized another additive, case PEG. I'm sure conducted extensive studies (maybe now?) determine mRNA half life injected. Also, besides muscle cells (myocytes), else might vaccine traveling body? seems like big unknown right now. totally agree modified vaccines function exact way, knowing repeated boosters vaccine type may react body long term. probably fine, anyone know sure? true. Despite higher risk, today [some people objected vaccination I'm thankful might free disease today. us, think understand. People tried get rid trump twice, impossible get rid sitting president term l, even suck. got lucky term expired lol. sure county not. yeah, hopefully weeks things better. repost clickbait article 2 hrs ago?  That's talking development, testing/approval process. kind vaccine (mrna) development many years, think time line kind works out. know virus we'd need mrna vaccine year ago, we'd already working toward vaccine quite while. Two hours me! excellent point. they're refusing listen evidence, shaming hurt. seated theater longer usually restaurant, may something it. got second dose last week. Wife getting 2nd dose Saturday. Can't wait. last weeks, Michigan accounted around 10% U.S. cases. 7-day case peak 7,863 April 13, U.S. 71,222 day. subtract Michigan, would mostly steady. biggest concern 27% likely concentrated certain regions. doubt cities it'll 95+% uptake, &lt;50% rural areas. means covid could getting passed around rural communities long time US ought herd immunity. schedule public meeting go data

I wish urgency / transparency current status is. global pandemic, public guessing meeting scheduled Also delay second dose halve time needed protect vulnerable occurrences low platelets blood clots mRNA vaccines. point enough given enough time passed would shown data. Heparin standard care CVST blood clots kill patient low platelets, hence pause need spread info doctors viral vector vaccines.  I've run numbers guy saying I'm pretty sure he's right. looked yesterday took 5 minutes schedule CVS 1 mile apartment. Got today couple hours ago. Except vaccine rollout happening fast. Aren’t borders closed? fun video, really understand much breakthrough mRNA tech thinks ""miraculous tech"" got J&amp;J one shot instead two. No, thought one would enough (and is).  50% adults! That’s great news! imagine good place we’ll month mid May! So, Biden become good right promising delivering. good thing. He's making predictions numbers say easily achievable, everyone going knocking ballpark. Think 100m 100 days, doubling goal.

Originally goal ""every American wants get May 1st."" changed April 19th.

His goal small gatherings 4th July. yes, gonna possible enough people ""fully vaccinated"" time Memorial Day well.

But certain symbolism July 4th goal date course.

I'm still sad tho. June Pride Month Kickoff event optied safer route cancelled year. appreciate abundance caution, still quite sad. No, drinking kool-ade. Uh... okay? really bad someone who’s vaccinated wear mask. mean, wearing mask stop spread flu flu vaccine? course not. Hopefully see big drops next 2-4 weeks. done Australia NZ impressive aren’t essentially locked rest world get vaccinated? Like governors listening CDC recommendations anyways. live Florida, never statewide mask mandate. local jurisdictions implemented any. thank you. meant ask effectiveness month longer? would say low. California New York huge populations high vaccine demand. possible could walk rural areas, definitely Los Angeles New York City. also need advertise hard bring tourists; they're probably two visited states foreigners regardless. Alaska tough position low population relies heavily tourism (which primarily came cruises summer!)

Other states could potentially it, especially South. Georgia makes big advertising pushes low uptake. 190 cases low blood platelets clotting? It’s specific issues JnJ AZ.

Regular blood clots occur population rate 1 per 1,000. pretty common. Thanks! Ya Canada slow god.    think it’ll bit July point. Don’t panic! He's racist legit reasons go on. definitely, hope people thought implying. Georgia.  Millions become seriously ill, many sick long time.

Do actually reliable source millions seriously ill?

The long covid boogeyman anywhere near bad made be. Simple - say ""when 70% vaccinated, restrictions gone."" pick whatever number want. fewer people get vaccinated, it'll take longer get there, make harder say number. I’m Texas day got emergency alert cop shot 200 miles away me. wasn’t even killed. fuck supposed it? useless alert I’ve ever gotten phone went turned off, seemed like huge abuse system. 

Vaccine notifications seem like great use though. stopped trying pre-register/go state websites. went Walmart’s website scheduled appointment literally within minutes, vaccine within 36 hours. I’m even out-of-state work didn’t ask questions (Virginia). Go straight thru providers see works.  Trump track roll amount vaccines? know general attitude towards disease lackluster probably cost thousands lives terms vaccines even well? yeah Biden president earlier could've prevented countless deaths. Sure, let's revisit - I'll set calendar reminder. I'm pretty confident what's happen. We've basically exactly expected trajectory vaccination since started - we're little month behind Israel.

Around time last month, state things Israel 60% adults received least one shot. Hospitalizations cratered elderly, small spike among young people. Sound familiar?

Today, Israel almost fully reopened removed outdoor mask mandate, trajectory relax restrictions coming weeks.

The US month - vaccines really work. behind curve, encounter much vaccine hesitancy unexpectedly bad variant starts spread despite vaccines (possibly Brazilian P.1 variant, way British Columbia). I'm quite optimistic both.

Looking forward getting life savings! ;) Still better getting COVID. link still works me. screenshot anyways sure mean ""they"" posts still come sub regarding possible treatments covid-- there's lot chatter vaccines timely-- everyone thinking they're getting trying get it.

IIRC treatment, part issue easier prevent infection treat it. understanding treatment also works best administered early infection gets severe, too. challenge people without access good healthcare. makes think that’s abuse sick day? day allotted contract. cares actually use for??? citizen state live eligible? poster originally responded says they're ICU nurse, absolutely aware. divert couple nights row abnormal flu season big traumas (bad snowstorms, even).

But yeah, that's asked think norm - think 40%, informed. think ~70% actually is, big spikes winter pretty normal, they're intentionally trying make sound scarier is. expect actually answer, though. definitely clear Fauci said metric getting back normal 10,000 daily covid cases. Florida? true. 6% actually died Covid, probably far less. Yeah always people. people need finish line people fence people waiting. really changes perspective things. Prior getting vaccinated, entirely wearing masks social distancing got shots completely changed mindset (for myself).

Now tend try get vibe place deciding need mask not. respect private establishments rules make big deal I'm asked put mask always carry one anyway days panic wearing mask me. positive asymptomatic die suddenly 45 days later it.

I even understand trying say. People truly fascinating creatures (NZ) benefit (relatively) air tight border luxury measured rollout. dad pediatrician used pretty conservative.

It's stupid. vaccinated wear mask, vaccinated, wear mask stop spread also protection. That's message sent out.

We already plenty studies show wearing mask, already reducing risk getting COVID huge amount. vaccinated concerned, double mask up. vaccinated need. vaccinated concerned want wear mask, prepared get COVID hopefully learned lesson.

Yeah.. fuck-up behind schedule. 10am appointment became 12pm appointment.. Decided wait since already there, could re-scheduled. admitting vaccines sold as.  messaging vaccines terrible.  Many saying what’s point can’t get back normal sure downvoted. I'm virologist feel way. actually bought masks late 2019 flu going around department stuck hour-long meetings snuffly individuals. really enjoyed single cold respiratory illness past year. put mask wearing, hand hygeine, people staying home they're sick. Also in-person meetings think resume soon. 

Bottom line, feel safest doing. might get dirty looks strangers whatever, matter. Protect stay healthy! this? Half million storage Ontario AZ boomers didn’t want. Hopefully we’ll see shrink lowered age. No, mean immunocompromised patients usually asymptomatic. ones im talking admitted hospital usually dont make it. Normal people normal immune system asymptomatic, dont even know infected, let alone coming hospital. read comment? necessarily time takes get shot, 24-48hrs side affects leery. wait 2 weeks, harm - foul. No, people vastly different experiences... 

I know several people personally got second shot threw multiple days know others symptoms. Meanwhile part Germany: Still vaccinating 70+ year olds risk people only, lol. Saskatchewan age 48 currently. I'm vaccinated well, trust government sensible thing comes policies. I'm military go order late next month. fully vaccinated 40 days. still quarantine hotel room 2 weeks show up. government maintains nonsensical rules time, people work government see constantly. yeah, thankful right now. live grandma safer  even arguing this?

The UK indeed long strict lockdown. We've inside 4 months now, 2 lockdowns prior.

Sounds like promoting pro-lockdown agenda. Nonsensical arguethat 'uniformed claims'

Source: someone living UK Timonium Fairgrounds, I'm sure get Baltimore County resident. doubt there's way, went Baltimore County. Wow well done America Please go get vaccine Yeah longest part certainly sitting 15 minutes. time walked door sat wait 5 minutes. Various state governments started criticize central governments monopoly vaccines procurement distribution. So, central government essentially allowed states vaccinate 18+ ones able procure. 50% procured central government administered per current central guidelines. specific reason whatsoever federal rollout would better?

Do specific reason whatsoever federal rollout would worse?

I mean, best rollout earth far I'm aware... seems like good thing. Lol agreed you. question people vulnerable covid covid vaccine protecting others justify getting myself. Considering every one vaccines experimental FDA risk life protect stranger themselves. 

Don't get wrong believe vaccines always mine daughter comes unproven vaccine find questioning wether worth unknown risk family. next lowest age group authorized? next lowest age group? Yeah don’t get need time estimate. depends cases/hospitalizations that’s incredibly hard predict. Feeling lot better thanks. gave medicine nausea next day almost perfectly normal. caused strong reaction doctor said possible could've exposed stomach bug around time got shot, know works I'm okay good I’m reducing vaccine hesitancy vaccine untrustworthy least wildly inconsistent numbers really help that. easily available local pharmacy they’ll it.

They already though. went CVS last Tuesday get first jab took like 20 minutes total, initially signed online tons slots available area. can't imagine believing Trump plan whatsoever beyond making money possible shortest amount time &amp; cronies really. US gov't sitting 20+million AZ doses plans moving forward them.  It’s not, it’s B117. Cool. You’re getting point genius Bet republicans actually majority vaccinated point whenlooking age folks vaccinated People decide whether Chile’s larger study trustworthy not. It’s especially relevant Latin America’s vaccine rollout.

If study reduces vaccine hesitancy leverages people’s trust Chilean scientists so, that’s bad thing. spent years living China, married Chinese women, follow Chinese media speak Chinese. Chinese government trusted. research published shows effective vaccines two weeks?

Thanks prob people blame people california rising housing costs states instead corporations. website actually says ""not identified"" ""other"" probably missing information. website actually says ""not identified"" ""other"" probably missing information. Pfizer seeking approval 12-15 US elsewhere. happy everyone getting vaccine! Haven’t gotten yet I. correct. vaccine appointments NH handled one website (which surprisingly well-designed easy use). matter getting vaccine Walgreens, state-run site, anywhere else, sign website. means super convenient compare sites find place near available appointments. also really easy reschedule appointment appointment slots open up.

Add factors mentioned thread (size state, demographics, etc), efficient handling supply, high demand, relatively administrative bottlenecks. Yeah, much sucks, I'll take covid day Damn. first person I've heard go hospital due side effects. Could allergic reaction?

How feeling now? “... range results” prove it. You’ve provided literally proof whatsoever point.

“...Chile result outlier” don’t know result outlier. numbers demonstrate that. no, point made (again).

You clearly agenda push. seem invested n proving Sinovac vaccine trusted good traditional vaccine products. However fact numbers provided quite clearly show Sinovac results simply trustworthy. wild range really cannot trust accurate. Brazil’s, Chile’s anyone’s. That’s entire problem. cannot know certainly cannot trust Chinese government tell us. know nothing society's collapse. clinical trial. told blood clot case, happened shortly trial began. time, insufficient evidence link blood clot case vaccine (and AZ produced data either), trial resumed. actually reason trial briefly halted late 2020. lot less canadians died. alright. Well, what's scientific source? We're waiting means 3 weeks, 50% gotten doses. interesting see that’s around mark Israel saw cases fall cliff cause virus couldn’t shit. Hope experience outcome ever 1 people bet 20+ think insane eventually get vaccinated getting downvoted, frustration echoes problem pretty well.

The message young people need? vaccine let return normal faster. No, know exactly fast, enough it, normal July fall much higher chance happening.

Is guaranteed? No. 'good' research tells us happen people get shots. Source better. they're still looking data try figure exactly criteria be.

There's lot factors go that--what percent population immune, much vaccinated people transmit disease, well detect suppress another surge, effective vaccines variants, we'll actually check someone vaccinated.

People often act like know answers many questions we're still ""gathering data"" stage.  think microsecond would happen litigious society make bright-eyed bushy-tailed young mom sign warning form everybody signs getting shot, drops dead blood clot. multiplied 1 case per million. plenty ways generate immense amounts litigation situation. USA risk tolerant society. arguing? original comment support someone simply asked removing mask restrictions outdoors bad idea. simply pointed crowded places outdoors increase risk. meta study proof that. study, see rise infections protests. less expected. protesters still wore masks socially distanced.

You clearly lot conscious smarter. seems misunderstanding. apologize swearing you.

I medical background bugs people offended simple measures even make bad arguments social media reddit. said got angry wrong person apologize again. Great information. Thank you. Still doesn’t totally change opinion AstraZeneca. Blood clotting also bigger side effect vaccines. rolled fast, I’m glad have. think look risks associated decide shot we’re willing take. thanks great video information. I’ll pass on. say I'm genuinely surprised Fauci even hinted anything changing mask recommendations changing soon, thought would much longer happen. guess I'd say recommendation CDC outdoor mask mandates longer needed. Progress progress Jesus christ guys literal babies common everywhere. Good you. I'm pretty sure vaccines going trade school I'm Florida lost job covid regardless lockdown not. Given username I'm surprised ok What? Salaries US way higher lol everywhere Europe.  Tf free? That's super cool.

That Bomb pops bust really hard say. course could it, I'm young would probably asymptomatic. recall day COVID-y symptoms.  Yea part totally makes sense know several people sought due that. 

In case took first appointment could get said Moderna ended J&amp;J. 

I don’t think good comparative data yet approaches lot similarities. I’m watching data come decide makes sense seek booster another company not. 

And sounds like we’ll eventually need boosters anyway. cvs/target little water bottles, juice drinks, goldfish packs granola bars. One thing striking NH’s performance weren’t especially well (above average notably so) week two ago, performance suddenly surged. Something must changed recently. wife vaccine fine. 999,999+ 1,000,000 chances success, folks. LMAO Joe Biden made appearance Sunday night’s televised Roll Sleeves vaccination special, also featured appearances former President Barack Obama , Michelle Obama, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Dr Anthony Fauci , many more. friend, family member, neighbor needs hand ride getting site help out, well, help out. I've said before, safe happy 4th July family friends small groups backyard. risk driving 13 miles. scared J&amp;J vaccine, also get Pfizer/Moderna vaccination site 3.25 miles away (have make round trip twice) reaction 2nd shot pretty bad. high fever 103.4 felt miserable. pain arm pit arm received injection comment helped solve arm pit mystery!

With day passes, people stop listening people like want keep going forever. It’s glorious, deserve way treated everyone even slightly questioned things. someone got team J&amp;J weeks ago, I'm still rooting it. Easiest vaccine I've ever dealt with, personally.

Sure, odds infection 1/300 vs 1/2000 (based efficacy math I've able find) 2, personal circumstances warranted need one done, like odds. That's *275,000 cases one day*, people familiar terminology.  Thankfully, people taking vaccine looking numbers Chile’s study deciding instead panicking subjective statement.

People dying delaying AZ Sinovac shots. Utter nonsense. 

mRNA vaccines completely unproven technology 12 months ago. takes several years build commission plant capable manufacturing them. 

Now know work, Australia rightly looking develop production capacity onshore. Probably like many (if most) advanced economies.  12 hours in, chills &amp; aches made sleep like shit. next day, tired worn day, went bed early. Woke next day, fine since.

I thought left asanine? cure would agree still pass on. Maybe things different vaccinated That's another 62 million doses top 15 million already discarded.  Michigan highest rate positive covid cases entire pandemic. unsurprising correlates highest number pediatric cases Michigan.

And actually:

""The state’s Department Health Human Services reported 50 pediatric cases hospitals Thursday, since post-holiday surge early January.""

This means pediatric cases previous surge currently despite higher caseload. found Ron DeSantis's public statements weekend ""if vaccine, immune, start acting like it"" refreshing! seen much data Sinopharm, Sinovac similar vaccine (both traditional de-activated viral vaccines) released bunch data. seem take longer work vaccines protection might keep going according /r/COVID19/comments/mrpuh2/performance_of_vaccination_with_coronavac_in_a/ reported 73.8% efficacy symptomatic infection 9+ weeks. Dr. Paul Sax, clinical director infectious diseases Brigham Women's hospital Boston, publicly stated today outdoor masks almost entirely unnecessary. 

Can actually follow science listen experts? outdoor mask mandate Massachusetts needs go, enforced anyways.  Interestingly, social psychology tells us amount high, people turn they'll perceive extra risky want pay much. 

Something like $10 might actually get takers. Get together vacation outside US! asked benefit people he's reffering believe vaccine plausibly definitely dangerous. That's plenty reason resent government, there's reason concerned feel toward comments. 20 years vaccine development experience, there's nothing could say would change opinion. Biden didn’t anything lol scientists UK 61% first dose vs 59% US, UK vaccinated much fewer second doses. government decided they'd rather people partially vaccinated people totally vaccinated, they're throwing whole supply first doses. first dose still provides 70% protection.

The good part age groups 50 95% first dose higher, mean younger people vaccinated later US use new vaccines give second doses older people. Nope realise times better spent elsewhere rather replying people without point internet. Maybe get social life year inside might realise get they're putting age restriction point. seems super arbitrary allow 45 year olds take vaccine 25 year olds. Like point actively sabotaging containment. Younger people spread virus way frequently vaccine drastically reduces ability infected people spread virus. understood age based strategy talking high risk individuals, point stupid imo. Anyone flagged positive get test confirm. dogs quickly testing large groups people public. band-aid off, vulnerable already vaccinated messaging miss information surrounding ""vaccines work wear mask"" dangerous could prolong pandemic.If messaging ""get vaccine wear mask"" would win fence sitters. Anti-maskers never converted stop trying.

This true many states. mine opened everyone 16. never phase someone one serious comorbidity, still many vulnerable people got chance. completely agree you, state needs 2 weeks want adopt this. live New York City. People don’t always walk around outside masks on, always wear inside unless eating. people crap purposes determining anything. That's real conclusion provided. usual morons can't source single study back bullshit up. bullshit way down. Ah yes, cremations. remember story used claim China millions dead last January. 

Now, people claim China hardly deaths.  comprehensive info dump / tracker variants? E.g. CDC B117, B1.351, P1, B1.427, B1.429, today Texas announced discovery BV1. wonder academic literature documenting variants MSM caught up. Probably positive cases start significantly dropping. dropping still 7-8x high last summer. hits 2020 summer numbers, mask mandate ends. people like Fauci gone way say ""it changes nothing, cannot return normal people get shot"". still subreddits dedicated among things discouraging taking vaccines. Systemic viral RNA actual viral infections clear pretty quickly. fine. can’t get it, doctor says risk COVID serious lower risk autoimmune disease acting up, I’m happy can. ...okay, post? 

I'm saying Fauci divisive.  understanding emergency use thing shortened bureaucratic/red tape process, trials. information says otherwise? No, last 6 weeks I’ve said repeatedly. point always it’s either strict long (until 8th March) long strict consider includes lot time less restrictions.

Happy 4/20!!! source Pfizer? heard curious- also coincidentally week second :) capacity create 

Are serious? EU one worlds leaders vaccine production 200mln doses produced around half exported countries outside EU. guy. high-tailed vax clinic opened group. Spot on, 'who cares, plenty amazing mRNA' stuff cringeworthy pause happened. 65y old+, medical social worker, teacher, 12th grader serious chronic illness - vaccine Lithuania :( think actually agree may worded poorly. employers tell ( owner dealership) didn’t believe sick days, thats dont offer them. told believe people get sick (shocker) stay home pass on. didn’t see eye eye that. mean really opened back UK. data hospitalisation etc looks good real test May/June try return relative normality assess happens hospitalizations deaths time.

Israel pretty clear evidence vaccines allow return normality (or close it) even kind boosters etc. pretty close open well thanks extremely high vaccination rate ... know there's still UV rays cloudy, right? Cloudiness actually cause UV index higher. right, looked numbers wrong place, listed southern states percentages fully vaccinated, highest states percentages people least one dose. That's bit embarrassing. called antivaxxers stupid selfish. It’s implied referring people called stupid selfish. course there’s risk. There‘s risk every time shove kids car drive around, too, people don’t think twice that. yet I’d speculate there’s good chance kid higher chance dying traffic accident Covid.

The question whether risk tolerable, that’s individual parent. putting mask hardship, goes back fact people weak minded can’t handle minor inconvenience save lives, US filled pussies. concern goes lot parents family children vaccinated. mean obviously we'd prefer spreading anyone enough issue push kinds masks/social distancing restrictions 2022.

So basically I'm saying alternative solutions slowing spread age group like remote schooling. ideal 10% population still risk dictate 90%. may point fall. It’s year, calling people selfish irresponsible doesn’t work anymore Yes that’s true. incentivize vaccine $$$ I’m sure bunch people would get it. Isn’t production company also certify capability supplying facilities advance distribution ventures?

Regardless somebody somewhere held accountable preventable incidents like slow vaccine rollout couple hours get second shot! Yeah know least people COVID got vaccine. Though also know people got COVID intend get think that's true. LA San Francisco NY largest cities people democrats... 3 cities population upper mid west states combined areas always red. are, essentially too. Remember, number right comes states CDC lower actually is. carryover prior days, well day before. goes cases, testing metrics.

It yesterday, 39.5% first doses, vaccinations complete, 25.4%, that's US citizens too! course percent vaccinated based census, numbers changed, estimate.

I think, change could probably two weeks away, earliest. Even though amount vaccinated, full protection fully taken affect, number probably bit lower. think I've read 50% Israel, still bit away us, there's hope things markedly improve soon. yet though, get there. Unfortunately, even J&amp;J full effect, majority still five six weeks full effectiveness, takes awhile. It’s CDC coming ludicrously easy fake vaccine card. Instead handwritten, must requirement printed labels administered stuck cards. 

I’ve seen ones pharmacy site stuck labels mine handwritten pharmacist. get skin cancer cloudy day sunburned (it actually increases light bouncing around).

Cdc recommended temp beef gives damn good tasty results well done.

This whole subreddit dada-esque absurdity point.  everyone reacts illness. may feel ok work, colleagues catch whatever could days. happened me. Workplaces need forgiving sick leave policies encourage everyone stay home even slightly sick. Unlimited sick leave and/or ability work home circumstances would helpful people whose immune systems strong person came feeling ""kind of"" sick. Yes, century. napkin math Hong Kong Flu 1957 influenza pandemic killed 500 per 1,000,000 whereas current pandemic 1,750 deaths per million. 570k deaths vs. 675k 1920 pandemic.

I find interesting common symptom listed people experiencing long covid anxiety disorder. Obviously catching global pandemic scale disease distressing definitely expect residual psychological effects it. purely medicinal standpoint, I'm wondering counted long covid symptom though? India announced 18 years citizens eligible vaccine 1st may happen Gmail, strange. I’m parent four year old. I’m exactly boat. This, exactly. messaging American public health officials since pandemic began pretty bad. messaging specifically vaccines near catastrophic. message be: “these vaccines virtually 100% cure pandemic. Take go back movies, restaurants, cruises, children’s sporting events.” 

I received second Pfizer dose today. two weeks, scientific reason wear mask. Fauci’s comments, still mask rest 2021. really make difficult breathe. parents vaccinated AZ. sure effective variant sweeping India.

Our govt allow us buy Pfizer Moderna even fairness socialism ( shitty quality vaccines all) could even taken flight US get vaccinated govt allow travel getting vaccines send employee home week job requires manual on-site labor?

Did notice comment saying ""coming office""? 

The grand majority office jobs require manual onsite labor.

That said, raise good point, I've said another response need real labor protections country. sore arm, use stress ball side getting shot. get shot, use well move arm around (rotating shoulders, whatever). works arm helps feel less sore. got first last weekend feel sore (unless jabbed punched right got shot). I’m starting suspect people spew “vaccines don’t work variants!!!!!” garbage bots. guys confidently wrong, it’s funny. fully vaccinated mask theatre

Not true. unclear still pass others, still get infected yourself. Moderna prevents 95% infections, 100%. J&amp;J less effective that. theater. encourage vax hesitant moment says okay wear mask vaccinated entire anti vax anti mask group stop wearing claim they're vaccinated.

If % population based could fight better, flipped switch today's 10s millions people would immediately stop wearing herd immunity yet.

Edit: longer waits closer get herd immunity. there's enough studying impact transmission left hold bit longer. It’d great US start exporting some. request lol anyone know chances bad reaction 2nd shot bad reaction 1st? insight here? 

My 1st shot (Moderna) caused severe muscle/joint pain lower back SI joints...to point get bed called ambulance. 2nd shot scheduled Friday I'm terrified getting it. I'm still recovering 1st can't again. showing little empathy everyone else asking cater needs sacrificing ""just little more"". Nice edits. going efficacy 90% that's wont let near still add 100% protection, kids unvaccinated high risk factors involved, I'm risking it. 

I nearly every single high risk factor I'll still gladly around people vaccine rather fear monger efficacy rate. hospital due UK mom covered 95% efficacy kids *also* covered 95% efficacy, that's another story makes virtually impossible get sick importantly, severely sick. 

They still get sick end go hospital, vaccine prevents death. mean can't fall severely ill still. Amazing going complaining 90% I'll wait fully vaccinated instead risking someone visits anti-masker mass congregations twice week.

You still get sick vaccine. looks like stops asymptomatic spread far that's studied actively. Yeah GF even citizen, international student, able get vaccine due respect, disagree assessment never cool. I’ve worked corporate setting long time amount people think it’s badge honor come sick absolutely ludicrous. sick time, doctors notes required, we’re even “encouraged” stay home feel sick. put quotations it’s verbally encouraged matter necessity, please believe upper management judges stay home often affect way you’re treated perceived. toxic culture working sick insanely prevalent today’s workforce it’s always can’t get days don’t get sick time all. It’s often intentionally forced culture. Productivity else.

Majority working population left vulnerable due work related traveling metro cities. downvotes come people spewing misinformation vaccine doesn’t prevent getting covid, reduces mild case. true. vaccines 90% effective preventing infection

But contradicting yourself. guarantee get sick. Moderna example prevents ~95% symptomatic cases, 100% severe cases. point need keep social distancing (as recommended, nothing wrong small group vaccinated people getting together) mask wearing hand washing (which honestly covid disappeared today really still doing). nothing untrue saying vaccines 100% effective infection, unclear infect others even get sick. holup... suggesting responsible people ""stay home"" irresponsible covidiots f'ing stupid get vaccine continuing intentionally spread virus?

It honestly clear post think stay home. staying home work general. least I’d like see companies start implementing work-from-home fridays something like i’ve seen fauci give estimate around 85%, think agree getting 85% people country anything next impossible  Pretty sure people party's get pretty close other. day little dizzy, arm little sore, second day always symptoms peaked, started subside, day 4 baseline. must American Israeli. trials done outside China anyways, downside low cases Ugh I’m little worried. get second shot tomorrow met friend lunch haven’t seen months obligation felt like should. since first shot immunity least. 

anyways, place went one wearing masks (I wore mine double masked entire time minus wasn’t eating) I’m little nervous getting coronavirus. This! also three kids home one extremely high risk covid complications. live heavily red area vaccine appointments gone unfilled slowed 30% vaccinated. Mask wearing never thing here. virus burned hot fast town many caught twice. don’t know we’re going around us don’t vaccinate. Moving isn’t option, keep guard high risk kid (8 yr old) vaccinated. know others town boat. Sure it’s safe vaccinated, everyone yet. move cautiously still. Guess would case? people always find reason upset shocked annoyed. gave specific percentage bet would help, “I’ll know see it” approach doesn’t fly anymore muscle issues seem possible? They're clearly asymptomatic die. hope reason moving quick pace significant amount people going get vaccinated still trials vaccine. government millions vaccines enough people willing take keep lowering threshold.   

Unless missed something supposed take months vaccine producers already everything set different countries supply chain limit. real evidence though... tracks anecdotal evidence I've seen immune response shots. immune system primed, either first shot COVID infection, body seems stronger reaction.

Everyone know who's rough time first shot aware they'd COVID suspected much get tested confirm. means ones taking them? Well I'm making sure understand. injection site itself, like grapefruit sized pimple, entire arm shoulder got shot swollen. can’t spread it

Again, that's exaggeration. Pandemics work absolutes.

You're also completely ignoring I'm saying need set example. you. confident ""did part"" stopped even easiest mitigation measures people could get vaccinated. bugs though find I'm much higher risk realized, made eligible since 3/15, doctors even know it. brought April, doctor said ""I recommend schedule shot"" got automated message I'm eligible I'll get notification, even linked document shows I'm eligible.

Supply limitations not, provider fucked I'm curious people eligibility group notified idea, got sick, possibly even died. Maybe would've still taken due supply, healthcare provider fucked hard IMO.

My wife eligible well that's upsets most... goes work. taken care us notified us, slipped. whole messaging mess since day one get people confused Biden Fauci encourage getting vaccinated still wearing masks. scientific studies saying double masking effective lab setting whole Sturgis Rally group economists claimed caused huge spread.

Also help whole thing politicised since start. I'm point I'm saying fuck it, recluse whole year also reckless going wild parties indoors I'm going keep I'm doing. rest concerns good enough reply?

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Downplaying effectiveness vaccines stopping transmission height anti vaccine argument, find deeply toxic.  someone worked retail throughout pandemic living home family (4/5) coming it, distancing works, hand washing works, mask work, shot works. smart there. running gag idiom, will. Something bad happens 'you hate see it', Something good happens 'you love see it' 

Inverted also good, bad thing happens someone like, love see it. thing say talking Canada sold US 50 years ago dunno, ""We're dropping restrictions get herd immunity"" enough, apparently isn't. reason excellent this, accept slightly incorrect soon say— don’t even know boosters actually necessary near-future. BC adults Friday noon. would have, FDA's emergency approval might given later date. US government might also secured number doses did. could easily position EU countries right now, vaccines still relatively hard come by. That's I'll give Trump credit for. fuck way EU fucked up. one Approximately 56% Israel’s 9.2 million citizens vaccinated another 15% (approximately 700,000 people) recovered Covid-19, putting Israel comfortably expected herd immunity range. Every time girlfriend would give hug... I'd flinch make sure put arms hers.  approved ""emergency use"" slightly EUA process different FDA approval clearance. [emergency use authorization], emergency, FDA makes product available public based best available evidence, without waiting evidence would needed FDA approval clearance. idea liability manufacturers. No, somewhere India, know exactly whole country lockdown. Okay. 

If put charge, exactly metrics need change *aside* vaccination rates recommend end social distancing masking? many people know interest getting say see need “risk it” vaccine understand ""need"" stop wearing masks. big deal work pretty well respiratory diseases. 

Especially high density/low ventilation indoor spaces. Next cold/flu season might still wear medical mask find subway maybe takeout instead indoor dining. would nice cold flu annual basis.  Oh damn. hit day next day? got second dose coming way 3 weeks think Biden said that's hope is, 4th July feel somewhat normal again.

Ironic though alot people act like every day 4th July, hate Biden refuse wear mask get vaccinated. Yep it’s total mess.  states never divided think West Coast whole advantage comes pandemic better suited carrying year-round activities outdoors region country. LA December-January (and perhaps attribute LA far populated dense city West Coast), ugly outbreaks part America. That's patently false. went hoops would FDA approved.  know. bad year Covid nursing family (Covid) death, really follow numbers more. 

Good point, though. I'm Toledo want look up. half people getting vaccinated coming MI, fwiw. Well want pfizer get , also want lose kidney time . Genuinely curious, point observation believe would conclude long term effects, assuming none? 6 months? 12 months? 2 years? Yeah, vaccine promoted return normal life, people would board getting it. Maybe they're young healthy?

I think questionable giving brand new vaccines 90% whatever population. mean 10% vaccinated develop heart failure 3 years die 3 years that? (Not saying think heart failure probable thing, muscle issues seem possible, heart muscle) would spectacular goal country that. Governments considering angles. Mistakes made drugs / vaccines, made again.

There's question covid19 gives trouble old infirm, risk/reward equation easy - get vaccine! healthy know risk vaccines is, they're new, know risks become apparent time. (I think stage 3 trials still ongoing?) younger, healthy people absolutely think taking vaccine valid choice, risk covid low them.  long term issues kids covid? worked live entertainment this, theater near (New England) hosts Broadway tours recently announced they’re reopening full capacity (3,200 people) new season shows starting October. wouldn’t surprised masks required first, time tell, felt good see headline. dropping right now. England 1 death following 1 dose ASAP strategy. link shows Trump fail, plan, left states. unprepared supported federal government. well working? Well according article linked ""The Trump administration’s approach flawed, experts said"" working well, Biden changed it, working better now. 

Seems changed better. Completely factual plan, states supposed plan (which sad federal government shove NATIONAL emergency onto individual states) Actually, I'm trying bait all. potential risks referring to?

I reservations vaccines first. saw science came out, thoroughly convinced *everyone* take them. saw happened Israel. Vaccines pretty much brought pandemic end there. enough old folks get shot--young people step too, get close something like herd immunity. Yeah, even typical bad reactions last day two most. covid I've vaccinated. definitely felt bad day first dose, I've worse hangovers. People downvoting getting vaccinated would net gain society, choosing selfish reasons. Also, covid symptoms mild. worst part still can't smell would recommend getting vaccinated prevent happening. miss able smell things, even bad-smelling stuff.  Source? Honestly care much mask mandates indoors. area, example supposed wear mask entrance restaurant sit take off. often means wearing mask like 30 seconds. Which, way, makes completely useless me, show.

More onerous complete closure indoor spaces, example bars area open, tables spread apart. Restaurants limited capacity, indoor music venues, gyms, movie theaters, activities closed, etc. Somewhat inexplicably, outdoor kids activities also prohibited. masks closures. jawless paul? that's picked gained lot death threats,! got mine 15 minutes ago, 15 observation (leaving now). I’m done! Except maybe side effects tomorrow. 2 week wait full protection. 99.97% chance surviving covid get I've working even since covid started even around people tested positive still managing contract myself. I've also made entire life without participating clinical trial let alone one something massive chance surviving ever catch it. Aside called racist shutting travel origin virus. That’s exactly happened me! vasovagal syncope

I too! Every time get shot get blood drawn, heart rate blood pressure plummet often pass out. HOWEVER, happen first Pfizer shot! (Still waiting second shot.) needle sooooo tiny less 2 seconds, think body even realize happening. low-key freaking hand totally fine. Making excuses anti-vaxxers, nice man common misconception without biden ""turning things around"" would nowhere near now. Biden even took office america track smash goals set terms vaccinations first 100 days. could taken literally changed nothing still achieved goal. symptoms different everyone. me, 2nd pfizer shot made feel fever symptoms struggle get day got it. would pain ass, go work day. symptoms completely vanished next day, except sore arm, good. first grader makes work absolutely hates it. kindergarten struggled mightily COVID. Thankfully starting 4 days week. kids definitely mental stress this. real harm there. afraid 4 year old? preexisting conditions? Ooh, 2m/day? from? thought stuck rate we're foreseeable. That’s fucked Everyone different. Three family members said awful expect likelihood high. lot people said pretty much nothing. overall population pretty young India, low death rate surprising. death even crippling issue India, health system completely overwhelmed broken country extremely high population density many poor areas. lead issues secondary covid, non-covid related deaths, access Health care limited etc. checked today area (sacramento, CA) get appointment anywhere. work food service apparently that's higher priority. really irritating. determined 116 years ago [vaccines legally compelled Fortunately people past knew better, we'd still smallpox polio. county live using J&amp;J vaccine homebound homeless people. Since J&amp;J one done made lot easier get groups people vaccinated. Hopefully J&amp;J vaccine comes back soon. first thought too.

It's like..I work fine I'm also sick cold. able work home get people sick. Seems like win-win situation feel like employers agree course wouldn't. Sorry bro, I've felt plenty safe eating working without mask long time now. I've got Fauci ouchies I'm outta fucks give! Partying Florida next weekend! still scared wait two weeks two weeks another 2 weeks wait 2 weeks well probably get it. rest us moving on. surprising became problem virus got politicized. worse. totally organic point. New York Times article (not even opinion piece) written people like you: Victory Covid involve elimination. Victory instead mean turning sort danger plane crashes shark attacks present — small worth reordering lives. look person's post history. argue. anyone know vaccines become FDA-approved? Like possible year. understand people. Economically, microchip would much extra work literally phones already that... Emergency approval *technically* different standard approval, vaccines went hoops. actually hit extra rep bench day first shot lol Would run race without finish line? Sounds tiring. This. one cares long get shot. necessary rush vaccines less total deaths countries die single day? need investigation role &amp; influence T-cells block viral replication. seen hard data measures T-cell response quantifiable way vaccines. Oh, we'll get 70% employers mandate it. will. Business liability insurance make sure that.  it’s approved emergency use - people don’t trust fast came think fair. someone doesn’t want vaccinate themselves, shouldn’t forced it’s fully approved Terrible analogy Imma get 2nd Pfizer shot May5, everyone tells drink water one.

Like, I'm good shape stuff, hope mess bad. making nervous lol Fauci, Biden, pretty much public health officials local national levels agree closing schools harmful.

Glad worked kid, think myopic response. Memorial Day Washington California likely still restricted. 

And “lit” country last year. Didn’t see spike afterwards? sick days. Sorry, can't take pay. I'll wear mask tho  Day9? paying £5000 subject. Genuinely curious figure vaccines without Trump? think response would different different president? Like let's say Hillary won, think would done differently would vaccines? amount selfishness ignorance comments illustrates Covid got bad. Yeah, second Pfizer Thursday. took Friday off, hear second shot rough day two afterward. Models abstraction reality. real world, model's assumptions tested change unpredictable ways. new variant significantly transmissible, new variant evades immune response, population heterogeneity leaving subgroups still vulnerable, variances background seropositivity rates would affect whatever ""magic number"" might give.

What happens say 70% new variant requires like 85%? 30% unvaccinated appear disproportionately other's networks (hint: do) get sustained outbreaks among vaccine skeptics? 70% fine NYC many year ago still short upstate communities need? 50% appears fine, previously seropositive people start getting infected again?

The need walk back ""magic number"" gave would damage credibility even though public understand complicated - scientists. *flashes back Wild* Obviously way 100% sure exposed, got one two-dose vaccines couple weeks pretty high degree protection already. worry unless start symptoms. research distinguish pfizer moderna? guess must think there's obvious difference two? second one Saturday nothing sore arm. expecting anything rest family got really much, although mother didnt pop days later maybe today tomorrow

one friend mine floored second dose, call sick work Yeah also logical. second exposure antigen typically robust response. Better stay separate, course, interact people, outdoors MUCH safer indoors: here! Husband 30's got second pfizer last week. sore arm second night getting chills went sleep early. certain we'd sick since we're young caught covid. worse getting flu shot, also yearly. Oh gotcha, thanks 👍 never set begin with. flu strain vaccine created every year narrowed-down-to-1 strain predicted virulent prevalent flu virus strain thousands mutations flu virus occur species every year. It’s vaccine “does doesn’t work”, it’s predicted dominant strain ends dominant one all, even though likely circulating populations. dominant strain circulates well that’s people vaccinated still end flu. vaccine harm foul though, would still likely protect individual severe symptoms long strain isn’t much different strain they’re vaccinated (read protein spikes viruses-interesting stuff). It’s guessing game scientists pretty damn good predicting modeling every year deserve lot thanks appreciation.

On assumptions Covid: family member Covid-like illness month Covid declared state side. got her. pretty convinced actually already based symptoms antibody test negative. point is, can’t assume without proper testing factual evidence. 

The sooner world vaccinated less likely virus mutate. reason getting boosters it’s already mutating. strains becoming stronger result need protection. aren’t vaccinated others community get Covid community could patient zero next mutating strain. Um buddy live India yes know hesitancy problem well areas claim entirety India stretch. Based experience covidiots.   websites like deceptive articles put companies like Would really rather decent chance losing sense smell taste potentially months end get flu like symptoms days? seems like bizarre preference me. know couple healthy people late teens early 20s got loss taste. think normal ICU capacity is? doesn’t mean virus spreading rampantly within schools, strict masking social distancing arrangements minimize student contact kept transmission check. Rather, outbreaks reflection students contracting virus outside school, according school officials expert tracked COVID-19 cases schools private K-12 schools Maine sites 52 75 active outbreaks listed Maine Center Disease Control Prevention week. school-related cases represent 10 percent state’s total cases past month. one school recorded outbreak 20 cases.

Feel like headline due article justice. Kids making larger share cases Maine (likely due vaccination), evidence spread schools.

Many encouraging schools close latch onto headline read article. Try drug store. state’s sign opened adults earlier month still haven’t heard anything. set appointment Thursday Friday time slot Walgreens. 20 mins.  Awesome. great feeling, it?

Looking forward second one Thursday. ""vaccine hesitancy"" I'll stopping traffic lights way vaccination site.  everyone cared others much 😔 mean median mode? Haha covid deaths know? diseases irrelevant. ""Getting sick sucks.""

I mean, I've taken lot vaccines basically why.

Whether super-rare lethal less-rare usually annoying disease matter much. whole ""99% people die covid"" thing matter me. want bed shit week.

The thing that's weird covid vaccines very, good - way better typical flu shot. first covid shot took literally 5 minutes get, plus 15 minutes resting afterward make sure immediate reaction it. everybody get this? already leading vaccinations started. Trump still president. certainly not. get everyone said unsafe.....? logic tenuous, best. reading situation correct, keep using critical thinking skills. paragraph: ""One studies also compared frequency adverse reactions first dose either Pfizer Moderna vaccine 231 people either previously tested positive SARS-CoV-2, never exposed it. found symptoms pain swelling injection site similar groups patients, whole-body reactions, fatigue, headache, chills, fever, muscle joint pains, frequently reported recovered COVID-19"" 

There's also link paper there. fact town library one room open super annoying , rest building blocked off, people go close together would could use whole building. Really cool stickers buttons. free food. faster timeline. found recent sources proving Moderna produce CD8+ many random sources showing didn't.

All random sources referring back phase 1 moderna data animal trials feb-june (the last phase 1 enrollment April 14) last year. super weird recent sources CD8 T-cell responses S-2P detected low levels second vaccination 100-μg dose group (Fig. S11).

...is thing says. possible timeline cell production much longer antibody/B cell production. mRNA vaccines seem work days, protection symptom onset kicks around day 11. Compared AZ protection seem even start day ~30. perhaps stunts production cells later... Yep stood line hour Kaiser emailed called get vaccine. annoying, going wait year get India vaccine hesitancy problem way round. city days people queueing 5am outside vaccination centres open 8am. Everyone wants jab  pubs fully open? Inside out, full capacity?  seemingly controversial attribute spread covid seasonal patterns see respiratory viruses? mean, deny human behaviour plays sort role.

But can't coincidence spread covid country, Canada, nearly identically follows spread seasonal influenza. people blaming third wave variants, explain places UK variant become dominant seen spikes following occurrence.

See Figure 7: Get antibody test know Covid not. guess.

You keep repeating concerned. Concerned what? Concerned need booster? what? free. need booster 6 months now, get booster 6 months now. meantime, contributing herd immunity, good thing. Sure are. enough UK people feeling like depression/insanity locked last many months (4?) worthwhile given beautiful COVID numbers now? one-dose AZ strategy + restriction produced amazing results COVID front. Hopefully see better numbers month released restrictions. find interesting think Rockefeller family relevant enough still part conspiracy. Well that's interesting. Tell us that? Shit, would explain demons trying possess then. thought pretty inside... totally agree you. sub loves singular opinon everything related covid. 

We TONS data showing healthy young people risk Covid limited data vaccine's affect widespread groups sub want acknowledge that. I’m similar boat, trying decide risks vs. reward makes sense me. I’m completely healthy, walk 5 miles day, positive ANA — though evidence autoimmune disease. Given there’s long term studies people RNA vaccine +Ana autoimmune disease, I’m really hesitant. However, I’m seeing rheumatologist week, discuss. didn’t pesky Ana would likely gotten it, like yesterday. need over. (Edited spelling) Including Navaho Cherokee ? Yes, everyone reading ""gets"" point trying make. opposite people responding to. I'm clearly better informed you. I'm also concerned welfare others you. Nothing ""high mighty"" it. good human.  pardon? Fauci along. removed spotlight Dr Atlas put place. remember? Ah. Alberta? interested troubles? Alberta right now! Really?
Federal government plans adults dose July.

Our supply also aligns I'd paid enough. June lost taste smell. long term effects Covid, I'm already getting them. actually, seriously research valid sources online (as in, anti-vax conspiracy sites, legit sources like CDC, medical universities, et cetera) find risk everything terrible orders magnitude higher covid vaccines. even remotely close. looking forward  I'm Alberta!
BC/Alberta/Ontario first dose general population July quite easily

I guessing Maritimes might different It’s literally weeks. Every adult Canada wants one June. one took grandfather get his. see signage least obvious location argument anti-vaxxer would make would microchip. 

It's way big pharma force one system control. can't XYZ ""top-up"" vaccine idea ""herd immunity"" gives plausible deniability. ""top-ups"" would become frequent could often monthly daily like take pills everything ADHD blood pressure. 

And they'll able skirt government oversight due ""emergency status"" never truly know going bodies. say let 450 years good behavior. welcome   least I’d like see companies start implementing work-from-home fridays something like that

I think we, culture, need evaluate FAR 'work home Fridays'. 

I think need see something much drastic, like 20+% office jobs work home permanently. majority remainder office 2-3 times week, tops. 

Employers moderately competitive job market going find massive disadvantage demand workers who've WFH year return 9/5 5 days week. ""I'm waiting see"" crowd ""Never"" crowd? mostly referring never crowd rural white republicans. Younger 18-34 demographics typically wait see since they're low risk disease. course there's mixing crowds. Maybe we’re guilting shaming hard enough, always work right? Right? Great stuff! Thank sharing Politics conspiracy theories. Sweden capacity give everyone one dose 6 weeks. Currently real problem administering weekly delivery week. changes, alternatives done need yet. Damn susceptible demonic possession??

God damn man shot rad. 45 days positive test. positive asymptomatic die suddenly 45 days later it. attempting funny actually believe nonsense. Life Pro Tip: vaccinated sorts places, people know places like Walgreens, CVS, etc, even local mom pop pharmacy actually house calls older folks boot. I'm getting mine Costco places. normal channels still booked up, think outside box bit. can't really fault countries falling behind, understanding US established resources hoard much could early on. 

Equitable, hardly, gold, say. Like usually do, go work sick. places, Covid, allow wear mask well. spread around. Poland started train jabs Pharmacy soon available. well lots volunteers training start mass vaccination program. believe so, asymptomatic. sure would help, but:

1. vaccine trials succeeded quickly mostly disease spreading fast. Normally, takes many years infectious disease vaccines prove effectiveness, volunteers get infected glacial pace. Covid spreading rapidly evidence effectiveness generated within months.
2. used vaccine development taking decades that's saw lifetimes. early vaccines easy 1800's physicians really know viruses could develop rudimentary vaccine within months work. Vaccine research existing diseases slow easy problems got solved centuries ago, stuck hardest nuts crack. Covid brand-new virus, could easy rabies hard HIV, got lucky. like SARS1, might still stuck animal research phase. look website, feel like saying that. would like say There’s sort multi-organ inflammatory syndrome, well “long-haul Covid”, symptoms seem persists months. It’s small chance, seems pretty rough getting it. That’s entirely dependent many people you’re around tho. lot people come across thousands people month people might see 100 Anything vaccine joke, gotta add /s disclaimer... literally people believe things like that... worse. mad times. 

But, yes joke form, amusing especially told nurse. Lol turning 54 year went exact process last couple weeks. need appointment! might surprised many bots get trying push narrative varying levels sophistication. China huge it, watch thread that's somewhat negative china see 'ten cent army' come play. Lots nations well, particularly Russia. part international politics, shaping narrative. Almost? Daily see posts people talking fully vaccinated terrified interacting someone public without mask on. never checked actual fever, know swollen arm producing crazy amounts heat, worse bad sunburn. arm felt almost hot touch. Got shot number one 20 min ago riding home! hundreds people lined things moving fast! Feeling hopeful right now! Drink lots water! second shot floored next day understanding allergy contradiction would peg allergy. whatever reason, seem like allergy history somewhat likely react additional studies. reaction rate around 2-5 per million. allergies penicillin cespholorins. complete 30 minute wait instead 15 fine. ebay.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments. 

If believe made mistake, please let us know.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  cleared two weeks post second shot, planning send 8 year old back classroom couple weeks, also hot spot, worried.  I'm sorry happened you. 

I know there's actual data (would love see so), anecdotally, know TON vaccinated people now, know one person big reaction shots. people bigger reaction dose 1, (of circle, least) bigger reaction dose 2, yeah - cannot think single person got slammed both. thing often hard people like understand big portion America never particularly worried getting passing virus first place. understand that’s insane, fact still need people vaccinated. used track spreadsheets virus data people knew that, questions ever fielded COVID restrictions would go away. huge contingent America way worried restrictions virus. us worried virus, benefits vaccination obvious, worried restrictions, news articles say getting vaccinated won’t stop transmission lasts 6 months (neither true) look say “Why bother getting two shots make feel like shit protect disease don’t care getting, especially vaccine won’t stop spreading it, indication getting vaccinated directly help make restrictions go away?” suggest tying removal restrictions number people vaccinated. Give people carrot behavior want. can’t keep getting mad seeing way instead helping society needs do. Yes is.

""good data"" randomized controlled trials. link none. propose modelling approach combines four computational techniques merging statistical, inference artificial intelligence tools. validate findings two external datasets recording 42,151 additional NPIs 226 countries.

If best data crap, magically become crap virtue ""best crap pile"". get less crappy throw magical model AI speculated.

Yeah know like folks study cited. That’s really early. India currently like 8% vaccinated, right? uptake really low something? Mine handwritten me...they gave blank. See comment above. vaccines eliminate risk death/hospitalization. absolutely still contract COVID vaccinated though symptoms much less weren't. Sick people need stay home *rest* get better. Nobody rest hundred emails phone calls deal with. cause body stress, get better, making vulnerable illnesses. know mean! feels like anti-maskers *juuuust* finally starting realize they're loudly, baldly, boldly, showing give fuck lives others wearing mask, trying hardest project sociopathy onto others assuage (possible?) guilt calling *caring lives others yourself* 'virtue signaling'. Nobody likes joke. Well, guy gave second dose did. Lol, sure oiece mind done. got mine weeks ago even though i'm 39. stroke years ago... right afterward, arms would flail strapped down. well werent, flailed, hit trach, aspirated blood.  gave necrotizing pneumonia,,, eligible vaccine early. worth it. People take time need. 

What shouldn’t shame returning normal faster they’re personally comfortable with. Another thing people mention re: Fauci part failing his. Fauci asked question feels/how he's acting, he's answering viewpoint 80-year-old man. COURSE 80-year-old inherently higher risk even post-vax going continue following safety guidelines closer average person. answer gets interpreted/reported ""Fauci says THIS!"" suddenly got millions people following health safety advice 80-year-old man, even they're half century younger him. Every pharmacy area stock already. wait list. Using word ""fearful"" instead less emotionally-charged word like ""cautious"" ""wary"" misleading. real-world studies confirm vaccines almost completely stop asymptomatic spread, strongly suspect case. could happen day. think it’s important distinguish Americans don’t WANT come work sick, don’t PTO call ability work home. agree getting folks continue wear masks sick going uphill battle they’ve (insanely) politicized. Ah yes, nefarious teachers! guess theres point quarantine people coming less likely carry virus population. get infected SARS-CoV-2 develop covid. body fight vaccine, flu, never develop covid. could still carry enough virus nose infect someone else. seems incredibly unlikely vaccinated people spread covid, research isnt completed yet. 

It may also virus airborne anyone admitted far. spread covid catch covid. Active case counts falling many areas time lows. Even Michigan seems peaking now. Workplaces need mandated OSHA allow leave necessary vaccinations.

If weekends (2 days), probably works customer facing position usually hourly. super easy ask time off... get paid. many people that's much incentive calling off. Would nice, know distribution capacity vaccine. use became eligible schedule today since really focused vulnerable state.

While sad US snatch much vaccine, countries obligation try get vaccine citizens. vaccine given away unused capacity distribute denying American vaccine leaving risk. anti science, paranoid conspiracy crap seen regurgitated sun. Same! one first wearing mask markets, like 1 2 others. imagine I'll probably one last stop. Yep, dizziness, fever, headache, severe fatigue, horrific night sweats. Lasted 30 hours gradually felt better course day. think there's considerable overlap people vaccine hesitation taken covid seriously contracted giving level immunity you’re selfish irresponsible? pandemic isn’t calendar year. works all. Got second moderna shot 18 hours ago! Slept great far side effects either dose. Arm little sore, tetanus shot got months ago hurt way more. read two weeks first dose 80% protected infection I've going bars, meeting new people, kinds fun things since. vaccine must work pretty well, far good!

I saved time last year since law fun things outside house. playing enough video games watching enough tv was, staycation really needed. Told would vaccination matter politicians bureaucrats say. Got kinds vacations lined starting next week! I've saying memorial day. Would really nice kickoff mask burning parties then! People growing less hesitant, lot peer group example gotten first shot jnj one max effectiviness yet.

It kind puts damper planning get togethers one wants get together go prematurely. friends group least May seems like big shift back normal socialization. misunderstanding vaccine efficacy means. Vaccine efficacy absolute chance catching disease, relative risk reduction non-vaccinated individuals. 

Being high risk area means receive efficacy data faster people placebo group (and vaccinated group matter) catching diseases. mean vaccine somehow becomes less effective greater spread. 

[Here's article 

You right risk exposure example high. mentioned post. using easy numbers avoid tiny percentages. Change labor laws don’t get fired reprimanded using sick days. then, don’t much choice. Well yea, that’s obvious. got shots. Fortunately we've got plenty evidence indicates fomite transmission rare irrelevant. Isnt true others well though? took J&amp;J trial. (Placebo, ended getting real thing day able book appointment Pfizer. decided stick trial wish gotten Pfizer. Well they're heavier, one side bad posture. percentage OH tested positive covid-19? it’s around 5-10%, people going vaccination site pretty representative general public. Officially fully vaccinated-meaning 2 doses + 2 weeks. Let’s party! That's great going waste. hope people actually take it. I've heard people vaccine shopping turning AZ, frustrating. cold virus, chill. vaccinated family members first time since pandemic began. result? got listen sister-in-law tell 581k would died anyway prevented flu deaths actually pretty good past year.

No wonder impacted social distancing, lol. Thanks reading rant!  Neat, really answer question would matter friend felt comfortable wearing them. good friend want feel comfortable. Cool story, getting one. well Millions upon millions Americans. I’ve always pretty vocal time off. I’m already something extra needs get done always far easier handle coming day off. 

I worked automotive field staying late finish job helping customer usually wasnt big deal often staying extra 1/2 usually still got home time due traffic wasn’t allowing fresh start, come Saturday want scheduled. chance. 675 k near average year heart disease days US... yeah, no, that’s never experience. one day doctors note required.

Given expensive see doctor, long takes get appointment, one going doctor basic sore throat, unless won’t go away get worse. I'm worried hesitancy, I'm worried apathy. Scheduling appointment pain ass right much motivation someone risk get vaccinated. I’m contradicting keep posting false narrative. vaccines prevent infection, symptomatic infection. They’re extremely effective. add this. anyone Buffalo another northern state near Ontario confirm required ID? I’m tempted go US get vaccine. Got pfizer #2 2 days ago, currently floored loving Yes, I've met share people know world works. think compromising safety sake misinformed people right move. talking about??

I still wear masks, seen parents year, got fully vaccinated late February. People like exactly going end pandemic asap, please go back bunker leave us peace. point i’m waiting birthday 😢 Come think it, friends got stickers getting vaccinated. didn’t get damn thing! mask mandate ended Indiana April 6th, anecdotally tell amount people wearing masks given grocery store before. think ""throw mask crowd"" whole time. Also, one actually enforces mandate here, sign door it.

Local police departments declared back April 2020 enforcing state mandate. it’s infectious disease get spread it. yeah one implies another. would ever dock someone PTO working home prior policy?  WORKING. Ohh yes. 20 somethings bit elusive though I’m sure given time come around. It’s highly likely know someone directly indirectly who, unfortunately, hit COVID. Also, social media huge age group perhaps read posts long COVIDs aren’t apathetic give shit closest relatives least? Hopefully, majority won’t take much time coming senses. difference people made decision reopen schools claim safe dubious evidence actually power make call make happen. Random redditors spouting opinions. Actual decision-making processes impact real-world things higher level stringency. BRING DOWNVOTES.

We've sending 4yo preschool 2 days week year. school single case, teacher, asymptomatic. student teacher tested positive.

We (in opinion) made right call worth risk send him. Traveling, spending holidays family large groups people, amazing.

See, shit used do, resume really soon. sure makes particularly amazing besides fact seem done purposely knowing others wanted things couldn’t. probably slept upwards 12 hours second dose. felt extremely sore achy everywhere places demand sagged. That's bad thing. Anecdotal again, colleague works one Toronto hospitals someone 40 years old admitted last week increased average age admission. Unfortunately almost half US population ignorant religious people refuse participate. virus could problem long thanks ignorance. sure thank think I've ever flu, 5th day came work pretty good, around 10am weird cramp turned lots stomach pains, thought food poisoning, went home early, nauseous fatigued, body aches, evening fever 100, sweating night stomach pains. Woke next day pretty good, besides tired. feel worse first second? Well, think countries suspended tomorrow. surprising, since J&amp;J also suspended deliveries EU it’s anyway tiny amount initial delivery. 

I hope vaccine recommended EMA meeting tomorrow. speed good sir. OK, basing entirely speculation? cesspit vaccinated people great tacos vaccine proven safe effective ‘I’m tired this’. way lived last year default human condition. default human condition kids playing together outside. default condition turn showers national park campground. default condition spending time indoors family friends.

We proven safe effective vaccine. Vaccinated people giving liberty live without fear based safe effective data. somehow see vaccine isn’t sufficiently effective show it. 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻same (even impact directly I’m there) children teenagers seed infections among adults transmission efficient, estimate overall, school opening indirectly associated 26% increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission.""

We can't stick heads sand pretend children somehow completely immune therefore count towards herd immunity. absolutely count. giant secret outbreak least kids would get sick rather identifiable clusters getting poked right...about....NOW! Outdoors, probably somewhat soonish (few months). Indoors probably stay while. I'm sure placebo arms all, any, pediatric trials. believe points mostly finding proper dosage (durable immune response versus side effects) assessing safety.

In addition even placebo arm, might fewer 50% -- (adult) Novavax trial 67% active vaccine, start crossover injections, giving 100% active vaccine.

I signed Pfizer pediatric waitlist signing Novavax pediatric waitlist go crossover injection. Right, eligibility opens doesn’t mean shots give. normal circumstances supply would probably increase anyway, J&amp;J hold hear we’re going average week. IL issue somewhat similar one flagged. Basically, lots places trying get shots arms fastest, trying get somewhat equal % uptake across counties (or DC, wards). scenario demand uneven, end excess supply areas, sometimes excess supply significant. Yup! preaching mantra since scheduled shot 1 parents unfortunately trumpsters. scared going get vaccine listening ilk fox news 24/7. However, also know 5 people died covid; FIVE one year. I've encouraged wear masks stay distant , etc.. year, think 2nd person knew died taking seriously started take seriously. knew something it. highly educated professionals , one Engineering field, understand actual Science. know support outright lies co-vid still know deadly killed friends, are. first line want sign vaccine fully vaccinated still wearing masks,  I'm glad fox news cult hold tight them. Everyone's reactions different. nothing sore arm first second Moderna shots. even lasted 1 day. live NJ we’re spike cases right now, get hesitant going out. 

I’m getting first dose tomorrow I’m trying stay remaining six weeks till I’m fully vaccinated, current case numbers. J&amp;J shot 2 weeks ago, today I'm considered fully vaccinated. They're hiding anything. research happening right open. Questions hypotheses shared, results published come out. People like Fauci best explain things way everyone understand, complexities ongoing research can't boiled talking points exact numbers. people demand exact answers, exact answer available lot questions right ""We know yet.""

If really want know nitty-gritty details, going put work research yourself. guy mid 20's ain't looking like able get first shot till September (maybe even later) Canada really dropping ball comes rollouts. It’s making masks permanent, it’s thinking others wearing you’re sick

Which Asia decades. US already vaccinated 50% adults yesterday. comment ridiculously wrong. Yes sure also India population 1.4 billion people. I’m assuming means overnight, several hundreds millions people suddenly become eligible. 

While know deals made ramp production vaccines approved, would surprised would make difference supplies may 1st. 

So far, understood, local manufacturers ramp production ordering supplies probably increase production capacity. takes weeks months happen (today April 19th already). 

On side, new approved vaccines don’t make available. Russia said would ship Sputnik V didn’t see numbers (and look much supplying countries deliveries usually “small” (if compare India’s population). Moderna said busy look it, Pfizer said wanted first specific article contract couple days ago India’s government agreed to. don’t remember JJ’s position matter. 

All I’m saying is: hope opening vaccination 18+ soon create tensions chaos many people doses show centres. Another variant recently emerged California, United States, designated B.1.429, contains four missense mutations spike, one single L452R RBD mutation. ability B.1.1.298 B.1.429 variants evade neutralizing [humoral prior infection vaccination yet determined.  


Excerpt study 


B.1.617 L452R mutation well host others. lifted restrictions week ago, UK still long strict lockdown. get mainly due long lockdown, every day though vaccines work Can't find appointments lists waiting Virginia... Great start. We’ve done though. limited vacation days really want top take day lie bed sick, especially “not bad” 

Its something needs change society. Ive reading locally lot business (Hotels fast food) really hard time finding people work crap wages benefits offering. even without $15 min wage mandate going forced offer better wages compete UI add Gvt benefits fill positions. 

In white collar workforce employers going deal people dont want return commute office grind permanent WFH going negotiating point. people read article thought agreed them. read article, since kids known asymptomatic carriers older kids (middle school, high school) transmit covid rates adults, find difficult believe make firm, factually based claim covid *definitely* spreading schools unless they're regularly testing asymptomatic kids schools. 

I think testing asymptomatic kids practical, understand schools it, I'm saying I'm skeptical claims missing key pieces information. 

A lot early studies said ""Nah, covid definitely spread among kids,"" lacking data, plus methodology studies kinda sloppy. example, schools reported data based theoretical policy, real world conditions, included results private schools (which vastly different public schools) schools attendance low 5%. 

I'm anti science weirdo, want kids go back school, think claims policies place super sketch may missing key information. 

For example, area, schools made zero adjustments policies/practices response new variants, even though know they've become predominant strains community, make distinction elementary school children middle/high school students known transmit covid vastly different rates. 

I look I'm like...guys, y'all doing? 1: would be?

2:Wut? really way go without vaccine passports. mental gymnastics issue want ultimately we're trying minimize spread can't single people out, way tie metric. It’s also important people get vaccine reactions know it’s normal they’re actually dying. going life expecting bad reactions, suddenly spiked massive fever horrible body aches, would assume vaccine actually done something horrible proceed panic. Thanks stories like this, get fever body aches second dose, I’ll know take Tylenol sleep off. drove DC Florida yesterday. Message signs around Columbia advertising vaccine clinics appointment needed. Amazing difference easy get vaccine state state. I'm one assumed shots today! wOOt wOOt understand rush open achieve close.

I mean, disagree you. I'm trying rush. Speaking only, want world ""back normal"" absolutely safe so! ...it's ok excited hopeful, too. anti-science say can't wait get back normal (although waited) believe scenario wildly unrealistic. full 40% US Adult population reluctant refusing get vaccine, we're seeing breakthrough infections immunized populations US overseas variants.

there's fear mongering anywhere worry about. care kids care yourself. that's fine - GAF SARS young single kids. anecdotal stories apply here. 

your previous comment still irrelevant echoing I've stated reasons let mom mingles anti-maskers regularly get near kids. unvaccinated high risk yourself, responsible welfare another unvaccinated high-risk person, would make sense skip it.

However, neither apply you, I’d say it’s fine go want. logistics seem specific location. showed 2 hrs early CVS appt done 10 mins Luckily Greece approaching worst deaths crisis position encourage vaccine hesitancy...

Oh wait. popped /r/introverts couple weeks ago one top posts time thread ""I'm ready pandemic end"". folks comfortable bubble, pandemic reassuring sense ""validates"" choices. Also, constant news topic discuss online. recommends workers flu symptoms upon arrival work become ill day promptly separate workers go home least 24 hours fever gone without use fever-reducing medications, symptoms improved (at least 4-5 days flu symptoms everyone flu fever. Individuals suspected confirmed flu, fever, stay home work least 4-5 days onset symptoms. Persons flu contagious first 3 days problem is, people usually call sick fever. However, recovery process flu week you’re still going couching lung fountain mucus runny nose. point, you’re still contagious. 

The CDC disagrees you. say fever breaks 24 hours worried spreading it. Right thing got sore arm times, much less sore second. won’t respond that. That's arbitrary line that's chosen, yes. Even though person well protected 2 weeks first mRNA shot 2 weeks J&amp;J. much lower risk, many children gotten sick even died. I'd like avoid possible.

Let’s goooo! primary/secondary schools still 2+ months left? Although accept premise (that fearful) rhetorical question, I'll give good faith response:

1. vaccine prohibits death/hospitalization COVID; still contract disease vaccinated. Sure. relief die COVID, mean I'm chomping bit go catch it. 

2. still LOT people vaccinated. Estimates range 70-90% adult population needing vaccinated end pandemic. (Note: eradicate COVID. That's longer possible.) number undoubtedly decrease children eligible vaccine, even close reaching numbers right now. (And may ever polling numbers refuse ever vaccinated true) so, seems premature start living life though pandemic personally, fully vaccinated. 

3. Related: live ""red"" area. LOT people refusing ever vaccinated. Couple reports people forging vaccine cards, forgive distrust people running around local Walmart actually vaccinated taking advantage loosening restrictions. related points above. people's actions, still going significant community spread here, particularly variants added mix. continue double mask public want get sick - even I'm going die it.

4. live society (I believe) ought respect impact others. good data whether vaccinated individuals contract COVID transmit others. requires literally effort mask public protect life (including children) yet vaccinated. take small step safe community transmission reduced?

5. problem congregating indoors friends family also fully vaccinated. live amongst many selfish people trust behave way public. ... Yet.

I think I'm acting cautiously, fearfully. long year, year. blip hopefully long, fruitful life. end day, I'm willing put absurdly small inconvenience longer part bring end faster. 

(Also: anecdotal, vaccine hesitant I've spoken express hesitancy efficacy vaccine, safety. I'd say safety concern relates either use mRNA, relatively new, and/or speed vaccine developed. know asking people continue wear mask (or not) undetermined, indefinite, amount time changes someone's mind safety concern.) get. concerns people's mental emotional health paranoid think nefarious leaders making dastardly plans to... make people wear face masks need to. ludicrous idea many people act like actually believe. blood clot issue would never dedicated trial. rare detect ""small"" trial 50,000 people. also gives idea incredibly rare is. 

The fact paused vaccine delivery *one confirmed death 7 million administered doses* (this number *could* go looking increasingly likely - albeit risk subgroups may higher) demonstrates incredibly seriously vaccine safety taken. 

The US administered 200 million vaccines (between JnJ, Moderna, Pfizer). one death probably linked vaccine administration. *One*.

If 30, likely die *this hour* sitting home catastrophic unpredictable brain aneurysm die COVID vaccine administration. Interesting, thanks! sure getting downvoted. EU lagging behind vaccines rather severely, ""securing batches"" manafacturers, importantly capacity create independently US (far recently) UK.

Lost batches, hidden batches, unfulfilled orders. field day tinfoil hatters such.

If that's handle virus fatally targets mostly old immunocompromised people (gross oversimplification facts, know), even wanna know ""we"" work something much, much severe that.

Who’s saying it’s over. positive sign though since based happened Israel surge people letting guard early vaccines rolled enough people got vaccinated shut surge cases tanked. cases may go back positive sign may turned corner last surge. lives miserable us risk lives protests, Bolsonaro still many supporters can't ousted easily. word ‘essential’ lot first sentence that’s defined varies lot place place says nothing open check someone's passport Brazilian visa let it. rocket science. Fauci contributed divineness quote.  feel he's lost credibility mean public feels way. issue nobody knows actual number may value unreachable unless vaccines become mandatory.

Going curious see 2 numbers they're published see need go get topped off. 🤣😂 comments fucked rashly name calling pig like war drugs? new anti-vax talking point ""5-year long term studies""? compromised immune system mean immune response weaker, likely *weaker* symptoms shot, stronger. Yeah, vital part vaccine programs herd immunity. 

How get matters far less, fuss vaccine take silly: every dose used someone's arm. Dane Norwegian one vaccine another, vaccine dose end African's arm instead. arguing semantics talking around subject anti-social shut-in lockdown agenda.

Very transparent frankly tragic Ah-ha! [REAL shows last! /s What’s difference? 

I’m using analogy point argument is:

“If disagree risk taking behavior don’t deserve medical treatment.” 

And selectively applying coronavirus suits bias, many medical conditions, far serious corona, Obesity AIDS. people don’t understand vaccine politics lol give examples vaccines relatively short term effects proved hidden long term effects? seems improbable I'm curious types effects expect show later show first 6 months? Anyone weird, long-lasting taste smell problems getting covid specific things? lack of, changed perception. Partner November starting last like three months ago full week nearly everything ate foul garbage taste. faded away, stuck around enough anything kind articifical (sometimes real) red berry scent flavor weird, garbage-y taste smell. frustrating strawberry one favorite things. like strawberries, raspberry vodka, starberry syrup bubble tea, raspberry filling donuts, etc. super weird, bad taste. use strawberry shampoo smells like death me. partner, peanut butter!! ehh??

Jokes pb&amp;j aside, anyone else experience this? can't imagine covid related I'm hoping vaccine eventually fix somehow cuz losing palette strawberry rest life sad, man... does, thank That's lovely narrative maths... Brits take average 1.1 journeys day, USA higher population taking 4 trips day. Britain 'suburbia' find 328 million people taking 4 car journeys day vs 66 million taking car 1.1 journeys per day.

We would expect 328 deaths CSVT US everyone used AZN assuming 1 death per million vaccine. 

38000 annual US deaths (from source looked up) road traffic accidents, 4 journeys per day.

That's 38000/4/365 = 26 deaths journey get vaccine.

326 vaccine, 26 trip.

In UK 66 vaccine, 4 trip.

326/26 = 12.5

66/4 = 16.5

Almost exactly risk profile, vaccine 10x likely result death (assuming 1 1 million die) car journey take vaccine.

But note: evidence excess deaths directly attributable vaccination. probably due use Moderna/Pfizer seem (slight) risk profile AZN vaccine.

Which would make car journey risky US taking typical US hand, UK saying thing, deaths due vaccination, even Norway Germany finding cases CSVT. turns out, recorded, see pattern) sister pregnant got vaccinated. FERPA nothing people actually contact tracing. identified 20 person outbreak. I'm sure asymptomatic. larger secret outbreaks. work dumbass move too. 'we can't force get bm vaccinated, reason wish vaccinated talk supervisor working home indefinitely'. Made lot antivaccers minutes sure. I'm not, even were, laws would still apply would still able go restaurant. COVID situation reaches lot ""I risk sick"".  agree, denying that. simply offering alternate view. Yes, recreation much important people’s lives. cruelly leaving *bored* old people get putter around reckless abandon!

I get really probably child, grow up. south, less 30% vaccinated open appointments everywhere, available anyone. 57% people 65 vaccinated state.

Overall, yes think fall 50-60%. Open appointments available even NYC now. starting hit Downvotes change reality. counter argument might. cannot seem manage formulate. fact least surprised. Disorganisation? Lack flexibility?

For example UK US, get vaccinated pharmacy. can't EU. Allowing pharmacists jabs, addition GPs mass vaccination centres, really speeds things up. it... vaccines lessen chance getting virus. ""eliminate"" chances. again, please tell said incorrect. think UK lot fairly loose restrictions, probably contributed perception bad here. suppose many countries range measure place once, we've never extreme options imposed like curfews people literally shut houses.

Plus varies. cities they've stuck like since March last year, rural areas smaller towns bit like normal life without pub. Lol, won't. Stop kidding yourself. sure three weeks second dose? I'm waiting long dine in. thread Indian B.1.617 Variant Wait Canada from?

I'm 21 year old predicted get first shot Mid May Mid June.

Ontario, BC, Alberta similar timelines don’t disagree vaccinations natural immunity endgame. mentioning people currently vaccinated need still follow precautions reach low covid spread. not, plenty vaccinated people still contract virus. speaking facts. would love see prosecutions around this. crime egregious (although counterfeiting government documents okay), would really rewarding see *sort people* shit locked up. vaccine fully approved FDA, we're going see nearly every university country require students. possible holdouts could see would extreme Christian colleges, make small percentage student population. 

This going big driver get people 18-early 20s age range vaccinated.  true good hear negative reactions, hiding motive moral. Eligibility kids isn’t due waiting line adults. They’re still waiting studies finish deem safe (12+ first). studies already done they’d likely eligible right now. also shut plants make vaccines right too.. So... risk blood clots Pfizer vaccine?

And what’s blood clot “window” J&amp;J vaccine...aka would someone know they’re clear? got first dose, know fair amount people frustrated trying get vaccine they're waiting right now. moved NJ trying get shot scheduled CVS/Walgreens/Rite Aid pain site scheduler rest state sucks. would imagine people would willing go get shot could drive CVS/Walgreens/Rite Aid mass vaccination spot go get shot instead dealing schedulers. Fauci says 'disturbing' people complete morons. asymptomatic patients (no fever, cough, nothing whatsoever slightly tired) covid stage 3 4.

Im confused this. outcome typically? Permanent lung damage? That’s good point. assuming opportunity date, maybe first earlier dates filled up. Hopefully so. let everyone get damn thing want mandatory travelling etc future. asshole, huh? Guess tracks. Saskatchewan fellow here. opening 18-29 planning available timeline too. Jesus dude chill out, stay anti vaxxer. Nobody forcing take vaccine least yet are. matter time required least one vaccines.

Also covid still exist, people still getting infected dying. halt vaccine bad anyone.  need it? assume gigantic number people get shots today.  
 
  
It'll probably day past weeks. limiting factor supply eligibility. state opened eligibility ago took 3 weeks get first dose trying hard could get one ASAP I'd done memorial day. Originally 4 weeks hour home managed find local appointment Pfizer therefore shaving 2 weeks timeline (1 schedule 1 faster second dose Pfizer). casually waiting likely still got in. higher profile vaccine sites (local health departments, anything vaccinefinder) booked out. warp always there. mean, that's rich coming ""health expert"" recently taken talking gun control things...

Yeah Fauci, wonder vaccine become political thing, thank part becoming way. Meanwhile Doug Ford uh taking time like douche soaking shit fuck sub nothing good comes Yes, disturbing used political gain. remember rolling onto shoulder night got shot cursing immediately lol Bottled oxygen supplier. great cumulatively seeing huge decrease deaths Covid UK, pumping Monday figures (historically lowest figure week) grab headlines risk putting people know better harm's way seems bit disingenuous. USA guarantee start seeing ""No Masks Allowed"" signs businesses. destigmatized anything people going die fighting masks Whole family first jab Thursday. Get mine Wednesday. Can't wait! ohh apologies misunderstood I'm sure getting messaging actual numbers official source, no.....none rest us are. would probably good idea understand 66% efficacy comes from. combination short long periods time, mild severe outcomes. long term protection serious outcomes closer 90-95% like vaccines. Lol Ok anyone may risk get vaccine themselves. Anyone chooses get vaccine puts risk (albeit tiny risk 70) Every Canadian getting first vaccine Canada Day. part. wore mask. got shots. I’m protected can’t spread it. Don’t shame bro. Hey, could, want always, rest life, wear mask around daughter around you. want either ever seeing other's faces ever. mean, masks minor inconvenience right? worth it.  rough fours next day. chance get vaccine now.

Literally today first day every American adult even eligible *first* shot. takes 5 6 weeks (following dose timetables) full protection. Slow roll there.

But point is, pandemics work individual level. never never will. People extremely social easily impressionable. need messaging saying OK stop wearing masks--not yet, lot people even first shot. ask MD? I'm northern VA trying find shots within 60 miles... Ahh, gotcha. /r/badlegaladvice little older would put private school could keep attending person many wife's coworkers ( works healthcare). quit career guess.

The American dream. Covid becoming comorbidity willful ignorance. Good luck...got last Saturday, Sunday little rough four hours. Logistics always going problem. got text message state got eligible 10 day wait till next appointment. say facility went great. even showed 15 minutes early within 5 minutes done. Exactly, im Hawaii. Got second shot right left. Wearing mask every where, don’t feel scared all. Almost every one I’ve talked vaccinated. Time start enjoying life’s again. local hospitals nowhere close full. Hospitals across country aren't, either. Pretending make people afraid, makes question lying.

Even Michigan, seeing biggest surge country, [at 80% capacity ICU 70% capacity total Teachers county aren’t even teaching person makes sense. checking multiple times day phase 1b+ believe teachers became eligible well high risk medical conditions. vaccine slots available compared others eligible exact time? basically memeing sports announcers say ""you hate see it"" someone fucks dude, haha I’m flexing immune system, I’m giving example normal immune system like. 

Also, objectively stating experience bragging?

If you’re getting sick every 15 months so, objectively weaker immune system, you’re right should’ve waited computer get scientific studies instead giving anecdotal evidence, I’m sorry that.

If friend who’s healthy weight tells weight compared height, bragging they’re obese? No. experimental designation vaccines, able sue manufacturer something goes wrong. worries gonna send vaccine someone third world country deserves more. Popular Twitch thing, lots people know Fiona Nova (streamer) years ago started recently.  talking someone today. think shortest gap doses supposed 17 days. recommend 21+ experience ask and/or insist they'll go short 17. Dilutes purpose alert?!? end pandemic people get asses gear get signed vaccine. Many people never need act urgently entire lives  restriction. 

Next say nowhere North America anyone really lockdown since people still free move No, still going give side eye

That would require going outside, something suspect even covid. Don’t talk getting them. It’s certainly possible, 30-40-some percent people report little side effects. Maybe you’ll camp! (I not) wiser cautious. hospitals still full Covid patients, still loads unvaccinated people spreading it, still clear dangerous vaccinated person exposed variants like Brazil South Africa partially evade immune response existing vaccines.

Why can't people wait another month two pandemic controlled? vaccines aren’t 100% effective, risk people genuinely can’t get vaccine medical reasons. Breakthrough cases rare happen. okay possibility transmitting Covid someone else? okay spreading someone spreads others?

Look, want. honest consequences are. Widespread vaccine acceptance protect everyone society waay 50-60%. personal decision to, marginal impact aggregate, part that. enough people share sentiment, slow recovery cost lives. shocking. went college back 2009 (albeit Yale) list vaccines needed prior semester starting. one shot required didn’t have, meningitis, offered separate area auditorium. non news story Yup! Amber alerts major weather alerts even news anymore? 

Antivaxers. 

It's going generate clicks plague walkers get super upset practice existed since decades. Schools generally want students vaccinated healthy. That's OK buddy, like lunatic conspiracy theorist hahahahaha known unknown long term effects covid factored decision well? Cool. I'm familiar logistics. know pipeline big. Say us got admit we're pretty damn good logistics. I'd argue homebound folks, even they're risk dying catch COVID, less risk catching first place spreading others.

We're past time focus at-risk need get everyone else vaccinated. going reach herd immunity wait every old person living mountain cabin vaccinated expanding eligibility. need vaccinate folks interacting people day every day.

One experimental Australian COVID vaccine candidate [caused false-positive HIV used one noninfectious component HIV virus. vaccine trials stopped soon became clear, even though posed risk participants itself.

The vaccines actually used association whatsoever HIV. leads believe

Yea, openly admitted speculation lmao.  Best news! ears listen so. Media Ah see   fifth sixth university announce mandatory vaccines without mentioning masks social distancing requirements buildings classes open full capacity.

There’s actually evidence waiting longer shots effective Shouldn’t headline say 200,000 instead 20,000 experience, nurses brightest. Unless they're dental nurses. be, sure hell love see it. many reasons get vaccinated even you’re young healthy. 

1. **You’re still risk**. Young people die get hospitalized. may also long-term side effects deal with. 

2. **Others can’t vaccinate put higher risk**. Kids people health conditions can’t vaccinate depend herd immunity. 

3. **Mutations**. spreads greater risk mutations evade vaccines deadly.

4. **Prolonging pandemic**. Shutdowns, masking, social distancing, things wrecked past year risk continuing allow continue spread.

Not saying Israel angel. Obviously aren't. I'd rather side million times.  CDC fine pregnant breastfeeding women getting authorized shots. studying though.

Sorry rant. Uh, though? Merck cancelled vaccine program realized pfizer/moderna/jnj far ahead pivoted making treatment drugs, tested now. could see COVID-19 getting lumped category future, I'd worried long still warrants separate entry. exact position? would think otherwise? literally campaigned getting vaccine out.   got second Moderna dose 4/8 around 2:00 afternoon. count, tomorrow afternoon 4/20 full 12 days past shot start going back “normal” - e.g., get haircut, go eat, etc. accurate, worth waiting 14 full days longer? I’m really worried anti-vaxxers going cause variants. Might helpful mention free...  Good bot. lol, guy calling others ""eurotrash"" perfectly acceptable.

Guess americans really insecure,not surprising since scream communism amything thay may benefit daughter nurse well fully vaccinated. continue take precautions health care workers. takes effort caring us. protect Covid, emotional invisible load health care workers carried throughout pandemic. efforts you. Take care. age groups 1%? many ended hospitalized? exact point article. Ummm... Healthy grown adults getting sick 3 days due side effects.

No, don’t know yet whether vaccines safe 4 year old children. risk getting COVID might jeopardize entire career? doubt that, mean anti-vaxxer literally. think way talking may well take vaccine since apparently change anything. got mine Publix past Friday. Second dose mid May. Thank you! know right! Per capita, Canada administered doses countries Europe Vaccines exported US :

less 1 milion

Vaccines exported EU:

More 110 Milions.

Embarassing AHAH Sorta hard live life half everything closed. point getting vaccine get Covid. Getting things back normal happen enough people received vaccine. 

If people realize Covid could potentially put hospital weeks, that's get vaccine, definitely going reason. And, people changed lives anyways. main issue ""wait see"" large enough percentage population fails vaccinate, large enough group people keep passing covid around FOREVER.

It's flu still around mutating hundred years Spanish flu pandemic. ability vaccinate population stop it. kept spreading mutating several times year, we'll never rid it. want covid thing, power stop dead like polio smallpox. think fine. Also congrats worry things like \~2 weeks :) I'm really sure getting pessimism from. Yea region currently sucks, perfect storm defiance skepticism ""system"". Florida actually bright spot though right now, great terms number shots given respective population, trend up, meaning number getting shots week trended up. 

NY trending slightly down, given least 1 shot 40% eligible population. number slowed bit number still going up. 

And good, businesses mandating vaccines good gets people stop acting like petulant children right thing. I'm saying governments really good implementing rules really bad getting rid them. bars go - they're **closed**. person goes walk night likely 'close contact' police gather around them. Forbid random stops lone individuals, guess - chance transmission. female, would pass AZ honestly. really would. take risk safer alternatives there. outdoor plumbing though hesitate AZ seems risk almost non-existent. Pfizer use Op Warp speed money development first. business helped cash flow guaranteed orders they're large pharma. always working it. also make money pandemic since we're sort stuck Yeah he's probably lost rights cause people Alaska I'm sure like that. really encouraging. One thing I've noticed 9 top 10 states least 1 dose northeast. Haha, 29 year old male every time happens feel same. wife come second shot driving home passing probably wasn’t smartest idea.    let get vaccines *can* teach person again... that's goal. Parents need get back work. Yep. 246 children dead covid. We've lost many people pandemic die. get point, lacks compassion, need ever. vaccine rates rise safer, normal way life returns, kinds arguments tinged bitterness. Comment chains comparing one pile bodies another pile bodies. forgotten numbers children?

We've *all* hard time. lot us shitty time. tough truth-telling sit rattling numbers dead kids. cold callous handwaving. Regardless views opinions how, why, extent restrictions... still find compassion looking experience. think better kind cold calculation. discussing save lives, level 'acceptable losses'. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* quite. statistics lower Mondays fewer deaths reported Sundays. Still impressive, that's bit misleading Yeah, worry whole areas, like rural south, stay 50% vaccinated troubling level infections summer. But, people get vaccinated. we're ""everybody really wanted one one literally walk without appointment today get one"" point, think justify society wide restrictions. fit category discussion here. We're talking people unwilling get you. clearly plans get it. hate you. fine 3 weeks minimum. recommended that's tested past experience told wait least long way get results quicker. However max much later India 250k day country massive, densely packed, poor population. 344 million people India, roughly population United States, access toilets. That's COVID spreading. COVID would spread country conditions. 

America conditions. third Americans fully vaccinated, half partially vaccinated, already 85 - 95 percent effective preventing transmission 100% effective preventing death. Americans also able social distance necessary. None us live one room dirt floor 10 people. 

We get kicked back Africa level hospital care worst well over. - 7 year old wants vaccinated. want baby vaccinated enough words express desire self. Best guess far sometime 2022, nobody really knows.

When babies young vaccines typically nothing, good argument never reach point. wait see trails say though. Strange mention reason. Wonder why.



Because live UK experience statutory sick pay system. wild type first wave easier young. Now, lots young people succumbing mutant variant(s). Conspiratorial nonsense. would government want artificially decrease GDP? think people would follow mandate people vaccinated case counts low danger rising? many circumstances would mandate even apply conditions?

I'm vaccinated. pretty much need wear mask I'm stores can't anything took anyway. Seriously, what's danger here? got 2nd shot today! :) Considering month ago well agree. reason detected enrollment covid study A&amp;M. People seriously overestimate variant testing here. remember reading scientists opinion last summer one worst outcomes vaccines work worked extremely rare serious event found trial show up. 


Why? 


Fuels antivax sentiment, regulatory authorities public health said vaccine rushed tested appropriately, yet promptly reverse causing chaos. 


Many countries risk benefit correctly, erring side caution people would die COVID. 


Richer countries access vaccine would pass vaccines poorer countries vaccine hesitancy already high would fuel idea 2 tier world, many poorer countries would refuse vaccine allowed richer countries even though risk benefit clearly favour taking vaccine. 


It's also sad happened AZ J&amp;J make bulk production poorer countries. 


It's well good USA saying they'll stick mRNA 2 billion + doses pledged COVAX (the main way poorest countries get vaccine) 40 million mRNA (Pfizer), AZ J&amp;J make half. literally can't use vaccines. 


I honestly think fallout set back vaccination campaigns poor countries decades even unrelated vaccines. Things like Polio eradication may happen next decade expected well others. selfish ask can’t fully vaccinated people freedoms.  Wasn’t end game vaccinated protected. that’s end game That’s cool, really hoping I’d get sticker something nope :( Good question. I'm gonna see get Drs. Lucy McBride Monica Ghandhi answer live vaccine Q&amp;A tomorrow - See Dr. Lucy McBride's FB page interested.

Thinking I'm thinking friends got J&amp;J vaccine, particularly immunocompromised friend almost went blind last year condition. much difference efficacy matter? Expecting answer framework risk tolerance, act accordance however comfortable.... something evidence/data/confidence/uncertainty. try asking boss could take hour get vaccinated? defending israeli occupation settlement policy?! Could never Lol, yes, sounds silly. would genuinely happy feel weather day two, means I'm part bring us closer herd immunity end pandemic. disturbing read about. India seemed well earlier pandemic.

I hope get ahead surge fashion beat thing. I, ton people, want know actual number/threshold “enough” Even asymptomatic ones? assume suddenly become symptomatic.... guy liar, live BC, hospital staff eligible since Feb. Stop making stuff spewing CDC's chart COVID hospitalizations. They're literally third January peak. Canada: vaccine!
Bureaucrats: Let's put 25% storage, ""Reserve"". nobody use them. fine conspiracy theorist still really get shot ASAP. I'd assume going decide reopen largely based vaccination numbers, need every non-conspiracy theorist getting can. going get eventually get Suck buttercup. anxiety change reality. continue seeing parents unvaccinated small amount time get variant kills anyway. ""anxiety"" actively taking away lives. 31 million infected, 10% hospitalized point infection. numbers readily available anyone internet access. think big deal.because seriously hit anyone know. Good you. Enjoy bubble lasts. wonder much higher number would without Brexit.

It's actually decent question depends belonging EU would impacted UKs decisions supplies (For former, different countries seem different strategies e.g.whether use AZ vaccine).

One thing seems worked well ""12 weeks doses"" strategy. openly admit extremely sceptical diverging manufacturers instructions - seems major impact. fuck talking about? live BC, hospital staff eligible covid vaccine since February. agree would protect others get vaccine protect others?

[I Know Explain Care convince do. said yourself; vaccine protects others. isn’t enough reason get vaccine nothing say change mind... ""Discriminatory"" would unprecedented wave anti-transgender voter suppression bills moving state legislatures across country. bills attempting erase transgender people, make LGBTQ people second class citizens, deny marginalized communities right way, also largely religious people problem case LGBT rights, sure thank well.  IDK, NY 8300 cases Saturday, sign slowing down, even 50% adults vaccinated. That’s glorious malicious compliance. enough people get vaccinated reach herd immunity drop restrictions people complaining about.

We could drop right vaccine passport existed could flash id prove 2 weeks post vaccine thus need wear mask something. (well, assuming easy verify id fake)

There good reasons fear vaccine passport. (paranoid, still reasonable). Fear mRNA vaccines warranted anymore (it would reasonable January want data, vaccines issues worry about) Last Monday got second Moderna. Tuesday night fever went away. Tuesday afternoon started fiver headache Thursday morning. fell 100% Friday. Hell week, headache knocked down. helps federal government actually cares now. Got mine Saturday 😍 almost certainly employers’ fault. people don’t PTO sick days available, come work sick. people living paycheck paycheck can’t afford miss hours.  This! Make sure you’re free day well Yeah that’s super important note. people life don’t seem aware that, thanks spreading word 👍🏼 madmaxthatsbait.gif “But actually, I'm kind looking forward brief side effects, them. almost like rite passage”. &lt;—- da fuck? Lol

Hopefully right long term effects. Guess see. Take india example. They’re getting 250k day numbers right now. Meaning they’re looking 25k people needing hospital beds future. mean? 

America total 100k hospital beds. 

The danger racking covid. Everyone needing hospital beds time. hospitals overwhelmed. Non covid patients go also get infected. Healthcare workers get infected. Hospitals collapse. happens? 

Pregnant? Car crash? Overdose? Appendicitis? Cancer? Tumors? Organ transplant? 

What happens America kicked back Africa level hospital care? planning human challenge trials unvaccinated people vaccinated cohorts step really. FDA EUA took weeks last time. reasonable think Pfizer Moderna receive full FDA approval early summer. Canada started vaccinations December. WTF happened?! Even India May 1!!! Absolutely fantastic news! need less divisive language positivity promotion around vaccination.

...and everything else, matter. 

Too many people eager sort people easily-labeled bins. question sorters, get thrown another bin.  lol trump helping‽ nah want dad nowhere near politics. say that... they’ve said vaccines good least 6 months isn’t data yet formally conclude they’re effective longer (given studies started limited time ago). 

More info long term efficacy available get first vaccines given people. Please, please, please look getting vaccinated. do, fellow 0-year-old? Forgot /s freak Masks proven drastically reduce spread virus indoors. 

There outdoor mask requirement anywhere know of. Maybe festival concert. need stop flights absolutely essential.  Doublespeak again!!! love it. funny feeling already dealing problem well pandemic anyway. studies shown longer gap potentially could effective. vacation planned reason needing additional immunity sooner completely fine wait 1 week. Potentially. tested yet, I'm highly suspicious inherited condition genetic affects connective tissue, potentially including heart. Also since many unknowns Covid, feel better try best keep safe. I'll relax bit husband fully vaccinated (which next month woo) get sick, least we'll able take care properly without getting sick ourselves.

Even though know far year ago, feel like everyone's still flying seat pants hate uncertainty. Yeah downvotes flat weird. Nobody seems actually argue holding AZ vaccines never used good. like told country obviously wrong guess? 

I'm also Canadian, even selfish thing I'd happy gave literally anyone else. loan deal also included Mexico desperately needs vaccines, send them! No. solution happens go along Biden outlawing legal guns. Biden without raging Twitter going golfing helping family members make billions.

Bit soreness moving arm, slight fatigue, that's it. Lasted even day. won’t find 40+ vaccine shopping.  Appointments booked. problem 55+ fairly small cohort thought next line mass vaccination sites.  That’s wrong (with priority groups don’t see happening general population 59 least month) heard several friends neighbours. 40+ huge cohort know it’s AZ Pfizer/Moderna June. That’s easy choice vaccines eliminate risk death/hospitalization.

You said this. flatly true. Ummm.... might slow variants week. Maybe.     Sucks them. Forget economy. Young people ones *spreading* it. truly wanted save lives give vaccine people spreading virus, people sitting home. Everything single response pandemic optics, actually stopping spread.

In mathematical terms, R value virus needs 1. R value amongst 65+ already likely lower 1, 25- likely several times higher. vaccinated individuals needed whilst ignoring impact society whole. *very* ""conservative"" approach. 80% capacity big deal? serious? exactly I'm hard US personally. money means always difficult get part prove it. region? see cases past 14 days. Well extreme short term risk seem range anywhere side effects dibilating nauseau couple days, would like risk possible.

Short-medium term risks seem bad moment, good.

Long terms risks (2+ years) compeltely unknown point, thats worried about. really really hope none. Imagine 4th July year?

It's going one ages. Idk anyone able answer loved ID still old state, live partner (we married..yet) child, dont name papers showing im resident here. still get vaccination? need go chain getting married, new ID &amp; name papers (bills/house)? Im hoping sort answer..thanks advance. would anyone even prove residency? Lots resident americans single piece id.  got 40+ Ontario boomers playing "" choose vaccine "" instead taking get expire opened age group bit.. fml lol yeah think grand scheme things terms herd immunity, hospitalizations deaths, people don’t want aren’t really people really worry about. hope you’re right change mind. covid thrilled get shot could peace mind immunity would strong possibly could tell everyone get vaccine. Even made appointments people act like can’t find one. data shows people immune hardly spread all. joined 12 minutes ago! think agree there's ""majority"" kind masking debate; either one persuasion other. lean towards Fl Tx remove mandates July 4th, states like California continue masking policies fall, point handing reins local health jurisdictions craft rules. counties may require masking indoors crowded packed venues, proprietors screening vaccinations/negative tests, others may decide implement sites outbreaks. see guys deal jealousy friends getting vaccine you? 
I don’t want give many details reveal location, vaccine deployment area chaos.I dealing rejected appointments despite meeting criteria, yet friends mine booked despite risk young work home way government wants schedule vaccines town. Meanwhile go work every day 3 close calls. I’m happy friends feel despair myself. cool, work stop people need money. Also work places frown taking sick day. also drill kids school attendance Sure, lot people immunity. phrasing ""declared herd immunity"" strange me. fact that? going continue precautionary measures like mask wearing, etc (assuming ever did) going figure vaccinated folks heavy lifting act pre-pandemic way? chance get vaccine now.

What’s stopping Biden administration loaning us another 5 million, cost themselves, earning tons good Canadians? don’t understand others posting topic getting downvotes. college professor refused reschedule exam *on fucking 9/11*.  vaccination site bunch stuff saying come recent symptoms recent positive test. common? example rather actual supply. saying even supply jumped already done vital part. Wrong. mean I’m gonna get matter appreciate heads I’ll probably put ass ideal, there's also plenty evidence people infected immune time, almost certainly contributing spread. They're also group likely get shot later, they've seen friends family get growing third arm.  ""open everyone 18"" comes fine print - 50% manufactured vaccines continue go Central government 45+ 50% left hunger games states bid buy. people complain vaccine shortage central government calmly pointing back state governments. Strategic political move. CNN said lead author contradicted them. true I’m taking grain salt, would mean previously exposed even immune vaccine? wonder potential booster shots received, exposed via vaccine symptoms (if?) get boosters. place among friends family. people know got vaccine one way another either work health condition, getting ""extra shot"" somewhere simply lying application form.

I know people simply tried, they're ""waiting turn"", nervous whatever reason, bare minimum register state county waiting turn come.

In experience, motivated get shot willing plug away different web sites maybe drive hour two problem. think people wear sidewalks courtesy it’s enforced. like grocery stores, example. two weeks don’t think choice wrong! Getting vaccine help entire planet! K

edit: seems like hit nerve lolol Yes vaccines aren’t perfect testing important numbers really nose dive. could even remotely perceived bad thing lol. Well pretty wild provincial governments resorting this. feds clearly failed procuring vaccine medical system peril attempt reduce strain medical system met protests, making problem worse. That's really hope closer 60-70% enough. Things seem going great Israel that's are.

I'm totally aware never eradicate I'm absolutely favor enforcing kind ""zero covid"" policy - would require insane lockdown people allowed leave homes, even come back due international travel such.

What favor masks. Pretty much everything go back normal people wear masks public case numbers drop vaccinations hit critical point. people feel that's much affront ""liberty"", they're better anti-vaxxers. Harrisburg. think waited 2 minutes thawing bikes. anyone getting JJ shot (I don’t know it’s reissued not) expect feel like mild flu couple days. don’t get side effects, that’s great! do, don’t panic. wife fevers, chills, aches, headache several days after. 

But I’ll take discomfort days work like, getting Covid. Probably politics, messaging government officials non-committal. public health people media busy telling people negatives vaccine instead promoting benefits public health. coronavac Sputinik? supply chain amazing 200 million doses administered.

Uptake high critical demographics. take years untill regions vaccinated. one scream panic, taking lightly advisable. Adenovector vaccines developed since 1980s. Ebola vaccine first; fact there’s previously successful rabies vaccine fully approved use animals. mind ask university? current major restriction states capacity limits closely enforced masks, strictly enforced. CNN said blood clots reported Pfizer Moderna. false.

J&amp;J correct stated reported covid vaccines. I'll try anything, thank you! desire save children's lives somehow disturbing you? sure, disagreeing link heavily investigated. pointing math lineup Oxford paper claimed seen 2021 database. cynical side feels like trying slip mRNA vaccines cause CVTs almost much AZ vaccines, disguise saying Covid's worse. one second thought said vacation Fear mongering. Ignore.  can't fatal... kids would dying like crazy lol. happen they'll side effects. mRNA can't kill you. literally part body right now. Yea it’s nothing bad annoyance wanna get work done. guess that’s I’m telling Reddit lol Come Lebron.... co-workers 16yo son got vaccinated last week still deemed qualified (34yo man). I'm plenty happy wait turn, I've felt rush, patience waning. little read 2, Sputnik seems better. expert though. Go get shots filthy animals that’s “technically true”, Pfizer others done studies noticed you’re something like 80% protected couple weeks first dose would saved 100,000 lives easy approved distributed scale October, ""months"" approval distribution brand-new virus would godsend. ""Weeks"" could probably realistically new variant something already vaccine against, using something like abbreviated approval process new flu strains year.

I agree mRNA tech already at-scale save tremendous amounts time. Hopefully start using mRNA-based flu vaccines, infrastructure already running next time. glad country thought could use EU vaccines without EU.

Still amazed rollout US. thought missed opportunity place orders soemthing like last year. No. whole incident swine flu vaccine, they’ve got pretty high vaccine hesitancy. imagine, time around administered vaccines **know** chance severe side effects. low chance, still, side effects common demographic least likely severe reaction covid begin with. people getting vaccinated themselves, common good. They’re ones taking risk vaccine. government kept administering vaccine people, knowing risk, next time pandemic comes around, people would trust government try get people take new vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy bad enough swine flu vaccine, people say fluke, one time thing, many still willing take leap faith get vaccinated. shit happens two pandemics? government continues administer risky vaccine even learning risk? They’d totally utterly fucked next pandemic. Better wait get access vaccine doesn’t side effects, least demographic doesn’t much gain vaccinated. understand (not sure country countries) elderly still getting vaccine, makes sense. Yeah Moderna's second dose rough! space heater, motrin, lots water! took work slept day Love optimistic comment, agree. effect. Many states opened everyone help larger web spread. Things going gradually get better. We're beginning end. Yale going requiring masks physical distancing fall, right? everyone's going vaccinated, need that. got vaccine NY. live still state ID. showed ID didn’t bat eye ask verifying info. Ooof doesn’t bode well me. I’m day 3 since vaccine still feel like crud. :(. Possibly work unrepresentative sample exactly it. currently Canada access AZ, case numbers skyrocketing. due age restrictions AZ seeing hundreds appointments going unfilled vaccines expiring due people worried getting AZ shot. today they’ve lowered age limit 40+ thankfully age group snapped available slots many health units. aim study.

Exactly, that's CNN reporting: J&amp;J claimed particular study showed blood clots reported, didn't, even consider matter. CNN reporting correct..."
