0,2021-11-23," few. baffles people get it... believe they're honest. common sense. Basic logic. Really really basic real life experience shit. Oh god. Lol üòÖüò¢ ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ Unfortunately. academia taught anything: there‚Äôs always gonna people make ask, ‚Äúhow earth get a/an [Insert degree]?‚Äù use ‚Äúinsertions‚Äù title makes sound like someone telling beginning joke  That's brought up. doctors hiding working treatment new expensive pills, use dexamethasone. bunch cat used take it. course I'm going take prophylactic, ever need take it, here. also take consulting doctor. I'm feeling little better now. I've broken (and removed) tooth grinding cracked another. I'm pretty mellow person IRL, like spirited discussions always good spirits people enjoy speaking to, ended pretty ugly shouting match stranger spouting conspiracy bullshit... Another friend mine used shy mellow actively approaching people behaving antisocially public transit can't tolerate anymore.

Idk point is. vent, guess. feel unwell. want live around people care even mildly inconvenient. know call med-school graduate lowest grades?  Thank you. I'm really applied statistic. I'm modelling inference therefore mathematical side statistics (doing course right categorial analysis).  know basics applied like SRS, stratified, anova experiments 2 2 contingency tables.

However I'll probably go ML/AI/DS quant route much lucrative biostatistics. CDC Stay home 14 days **last contact** person COVID-19. (emphasis additional useful guidance page whether need quarantine circumstances end quarantine early. We're giving samples?  Dexamethasone also actually used treatment too. don‚Äôt know alternative treatments pulled from. saw doctor writing short term really high dose SSRI covid once. Well flat earth astronaut. went well expect. Time lose licenses case person get back you, generally tooth pulled bone graft performed. heals, post put bone jaw. heal 6+ months, crown fitted post.

It's long process even healthy. conditions complicate process even longer. used to, lazy skallywag said I'd taken much blood one time never came back.  America. üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ

 Sincerely, Texas Yes I'm sure time posted comment ran Regeneron clinic. anything saved lives that. stuff bull hockey. * Shocked Pikachu face * mean like dirt cheap dexamethasone? literally steroid reduces inflammation, used specifically lung issues? get think powers hiding working meds.  Exactly. know couple thinking getting vaccinated kept putting off. eventually got covid also diligent wearing masks. started feeling better, went vacation another state walking around large crowds Gatlinburg Pigeon Forge still positive covid tests.  Meanwhile, Florida enjoying massive 50% California per capita COVID cases per day present - vs study read said ivermectin could lead fertility issues. Hopefully get idiots hospital one delaying cancer treatments orthopedic surgeries beds available. 16 months ivermectin, still caught covid huh? Hmmm. think doctor would realize work. Manifesto means public declaration political position. dismiss political document media outlets made associate ""Manifesto"" irrational nut jobs. ‚ÄúI never felt healthier life.‚Äù Dr Boros put that, obit Or, buy directly organic farmers. went CVS got day appointment. However, I'm Alabama folks believe vacation anyway ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è might gotten lucky. Ya know, that‚Äôs probably true. Unfortunately, dumb*sses problem spreading it, super entitled. there‚Äôs double edge ‚Äî second time ( ) today. Nurses, teachers, first responders, home healthcare, receptionist doctors offices...I mean damn. puts everyone edge. helpful, thank you!   mean, that's GOT fuck gut bacteria, right? see requirements annoying, think answer 'no requirements ever!!!'.

For example, although get air sick, masks make much worse me, see wearing mask airplane may go away time soon; ton people small room several hours ... also see international requirements testing may stay, although hope make vaccinated test (I \*want\* vaccine passports :). 

I think mask requirements time good measure either; although wear almost everywhere, wear restaurant I'm going eat there, example.

I assume (hope? :) varying requirements (masks high transmission, example) figure out, I'm sure cases little much depending :) Holy shit - covid aside, article states: 

 Molnupiravir is‚Äîand likely remain‚Äîeffective major coronavirus variants. fact, least lab, works number RNA viruses besides sars-CoV-2, including Ebola, hepatitis C, R.S.V., norovirus. 

EBOLA!!! Like real, that‚Äôs dropped article casually Ebola fucking 90% mortality rate.
That HUUUUUUGE NEWS. laws Idaho, tested positive Covid, since 60..the doctor gave ivermectin‚Ä¶like standard practice‚Ä¶

(They also went separate clinic got monoclonal antibodies, feel like they‚Äôll say ivermectin helped them‚Ä¶) Definitely Florida probably give doctor year award instead pulling license. ‚ÄúBut break leg, they‚Äôre gonna put down.‚Äù Dr. Boros veterinarian chance? drugs problem. ones come need taken within days symptoms order effective. time lot people sick, damage done virus already. Mind bottling.

/r/BoneAppleTea ;)   This, idea real not, felt rough, taste got subdued smell, body chills, head ache. like well go real covid tests found. next morning like dream. felt fine, coffee coffee, English spread English spread‚Ä¶.. sat shock happened. Friday Sunday felt like wham bam gone moment. 


Can prove self rona, nope. keep level boosted / vax / feel like live life fine care. crazy fast bug knew fended due haste.    Nefarious Doctor Fauci paid claim make anti-vaxxers look bad! mean don‚Äôt blood boy?! dunno, seem able get away things short drunkeness operating theater. little cases summer 2020 massive spike summer 2021 huge surge area. yeah, apparently seasonal. factors apparently don‚Äôt yet know contribute rises cases. Funny enough comment this. Bactrim literally coming 100 months cystic acne. thing ever worked. Doctor derm lowered dose minimum effective dose stayed better part decade. Every year get blood work done double check done anything nasty kidneys. Every check see still need it. 32 still yep. Sucks, point minor risk low dose, long-term antibiotic use became easy trade deal shit anymore.


By far worst effects constant nuking gut bacteria. take prebiotics things fine tbh dose low hardly big issue anyways. hospital wife works mandated. Oct 31 dead line. extended deadline Jan 1 25% short nursing staff. hospital staff around 50% vaccinated numbers seen news letter pay check.

Half floor wife works quit deadline. asthma flares cold. piece clothing going warm lungs. 60% may majority, still leaves like 100MM people unvaccinated COVID yet. Since going go away time soon (read: herd immunity happen 60%), think reasonably assume good chunk unvaccinated folks either catch COVID eventually come senses get vaccine- even account vaccinated people catching COVID, too.

So, extension, we're probably due spike far worse January 2021.

I think say cases ""horrifyingly rise"" literally anyone math could see coming.  I'm pharma industry, though one vaccine manufacturers. work vaccines past. yes, general applied biostats, clinical trials. obviously know something it, area interest you? Where‚Äôs HCA connection? guess.... I'd still say wildly hypocritical claim something absolute truth (creationism) fearful discuss healthcare setting.... girlfriend showing symptoms last Friday. Didn‚Äôt get tested til Sunday came back positive. took test day came back negative. immediately left house go quarantine mothers house spare bedroom basement. question is, would exposure Friday day got test long need quarantine take another test see come quarantine. Thanks advance!

I add haven‚Äôt kissed whole time. slept parents 2 nights slept bed Saturday night. sure statistic correct, but‚Ä¶ live near place takes people planes lets parachute down. accidents year. So, close enough confirmed me. Hopefully put Disney+ too. recommend site numbers. add delete however many countries like change metrics. shows many things like current cases, kinds vaccination rates (1 shot, fully, booster), hospital patients, ICU patients, Covid deaths, excess mortality, etc. something discuss doctor though CDC generally recommends using antibody tests measure immunity determine need vaccine. Much, much soon..   Definitely not. Well, wrong time, once. become meme Germany assume opposite says actually correct. personally well think they're quarantining. Maybe insist everyone taking rapid test? option could eat outside open windows get ventilation. South Park? would agree. saying goes, ""what call doctor barely passes medical school?""

""A doctor"" Imagine live country believes Vampires, read anonymous article United States declaring vaccine turns Undead...What would *you* do?. get colder much, people still spend lot time outdoors. agree holiday gatherings likely significant culprit. Uh... soon? like fire fighters attending pro arsonist meeting, somehow fire breaks perish. mean ETF wrong people. several hundred employees fired.  Oh say, took several days start feeling sick ""exposed"" (within 6 feet 15 minutes). first contact symptomatic 2 Fridays ago. tested last Wednesday negative. tested past Sunday positive. several days exposure actually sick, take mean get close someone sick.

I'm sure ok! remember stayed masked get vaccinated. something like ""A guy got hit bus. He's dead now"". Can't remember exact wording, impression gave something like ""people die, happens, get it"". anti-vaccine spokespeople come getting sick recanted said? I‚Äôve seen stories random people guys shuffle away embarrassment what? makes perfect sense saying really care, u?  site also shows fall death numbers since 5th November. compare current death numbers countries, deaths still very, many. Recently lot articles site Germany's Austria's problems, death numbers still far, far away Romania. Romania still far EU European average. Ah crap I'm dating school teacher. Wish luck! like official Ireland closing pubs 'most transmission homes, businesses' well, um, ya?  Instructions unclear. Dick stuck ivermectin. Send help. US require truckers crossing US border fully vaccinated, starting * Biden Administration require truck drivers cross US borders fully * mandate go effect January 22 pertain essential * American Trucking Association warned vaccine mandate truckers serious US already facing unprecedented supply chain disruptions delays due many factors, including significant labor shortages, production shutdowns, shortage raw materials, pent-up consumer demand,"" ATA said letter administration October.

Unreal. Everyone mask cases, recommended 3rd shot reduce cases. know predict get complications. COVID seems reliably seasonal Europe, there's much bigger difference infections summer winter.

Look historical COVID case charts closely follow seasonal trend. Delta variant little impact summer (despite widespread global circulation), cases near record-high. Still isn‚Äôt effective rapid testing available everyone. pills won‚Äôt mean much takes close 5 days test results. want grandchildren.

Take. Vitamin D.  Agreed. I'll add another likely variable play actually UK's extended duration doses. supported clinical data time, conducting amounted large scale involuntary trial UK population, learned extra time Dose 1 Dose 2 seems help. also possible reason Moderna's vaccination regimen appears slightly effective Pfizer.

I think AZ's CEO making insinuation interviews borderline unethical, given lack supporting data (and presence data internal UK runs directly counter claim making). always someone else's fault, someone else's responsibility. idea long term risks Covid are, it‚Äôs clotting disease. many viruses cause us problems road post infection. weirdly lot diseases vax kids also didn‚Äôt cause ton deaths still vax them! Sadly, expect lesson winter learned well last winter's lesson.

The problem also directly invest development, manufacturing, distribution. Thailand, Astrazeneca vaccines manufactured government-owned biopharma company. country Taiwan, government invested company developed local vaccine, get payout it. Sputnik, Sinopharm, Sinovac, developed state-funded pharmas.

You using words specific industry definitions without understanding mean. Medical research synonymous basic science research early-stage drug discovery. Research synonymous drug development. Distribution pharmaceuticals even done pharma companies often-times pharma companies actually pay government provide service. fact paper sent argues clearly public-private sectors intertwined researchers actually get payout money re-invested research paying salary scientists.

So think parents gone thoughts last 300 years, that's comfort.

An 2007 takes Franklin's situation uses illustrate making decision trees analyze probabilities outcomes combinations Decisions medicine would easy consisted choice: take treatment live; die. Unfortunately, Franklin's choice simple. Franklin's son could die either choice made. risk smallpox ‚Äúdo nothing‚Äù made sense. Inoculation became relevant option smallpox arrived town. key decision probability Franklin's son would become infected natural way. risk high enough, point inoculation 2% mortality would justified.

With 15% mortality rate smallpox infections periodic recurring outbreaks throughout 1700s, came conclusion odds becoming infected dying much greater odds dying inoculation. COVID, numbers deaths ill effects disease major side effects vaccines much smaller around smallpox, odds similarly favor vaccination. far experience too. ICU currently zero vaccinated covid patients. OMG. ""anti-vaccine"" summit. can't convince people get vaxed, least convince meet large quantities anti-vaxers? WTF?

'Cutting meat packing line' another good look this. everybody knows understands vaccine, even perfect, help people. fundamental principle medical field ? help save lives? though? true vaccinated people unvaccinated get admitted hospital. mainly elderly.

Can vaccines help end nonsense?  think find incredibly small cadre people. possible covid make dislike specific food? Two months ago got covid made lose sense smell recovered senses two weeks. since recently started able stand onions all. Like group, assholes likely loudest bunch. Agreed! say though germaohobe still continue bleach available surfaces deep clean carpets darned air touches everything! husband upstairs isolating since Sunday. tell house like huge lab experiment. air filtration going, uv lighting, and, course, bleach, rubbing alcohol hydrogen peroxide spray within reach times.  I‚Äôm asked think acceptable number deaths, usually think number zero, tempted increase number accommodate people like you. 26.5% sure high number, due availability self tests, numbers rocketed countries PCR tests taken confirm self test positive.   I've eased see people one want put mine respect, case immune compromised. generally keep business people case brings peace mind. hard really. 

But huge risk situations nice able take finally.

With situation always changing, many vaccinated people tiring masks, wonder coming years like. impossible anything like US states without fundamentally breaking country. Despite people recently talking ""crossing state lines"" that's meaningful, practical demarcation states would require economy shut governmental manpower shifted create kind internal border patrol. 

International borders theoretically already system control set up. Adding vaccine requirement paperwork already required huge difference. course effect legal entrance. people refuse vaccines think immigrants problem. Airlines insurance companies need require vaccines.  Thank kind insightful words. love husband dearly attributed actions actually sick. one could get him, one nurses doctor's office talked isolation necessary. apparently told everything isolating since then. say really really sick, symptoms.

 vaccine, scared him. last 2 years spent lot time internet following political stuff. I'm political person all, I'm common sense prefer crafts, gardening cooking listening people's opinions. I'm vaccinated hoping make minimal symptoms. far asymptomatic pray every minute stay way. 

So anyone fence getting vaccinated, please please please it. Science reliable opinion every time. suffering point wanting die, today day 7 improved. loved ones pets suffer along get sick assure you, able take care yourself. Yes, possible, everyone developing symptoms isolate, call doc test get PCR tested might feel silly comes back negative thats far better spreading around. situation last week.  People understand US downvote you. Like... guys, done states would shut country. Imagine would happen northeast alone. medical treatment denied unvaccinated. brought yourself, deal yourself. sentiment unvaccinated death anymore Delicious.    Yep. bet vaccinated everything else decided throw tantrum covid.  situation insane

starting today, (fully vaccinated) get rapid test done go gym. expense. 85% ICU occupancy area unvaccinated. ""talks"" vaccine mandates

in words: im getting punished assholes assholes. people denied kind medical treatment save job

they could also choose get fired. Last day, 107,192 tests SARS-CoV-2 performed. ""Our observations show reaching peak fourth wave,"" Deputy Health Minister Waldemar Kraska told Interia.

I expert positivity rate 26.5% total tests conducted, mean true number infections much, much higher? determine peak near? based upon day day increase? Netherlands agree hope get fired go broke ASAP.

0 tolerance unvaccinated assholes anymore, enough enough. either get vaccinated leave society People underestimate power social media. lot people start like bombarded one flavor news slowly pushed one way. hostile online discussion seals bubbles, people can't understand much anything anyone that's largely like already.

Yeah that‚Äôs pretty much mean disgustingly profit-driven; course companies chasing profit there‚Äôs difference mention.

I‚Äôve seen chart - it‚Äôs hard avoid Nestl√©! kids majority people hospitals, buy excuse either.

This shows understand notably includes **children** **have driving** infections also **breakthrough infections families**.

(Emphasis mine)

Children get infected school, get seriously sick, infectious. stay families without mask extended periods time. parents grandparents get exposted virus repeatedly long times. 

That leads breakthrough infections hospital stays them, kids. They've profit-driven anyone, lots meat alternative products health foods people like go meatless owned evil food corporations. start good smaller biz really trying right, usually get bought Nestle, Unilever, etc. turning profit. Quite started big names labelled like quaint little biz cares.

About 2 decades ago, maybe 3, someone put chart brands actually owned each, incredible. 4 companies owned vast majority. understanding (not expert), consolidation risen interim, like industries.

All industries profit-driven, that's fine, that's literally point company existing. Wanting make profit healthy ways vs raw greed fast buck regardless consequences problem see today across many industries. Ebola massive I‚Äôd also happy pill RSV quite dangerous babies toddlers.      Yes, Romania government seems faked data (willingly not) deaths (some 4000 deaths last November December magically appeared April)

That said, one person know works gathering reporting covid data, June-July many days zero cases counties.

The problem is, Government thought insist vaccination measures late - June even announced ""we beat covid"" now, number cases deaths started shrink, already starting relax. So, goodbye vaccination.     thought Europe actually scanning them. 

They \*should\* scanned every time locations actually scan it. consistent enough. COVID doesn‚Äôt statistical outcome comparing chance death.

From study Texas Department Health Human [From September 4 October 1, 2021: Unvaccinated people 13 times likely become infected COVID-19 fully vaccinated real, quantifiable 13-fold increase risk spreading deadly virus. analogy, unnecessarily unvaccinated like drunk. drunk home, really danger anyone else. Interacting others close-quarters unvaccinated like *driving* drunk. *guaranteed* kill someone, substantial quantifiable increase Nobody expected forced take mandatory vaccination.

In analogy, that's like saying nobody forced sober. knowledge, nobody Austria *forced* vaccinated. can't literally everything vaccinated person due increased risk people. like drunk people allowed drunk, allowed everything sober person already peace idea don‚Äôt.

I good friend myeloma immunocompromised result. know long together, unvaccinated people putting friend substantially increased risk premature death. say ""at peace idea"" people putting friend risk, seems insensitive. like saying peace people driving drunk. not, possible get infected Delta variant twice? info this? fully vaccinated back beginning year, got breakthrough infection Delta thankfully recovered 3 weeks post infection months ago. Now, since weather getting colder I‚Äôm asthmatic, I‚Äôve experiencing sinus congestion (an initial sign first infection) tightened chest. mind wondering it‚Äôs simple reaction cold it‚Äôs something worse‚Ä¶ Good them.

Hope Switzerland follow suit asap full lockdown needed. lot harder understand things like algebra.  states require it.

Do understand right, southern states require math highschool across US? Wonder manage Olympics. hard keep covid spreading it. actually know didn‚Äôt go hospital?

I searched earlier couldn‚Äôt find information that. 

Do even know dad died Covid?

He 97 years old. Even vaccine hospital care, still huge probability death. 

And 97 years old, may Covid took him.

If facts, I‚Äôd love hear them. based seeing making lot assumption.  weren‚Äôt people trusting vaccines Fauci, we‚Äôd much better spot now. cancer survivor someone exposed pretty strong drugs potentially extreme side effects, spot way anti-vaxxers. Modern medicine science saved life I‚Äôll damned ever doubt efforts combat virus. HUMAN BEINGS flaws learning go, yes, they‚Äôve done pretty commendable job fighting thus far. Expecting perfection fools errand opinion. Risk part life, risk Covid much, much greater vaccine side effect. There‚Äôs reason every anti-vaxxer runs ICU get sick, NEED doctors, science, medicine thank every single day.   Americans citizens right return America study says COVID worms, might help worms?   that, never understand purely organizational non-specialists feel need develop opinion specialist topics. specialists that! 

I mean, special case, Spahn actually repeated Drosten (One top german virolgists) said earlier podcast. 

But general, agree.  hope either time fixes it, figure something out. I‚Äôm glad meds help, it‚Äôs sometimes frustrating beholden them. Good see demanded stay, rescinded, made specific sections regarding protective equipment testing allowed stand.

The 2nd important part ETS protection employee's rights wear respirators. stands, nothing prevent employers forcing workers wear unfitted face coverings -- provide rudimentary source control, insufficient protect at-risk individuals. ETS clearly addresses issue. Ironically vaccine probably single best way optimize lifespan point. stop following news? vaccinated great, mean invincible. literally know testing positive affect do. number people interact could vulnerable people home, number people could vulnerable even know it.

Didn't US already see happens pretend things normal earlier year, summer things? stop following covid news pretend over. used bing search great, however way hell would ever take these. could mutagenic properties, anytime potentially alter cells run risk cancer, gonna big me.

Get vaccinated kids. 83 cases COVID-19 occurred CVnCoV group (n=12‚Äâ851) 1735¬∑29 person-years 145 cases occurred placebo group (n=12‚Äâ211) 1569¬∑87 person-years, resulting overall vaccine efficacy symptomatic COVID-19 48¬∑2%

I think that's pretty decent still, especially one shot. don‚Äôt know that. favorite anti vax nonsense. showed someone study indicated incidence rate 6 per 100,000 similar. said much. showed lower adverse event rate aspirin. natural immunity conspiracy pseudoscience?

Because yes, feel perfectly ok treated someone believes science natural immunity.

If you‚Äôre not, that‚Äôs you. try switch different nurse get one that‚Äôs vaccinated. none, drive next hospital see vaccinated nurses available serve you. 

Should rest society deprived even option feel situation?

I‚Äôm vaccinated. work healthcare. don‚Äôt give single damn vaxx status coworkers, fear them. There‚Äôs bigger fish fry here. ton coworkers quit vaccines mandated. number probably won‚Äôt come back even offered opportunity. remaining picking slack job 3-4 people getting super burned out. industry already short staffed even Covid, Covid made worse, mandates nail coffin some. warned guys beginning mandate business we‚Äôve closing entire wings. see entire hospitals shut next. ‚Äúsaving healthcare system?‚Äù ‚Äúincreasing hospital capacity?‚Äù It‚Äôs literally opposite. people like decided distaste certain people important providing healthcare all.

There article couple posts big healthcare system Massachusetts cancel surgeries due short staffing. fire like 2,000 healthcare workers vaxx status, ignoring natural immunity? 

Ive seeing reports news hospital closures. hospital Connecticut serving low income community. One Pennsylvania. Another New York. Wait, scratch that, two New York. One Arizona. One Long Beach California. that‚Äôs last three days. Go ahead plug ‚Äúhospital close‚Äù Google click news tab. Look hospitals closing past week alone, way mention here. across country.

Is want pandemic right winter wave? mass hospital closures across country sign mandates working intended?

I get people upset healthcare workers made choice disagree with. That‚Äôs want punished, right? Firing enough you, guys really pushing make sure wouldn‚Äôt even get unemployment benefits. guys came called stupid dumb idiots made distain known. backlog surgeries plus Covid plus flu cases start overwhelm hospitals around shutting due short staffing. Might want back gets bad enough. think getting worked bone throughout pandemic let go publicly shamed disrespected denied unemployment benefits, they‚Äôll even want come back? Many would, think, god bless it. know least one healthcare worker used work said she‚Äôs worked like dog disrespected put like yesterday‚Äôs trash got Covid serving public last year vaccines existed cone wants talk natural immunity. 

So start talking natural immunity? I‚Äôll start. Last week, foia request made CDC asking release data naturally immune individuals reinfected went transmit virus. CDC admits record ANYONE prior infection, recovered, got reinfected, went transmit virus others. ONE. Centers Disease Control (CDC), response Freedom Information Act (FOIA) request, said record individual previously infected COVID becoming reinfected transmitting virus others. FOIA request, submitted Sept. 2 attorney Aaron Siri Siri &amp; Glimstad law firm behalf Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN), sought following information: ‚ÄúDocuments reflecting documented case individual who: (1) never received COVID vaccine; (2) infected COVID once, recovered, later became infected again; (3) transmitted SARS-CoV-2 another person reinfected.‚Äù CDC responded Nov. 5, stating: ‚ÄúA search records failed reveal documents pertaining request. CDC

So CDC please continue conversation let us know firing nurses higher average levels natural immunity lack data suggest catch virus transmit others? evidence pose danger coworkers patients, shrinking hospital staff closing hospitals entire hospital wings based unfounded fear?

The American public deserves know. can't fathom put work in, intellectually, become doctor still end fucking dumb end. *John Elway entered chat* talking vitro studies, don‚Äôt count ‚Äúbeen proven work COVID‚Äù treatment/prevention. Dudes anal prolapse shits sterile mRNA vaccine, crazy part many people know vehemently absolute stupidest reasons I‚Äôve heard swap vaccinated illegals exchange unvaccinated citizens? I'd much prefer living among vaccinated illegals fact New Zealand citizens still can't enter astounds me. feel like healthcare infrastructure must poorly equipped handle type surge they've extreme nearly two years thing. think 180 narrative helped.

He's mRNA vaccines Janssen well reason.

And yes, anyone state obvious, he's pretty dumb. People get Covid vaccines vaccines still help. viral load less they're infectious less time. Also, infections milder.

How earth Central Govt manipulate numbers put public domain respective levels!! think delta specific booster would able cut transmission hospitalisation? seems like lot new treatments coming (merck, pfizer, az therapeutics) i'm sure useful pills patients cant get within 3 day window.  doesn't. fine head. person hair thinks there's chip vaccine possibly hair got even COVID come money. Believe there's chip want friend. Get shot anyway? üòò Astrazeneca (fully vaccinated June, eligible boosted December) question boosters. understanding properly? thought process someone vaccinated 6+ months ago lower levels anti bodies since body doesn‚Äôt keep anti bodies ready everything times. body encounters COVID use memory cells generate new anti bodies thought process encountering COVID situation could still become Ill waiting body produce anti bodies memory cells. Therefore booster restore high anti body counts nullifying waiting body produce anti bodies encounter COVID would turn prevent infection. Correct? one person. healthy horse Cases rise people infect one another started rising June peaked end summer, mid September. true number always greater. 20% asymptomatic, everyone bother getting tested. Dumb one too.    old, matter.

No, see manifestos everyday city planning projects global commitments. rarely see called manifestos negative connotations word developed Western world. shame reality good word.  Welcome future medicine. Doctors idiots.  Again, need peer reviewed study two.

That's I'm wishing original comment. I'm aware anecdotal stories lack credibility, there's many one ignore raising eyebrow. Vax clearly works way moment, mean can't make unlucky people blind cause long COVID without COVID. vaccine-induced period changes kind caught many ladies guard even rare, that's least mild comparison. Apologies, forgot NYC center universe. That‚Äôs fault doctors treating covid patients article initiative. Present rate seems like 600+

I guess 400 lagged bit?

That depends live. south saw huge surge summer tapered trending downward. Alabama summer 2021 peak higher winter peak last year. Why? Russia deliberately spread misinformation US make pandemic worse. Maybe make less likely future? gotta hope something stop them.  looked data months ago adverse events moderna/Pfizer.

We use describe works everyone MLK Charles Manson. think Manson MLK? agree you, point remains initial Moderna shot better Pfizers. learn that? Let's keep Pfizer same, make Moderna worst?

I'm still thinking they'll (pick pharma) release new booster early 2022, people need wait least 6 months last shot. new booster target delta better, also future variants based variants mutated. don‚Äôt get paper card get vaccinated? stand US J&amp;J boosters? recommended another J&amp;J say Moderna instead?

For worth, I'm Kiwi expat sister entered NZ holiday without problems. Absolutely makes sense get booster.

You likely need booster every 6 months. public guidance atrocious, confirm health officials dishonest. Despite people think, last year pretty much expected boosters point, though maybe couple months earlier expected. However, people realize boosters normal nearly disease vaccinate requires two three boosters increasing amount time them. far research leans towards COVID same, booster giving far antibodies original shot does, great sign. quite possible COVID vaccine really 3 4 shot vaccine, boosters might even able get herd immunity COVID go away.

So news great, public depression vaccines? Well, main reason basically lying get political effect want. pretending boosters useless, said things booster ""a third life jacket"". correct really protect dying more, lying drastic effect spread.

I degree health, one math. looked video vaccines pandemic, one would talked great protect personally dying. Rather, greatest effect vaccines prevent people spreading it. causes butterfly effect, spread people spread people entire branches tree infection. reduces infection, hospitalization, death, possibly even vaccine's self protection, indirectly hard measure. protection personal death effected boosters much, get protection spread boosters extremely important. basically lying everyone try promote vaccine equity - short sighted harm global health enough vaccines people need boosted.

The aspect making think boosters worse likely people comparing vaccine flu vaccine. flu vaccine need taken yearly. However, flu mutates much point need different vaccine year. COVID mutate lot, point still using vaccine. possible could change, can't promise one way still could end needing vaccines yearly. point I'd say least looks possible maybe even favorable boosting twice enough.

Finally, may noticed said year. signs currently point COVID seasonal. even worst case reason technically need vaccines every six months, that's would work practice. believe flu vaccine actually give yearly protection either, time get past peak. reason need constant vaccines going forwards (which think smaller possibility), would almost certainly get flu vaccine yearly winter peak would hit. Ahhh Ocala, makes sense world now.

Or call New England:  Mud. came realization [this I'm loop, saying state lines? really hate comments like these. infuriating.

Sadly anger one effective way get views world profits dependent ad revenue.

It's really moral thing working. know ever stop eating meat least week stopped drinking cow's milk easy.  need good testing infrastructure, also: get tested get antiviral within effective window?

Actually, also need cultural change: test since symptoms instead trying tough out. passes digital. site linked e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

 vaccine don‚Äôt. Risk want 
 
The problem mentality get vaccinated, risking every person come contact may immunized. quite legitimate reasons someone might immunity. Maybe got shot receiving medical treatment using immunosuppressants counteract vaccine. Maybe they're young get yet. Maybe they're pregnant get booster (one friends situation right now). Maybe doctor told can't get allergy autoimmune disease. 
 
The point get vaccinated choose to, risking lives own. 
 outlets still reporting people getting Covid 
 
Because people still dying COVID, like what? global pandemic that, again, killed 5 million people. news reports current events COVID still current event. Ah yes good argument. clearly see considered point.  Lol, ridiculous. Probably not, never figure things late. 54% vaccinated, real push boosters, antivaxx politicians doctors advising people get vaccinated get boosters. rulisng party minority parliament depend every vote shaky coalition - antivaxx party can't go hard antivaxxers.  technically enter country, hotel quarantine system limited spots made effectively impossible unless super well off.

I family NZ essentially barred country close two years now. Even fully vaccinated, get in. 80's want see family die. whole thing really soured New Zealand Jacinda.

There's life avoiding COVID. It‚Äôs similar weather Rockies, even though someone could stay outdoors days, doesn‚Äôt take much send people in. Like, large lunches super-cautious office still outdoors it‚Äôs lovely weather every time, people started small ones dinners indoors, it‚Äôs 60 instead 80 might snow it‚Äôs risk schedule things outside don‚Äôt want deal it. lo behold, first breakthrough case office know happened last week. it‚Äôs big population, small behavior changes make big differences.  know that‚Äôs reason believes that?

I think she‚Äôs deluded terms creationist beliefs, sure. creationism antivaxism. It‚Äôs whole different conspiracy.

And creationism largely victimless, compared antivaxism. people far deserving scorn her, imo. Lol ok article referring risk developing post COVID myocarditis, seemingly higher risk developing post vaccine. interesting, I've read universal flu vaccines currently trials way generally work creating nanoparticle like 30 different spike proteins stitched together. sounds like could much elegant permanent solution bears out.  arguably approve one inactivated virus vaccines China India, ""traditional"" vaccine v using 1950s tech. think many people reachable, though. articles sensationalist headlines going around lately, particularly ones ""high-vax-rate areas"" increases hospitalizations, infuriating.

If really wanted help get people jabbed, they'd running headlines ""Remaining Unvaccinated Filling ICUs""; deniers need shamed point. another exposure activatws immune system. People got covid vaccine high protection. think there's enough science yet claim covid vax, logical. Nut jobs use word ""The"" often use word ""Manifesto"" associate word ""The"" nut jobs? 

No.

Why?

Because words get associations culture users. 

In West used word ""Manifesto"" cultural works depict threatening statements scare readers.

Nope, can't that! Gotta libs! talking about?  Fifth wave  ""Shootouts ***occasionally*** overwhelm ERs cause diversions hospitals.""

Well, shootouts routinely overwhelm ERs across country time, maybe discuss best way triage care. shit. still lot people's situation. exactly person say incorrect? really go comment history attempt make point? Second covid booster? know people care fifth wave infections? *fifth* wave bucking would eat many people away.

I'm usually pretty good this, idea trying say here. Honestly, revelation covid endemic, really need take steps drastically expand hospital capacity. say anecdotes taken fact? think they're lying? Anecdotal evidence may constitute scientific proof still evidence nonetheless, no? every hospital! lucky find hospital fully staffed well maintained (even pre-pandemic!) COVID exacerbated it. Buddy mine got flu sick 10 days. got 2nd Covid booster offered flu shot well. Next day bad worth it. That's problem without sick leave, problem virus Dude, really got good season 4.  waves existed many people stopped pretending care first one. wave worse last year's? Breakthroughs ""asymptomatic worst."" still suck annoyingly fort people keep workplace major disruption. study? daughter chronically ill medical care delayed including hospitalization. Several times rush hospital bed finally opened could admitted hold long (hospital doctor admits 90 minute drive away). Exactly. cater unvaccinated driving pandemic want take shot. rest us suffer. since restrictions anything would prevent unvaccinated participating society, literally reason get shot need anything all. Even cities indoor vaccine mandate likely many thousands people using easily-photoshopped forgeries. see attitude 'over it' anything new, people 'over it' since last summer vaccines.  Unfortunately progress made treatment longer 'this' goes less people seem care.

Personally, got weeks ago cuz I'm tryna get sick. sure also re-enforced point staying ruins bacteria wear mask since wear one well. awesome wear too. Masks little least something vaccines available. Yup. That's basically said. Alpha different story. Delta flipped script. that, wouldn‚Äôt lie claim vaccinated..?  first two shots plus booster. I'm relatively young. I'm wildly pro-vax live area (Seattle) 75+% mask usage late March 2020. We're currently 90% eligible residents vaccinated, 80+% residents vaccinated. still indoor mask mandate 99+% adherence local stores. check post history want, absolutely agree person wrote. point, entirely ready live life, people know. ohh yea, driving Buffalo couple weeks back, stop way snack gas; handful people masking up. Ignorance bliss comes highly contagious virus impacting world, plain old stup1d1ty. mean, saw dTrump flags way people masks.  Unless specifically son? wear mask around son? feel mask, even cloth, works prevent possible transmission son wear around him? trying clarify here. doctors quitting? PAs? nurses? Stupid people stupid reasons? point question simple way avoid one situations: drunk driver druggie ER. answer yes obviously is. really easy understand start deciding one group people worthy medical treatment start applying thought process people. 

Think way: decide anti-vaxers deserving medical treatment could avoided virus getting vaccinated stops religious doctor conservative state denying STD treatment gay man? denying OBGYN treatment woman pregnant marriage? could easily claim people could avoided ailments. 

If think 10 seconds idea denying treatment people falls apart. seems great people appeal emotion ethically bankrupt, reputable medical professionals would ever even suggest it. beard sits seal mask interferes it, yes, going problem. Smaller beards within mask usually ok. actually got booster hour ago. good boy, went Wendy's even got frosty. No, that's literally non-stop. Especially region.

Example, campaign May pushed: Apparently anything would actually work mitigate situation can't done hard, would cost someone money, would hurt unvaccinated people's delicate feel-feels.

So are.   hospital pretty much beds isnt staffing issue, staff room. turn transfers send people now. 600% increase lot‚Ä¶

But point, population decided COVID zero never achieved, expect catch COVID eventually. Think Chickenpox: vaccination campaign, 95% Americans Chickenpox. It‚Äôs matter time catch it. PT 36 years, think comment SPOT ON. Yeah fields (like ours) ‚Äòunderstaffed‚Äô NOTHING like nursing- seen reflected nurses back injuries, foot ailments/injuries neck/shoulder injuries/wear tear. OPPOSITE ‚Äòmalingerers‚Äô‚Äî-they serious referrals seen, soldier take care LAST. Sorry hear that.   Well thanks FDA approving boosters everyone weeks ago already data Israel thinks they're semi intelligent

Found problem  Really high quality masks work. Still good vaccines. anecdotal evidence proof anything. wear cloth mask times peak numbers last month FL. caught Covid wear mask time unless I'm specifically son young vaxxed. usually 3-5 days exposure becoming contagious... 

That case origional COVID last year. Delta moves lot quickly. Masks little

California seems escaped surge cycle, masks widely worn, least LA. go movie masks worn 90% people. went auto show art museum, 99% mask wearing observed. 5th? though 3rd. death issue Covid huh? good stroke, amputation, breathing problems? need anti-smoking style PSAs. Get people recovered covid months hospital struggling speak bodies ravaged. Tearful interviews family members lost multiple loved ones.

Yes, always idiots swayed call fake. idiots friends family swayed put pressure them. asking nice. Time show brutal reality.  Yes Kn95s, 99% people use. pointless. work make serious illness less likely. eliminate possibility. key distinction lot people seem missing. least EU afraid reimpose restrictions, top indoor vaccine mandate. never reinstated restrictions dropped them, concept indoor vaccine mandate deemed ""controversial"" implement sort federal even state level US. OP I'm correct spikes delta variant (upon mRNA vaccines based) differ much original Wuhan variant. increased infectivity mainly caused 100x increase virus output infected people compared older variants. Changing vaccine affect that, booster shots (unfortunately) necessary keep immunity up. Yeah kind want watch anymore accusations covid touching children places, paper card, scannable pri table barcode phone  That's reason think? Plain stupidity ?  ...and think family actually went visit place 4th July mini vacation months ago.

What actual *hell* year even...?

BTW, whole family double-vaxxed, booster shot obtained past weekend... üòä   Constructive interference! care sense affects jobs decision come back office full-time teleworking we're now.

If try get us back office, point fifth wave excuse stay teleworking. kinda win me! Probably one dumbest unethical ideas. Wonderful  Masks extremely effective get real mask instead cheap cloth one wear properly. Vaccines plus masks would enough pretty much end COVID I'll never stop frustrated people pretend otherwise. both, one other. still wear seatbelt even though car airbags. Looking comment history, doubt ever took seriously. Heard EXACT explanation nurse friend. Yup! Rampant industries 23 year old male, make sense get booster? I'm worried myocarditis potential bad reaction shot.

I'd say yes. risk myocarditis small (at most, 1 10K, almost small moderate, lasting consequences). I'm sure vaccine really cracked be, reading NY Times, year, already deaths last year, vaccine. 

It cracked be. First all, COVID start March 2020, large percentage vaccinations maybe April/May? Delta variant much contagious original one, comparison 2020 2021 tell much seems like people getting re-infected COVID, make sense 100k cases day still infected everyone U.S.

100k cases day give \~36M cases year, US population \~300M, would take almost 10 years, assuming reinfections. hard reason big numbers :)

We know often need boosters, luck less year. Vaccines protect you, also community, so, although \*everybody\* skips vaccination booster horrible person, unfortunately, become politicized, get \*are\* horrible people, least horrible reasons :)

Some guidance change, since COVID new, there's ton stuff know. health officials purposefully lying, we're learning stuff, people purposefully trying highlight exaggerate mistakes.

Try get depressed. Life already much better last year (we vaccines, better treatments), keep adjusting improving. relevant question ""waning efficacy what?"". 
 
I've read numerous news articles studies showing protection *getting symptomatic infection* wanes time, protection illness level leading hospitalization and/or death remains high. Put simply, shortly vaccination, unlikely get sick covid all, much less hospitalized die, time possiblity getting sick covid (but still hospitalized dying) slowly goes up.
 
Every symptomatic case covid, got hooks immune system playing catch-up, opportunity mutate. If, getting boosters directed, maintain high levels protection hospitalization/death, also getting symptomatic case, means body defeating virus get foothold become detectably ill. Fewer cases covid overall good desirable, period.
 
Think like this, helps... Imagine house you, house fire symptomatic case, house burning like hospitalization dying. Right immunization like fire department drill tiny fires around house putting out. bunch firefighters standing around nearby. That's immune system high alert. something much starts smolder (you're exposed covid), near-at-hand firefighters stomp right away (that's even getting symptomatically ill). time, fire awhile, fewer firefighters hanging around nearby. something smolders catches fire (covid exposure), may take longer put fire fewer firefighters around, call back station reinforcements, fire contained house burn (that would getting perhaps mild symptomatic case, still getting severely ill dying). Even later, awhile fires (exposures covid) really firefighters hanging around ready leap first sign smoke anymore, catch fire (another covid exposure). call fire department, hustle out, got bit fire going took time mobilize you. still put house burns (you go hospital die, got sick, maybe pretty bad case). It‚Äôs due large part higher percentage population vaccinated. even though per capita rate serious breakthrough cases low, happen larger numbers people vaccinated. fact covid deaths among unvaccinated people still much higher vaccinated folks telling less less unvaccinated folks. Yet still dying often even though represent smaller portion population. 

Your arguments form misinformation trying narrative simply isn‚Äôt true. 

Get god damned vaccine. Gotta love irony mentioning benefit kindness also patronizing/passive aggressive time lol. Humans fun. least Biden make wear stupid masks. I'll give one homie know lateral flow test tell I'm cured COVID. Got COVID symptoms week ago Mumbai 87% seropositivity ~no covid.

A lot countries small summer delta wave worse fall/winter wave. countries far 87% attack/3-dose rate.

India country watch though. Israel Uruguay avoided third waves lot third doses canaries ending Delta pandemic vaccination. Colombia almost Covid, sort confusing balance Delta Mu+ (the non-Delta variant still matters) could end either competing antigenetically opposite strains extinction Mu. 100% this. public health messaging breakthrough infections horrible. Yeah suck filling hospitals.

Plus unvaxed, area anyway, 10x case rate factoring population size. Damn dude. Reading comprehension strong suit. times **triage used decide someone deserves treatment** based condition, likelihood survival.  factor think person deserving**. proved point exactly.

Lol **nurses doctors factor think individual deserving** triaging them. try save many lives can.  also examine patient's life considering organ transplants**: get value gift. alcoholic smoker likely going live less healthy/long life someone give person likely live longest healthiest (in terms quality) life.

So decide deserving organ donation, don't? Contradicting within two sentences pretty strawman one arguing. one person deserving another, firmly established medical ethics.

But said doctors choose deserves organs, it? choose deserving fine, realize opinion irrelevant never see anyone responsibility deciding policy even remotely consider position.

Wrong again. 

This already debated medical ethics boards country. Here's examples, quick Google search turn many more. Plenty rationing care unvaccinated, plenty against. However, active debate hardly ""irrelevant"" ""anyone responsibility deciding policy even remotely consider position"".

""However, strength physician‚Äôs obligation treat may vary different circumstances, determining whether, particular instance, physician may ethically decline patient requires careful reflection. context highly transmissible disease poses significant risk severe illness safe, effective vaccine available, decision accept decline patient must balance urgency individual patient‚Äôs need; risk patient may pose patients physician‚Äôs practice; need physician staff, available provide care clinicians wonder whether ethically obligated treat unvaccinated patients. ‚ÄúThis serious concern among many doctors. suspect sooner rather later, physicians start avoiding unvaccinated patients outpatient setting,‚Äù says Jacob M. Appel, MD, JD, MPH, HEC-C, director ethics education psychiatry Icahn School Medicine Mount comes time ration health care resources, good options left. question find least-bad option save lives. 
The Governor‚Äôs Expert Emergency Epidemic Response Committee updating state‚Äôs crisis standards care hospitals prioritize patients worsening COVID-19 crisis leaves unable provide best health care everyone. 
That process lead potentially thorny ethical questions: vaccinated patients given priority people who‚Äôve chosen get inoculated virus? way patients‚Äô age play decisions made rationing care? 
When standards written beginning pandemic spring 2020, vaccines weren‚Äôt yet available, science knew relatively little new virus biggest concern running ventilators. 
Now, Colorado likely run dialysis machines beds intensive-care units ventilators; doctors know drugs might help COVID-19 patients; vaccines widely  I‚Äôve actually seen two like sure county state funded y'all even leave waves?  reading numerous HCAs, sure would even work. seems vaccines mandatory, compliance, recurring fine enough hurt. One way make non-compliance misdemeanor one year jail maximum $1,000 fine dismissed expunged people fully vaccinated. 

It kind like drug court, would argue virus much dangerous drug use terms societal impact. problem is, political this. already tried carrot approach, time take stick.

Another incentive would pay federal tax returns person shows proof full vaccination. Although, see political get stick anytime soon.

Mandates set employers good start. read agencies companies, led 90% vaccination rate among employees. We‚Äôre vaccinated social distancing spend one fucking day together. We‚Äôre bracing people haven‚Äôt bound end disaster.  Wtf? would even make focus research?? tests shown B cell response waned bit mRNA ones time went didn‚Äôt J&amp;J. speculation two shots really close together. floated ideas shot spacing think real issue early one simply wasn‚Äôt time optimize spacing increase rollout speed. could spent months seeing 30 days 45 days 60 days etc best time second shot. Faster rollout advantageous time, it‚Äôs far easier give booster.

J&amp;J probably suffered well two doses it‚Äôs long slow ramp (such point 14 days really shouldn‚Äôt considered fully vaccinated least 28). Even government‚Äôs suggestion booster really doesn‚Äôt coincide J&amp;J‚Äôs trials seem indicate waiting 6 months ideal time boost (I think gave like 14 times antibodies suggested 2 months gave like 5). 

In instance though giving boosters simple enough maybe 15 minute inconvenience. 

I see report moderna suggesting third dose improved B cell response given certain timeframe don‚Äôt recall timeframes, want say started around 4 month mark. Wook flu.  Hilarious. Glad better. Never know wook might give you. Vaccine effectiveness infection wanes time. You‚Äôll likely fine hospitalization death, get spread someone else, might fine. 
Boosters effective solution moment.  daughters school lifted wear masks 3 weeks ago. Last night school notified us girl sits right next lunch tested positive. COVID June year we‚Äôre vaccinated wife got booster shot 3 weeks ago. call family today tell Thanksgiving family dinner canceled. Sucks short notice is. - we're year two this. People saying ""this going go forever"" - that's pandemics work. virus needs move endemic phase, takes time mixtures natural infection, vaccination, medical advancements, it'll get we're WAY ahead thought going March 2020 (all experts literally saying around would time vaccines would first discovered).  Yes humoral immunity gets reactivated antibodies produced antigen cleared antibodies decrease again.

However watched german video german immunologist (Carsten Watzl) daysago presented studies pointed antibodies remain higher level one month 3rd shot compared one month 2nd shot.

Thats part reason think view part general immunization booster waning efficacy. another great thing older people weaker antibody response compared younger people 2 shots groups get ""the booster"" antibody response pretty comparable around level. Rather guilt trip rich countries wanting protect children (and ourselves), removing patent protections global manufacturers start building capacity produce vaccines? vaccines developed relatively quickly probably generated incredible revenue already. manufacturers made money. Good them. Get IP out. Boosters made available adults. *That* bar safe you‚Äôll get. Many pharmacies drive thru, many delivery, even didn't, would bet wearing mask. never said anything moral not. whole point, irrelevant. get use morals decide whether give medical treatment human being. Even war armies provide medical treatment enemy. even open question, firmly decided. 

Ethics morals different things. bound ethics treat someone morally disagreeing them. medical system setup. 

Seriously, understand why? really understand might problematic empower individuals make moral decisions someone deserving treatment? ""I saved patient X good christian let patient die clearly atheist liberal"" we're trying avoid allowing people bring morals equation. one saying good situation, pressuring anti-vaxers every ethical means get vaccinated, one position speak medical policy suggesting denying treatment anti-vaxers OP thread suggesting. main cause myocarditis viral infection. Covid 19 viral infection. serious wanting vaccine, talk doctor. doctor provide best information vaccine, along benefits specific risks may due personal health concerns.  Never underestimate power incredibly stupid people large groups. Per 100k, 7 day rolling average, European countries 10x rate right now.... Singapore 5x initial shot May, booster weeks later. got second booster Saturday. Yep want know infectious moment, rapid antigen test best (only?) tool tool box. guess also rapid pcr tests, I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre available pharmacies ilk adds multiple steps logistics.

Rapid test ideally home already use convenience extra layer security. way it? vaccines work doubt natural immunity either. Seems vulnerable need active antibodies point. vaccination getting covid over. appear long term immunity(either infection vaccination) good enough prevent serious infection. shorter people die needlessly propaganda apathy. It'll end &lt;90% population either catches covid gets 2-3 vaccine doses. Since hospitals handle 1-2% unvaccinated population catching covid per week, vaccination far faster.

Get first, second, third dose. We're outdoor thanksgiving year, though much warmer Oregon. Stay safe, friend group fairly careful i'm sure they'll understand event beyond risk tolerance.  NIce paywall. vaccines stopped transmission hope nurses strike next time contract up. Grab greedy health system CEO‚Äôs balls twist. Get you‚Äôve deserved earned long COVID. kind people need traced tend willing speak contact tracers. know someone temp job tracer Tennessee said mostly people swearing spewing conspiracy theories. time though, left messages knowing people would never call bother call back.   Hmm far SSDD. (Same Shit, Different Day) Europe surging Delta unfortunately. I'd compare countries similar climates vaccination rates yours. state current numbers showing 75-80% protection levels. 90% immediately initial doses. 78-80 hospitalization. really sound like waning efficacy. 

I booster hoping keep hospital.  state current numbers showing 75-80% protection levels. 90% immediately initial doses. 78-80 hospitalization. really sound like waning efficacy. 

I booster hoping keep hospital. bunch things circulating besides covid. random big wave RSV tear Massachusetts late September. may something exposed cold viruses awhile. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre okay wasn‚Äôt covid! Schools bracing it. 5 - 11 yrs old crowd getting vaccines now, many still 1 shot in. there's enough time group get 2 shots 2 weeks second shot, schools still cautious. mid January, seems like family wanted get 5 kids vaccine time so. maybe schools relax, unless start see kids testing positive vaccine like adults.  must like 40% weed point booster even hit hard flu shot normally does...

Shit, I'll take 4x year gonna smooth every time... everyone's boosted, pretty good go. There's risk, small.

If people havent got yet elderly relatives haven't, blame cautious. Immunity defintely waning might near past 6 months since second dose. always zero-sum game guys? I'm vaccinated worried, I'm stupid. Jan-Mar 2021 vaccine rates starting increase. diabetes like single biggest comorbidity tho? Confused said ""only"". That's worst one, right? I'm confused... supposed pick prescription clearly needs? letting guard till youngest get vaccinated. Considering statistics 25-30% folks w/ kids 0-5 probably teh boat.  clarified post saying much implied due deaths reported well. what's actually correct. ego, decided argue it, acknowledge argue again. Flip flop flip again. person used ‚Äúnearly all‚Äù vs ‚Äúmost‚Äù. However pointing difference two characterizations pedantic isn‚Äôt helping conversation. 

The data clear. Vaccines work. risk death dramatically reduced vaccinated population. Stop arguing it.  Yup did. Good hear everyone family fine ! :) 

""It point. We‚Äôre going exposed this. breakthrough infections. fight off.""

Yes right. think many people actually get ""breakthrough cases"" thats bad thing long vaccines cellular immunity protects us severe disease.

Many people consider immunity ""sterilizing immunity"" actually many endemic viruses immunity sterilizing immunity against. example 4 endemic coronaviruses like Oc43 common cold viruses like rhinoviruses. catch time time get mild cold although immunity them.

Immunity much complex ""sterilizing immunity"". 

You see look immunosuppressed humans retirement homes example ""harmless"" rhinoviruses common cause severe pneumonia example ""harmless"" all. still talking like is. think form Rapture apparently. long version get take old testament literally. Science religion mutually exclusive. big bang believe God created Earth, billions years ago. boosted (and high-risk) risk minimal; 0, tiny.

If like group, means go concert. think Fauci likes Alabama saying chase away vaccinated embrace aren't? Public spaces without rules. Wait fifth? thought still second!? Strep throat one time return wedding trip time felt like legit gonna die I‚Äôve flu I‚Äôve Covid.  Contrary belief, even normal times, people get sick winter colds/flu STILL exist.

I know 5 people horrible colds thought COVID tested negative. actually laughed this. Haha. Maybe add parents immunocompromised hospital workers. even boosted hospitals full effects everyone else. ""argument"" seems moral status quo. many deaths every day, yet people US seem live without much concern it?

There want vaccinated fully vaccinated wear masks, seem lack infection control measures.

If lived there, might scared leave house. link opinion article. got free lunch box l got mineüòÉ Thanks assist. It‚Äôs fixed. considerate. pretty sure plans required cover Covid since 2019. Yes, older friend/mechanic urging get vaccinated months finally got first dose last week. I've doubt families demanding vaccination attend holiday events driving force. think moreso low pay, long hours, constantly understaffed nurses done - fault hospital administrations government, sick people. could get California's like ""nah fam boats stay ocean. Nah fam let's bar half trucking fleet entering. supply bad?"" J&amp;J booster fine. However already J&amp;J getting mRNA booster shown greatly increase protection. age, risk serious outcome basically nil, even without booster. Get booster don‚Äôt stress it. Good you! 

Now try, much can, judgmental others :). people may different risks, may care things do. Maybe enjoy family reunions? least $1,000,000 per shot. LOL 90%  said global authority pandemics stuff!  Ok username literally misinformation. quite, delta infectious get gaps immune system. Herd immunity impossible delta. Maybe explains never felt bad shots lmao That's fine long accident snowstorm rural New York anytime March. Yay! Good news! literally says ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù first descriptor lmao. everyone immune Delta even infectious variant evade antibodies people beat Delta. rest nation gets colder, expect see ""wave"" spread south next several weeks.

Quite bit different Scott Gottlieb said. believes south (Florida example) well Delta wave already pounded hard lot immunity there. cute think are.

Of course aren't, cats! dogs, dog person. New Hampshire fully vaccinated state country. Far it.

How flush credibility right gate! Also, capitalization....what country from, way?   wish could read article people recovered COVID-19 might benefit COVID-19 vaccination.6, 19 fact, one study found previous COVID-19 associated increased adverse events following vaccination Comirnaty BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech).

I guess citing Lancet makes ""anti-vaxxer""... Yup, top infectious disease journal anti-vaxx according you. Yep. It‚Äôs story many industries. Run skeleton crew don‚Äôt pay enough make select $$$ literally said thing reading comment. Novavax actually incredible achievement. people shitting it.

Ohh no, better get ready 50th booster ü§£ Trust $cience..  keep background noise chores. 50-70% less spread covid mask worn stop droplets getting air. That's good enough me. But, I'm SF highly vaccinated people wear masks...not Michigan opposite true 100k new cases last two weeks. 

I'd say we're fine here. wonder much attribution waning vaccines studies due unvaccinated control groups full people like due selection bias. Indeed. Many like turn jokes deal suffering, I‚Äôd bet nothing humerus it. outright lie. Cite remove. takes repulsive. vaccine bunk hell people immune deficiencies less optimal elderly ""the pandemic masks useless let's cut turkey hurrr durrr"" comments ableist FUCK. Glad healthy person 20's 30's work ER empathy goddamn. everyone is. try new fries? keep hearing ads gushing big claims yet. Congrats booster! :)  Never mind cases, I‚Äôd concerned deaths. Given know deaths lag cases two three weeks, they‚Äôre reporting 340 deaths per day, know fast cases risen past three weeks Germany, seems like they‚Äôll getting close January peak deaths per day three weeks time regardless whether choose anything reduce case count. 

Either that, they‚Äôve got better finding cases recently growth infections isn‚Äôt quite dramatic growth cases. Let‚Äôs hope there‚Äôs least going on. obvious anyone even vaguely follows COVID. fear-mongering headline even subtle... everyone antibodies Delta - vaccination infection - variant evades beat Delta since Delta unable infect people.   vaxxed?

People telling embrace normality fine, dont feel like it. might cautious, sure fear justified point. Im optimistic something effective come future. work cemetery. get really busy top curves. Pretty slammed right authorised push take almost one - example Poland. mention authorised 6 months 5 months like Israel - friends got infected 5th month waiting eligible 3rd dose. Covid hard them, one ended hospital. It‚Äôs gonna happen. Well said. I've shocked lately ""over"" public acting, covid POS ems calls rise. almost seems like never end. 5 year old emotionally regressed horrendously COVID infection. continue get chided wearing mask everyday fully vaxxed. me, 3 year old. feels like talking brick wall time. exactly I‚Äôm leaving EMS going travel nursing. get this. even drill numbers... still pretty grim. vaccines work much thought did. Info changing real time. know 2 people died covid getting full dose (one moderna, one Pfizer). know 5 6 people got covid fully vaxxed (all within 3months dose). 
I'm saying get vaxxed. nearly much handle things thought many people still think. 5th wave.. theory practical thought saw 10% kids Michigan far.

I surprised learn people vaccinated kids didn‚Äôt expect to. He‚Äôs sick. He‚Äôll back amount money spent people would paid every single public health measure needed prevent covid ever getting started.

We're going see either colossal rationing last-year-of-life care, greatest transfer wealth economic sector since time began. dialysis needs alone going overwhelming. happening obese people, already ticking time bomb, clinically difficult diagnose manage, represent impossible burden medical support personnel. really two seats airplane, need four people move change bedding, they're paying that.

People never hospital, one end other, getting picture goes there: takes, getting worse bean-counting for-profit management. really hit fan covid. mean makes sense. Covid really super widespread til maybe end April, middle May last year. full widespread covid entire year 2021 Thank input, WHO. However, already nursing sick children one bout COVID (and husband's breakthrough case) once, I'm again. tortoise offended this! We‚Äôre going exposed this

A lot people believe able outrun this. following success High vaccination coverage. vaccines used Pfizer Moderna. vaccination intervals 3 weeks Pfizer 4 weeks Moderna thoroughly strictly adhered High rate mask use. Almost people wear masks even vaccination. wear masks everywhere except homes eating. Even ""mask-wearing"" ""vaccination"" issues politicized. Furthermore, almost protesters (or are, end treated Tourists travel purposes allowed enter yet. (Foreigners entering country business study purposes already begun point protesting rules. It‚Äôs pandemic collapse health system encounters goes control. Get it. world foreseeable future. 2020, people immunologically immune. 2021, 80-90% Americans seropositive.

Try googling ""NYC covid deaths"" see much progress we've made. NYC hit hard 2020, gained high degree natural immunity, daily death count exceeded 20 many months, even Delta. Thse amazing numbers city 8 million population. active Covid case household, need call ask. ""It advertised"" excuse putting bunch people risk. mean get prescription else do? Please provide evidence new variant identified.

Thanks. I've saying years people keep coming back telling improvement before.

That may true extent, long-term, nothing lower costs make health care ""affordable"". (The official name ""Patient Protection Affordable Care Act"") everywhere stupid useless all! truth at. 

We went urgent care week half ago daughter RSV doctor saw us looked exhausted. Like point pretty alarming. felt bad even though nurse online told us come in.

I knew medical staff were/are pushed limits right now, something else witness first hand small scale. I've urging friends family extra cautious everything that. FYI, Pakistan 100% Indian subcontinent South Asia. 

Southeast Asia would Indochina (Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam) + countries (Philippines, Indonesia). took vaccine found going kill me, I'd die happy knowing least tried right thing. pushing single payer healthcare reducing human suffering instead.

I‚Äôm 41. started getting flu shot around 34 so. 2 reasons, 1: fairly healthy, old grandma died flu‚Ä¶ thinking ‚Äúless transmission flu, less grandmas die it.‚Äù 2: getting sick actually sucks balls. immune system doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúget stronger‚Äù sick. That's reason *not* get vaccinated. you? What's downside? free, easy way get even protection people trust recognize.

There absolutely reason decline vaccination unless afraid needles anti-vaxxer. booster changed everything antibodies.  went get vaccinated guys work. hit brewery right after. boss kept drinking weekend. 

I actually motorcycled 300 miles day after. biggie. guess guys wont go lockdown regardless? europe bracing lockdown, virus itself. got booster seven months second shot kept hearing friends getting really sick fully vaccinated six plus months ago want risk I'm wondering waited made quite sick Agree. vaccinated people expect infected winter season mild symptoms. gives even better ""hybrid"" immunity could longer-lasting. Thanks captain obvious, I'm trying quantify efficiency rate statistics Indeed. best today monoclonals (pavilizumab) doesn‚Äôt reduce risk much one would like $5000 price tag. sources sum nicely reading comprehension impaired: COVID-19 vaccination, care? that‚Äôs **wrong** remove words case getting confused: sure simpler terms describe it: wrong. Maybe next time AMA produce picture someone read you.    big promise gov'ts gave us. needed get 70% could go back normal. 80%. crickets.

Posted another comment thread here, curious sound familiar? truly think almost took out.  likely gut bacteria longer existent point.  know retired cardiologist POV deeply saddens me. recall correctly, hydrochloroquine Ivermectin.  hydroxychloroquine shown harmful net benefit COVID?   GOLEM  logic flawed start. 

Nobody wants get COVID, right? COVID fun, it‚Äôs extremely infectious, cause permanent organ damage even children. 

There exists extremely safe preventative measure prevented 100% COVID infections adolescents scientific trial. 

You suggest people prevent COVID by... getting COVID. 

The worst case outcome getting vaccinated kid:

-	gets treatable case myocarditis (much less serious much less likely myocarditis associated COVID infection, I‚Äôll add)
-	gets COVID anyway (but milder disease), would provide natural immunity covet much

So worst case outcome getting vaccinated still better getting COVID unvaccinated kid, plan. 

I reiterate, hesitation vaccinating children myocarditis, much worried children contracting COVID, chance myocarditis lot higher COVID infection. consistent.   I'm saying governments need taking cut profits. using words specific industry definitions without understanding mean.

I'm actually thing choose words fit definition. know jargon chose word applies. fact paper sent argues clearly public-private sectors intertwined public sector actually often get payout money re-invested research paying salary scientists.

The paper cute rationalization current situation accurate description government paying costs industry extracting profits unbalanced equation. Mild compared though....DEATH! flu (not confirmed BAD flu year either way, almost died) turned pneumonia '09, living border city US Canada. horrible hospital go, weak anything think straight fever. literally like, welp, could it, many times bouts clarity. waking drowning every minutes totally *days*. fever dreams infinite drowning never ended, death, breath air, I'd wake .....FUCKING DROWNING LUNGS, over. Lost 15 lbs already slim frame. wanted relief breathing laboured painful, coughed blood one point. young (very stupid, hole) alone.

The exhaustion floored me. indescribable, I've never (luckily) felt close death again, looking back mature knowledgeable eyes, know host things could happened time.

I prop sleep, even keeping breathing efficient enough die. lungs constantly ""wet"".

You cannot explain weak feels, literally helpless. fucks mind up. never EVER fuck around like again.

Only recently realize 2009 swine flu year! I've feels like almost super immunity flu since too, knows. Part brain still says ""well odds even that?"", fuckin matter tho! Whatever want NOTHING with, COVID sounds like *THAT* sent 11, thanks! ""not 
 
6.3+ million cases children reported. knows many experience long term symptoms. Perhaps high 10%. 
 
Approx 1%, 63,000 kids hospitalized covid. 
 
Approx. 600+ kids dead covid. 
 
I'd happily agree that, statistically, risk covid kids small. 
 
But ""not risk virus. period.""??? Come on, man, that's wrong.  Ahi ent's Mission accomplished !  Honestly, fall line way ICU beds do. use it. arent restricting care dont listen regarding vaccines, placed line everyone, given priority.   listened top doc Canada's Covid Table. asked transmission surfaces air, said 100% confirmed. go say though constant sanitizing surfaces required (no ""regular"" fine) attention hand hygiene, good fitting masks, air filtration systems. even stated get rid plexiglass barriers fact block air flow. course get vaccinated. is, problem. point, quite long time now, long covid, public health establishment decided impact important accuracy.  view, one primary drivers conspiracy theories. convince someone lying one thing, easy convince lying about. join medical profession without least trusting science involved service providing?

Maybe speaks standards allow people practice medicine. reputable information risks associated different vaccines people pre-existing circulatory conditions? main Google results I‚Äôm getting show cause already experience, don‚Äôt say anything whether risks increase significantly people already these. understand virus also cause problems, live alone pet, I‚Äôm hesitant give guaranteed chance potentially fatal reaction (whereas guaranteed get COVID - especially since careful always wear mask, wash sanitize hands, distance, etc).  though? true vaccinated people unvaccinated get admitted hospital. mainly elderly. Many vaccinated shorter hospital stays require ICU. ICU sickest patients.

I can't say sure, since exact data, fact proportions increase 2x admission 5x death strong evidence many vaccinated people end icu. hospital telling go die alley.

Again, mostly statistical artifact broad vaccination program. 2020 wants headline back   ""For ever complex problem, answer simple wrong.""

A rough quote.

You know shit.   FINALLY! Thank you! gonna give til May say screw huge relief! another year waiting see GF me. That‚Äôs quasi-experimental research works. data sets ‚Äúcherry-picked‚Äù, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd higher bias rating, no? US, buy rapid tests use home. $15-25 2 usually, hard find stock. Certainly free.  PPP loans intended help small businesses survive shutdowns closures. business got loan big $600k, likely actually need took hey, free government money.  hope sister recover fast sure. said, it‚Äôs impossible know vaccine work. entirely possible infection would worse, person vaccinated. love trolley dilemma become part everyday language last year 2 ! ;D

So much put bed one 2 pretty simple actions.

reduce pfizer dose half 18's, and/or make single dose, 2 dose regime , preserve moderna girls men 29.

I'm pretty sure cut myocarditis risk 90%, probably havent changed hospitalisation risk covid vaccinated measureable degree.

Some Nordic countries stopped using moderna young males, adn UK, SA, Hong Kong Norway switched single pfizer doses younger cohort (cant remember exactly line drawn country, broadly similar aims) *""They still self-isolate home week""* full shit, would anus ivermectin long majority places Americans live, vaccine available US. I‚Äôd say people Africa (Which general continent low vaccine coverage) needs much more.    Re-exposure antigen (such Spike protein Nucleocapsid protein) would result class switching B-cells IgM IgG. would occur case booster dose vaccine targeting SARS-CoV2 protein, predominant blood antibody would IgG IgM second dose (or reinfection). Additionally, many cases serology would reveal anti-S IgM (or IgG) indicates acquired (adaptive) immunity anti-N IgG IgM indicates prior infection, certain vaccines contain antigens (eg Sinovac)*. 

In case whole-inactive vaccine*, first dose would result humoral response consisting primarily anti-S anti-N IgM. second dose (if enough time given doses), whole-inactive vaccine (or boosters) would result humoral response IgG Nucleocapsid Spike. 

In case whole-inactive vaccine boosted Adenovirus-vectored** mRNA** vaccine (or vice versa), serology would show humoral response IgG Spike IgM response Neucleocapsid antigen. 

*Whole-Inactive vaccines expose BCR N antigens, structural proteins present (in similar manner infection), immunoglobulin tighter reflect ""immunity"" (although anti-S humoral response would protective).

**Adenovirus-Vectored mRNA vaccines primarily used western countries include mRNA-1273 (Moderna), BNT-162b2 (Pfizer), JNJ, ChAdOx-1 (AZ).  studies done. safe levels Ivermectin, doesn‚Äôt anything. Anything beyond toxic COVID person.  Interesting fact: humans animals long term data virus. 

Life scary, making decision making decision. decided would rather kids exposed entire virus it‚Äôs glory inert spike cannot infect them. you‚Äôre concerned myocarditis non reproducing spikes feel millions replicating spikes attaching children‚Äôs cells? risk myocarditis? kids get risk myocarditis higher point ever would vax. don‚Äôt want responsible decision.  Yes, actually. girlfriend elementary school teacher. kid class tested positive, began feel sick staying me. Spent several days her, got doubt. 

Thank well wishes.  ü§¶üèº Mixing vaccines defiantly seems good move - get best everything know got sick? got possibly much time spent around them? 

Hope get better soon. must doctors barely passed med school ""Lee-loo Dallas Multi-Pass! Muuuulti-PASS!"" relative tested positive, one former colleagues, current teacher, told ""I say daily supplement routine probably saved me: Quercetin zinc vitamin C D3. Plus take hydroxychloroquine ivermectin weekly preventative.""

Eat L move on, son. guy 71 years old unvaccinated plus doctor took Ivermectin. think going live this? close talking anti vaxx coworker getting vaccine get fired(I work nursing home). another idiot anti vaxx coworker comes tells fill religious exemption paper. hate people.  downvoted? mentioned article one big confounders.  sister tested positive, girlfriend planning go parents house positive sister lives parents sister. entire household unvaccinated (though tested negative), girlfriend vaccinated. sister quarantining upstairs, I'm assuming family taking precautions keep everything disinfected. probably going parents house Thanksgiving, right? TL;DR  know. Somewhat. Maybe 50%. Maybe not, depending symptoms long.

Since vaccine immunity ""wanes,"" since hosts always natively different immunity vulnerability, since site quantity inoculum highly variable, question can't answered binary. 

Intuitively, less severe degree systemic illness, fewer long-term systemic sequelae. higher inoculum, worse local damage. higher level antibodies systemically, lower systemic damage. 

Anybody specialist expertise welcome weigh in. bet also think could beat polygraph outsmart homicide detective. That's I'm thinking.  would potentially forever limited vaccines exist now, vaccine research continue eventually we'll vaccine finally ends nightmare.   certainly worth discussion, opinion (at moment) ""Not yet"". 6 months ago, thought we'd point now, goddamned delta surge hit, royally pissing off, but...

As original post. unreported breakthroughs happening also means real death hospitalization rates vaccinated folks even lower reported, great news.

But low implied. Since taking reported deaths account. posted. ignoring fact.

Those facts. cases (I'm aware of), negative health effects least couple orders magnitude lower unvaccinated infected.

Shes better always back minds might long term harm her.  point, it‚Äôs like say 7 people got std orgy. doctor attending anti vaccine summit license stripped immediately. get EU member states, [authorization here's list authorized vaccines) yet. Vero Cell Sinovac here, still review.

I think Croatia Hungary EU states use(d) it. 600 / 6,000,000 = 0.01%. words, \~0.01% kids known covid cases died it.

Can provide link assertion statisticians consider 0.01% equivalent zero, implying?

Like said, I'd happily agree ""small,"" I'm aware source considers 0.01% equivalent zero context something causing death. Exactly! literally could believe hearing. said even went seminar it, I'm sure tried use pseudoscientific justifications untrue religious beliefs. think someone goes works healthcare setting conducts scientific method completely enthralled something that's literally true needs true get heaven. really sad. guess lot believe outrun virus forever, scientists share optimism.

Outrunning virus? lot us? already antivaxer even slightly mentioning possibility vaccine risk? I'm well aware potential risks COVID, thing lot mentioned communities discussing post-vaccine health issues. Yeah, mixing things lying, them? Critical thinking case might lead idea cases immune system overreacts vaccine seriously screw things up.  Done! Pfizer oozing pores. article extensively discusses summer seasonality due weather requiring people stay indoors AC, though? assume that? assuming - would assume thinking wouldn‚Äôt die catch virus, especially since treating symptoms caused virus.  well lost 100 pounds think know little bit lol  needed get 70% could go back normal. 80%. crickets.

According 10 countries world higher 80% vaccination rate 17 higher 70%. There's also evidence many countries somewhat overstating vaccination rate, perfect handle true size population.

It case ""almost everyone vaccinated."" previous comment tells sincere this. literally places stand feet 3 4 states once. Like work Kentucky, walk across street lunch Tennessee.

On one hand, know lot people live United States realize big is, like Texas alone nearly 3 times larger whole United Kingdom cluster.

But far borders, get road sign *might* get sign main road says Welcome x-State,"" even that's probably cops know stop :p  Wait. Really? mean seems fine problem, approving without also requiring booster seems short sighted given know now. problem first wave, hand ""wild type"" virus, afterwards much infectious Alpha even aggressive Delta variants. Health officials adapt development, unfortunately makes look foolish now. also means herd immunity harder reach vaccinations cannot prevent infection like would have.

We yet know often we'll need booster shots, maybe every couple years, maybe often. We'll find fighting disease.

The myocarditis risk undeniably there, viruses cause similar issues. Going forward, we'll likely get better drugs treatment improvements disease gets researched, it'll years till problem anymore. using blind faith accept earth 10,000 years old, absolutely scientific fact behind it. turning around science rejects order get paycheck. That's hypocritical. quite interesting numbers comparison Czech Republic (about 1/4 population Poland).
CZ similar number tests (25k), positivity around 37% deaths around 100. Israel indoor mask mandates lasted grand total 10 days. think safe say there's point cancelling mandates we're clear (either contained variants become less severe). second this, along methenamine (available Cystex Azo brands) pain feel UTI coming Strip medical license. I've read developing vaccinations P. acnes bacteria, similar chickens salmonella vaccine. hope see available soon get antibiotics vaccinated running around licking toilet seats like plague never happened. 

Or majority vaccinated dire need booster? 

This multifaceted problem. Seems like covid follow religion Poland. Hopefully figure out. happily agree that, statistically, risk covid kids small.

I guess see part post? Oh endemic thought. lied??  All-time high relative term. put perspective, US 6 times population South Korea 233 times many covid deaths. handled much better outset. That's opinionüòâ  well said! see many people say ""they everything right"" catch COVID admit wearing cloth mask wearing (because still believe completely immune vaccinated) good following rules completely oblivious fact rules wholly inadequate whole time anyone actually serious trying get sick. Isn‚Äôt ironic, dontcha think? wonder plays history reopening actual hospital damaged Sandy eventually settling limited Emergency Department. still full hospital, would likely enough staff keep ER open. unvaccinated doctors certainly seemed think wouldn't. 23 year old male, make sense get booster? I'm worried myocarditis potential bad reaction shot. Also, I'm sure vaccine really cracked be, reading NY Times, year, already deaths last year, vaccine. seems like people getting re-infected COVID, make sense 100k cases day still infected everyone U.S. 

I'll probably get shot, reduce chance severe reaction, want get booster every six months reduce potential severe reaction, severe reaction already unlikely I'm young, wear masks every time go public spaces. just, I'm little frustrated conversation around pandemic ""if people vaccinated, situation would much better"" year, we're worse cases deaths last year, Europe even worse us population vaccinated us. 

I think conversation around COVID, I'm saying true, seasonal like flu, though much severe, vaccines help reduce risk severe disease, potential negative reactions protect much getting virus spreading it, terrible person decide get (though probably best get it). 

I know, think I'm little depressed whole situation. whole pandemic situation make sense me. feel like health officials dishonest they're flip-flopping guidance. hard know believe. Doesn‚Äôt sound awful share source adverse event rate Aspirin? Somebody forgot add DISTINCT(patient, dose) SELECT statement. Yeah. much comments tons upvotes attract get me. c'est la vie. Redditors get mad use /s sarcastic comment someone get ""obviously satire"" post, shit like causes happen. ""Doctor brags taking ivermectin speech World Equestrian Center, contracts COVID"" sounds like something Onion! almost impossible distinguish fact satire least 5 years now. Chapman's awesome company still makes actual ice cream ""frozen desserts"" ""ice milk"" veiled ice cream. factory burned kept paying staff rebuilt.

Anyone upset go eat crap frozen desserts Nestle; deserve it. No, know died COVID, I'm going told.

It's pretty irrelevant I'm worried fact checking I've lied whatever, impact anything. like dangerous anti-vaxx rhetoric repeating would damaging. think obvious I'm going I've told.

As ""inadequate care,"" sure there's assumptions there, talking doctor currently taking Ivermectin prophylactic also prescribing (or otherwise obtaining) wife. guy stated wanted ""spank"" father getting vaccine.

He ""died home,"" pretty natural assumption go hospital care. Now, die home lied to, okay, well ""shame you."" (Not you, you, guy.)

Now, here's something worth pushing back 97 years old. Even vaccine hospital care, still huge probability death.

Define ""huge."" Like 70%+? Good guy Covid Many people want understand simply comparing two risks, comparing lower risk induce vs higher risk something might happen.

I statistician, bet could find one here. Risk often calculated certain period time. leading scientists believe guaranteed every single person earth end COVID one point another future. way everyone (and especially kids) encountered flu. Given information, believe safe say child going either assume smallest risk myocarditis vaccine now, larger risk point future.

Now, also know litany potential side effects come COVID. Less children, plenty posts Reddit parents children lost sense smell taste prolonged period time. Imagine kind eating disorders lead to. mention bunch studies sorts stuff COVID virus potential inflict. still early really know things conclusively potentially years come. definitely signs organ damage, neurological damage, etc. Surely it'll less kids, know while. vaccine however virus attached it, merely part spike protein. literally harmless part virus. potential side effects immune response, virus harm you. assume child encounter virus sooner later, entire things reduced complete brainer.

I guess lot believe outrun virus forever, scientists share optimism. give website information read article, I'm inclined do.

What mean say ""infection real risk vaccine""? impossible people simply admit studies already tell us: vaccinating certain age groups Moderna carries higher risk myocarditis (than vaccinating age groups). numerical risks already reported scientists. Anyone heard new estimates data 2-5 year old vaccine released? necessarily EUA, least data?  Doubt - sitation east Asia countries. Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos .......... never really taken hold like elsewhere. 


Just opposite look south central America - Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Mexico, Colombia, Paraguay (#1, #2, #3, #5, #7 #9 respectively global excess death list). Makes wonder minor genetic difference inhibiting (or not) spread. Omg next level genius right here. Love it. ""Anti-vaccine summit?"" like ""COVID-19 summit."" Come one, come call get free COVID-19. Well... least souvenir bring back share patients, friends family members. worry booster shot. 2-dose vaccination leads decline sterilizing immunity Delta months second dose. UK data, there's still 90% improvement outcomes (CFR 90% lower), case rates much lower. say quite clearly case previous worst VOCs Gamma, breakthroughs tremendously less contagious.

So vaccinated people still driving cases, hospitalizations. Europe higher vaccine uptake older people US does, though, e.g. over-60s vaccinated still expect hospitalizations vaccinated.

Get 6-month third dose. Thank you, came say goddam thing. too. low dose penicillin chronic tonsillitis tween Canada too! Let‚Äôs goooo! Guardian says 2 million estimate. bizarre...  smart ox. I've said people hear cases classified ""mild"", forget healthcare workers often odd definition ""mild"".

It's similar way say ""you may feel small amount pain"", something feels like medieval torture.  hope read article r/facepalm well Great. bad can't donate American citizens living abroad. non residents clause makes absolutely sense. Good.  perhaps ive missed discussion this, anyone know rising cases around europe - it‚Äôs mostly unvaccinated folks? keep seeing like 50% increases countries nothing they‚Äôre vaccinated not. probably tried several prebiotics, brands recommend? Yeah one takes vaccine every day 16 months. did, would definitely get covid though. monetary aspect vaccines seems like scape goat deciding get vaccinated. understand countries handling COVID vaccine free. dude. no. Ummm helplessly trapped nursing home unvaccinated assholes caring them, young children can't vaccinated immunecompromis2d vaxed roll dice everytime maskless asshole breaths near people whose vaccines waning... grifters gonna grift! scientists working fast can, much like vaccines, use inventions work. Continuing isolate (except school) leaving unvaxxed felt like maybe it‚Äôd safe **except school**

That's gotta one biggest sources infection children. risk heart inflammation going much higher going school unvaxxed instead getting vax living full life.

The perspective makes certain amount sense, ultimately choice either way. Choose isolate completely stunt childhood, choose mostly isolate they're already risk covid, choose get vaccine inject extremely small chance side effects directly them. Either first two choices simply wrong based math.

It sounds like made healthy choice them, good news basically reason continue isolating another weeks.   Thank you.  yup, retracted data made bullshit. single handedly killled lot covid prevention research used reference. assholes. 

also dose needed inflammatory effects human would lethal.  International borders non residents (so Canadians Mexicans) bizarre thing people play monetary aspect vaccines. Sure, could give Pfizer $50 vaccine, multiplied hundred million that's lot money. ORRR could give $70 fix broken dick FOUR HOURS, mention rest health problems come covid. it‚Äôs also difficult stand fork road CHOSE something risk.

I've thought lot vaccine decisions like trolley dilemma (related) fat man dilemma.

Giving people vaccines *cause* small number deaths due side-effects, whereas giving *allow* larger number deaths due virus (the gap deaths caused deaths prevented vaccine smaller younger age groups).

In theory, obviously much better cause deaths allow many, lot people hard time making decision. states too, international only? Science denialism promote anti-vax theories  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Nah nursing another level. say PTs PTs ill never complain nurse . Even pandemic  FWIW, exposed Thursday, doubtful they'd highly contagious Saturday... usually 3-5 days exposure becoming contagious... That's obviously hard rule, generally 2 days safe enough.

That said, people like go drinking Wednesday Thanksgiving people could get exposed &amp; contagious Saturday. Yeahhhh fly ton airlines one place really, really harp masks. I‚Äôve shots booster also country set much I‚Äôm never 2 3 weeks negative covid test, never care wearing mask properly. Planes place anyone ever says anything.

Covid different stuff contagious could combated relative ease vaccine wearing piece cloth face things apparently much ask get people literally whining floor assaulting people. Maybe put blame greedy hospital administrators hiring nurses/paying keep market demand. 

We 2 years prepare this. Hospital admins greedy fucks insist running razor-thin margins. 

Also, given fact ""breakthrough"" infections extremely common, maybe rethink vaccine mandates harming everyone surges. Maybe cut pay raise insurance rates like Delta Airlines. putting work hospitals stressed helping anyone. Transfer covid wards make wear full hazmat.

I believe guidance Canada currently everybody get booster yet, based durable immunity. 

While partly response disrupted vaccine supply, remember health authority asserting benefits longer spacing doses. ""If make public claim without basis randomized peer reviewed research, lose medical license.""

I'm sorry, can't agree. Covid lead death, hard randomized study everything.

Recent experience friend group unfortunately raises caveat...

In last three weeks, 12 people friend group tested positive Covid. one fully vaccinated, two already gotten boosters. Even though exposed many them, even sharing cigarette one tested positive next day, managed avoid it... got clipped strep bronchitis days later anyway.

All infected, including one unvaccinated person, mild symptoms mimicked usual seasonal stuff comes around time year, one serious symptoms luckily. 

So vaccinated around mostly vaccinated people, probably fine, still get infected... case, probably still fine besides annoying symptoms come along mild cases Covid. Oh God that's terrifying. can't imagine liking RC Cola. Real talk though, lot sense taste relies sense smell. They're intimately neurologically linked.  Ugh. Poland‚Äôs hospital system really cannot handle big case surges. family healthcare winter going absolute carnage. country reasonably good job managing Covid, people‚Äôs unwillingness get jab going really hurt. known quite smart, highly educated people refused jab, general distrust chemicals medicines. pediatric appointment little one two weeks Thanksgiving... little wear mask.

Watch India closely, safe till April, would hope return normal. find medical expert talk to. circulatory conditions significant covid risk factor.

Fourth, highly doubt would encourage single anti-vaxxer reconsider.

Lather, rinse, repeat. resources massively increased need? Gone, like staffing. bad, y'all.

But good thing declared ""in rearview"" public/media/shitty messaging! means even pittance COVID-related expansion increase assistance going away! studies show protection reinfection strong persists 10 months follow-up,3 unknown long protective immunity truly last.

More 10 actually, since 10 months follow-up. lower bound rather upper bound. problems term ""waning efficacy"" depends look at. 2 shots mRNA vaccines create pretty durable cellular immunity protect severity hospitalizations protection really ""waning"". remains pretty high level around 80-90% protection hospitalization. Right studies cellular immunity double vaccinated people prove pretty solid immunity 6 months+.

If speak antibodies right pretty normal protective antibodies decrease time vaccination infection body want waste ressources create antibodies might needed.

But anyway ""booster"" pretty good thing think viewed ""booster"" ""waning vaccine efficacy"". part general immunization eyes. *Fifth?* get *first?!* say physics/engineering major/graduate without saying one.

Tried googling results ones could find articles February March.  people recovered COVID-19 might benefit COVID-19 fact, one study found previous COVID-19 associated increased adverse events following vaccination Comirnaty BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine addition, rare reports serious adverse events following COVID-19 

I thought recommendation even previously infected individuals vaccinated recovered, whether start vaccine series get booster. government amorphous entity consist Russian citizens? telling me? Don‚Äôt forget mortuary workers! ran space place worked last year. what‚Äôs plan deal labor shortages exacerbated pandemic? You‚Äôre wrong. Michigan awful vaccination rate. 54% population fully vaccinated. Theyre tough times. Eh. CDC's statements really liberal (not political definition word!). said vaccinated people need wear masks. said cloth mask recommended. I'd go 14 days quarantine. What's news recently? 100%.

Jan-Mar 2020 4,000 COVID deaths vaccine available.

Jan-Mar 2021 203,000 COVID deaths vaccine available.

Sure, try explain away saying COVID US Jan-Feb 2020, people access vaccine Mar-Apr 2021, but... wait, taking about? state relation many women miscarry overall? Hey, look recap! Look I'm vaccination mandates problem many people deem extreme, mask mandates best us have. Fast, accurate, cheap; can't pick two. also magically prevent 90% miscarriages vaccinated something. Horrible headline. It‚Äôs getting vaccinated ‚Äúflies away‚Äù ü¶Ü products pretty vanilla - lol pun intended. wouldn‚Äôt translate well international shipments. 

They real premium ice cream think would translate export. Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream example actually best ice cream I‚Äôve ever country. little bits tiny crushed vanilla bean see it‚Äôs incredibly decadent creamy. matter much hate anti-vaxers reasonable person ever suspend medical ethics deny treatment

No matter much pretend status quo acceptable status quo (circular reasoning, course), change fact *your status quo actively killing people*. may ""current medical ethics"" according you, mean situation *moral* need change.

By way, shortage, *someone* denied treatment. currently happening. think people could've easily prevented need treatment priority people took preventative measures simply unlucky. It‚Äôs like game ookie mouth Irony? That's QR codes come play. actually get scanned, link back official state health record, cannot forge.

Sure may resistance. that's good reason it. Ugh right. Even simple ""no,"" sentence would made easier. honestly think fine overall ‚Ä¶ hospital situation is, think needs step up. Except one brain, apparently. St Lukes Woodlands.  really count fifth wave never stopped first one? Everyone fucking coughing darts monday, going one seasons stopped watching around season 2 Least we'll able smell it! ;) people hospitalized Covid

Being hospitalized COVID COVID two different things.   What‚Äôs hospital went to? easily look data. I‚Äôm sure senators already top you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre going around vaccinated people you‚Äôll fine. Vaccines work Okay then. Enjoy cold war era xenophobia. I'll stick empathy fellow man, matter live. Irony lost weak minded. Even though doctor, necessarily mean smart. watched long ago comment helped re-live memory lol Yea can‚Äôt possibly anything unvaccinated people clogging hospitals fully Pfizer vaccinated pt die extended ICU stay last week. 6 weeks hospital 4 weeks intubated. elderly 70s significant comorbidities.

First one I've seen far really sucks. This. right here.

Adults able get vaccinated almost year now. Sucks adolescent vaccine took little longer, I'll say I'm glad FDA wanted absolutely sure safe going forward it. Considering amount people still loudly proudly announcing moronic anti-vax views... last thing need recall something give morons something factual point instead usual BS. clear need yet. said able make appointment see specialist. I've got MRI scheduled early next week, I'll happy report back fast get surgery necessary. Sorry experience fit narrative trying push. IIUC, countries preferring administer Sinovac rather mRNA vaccine children reduced efficacy seemingly countered lower risk serious disease covid-19 well lower risk side effects.

Anyone know enough comment? (I'm aware risk side effects mRNA vaccines much lower risk covid-19 itself.) everyone realise full hospitals bad thing COVID patients, also people need care, time need care? Brace 63947 wave COVID! It‚Äôs gonna nuts! Half people MI haven‚Äôt put guard up.   CDC considers participants AZ one two studies ""fully vaccinated"". booster coming participants study. Yeah months ago case, hopefully stays chill lot things happened never thought would happen - starting around summer 2015. Tell surgery be..:..   Congrats, means ER department running smoothly. Want guess COVID patients kept days? ER.

We're almost two years pandemic point. Hospitals stopped keeping COVID patients ER ages ago, least live. dedicated areas them, usually entire floors surge hits. I'm kinda worried Friendsgiving Saturday. live parents know friends probably see families tomorrow. I'm kinda anxious going. got booster know everyone vaccinated, good feeling wave breakthroughs happening. Lol 95% capacity hospital, 115% icu right state. Normal non covid times usually never 75%.

The icu utilization real problem tho. Wonder affect schools considering going back online tested positive yesterday(at home test) going take legit test today. Wife also positive. vaccinated. Symptoms kinda brutal managing far. 

We 8 3 year old. tested negative question would safe go grandparents house quarantine? anymore. I've hated state long time now. Yeah baby, killing 10-15 people day know made three posts refused. honest, seems like made mind already vaccines work. believe true, asked response, mine. Vaccines work lower amount severely ill patients ICUs, filling beds. fine want believe it, data there. CDC posted it, complete pretty graphs make easy even understand. filling beds unvaccinated people.  
Then, time went on, heard Israel seeing waning vaccine's efficacy. new vaccine, way know long would stay effective. already seeing breakthrough infections, honest, never knew type vaccine breakthrough cases received. Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine 77% effective get-go, many people chose anyway due ""one done"" dosing, distrust mRNA technology, fact Johnson &amp; Johnson trusted household brand name. suspect many breakthrough cases J&amp;J recipients...but one disclosed data, cannot prove that.   
Now vaccines waning, seeing breakthrough cases again, underlying conditions could worsen Covid joining unvaccinated people ICU. addition Covid patients, though, people delayed treatment chronic conditions needing beds also conditions worsened sheltering home, fearful putting risk sit doctor's office.  Hence, asking people get boosters. Boosters restoring efficacy Israel, believe help US well people get them.   
The problem is, hard enough get many vaccinated actually roll sleeves, know willingly get booster. hope will, personally, especially underlying conditions would make Covid non-survivable them. want anyone die this. understand 60 million people US still vaccinated.  
As question go back normal...I see near future could ever return fully 2019-living without risk. predict masking distancing always us manner long-term. fan mandates, think personal responsibility works either. expect people use personal responsibility mitigate virus many even believe threat? people still think virus hoax nothing flu. story Italy week man nearly died attending Covid Party, intentionally getting infected, still said afterwards didn't' think Covid real thought normal pneumonia. ever reach semblance normal many people world cannot understand viruses work? one thing people denied Covid they, themselves, never known person fall ill die Covid. people barely survived Covid infections saying still believe it. move forward type thought?

So hope answers questions three attempted posts. wish well, hope stay safe, celebrate Thanksgiving, hope beautiful one.  Polis seems adopted attitude ""You know doing, it."" He's mostly washed hands whole thing. IIRC got point various governments threatening take Australia sort UN complaints process thousands Australians whose legal time India expiring able return home due government's policies.

Indoors higher infection risk aswell. open spaces, distance people, masks, open windows etc reduces risk infection. still Covaxin waits. lots principles psychology get this.

The biggest culprit availability heuristic. People overestimate frequency things based frequently hear about. People afraid sharks thunder storms, lightning kills way people sharks (like 20 times people).


No disease news lifetime like COVID vaccine important. People concerned side effects seek information side effects, constantly expose articles COVID side effects. people writing articles get clicks.

In conspiracy sub, there's thread every day ""My healthy 45 year old neighbor got vax suddenly died heart attack three weeks later.""

Well, even COVID vaccine thing, healthy 45 year olds suddenly died heart attacks. Weird stuff happens. people making threads it. 

That's anecdotes data can't point forum threads proof something happening often. putting anything pause right now, definitely booster.  understand virus keep infecting people, killing them, mutating. Possibly something current vaccines ineffective against. go back square one. 

But enough people stopped childish assholes got vaccines would fewer people virus live mutate. 

So pro vaccine anti mandate plain moronic.  shit, people catch respiratory virus often they're indoors? lower levels

Lower yes zero.
This antibody titer one aspect it, immune system complex. also learning process involved body produce best fitted antibodies parts immune system besides antibodies get trained. record might got seen someone quickly, doesn‚Äôt mean hospital isn‚Äôt slammed. wanna make bet, bet call make appointment anything specialized hospital ( see dermatologist elective surgery ) looking minimum 5 months out.      Vaccine shedding? No, take medication prophylactically shot. suggested even possibly reduce efficacy. That's good. assure like last Covid wave. We're lull right even cases seemingly started tick back up. Let's hope ""winter wave"" (which I'm entirely sold on), severe time around terms hospital burden. real problem. People died get ""elective"" surgeries done.  willing escrow money make bet. papers showing location times. Saturday night, hospital Houston, TX. Nobody waiting seen.  shared experience, ER Saturday night infection see another patient. Seen doctor within minutes walking in. Hospital Houston, TX.  especially emergency cancer surgery. notice patient bed left watching techs bundle used his/hwe roommate? That's harsh. much water harmful you. Ingest water improperly, kill you.

But inanity aside, ivermectin neurotoxin. Everything said 100% true accurate, dug rhetoric willing admit otherwise. Gotcha. heard health passes generated US states New York New Jersey compatible EU system, idea someone supposed they‚Äôre states. states even banned concept vaccine passports! It‚Äôs insanity parts country. mean couple months ago hospitals shutting entire floors (surgery, sleep labs, etc.) move staff create entirely new Covid wards. Right we're bad last delta spike. seem implying overloaded hospitals sort media creation assure not. Unexpected really hope you‚Äôre sarcastic lol want learn circumvent paywall, see Or, website regularly read, think subscribing website.  Hmmmm. Intriguing nope. manufactured anti-vaxx ignorance. like 2% Americans insignificant.  charts based Covid cases older groups since boosters rolled say stop people getting Covid. Covid, even breakthrough cases, unpleasant potentially deadly. no-brainer get one.

As future, know yet long boosters last. might last lot longer 6 months. might even get longer lasting vaccines soon, already say hopeful, patient, novel virus changing goalposts new variants etc, best minds globally working this. It‚Äôs news story. What? How? real concern vaccine induced myocarditis young males. everyone else, risk factor much lower. article specifically risk children.  never thought vaccines would used manipulation control vulnerable people continuing get sick (and many die long term issues) COVID.

There reason US position. Jesus Christ Hanford stop embarrassing might work CA already ""bug stations"" borders monitor produce foliage allowed state. empowered, could request vaccination cards presented. think it'll happen, already people working borders (at least CA, sure states East) stop question you. saw comment elsewhere ‚Äî one ‚Äúthe study‚Äù within paper. two. 50% reduction, also one found 0% reduction. reeks BS. Also wife‚Äôs emergency doctor, hospitals slammed.  hospital hospitals around Minnesota full already. Good luck, guys. That‚Äôs one linked studies within paper. found effect. think it‚Äôs fair mention both. excluding one excluding literally 50% evidence within paper. suprised since almost half U.S. complete idiots thinking vaccine deadly. 

I live SC almost people morons comes health vaccination. checked couple names. licensed Florida. COVID, GONE! mislead everyone skewing young males. supposed year vaccines brought pandemic control. Instead, people United States died Covid-19 year died last year, vaccines Tuesday, Centers Disease Control Prevention recorded 386,233 deaths involving Covid-19 2021, compared 385,343 2020. final number year higher, month left takes time local agencies report deaths also accounted higher percentage U.S. deaths year last year: 13 percent compared 11 say higher death toll result confluence factors: crucially lower-than-needed vaccination rates, also relaxation everyday precautions, like masks social distancing, rise highly contagious Delta public health experts said, many Americans behaving though Covid-19 manageable, endemic disease rather crisis ‚Äî transition happen eventually happened many also refusing get vaccinated numbers required make transition scientists call ‚Äúendemicity,‚Äù would mean virus would still circulate lower level periodic increases decreases, spike devastating cycles characterized pandemic. 59 percent Americans fully vaccinated, lowest rate Group 7 unfortunate situation high level vaccine coverage basically, places, return normal behaviors put people greater risk coming contact virus,‚Äù said Jennifer Nuzzo, epidemiologist senior scholar Johns Hopkins Center Health Security. ‚ÄúIf take protections whatsoever, virus capable moving faster dangerous gaps immunity, adds to, unfortunately, lot continued serious illness Celine Gounder, infectious disease specialist Bellevue Hospital Center, estimated roughly 15 percent U.S. population might immunity prior infection, strong durable immunity people also vaccinated, even assuming two groups didn‚Äôt overlap 74 percent Americans level immunity, still would enough end pandemic, said Dr. Gounder. would probably take 85 90 percent vaccination rate make coronavirus endemic, vaccines rolled out, people minds said, ‚ÄòCovid over,‚Äô‚Äù Dr. Gounder said. ‚ÄúAnd even enough people vaccinated, behavior returned ‚Äî least people ‚Äî normal, changing behavior increase news outlets reported last week confirmed 2021 deaths surpassed 2020 deaths. reports stemmed counts deaths based deaths reported, happened ‚Äî meaning deaths late 2020 counted early 2021. C.D.C. counts, show mark reached week, accurate based dates death certificates. can‚Äôt relate Covid, many women‚Äôs taste/smell changes pregnancy. Sometimes even it‚Äôs returned normal, certain foods never like again. Ah ¬´top¬ª virologist predicted wouldnt second wave... problem vector vaccine uses another virus deliver RNA. means get produce antibodies covid, also produce antibodies virus.

Normally get long lasting protection get booster dose. problem 2nd dose might effective, body might neutralize adenovirus anything.

So Astra Zeneca decided give 2nd dose anyway, Sputnik V decided use different adenovirus 2nd dose, that's costlym looks like going route AZ Sputnik Lite. J&amp;J decided turn disadvantage feature said vaccine single dose.

But antibody levels wanes J&amp;J vaccine looks worst. looks like would single dose vaccine. didn‚Äôt like this. 

The unvaccinated holding rest world hostage, especially devolved nations enough vaccines choose use them. 

If unvaccinated dying significantly fewer people would care, they‚Äôre hurting rest world pound sand. Right..and covid list.

Nothing full-proof, it‚Äôs clear rarely negatively affects little kids. So, suggest - like Israel pre-print study couple months ago - natural immunity lasts longer vaccination immunity.

Yet, even today, unvaccinated people make VAST majority hospital patients. 85-90% worst.

These two statements line me. hard time believing many unvaccinated idiots - year - never acquired COVID past weeks.

The timeline add up. preexisting condition required covered ACA.  see interview. said jest, 

""We heard Covid toe"" 

""Ya thats is"" *laughs*. 

Later goes say ""bone issue"" pinky toe. burst laughing work comment everyone looking funny.  evidence Delta causes.more severe disease children. transmissible

You can't call 'pre print' dismiss studies show conclusions seem like, reason  dad recently breakthrough infections (my dad two dose Moderna, two dose Pfizer). Neither us lost sense taste smell, breathing issues. Terrible cough/sore throat. I‚Äôm basically recovered 4-5 days symptomatic illness. dad still fighting off. Meanwhile, five year old daughter contracted week approved vaccines age group. She‚Äôs recovered 100%. 

It point. We‚Äôre going exposed this. breakthrough infections. fight off. unvaccinated fare worst. state particular, metrics WAY worse time last year, winter spike began Halloween. Might Ivermectin hoof. Usually... covid people get bucked E.R. a.s.a.p. second test pops... 

Sooooo yeah, post e.r. treatments payment denied....

Totally legal. Ruins strong word. Maybe. Tbh answers concerning importance healthy gut biome. Third Moderna shot last week immunity starting 11/29 2 weeks, 3 months minimum (assuming worst case follows antibody curve second shot) high level immunity get winter surge. Oh, many people *care* effects alright dim-witted make mental connection vaccine compliance, masks social distancing one hand supply chain shortages, higher prices ICUs filled capacity other. 

The people *are* bracing fifth wave people concerned effects societal level - much individuals categories enumerated. Pre-print study nearly 5 months ago, Delta gained significant foothold US many places across world. 

If study revisions version peer reviewed, would like see that. today, version study holds little water. youngest got COVID 2 weeks first shot. close! Luckily symptoms 2 days-fever, runny nose, GI upset. half class COVID moment. It‚Äôs stressful parent, heart goes small kids right now.   Yes emergency room care still needed. Often time o2 get intubated one can't themselves. need monitored o2 tank needs change 1 last long especially 100%  you‚Äôre medical field you‚Äôre vaxed, suck it‚Äôs choice. 

Fuck that. able vaxed aren't, problem. choice. Pretty sure it‚Äôs still pandemic currently data bad covid vaccinated pregnant women? articles find mostly say pregnant women get vaccinated (and bad unvaxxed pregnant women). Thanks! dystopia remember battle cry rally bees fight Article still downplays rapid antigen tests.

These almost always tell infectious, maybe missing cases lower end. catch vast majority, seems likely cases miss less infectious. Huge win.

And sadly pressure family doesn‚Äôt work :/ don‚Äôt ask know. Last January, anyone think deaths would still rolling along 1,000 plus day? Deaths lower last year even assuming vaccines weren‚Äôt available March. Even bit stretch vulnerable got protected first- even beforeMarch hope dont need hospital next month so. ""nearly all"" gross exaggeration 

\- Many fatalities early 2020 became infected vaccine available public, initially at-risk.

\- Supply issues made tough many higher age brackets vulnerable groups, first groups made eligible, get vaccinated quickly early 2020.

\- vaccine become available adults 50 states late April (some allowed 

It takes 2 weeks 2nd MRNA vaccines take full effect. Meaning around late May even everyone got first shot April. Yea, imagining effective vaccines, deal Delta variant.  isn‚Äôt staring face care, though.

Vaccines available better part year.

Boosters available weeks/months kick basically immediately.

I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôm boosted. made sure loved ones too. able gather things love year?

By way, booster reduces chance symptomatic infection 95% *relative fully vaccinated (two dose) people*. reduces chance symptomatic infection like 98% vs totally unvaccinated person. tribal politics trumps everything now. People turned religion sole purpose life downside essentially zero. upside potentially high. Maybe heartless time revisit triage hospitals. best chance tended lowest survival chance kept comfortable treated time.

Anyone vaccinated goes lawn wait free room everyone vaccinated gets see doctors nurses first since vaccinated higher survival rate unvaccinated. 

Also unvaccinated get unemployment health insurance must pay medical bills pocket.

They right refuse vaccine society right punish it, shirt shoes Vax service. refused service lack shoes refused service lack vaccine.  dtudy control group concluded children get long  know award silver, gold, right here. many people vaccine immunity natural immunity previous infections, another wave? nearly 80-90% people antibodies? times triage used decide someone deserves treatment based condition, likelihood survival.

Exactly, factor think person deserving. proved point exactly. Well fair unlikely Canada deaths 2021 2020. curious too. J&amp;J got moderna booster Monday.  week read interesting analysis paper:

Subramanian, S.V. Kumar, A. (2021) Increases COVID-19 unrelated levels vaccination across 68 countries 2947 counties United States. Eur. J. blog post showing data adjusted wealth correlation. also highlighted, different approach county level data used force certain results.

I can't find anywhere online. Neither sub anywhere else. thread original study, shared findings, blog post mentioned

Has anyone seen send link? Sure apply emergency room someone life danger emergency care needed. basically happening someone needs Covid medical care. gonna new normal, it?

Because amount people gonna get boosters regularly probably gonna less 50%, we're gonna see surges every year healthcare systems strained time time again

And it'll get worse since healthcare workers get burned out, reduces capacity. nightmare  trying relate situation specifically Roll tide  agree. I'm pro vaccine pro lockdowns/masks necessary. several friends medical industry insane I'm happy part make jobs easier. However ongoing time now, people Australia opportunity get vaccinated. point say fuck it, open flood gates? nursing situation ridiculous. I'm high vaccine area, less impacted areas, still severe shortage experienced nurses. 

My friend finished school started working nurse right beginning covid. 6 months later charge nurse working covid unit. around year meltdown bullshit administration pulled comfort care patients. stepped charge, making another new nurse take charge. hospital worried going quit together, gave raise keep her.

The nursing situation bad. ............

When first one ever end? I‚Äôll curious see results Pretty much last year. think might use way way lets save face.

Admitting spent year seriously wrong everything hard.

Pretending (even necessary) new thing waiting along much easier. Remember talk healthcare / frontline workers ""heroes""?

Rule thumb - whenever politicians start calling heroes, probably get screwed  Unless plan force antivaxxers vaccinated good it‚Äôs going get. Well sure, even NYC say Brooklyn like 62% fully vaxxed. Ah yes, I, American, agree wholeheartedly values decisions made every president official think accurate representation am.

/s obvious  Brilliant, unvaccinated demographically lower income withholding sweet refund check would impactful.  Yes, using kindly basing around polite would frankly effective outright deny care, that's unethical me.

That get back alley coat hanger invermectin. work life insurance better believe we're ready increase claims. wish joking. tested positive yesterday. I'm fully vaccinated left house last week go food shopping pick pizza. wore mask places, people getting pizza mask. I'll bet one unvaccinated COVID. five minutes.

I symptoms, got tested visiting family Thanksgiving. Even taking precautions, still catch it. going around lot people get tested. don‚Äôt get anti-WFH mindset, all. company wants us back full time, currently we‚Äôre ~2 days week office. setup since late summer, I‚Äôve already sick twice (not COVID). I‚Äôm vaxxed, wear mask except seated desk. I‚Äôve stayed home 2 weeks time, inevitably I‚Äôm someone coughing snotting blaming HVAC allergies. frustrating. link great! I‚Äôve wanting see exactly got even hoped for. consult graph. first wave long hills = waves Walmart selling two 14, sold pretty quickly. sucks end testing often we'd like fear access really get sick. Final HUGE factor - delta variant year. Delta variant 2020 would catastrophic. Original variant 2021 would pretty much done wealthy countries. Yeah 5 Million plus people died mention permanent damage body suffer even survive.
Get vaccinated Oh it‚Äôs me! It‚Äôs someone coming house I‚Äôm comfortable I‚Äôm trying minimize risk vulnerable significant impact. Delta variant without vaccines would catastrophic. Also, tons deaths right start year, vaccines. appears taking approach posts several real articles (nothing strictly pro-vac, real news reports people protesting vaccine mandates reaction pieces) slips stuff like fullfact.org one receives quite opposite full facts. casual eye appear like he/they simply posting wide variety info health issues, fact it‚Äôs dangerous misinformation disguised sea neutral pieces pay lip service objective. mother told way death rate keeps up, around 4000 deaths month. No, delta. getting kids. page breaks down. Germany far anyone aware.

B.1.1.529 **possibly** infectious / able evade vaccines, sign spread widely outside Southern Africa, might responsible massive up-tick cases had.

Germany likely showing vaccines limited long term protection without boosters.  actually 2 worry plane. people get trouble keeping masks adults. Flight attendants going ask birth certificate  may meant way, eradicating COVID. stay. That's fair, though TBH following closely enough know Canada compares US. referencing that, based admittedly anecdotal evidence, seems like people got impatient abandoned protective measures soon vaccines became widely available. understanding vaccines masks need widespread adoption order really desired effect. anecdotal observation masking public dropped point near-uselessness outside areas actually enforced, know vaccination numbers reached thresholds proposed herd immunity breakpoints. Thus, surprise numbers worse year. People wait plan B fully place stop plan A. need start cooking maybe AMA convincing infuriating treat patients refuse safe highly effective COVID-19 vaccines widely freely available U.S., doctors keep mind professional ethical obligations. turns extensive guidance situation.
‚ÄúEthics profession making hard choices face conflicting values,‚Äù said AMA President Gerald E. Harmon, MD. ‚ÄúAn important value me‚Äîand inherent within AMA Code Medical Ethics‚Äî[is physician‚Äôs duty provide care patient, even choice good question dont know. Ive heard experts say protection serious illness lasts 12 months least. would love see source though. protection 12 hospitalization, hold booster. dont know. know 6 months best time get booster. Heck starting know shots shouldnt 3 weeks apart yet still way.

I currently 8 months moderna. Debating booster. Really want see data. much antibodies dropped? know? Prove people live anything, nobody cares anymore, even numbers go 10x people would fine since March 2020, whole bunch people dying Lord knows see Winter 2022 possible new variants, people used covid thing nobody cares anymore Double rate Massachusetts half rate Minnesota. Slightly UK, hit hard minimum plateau since summer delta wave.

Being boosted mask-wearing, I'm fearful was, I'm going much socializing February. incredibly frustrating. It‚Äôs confusing. 
They fully vaccinated immunity wanes. don‚Äôt know waning called. look place posting, clear sarcasm commonplace. But, you, I'll add /s original Yes delta showing might &amp; force That's kindly means used manner got booster time you! Congrats, internet stranger! paid \~$20 two pack needed get some, looking multiple stores. Ah ok. That's gonna 'meh' fully vaxxed look graphs case numbers, clear comes waves expect able find bed dying relative. pitiful thing witness people die alone, others get care need resources GONE, are. next day, next day, next day, next day, next day, next day, next day, next day, next day, next day, next day, Fellow South Carolinian here. live certain heavily populated coastal city places requiring masks enter, haven‚Äôt implemented measures since mask mandates lifted months back. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve show proof vaccination anywhere since got vaxxed back spring $14 two pack? 0,80‚Ç¨ summer Germany currently 1,70‚Ç¨. Well, find them.

Not mention antigen testing free testing centers over. 4 hours later nothing far. side effects shot 1 2 April/May. three Pfizer Sure know ahead time need one. That's always case  took scroll history he's mostly posting debunking/fact checking articles like one. make tests free again? hate people assume wearing masks unvaccinated.

It's often opposite.

I get vaccinated could ""enjoy"" grocery shopping without mask, friends dates family.

Dropping mask mandates complete utter bullshit. wife (unvaccinated) gave birth healthy full term 8lb baby boy. best friend‚Äôs wife (vaccinated) water break 9 weeks early gave birth 4lb baby girl. NICU while. sure coincidence grateful healthy baby. Avg. 8,502/day bad math. Vaccines wanna work anymore Hmmm, like saying 99% people catch die cv19? really bad hit areas vaccination rate low, Saxony state lowest rate around 56%, Bavaria 60% that's plenty people left... 
Especially since Delta seems affect people bit younger. Last winter elderly died, people 70 80, people fifties thought young healthy enough need vaccine. top problem decreasing immunity especially among elderly (i live city has, again, bad outbreak nursing home, hundred people infected far 14 dead...). Mail order prescriptions thing Vaccinated people still get covid. vaccine doesn‚Äôt work without virus body. simply lessens severity symptoms body better knows fight off. 

If 100% people vaccinated, 100% cases vaccinated. Pretty similar me. felt good Monday, Tuesday wanted sleep entire day. great though. AK cases dropping finally. I‚Äôm actually less worried months ago know exactly handle people properly.

My dad pulled that. First case recognized 13 days ago, November 11. give another historical example: use sterilize women society decided unworthy children believed reproducing would harm society.

So... saying medical ethics reevaluated point, medical practices changed? Because, like said, considered ""ethical"" one point, ""unethical"" later. may correct initially believed sterilizing women prevented harm society, - let sink - *the reason practice stopped collectively decided harmful society.* never re-evaluated ethical practices time, they'd still sterilizing women, right? Thanks providing example bolsters position. 90% less bad unvaccinated pregnant women. Catching diseases pregnant never good idea (but getting vaccinated getting booster doses pregnant generally always is). got booster yesterday Moderna kicking ass. spent last night reacting exorcist today still feel like mild flu. Barely reaction first two shots. everyone else fair? many people care anymore

Exactly this. I'm vaccinated. Everyone give shit vaccinated. I'm certainly longer going inconvenience cater fucks choose unvaccinated. me, pandemic functionally (though drive bit carefully wave peaks). Yeah, say this. one cares anymore except hyper-vigilant people held legal requirement.      Lol fuck we‚Äôre Enjoy spike brain  Never heard news. It‚Äôs number non vaccinated people (up 40% worst hit state) non-existing strict rules week got Moderna booster (after Pfizer). avoided getting sick far, hoping Moderna booster keeps way.

There sub  Cool, cares good boy, went Wendy's even got frosty.

you deserve man. 

i'm gonna try get booster friday think. trying get work done/get 3 person thanksgiving first. Hopefully suck bad, i'm kinda figuring i'll messed day 2. Sorry got dealt blow \*in smaller extent  know cool shit NovaVax options always good. gets people jab. Let's see anti vaxxers show roll sleeves one promised they'll move goal posts again. Covid Well considering hospitals get overwhelmed due uh yes worried cause need actual care may become problem. Mind blown obvious. many people thoughtless? Yeah one other. I'd pretty pissed country decided use tax dollars send vaccines elsewhere vaccinating kids. easily time. western nations abundance vaccines sitting go waste. Looking Canada stop promising donate doses actually already. fertilizer tulips. I'm glad hear relieves tension home hope help spread message. people choose vaxxed stupid reasons, time happens scientific (though I'm sure never read study lol) believe official psychological term ""who fu k cares die, me"" tell us likely unlikely given person infected COVID-19 one point, *will ultimately die something COVID -19*.

Even we're young, healthy, immune today, mean we'll still young, healthy, immune 30 years.

COVID-19 today #3 leading cause death. Unless something happens change that, lot us going die COVID-19 eventually. No, both. Belgium 75% vaccinated hospitals still overrun. unvaccinated also, small majority, old fully vaccinated people underlying conditions. 65% hospital admissions vaccinated people. could vaccines maintain relatively good protection severe disease, fading well... (probably smaller protection).

A booster luxury absolute necessity 65+. I'm sorry we're seeing two doses enough prevent older people hospitalized. sucks is. Guess 6th one happen christmas new years author known snake oil seller. clear way author demonstrated ""test score"" translating real world diseases. Yea heard it‚Äôs pointless follow along season 2 3 Yeah I've working home 20 months limited social engagements smaller group friends. become obvious going way life going forward people decide level risk willing accept. long hospitals town overloaded plan getting often next year. BTW, I'm vaxxed boosted. So...is even passing phase 2b/3 HERALD trial evaluating CVnCoV vaccine candidate met prespecified success criteria efficacy symptomatic COVID-19 severity (lower limit 95% CI efficacy moderate-to-severe COVID-19 (lower limit 95% CI defined protocol. guidelines recommend lower bound least 30% vaccine efficacy least 50%.15 Vaccine efficacy COVID-19 severity 48¬∑2% (95¬∑826% CI 31¬∑0‚Äì61¬∑4) overall primary efficacy analysis set SARS-CoV-2-naive participants.

Anyone care elaborate? OP's account 3k comment karma comments worth 3k (literally two existing comments), likely purchased account get around posting filters.

Also, fact spread information literally username, u/bidens_takin_my_guns

Report loser covid misinformation. old folks remembered life changing public inoculation polio tbh.  parents 30+ ppl thanksgiving. attending bears. conclusion literally previous infection equivalent vaccination. Sounds like legitimate scientific reason me, excuse.

Do know something top medical researchers Lancet don't? prefer follow science one. Hopefully run ventilators get Oh definitely people still coming around vaccine. Lots people bought nonsense ""untested"" hedging long enough know whether widespread side effects. 

Now year, concerning trends side effects emerged, ""vaccine hesitant"" longer hesitant. ones need keep pushing at. Ah I‚Äôm jealous. got Pfizer booster CDC approved mixing matching. wishing waited could‚Äôve gotten Moderna booster!   So, ignore pandemic away?

I tried that. tried pretend life back normal. willing go now, things fundamentally different now, feel like people generally less happy. Phoenix wish ice cream better. fluffy good them. Isn‚Äôt also human scream is?  Yeah, back April. Well, also means spent around 60-70% lives lockdown since covid happened. things closed 7 months last year. also always masks indoor places (which honestly small inconvenience greater good). honestly, sucks always lockdown. winning virus. failing.  Snake oil seller trying get folks buy products? Among unvaccinated.

These headlines serving public good anymore. need shift post-vaccine mindset here. Vaccinated people large hospitalized anywhere near rates refused shot. ""Personal choice"" coming home roost.  Vaccine grant full immunity though, there's still chance (very reduced) get symptoms way less intense unvaccinated.

But yeah, still chance. Unfortunately there's vaccine 100% efficiency rate Inb4 blow darts. I've spent much time talking antivaxxers. afraid side effects, ignore covid worse outcomes people. Almost 40% people lasting effects covid level! believe includes fraction dies.

I think fear taking minimal risk avoid future risk road. basically marshmallow thing kids. ""You one marshmallow now, two five minutes"".

And gut reaction ""you can't tell do"". think pressure get vaccinated fishy, best metaphor people begging get burning building.

I actually met microchip 5Gers person, that's I'm luck. definitely there, minority.  I‚Äôm kind sick people invalidating feelings this. Life significantly crap before, even perception. We‚Äôre still pandemic, constantly changing guidelines, looks like it‚Äôll way long, long time.

A lot people suggesting essentially ignore away, I‚Äôm willing able that. That's said almost half. article? would curious. Steven Gundry‚Ä¶. Plant Paradox Steven Gundry? ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt eat legumes‚Äù Steven Gundry? Yup. I've lost much faith humanity since start pandemic... possible immune system took care re-exposure got worse. Harvard study, found 0 reinfections among 300 healthcare workers, likely Independently, found re-infection among prior COVID-19, contributing **74,557 re-infection-free person-days,** adding evidence base robustness naturally acquired That's probably worst thing do. send kids grandparents, want keep grandparents safe.  Masks don‚Äôt ‚Äústop‚Äù spread either, slow it. like vaccines. Nothing 100% stop anything. would surprised? obvious. see Canadian, already obvious you. mean, honestly? would me. Working home practical, wear n95 mask indoors anywhere family one friends place, avoiding going anywhere needed. id argue overweight somewhat contagious different way. fat people comfortable people fat. parents policy people unvaccinated houses. heard one aunt coming Christmas visit parents, shocked. asked mom finally changed aunt‚Äôs mind. brother died Covid. literally took someone dying wake up. aunt nurse paramedic. She‚Äôs 50s stay home mom past 15 years. still would thought she‚Äôd know better medical education Wow, that's leap. There's hoax, friend, frustrated man wishes people would collectively pry head ass. time report, changes persist least 2.5 months post second dose mRNA vaccine.

So might go away own?

Also, already know several conditions much worse actual virus compared mRNA vaccines. none test subjects become infected? wonder would look scoring system. Probably lot worse. could find another profession, options AB asked feds get think. Well, love ivermectin, problem new pill. Right? *Right*? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm anti vaxxer, *but*‚Äù

Can‚Äôt tell many times I‚Äôve heard Well‚Ä¶.I guess upside federal government willing go help them?  invented new thing called ""phone"" . combine whacky shit called ""curbside pickup."" low intelligence Americans never ceases amaze me. Antivaxx, racists, crazy gun laws, anti-women‚Äôs rights, anti-LGBTQ‚Äôs, anti-intellectualism. It‚Äôs like Americans constantly want go back Stone Age. Bingo. Obamacare increase mouth funnel dollars flowing into. nothing quality cost end.

For-profit ""health care"" abomination. article:
 ‚Äú time closely monitored analysed, reason get overly concerned unless starts going frequency near future.‚Äù hospitalized likely unvaccinated immunologically naive.

The CDC estimates 140 million people recovered COVID, million haven't. Even 25% least 50 million people, 1% get hospitalized 500k people. Yeah nobody Brooklyn neighborhood except even wears masks anymore. Regardless laws mandates. Everyone pretending virus exist Looking sarcasm implies mocking entire concept ""waves"", probably think whole thing media hoax. least, that's usually see sarcasm used. Same. hoping would fully vaccinated end year. I'm due day kid #2, we're prepping lock first months since winter looks like resemble last. kind people need traced tend willing speak contact tracers.

Then sit quarantine 30 days till longer contagious.  YSK Russia Today broadcasts stuff like Russia simultaneously broadcasting massive antivax-propaganda German Russia Today Germany. Putin playing dirty. Russian Covidiots quoting Putin's antivax stuff RTG gospel lol. backfired.  Let's try hop passes like brothers kids

Wooo Sounds plausible, especially since Muslim women wear fabric across face public, obviously means knew advance virus. dont know country US/Canada places live work one cares someone testing positive anymore. though read post... even headline. agree, although think lot people forget J&amp;J pretty effective pre-Delta. Delta made one dose vaccine (even m-RNA ones) enough. really fault J&amp;J, moreso unfortunate circumstances. Fewer fewer hospital workers bracing. We‚Äôre leaving droves. It‚Äôs fault everyday Russians ones die. Comments like wanna-be hardos dumb. I'm afraid mistaken statistics work.

99% survival rate mean everyone 99% die rolling. 1% die randomly selected; much older worse underlying health conditions.

So survive younger healthier also strong protection according study. probability surviving next year due COVID way higher 99%. someone dealing various kinds mental effects advice:

1. Take charge life incorporate normalcy much can-go restaurants, bars, travel etc
2. Move place minimal restrictions vaccination-If resources
3. Associate people willing embrace normalcy. associate folks constantly anxious irrationally paranoid vaccination-Its worth it. dont live forever. would expect would come court civil rights issue Season 3 looking lot like season 2. keep I'm going stop watching. wish Americans could get QR pass could travel Europe easily. I'd rather share UK data. makes bleak reading. evidence even possible, is, it‚Äôs extremely low-risk. group people close quarters catching whole weekend. likely spread way COVID normally spreads, inhalation respiratory droplets. care affects directlt ain't wrong call someone got C's med school? Doctor. Considering current evidence, not? Bold strategy get vaccinated  don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre getting numbers from, measles requires 95% vaccinated herd immunity kick delta transmissible measles, stands reason need something super high like 95% well **Nov. 24, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

I‚Äôve never heard that, maybe do. haven‚Äôt needed get tested yet, I‚Äôve never seen one store. understand narrative.

Half people Michigan desperately trying catch covid pass family thing is, don‚Äôt care. probably late fix hospital situation. many fucking antivax morons destroying society. Covid survivors keeping hospitals full well. Facebook Fox News. really hard grasp. Hey neighbor, also Jersey here...

I know part state live in, Covid respiratory infections going gangbusters around part North Jersey.

In last three weeks, 12 friends tested positive covid, one unvaccinated. Two already received boosters. Since close contact nearly shortly tested positive, nervously counting days turn. started feel sick last Thursday, thus far tested negative 3 rapid tests two PCR's, something else ended getting (ended strep + bronchitis) Covid tagged others. 

On top that, pattern emerged ended testing positive. symptoms matched whichever seasonal malady usually get time year, allergies, others Sinusitis, another fatigue headaches. tested negative first started feeling off, cases days sure, seeing negative results believing usual seasonal bullshit, kept coming events going bar Saturdays. finally tested positive got tested abundance caution heard others around tested positive recently.

&amp;#x200B;

So, take grain salt. I'm saying cancel Friendsgiving plans, definitely keep mind try careful got people home want put risk. said anything us, daycare swim lesson center places bring though. think airlines would say something I'm mostly worried about.  read starts kick around 9 days, takes longer reach full effectiveness.     important get booster Moderna? Everything seen says Moderna‚Äôs protection significantly higher 6 month mark Pfizer vaccine. Moderna really given schedule Pfizer know yet?

How long booster last? 6 months longer? know yet?

I young area without much Covid cases falling here. area hospitals getting overwhelmed cases rising quickly, would get booster try strengthen herd. Still wish we‚Äôd require pcr domestic flights. sir. That's like chiming blm post saying,but lives matter. clearly missing point narrative.  I'm going get downvoted but, largely agree.

That said, worked nursing home residents basically stayed isolated houses ten residents. one outbreak every one one got sick 8 9 vaccinated.

Breakthroughs happen. Blaming Russian government fair game, don‚Äôt shit entire Russian population. Completely correct. third dose also raises number memory cells, antibodies.   planning getting J&amp;J booster. First shot March. J&amp;J really bad? attach search me?

Unfortunately humans work. Ugh, right?!?! freaking everything. General Mills Nabisco strikes really drove home many brands us even realize, too. frustrating try shop ethically see fine print owns brand they're promoting like small farmer's co-op something. Oh man love this. They've officially over. know exactly handle people properly. Amazing. bucking would eat many people away. don‚Äôt kids I‚Äôm curious, people actually say anything 2 year old wearing mask? know kids start age quickly 3 4, 2 little, people actually notice? It‚Äôs like kids carry around ID.

I Europe summer noticed kids around 5-8 airport unmasked. don‚Äôt know exact age cut 2 seems tiny impossible. love toddlers, they‚Äôre still practically babies many ways. Trying keep masks seems impossible. 

I hope goes away soon. specific question, person beard wearing n95 ffp3 mask, going make mask less effective? i.e. let particles slip around mask? need go hospital non covid related things. Come dude. months ago saw videos Long COVID much except suggest lifestyle changes know people expect. health care workers know many treatments give treat symptoms root cause get anal swab tests everyone feel comfortable situation. rephrase statement. you‚Äôre boosted still cares this. supposed smell? Delta deadlier contagious idiots refused get vaccinated. Folks better get boosters. science rather clear need worry third dose. mean, point much compounded brain organ damage would surviving unvaxxed repeated infection? Could even smell point? sure seem dead set becoming permanent underclass physically financially ruining themselves. 

Actually, wonder anyone statistics yet. Financial outcomes vaxed vs unvaxed. wonder medical debt multiplies population? lost income time work due sickness? lost earning potential able go workplaces ask vaccination therefore lowered productivity due outbreaks therefore less competitive market? cash 5 year period, wonder? 

Wanna make bet pans out? apparently already bad gauging risk vs reward vs cost, bet could fleece money. Well, least visit morgue, they're already there.

Efficient. risk kids, grandparents. Keep away possible.  might change third doses (tell parents get boosters). important unvaccinated idiots well filling hospitals everyone else need access to. Unless serious health issues, get booster go enjoy life. You‚Äôre well protected. Surgery resident here. Honestly impactful reason it‚Äôs harder get surgery days significant shortage nursing staff. Nurses quitting left right due stress brought pandemic. physical ORs available, surgeon can‚Äôt case themselves. med-surg beds available, patient can‚Äôt bed without nurse cover it. Even ED backed door empty beds sit ED aren‚Äôt enough staff. remaining staff overworked compensate it, leading even people quitting. thats peak shortest wave entire world.   Bring it, I'm worried midterms Brace know wrote article one fucking bracing. vast majority people area taking far less precautions ever. 

This longer pandemic; endemic society. COVID ever. life-endangering accident next couple months, fine healthcare system gets crushed. really fault patients either want go route. get booster, take 14 days fully protected like initial doses did? recovered breakthrough case got going theme park halloween. symptoms indeed pretty mild though. I'm getting booster december. Yeah still get covid vaccinated chances fine. Still sucks can't afford take time work plans upcoming 2 weeks. say ‚Äòfully vaccinated‚Äô, booster shots? vaccine efficacy infection wears time (although dosage vaccine really reduces likelihood you‚Äôll end ICU die). you‚Äôre fully vaccinated it‚Äôs 6 months since last shot, get booster shot.   Also last year shutdown pretty much entire pandemic year everything re-opened. Movie theaters, restaurants, theme parks, music festivals, weddings, funerals, etc resumed. course you‚Äôre going deaths compared last year people still quarantine nothing nowhere go. Oh well. wanted get vaccinated been. life now. Time start acting like it. one staying home Thanksgiving Christmas year. shit last year. I'm every year we'll covid waves every winter long time. time face reality things now. literally nothing could stop covid aside locking everyone homes worldwide. Even work. stay. Get vax, get booster, live life, hope better vaccines treatments future. That's it. Well, daily life goes vaccinated people. hospitals get overrun antivaxxers, start canceling surgeries treatments, lot people going die get hurt. get car wreck, oh well. kids young get shots, oh well. mean would find something credible, would doubt study they? like allergic reactions originally, myocarditis mean can't make unlucky people blind cause long COVID without COVID

Actually precisely mean that, proven otherwise.  awful, increase. do, going overwhelm hospitals. already happened region: already ambulances waiting outside emergency centers **4 hours**: overwhelmed hospitals means people need immediate care (even COVID) cannot get it, results unnecessary deaths due delays patient care. UK testing rate 500% greater germany's. direct testing comparisons arent 1 1.  see people agree get tested rule currently it.   think many people bracing many people care anymore. Hospital workers probably biggest population actually bracing it. worried vaccinated (and maybe even boosted), never worried vaccinated definitely going start worrying now. really, no, US bracing 5th wave. New Zealand's case, NZ$1600 (about $1100) single person. 

However, lots overseas citizens residents eligible waiver, intending move NZ substantive period time.

When sister returned, pay simply visiting holiday - seems fair enough me. good. region (in NY state) already overrun COVID, 5x higher cases per 100k one year ago. hospital(s) already past capacity healthcare leaders begging: even hit Thanksgiving yet...   Police Italy currently looking possibility.

People like unfortunately pretty rare. 
Most simply lap whatever latest headline is, apply cognitive thought, go parrot read. 
Hell, sometimes can‚Äôt even correctly. 

 number months, variant circulation, vaccine / natural immunity, lockdowns, etc 2020 / 2021 aren‚Äôt great compare unless factors taken consideration least. personally seen stressed hospital workers last 2 years. Im interested making things worse, I, well family, limit potential extra patients end hospital. sure hell hope part 10% trying mitigate spread likely huge problem.  I'd imagine 95% boycott would *more* likely support actively go way buy product result unfair boycott. ""Eh, fuck it."" -schools urgency Fauci others currently telling everyone get booster implies they've looked data see catastrophe coming. work prevent serious illness, stop transmission reception delta variant. IMO it‚Äôs late. Try keep safe home rather risking grandparents.  Bike.

On serious note, since moved Germany noticed there's supermarkets, pharmacies doctors almost every 300m direction, we're fine without public transport well. Europe knows easy live without car unless live farm surrounded 500sqm fields.  We're boosters age UK, saw UK specific covid subreddit chart showing difference case rates boosted unboosted age groups. case rates younger age groups continuing upwards steadily, rates among older age groups boosters fallen cliff declining well.

Everyone gathering pretty much safe getting dangerously ill, they've two shots. looks like anyone else booster quite well protected getting infected time being, too. Hahahaha. love satire. Matt Gaetz. work, still help keep worst it. Well, long live without becoming disabled vaccine job. Sucks hear though. 90% country either unaware doesn‚Äôt care that. people life going usual. 

They either vaccine going back living normal lives, don‚Äôt vaccine still living normal lives don‚Äôt care.

Looks like New Normalers right. Life little shitty used be, suck up. Says lot vaccine even group entirely vaccinated, still afraid. Oh I've heard real reason many pregnant women held getting vaccinated. Nope. Sorry unclear.

I received J&amp;J April. caught covid August going packed nightclub. Sickest I'd ever been. got Moderna booster last month. Hopefully ever catch now.    Sickest ever got swine flu. Felt like hell solid week. that, person 25ish, ""imma start getting flu shots.""

Sucks get hit come around. I'd like think instead covid, I'd still taken seriously now. Vaxx, masks, isolation. * Good luck Germany. getting hammered here. can't lick toilet kiss grandma?

&amp;#x200B;

Perfectly fine, get order. care wording headline. could taken glance ""boosters effective"" rather real message get damn booster. It‚Äôs sad, frustrating, this. heartened making kinds considerations. That‚Äôs basically part society supposed be. Also J&amp;J +Moderna booster. saying got COVID booster? curious get buildings stay property. you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre going around vaccinated people

So vaccinated make safe around unvaccinated? Well solution seems obvious anyways, healthcare for-profit enterprise.  We're million light years away ever getting political capital make happen unfortunately, Obamacare, even close far enough right direction, much politicians handle there's probably dozens lawsuits still working way day. Covid flipped lot weird switches people.

Some people genuinely terrified human interaction point.

Some people really getting sanctimonious better everyone else still acting like it‚Äôs March 2020.

Some people still wear masks walking outside open spaces.

And people worried still getting shamed anything.

It‚Äôs kind mess right now. there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong getting shots living life 100%. Travel, go events, see family, enjoy. What‚Äôs point alive aren‚Äôt living?  Anyone else feel like life still sucks tremendously compared pre-covid isn‚Äôt getting better? Every time gets little better gets worse. may bored I‚Äôm damn bored.  Interesting. Also wondering mild case covid mild immunity worse case higher immunity. slowdown travel lot, lots resistance actually showing proof vaccination even vaccinated. Plus millions fake covid cards tell zero understanding situation Russia."" Russians working collective"" ass. cause people like you, reddit cesspool pool misinformation bad job I‚Äôd fired lol

Is job nearly difficult? haven‚Äôt got booster yet cleared everyone getting mine couple weeks. thought stupid open everyone begin with. Like whole everyone unmask vaccinated announcement backfired again. let people wanted extra protection get start with. F anti vaxxers want that‚Äôs idiots. I‚Äôve thinking fair bit. ethics get murky choices made strong negative effect many.

Doctors usually triage case case basis, prioritizing better likely outcomes.

I wonder calculus could change consider wider consequences ‚Äî eg ‚Äúwe treat pro-Covid person, they‚Äôll use ICU resources six weeks, treat accident victim, heart attack patient, stabbing victim, OD case, five people use ICU resources seven weeks‚Äù.

Nothing personal choices consequences, judgement, lives lives balance scale. Looks like read enough, maybe need help reading. literally wrong. I've taken covid **extremely seriously** someone asthma. I'm fully vaccinated booster. still wear n95 mask public. stayed mostly completely isolated wife 2020. one office wore mask desk 8 hours day last winter. even eat restaurant basically go public **at all** aside essentials vaccinated year. see friends family last year unless outdoors last summer. Like stated above, stayed home away family last Thanksgiving Christmas. literally spent Christmas Zoom exchanging presents. life return semblance normalcy spring family got vaccinated. close friends family work ICU telling first hand horror stories covid. close friends mother died vent months ago (fully vaxxed too, old health issues). I've gotten countless arguments people social media reddit people actually take covid seriously. I've literally vocal proponent following rules, listening public health officials, getting vaccinated everything personally limit impact pandemic.

Perhaps make less assumptions someone taking two minutes browse comment history. fact matter now, point, pandemic me. still think every day. Probably much. want covid. Even vaccinated know rough me. me, wife, sister elderly mother boosted. Every friend family member associate vaccinated. part past 19 months. did. There's much do. still wear n95 go store. I'm living life. far right anti-vaxxers using information push narrative ‚ÄúThE vAcCiNEs dOn‚ÄôT WoRk!‚Äù Ugh. Now, school district made cannot make kids stay home even positive. swear people actively trying make worse. Would it? think would encourage vaccination rates creating incentive.

More shutdowns hospitals overwhelmed far worse economy, agree? Medical professionals treated exactly treated patients many issues. Yeah, taken seriously. aren't. treated like crap, ignored, fobbed mental health, told need exercise, etc.. finally understanding treated patients. Maybe finally see awful might see change medical community treats us. Pretty hyped kid start high school eve 69th wave Covid. one's I've seen do.  Nice LOTR reference lol.  Anyway, I'm old enough remember called places got actual human phone right away jobs cut save money.  like over.  jobs overwork people (more 40 hours expected) there's redundancy, people given time off; there's numerous articles (even pre-pandemic) ""no vacation nation"".  That's signal we're getting Livingston County. Lol must new rumor circulating Facebook mom groups.

You're right, looking several states got two mixed up. picked one easy graphic share, here's actual link, since can't seem find it: apparently entire year

No, mine October only. lol that's infact contrary saidü§£ü§£

Well see arguments Fauci also said people full vaccinations boosters still considered fully vaccinated. confusing messaging? Schools traditionally make kids stay home disease want spreading: I've definitely come get vomiting child school several times.

Certain politicians trying deliberately spread disease make Joe Biden look bad. That's crazy are. large degree, *their* masks matter, they're kids...

Solid call get boost. TRUE stories know someone hospital covid fully vaxxed?  comment makes much sense. Needs incendiary language! people like still living lockdown, nothing could would impact pandemic, meanwhile unvaccinated people continue care. 

This weekend I'll get booster kids get second shot. I'm done. Give weeks. What, communication bees? Sounds interesting. Yeah really get point article. taking rapid antigen test immediately something (say Thanksgiving dinner), negative, **really care PCR would positive?

You're contagious either way, moment. That's ultimately goal testing.... determine could get someone else sick.

PCR tests also can't determine active inactive viral material ridiculous rely heavily. Also I'm molecular biologist, heard lot complaints 40ct way high. think antigen tests used reason. Uh say prices go up, never going down. said ""most? Maybe..."". Anything 50% most. Lucira finally instant PCR tests stock, $75 ea extremely difficult justify taking frequency. wrong alternative? Last year ran around nearly 3 months circulating unknown us took us awhile realize masks help. year southern states highest death rate younger people.

bruh europeans countries +70% population fully vaccinated yet Europe seeing new cases vaccine give body far better chance preventing contracting/spreading COVID, guarantee. never was. breakthrough cases happen, vaccine keep getting sick going ICU. That's really it, I'll take advantages day.

You still need practice good masking habits well washing hands distancing.

We trying keep gatherings small non-vaccinated people asked get negative test beforehand wear mask. far, vaxxed folks coming (whew!). We'll still taking chances, we've minimized risk much possible. Please add: Obama cultured virus Muslim family Kenya. send faux news crowd piranha frenzy. no, world coming end. must hysterical.  masks matter

Unfortunately Florida, one parents say getting kids masked up. agree wholeheartedly. vaccines make significant impact. compare death rates vaccinated population year death rates last year see ridiculous improvement. hate break virus stay. expect everyone live perpetual pandemic panic?

Thousands upon thousands people gathered ball games concerts year, family get-together's holidays going problem?. GTFO! 

Thank God people beginning see right B.S. eventually ""move"" system. mean, even vaccines boosters, feel like I‚Äôm constantly hearing person person testing positive hell breaks loose, even everyone vaccinated. Living constant nail-biting anxiety horrible. It‚Äôs never ending. Feels like nothing matters anymore, tbh. Life used much happier.  mean already started? school district averaging least dozen new positives per day past week. could go say ""Well could afford health insurance cheapskate need get paid so...""

I think really need regional respiratory centers nothing take patients leave regular hospital free. got booster week ago, days travelling Thanksgiving. Definitely would bit wary travel without booster. US 10% uptake (nationwide) 5-11 year olds? That‚Äôs like 3 million doses, assuming get 2nd shots, that‚Äôs 6 million doses.

Less, compare kids' doses adults'. ""we care"" - everyone. 

Seriously even people thought would wearing mask forever stopped. 

Seems like people want hype point MSM. misunderstanding statistics work. 99% chance *given* person survive *given* infection. person still die COVID next year, year that, year 2060.

You can't say sure someone died something dead, died something else.

COVID #3 leading cause death among people died 2020 2021. We''ll eventually get pandemic control vaccination infection.

Vaccination provides good protection limited period time (around six months) subsequent infection significantly reduced vaccination. study indicates infection provides relatively long lasting protection (at least 10 months). Repeated vaccination used prevent infection people health problems.

This will, time, create high level population resistance infection. Actually sarcasm use irony mock convey contempt. example, I'm ironically suggesting never left first wave convey contempt number people keeping numbers high enough know waves unless data right front you.  next up... coverage smokers, people drink soda pop, people drink alcohol, overweight weight people, folks take vitamins, eat broccoli. Here‚Äôs sperm.  Didn‚Äôt even know season one ended tbh   Hey, thanks ton thoughtful response! definitely messed math here, thought 100k * 360 360 million üòÖ. thought definitely add up, makes ton sense. really appreciate response. assuaged anxiety around COVID vaccine lot :)! I‚Äôve looking deaths broken month US. find weekly don‚Äôt want math tbh.

You right pre-vaccine deaths post-vaccine deaths could comparatively minuscule even Delta people got vaccinated. drank bottle Corona dose ironic reward. think headline response false information 90% vaccinated women miscarriages. fact checker site. way anyone use information excuse get vaccinated.

It's useful way 99% us medical professionals academics. ""Of 44,699 confirmatory tests reported health department Tuesday, 8,403 yielded positive results positivity rate 18.8%""

This little higher last year early December. (looking covid act . org) broke femur

That minor accident. Damn 100%. I‚Äôm Europe constant threat lockdown mentally emotionally taxing. Even lived US things ‚Äúlook normal,‚Äù life it‚Äôs worrisome we‚Äôre hearing lines, different year last year. Also, let‚Äôs real, wearing masks isn‚Äôt normal. Maybe Asian countries did, western world would great stop pretending like it‚Äôs normal.   three months ago? America, three months ago around 95% unvaccinated.

See, we're getting point boosters needed maintain immunity, - naturally logically - hospitalization rate people country, USA, going creep up. 

Show data UK.

The truth is, subset people choosing get vaccinated also likely whatever hell want public, unless government demands otherwise. participate riskier behavior.

I'm suggesting people long immunities infections - vaccinations matter. stuff highly variable based individual's immune systems severely got COVID (if got second time). 

I've got acquaintance 2-shot vaccinated Pfizer nearly died 5 months. He's outlier, obviously happen. Sarcasm saying opposite really mean. think convincing cite ethical code evidence ethical code infallible? stopped watching consequences unbelieavable side plot involving viking dude killing congress people.

I mean, seriously whole pandemic genre, put overthrow subplot follow people like wrist slaps spreading diesease trying overthrow government?

man. know that, getting ""second shot"" lady administering called booster since dosages first second shot. Hence third shot ""second booster"". People much energy spend fretting eventually become used it. 5th, 55th, whatever. Come UK! 10 cupboard. want more, order tonight come letterbox tomorrow. replace PCRs (although also get one delivered home) mean quick test think needed. should. seems medics getting calloused impatient ever, treating many critically ill unvaxxed patients. Many quitting field it. So, definitely, hold breath. Yeah, lot deal with, I'm even fuckin nurse, can't imagine shit they're going through.

Feel like safer stop caring, mental safety guess situation food contaminated.  many adults refusing, need many people vaccinated possible (i.e., kids) head fifth wave. That‚Äôs like 0.0008915 German population around 83 million. amount US 294,000 cases population 330 million. good idea. what's next? Smokers. Overeaters. People exercise. Fast food eaters. Someone going pay probably US anyway hospitals passing costs on.  Vax stop getting Covid. reduces chances symptoms drastically reduces serious developments (hospital/death). happened checkup doctor got done there. Maybe doctor's office allows walk-ins quick shots?  going people got vaccinated first. Get boosted! Got shots booster I'm this. care, fine. Michigan they‚Äôre definitely going up.  Vaccine mandate domestic air travel Thanksgiving would solve ton problems we're America screw course are? common reasons people sick winter Covid, flu, cold. noting people around protecting one them.  this. touched chain saw two years. There's small trees need cut down, wait. I've limiting contact, leave house little, always wear mask.

And got COVID last week picking damn pizza. I've vaccinated since April symptoms. Even careful, still get nailed. bro know healthcare system masks vaccine mandates design ""flatten curve"" remember is?

keeping cases capacity healthcare system overload it.

as said endemic yet still, clearly, overload healthcare system thus ""people bracing""

maybe you... get self centeredness figure whats going on. vaccinated. thought weird made sound like long-shot surviving covid. Nothing worth lost tl/dr: ""In magical world, tests would fast free available entrance every indoor store, theater, mall. can't live fantasy world? Life fair."" Anecdotally illnesses besides Covid flu. Warren Farrell wrote book ""The Myth Male Power"" (which understand plenty problematic content) calling men ""heroes"" sort ""social bribe"" used entice men act interests.

And now, ever since 2020, we've slathering ""hero"" healthcare workers. people step onto decks NYC ""applaud"" instead actually treating well, making sure needs met, paying well service provide.

The parallels stark.

We still call people ""heroes"" important work treat like garbage. meanwhile, oligarchs smiling way bank. Yet, J&amp;J never administered Canada (AFAIK). Tyrannosaurus variant upon us! 

DOOM!

Fortunately, morning woke feeling back normal right supposed go, timing worked pretty perfectly me. live outside US visiting family. got second dose Pfizer month ago. read booster 6 months after. benefit getting soon first round? working still spreading many people unvaxxed. Delta really high R value need 90% vaccinated really stop spread. almost bad measles. shouldnt worry much vaccinated/boosted immunocompromised/very old. ""ending"" slow fade depends country in. not. can‚Äôt remember one exactly sounds like need get new job get paid :(  Janssen still highly effective one shot. Still great vaccine world needs.    think problem marketing single-dose vaccine first place. 2-3 dose vaccine fine.  makes theoretical sense. immune response vaccination milder disease (obviously), greater danger comes greater reward. Oh come on. eye-rolling bullshit arrogance proven completely wrong. Oddly enough, fact waning immunity provoke lot eye-rolling Israeli ID specialists epidemiologists. provoked concern along increasing surveillance, leading recognition obvious problem, namely, original vaccination protocol two shots, always known provisional, *inadequate protect Delta.* 

Eye-rolling doctors busy rolling eyes, see front them. got many family members care want vaccinated canada , care get , 1 cousins got covid baby 2 young children wife unvaccinated probably even isolating , said paranoid want around play cards came town weeks later gets covid lol people care likely unvaccinated

And right admitted unvaccinated travel. Let know if/when compete delta. varies across board. super fatigued, full-body achey, cough, lost smell taste, haven‚Äôt able sleep basically since Sunday night (not sure that‚Äôs symptom?). One friend positive feels 100% fine. Another, pregnant, really going feels extremely ill. others less like me. still need wear mask fully vaxxed. hard wear damn piece cloth face? Yep, looking yesterday. Checked multiple stores options limited stores out-of-stock.

I ended picking couple BinaxNOW kits Walgreens cool $23.99 each. people wearing masks properly one smart enough get vaccinated. wish ska would get fifth wave. Well see numbers article kids 13 years highest incidence rates - far. they‚Äôre age group vaccinated. Seems I'm following path. time well Thanksgiving Instead unacceptable solutions, perhaps calling higher faster vaccine production year half ago. see disparity wealthy nations poor nations hurts heart. expecting people protect children failed plan start. places I've seen either stopped advertise anymore. none contagious CDC estimated 140 million people recovered COVID. relevant information almost half country. extra tinfoil hat me? Lost mine :( like... know, evolve, then. exactly point. point doctor nurse try examine patients social media personal life try determine anti-vaxer deny treatment based that. would obviously unethical.

You realize vaccination medical decision, right? 

If vaccination strictly moral ethical decision, sure, might point. 

However, not, point trying make nonsensical. 

No, publications cited reinforcing point. seem want intentionally miss point, either basic reading skills understand point is. find funny think fringe position. quite friends family medical field, common discussion right now. Getting mine speak careful, lot cases seem like there's double whammy feeling better.


HAVE DELICIOUS HORSE PASTE BORAX ENEMAS!!! /S ""a lot"" breakthroughs unless definition less 1% lot. Right. knew vaccinated people could still get it. still impression vaccinated 1. Reduces likelihood getting COVID 2. Makes less likely transmit others, get infected. 3. impression vaccinated person COVID-positive asymptomatic basically can‚Äôt transmit virus. Judging fact vaccinated, one symptoms, still basically became super-spreader event, personal doubts #2 #3. strongly believe one vaccinated people group positive asymptomatic still transmitted majority group. Happy boosted Illinois. one states rise. Many fully vaxxed here, enough boosted yet. fully expect unvaccinated crash hospitals again.  Health offices RKI indeed track case case basis.  Mortal Kombat? Luckily me, I‚Äôm spending thanksgiving anyone unvaccinated. family intelligent part federal procurement purchased AB? truth insurance companies already that. private provide funds, ACA lists preexisting conditions can't used deny care. unvaccinated one them.

He spark conversation scare people vaccinate. predict we'll see ""US Braces sixth wave covid"". could reduce ++x automate it. problem, government needs keep track communicate kind statistics. Say, 60k among unvaccinated dont care. hand 60k vaccinated start questioning vaccine. ??

I literally meant state borders 100% open. Replace word work ""live"" ""go school"" ""go park."" Replace word lunch ""grocery store"" ""a coffee."" may helpful, see seems like problem describing feelings, reality?

Maybe make list many people heard test positive, often is, check whether often perception? list consequences (all hell breaks loose)?

It may well circumstances different (not even sure country in), may also reaction problem, and, although easy, control (this discount feelings).

As much can, take care yourself, try things like; life may slightly suckier 2019, still many things enjoy life!  CEOs admin say similar thing: business...to make money. never cared begin with, would start caring now.
I wish country see Healthcare way.  Really jumped shark Wednesdays January.
Insurrection one week, impeachment next, inauguration week that? Soooo...what solution? Vans going around grabbing people street injecting them?  unvaccinated running around rampant could known things would happen. fact is, people want know. were/are denial.  Oh well, nothing unless propose forcibly restraining people injecting them. mother also showed this! 9 13 years old. good, grossed dipped cheeseburger frosty. 

memories~   also open carry without license training state long certain feet away school grounds protestors legally guns along signs protesting masks. hate here. I'm still family move away. ""Support troops!"" Otherwise, pay more. still going indoor restaurants understand, makes difference much protection receive vaccine either way. Yeah, 1/3 adult dose would 2 million doses total. 

But, almost can‚Äôt compare it‚Äôs different concentration, none vials used vaccinate children would used adults anyway. got Pfizer first two Moderna third. second Pfizer Moderna booster, first 20 hours nothing sore shoulder. got fever, body aches, fatigue, headache, lasting day. Finally, day that, pretty much back normal. trump haverapid tests every day understand it. unvaccinated folks job--a whole department them, actually. absolutely *refuse* vaccine. know it, least one confirmed COVID case. many others expose? many come symptoms? heck go get shot greatly reduces odds happening, on?

I mean, mother thinks magical mind control nanotechnology nonsense, certainly **all people** cannot actually believe tripe? one Ed Yong's better articles. description health care works exactly right. beautifully depicted many years ago movie starring William Hurt, ""The Doctor,"" surgeon gets cancer. old, obsolete, boring watch pacing, story tells exactly related article. area in? Yup, 100% expect this. Luckily got Moderna, least refused subsequent shots, got strongest one. Insurance companies already (no bill needed). ACA lists things can't deny coverage, lack vaccination one them. looks like attempt scare people vaccinate? Lack healthcare workers what's causing capacity issues. leaves massive population infect. 775k officially, probably lot count excess deaths. done early stages pandemic. Wuhan showed done. West learn. Millions volunteers could recruited lockdowns contact tracing provide community services quarantine. Instead letting people bang heads walls lockdown, could organized volunteer services strengthen community, give sense purpose beat pandemic. never understand done. paranoid nonsense. I'm fully vaccinated, encourage everyone same; ill intentions posting stuff Reddit (I tend read share stuff find interesting - like hoax-debunking stories like this, comment stuff like sports news) lol Jesus, right don‚Äôt think anyone tracks case case basis, highest numbers infections found kids (no vaccines 12 EU far) regions highest unvaccinated population.

So it‚Äôs safe say wouldn‚Äôt shit people gotten vaccinated. stats show majority vaxed. would like add, MI screwed. masks anywhere, help government, one cares anymore. plus side, kids, husband able get boosters 10 year old fully vaxed dec 3rd. used get strep throat every single year. It‚Äôs fucking brutal. think places going stick ""hold beer watch this"" strategy world legit threaten kill children (at school board meeting) get trouble??? Oh, right, that‚Äôs *our* world. Gods help us all.  Unfortunately, boosters open 65+. I've seen article, English, says that, 8 days ago - ""In Flanders, 28% people aged 65 received booster shot, putting behind Brussels Wallonia, 32% 37% age group given extra dose, according reports De Tijd. "" (FYI: three regions Belgium, three linguistic communities). So, high far..

Makes think actually sped rollout, situation... point, third dose absolutely necessary 65+. 90% directly [UK surveillance That's 2-dose delayed shots though; 3 doses better. 

Vaccination general vary vaccine: want sick pregnancy, immunities generate somewhat passed baby, hence vaccination general good idea. there's lot diseases infants risk (like measles).

There's rather little 3-dose data general, suggests covid simply concern third dose. See here. job, adjusted rules panics, got shots I'm done. job take care now. job drive 10 mph highway refuse wear motorcycle helmet. Clogged hospitals? problem region still nothing that.  Cousin's father it. Parents let get vaccinated forcing go grandparents'. Wish luck lmao asked I'm pretty sure believes virus now.

I would able resist ""I told so, fucking moron"" ""why wife pretending sick? move fake virus?"" got booster/flu combo last week trying go bullshit Covid again. think it‚Äôs politicians unwillingness protect kids, look age breakdown. Also, high number unvaccinated people especially Saxony Bavaria brings numbers there.   local community 24% positivity. big conservative community turned anti-vax. local hospital calling military. People know audacity say hospital isn‚Äôt full it‚Äôs political commentary. Ummm no. What? year virus running start previous year deaths year virus started zero, got significantly set back major lockdowns starting again? could possibly happen? /s girlfriend took 4-5 months taste returned fully. Maybe need wait longer. Well hopefully thats case onions good lol heaven forbid get it, it‚Äôs likely mild case. numbers almost doubled last week. I‚Äôm nervous holiday bump last year. And, 42% November covid deaths hospital age 60. 8% admissions fully vaccinated individuals (10% least one shot). vaccinated around vaccinated people, basically safe going get long time. Make safety decisions live maintaining years.

Barring miracle drugs, is. Well happy 2 year working holiday visa COVID hit. 

7 days exchange 2 years something much sucks.

That visa renewed. could solve denying emergency care voluntarily unvaccinated people. used find unethical frankly don‚Äôt care anymore. ration certain number beds voluntarily unvaccinated people covid, ready vaccinated covid cases (or legit medical reasons couldn‚Äôt get vaccinated), save space procedures needed. Voluntarily unvaccinated covid cases get last priority. Im assuming people care, hospitals become full unvaccinated idiots, non-covid critical patients cant seen quickly.  think dudes calling losing sight forest trees. I'm happy got care needed got quickly. However, large numbers people currently case medical resources personnel taken COVID patients.

I make guess case particular situation look news see experience exception norm. Nearly all, fatalities Covid year voluntary, amongst people made conscious decision protect vaccine.

If smallpox still around, people made similar choices‚Ä¶ well, there‚Äôs reason smallpox isn‚Äôt around anymore. People made different choices one. polio vaccine. And, part, measles, mumps, rubella. passes ere also given PDFs print - incase phone runs battery. Yep, agree 100%.  It‚Äôs fair comparison.  im 100% vaccinated. Fauci Biden said I'm good go, can't lick toilet kiss grandma? Breaking country‚Ä¶ 

Looks around‚Ä¶

Ok UK tests lot cases youth's. don‚Äôt see anybody around bracing anything got breakthrough right now, sucks. think there's lot psychology risk going here. asked play 1 million Russian roulette I'd give great reward end it, almost certainly say really freaked pulled trigger, take degree risk time daily activities. Parents necessarily going super rational framing taking small risk avoid larger risk later; lizard-brain reaction protect kid everything possibly costs. hate say it, least dead refusing vaccine. 

Yes, at-risk-and-vaccinated group still getting hurt killed, keep trying protect them. 

But large, mortality numbers seem people effectively letting die.  read ""... millions unvaccinated assholes travel holidays"" Yeah live New Jersey. gonna cold one Saturday, I'll see that. really bad local area? not, I'd worry less. Everyone fully vaccinated though huge.  no. im 100% vaccinated good go. masks Seriously. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Especially boosters. 6 months later. Glad taking time. rush. Nothing like starting new wave covid holidays even begin. going like throwing gasoline fire. lot lives lost January February wasn‚Äôt broad access vaccine. Truth always pretty wrong.  point 2020 9 months (started March)... really like 8 true pandemic months New York deaths started spiking April. Plus early (Jan/Feb) 2021 deaths spiking winter, vaccine supplies tough get fairly low % country fully vaccinated period needed vaccine fully work. Long story short, fairly misleading headline I'm sure used poorly people dislike vaccines. It‚Äôs already :( didnt experience must Fake syndrome stong one.  tiny sample size one location enough draw conclusion anything one-time individual experience. stating anyone else draw conclusion based would small minded ignorant. Covid 6x likely cause myocarditis young males vaccine

""Only"" seems like wrong term use regards 6x risk increase.  Again, patience antivaxxers stems large part surplus big mouthed quacks charlatans proper degrees. Maybe ypu guys open windows/doors/ crank heat live north. people still care this? already vaccinated can't anything more, life goes  Yeah, think sociopath/psychopath actually quite common society. may break laws murder anyone, much good society.  Yes. Waves overlap increase total amplitude. lot breakthroughs lately. vaccines still seem keeping people hospital large personally know 4 people past 2 weeks come COVID fully vaccinated. numbers show trend lately.

I fully acknowledge incidence rate myocarditis higher getting COVID vaccine. one reasons still got vaccinated young male, despite anxiety around vaccine induced myocarditis (I've struggled anxiety heart pre COVID, mind you).

My point present arguments vaccines *honestly*, acknowledge risk propery, i.e. stratify data age discussing vaccine induced myocarditis.

10.69 100,000 1 10,000, far posted (1 6000, source: still much higher overall incidence rate stratify age, much rare adverse effect demographics.

The reason replied OP inaccurately arguing vaccine help anti-vaxxers argument; stick honesy. Watching people reason accepting propaganda something else.  Well, first issue virus widespread starting beginning 2020. April big cities started getting bad really spread much US months later. 

Second was, even Republican led states, pushing mitigation strategies people cautious. course Republican base still resisted overall helped. time Biden elected, Republican led governments decided away mitigation policies even tried ban anyone using them.

This article surprise anybody. Agree completely   doing? Meaning, bad symptoms? Oh no!

Now October 8th apparently entire year, I'm completely willing believe jumped less 1% nearly third, sure seem likely imo.  Yeah, I'm gigantic baby. But.i rebound like used kid. example, never felt crappy 24 hours kid. days, I'll feel like shit 3-4 days get flu. 

Fuck that. Give needle.

Someone moderately- well-controlled diabetes really appreciable risk severe health complications near- medium-term. 

I'm really sure point think trying make here.  Strep throat like bunch glass shards cutting back throat. missing whole point. I'm saying change way decide treated someone's opinion morals. I'm saying reevaluate medical ethics status quo causing harm society. whole point ethics profession *avoid* causing harm society. 

Morals absolutely relevant, though - morality underpinning ethics. definition ""ethics"" ""moral principles govern person's behavior conducting activity."" seem think status quo moral simply somebody likely can't even identify decided time past ethical way things. got vaccinated im getting booster. nothing beyond that. state implemented indoor mask mandate throughout many counties. People bracing. Bracing booster K95. dont time get sick cant afford miss work. times triage used decide someone deserves treatment based condition, likelihood survival.

Fuck guys. didn‚Äôt know many. year vaccines made significant impact. vaccines available people didn‚Äôt take them. truth is. always chance boosters would needed.

You seem implying health officials lied boosters. cite saying boosters would \*never\* needed? heard 'not right now', lie, right? going say ‚ÄúOh F WHO‚Äù, comment judicious. free award. Good boy! People say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take chances virus‚Äù idea talking about. think maybe they‚Äôll die, maybe they‚Äôll live- entire gradient heathy dead. fall anywhere spectrum get infected. exactly right, reason ACA made insurance mandatory.

I agree. 

And that's great, glad biomarkers good everything else. lot people get taken proactive miserable years years know why, hate seeing it. really come gut. Lol Airlines actively lobbied that. want lose revenue. would honestly pay travel fully vaccinated flights! Literally zero people bracing it. one cares anymore   masks, isolation

I'm vaccinated (7 months ago, almost time booster). that's changed getting vaccinated getting vaccinated sometimes see 1-2 friends every weeks now. still wear mask public, avoid gatherings crowds, stay home sick. probably things now. Certainly may true lot people. One give battle, though. saves one life day, worth it. Pretty much, booster vaccinations important. Try explaining anti-vaxxer though wook flu

Imagine wook flu COVID along Anit vaxers limiting rest us   tired experience. don‚Äôt f around anymore flu Also maybe old folks remembering many funerals friends went January year. won't, northeast operate fine theyre used cross state travel bracing sense I'm going daughter wear mask more. Brace fact engage family antivaxxers especially winter etc. be. They're suggesting people denied vaccinated. That's different condition denied.

We already something similar transplants..  raging alcoholic refuses stop drinking get booted lists. got sort bug (negative Covid- tested rapid 2x PCR 1x course week half) outdoor music festival ten days ago.

I don‚Äôt know sort wook flu got knocked ASS. extremely careful throughout pandemic, work home, don‚Äôt ever dine indoors, etc. think immune system shocked. positive side, truly shows well vaccines work even waning immunity.

I‚Äôm double vaxxed getting booster flu soon this. freaking cold made miserable don‚Äôt even want think Covid. I‚Äôm Florida already feel shitstorm brewing here. see much reason fret vaccinated/boosted. virus going go away, protected face low risk. Despite hype breakthrough cases waning immunity, end day minority unvaccinated adults making outsized impact course virus.  haven‚Äôt left home two years. Finally going town. booster double masking. may ""current medical ethics"" according you,

And according people decide medical system runs. deny treatment people based find deserving not. think people could've easily prevented need treatment priority people took preventative measures simply unlucky.

We call appeal emotion. I'm saying anti-vaxers deserving someone else. I'm saying ethically speaking deny treatment people based think deserving. moral need change.

Who decides moral? According religions immoral sex wedlock. immoral gay. person like opposite side political spectrum conservative state making argument are. Instead saying ""they vaccinated"" saying ""well pregnant woman gay man STD could easily prevented need treatment according morals, I'm going treat them"". 

Again, understandable frustrated upset anti vaxers, reason ethics procedures want let frustrated upset people make policy. angry, vent internet, pretend like thought process merit would taken seriously anybody credibility. husband braced getting boosters. He‚Äôs 2 weeks that‚Äôs perfect timing since immunity built goes back work unvaxxed dummmies crammed many unvaxxed dummies around Thanksgiving table could. casualty latest wave. I‚Äôm public school teacher kids aren‚Äôt vaccinated don‚Äôt wear masks properly. got positive test result Monday spent yesterday sweating day bed. Luckily vaccinated feel like I‚Äôm upswing now. wave need happen. good hear. family fully vax, still concern break thru elderly parents. county state run leverage. get bit raise 2 years ago happened!
And last year Covid money Covid related leave. take sick vacation time need Covid related situations. Thankfully accumulate average sick vacation time. much spike necessary define wave? Genuinely asking I've heard many people defining differently. I'm 3x vaccinated I'll take precautions always.  They'll tell thing. Many factions sides entirely secular, see purely ethnic conflict. agree he's totally dropped ball since dropped restrictions Memorial Day weekend. basically chalks covid response success notch belt, he's done essentially, even though mandate long overdue. state DOH never even contacted tested positive, breakthrough cases almost certainly drastically under-reported whole. would require electronic federal registry effective. We're many steps away that. break country? could make air travel anything buy ticket Seriously, ever going get pandemic? people world vaccinated yet many countries struggling highest number infections hospital cases far. seems like never going end. last surge never really ended, least doctor friend tells it. They're exhausted overworked. occurring inopportune time. shows childish people are. fifth sixth seventh wave; serious illness still staring face. Murphy pretty bad opinion, Would kill young blood run office. Still better Jack. would also love mandate indoor dining Yeah, I‚Äôve already contact family, took home rapid test sinus congestion sniffles came back negative observation symptomatic came back negative it‚Äôs probably cold.  see, well fortunately vaccines don‚Äôt appear cause cytokine storms, makes sense presented antigens cleared body within hours, vs infection would take much longer, could trigger reaction. Yeah, makes whole thing crazier. symptoms, asymptomatic.

I say this, none required hospitalization best knowledge they're okay still.

Some guys wwii vets pretty terms age. went get booster saw company mid 20s-early 40s people. So, bracing. 

But think everyone this. unvaxed start, vaxed tired this. vaxed aren‚Äôt taking precautions, like boosters, tests larger gatherings, masks public‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm done giving holidays seeing family friends. elevensies? lot places hitting 70% vaccinated 94% vulnerable population vaccinated. get vaccine mandates. Also get vaccine denied care certain situations. Time tell antivaxers dumb one carws thier opinion . wife go back office cause executive cannot comprehend WFH. mean time I‚Äôm working job home taking care toddler, cause don‚Äôt want send day care. know bad situation all, would like people care more. Cause would, would last year, kid would daycare, minimum wife wouldn‚Äôt waste 2 hours driving everyday. China buying every mask could find depleting world's supply.  New York can't change federal law aka ACA prohibits denying coverage precondition  Definitely it. Exactly - Covid money gone. still Independent Living youth gone soon well.
And far worse year last. Rewind first 6 months Covid. told spend little time Covid patients room avoid exposure. Except cleaning services don‚Äôt go Covid rooms, nurses clean. Phlebotomy doesn‚Äôt go in, nurses draw labs. Fuck even respiratory wouldn‚Äôt go sometimes, treatments. Post post online patients coding staff wouldn‚Äôt go in. Doctors writing orders windows tell nurses do, nurses physically run code skeleton crew. got thrown entire line buses kicked cliff. 

Most us won‚Äôt inpatient nursing unless pay significantly more. didn‚Äôt sign shit, I‚Äôm martyr. It‚Äôs job‚Ä¶ pay bills. LEGAL ways better lives dont get it.  Tell give pay. x hours life work. like execs, shrewd demand pay demand work. feel that. live near NYC, smart vaccine mandate. I'm across river NJ, mandate. weird travel couple miles peace mind indoor activities, something entire states/regions (preferably whole country) adopt, individual cities. Yeah, healthcare workers concerned regular flu season top Covid - last year flu abnormally low due lockdowns, year likely closer normal. makes sense public health messaging people might intentionally catch covid avoid vaccination, falsely believe infected.

From purely scientific perspective, peer-reviewed article shows similarly protective. Surprisingly, something CDC agrees systematic review meta-analysis including data three vaccine efficacy trials four observational studies US, Israel, United Kingdom, found significant difference overall level protection provided infection compared protection provided Ibuprofen harmless.  think commenter would agree you. took knocking dumbasses think Vaccine 100% effective. Dude fucking suck. hop right fucking high horse make assumptions people act like never even seen horse called dumb shit.  imagine parents telling kids can't chapman's? 

""No chapman's tonight kids, covid policies place like, even though work there.""


That's like boycotting chikfila athiest. 

""Sorry kids, there's much Jesus place."" Yeah like August? highly dependent live US. LA, definitely reinstated restrictions one strictest vaccine mandates country.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Tell truth is. always chance boosters would needed. lot vaccines 3-4 dose vaccines.

If really cared Africa would making aggressive deals JnJ get single dose vaccine population median age 19. forcing countries huge number 80 year olds deny boosters elderly.

Also cannot stress unlikely need vaccines every 6 months. another myth like ""**eternal mutating killer variant coming soon theatre near you**"". likely initial 3-4 doses yearly vaccine become like flu shot take based risk tolerance. hospital still surgery. expect sit recovery room like 10 hours uncomfortable stretcher nothing eat crackers apple juice.  Ha got quesadilla taco bell mine last night. Hope u enjoyed ur well earned wendys. :) got booster WV, asked pharmacist gave shot numbers compared earlier year. said earlier year many people coming appointments booked; trickle mostly unbooked. 

My papaps got covid October; fully vacinated back February. Spent 2 weeks extremely ill. Took month fully recover. People seem aware maybe care declining efficacy vaccine, requiring booster. Likely difference life death. Yeah understand that. full, safe facing cancers/diseases lowered immune systems, covid-adjacent deaths/injuries considered this. Unfortunately US public general shows short term memory is. two shot regime. 

Also, CureVac 'drop' (chases activities) vaccine candidate (for various reasons, mainly *""overall vaccine efficacy symptomatic COVID-19 48¬∑2% ""*). plan 'redesigned' version ot vaccine candidate.  


I copy summarize today ([in another CureVac (Germany) mRNA first vaccine candidate. 
 
Key points ('highlights' selected myself): 
 
Method: 
 
HERALD randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 clinical trial conducted 47 centres ten countries Europe Latin America. use interactive web response system stratification country age group (18‚Äì60 years ‚â•61 years), adults history virologically confirmed COVID-19 randomly assigned (1:1) receive intramuscularly either two 0¬∑6 mL doses CVnCoV containing 12 Œºg mRNA two 0¬∑6 mL doses 0¬∑9% NaCl (placebo) days 1 29. 
 
Findings: 
 
Between Dec 11, 2020, April 12, 2021, 39‚Äâ680 participants enrolled randomly assigned receive either CVnCoV (n=19‚Äâ846) placebo (n=19‚Äâ834), 19‚Äâ783 received least one dose CVnCoV 19‚Äâ746 received least one dose placebo. 
 
After mean observation period 48¬∑2 days (SE 0¬∑2), 83 cases COVID-19 occurred CVnCoV group (n=12‚Äâ851) 1735¬∑29 person-years 145 cases occurred placebo group (n=12‚Äâ211) 1569¬∑87 person-years, **resulting overall vaccine efficacy symptomatic COVID-19 48¬∑2%** (95¬∑826% CI 31¬∑0‚Äì61¬∑4; p=0¬∑016). 
 
**Vaccine efficacy moderate-to-severe COVID-19 70¬∑7%** (95% CI 42¬∑5‚Äì86¬∑1; CVnCoV 12 cases 1735¬∑29 person-years, placebo 37 cases 1569¬∑87 person-years). 
 
In participants aged **18‚Äì60 years, vaccine efficacy symptomatic disease 52¬∑5%** (95% CI 36¬∑2‚Äì64¬∑8; CVnCoV 71 cases 1591¬∑47 person-years, placebo, 136 cases 1449¬∑23 person-years). 
 
**Too cases occurred participants aged 61 years older (CVnCoV 12, placebo nine) allow meaningful assessment vaccine efficacy.** 
 
Solicited adverse events, mostly systemic, common CVnCoV recipients (1933 \[96¬∑5%\] 2003) placebo recipients (1344 \[67¬∑9%\] 1978), 542 (27¬∑1%) CVnCoV recipients 61 (3¬∑1%) placebo recipients reporting grade 3 solicited adverse events. 
 
Interpretation: 
 
CVnCoV efficacious prevention COVID-19 severity acceptable safety profile. **Taking account changing environment, including emergence SARS-CoV-2 variants, timelines development, decision made cease activities CVnCoV candidate focus efforts development next-generation vaccine candidates.** 
 
 
 
Note: i'm OP. 
 
May relevant add-on information CureVac CVnCoV CV2CoV (from CureVac official press releases): 
 
""CureVac Shift Focus COVID-19 Vaccine Development Second-Generation mRNA Technology"" (October 12, 2021) 
 
""announced **strategic decision focus COVID-19 vaccine development towards development second-generation mRNA vaccine candidates collaboration GSK withdraw first-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidate**, CVnCoV, current approval process European Medicines Agency (EMA)""

Nurses major group brutal workload, get attention, it‚Äôs nursing assistants, phlebotomists/lab workers, techs, secretaries, cleaning ladies ‚Äî pretty much supporting staff (and physicians too). run us skeleton respective departments. 

Like, last hospital one phlebotomist ENTIRE HOSPITAL. fuck going one person hired draw everyone‚Äôs blood whole hospital??! go Quest Labcorps multiple phlebotomists drawing blood small building‚Äî hospital mgmt **one** sickest people hospital? ask labs tests taking long get back? Well shit, there‚Äôs one person drawing blood. 

Same cleaning ladies. Complaints rooms clean trash overflowing - there‚Äôs 2 cleaning ladies! It‚Äôs skeleton crew bullshit. Mgmt acts like there‚Äôs one hire truth trying lower overhead increase profits wear everybody working. 

I could go days. public really needs aware this.  Right. also said back May ""weren't yet"" cited lagging vaccination rates reason mandate. feel like mandate would encourage people get vaccinated, well keeping vaccinated among us safe. time said we'd everything tandem NYC, I'm quite sure he's waiting for. make much sense let situation get worse instead putting something place would prevent that. also app called Docket even QR codes now, sure official vaccine passport app literally rules saying show anywhere all. get AstraZeneca booster? 
Got J&amp;J jab 6 months ago currently country offers AstraZeneca vaccines. go booster? got information mixing 2 vaccines. fair, people are. people care medical field ones got vaxed. anti vax I‚Äôve worked don‚Äôt wear masks, it‚Äôs big deal spread conspiracy theories. recently outbreak fire station, biggest anti vax FF, got COVID hospitalized. ‚ÄúMan shit killing me‚Äù said. 

Well shit Sherlock. Maybe now, he‚Äôll take seriously comes back months breath again. Please reread comment focus many cases instances enough data known doctors disagree

Now addressing think doctors lose license recommending something dangerous. Ivermectin dangerous wrong amount. 

This perfect example trying say. know Ivermectin approved humans fight parasites. know peer reviews data shown effective testing covid. Hell, know, could dangerous people covid. simply data support one way another. rather saying ivermectin dangerous helpful covid patients, goal comment prevent doctors making claims without ample peer reviewed data support claims. 

We simply don‚Äôt know ivermectin impacts covid patient, time shouldn‚Äôt recommend it. study find out. doctor currently recommending based scientific analysis. Covid become highly politicized subject conspiracy theories drastic misunderstanding science disease. can‚Äôt afford let doctors publicly make unsubstantiated claims based political ideology compound confusion even further. Doctors err side caution simply say, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt enough meaningful evidence Ivermectin effective. don‚Äôt take better understanding.‚Äù

On hand, hundreds millions people vaccines without serious side effects death. plethora double blind, randomized, peer reviewed research showing effectiveness vaccines reduce transmission seriousness symptoms covid. doctors recommending vaccines based plethora evidence. that, doctors pay attention seek constantly changing body evidence studies conducted various aspects covid, mutations, vaccine effectiveness, boosters, etc. sure lot stuff don‚Äôt know yet might ever learn, certainly enough doctors point people right direction without making unsubstantiated claims. Colorado six months mandate. go People realize close came total collapse. lost patients treatable diseases every hospital full brim. say anything overmanned/overpaid/underworked, suppose Longshoremen could fit category?

My point though every industry company penny pinching assholes stretch workforce like butter scraped much bread. imagine half country vaccinated. work social services. critical point terms staffing. 5 people cannot even get people hiring list! insane. doubled job responsibilities month end sight. Moderna first two got boosted weeks ago (Pfizer). Side effects weren‚Äôt nearly bad 2nd Moderna dose. 

I‚Äôm young healthy, pretty much no-brainer me‚Äîsignificantly reduce risk ever getting Covid virtually eliminate chance severe Covid. 

And initial data Israel seems suggest [boosters last much longer initial 

This week found neighbor hanging breakthrough case Covid, didn‚Äôt even bother much, since know I‚Äôm protected possibly be, appears booster reduces chances symptomatic infection ~95%. (FWIW I‚Äôm basically possible incubation period don‚Äôt Covid). I'm trying take easier folks whose kids qualified hesitant, I'm seeing greater numbers, want turn off. parents antivaxx zealots, yeah, never going get kid vaccinated. I'm seeing quite vaccinated parents hesitating younger kids, try give info without judgmental. LA what's field people overmanned, overpaid, underworked? people bracing teachers, doctors, nurses, people forced deal people bracing. hate people. depths soul hate them. transferred guy day 40yo. medical hx diabetes. Otherwise healthy. 

He got covid, ICU, hx emergency surgery remove PE, coded table. got back, renal failure, trach placed finally got removed. gallbladder appendix removed hospital. He‚Äôs got permanent clotting disorder now. CHF, A-fib, liver damage, permanent lung scarring. body got wrecked. 

If you‚Äôre medical field you‚Äôre vaxed, suck it‚Äôs choice. time it‚Äôs responsibility make sure wear appropriate PPE FUCKING TIME. Wear damned mask stop worrying kid, parents grandparents. long last I'm curious about. specific.  Covid patients abusing staff screaming - well - die result choices. People deny covid demand ivermectin put ventilator. vocal fools. take exception ""fifth wave"". first wave, always first wave. seen much burnout Nurses. seen crying. Unfortunately understaffing overworking care provided goes dramatically short term profits go up. Things need change.  know. CDC website calls specifically - Things know: long vaccine protection lasts.

I stress it. it'll give piece mine get boosted. not, change guidance. :( Half isn‚Äôt fair. vax rate significantly higher that. I'm seeing lot vaccinated friends skipping thanksgiving again. Here's thing, I've done part. I'm boosted, family boosted, everyone associate least vaccinated. I'm going see family Thanksgiving. I've stopped wearing mask outdoor public indoor uncrowded spaces. I'm sorry, Jesus Christ, know things ""normal"" yet (hell, days probably good), least go live life little bit. boosted along people with, chances catching breakthrough infection incredibly slim. Go see family friends. We're ones blame shit. We've done part. FWIW, France require booster vaccine 2 months J&amp;J want keep vaccine passport. Selfishly, I'm happy im PT. Cause stress free life That's fever present.  Seriously imbecile  fair late August last year releasing papers stating masks completely ineffective stopping Covid. entire pandemic national international shitshow. American way. Bottom line first D: Google shootouts routinely overwhelm ERs across country time, maybe discuss best way triage care.

Events overwhelm hospitals happen frequently enough clear guidelines divert incoming ambulances. already thought it, point reputable person ever said ""lets decide deserve treatment"". dislike point much want way works, medical ethics something we're figuring fly. original post though seemed indicate didn‚Äôt matter vaccinated comes spreading virus, absolutely does. seriously need sort triage based vaccination status. recommended get vaccine didn‚Äôt get it, stay home bed opens (and elective surgeries never get canceled make room you).

This would blow practice. But, man, I‚Äôm tired worrying get care local hospital. source share...cool cool cool Um, anti-vaccination MD seems sufficiently dangerous me. think Murph taking wait see approach regard. trending upwards steadily month case counts, think he's gonna pull trigger indoor vaccine/ mask mandates cases start surging significantly hospitals start feeling overwhelmed. And? I‚Äôm one internet giving bad advice covid. 

You live get state people following guidelines. everyone lucky tell people live life based origins comments experiences fucking stupid. I‚Äôm vaxxed boosted may sound silly I‚Äôm bracing dialing back sports.

In middle last year‚Äôs peak broke femur kiteboarding big storm. took ER seen right away thankfully. could FEEL anxiety stress doctors staff treated me. felt incredibly guilty taking precious time resources thought Kai Lenny people literally dying ICU me. 

I‚Äôm still going live life dirt biking season, gonna go 70% ability snowboarding kiteboarding usually love pushing limits.

I don‚Äôt want burden don‚Äôt want hurt receive adequate treatment.

Small sacrifice probably think stupid/useless make sense me.   think there‚Äôs middle ground. vaxxed boosted. Support vaccine mandates work, also done expending emotional labor caring people aren‚Äôt protecting themselves. 

At time I‚Äôm halting life anymore things wanna like use gym without mask, hang vaccinated friends, etc. I'm pretty sure ivermectin ""thing"" sixteen months ago.

Liar. Peer-reviewed article Lancet, top medical immunity vaccination certainly much safer preferred.** Given evidence immunity previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, policy makers consider recovery previous SARS-CoV-2 infection equal immunity vaccination purposes related entry public events, businesses, workplace, travel requirements.

I.e. vaccine safe effective. caught COVID get vaccinated, also protected. good news provides scientific argument COVID becoming endemic winter wave. "
