0,2020-11-15," vaccine covid basically modern day gold rush companies, feel, incentivized profits rushing testing phase get product everyone else.

Conversely, company put bad vaccine would never make single cent again. plenty incentive cautious.

Plus, multiple vaccines. first nice PR, company puts safe vaccine rolling money.  Yes. It'd significantly expensive build network ulta-cooling-refrigerators Pfizer vaccine (which going happen anyways) buy slighlty expensive Moderna vaccine. Yeah, could interpreted pretty weird kind whataboutism... Yeah fucking leeches never worked day lives need fo maskless COVID ward awhile. Maybe theyll spend save lives. I'm suggesting China still come clean lol I’m tired shit grandpa! Less $50 Thank you. one many examples proving point. RN, working community. see every day matter many times tell clients wear mask, 99% don’t. love everything ""america"" call it. 7 billion people planet $50 monthly wage lot countries. Apparently 94.5% efficacy rate 94.5% effective like almost every major headline suggesting. someone ELI5 difference? obvious? hospital last place want right now, hard child get necessary social interaction everybody avoiding other. going free US proven. proven cells upper esophagus ACE2 receptors, preferred pathway virus cell. I'm convinced there's lot without buy governors. point lot things Trump wrong can't point much Biden turn around , least quickly. spreads like covid. disagree, politicians first see side-effect dangerous  Fauci actually said could back normal next summer go well. We're certain eradicated yet not. However, recent data Madonna quite promising significantly reduce disease severity.

If SARS-COV2 reduced common cold life goes normal. Pfizers can’t stored dry ice? [We never ever ever getting mean way Bush war terrorism soldiers airports tanks streets? KN95 worked well n95, they’d reserved medical professionals Considering guy brings Ebola pandemic Congo makes feel like one biggest issues waaaaay ""hardned"" point. Like ""Ive dealt Ebola disease much less severe get sick"".

Which....it makes feel maybe keep trying stop extremly severe diseases poor countries let someone else deal severe much easily spread disease rich country. No, emergency provisions place grant administration powers temporarily. needs parliament approval, get. one military US (made disparate segments sharing umbrella command structure). control top somewhat uniform. Contracts equipment services generally tendered end using them. example pilot can't ask plane serviced anyone contracted so. army colonel get choose model tank he'd like equip soldiers with. decisions made higher ups. absolute course soldier buy boots long meet spec expressly prohibited go.

It's much states vs federal government military, individual state could well provide public healthcare would fit bill ""socialised healthcare"". individual private entity allowed raise military force, bezos can't buy fleet tanks fighter jets.

Even free healthcare (no cost patient accessed) wide variation service. UK there's phenomenon known postcode lottery, available services may differ based live (you still welcome private insurance avail whatever provide). 

I'm probably explaining well, mobile busy. 

Let's compare buying new phone defending foreign aggressor. free buy whichever phone want pay much want. hostile plane incoming bomb house (it's stretch know hear out) can't pay someone stop plane shoot down. call US military there's private military.  ….how think clinical trials work?  I’m physician understand would walk( even did, don’t buy it). worked hospital 14 years..they kinds messed up! real leadership. People business degrees making decisions affect “doctoring”. Doctors much staff anyone else working isn’t administration. happen ones write scripts ACTUALLY save life drugs. medical personnel save lives( don’t want people think don’t think highly definitely do!). think general public coming false pretenses doctor whatever he/she needs save life. can’t. rules, laws govern choices make. Patients get pigeon holed, patients get neglected organization medical staff. one doctor enough treat 50 covid patients?? That’s fair doctor. It’s like Walmart two clerks shoppers demanding increase speed checkout lines, reduce waiting times! Cant it, don’t enough clerks shoppers. docs make good pay doesn’t mean don’t suffer! Stress, illness, personal sacrifices used abused! vaccines cause mild fever. immune system reacting it. Hence babies given Calpol etc first rounds immunizations. eBay would buy n95s. Two weeks ago wait ER waiting room one state's busiest hospitals several hours mom got bad accident.

There guards posted door make sure everyone goes temperature scanner comes wearing mask. one coming building, even security guards wearing masks half mast/ chins. Maybe lock people down, I'm sure could issue order wear masks somehow, least local city level similar? Like article says, restrictions law (Public Order Act) longer People violate ban organising larger events could face **fines even imprisonment six months**. One greatest injustices working world arrangement shittiest, miserable, grueling jobs also ones pay least.

I'd problem making minimum wage employers understood ""minimum wage"" means ""minimum work effort."" no, America. brother dying cancer picked pain meds yesterday 200. insurance won’t pay pain meds. 
  I’m hurting financially anyway 200. pain meds crazy. ambulance hospital 20 minutes away cost 800. Taxi cost 22.00 
800. ambulance ! He’s going via taxi announcement, Sputnik V officially **96%** effective. Well that's thing, think know everything others opinions beliefs. That's I'm trying ask questions talk see person believes assume know. I've wrong many times assuming someone thinks do. 

From way replied, seems think could handle listening people, would think I'm mature 99% reddit. makes kinda sad think must seen many times one attempting listen disagree people argue. kinda see would feel hopeless people listening understanding reddit world general. makes sense would doubt possible. 28 guys. Let set vaccine work someone who’s already covid 19 mean, 1918. than, that, though . . . 4th vaccine Russian Sputnik. cultural battles. lose liberals issue could lose liberals taxes rally troops fight liberals people never see liberal policy Bought 20 grainger 10 vents, 10 without 55 bucks 42% trial population older, high risk individuals. Well yeah (at least 99%) put article lot actors like “yeah awful, couldn’t leave house paint 4 days watched movies 5 different televisions sore throat, make sure u take seriously” meanwhile there’s immunocompromised people stuck hospital live small home literally pick paint wall 2 weeks problem they're used consequential settings whether tell college student isolate two weeks.

this disconnect is.

rapid tests preventative.. diagnostic

&amp;#x200B;

do let ANYTHING school office.. ANYTHING.

flu, cold, covid

&amp;#x200B;

test everyone every day (or every 2 days).

you test positive? 

***SO FALSE POSITIVE?***

that person goes home PCR TEST NEGATIVE.

so 2-3 days office/class.

this **much better** everyone 2 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

you ***might*** sick ***something***

go home stay **PROVE** not.

whatever may may relevant. 

do bring school. biggest challenge convincing public take vaccine. Logistically, distributing major issue.

I've already received emails CVS stating selected administer Covid19 vaccines. 10 years ago notice influx Physician’s Assistants(PA’s). Flooding departments hospital worked at. Healthcare Corporations trying replace physicians lower paid, lesser educated group. go doctor PA comes in, always ask see doctor. patient billed see PA see doctor. difference doctor went med school 4 years 4 years undergrad, 4-7 year residency. PA goes school 2 years. coming 1 year virus next month. year done saying. another year MIGHT functionally ended pandemic. would 2 years. don’t know think many people US take it. plan it, that’s clear. asking real question problem people misinformed, choosing read wanted believe first place.

The vast majority people (logically) wildly uneducated vaccines viruses. mentally latched onto (easier handle interpretation) ""vaccine = shit's celebrate"". hospital almost certainly buy PPE eBay. yeah I'd say 3/4 love partner. rest old school teachers refuse change. ask anything they're always it. Like contacting students families they're etc. odd. Spouse put insane hours every day. think knowing content good teaching go long way. many admins good teachers begin with. they're analysis teaching like flawed. know classroom management dealing socio economic issues. Plus lots old teacher new ideas like restorative justice either. Good luck finding real deal KN95 states  wonder taken lyophilized, would make far easier transport extremely long shelf life. 14% patients experienced “touch tism” per Pfizer. still got Oxford pipeline Drew/Bob, would like bid $2001. Yup, time vaccine come out. People fucking stupid.  work vaccines watching company industry snap action built inspiring. Lots research teams small biologics companies quietly preparing this. Building technologies production capacity decades long project, seeing looks like mobilize it. Good point. Huh? confusing someone. Los Angeles  Yeah thought seen Professors giving another percentage much placebo hence giving split numbers. guess comes form paper reviewing. press conference text indeed. are. like football team loses super bowl. sulk little happy try things. census specific goal hit every single American, goes great lengths expense achieve goal. Vaccination doesn’t require 100% participation, even significant percentage getting vaccinated would dramatically boost chances achieving herd immunity - good kind herd immunity, millions people don’t get sick die. fair, back march beginning pandemic european countries recommend masks, order prioritize supplies medical staff.   
But yeah, Sweden - least one certain swedish guy; insisted recommending maskins today. bad we’re smart country. would universal healthcare. people actually put guard now... Unfortunately, half America already infected SARS-COV2. So, much hate talk herd immunity infection route, likely play major factor slowing pandemic half population already type immunity.

Also, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca/Oxford Novavax likely pumping vaccines new year. thought said US?  DNS root servers. yes, world community complains US DNS control *frequently*. funny Oxford vaccine also two big neurological adverse events

Is oxford vaccine based previous MERS vaccine development? thats case sense one longest development time behind it? Drowning deep sea COVID

Socially distancing here

Will give me? recommendation everyone stay home socialize outside people live since weeks ago. problem compliance much worse time around spring. healthy adult, unlikely get vaccine next 5 months. Next job big Pharma. Find drug turns deplorables liberals.
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 may meant fat contributed obesity mortality factor worded wrong? trump geniuses also believed rose garden event. They’re not. Exactly. GOP worried money, shouldn’t included giant billionaire tax breaks first stimulus. people bottom get money spend it. people top get money hoard it. would actually support failing economy pandemic? Gee, wonder... start voting wisely. means R. Queued video later. Pfizer Moderna mRNA-based right? OH WAH-AH-AH-AH! Thus ""supposedly"". compare periods active infection baseline excessive deaths clear.

Likewise excess death curve returned, November December make clear folly.

And look US see excess death Sweden: Florida.

Did partial lockdown weeks, didn’t like full opened. overloaded hospitals, crushed economy, still getting massive second wave building.

Denial nothing fix problem.

Wear mask, CoVID19 real, job save own.

Unless dig ditches rent refer trucks. Friend, completely misread message. downvotes correct answer, naturally really see point lockdowns mask mandates result excess deaths 2020? Wait till hear Oxford vaccine. Oh humanity! many wrong America???? middle health crisis, doctors fired hospitals understaffed?? Mind boggling!! Belgium struggles hiring much people possible, even retired doctors welcomed back want help out! Sure will. government also said ""we're rounding curve"" ""It'll gone Easter"". US government Americans whole can't anything right. need 199,999,999 shots fucking way get vaccine I'll also say people enrolled trials generally higher risk catching virus - healthcare essential workers places hit hard virus. kinds situations, careful take far. preliminary results ongoing study. approval need to:

1. Wait 151 people get infected complete trial.

2. Turn data third parties (including scientists regulatory agencies) analyze fine detail. ...do think countries need archaeologists? bragging zero cases? go back bragging go away? exactly point boasting/bragging indefinite solution? stupid see official death numbers show excess deaths? that's case, Jeff Bezos one making much money??? Stephen Hoge? seeing happens make political issue natural phenomenon. virus care believe. IMO nobody declared 'done great' outbreaks finished. then, ""they severe outbreak *yet*"" every place hasn't. wish family well bro. sister elementary teacher child healthcare worker class catch mom. Kid super sick missed 3 weeks school. It’s definitely always harmless kids.

Worse mom sent boy school already tested positive test pending. expect much people guess. China?  Whoa whoa whoa people normally get THREE HOURS CPR? First all, statistical models account bit variation infection rates. words, going perform interim analysis 90 cases, mean ineffective vaccine *has to* produce 45-45 split. 46-44 they'd still conclude vaccine ineffective, variations expected. example, Pfizer said they'd first interim analysis 32 cases take conclusive readout efficacy *only if* got fewer 6 cases vaccine arm. 

Most importantly, however, trials double blinded. People know got vaccine got placebo. Moreover, participants instructed counselled enrollment trials, part involves instructing carry lives normally without changes behaviour. guy getting many death threats lawsuits thrown already. It’s horrible. Maybe? I’ve read fair bit military handling logistics, really curious meshes people needing hired, I’m sure needed *doubt

They'll mess up. America can't anything right.  Sweden become apparent deniers like you.

So numbers show right now, **will** become apparent, somehow Sweden ""did awefully"" XD

We wait see excess deaths, 2 weeks.

It's middle November, see excess deaths 2020 yet, 2 weeks. white house small island middle nowhere strict quarantine protocols addition, randomized actual vaccines purposely given cautious demographic. said ""new normal"" would permanent. said would apply effective vaccine came along. gonna wait year see others react. 

The first people Moderna trial received vaccine mid March 2020, alive healthy. doubt able get much March 2021. going work perfectly you. tens thousands volunteers took small risk people think like do. point? Less 1% swedes disease, anything effective restrictions enhanced hygiene bring annual deaths, Covid-19 not.

The point restrictions sudden rise cases overwhelm limited capacity treat people. need thing common influenza, rate spread far less aggressive. far sweden overwhelmed, although current trend sure look good already tightening approach.

And yes, let roam free fail containment, people die lack covid-19 causes without access treatment. Damn whole $8 guess I'll die. That’s head scratching, I’m seeing people partying social media India it’s probably going young people may know carrying could see spike did. even bookmarked it. God forbid Twitter saves sodding bookmarks. Yea got now. know much studies conducted 😅 Dealing normal logistics instead deep cryologistics. Thank god! participants assigned randomly know whether got vaccine placebo. Neither nurses inject vaccine, anybody else except small group people.They look data certain pre-established number cases (95 study) reached.

So, can't totally sure it, assume thousands people group behave similarly average. Awesome! Reasonable people take it, idiots rebel it, disease take course maybe we’ll left better world after. Fine *they* need doctor.  talking lots mitigation nothing endgame is. Flatten curve delaying question what. Uh, taxes pay government. It’s money either way. Yep, vaccine sounds much easier distribute terms logistics ... big relief! one also produced US, added manufacturing jobs, well Go look trades. Look exited pfizer one week ago today. Look exited modena literal day phase 1 announcement.

Again, want believe vaccines real. doesn’t matter many people vaccinated matters many people getting infected daily.

Social distancing ends community spread reaches low levels.   UK (or US, EU, etc), big deal poorer countries.

You consider logistics costs too. (which big deal stored standard freezer 6 months, needing -80C cold storage like BioNTech's) got worse April US earlier year. Perhaps get worse next 5 months. Oxford/AstraZeneca 69th vaccine: 9000%! So, basically never. couple stores went past couple days cleared toilet paper towels. Yes failure. shut economy din't get excess deaths compared last 10 years.

Lockdown, wear masks! Look, it’s another idiot doesn’t understand magnitude response.

Dumbass, economy goes shit pandemic matter shutdown not.

The Federal Reserve said getting CoVID19 control way forward.

The doctors need working 70-80 hour weeks, surgeons sidelined due inability elective procedures due full ICU’s, that’s result failure combat virus.

And no, surgeon isn’t hospitalist, coder ICU nurse, healthcare highly specialized.

Absolutely wear masks, proven work worn effectively proper materials selected.

Stop idiot, isn’t hard. I'll believe see r/mapswithoutnz never heard Got it. looks like someone desperate attention Thank info. hard grasp reality live tiny island Also knew got placebo would careful thought already mass producing vaccines even without knowing work not. vaccines requiring 2 shots 2 shots done simultaneously? wait abit getting 2nd shot? That's said exposing willingly possible 😅 number ""covid deaths"" high (10 times higher Denmark), increase total deaths? placebo control blinded 10s thousands subjects, bias behavior randomness described eliminated design. muh testicles Yep is, best professional advice got dad summer started university, fully intended going pre-med med school route, plan whole life point, couple years job moved one massive healthcare groups. sat said “I won’t tell go medicine, need 110% sure it’s want do, need sure couldn’t even imagine something different, idea future medicine look like 10-15 years, doesn’t look good.” changed major week. know sure wouldn’t able mentally take work load, mention added stress pandemic. You’d expect behavior placebo group Social distancing ends community spread reduces manageable levels.

The vaccine goal, it’s tool reach goal. Shit go again. like people UK, make politicians take first Dude , guy sprouting nonsense. X.com company Elon founded merged Peter Thiel's coinfinity become PayPal. ""he wanted change name"".

And Elon , without getting details , literally one pivoted company current focus payments

From [David , founding COO product leader of PayPal till sale ebay, original business plan focused allowing people transfer money electronically via Palm hand-held computer. Musk quickly saw “killer” application would system allowed secure e-mailing payments using type PC, according Sacks, former PayPal COO. wonder many people wary taking vaccine that's fast tracked FDA approval makes sense. people unaware got kinds people groups draw conclusion based statistics guess. people f'in idiots forgot mention huge numbers suicides, deaths shut healthcare (canceled surgeries, cancer treatments, preventative healthcare etc) usually looks like too. Stonks read article blown horn? Yes ,its called “mushaf” app store Large scale physical distancing measures movement restrictions, often referred ‘lockdowns’, slow COVID‑19 transmission limiting contact people.
However, measures profound negative impact individuals, communities, societies bringing social economic life near measures disproportionately affect disadvantaged groups, including people poverty, migrants, internally displaced people refugees, often live overcrowded resourced settings, depend daily labour election it’s democrats fault got bad. 😂🤦‍♀️ every country US though. US$60 per person (plus logistics, healthcare personnel, etc costs) would unaffordable poorer countries. Sweden abject failure. messed things compared almost European country judged Nordic Baltic states, abysmal.  
  
The head Sweden's health ministry (or whatever there) resign immediately. None BS ""group immunity"" came true. Give people worked vaccines awards. Every single one. Creating vaccines good, soon emergence novel virus nothing short remarkable. 

COVID fucking done spring. relief. Trump take credit people staying home awhile end spread virus gimme gimme gimme! didn’t know whether got vaccine placebo, it’s highly unlikely 10-20x people got sick group riskier behavior. social distance though, important thing. People wear masks they're told moment. approval happens month early December, high risk healthcare workers vaccinated throughout December early January. We’re right track! I’ll take another stimulus go, please? understands afraid people use mask excuse follow important recommendation. probably completely unfounded fear. Russia release statement vaccine 97% effective Cops going enforce it. Wrong. worked ICU peak Phoenix. 30 40 year olds died. uncle died COVID (mid 60’s.) go ahead shut fuck something clearly know nothing about. Best advice far fuck would go test then. I'd say people idea difference traditional vaccine RNA vaccine, vaccine vaccine most. Oh, data this, know vaccination EVER claimed vaccine. spread misinformation literally prove wrong 5 seconds google search. lazy. Per Washington Post article earlier today, re: Moderna
""Of 95 cases covid-19 ... 90 group received placebo. 11 severe cases reported — people received placebo.""

Things looking good! Fingers toes crossed!  Hopefully like minks EU... people crazy questioning Trump safety shortcuts? Cool let's go back leeches blood letting.

Hey everyone!!!!! guy figured out!!!! Blood letting cures covid!!!!

Fucking dunce. Ahh makes sense. Yes, alcohol makes social distancing go right window Yep. isn’t going mass distributed then. it’s bit irresponsible think it’ll fine April MANDATORY FRENCH KISSING GUESTS Good - I'm glad someone's better! Dominic Donkey?

We know reindeer cannot climb hills Italy... Good point. also gotten 30s times. Yeah think MLB gonna let fans prove theyve vaccine. Nope—I still there. teachers decided go virtual school accommodated. Students also option go virtual coursework asynchronous meaning actual classes rather work due week (kind like modules). students accommodations learning disabilities, receive level instruction person classes provide. work special education student one one paraprofessional hanging :) So... forgive ignorance, determine two leading vaccines get? Moderna's vaccine clearly less logistical nightmare.

And hypothetical aside, danger getting jabbed both? Same, thankful option 100 million people vaccinated isn’t going send things back normal. don’t know you’d even begin think that. 

The logistics storing sub 0 temps aren’t figured out. 19-49 year olds vaccinated 33% flu based numbers find. 

After watched temper expectations wife got flu shot mid September. symptoms. low grade fever muscle aches couple days arm hurt couple days felt slightly painful couple weeks. 

Spiciest flu shot recall getting. However, also anxiety reaaaallly good hyper-fixating things. 

Was 100% worth it, wanted share others get alarmed post-shot symptoms stronger you’re accustomed to. Plus, millions people take vaccine get side effects (reasonable) skeptics come around Well, combined two studies 70,000 people short term side effects least (nothing vaccine). could long term side effects know about, also know much long term effects covid. Haha imagine ignorant think Monclef Soulai, scientist said would literally quit politics interfered vaccine, world renowned scientist, part anti science administration. I’m even saying I’m learning shit atm sound ridiculous weak healthcare system absolutely cannot afford outbreak measles rubella whatever. certain referring downtown part Gatineau, Quebec, sits across river Ottawa known Hull decades amalgamation years back. many European countries I’m sure poorer people pay comparatively taxes, also comparatively don’t need spend much costs won’t fall “taxes” bucket US would countries: healthcare, retirement, education, unemployment, etc. Kanye Adam Sandler sure come long way acting, huh I'd love see data - thing wonder lockdowns specifically two things - general government 'feelings' towards lockdowns bit softer feeds states voters - - likely workers WFH vs not.  said next month.

They seem conservative press release. kidding, dude? Masks magic bullet completely stop infection. Maybe consider seeing people following rules. Measles polio effectively eradicated US. Take free bridge. realized huge swath Americans love/hate relationship holidays. Maybe living huge cosmopolitan like LA makes jaded, many colleagues friends holiday get-togethers highlight year. would say 1/3 peers out-of-state go back home every single year. Missing one huge deal us. guess Americans akin wedding funeral. Dogs restaurants even without covid around. exclude useless shit 200b. rest went corporate bailouts.  Take grain salt. mean, workplaces, schools, libraries etc. like, MAX 8 people sitting table restaurant. people understand panic, logic. *Yes*, healthy people getting severe reactions COVID. like healthy people get severe life-threatening reactions viral infection, including common cold. like seemingly healthy people drop dead undiagnosed aneurysms. 

What’s important rate severe permanent damage. Even though happens, it’s super low healthy populations. way see it, you’re 20-30 year old worried getting permanent damage COVID, also worried developing autoimmune disorder kind encephalitis common cold too. events really unlikely “worth” worrying day-to-day basis. 

But like said, people don’t understand basic logic. Go r/COVID19 want see discussion without people getting super emotional retarded. sub pure fearmongering, awful makes people downplay *real* effect COVID at-risk populations.  biggest issue think vaccines themselves, may widespread reluctance take them. *bioNtech I’ve already that. NNN 2020 ungodly shit. probably wait whether want governments prioritizing vulnerable groups.

Although TBH take vaccine approved scientists coronavirus proven orders magnitude worse vaccines. lot even asymptomatic young patients seen heart damage.

It statistically might even worth waiting week JJ depending chances catching virus. Yeah - somehow turned mowing lawn weekend afternoon drinking party myself! Glad finally getting cold take break. :-/ Yeah, normally flu shot makes little sniffly warm face. year's shot gave worst body aches. Still glad got it. *bioNtech Double blind standard, would hope is. Haha, calm Vancouver Canada, rising too. I've said couple times already year, Texas one states I'd really wanted drive through, rate. Fuck year. Hopefully good stuff stranger! got covid last month didn’t get tested wouldn’t known. Cheaper hospitalization (though know sound argument make) define Covid-19 way do?

In way could measure would use describe patients develop Covid-19 (i.e., symptoms) predominantly received placebo vaccine?

Without full data one say. numbers press release, peer-reviewed study. Also like vaccine instantly ends things. 

e.g., million people got virus last week. instantly vaccinated whole country 95% effective vaccine, 50,000 people still would gotten it.

It's going ramp down, gain speed people get vaccinated, like we're going get vaccinated immediately jump mosh pits. should’ve wait till Thanksgiving announce this. everyone isn’t gonna care large gatherings go gym, also southwest burbs, made facility ""no judgement zone"" whether wear mask. basically means whatever want. I'm pretty much one wearing mask wash hands every set weights need find somewhere else go. can’t make shit he’s moron. That’s why. Ya 7 days later whole thing.

It’s no-brainer trade-off. Hopefully everyone sees way. Fuckin it. start fining people don’t. work 50 people machine shop three us wear mask. It’s fuckin ridiculous.

My aunt huge trumper anti masker, always preaching it’s human rights wear mask, died morning 7:10am. pre-existing conditions healthy woman mid 50s.

It’s time step up. That's except surgical underneath fastened ear saver. Swedish article leaked mails Swedish response. everyone seem obsessive little country post untranslated source. consider fact horrible side effects could possible. good luck recounts whatever  could viruses electron microscopes germ theory disease. 

In case, unlike dragons, proof reinfections exist.   Sho nuf! stay-home order entail? Would individual able go walk outside? stage that's choice.

It's low-risk people, we'll take chances, everyone risk tolerance. got lazy MA. People let guard down. think biggest contributing factors contract tracing social gatherings couple restaurants following protocols. Unfortunately, idiots everyone else going suffer. government India dare make vaccine expensive. Opposition term evil greedy bastards win.  Thank science wonderful blessing. Also something that's discussed much (because currently unknown) long vaccines provide immunity. 3 months, 6 months, 1 year longer? Hopefully longer side, we're talking boosters needed every 6 months (or even every year), that's additional serious logistical hurdle.  question asking though actual peak? many cases/deaths day enough finally get us take seriously act country combat it. 

I used say stats available ""during"" pandemic kinda like check baseball/football/hockey player stats 10 mins play. representative. 

When done know real impact (kinda like WW2 jews death) families get massive medical bills afterwards ""care"". interferon responses different mRNA vaccines.

Same immune system different response. Wildlife populations decline along west coast last years due droughts followed bad winters. parts Oregon, California Nevada lost 50% deer population winter 2016-2017. Since populations poor recruitment fully rebounded. Poaching occur likely reason reduced amount game. define Covid-19 way do? thing disease without symptoms? (How somebody HIV+ develop AIDS?) measure would use describe patients develop Covid-19 (i.e., symptoms) predominantly received placebo vaccine?

Edit: link provided: explain 18 crowd twice (!) likely develop flu symptoms flu nearly always symptomatic? easy, Measles Polio would eradicated. 

We're close, Polio, after, what, 15 years serious hard work? setbacks recently, IIRC. Man partying work, taxes, worry next paycheck enough pay everything, going concerts, getting passed drunk, rebelling, making memories. matter time virus spread rural areas. particular, reservations high case counts driven numbers attributed rural areas. seriously trying compare man-made activities natural phenomenon? war virus? One literally planned effort. I’ll leave figure one.

Or saying people scenarios suddenly infected unknown virus dropped dead within week?

Even miraculously dropped dead, prevention scenarios involve impacting livelihoods BILLIONS people worldwide. Let’s say save 4 people died Benghazi, solution nuke entire Middle East. acceptable then? 4 people alive millions dead worse? morons don’t consider this: LOCKDOWNS MASSIVE SIDE EFFECTS America adopted toddler definition individualism: get whatever want nobody tell hold responsible anything do. Stab me, now! need roll shit now... Appreciate heads don’t announce unless it’s ready go! many implications stake. announce vaccine early people start lax hard safety precautions people get sick die there’s still 5 6 months go anyone getting cured... think contracting severe pneumonia coronavirus might something it? clue response supposed even mean.  shit doctors charge. shit nurses assigned multiple patients. shit nurses spend time patients. even seem like grasp situation. 

The patients negative pressure rooms, nurses full PPE. emergency, doctors often longer go help, stay hall yell instructions nurses - sometimes trying stabilize multiple patients turn pissing contest.

It's pissing contest. falsely accusing nurse video lying agenda, reality saying absolutely true clue. !remind 6 weeks

400k dead Xmas?
My guess: 317k bizarre sort organized movement fill gap.

Not really consider lack leadership coordination top. already 40 million doses ramping production week. companies waiting till approval make (which take time) even though took warp speed money...we turned warp speed funding, funded ourselves, risked losing millions vaccine didn’t work started production started phase 2 work (which thankfully) could ship day get fda approval country almost 26 million 1k deaths. Hope stays way. people want chip check every week pay Steve's cancer treatment chose smoke 5 packs day never exercised. Sounds right. IIRC, WSJ NYT reported White House projections back March 1 5 Americans would eventually catch it. Well given teachers get fucked left right wonder. least 50% think it’s hoax. Hospitals already strained multiple states, case numbers getting higher quickly. [an article published week *”Utah, Illinois, Minnesota, Colorado, states already reporting hospitals intensive-care units near capacity. bottleneck medical care isn’t lack space, even equipment, may able increase, staff—trained nurses doctors attend patients, cannot manufactured thin air. spring crisis New York tristate area, health-care workers around country rushed region, buttressing exhausted medical workforce. nationwide surge, doctors nurses needed hometown hospitals.”* It’s looking good all. ethical wearing masks pandemic? don’t think so. Exactly ! I'm sure Amazon workers would prefer jobs right now.  Gay stereotypes party much live hedonistic lifestyles could help needed most. hoaxers Twitter FB eat it. They’ll never Sergio was. would working 8am 8pm. really dedicated furthering education assignments always pretty involved students, meant grading difficult.

Luckily, virtual far, going back next semester stepdads failing health, choose. Lol no. safer screwed shutting college ruining housing. actually work (meaning can’t isolate I’m CONSTANTLY exposed COVID) physical health risk. I’m also mentally ill completely isolated things helping cope pre pandemic. It’s feelings :) I’m physical risk move back city I’m constantly work pay bills. everyone happy families. post empathy completely generalize humans families. programs insure children.... won't, frankly happen, pandemic would lead many people abandoned die middle life-saving care. Warped logic! 😂 You’d surprised corporate America put money.....healthcare different. 

Corporate health care balances much money squeeze benefits odds sued putting liability staff point fingers taken court. Doctor salaries something like 7-8% healthcare expenses country. even close ever issue.

In mind, pay value society. Doctors save lives pay significant toll so. me, invaluable lives job every day every task potentially life death, HCWs whole millionaires. worthy college football coaches. Nothing surprising anymore. Corporate consolidation going roof.

Carlin called 90s. design.    Shit like ruins day find it. It’ll everyone hospitals...again though, haven’t heard anything guys included all, us (the scientists) pushing guys get first dibs way company giving us first dibs working it. said...I don’t think it’ll big issue don’t include guys give us vaccine. We’ve manufacturing months ship soon get approval, already think 40 million doses made (and ramping production week passes). Us getting first basically instead us shipping doses, us going doctors/pharmacy get vaccinated, it’s moreso they’ll put 2k doses (or however many) batch vaccinate us right work...when start shipping, basically we’ll vaccinated like 2-3 days anybody else simply it’s made Awww want hurt feelings :( Sorry &lt;3 love troll someone watch die uneducated? Thats nasty. going Walmart delivery since seems supplies running low again. paper products aren’t stock:/ wasn’t even going hoard. I’m genuinely last roll.  FWIW wealthier affluent districts tend much better behaved children. also worked school Mormon population. kids perfectly behaved. told sooner Ofc. ""shut job"". absolutely passion. Master's education additional certificates. pressures administration treats teachers wears even passionate ones. state interest shutting down. Thanks Gov Lee think argument goes something like this:
The government shuts business. lose business. government offers help unemployment benefits, etc. I'm dependant government. I'll keep people power social programs like one feeding me. Ooh. Good know. I’ve thinking actually worse, aerosolize particles. cut middle men.

Yeah, like that, Congress control. demonizing seeing exactly middlemen using every dirty trick PR handbook create demons. also product unstated racism masses. see public symptoms years work make public opinion so. Public sentiment could probably turned around without constant extremely well-funded interference. unethical effective tactic use.

The very, large corporations ""the middlemen"" managed get legally classified people, means affect politics people do. Unlike actual people, spend millions keep billions coming. employ expensive armies professionals work full time keeping things way are, making worse. opposition try fight back also holding full-time job raising children, working three jobs support themselves. send lobbyists directly halls government secure interests well-funded bribes. opposition yell internet, they're ignored.

That's problem. easy point problem, nearly impossible anything meaningful it. 

I'd appreciate lot general conversation would shift away people wondering Americans bear live like this. Instead, let focus how, exactly, country managed secure preferable situation seems exist elsewhere. see get here. One thing I've learned rideshare driver people straight way much shit - busybodies everywhere many things things suck major ass worth doing. Found wanker. Yes love 20 getting sent home college end dropping unstable housing! work dangerous essential job reapplied college! Well look like shutting maybe January spring aren’t clear can’t tell landlord job time know. means might drop again! makes sense screwed people over. safer live work big city unstable housing would allow live residentially college? feel like got screwed intentionally almost, even though know wasn’t. Shutting university basically fucked life everyone stable home lives one college government seems care about. sure universe safer college kids working living old parents stuck campus low risk people. everyone “sTay hOme” safe shitty jobs. Found edge lord. wish would figured whole student teaching instead grad school Yep, got them. Enough live comfortably lavishly. number moves around area area. Doctors many countries universal healthcare systems don’t get paid nearly much doctors America. America’s for-profit healthcare system needs dismantled.  fucking tired . covid duties since July prepared 2nd wave here. Fuck shit county still virtual issue statement return, masks required certain age. mean 32 kids single room given time. overcrowded go back year. republicans. hard lol. entire party crazy ground up. Next gop guy crazier Trump. Watch.  Unfortunately, doctors screwed much, more, socialized medicine. guys supposed talking position see logical error is, realize world fine, sleep soundly tonight. 

This sucks. Also unthinkable capitalists. many groups actively trying privatize school, roads, infrastructure. That's one worst things Devos Barrett U need kn95 level masks, community spread widespread  wild true. talk lethality seems odd. It’s like virus switch off, right? start less lethal Italy back 2019 mutate China? Thanks! think speak health care workers say: don’t need gratitude, Americans stay home wear mask properly public! every American (or least 90%) took seriously would making progress. know two three chose work loved didn’t want find something else do, hobby, spend time with. never discussed third. took early retirement due illness, pandemic hit, happy things worked out, illness aside. Poverty hilarious, really

If base say lies random baseless assumptions me, really nothing better shut every fast food joint America tax hell sugar really want take stance. Heart disease kills fair COVID-19.

I know you’d really love everyone died could yell “I told so” empty streets you’re going fall back asleep happen. I’m really sorry you’re going through. lot us care making sacrifices stay in. It’s enough people. Even half people stay wear masks do, it’s enough people stop slow down. corporate pockets... always start.

Glad realized fucked system is. needs national effort Victoria, need stop importing frozen stuff while. UCSF? don’t understand people hoard TP. really think grocery stores close point? primary care doc — loved got specialist appointment leading diagnosis chronic condition plagued 5 years — sabbatical right now. fucking HMO closed clinic. pandemic. 

This centrally located women’s health clinic located mass transit served women backgrounds income levels. take 2 hours way get doctor rather 45 minutes.

I’m disgusted. similar system Australia. pay go private skip public queue elective surgeries and/or private room. Mostly, hospital doctors. I'm pretty sure pay, choose surgeon too.

But everyone covered treated, regardless ability pay beautiful thing. thought required make differences hours training commonwealth countries? Since work many hours/year, 3 year residency equivalent 4-5 year residency countries. could wrong that, I've never looked super seriously, family Australia thought crossed mind. seen posts. Hence, comment.

Lots playing defense attempts move goal posts.

No recognition Tegnell's utter failure better results achieved Scandinavian nations. 

An endless parade denial. I’m tired winning. disagree emails suggesting that. call ""hovering bottom."" worst place be, imo. everything sucks, never quite hit rock bottom. prolonged pain, enough actually make change. people live like theat entire lives. wouldn’t wear something blocks least 90% FUCKIN TIME? living knees, rise up. going pricks top encourage dumb sons bitches stand garbage system. took pandemic wake up, FYI, son’s birth bill one million dollars.

You see, wife’s water broke four? six? weeks early, put high risk infection, want stay hospital; it’s early deliver healthy baby (given choice waiting), so. around 38 weeks risks rebalance it’s time deliver. wasn’t ready come, induce 3 times told yanking unless performed c section (turns out, lots reasons unrelated individual care, hospitals averse c sections). Blah blah, week mommy care three weeks baby intensive care.

Look around literally everyone pick someone random. don’t $1mil savings, execute mother child, happens something like ... checks notes... 1 10 US babies.  heck happen?   Define reasonable.
Every stakeholder would different definition
Everyone wants someone else's labor cheaper I'm even rural area, ""representatives"" give fuck. Welcome Texas. Lutinant Governor record saying, ""Grandma &amp; grandpa gladly die save economy."" Spokes &amp; Lt Dan could give two fucks.  There's talk limited supply high risk populations(seniors/Healthcare workers) next couple months. Nothing firm obviously.  Lawyers refuse represent clients time. 

Your firefighter example also stupid. Sure wouldn’t refuse enter burning building. doctor also won’t refuse save patient coding right front them. patient abandonment laws. 

The fire fighter example equivalent would like saying it’s wrong firefighter quit job 9/11.

EMt’s refuse go they’re assigned? Get fired. 

Physicians allowed quit jobs whenever want. logic fucking stupid.  youtuber called bald bankrupt, got covid couple months ago said didnt get boner 30 days. seen update 30 days pretty long able get boner, even morning wood.   Congrats win! Argus Leader trash news. Kristi trash. whole state trash. It’s every industry. Thx ""First, mainstream media Hollywood establishment must major collaborators effort. ""

Lol rather symbolic want people behave like spring. Hopefully effect people since many restrictions use without breaking law.

They need find way limit stores ""behave"". lot outside jurisdictional area... Yes, amount actual risk unknown. keep window open humidifier running?  celebs posting YouTube, Twitch, instagram, tiktok, etc effecient completely unreselient. soon stressors, system collapses. drink 22h pretty much lockdown?? Huh? Thanks!

The article, interestingly, also mentions serological findings sewer samples.

Because seeing second rapid spread virus even masks distancing, seems like virus got much contagious end 2019? Otherwise hospitals would overflown december 2019 instead March 2020?

It's confusing...  exactly 95% effective mean? seen sides. Bunch husband’s coworkers it. didn’t symptoms. like strep. 

But kid went school with. parents died within week other. Plus I’m hearing stories like people dying. 

Life hasn’t changed us. I’m burned out. haven’t physically store/restaurant since March. spend time outside weather nice man looking forward winter months.  Depends live.

Presumably western nations get bulk doses first try heavily vaccinate populations, they’re willing.

The goal herd immunity vaccines. disease isn’t going anywhere. Eventually stamped crippling pandemic (but still festering) west even areas lower vaccine rate mix vaccine easy measures like masks. long R0 drops 1, spread slows.

But problem going back “normal” virus still there. pockets across world. People still get sick local outbreaks need contained *especially* vaccine rates high enough people think they’re returning normal high enough actually establish herd immunity.

At point key making life normal possible aggressive contact tracing, small outbreaks limited. trace contacts contacts contacts get stay home nip minor outbreaks bud. thing *while* widespread vaccinations.

So there’s “new normal” coming while, it’s living life now. It’s something 2019 2020. Probably mostly, entirely, “normal”. it’ll take time get there. true herd immunity vaccines, it’s old world knew one endemic disease. sparsely populated isolated island edge world like NZ.

I'm NY, no, restrictions ended.  trying ways. 

you want count ""confirmed"" cases, yet using 10 million infections rather small number people strain sequenced twice ""confirm"" it. major differences would say? that's people think too....until land hospital want beg people take seriously. gotten really old.  Sure, principle applies basically first world country. 3rd world countries (or super poor areas 1st world) obviously able get get oxford one due stable shelf life needing refrigerated. talked back March flattening curve big concern healthcare system would get overwhelmed influx patients. Well, we've failed. exactly happening right now. ERs run. local ICU beds working contingency plans. Hopefully get hit car right could fucked. Trump said they'd free global consortium countries working make sure lower GDP countries get high risk populations vaccinated - richer countries help subsidize vaccination costs poorer countries. rich countries can't go ahead vaccinating lower risk populations high risk populations countries consortium vaccinated. 

The US chose participate Code blues average around 30 minutes, range 10 minutes hour. Depends patient showing response, sick/injured patient is, busy/staffed hospital/ward time.  5th vaccine: 140% coming Russia Yeah UK particular going use lot Imperial College vaccine comes successor earlier vaccines, lot countries Lots tiktoks feed nurses doctors saying bad wave is. Really frustrating watch folks work wild conditions. hope gets better, least sake doctors nurses. gonna announce results Oxford vaccine? part Operation Warp Speed? Pfizer Moderna turned super effective, waiting AZ publish results well (which think week sure). Hang there, we’re almost guys! importantly, thawed last 30 days refrigerator. 

The Pfizer vaccine lasts three four days fridge it’s thawed. Amazing, hope shun 75% vax. Supply limited. actually work ... interesting think I'm probably gonna keep wearing masks I'm sick too. Yeah, cold flu low death rates, they're still fun I'll spare others pain. Belgium third tourists Netherlands (no point comparing France here). Brussels airport, fraction traffic three airports mentioned. Urbanisation unique Belgium. ""national character"" bullshit unscientific someone get.

I even mad you. people explain Sweden's numbers totally lack lockdown attempt contextualize mocked, sort facts brought defend Belgium Good luck, stay safe. I'm picking Walmart size comes influence. think big corporations decided safe, others would follow suit. know manager local gas station complained customers yelled employees young. leads employees quitting.  Honestly, I'd take meant die choking alone hospital staff, equipment, space help me. also time find effective vaccines general population long remain effective. 

Do protect full illness prevent severe illness? 

people higher risk simply want even 'mildly' sick week two want keep wearing masks

also even vaccines avaiable tomorrow everyone everywhere enough supplies gloves &amp; ppe - total anti vax people &amp; wary people want ot see others react getting one.

plus people can't get vaccinated matter much want to. I'm going keep wearing mask wore masks knew sick. want make someone sick worse going grocery shopping.  cohort “someone know ~38 got died fat think heart attack, coronavirus killed him.” actually know college educated person said this. Better yet? roommate best friend long time knows literally study heart disease living, said sentence me. It’s complete denial problem. Twitter complaining... aren’t giving attention trust *experts* (doctors, immunologists, geneticists, etc) say mRNA vaccines alter DNA. trust someone named ""padizzledonk"" Reddit. statement certainly altering something body.

There's difference ""altering something body"" altering DNA itself. eat apple altering inside body. Yea that’s true, it’s mrna based society degrade rapidly readily kept extremely cold. weren’t trying get ASAP we’d spend time trying figure stabilize it, again, we’re trying get quickly...and since we’ll using distribution won’t bad Yeah , I’m sure error bars they’re comparable. Pfizer/BioNTech 8 94 symptomatic cases vaccine, Moderna 5 95. Combine headphones vaporwave/synthwave soundtrack.

My partner jokingly refer going grocery store ""supply run"".

Whatever get chuckle day. helps. shit. :)

Does anyone actually think masks social distancing would last forever. 23 years got polio vaccine. post r/conservative telling grow up? Fascist tool. far lockdown, that's argument. Lockdown mostly proven effective short term. FHM argued fewer restrictions (i.e. recommending example) better long-term solution. fever part body’s immune response vaccine, means it’s working. mild fever, tiredness, etc. good things body running training course defend actual virus. if/when you’re exposed, immune system already defense prepared covid shut get going. Perhaps advising, people wear two kinds masks instead one. wear KN95 + neck gaiter, surgical mask + neck gaiter, combination. Ill honest. Denmark much shock Sweden handled pandemic Norway Denmark handled it. like two seperate universes.

Its crazy advice goverments around world getting differs much. Considering challenging deal Pfizer one logistically (keeping cold), think that's perfectly reasonable price difference. Probabpy ends cheaper distribute many situations. US doctors lobbying frightening people ""socialized medicine"" decades, act like agency. Willing pay $60 less financially able get $3 one free. question havent seen specifically addressed whether vaccine's effectiveness tied people still wearing masks social distancing? TIA  Stupid question, would vaccine refreeze safely? us absolutely needs yesterday. keep working vaccines, one needed us. Drug use, alcohol use, diet. they're like increasing taxes something small. money's coming somewhere already government's pocket Wealthier countries pay it. everyone's interest. telling people identify themselves? black Americans identify African. Jamaican. Trinidadian. ones celebrate cultures identify such. You’re downvoted you’re coming ignorant. Cut hours restaurants bars. Recommend masks. Ask everyone stay home much possible sense they'll pass year. desantis idiot believes herd immunity. joke bad feel bad. He’s probably one base would trust from. Good point. heart attack outrageously unhealthy later years. big emergency field hospitals built around country? activated? 

I know never got used. still empty fairgrounds. Agreed. saying won’t responsable people, non-insignificant % USA be. need least 5 We're still least year widespread vaccination talking someone weekend similar sentiment. distancing keeping activities outdoors - masks social settings - duration. limited contact husband ER physician don’t feel right running around whatever want - even though low risk. don’t mind lick wearing mask, giving mask restrictions “power” life- like people claim it’s “control.” 

Anyway, entire time- “afraid dying” (although, also, flouting rules hubris husband see ill among age group... though survive said look comfortable come in)... AFRAID SPREADING. similar you, DISAPPOINTED community BS spin even “lockdowns” (there weren’t - could go hobby lobby, Lowes, Harris teeter day - even every single day - one stopping you).... it’s political team.

Ummm fuck you???? Also, husband accused getting “covid bucks” effing dumb. I’m mentally exhausted it’s anti-mask STUPIDITY let community thinks special little snowflakes public health. 

Anyway, convoluted response, sorry rant made sense. wanted chest agree you. 

I say “it’s ‘me’ it’s also could infect.” many older ladies refuse wear masks tell “okay” take mine off. pointedly say - “I think would prefer keep on, husband high risk procedures regularly although blessed PPE held thus far- 1700+ health care workers gone unlucky group somehow - would prefer take one else us. I’ll keep chances spreading minimum mask on. Thanks understanding” 🙄🙄🙄🙄 5%? presumable fatality rate? Fauci said probably start role mid December health care elderly. Regular non-high risk people April July.  that's exactly pharmacos find legitimate ask month's salary cheap medicine. That’s true all. We’ll relatively normal next spring/summer. even movement right now. 

It’s also disinformation movement late. 

I’m pro vaccines don’t trust administration I’d hard time believing anything promoted Trump safe. I’m alone bunch friends don’t trust vaccines coming either. 

He done huge disservice country cannot STFU. 

It makes bitter want hope instead I’m full doubt. 

This virtual school husband runs errands work outside house. 

My kids don’t go anywhere appointments absolutely needed stirred much chaos people refuse wear masks cases skyrocketing. 

I want excited. want hopeful boy makes difficult part believes he’s purpose. Pfizers hand needs stored -78C something ridiculous potent short time unfreezing it. Got *necessary*. developed countries paying rest. possible limited immunity, r0 needs get 1 fizzles out. stamp let rage countries, find way back. fair like 1.5 months away. She’d probably read whole book store say it’s right employee says can’t read entire book without paying.   suspect Pfizer Moderna vaccines rolled December emergency basis risk people lower risk get AstraZeneca vaccine next year. saying cannot trust theoretical estimates pharmaceutical companies long history data regarding vaccines prove this. yes, time tell. would like do?  Same. someone want get vaccinated, fine. I'm still I'm able to. Hell, I'll wear mask bit longer to, fuck social distancing. shame. Russia much advancement science named fucking propaganda outlet greatest achievement all. hope turn around country, lot offer world. Silly rabbit! Rounding errors richies...

*points* hamster wheels there. may not. Pfizer testing stability higher temperatures. likely fine, initially tested there.  Jeff Bezos could eat bill still 140 billion left over.  sounds like going tech support model. that's good plan health care let alone software. Italy population 60 million, 1/6 United States, equivalent 238,000 new cases.  mrna vaccines medical game changer People lot give credit for.

For example, children affected disporportionally disease instead seniors, people would find motivation.

Humans tough species. People pushed limits. People pushed limits willingness, based risk level children personally. 

I'm tired hearing ""we can't take anymore."" ancestors endured things 100x worse. care much personal risk low people care about. is... young people. Lmao that’s mRNA vaccines work. mRNA contains instructions building coronavirus proteins, mRNA gets absorbed body’s cells, cells read instructions build proteins, immune system sees proteins foreign builds response. DNA cell remains intact. essentially gets cells act factories little dead pieces virus without changing DNA using viruses, that’s makes new technology special. significance news? Switzerland high infection rate, would expect completely spared? source this, know numbers worked out?  Lmao would cool even close lockdown. Yup. see everyday disgusting, amount cases getting extremely scary speak experience working salon strict masks business I've seen. that, hand washing, acrylic partitions face shields, high standard sanitation, outbreaks started *in* salon. I'm sick Covid, get work got husband work contacts. Also, first shutdown Whit pissed lot stylists telling people ""use google"" figure cut hair home. Also, point essential health, lots little old ladies simply incapable washing hair. Many even keep shampoo/conditioner home. I'm nail tech kind work gray area cosmetology podiatry work ladies' feet. diabetic circulatory issues, neglecting feet well result amputation digits whole foot. see they're going try keep us open ask everyone best behavior. think going slow spread enough keep hospitals overwhelmed.

I'm thinking telling im going.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Here's make sense poc whole service level jobs therefore spend time sun probably whole normal levels vitamin D. Like said unmeasurable. may accurate per policy, far obviously incorrect. It’s likely turn Pfizer one similar stability, don’t numbers yet. ingredients used keep biological materials shelf stable fairly similar, think Pfizer probably pushed working product door quickly, stability testing completed. Canada frustrating doctor shortage. graduation typically run States extra cash. 

I hope they're happy now. I'm prioritizing ones' country, pandemic global scale, best thing every country help citizens help many possible people infected (either inside ones country), likely people get infected. Thank minimizing coronavirus every day? 

Thank telling people lost family members ""don't let covid run life""? 

Thank bare minimum making mask wearing political issue? 

Thank providing states sort cohesive strategy confronting covid?

Thank providing states kind funding order distribute vaccines?

Thank blocking Joe Biden's transition team getting information need carry vaccination entire country?

I never understand people like like support Trump worship like poor people North Korea thank Kim Jong Un everything lives.    Lmao wait minute.

So heavily reported young people die, ""it's big deal rare news"".

And heavily reported young people die, big deal ""hey look there's cases young people dying news""

So exactly people going believe it? Dead people can't come back tell you, waiting for? No. Better. read One must remember Sweden can't physically lock people issue order wear masks constitution. recommend action hope people pick that. course private business whatever like, grand scale can't force people it. That's rumour said gonna happen they're gonna release heartgold, omega ruby black one collection soul silver, alpha sapphire white another collection That’s saying. year functionally ended pandemic. Man, American, *painfully* accurate. hate poorly we're handling many people give fuck. frustrating, especially people claim careful, they're still going gym, restaurants, bars, movies, etc. I'm sitting like, nah, that's careful morons. Sweden right run bunch neoliberal conservatives Every time refreeze virus lose infectivity, depending virus/buffer around log, can. That's something next summer fall, year passed since first people vaccinated. States actually going back lock now. exactly looking receiving vaccine? expecting you? Reading comment scary. many Americans really smart making money, smart hurt people whole. Double edged sword. almost seems way burn country rebuild ground. 😩 well Pfizer waited biden projected winner. lol Good! cost relatively small, gives US chance rebuild global image, I'm helping poor countries get everyone vaccinated. redirect doses US countries US nearly completely vaccinated.  That’s true Republicans saying there's 6% room lock ~~slaves~~ prisoners? Dakotas soon test case herd immunity. rate going 70% population covid year's end. always science offered ""the side"". 

In Michigan...we still know actual metrics used descision making science behind open closed.

Within 72 hours county health department state health department used ""science"" contradicted one another safty high schools open, example. data set. Science.  Totally. Changing custom really difficult.

At least keep carrying hand sanitizer, guess. think people making bigger deal we'll actually face, supply still exceed demand. Skeptics continue body data grows doses come production line. 

Skepticism become problem vaccines people want them, think we're still year away from. dakotas horrible places outside winter. cold pushes day means breathing air science community specifically says viruses mutate become contagious less deadly.  *every* possible way. Remember hospital blown up? Imagine, will, day April, finally get vaccine hyped months. Freedom , take mask awhile.

Bad news, weeks after, get sick. Covid? Whoops, you’re 5 percent isn’t applicable vaccine. Gotta wait everyone else get vaccinated stop wearing mask time again. 

Then, assholes TV protesting Michigan still vaccine hoax control people, Dave office eating chips day without mask. keeps talking Trump better president. It’s 11am. HCW don’t enough respirators N95 masks. Imagine average American bought 100 back March bad shortage would be? That’s billing works. 

$13k EOB. Insurance negotiated rate lower amount, say $10k. auditors ends make sure paperwork proper.

You deductible, copay, pocket max factors much pay. insurance. Insurance pays part $10k bill. pay part. 

Larger companies usually self insured insurance company admin work. might BCBS costs payed employer. 

Companies use insurance way get retain talent. don’t want uncontrolled costs.

It’s malpractice insurance drives costs. testing reduces liability something goes wrong. also tend replace equipment often bleeding edge comes much higher cost, private rooms countries. 

We also higher mortality rates people don’t preventative care don’t insurance don’t know insurance covers preventative 100%. Maternity care one areas, higher mortality rate. 

We socialized healthcare elderly poor. take action enroll. Also Americans make choice buy insurance since young / healthy. donut hole poverty rate well enough buy insurance afford deductible. new limit part Public Order Act therefore law, recommendation like many Sweden's coronavirus measures. People violate ban organising larger events could face **fines even imprisonment six months.** Petition keep ""under wraps"" good. Yeah still major advantage Pfizer's happened next? I'll save time: went enforced, hard lockdowns citizens complied. OP replied said.

Remind whole lockdown compliance thing going here... military run government. city hospital private business. happens people fight tooth nail public healthcare United States. Cool all. side effects? wants d\*\*mer... Generally, working biological material, keep extremely cold. helps avoid sort degradation, or, impurities present, prevents stuff like destroying proteins. Obviously final product wouldn’t impurities, development stages may matter. 
We keep stuff cold like know it’s condition good test it. 

Once solid, well tested product works, begin stability testing. Time increments temperatures chooses based common standards. would test -70C, -20C, 2-8C (refrigerator temp). temp would test different period times, 1 week, 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 years, 5 year, 10 years. Obviously issue **wait** long urgent need drug, Pfizer focused getting effective product market ASAP conducting stability tests. 

The stuff used stabilize vaccines pretty standard, probably minor formulation changes company trade secret. *long annoyed inhale* know it’s soon someone give realistic timeline vaccination programmes may start, long take, etc? 

Just general would like information vaccines third trial (AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson). many doses needed each? many vaccines produced short term? 

I know it’s still soon, someone could briefly explain link would great. true, strain medical infrastructure would also lessen. living without concern prior covid, aforementioned issues still existed viruses. difference didn’t worry bed available medical emergency. Yes, requires change constitution law would collide constitutional freedom movement. means law proposal decision, one parliament election renewed decision parliament. 95 cases covid-19, disease caused virus, 90 group received placebo. 11 severe cases reported — people received placebo.

Does anyone know 11:90 ratio typical many people end getting severe case COVID? think statistic hear around 3% end dying it, 12% getting ill coronavirus pretty significant too. Eh no. Lots countries capitalist that's case. think culture. sure answer this, contraindications people receiving vaccine? Pretty much anyone advised get it? I've severe adverse reactions flu vaccine sure I'll eligible due reason well several autoimmune diseases. “No.” - Mitch McConnell costs dose administer yeah, working vaccine bargin point Terrifying $5000 point call cosmicprank. always finds ways self-promote sub point he's creator, often generic comments barely touches article question. time story even check out.  Risk food exceptionally minimal Yet Egypt teaches students get close. uh, they're mRNA based vaccines uh, pretty good? government doesn’t run healthcare services, remember? government “draft” citizens force private businesses (hospitals clinics)? yet another reason many need public healthcare system like every developed country. something told still claim “tried everything”. poor nurses. 

The PTSD seeing health care workers going keep seeing going devastating. Majority public think safe celebs poke them. quite others would like see long term safety studies. I'm hoping someone help out. wife teacher, kid class tested positive. whole class except wife sent home quarantine. wife developed symptoms Friday gotten worse since then, go tested yesterday. dr said, based symptoms, almost certain covid, everyone house start quarantining 14 days. 

I updating supervisors throughout weekend, saying still go work positive test result. accurate? maybe sink even then. One week, who’s counting correctly, right? mostly speculation, think large part Americans giving fact majority identifies Christian. Following Jesus would mean helping poor needy.

My mom told great example. couple months ago feeding homeless group church. said nobody else group wearing mask except her. nearing 70. brought group leader said something along lines ""Oh, believe that"". 

It makes wonder. Christians good deeds genuinely care signal tribe ""good"" christian are? One cannot ignore fact time great crisis many basics help fellow human. course, I'm putting Christians box. interesting think about. I’m sorry loss. tragic outcome poorly thought-out decision make stay-at-home orders less important necessary. lack quarantine enforcement led vulnerable citizens become exposed first place. think spring bc death rate would minuscule at-risk people healthcare workers vaccinated. point, restrictions would harm good fair amount Lord mother guilting go Grandma's Thanksgiving...I guess cool potentially killing mother smh prioritization rubrics timetables rollout

We know overall shape already, details.

First, medical personnel high risk population.

Last, ""normal people"".

There series steps between, depending deemed ""essential"" ""high risk"".

If like (work home, healthy adult), fall last wave. understand households 8 people Reached herd immunity tests hospitalizations deaths down? Messenger RNA, memory RNA whatever is. 

Messenger RNA temporary carrier instructions make stuff body. tons body every second every day. So, they're sending instructions make piece outside shell virus body fight that. fine cautious since done name think scary. 40 percent U.S. residents say plan gather groups 10 people holiday season, according [recent survey](http://osuwmc.multimedia-newsroom.com/index.php/2020/11/12/survey-nearly-2-in-5-americans-will-likely-attend-large-holiday-gatherings/) Ohio State University (OSU) Wexner Medical Center.

For November 3, 2020, IHME reports 67% (interactive U.S. population say always wears mask public. November 16, time writing, estimated size U.S population November 15, Johns Hopkins University reported COVID-19 daily deaths US. 
     
For November 3, 2020, IHME reports 92% (interactive Republic Korea (South Korea) population say always wears mask public. November 16, time writing, estimated size South Korea population November 15, Johns Hopkins University reported [1 (one) COVID-19 daily death South Korea. This. say they're certain prevent severe disease? They're saying evidence pointing way, is. Trump already taking credit it. authors fired. pretty cut dried. They've already found way get transported using suitcases protecting 10 days - mainly non issue current moment yes present greater challenge I’m next weeks we’re going start seeing lot news people getting covid again.

A handful people get every million cases. nothing concerned about. ""Sweden didnt even burrow money save lifes"" isnt actually good look. Good explanation. 2020 finishing strong. current protocol, yes. However quarantining voluntarily possible smart. School *only* daycare.

It unreasonable parents set households hold jobs children school. makes little sense set society way one parent household *must* stay home day, given 99% time children school.

It also good equality schools serve, sense, daycare, child rearing (historically) fallen women, decreased career opportunities earning potential.

I obviously *do* agree you, though, primary purpose schools create educated populace able make informed, rational decisions lives voting booth.  put fan box fan window.... Agreed No, wasn't. anyone able read knows that. Except redditors desperate spread lies unknown reason. Pathological maybe. Possibly best summary Sweden's current legal circumstance. save comment link whenever redditors make big claims government do.  Yea Let's go golfing Yes, also grocery store workers, restaurant staff, meat packers, etc. People low-paying, in-person jobs can't isolate get sick. People likely live dense multifamily housing rely shared transport. actually ship commercial freezer trucks railway cars, unlike Pfizer one almost impossible transport distances.

Why so? mRNA based vaccine? really care people choose take it. option enough bury national problem. Eradicating virus ever going happen metric success. average person worry Covid much Polio, we're good shape. What’s going saving ""one life"" come fuck now. Yes. “quaranteam” consisting sister family, know fact careful family, still don’t hang inside without masks. No, spring massive scale vaccinations basically begin (small scale start soon next month).

If thinking returning ""normal"" (whatever heck anymore), think like Q3/Q4 2021. Vaccination starts make dent early February. things opened Easter. Pandemic phase officially Memorial Day US, North America, Europe. Fall 2021 everywhere else. Masks required doctor offices, airports, hospitals foreseeable future. Masks 100% prevent infection appear lessen viral dose thus severity disease. So, telling me, way things going, need 100 million doses instead 200M....  someone undergoing chemo able take vaccine? God unexpectedly teared that. Also, herd immunity valid strategy, imagine lot assholes distancing wearing masks either current trajectory likely Covid February already matter folks try protect them. They'll probably antibodies might ameliorate effects idiocy others short-term die. They'll probably kill lots get vaccine.  Lol work, what's problem? know reading Twitter little headache inducing, able get it, highly praising vaccines, relieved see. think he's going root anti vaccine movement. BNO Always point. would say “This.” adds absolutely nothing conversation may well said nothing. get shop available personally, course feel safer going eat, shopping, etc. would agree general. But, status quo (the likely rule moment) ""vaccines given healthcare/essential workers"". 

So proposal rich, gives option get vaccine. doubt would oppose it.

For rest population, depends many vaccines reserve essential workers many sold profit, price set. would oppose selling 50% profit $500: really prioritize people risk, $500 low. sell 5% profit $50k each, money raised way used something non-controversial (e.g. helping people got sick covid pay bills), doubt get much opposition group. sure mad government barely taking measures glad they're implementing nonsensical ones least. ""our state green zone now. still mask on?"" husband said pretty much exactly that. wouldn’t even spending Tgiving parents grandparents weren’t COVID year (we’d flying see family), said Tgiving two us said would “a slap face” grandparents 🤦‍♀️ Well, bigger slap face someone gives gives pregnant sister COVID... Yeah, Pfizer realistic. Moderna decided give us decimals. little early decimals. would pay much attention stuff decimal point.

Both 90%, that's said reliably now. great news. looks like living fantasy calendar whole damn time! Wow! would've thought?! Vaccines likely available frontline healthcare workers late dec Jan. Expect wider rollout Feb. May people getting shots begin put dent R number. June/July hopefully see stuff reopen stages. November think we'll see holiday shopping basically normal.

If govt smart hope work grocers wage heavy high exposure jobs get vaccinated right doctors. would help drop R value faster think. Suspiciously low huh? bet trump take full credit one  want someone charge child could look good influence inspired. seems people thing past  I'm optimistic too. Just, expect anything happen. takes longer bottlenecks production distribution chains factors dynamic situation, take bit longer. plan anything big April, wait act responsibly meantime. There's nice way say this, say sort thing weaken message. Saying ""I support X, also stuff even though power change anything without X"" weak message. Say ""I support making corporations criminally responsible climate change"" much better!

Remember, we're getting land back; claimed saltwater oceans. Effectively, Exxon Mobil pulling Chernobyl every years, timeframe future human habitation *longer* Chernobyl incident. 

That's counting droughts, famines, displacement, civil wars, caused climate change! We've bombed countries much, much less! least deserve exactly fascist Japan, Taliban.

not. Partial lockdown started 17 days ago, it’s worth. haven’t seen anyone outside household since pandemic started, aside work. wasn’t sure contact tracing changed what, thought would mean 14 day quarantine isn’t health department recommending.  also watched segment Fauci interview, way interpreted context Q2 Q3 next year, things gradually start returning normality (with masks distancing) able transition full normal subsequent weeks months. Trump tried take credit one yet? Murica really catch much production distribution vaccine billions people takes time.

Just seeing successful trials mean getting month. estimates broad distribution around April, even prioritize gets access first (usually risk group). We'll see extraordinary efforts made worldwide able speed not. We’re 2 2 American pharmaceutical companies. Serious question: virtually pharmaceutical innovations come US companies? feel like 4% population produces 90+% medical innovation. interesting 2-3 weeks ago, seemed like USA relative low cases compared Europe. remember thinking much country probably already Corona seem chill-period summer Europe. last 10 days insane. much cases many people already it.

So yea, lockdowns, least family lives, distancing actually taken seriously.

Not saying strategy better worse, showing I’ve seen two countries different approaches. Russia expects produce primarily freeze-dried Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine doses spring, top official said, eliminating need transport ultra-low temperatures part ambitious plan inoculate population. Vaccine developers globally scrambling work ship store vials, must kept specialised freezers extremely low temperatures. logistical challenge brought sharp focus promising interim trial data vaccine developed BioNTech Pfizer, major breakthrough race curb pandemic. vaccine needs shipped stored minus 70 degrees Celsius, equivalent Antarctic winter, posing challenge even sophisticated hospitals United States.

Whether trucked across Siberia flown far reaches Arctic, vials must stored minus 18 degrees Celsius below, according Gamaleya Institute developed shot. Russia also testing version undergone lyophilisation, turning liquid vaccine dry, white mass stored normal fridge temperatures 2 8 degrees Celsius . Russia previously disclosed many doses freeze-dried vaccine planning produce. Kirill Dmitriev, head Russian Direct Investment Fund , backing marketing vaccine, told Reuters would soon main focus.

""""We conducted trials confirm immune response lyophilised form standard form vaccine. Interim results vaccine liquid form showed shot 92% effective. Lead scientist Gamaleya Institute, Alexander Gintsburg, said interview Reuters earlier year freeze-drying yet primary focus, lyophilisate expensive takes longer produce. Russia plans produce around 2 million doses Sputnik V year, ramping 15 million per month spring.

Contracts seen Reuters state tender register show Gamaleya Institute placed order materials laboratory supplier Dia-M used packaging 2.9 million doses shot liquid form, 720,000 doses freeze-dried. health ministry, supervises Gamaleya Institute, comment contracts. health secretary Brazilian state Bahia told Reuters ruled buying vaccine produced Pfizer BioNTech required ultra-cold freezers transportation. Bahia signed deal Russia 50 million doses Sputnik V September.

Russia alone looking freeze-drying. Japan, Daiichi Sankyo Co making so-called messenger RNA -based candidate hopes give edge storing higher temperatures. late September, Russian authorities ran test supply chain, sending small quantities vaccine liquid form every region country. ""We’re like Spetsnaz world medical distribution."" Outside temperatures also affect long containers able function.

Where's hyperventilation bag? Yeah, right. Wise words. Dude, wish knew.  first person months ago reported serious side effects.

Sign first dose made available me. idiot charge official covid response US government, Fauci, jackass Atlas, told people Michigan ""rise up"" restaurants closed covid running wild.

Do really think said chance becoming true? actually explain problem is, rather insinuating OP wants kill people stupid understand stats?

The data shows 77,300 deaths Nov 6 shows 2020 far normal, 89-92k / year preceding 10 years. support people agree with, surprised enforce rules follow That’s I’ve saying. Lots even net tax payers... Legit. saw article says 2022 yesterday...how point one knows happen happens? Come Canada 🇨🇦 shut NJ literally cannot afford so. help federal goverment. Swede, reading thread painful due huge amount misinformation. F!  According , accumulated excess mortality 2020 Sweden almost 5000 (60,566 total deaths year vs. 55,975 2015-2019).

Wait full-year number. second wave currently growing Sweden might also make things even worse. Yay! amazing take good care 5 mini ones within year. Schools opened late August Indiana live. 3 major hositpals full atm. many give shits. good news learned, healthcare workers going PTSD this. imagine many people died think ""let's try way time"" never ending amount patients.

People need wake up, real. Make anti maskers sign DNR's. Make law, way listen life line. Yeah Pfizer likely going sending doses next month vulnerable (20 million doses = 10 million vaccinated) 25-30 million doses (12.5-15 million vaccinated month) afterwards U.S. Moderna, Astra Zeneca Johnson Johnson different parts final stages, lot scientists think we'll get one/multiple available general public April.  Means there’s going phase 2 term coronababies. 🤔 It’s message leader. It’s surprising all. government lies. surprise. Sweden worse deaths per capita almost countries.

Thats prediction. statement fact.

Saying Sweden bad many countries prediction. correct. Sweden really badly now.

France 6 times Swedens population think want French equivalent Swedens rates multiply 6. Sweden suffering 40 day thats cconservatively French equivalent couple hundred day. checked latest figures daily new cases equivalent almost 30k.

If go back 4 weeks check Frances rates see accurate.

Its actually easy accurate. Swedes dont like basic maths guess. deaths resulting cases reported 2-4 weeks ago, reported cases curve less vertical. (Remember deaths trailing indicator.) 

The deaths weeks Thanksgiving going worse, based recent case reporting, around Christmas deaths worse still, start resulting idiots travel family Thanksgiving dinner.

This year's holiday season one giant super spreader event.

We well truly screwed. live Midwest, relocated DC 5 years. many differences, one things hated difference seeing doctor. practically tell doctor wrong needed fix it, bunch symptoms sure related good luck even getting listen. would go straight urgent care ER talking doctor pointless. stories...

So move back Midwest find doctor first appointment think spent 45 minutes talking. anomaly. last doctor moved would take time explain things, give options, discuss opinions handle symptoms.

The difference medical care Midwest DC stark consistent doctors specialists urgent care. ER would say similar whatever reason.

So feel problem describing actually function doctors themselves, rather administrators financial pressures living high-cost, high-density area doctors nurses even janitors rent cost insurance probably pays here. could wrong. I'm observing patient. Maybe metro area. would consistent experience based complaints. last 5 months since attending COVID meetings. Doctors USA compensated extreme. lawyers suing hospital chains random human accidents. 

In Japan, medicine socialized , fee procedure set medical board year. charge necessary procedures every hospital/physician. accidentally injured , malpractice lawsuits rarely reach 2-3x salary even result death.

Healthcare USA lottery system lawyers. Doctors think decade school deserves chance rich. Doesn’t happen anywhere else world. point pure profit prioritized well employees.

Or patients, complaining decades. long child healthy immune system, risk might still harbor low. Immunity 100% chance re-infection estimated around 0.01% according Qatar study, however aware pediatric specific research area. icu availability; 100% ICU portion considered dead statistically.

so tomorrow's 100k another 1k+ dead.

only 7-10% regular hospital lotentially dead; 35-42% increase outside healthcare. (the can't get access anyways group.)

so... higher 400k. surprised  Dunno break man people allowed quit jobs. people wear masks properly, chins Yeah way anti vaxx people going come ways evade requirements right? /s People really freaking fuck mRNA vaccine degrade faster genetic material we've used before.

The reason safe say 2 months acceptable there's going transcripts lingering around.

ZERO adverse effects 17k vaccinated persons 2 months pretty damn good. Better getting COVID. partner finished residency 4 Corners Medical Center Red Mesa. appreciated time Navajo Nation. wished could visited. Maybe world returns normal... Take care, friend. disagree lived life one utopias reference to.for example UK NHS doctors treated US paid even less.

Socialized Healthcare means government fucks instead corporation without much improvement patient doctor interaction. Read infection law frameworks reasoning. Double may onto something. Socialized medicine could help this. healthcare deemed human right, product, see physicians getting boot large numbers. So... KN95 (real deal), N95, FFP2 derivatives bare minimun now? ^ Nah, saw signs month ago, added little extra next couple shopping trips. bought 2 usual 12 pack toilet papers, extra bigger one, new thing paper towels anyways. also stocked kitty litter. think needing bag kitten food even eating that, I'm pretty sure adult cat is.

I bidet surgery close enough area use wound closes. Last time ended extra TP accident right panic buying hit area (bought without double checking) gave pack someone desperate need. GOVERNMENT don’t give FUCKkkk

Not true. American people give fuck otherwise would voted criminals denying people healthcare human right. look what's table 14 days later: stricter measures. Like said, government needs talk people adults say ""Sorry, need 8 weeks do."" Instead, drag out, little baby steps time. would go full tilt right, could stop little bit here, little bit nonsense. even admitted yet Christmas worst idea. Christmas completely undo trying accomplish therefore totally cancelled. no. right back start shortly Christmas yet another lockdown marking start yet another botched opportunity. know trying fool, policy appeasement works populace, virus. Yeah noble teach, absolutely. Children need dedicated teachers. kids problem. administration, red tape causing overcrowding, decreasing educational standards, parents blame teachers issues (sometimes valid, sure, frequently aren't). According /r/COVID19/comments/jqy0vh/comment/gcaiytx John Hopkins University FAQ, safe people tested positive quarantine together. 

You may reassured know loss smell taste associated milder course disease, people requires hospitalization usually intact smell taste, whereas people loss smell taste generally recovered home. Best luck family. Imminent? yep. thing shut certain warehouses allowed retraining healthcare backend. (different rules; requiring certifications.)

this would free experienced backend aid middle front line would folk capable maintain severity areas..

then over, transition back old jobs. government funded universal heath care must work. Lol love far right immigration talking points! Completely untrue course. Great l, people actually smart enough handle pandemic even *interested* handling pandemic. still toilet paper upcoming year bought back march. Pure stupidity  swallow ""very complicated federal structure"" argument. Germany.

Neither ""we uniquely densely populated"". Belgium isn't. characteristic northern European countries, extremely urbanized compact. Even somewhat low population density numbers (such Sweden) irrelevant since half country like cold Amazon population centers concentrated extent Belgium.

""We hub travel many borders"". No, fact vastly less appealing tourists neighbouring countries, extremely large airport Schiphol, Frankfurt De Gaulle, countries like Switzerland, Austria Czech Republic also many neighbours porous borders.

Finally least convincing all. ""we country culturally reckless People"". hearing people forum saying every country say lockdowns harsh enough. Even extremely orderly places like Austria.

The amount excuses made Belgium since country locked hard absurd. I'm pretty sure use primitive methods like exposing people Covid order test efficiency vaccine, rather, probably something like measure antibodies blood. Ebola relatively easy contain due spread. Ebola mortality rate has, started spreading way COVID, flu cold, we'd fucked. get gov handouts seek profit. America worst systems lol

For covid specifically, arrangement profit consumers, bet govt paying mark-up. Get back shit actually published peer reviewed. trusting companies billions line results. filter exhaust easily superspreader asymptomatic. Oh boy. Sounds like fairy tale  set false premise draw false conclusion it. Corona deaths leading overall societal changes likely result overall less deaths usual.


More working home, less car accidents, etc. 

So again, knowing people died course important since humans want minimize specific causes. 

Simply looking total number deaths per year saying: ""yup, looks right"" tell anything help fix root causes (hence serial killer example ealrier) It’s going free people. government pay it, honestly don’t really care pay $10 billion $30 billion. Wait. saw article hour ago sub claiming 94% get extra .5%? think competent government *not* block purchase huge news Czech Republic, one point 550,000 US equivalent cases one day, new number, dramatic drop 58,497 US equivalent--Excellent, course death rate, lagging indicator, way high, 3038 deaths US equivalent Sunday, drop sharply hopefully coming weeks yet. Results week next  two thousand entire country. (Canada) Check back 23 months. know got placebo vaccine, past certain sample size stats work around things like certain people careful Unfortunately can’t without sort federal stimulus package. States aren’t allowed go debt like federal government cover costs. state state lockdowns, many people would work income. governor (Colorado) best without forcing thousands poverty. federal government needs step fuck up. shit ridiculous. somehow managed connect virus 5G lost me. COVID-19 effectively destroyed simple soap (which case viruses) . regular hand washing achieve results regular changing disposable gloves. think people underestimate long take get something like 80% vaccinated. Hell, anti vaxxers, doubt ever get there. going long one assistance would greatly appreciated. 

As someone tested positive whose stomach churns thought putting everything spouse two weeks; wear mask 24/7 wash hands often, need worried potential spreading virus? 

Obviously social distancing sleeping separate areas time distance concern, times go common areas, time, common area. wearing mask times enacted daily cleaning regiment includes door knobs, light switches, counters. 

Assuming continue plan, would issue dishes, cook dinner, wash clothes, etc. nothing?

Thanks good luck everyone going tough times. What? No, people cautious. Congratulations, dumbest take I’ve heard yet. think safely assume study least single-blind Sure denier.

Comparing like like Sweden excess mortality.

And fall upon us become apparent deniers like you.

Or you’ll find new goal posts.

But here’s facts.

Sweden awfully. lost ton people, economy suffered, still getting massive surge neighbors now.

It didn’t work. Let go fantasy nothing work out. doesn’t work way. hospitals crushed economy.

Just look Sweden States, Florida. Absolutely wrecked economy despite wide open weeks partial shutdown months ago, surging cases.

Your hopes nothing don’t pan out. Maybe Martin Shkreli buy vaccine patent Moderna Pfizer sell $2,000 per dose. FFS alter DNA. explained multiple times. point trolling. candidate sponsored Dr Fauci NIAID.  Im sure price matters. care restarting economy, tax revenue far outweigh costs. Shit, revenue people dying well. 360 million Americans. likely 2 dose vaccine.

They need distribute 650 million doses vaccine end pandemic. 

This real challenge. Thank response! live Delhi. one cares disease longer. 1 dozen coronaviruses battle daily. 

Dengue far dangerous Delhi coronavirus even though coronavirus may spread more.

This temp surge due pollution
By Nov end crop burning end cases fall line rest country.

It's Jan surge dangerous. “In response Rivers’ allegations, University Medical Center told local station KVIA-TV statement although sympathize medical professional, “cannot fully verify events expressed.”

“We empathize sympathize difficult, physical emotional toll pandemic takes thousands healthcare workers throughout country,” statement read.

“This particular travel nurse UMC briefly help El Paso confront surge Covid-19 patients.”

This basically confirmation nurse claims. vaccinate 16% US population 65, deaths crash 70%...i estimate February March achieve this...almost folks... people going upset us still participate. Especially businesses. year's mate  usual, crisis shows us best worst humanity do. Thousands thousands specialists around world working asses face deaths one side, selfish idiots rejecting reality other. hope work schools get quicker general populace father's sake. know true is. 
Australia needs rural GPs dozens, specialists jobs cities much harder come small nitpick: 90/15000 = 0.006 = 0.6%. Agreed. I'm gonna hold bit. I'm also low risk one could be. happened student teaching. went pee classes time ever got reamed lead teacher. incredulous. yelled I’d thing could get sued kid got hurt.  didn’t lock door use bathroom he’s fail me. 

This 2007. God knows regulations now! Absolutely great news. Hopefully risk vaccinated January It’s thought safe works. doesn’t use traditional vector deliver payload. Basically cells become vector. mRNA encapsulated lipid shells fuse cells program cells start producing SARS-Cov-2 spike protein antigen. It’s safe there’s finite amount put body, it’s either absorbed cells annihilated immune system, longer continues spread. rare cases normal vaccines actually cause self replication begin spreading. vaccine might 90% effective watch 50% take :/ without wide uptake keep hygiene part daily life what's more, 35k tests... Market competition good, wait bit get cheaper vaccine even effective jab. It’s matter time.  increased taxes

That capitalism COVID currently ~10 times lethal seasonal flu would reduce 5 times lethal estimates hold. Pfizer: vaccine that's 90% effective.

Moderna: I'm end man's whole career! claimed 90% efficiency 20 infections? Thats 100% relativ error! (as would 2 cases non-placeboo group. 1more/less would 85 95%...) Depends current loan status. paid smaller family, fine. Fresh grads obviously can't make happen. 

I know several doctors retire problem. school 7 plus years. selfish, wear mask protect me. Come people, selfish smart. announcement morning builds previous positive Phase data vaccine candidate showed preventative medication generated neutralizing antibodies immune T-cells target virus causes COVID-19. vaccine provoked cell response within 14 days vaccination antibody response within 28 days, according Oxford University, AstraZeneca’s partner developing vaccine candidate. **It’s believed time vaccine could provide protection novel coronavirus year. Additional protection require booster additional vaccination.**

 Looks like second shot needed 1 year. Plus, works well vaccine candidate AZD1222 showing efficacy older patients, risk COVID-19, AstraZeneca also said adverse events candidate among elderly patients found lower, CNBC reported money store savings bank account literally burning becomes worthless mean year. get thing next fall I’ll surprised. Oops. I’ll fix lol It’s possible it’s unlikely it’s worth considering bot weirdly tuned thing I've ever seen. won’t, many, many die. price still incurred treasury country even free vaccination.  like hoard ventilator, remdesivir PPE beginning pandemic? Tough luck least antivaxxers means vaccines rest us. Yes, encourage elderly get flu vaccine.. oh wait, yes do. 

While post may misinformation per se since yes, true elderly tend build strong immune response young, dangerous thinking vulnerable populations first receive vaccine. Even vaccine 70% effective elderly, 30% get much likely mount robust immune response significantly decrease hospitalizations. numbers made / speculation see effect influenza vaccines - even ultimately catch virus tend much better prognosis not. 

The elderly (75+) healthcare workers first receive vaccine, be. imagine age-banded limits (e.g., 65+ above, 50+ above, general availability) vaccine availability allows.  Vaccines proven work mink strain nearly 95% ready sick backflip joy.

And/or 95% ready party ass (safely) given green light FDA. *Starts researching immigrate New Zealand*  trigger incivility saying make big mac fair, SARS even last coronavirus caused epidemic...between SARS COVID-19, still MERS.  think anyone trying minimize workers going through. White collar jobs like doctors get highlited require years education training, usually requires one take massive student debt; extremely hard replace, losing way scarier.  society without law enforcement look like you?  Lol I'd bet that's price *outside* US. Probably applies EU, UK, NZ AU only. Logistical issues price would bar much Asian countries. US gonna get tangled insurance pocket, co pay shit. Even tablet tylenol could cost $10 dental clinic. needed news today! exciting hear! help Russia also named one Russia Today misinformation offshoots ""Sputnik"". 

Yes know cosmonautical origins. think 2020 bad. wait til 2021...people skeptical wearing masks people get vaccinated. #HoldMyBeer #WatchEverythingDie Even cold weather excelerate COVID, inside snowing will. Outside dining basically impossible areas winter.  True, thought pharma companies got gov handouts? Maybe not. probably stipulation India fucking surprises man. 

Theres widespread non compliance proper mask usage widespread crowding due Diwali.

 numbers falling. ultra stupid part ""wait times"" thing even US usually wait month two get see specialists, too, unless something really time sensitive like cancer, imagine also get back-burnered universal healthcare systems. higher standard expectations! 😄

The vaccine *got* cheap. fact appear normal range prices vaccines worldwide: think ever see normalcy Exactly  Lockdown everything! Wear masks! Shut economy health care! That's Phase III study Feel like less this. start, time vaccine rolled significant proportion society already virus itself. importantly, really need vaccinate segment society vulnerable (e.g., ages 60+ 50+) order drastically reduce overall mortality rate, remove risk hospitals overwhelmed, etc.

I would surprised even need vaccinate 50% population sensibly remove vast majority even restrictions. I'm sorry feel way. reality type thinking ""government right"" always false. Always.

You're living country right (I even care which) government things well. first world country, guarantee government regulation keeping safer without it. Uhhh...they’ve proven work phase 1/2. Phase 3 mostly safety effectiveness data.   competitors 60+ overweight might case.  totally agree majestic piece writing. 

Fwiw I'll thrilled take vaccine. Lombardy first arrived West. 24th February. long year. Yep I'm longer feeling burned getting second wind hope less fortunate individuals cost somehow becomes affordable, others able pay money, myself, small price pay getting world back sense normalcy. going close retail stores Black Friday? 10 billion

That's cost vaccine, landed vaccine company's distribution points. 

The actual cost vaccinate someone logistics delivering period time, losses due folks missing 2nd dose needing remedial dose later incidentals push cost astronomically. though worth it. 

Additionally, amount money solve problems hard. require LOT smart management decide distribution strategy prioritization. What’s different then? put question r/askscience. Hard pass thanks anyway Vaccine 360 again, comment deleted tried say something true.

SMH, go figure. Doctors overpaid system broken. Fix system pay doctors inline get paid Europe/UK. Obviously fix system first. suggest KN95 somehow substitute N95 shortage. not. 

Up 70% genuine KN95s even meet standards, according analysis genuine KN95s obtained healthcare organizations. Many public health agencies officially say KN95s provide level protection surgical masks. lrder change constitution two goverments vote election decisions. Alternativly public vote goverment voted once.  school district announced today middle schools going back 5 days week person classes. Got start now. Nevermind county highest covid numbers state. Go SC! ...since beginning pandemic. stop, head Thank scientists. believing worse flu. shouldn’t individual states. That’s whole point country set up. (Not opinion sayin) Thank part trial!!! Stop watching movies. actually happened reality. much better logistically Pfizer vaccine practical worthless. possible, production get shifted one.

The logistics can’t really overstated. Every company globally closest mass producing distributing vaccine part Operation Warpspeed.  approved, US access Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine doses end 2021? Also saw half assed measures, saw work, people started thinking matter do. super frustrating barely anywhere finally committed they've started roll admit defeat Realistically, see full-scale deployment holidays. probably late US. COVID-fatigue already driving spikes cases across country. start 2-week shelter place New Mexico peaked 1,800 new daily cases last week. start pandemic seeing 200-300 cases daily. holidays change weather, people spending time inside together seeing family traveling. Things pandemic. that's meme heard long time. Want know long term effects?

Wait long time.

As many things life, gambling aspects. Use judgement. Personally, would line first vaccinated. Yes, results dealing virus written though troubles all, “revealing” contraction like game really depends length time next respiratory pandemic/epidemic. 50+ years away locations, count prepared. news coming company, [data safety &amp; monitoring independent body setup National Institutes Health.

This board notified Moderna early results trial, Moderna misrepresented DSMB's feedback DSMB would call it, Moderna's stock would plummet. think ND wins like 70% lol.  Yes since 95% people around would immune, almost nobody 5% infected given time, nearly 100% people encounter virus free.

Still glad got it, I’ll standing line Moderna maybe Pfizer shot soon it’s available me.

No measures beginning. NIH new. president would supported vaccine research. difference administration chosen brand it. even bother. can't change opinion unintelligent people.  Large number Americans decided covid interested hearing anything dangerous is. Nice let anti maskers die first Oh good.

This thing really hard eradicate 😖 buy AliExpress counterfeit catridge Maybe they'll make idk literally saw someone say discouraging holiday get-togethers another way ""they"" trying destroy families. brother degree microbiology (but work field) wife works hospitals lactation consultant/labor &amp; delivery nurse. I've helping kids' remote learning since March they're STILL mad told go state Thanksgiving attend cousin's wedding weekend, I'll need 10 day quarantine get back. would help girls work then?! 

Yeah, cousin getting married, too. fuck that. state awful COVID rates right now, I'm staying home. Bc nature brutal. probably even higher due intentional self unblinding. Folks vaccine arm generally knew gotten instead placebo due side effects, verified gotten via antibody tests. people proceeded take crazy risks.  free US know easy take shots US see something like this, need consider US population 300+ million population NZ 5 million best. like comparing apples kangaroos.  read article, pretty clearly died Covid. read effects vaccines properly kick Summer things relatively normal next Winter.

So could longer would solid act penance decades fucking things unnecessary warfare environmental immaturity. great way take step toward global partner. country from? OHWAHAHAHAH! Yeah, people refuse it, risk we're put under. Great news!!! Especially temperature bit. Wonder it’s different Pfizer Dr's nurses need go strike federal state governments start taking shit seriously.  need find one first! School closures lots negative consequences, especially kids, don’t expect Sweden enact them. fact, countries Europe following Swedish example, keeping schools open, reason. shit needs 6:30pm national news, making blaring siren lost opportunity.  know mentioned El Paso bad, bad, image Slipknot video occurring hospital bad. 😂😂😂 Well that’s fucked haha. whiny babies college saying “feel kinda unsafe pick food cafeteria” need really calm down. don’t know real risk making worse. might shut good. Fines maaaaaybe?

Prison times? Unless someones something fucking crazy, no. risks vaccine causing Guillain-Barré vaccine make immune system attack nerves cases paralyze years later? happened last time US fast tracked flu vaccination. forgot part Godzilla comes pacific tsunamis kills 100 million.  I'm point ignoring COVID good reason cut someone voting Trump was. shows willfully ignorant, selfish, value life all. people want friends with. They're claiming efficacy preventing Covid-19 disease, avoiding infection. standard practice vaccines.   Hope trial went effective enough. anyone wanting know double blind clinical test went through. placebo I'll give bit info. 

First given nose swab blood taken, first booster shot. week measure redness injection site, take temperature feel glands arm swolleness use app called patient cloud. would weekly calls next month would booster.

All set monthly update call next time blood test. Ah forgot booster arm sore week. Sweden lack legislation enable government restrict movement way many countries done mostly government screaming stay fuck home idiots hope we'll listen.

Interesting. mechanism government pass temporary emergency legislation help maintain public order pandemic? due splintered nature Swedish political parties difficulties makinng major changes minority goverments like countries? take three vaccines? allowed? thanks. I’m 14 mental health drain. feel like I’m running time enjoy life, ~1 year~ life taken away draining. 

I’m obviously still taking every precaution, family we’ve seen grandmother (Masked, distanced outside), can’t wait day crap ends  tag name u/bronet like advocate herd immunity strategy theories. case. Feel free debunk conflicts rather broadcast opinion fact, though. why, think were. I'm generally baseless conspiracy theories, I'm glad we're Swede best access resources topic, neglect elaborate resources communicating rest world. Instead blame ""international press"" tarnishing country's reputation, controversial actions/statements taken must understand frustrating Swedish press manages stay pretty objective. seen heard articles supporting crowds, without taking stance themselves. obviously hard though, comes subjects are, stupid reasons, sensitive. guess that, think it, reddit acts like another filter sense. International media tends ""SWEDEN USED HERD IMMUNITY"" approach. posters here. many articles seen say opposite? often posters every time well.

I blame anyone tarnishing anything though. think people deserve know actual blame shared. Sweden FHM share successes failures take responsibility for. Swedish media, job, allow us wear thin, poor fitting, cheaply made mask company logo it. We're allowed wear N95, surgical, etc. else get fired. see connection.

For many people, Thanksgiving once-a-year chance see relatives, many aging, sorts emotional resonance. Canceling Thanksgiving *lot* harder wearing mask many people.

That said, right thing do. please think canceling Thanksgiving trivial thing everyone.  complicated that. 

There risk mutation every time virus infects new host. virus mutates transmissible form one mutations, new version gradually come dominate whether contain virus. 

The virus likely mutate given host host gives access fewer potential new hosts. viruses mutations are, essentially, completely agnostic host's behavior. 

If take mitigation measures stop pre-mutation version virus, randomly mutates form gets around mitigations, new strain rapid come predominate - we're *less* likely see new mutation give virus fewer opportunities mutate stopping access many hosts. 

The worst possible thing risk-of-dangerous-mutation standpoint feeding virus hosts. 🤔 tests positive... really it.  Ofc, 42 people less.

But limiting gatherings lockdown sweden lockdown since march since gatherings limited 50 people. past Friday, brother spent time friends, one got Covid test next day, got positive result Sunday. saw brother Sunday hour two, unmasked indoors sitting particularly close other, friend let know positive test. friend asymptomatic thus far, brother get test Tuesday.

My quick internet research makes think brother probably friend enough virus test positive next day, probably far enough incubation period pass along me. fair assessment? obviously either way plan staying home foreseeable future. Moderna Pfizer:

FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT Please go believing best years. resenting missing partying etc: *trust me*, well late twenties mid thirties - beyond even. Sucks though, sympathise. Nah would probably supply side jesus bull neo liberals always harping about, something something yacht industry employs skilled workers expansion industry employ people broaden tax base tax cuts increase revenue. stupid question, say vast quantities multiple vaccines available general distribution public, could person take one increase overall efficacy contracting covid? target receptors theses vaccines similar see small incremental increases efficacy taking multiple vaccines?  technically tho. Ireland, Finland, Norway currently keeping case numbers well controlled also. Germany's recent lockdown probably yield decent results least short-term too, locked earlier autumn. first year I’ve ever gotten one, expected sort reaction. totally fine. flu shot live attenuated. nasal flu vaccine is. majority people get shot. wouldn’t worry shutdown people wore masks, practiced social distancing...can’t blame anyone Oh God think conspiracy theories arise decision....

So much I'd avoid even costs more. need everyone take severely curtail spread, though. Get ready conspiracy nut jobs anti-vaxxers, thats next wave crazy. Maybe borders one country without preliminary vaccination won’t open one country early access vaccines that’s you’re saying that’s issue would span far greater 2021 I’ve told placebo saline solution. Salt water would give headache &amp; fever. “Experts” tend think otherwise. Antibody test able confirm. $50 without insurance Labcorp... look it! maybe she’s trying needs done slow spread. It’s fault people selfish ignorant wear mask know, that's find odd often family members die, even young, families get one bats eye.

I wish could figure out. 100% flu patients develop symptoms? Since when?

Maybe 100%, much higher understand study testing correlation vaccine developing symptoms?

Not according Moderna. listed primary purpose demonstrate efficacy mRNA-1273 COVID-19.

Nothing correlation vaccine symptoms. literally testing see prevent Covid altogether.

So think claiming data say claiming have. Uh, tagged good news? Anti-vaxxers going see title read article going encourage get vaccinated. ignorant fact grocery store/convenience stores/Walmart/Target NEVER closed single day, even once? completely understand! live Alabama people say words exactly become bit peeve mine. Again, sorry jackass  huge chunks northwest, Canadian/US border population density like 2 people per square mile. still got buffalo there. yet. done 3 months ago. Well, things sure.. forever wash hands often. Get flu shot every year. probably wear mask around others public. 

I sick since covid got started. nice. first all, i’m relying randoms internet thinks entry level employees confront anti maskers judge reliability arguments. 

second all, cashier/store associate/retail common job young adults. 

third all, you’re picking small parts argument ignoring provided source asked know you’re wrong. 

most entry level employees told confront people don’t listen rules risk personal safety. you’re ignorant. don’t go stores stand day confront everyone. since you’re sure there’s risk personal safety. worries. stuff order Amazon. can’t imagine pandemic without them. Imagine way. really don’t see difference limiting crowds 50 people limiting crowds 8? think it’s feel sense glee. happening? This. People understand this. majority posts even posted Kiwis. articles written NZ outlets inform NZers. NZer, like keep number cases country. one asking random American post articles here. notion NZers collectively bragging success rubbish It’s fast moving virus, fast enough infect 300m people reasonable amount time, we’re geographically distant, travels fast do, days lag inbetween jumping hosts.

Like, truly uncontrolled exponential growth could get really bad really fast, (arguably we’re already there) can’t envision scenario allow case load get even past 1m cases day, even wouldn’t fast enough ensure type herd immunity unfortunately. 

A question asking though actual peak? many cases/deaths day enough finally get us take seriously act country combat it. think suggesting along lines Chris Rock joke. Funding Covid-19 vaccines supposed do. want - cookie? agree. don’t want see anyone lose jobs make feel better, feel like US gets dragged mud worst worst, anti mask idiots, on. reality virus running ramped many parts world badly worse. That's statistics work. 0.03% odds 0%. still happen. lot countries poorer countries South America. 

Swedes kinda painfully arrogant something really ashamed ticks lot people off. Get humility. believe you, cmp. I'm skeptical coworker PhD candidates physics usually work outside university. Mostly high workload also majority good US university programs explicitly bar physics PhD students picking outside work. paid department via fellowship. 

Additionally, one gets PhD quantum mechanics. Almost every physicist uses lot quantum mechanics can't say I've heard grad student explicitly working adding QM theory. That's good way spend rest life writing thesis, especially got job side. Wow timing kawinkidink crazy! Science amazing. supply deals entirety 2021 IIRC. Getting doses March rather August would hugely worth price difference poorest countries. made plans thanksgiving set indoor/outdoor space keep physically distant lots safety measures. would safe family members decided didn’t want it. 

Some may fear virus mostly think seemed like much trouble wouldn’t fun compared normal thanksgiving. 

Like everything else pandemic it’s fucking depressing. 

If weather isn’t bad might still try get people back yard hang out. Well family cower home indefinitely rest us get life.

In area, 100% deaths thing (still 20 per day province nearly 15 million people) outbreaks long-term care homes. Vaccinate residents staff places, along elderly immunocompromised community, would probably deaths.

Everything else could open could burn masks point. It’s double blind study. I’m San Antonio, TX. Things calm fully expect explode like pretty much rest country soon. feel like US stepped paid vaccines poorer countries around world, post said could easily afford, would great thing do, might restore little respect us.  next administration know they’re Oh know. It’s really really hard separate run massive misinformation campaign. 

He severed trust White House don’t think put trust government able look them
To get decent guidance. 

But supporting Fauci pulling WHO. It’s hard believe anything could remotely good endorsing anything automatically taints it. 

So I’m cautiously optimistic vaccines. I’m hoping everything works out.  one hand, think anyone getting extra special treatment. hand, situation like this, really need one doctors prolonged period grieving wife dies? seems like simple step everyone take minimal drawbacks. Living northern hemisphere, started taking supplementary Vitamin weeks back reports shows sort correlation. 

We already know we're lacking Vitamin winter long we're overdosing seems reason take it. one big flaw see borders probably won’t open risk folks vaccinated. Like doubt country going welcome bunch potentially infected people without mandatory quarantine risk covered. I’m guessing.  Vaccines already production, time. waiting approval. Expect applications go next week, quick approval likely days that. comment make sense, fact America's complete total failure get control virus might lead much quicker results ultimately benefit entire world definition silver lining. Since new mRNA vaccine causes cells make pieces virus, immune system learns target those—is concern immune system could mistakenly learn target cell instead virus pieces? sense could autoimmune disease considered risk mRNA vaccine? happening expected place next kindly ask Coronavirus take break cogs bureaucracy turn pace. actively working learn whole range short- long-term health effects associated COVID-19. pandemic unfolds, learning many organs besides lungs affected COVID-19 many ways infection affect someone’s persons COVID-19 recover return normal health, patients symptoms last weeks even months recovery acute illness. Even people hospitalized mild illness experience persistent late symptoms. Multi-year studies underway investigate.

CDC continue active investigation provide updates new data emerge, inform COVID-19 clinical care well public health response COVID-19.

Estimates right ~10% infected experience longer term symptoms even stop testing positive. much know scary much know, pretty irresponsible suggest people young + healthy = sick/asymptomatic weeks that's it. needs rebranded national security issue. COVID-19 took USS Roosevelt reducing ability recruit new soldiers.

That homeless guy vaccinated COVID-19 putting nation's security risk. military necessity vaccinated public expense. completely underestimating little USA cares covid newer vaccines work immunocompromised/suppressed people? understand patients receive 'inactive' vaccines sure types vaccines newer ones are. UK going do, accepted herd immunity approach. mistaken? Yeah pretty depressing. Atleast Sweden kinda excuse fact supposed educated subject atleast?

I mean still doesnt justify actions slightest may explain people listned. vaccines get approved soon? u/tb0x didn’t even think getting antibody test. I’m participating trial week thanksgiving hated would idea got placebo not. also, would placebo patients really develop symptoms? really hard say, even among experts. People saying we're 20 years away past 50 years. I'm honestly hopeful reason, worry, fission proven technology scale up, renewables rapidly coming price. Side effects mild. Pain injection site, fatigue, low fever, example.

Long term effects unlikely pop up. spike protein vaccines targeting specific coronavirus vaccine unlikely behave unpredictably. Many people already vaccine months shown serious side effects. complications vaccine would pop early on.

Trust science. Trust data. Trust evidence. Phillipsburg across border New Jersey, yes close. ""We're gonna wear masks social distance winter, vaccine basically already.""

Also: ""Nah gonna take vaccine""

Reminds America weaponized individualism. viruses mutate quickly method work. is, work. Tons money poured researching diseases mentioned. reason diseases ""cured"" difficult treat even decades research arrived effective therapies.

For example, several antibody based drugs Alzheimer's disease reached phase III trials recent years failed due lack efficacy. development effective treatment Alzheimer's would hugely profitable, barriers economical, scientific. 

A better example would disease affects developing countries malaria. lot interest industry developing therapies since profitable. I'm taking hat trick, safe. Especially thinking he's immune superman Would good publicity hot dog cart potentially help sales line products? even conducted cost benefit analysis yet hot dog cart, multi billion dollar pharmaceutical company?

It them, decide giving vaccine away free worth it. Many companies said make profit vaccine. seems like poor business strategy gotta know they’re doing. level hit herd Immunity vaccination depends effectiveness vaccine. 90+% need many people take vaccine would ""only"" delivered 60%. That's results good news. high effectiveness also enough overcome lot object flu vaccine due fact partly effective - benefits one pretty unquestionable. It’s absolutely amazing least 2 vaccines available first doses like month 90% effective. know nothing sure yet, fact really didn’t start researching vaccine March incredible. amazing achievement. able pull off, would literally one humanity’s greatest accomplishments. Gives lot hope species able accomplish future. put minds (and money) problem species, isn’t much can’t Also “fear mongering” say Thanks. (whimper) need of. enough credit given people stay home. They're ones actually following science putting effort avoid spread.

Their struggle understated either. many dummies party break social distancing get infected spread it, we're stuck home lonely missing dealing lot psychological shit isolation FOMO. Buy stocks therapists, cuz guarantee demand skyrocket over.

But stay strong, friends. vaccine close now. 50 years, wanna able tell kids grandkids one people world actually succeeded infecting anyone?

When feel tempted go out, remember could still brag. feel like absolute boss ;) really wonder much would help country would go full remote schools winter. I'm lot better position service job living situation, live young nephew father teacher, I'm already third COVID scare (twice due nephew's school, due father's) Mid-November. going long winter rate. I'm sick tell boss every second third week needs prepared work might told quarantine two weeks moment's notice. Sorry, needed rant little. Villages isn’t citadel fragility view be. old coots hardier cockroaches party like college kids. don’t think it’s fair compare average senior citizen. Ok run tests samples 3 years ago control. 

They found believe cross reactive coronavirus antibodies blood bank samples 2012 believe. TWIV whole segment 2 weeks row. Saints won, baby! example happend Northern Territory (Directly north South Australia) [immediately sealed Anyone arrived plane given opportunity fly back go two week quarantine. generally costs $2500, people unaware, government paid people chose option. People leaving SA told situation could decide wanted travel.

It immediate responses necessary contain virus. Hopefully existing people traced virus isolated. vaccines best work hit herd immunity levels. Otherwise still going get hotspots.

People realize masks distancing going needed 2021 least, even slacking things like small gatherings everyone vaccinated. 

But fully expect lot people lie vaccinated travel skip wearing mask. thought one point... even worse, estimated around 7000 healthcare professionals globally died due Covid. Even loose average 5 years schooling each.... 35,000 years education. people argue driving car risk Covid, need open sake economy.... lost people gave lives already incalculable can't imagine healthcare worker looking around see little people care, horrifying many died many people said basically value done. heartbreaking. This, exactly. well put. thanks input extremes.. 

nothing dead.

&amp;#x200B;

i'd imagine everything table. cowards, every single one curb supply doctors good times keep salary artificially high
and hard times needed, going country houses ride reason healthcare cost high artificial restriction supply have. u really think people basic job primary care physician? think last interactions doctor, job seem difficult you?


As resident physician working COVID patients ICU: wow, wow. fucking audacity. I’ve cared prayed Skype/FaceTime people died COVID. I’ve working 90 hour weeks $53K/yr taking care patients. 

I’ve staring $387K school debt wondering I’ll continue abused corporate healthcare admins. 

But I’m glad think we’re cowards. think primary care easy? don’t then? courageous enough talk shit comfort home. Come shadow ICU one day, tough guy. Mine job thing lmao 😭 China reenter frozen food before. protein shell freezes without breaking last indefinitely. One extra case matter US Europe, would major headache China/NZ/Australia. Maybe affect performance? fine till parents need work shitty essential jobs like cashier big grocery store two kids need taken care of. handle science without govt support? Bad Bot. Yep, think we've maybe caught one fever them. basically came send home count attendance wise. Corporate attendance policies fucked. thanks input mean, people time anyways they? ""Stay away cold"" etc. Herd immunity like 70% population  That's right guess ;D Praised holy polls! necessarily true Oh 😞 feel like scientists still know full impact virus.
In case reinfected, really free covid infection 1? probably lot learn time will. hope able reduce a.nd soon eliminate covid. article said found true remains men aged 20 87. million dollar observation. something FB causes people go wrong thought highway. Exactly! Nurses working 36 hours shift. know kind dumb mistakes make I'm mildly sleep deprived. going way beyond ""grandma deaths."" town already experiencing longer times ambulance due short staff. I'm limiting driving, extra careful around horses etc. Yea, might still get bed, I'm willing risk getting care extremely overworked health care staff help it. they'd put wrong place.

/smh casinos ? bought Whole Foods spread organic food masses. hail. voted legalize. im totally sick shit. hes mini mitch mcconnell  see something can't compare groups 10-20 people dinner hundreds partying together. Men take seriously. comment stuck Subterranean Homesick Blues head reason. Yes have! Give time, feel annoyance symptoms Cannot even imagine stress doctors nurses going right now. celebrate Veterans day deservedly so. think need acknowledge healthcare workers similar fashion. Start 'National mask' day followed 'Thank doctor/nurse' day. 'Fucking listen saying' day 365 consecutive days.  They’re usually older probably already procreated. Darwin awards unfortunately. headline like one usually make sarcastic comment like, ""I guess exponential growth wasnt hoax all"" frustration everyone around isnt taking situation seriously. dont feel like today.  headline depressing need hope. song Ive hearing Let representatives know support measures, sure hell hearing support it. Bezos one rolling pandemic profits. It’s difficult balancing act needs students, particularly younger ones, chance spread virus. No, sounds interesting. downloading now. sure downvoted it’s probably biggest reasons physicians leaving. system broken screwed. Reported trolling. Yesterday main day Diwali, add list! I'm surprised took long start seeing that.

I'm worker, working company told us needed work 10 hour days six days week six months deliver contract signed.

About 100 employees started project. left 5 weeks getting another job. Nobody knew stayed finish project think ever actually got finished. Nah, Dems took control state supreme court last week that’s she’s this. Maybe federal route would work that’s, surprisingly, willing let states please. Yeah, families see every day. still lot travel mixing households. “Just” two?? 9/11 huge amount deaths one scariest moments modern US history Thing is, don’t even need go concerts parties yet. wanna able hang small group friends without fear bringing home deadly virus. referring hospitalization rate much higher death rate? focus that? talking about? Florida bonkers … see every day. doctors hospital used work going two day strike next week lack PPE. laid May, considered lucky since PPE us coming back maternity leave mess. Lack political support highest levels govt.

Lack funding critical supplies

People care Im old, may remember song, buts it’s band called Silk. “Freak me” there’s lyric say “lemme lick down, till say stop...” haha! First thing thought of... think there's direct connection drug addiction (including alcohol) Covid denial (as well susceptibility fake news like FOX OANN, etc...). aren’t bubble... 2nd/3rd wave. Yet football.  Welcome. Anything us help welcomed..as long isn’t something weird like injecting bleach!  Unfortunately point deniers need see collapse Healthcare system regions believe seriousness situation. hospitals handle current situation situation bad, always scale little right? Right? :( They'll wondering ambulance takes 2 hours pick get car accident way home. I'm sorry people really surprised case? sub rife denying damage long covid. Whenever long covid brought sub past there's several users says big deal happens small percentage people anxiety yada yada

Shame denying this. got whole country beat numbers Texas. That's exactly happened state. Covid infections hand, Hospitals full, 1700 deaths due Covid, governor got pissed enacted shut downs starting Monday. dumb fuckers can't stand staying away other.  Even back March began, I'd see groups people hanging parking lots, nothing ever done it.

Im beginning feel like majority people actually Want Apocalypse real thing. I’m occupational therapist nursing home, I’m burnt out. Every week seems getting worse. can’t take another year this. honesty mind social distancing wearing mask, want able go stuff I'm really hoping let us little lenient comes going out. Wtf man straight good time shit anymore. “Genius”. smart things complete imbecile others. wonder insurance companies don’t implement rule allows refuse paying COVID related expenses people follow mask distancing rules. hope people still wear masks sick. Japan super low flu death rate example even huge elderly population. I've seen people line free food church used attend. food church received either short-dated, date, perishable. people took said thank you. I'm living extreme fear lmao. I'm still going work every day, wife goes school every day, go eat travel. 

We masks watch large crowds. problem yet. wear mask get tested least monthly, weather easily say problem deal hope south korea, everything get back control now. see happens, look almost every western country. sir/madam wrote excellent explanation pleasure read, thank you.  They’re not. small businesses failing big businesses booming. live regional town QLD, Australia 20 cases overall since start pandemic.

Our retailers forced customer limits adjusted time..... fuck wrong US. Clearly value health population  zero. Nah, past year. Doesn’t dramatic. unable stay subject? talking daily case numbers know what? Keep that. everyone sub, keep living extreme fear, logic. Thats difference anecdotal science, I've done much illustrate differences you, rest you. let's refrain making statistics cause there's enough bad info already. people can't trusted right thing, there's choice this. hope states follow suit.  Yep hang there, started sports us - volleyball track far. 2 volleyball kids tested positive first week half. School thankfully still virtual though. We're ""on track"" return come back christmas, numbers state see can. detected sewage samples Spain dating back March 2019? virus seems get interesting   400k total cases occurred 7/24 /u/blazingsaint saying since summer lol likely harming future human race saving people. basically, wants supposed group patriots become special little snowflakes think get live public health because???

I mean point, either following guidelines/trying make sound decisions choices.... aren’t. know I’m want dumb, go ahead. proven wrong...

They confirmed lol Thats kind absurd reasoning makes people distrust experts first place. understand us trying technically accurate keep telling people even vaccine going end crisis, going say fuck it. way home work still see people bars restaurants. dined one since March. Honestly allow outdoor seating take out. People sitting building--even they're 6 feet apart--is asking infections. air circulating around hour takes finish meal, there's going time something land you. sickening EMS getting ass kicked right now. appreciate guys do. paid per diem usually hourly rate. lot schools pay subs minimum wage call school hours 7 hours (subs get paid prep paid lunch either) yeah minimum wage, $40 right day. course, ask come early stay late duties ""it's kids"". ever paid $70 day. next wave. everyone MN triggered governor telling holiday gatherings bad idea. 
 
Nobody know MN triggered, agree point pure profit prioritized well employees.

Are US? so, new here? not. work homeless shelter. people tested positive 3 times 8 months. Still, cases rise nationwide, Illinois one robust testing programs. new cases confirmed among record-high 106,540 tests submitted Illinois Department Public Health, raising average statewide testing positivity rate past week 13.2%. number almost tripled last month, suggesting virus spreading rampantly since mid-May.

13.2% positivity rate testing engender great deal confidence get control without strong actions. 

Especially Thanksgiving days away.  contact tracing analysis tied cases schools?

With said, alarm bells gently ringing head I’m reading that. Again, can’t say he’s definitively wrong without seeing kinds claims he’s actually making, eyebrows slightly raised.

The “this end July SARS ended July” facially ridiculous, though. Comrade care. Cuz everyone needs comrade lean sometimes. Wish 2020 would end already. “...Since quantified virus isolates 2019-nCoV currently available, assays designed detection 2019-nCoV RNA tested characterized stocks vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene...”

When actually virus isolated? someone ELI5 vaccine created one doesn’t even contagion isolated? actually good thing, guess. least doctors left over. ^(/s)

I've saying since beginning, right safe work environment humane treatment. I'm surprised doctors start leaving sooner. Like ""You want wear garbage bag?""

Absolutely not, consistent different policies applied different capacity early policy testing travelers consistent low number confirmed Europe/US cases time

America adopted policies 80s. time, regular guy could get high school, go work factory, support stay-at-home wife family, send kids university, pay house, retire.

Now two parents working get that.

What happened? Simple! 0.1% looted US economy.  huge amount extra value created thanks Hayek Friedman, put value pockets.

Worse, poorest 80% Americans lost something priceless - security. Hayek Friedman consider job security _negative_ value, even though you, person losing job perhaps everything, job security great value.

The rich sloughed huge amount risk used bear - easily able bear - onto rest us. get $1,000,000 medical bill lose job doctor treating pandemic profitable, individuals find crushing.

40 years Hayek Friedman American ropes. think bad, going lot worse two months now.

Cops stores official paid overtime. Precincts bulletin boards officers pick extra hours client pays for.

Anyone picking mask duty would naturally supportive job. Oh, agree go work, lot workers opportunity. wasn’t literal post. making light US covid policy infection rates.   Well that’s totally unethical, surely conspiracy morons would outraged poor people would baited getting vaccine whether wanted not? That's really sad. Ok, *understand* reasoning. 
I agree it, reasonable. lot spread coming private gatherings, seems case, restrictions help much spring summer. think people still care much whether right legal. could wrong. Maybe we'll find soon.

I think restaurants need stop dine bars need close down. prime spreading events across board. people working establishments make enough money risk time. least public situations people theoretically properly distanced masked 100% time. Luckily virus far less harmful children. 0-10 still accounts less 0.1% deaths. Meanwhile schools closed. answer question. Same. Every time extended family guilt-tripped parents grandmother attending event (which they've refusing attend), they've assured they'll sorts safety measures. Masks, social distancing, separate tables, open windows, blah blah blah. lies. 

The masks minutes they're forgotten about. food that's supposed served 1 masked person mobbed crowd maskless covid zombies, buffet style. separate tables there.

Super-high risk family members, friends, significant others, etc supposed present show up.

The open windows immediately closed people chilly. event that's supposed outdoors migrates indoors.

Yeah, families like extended family, hopeless.

I visiting nobody. I'm trying get relatives back current round guilt-tripping grandma. Ugh. Better people die give thousand dollars month? would touchdown happen whole team field? I’m also weighing benefits well socialized dog opposed reactive, anxious one. Like said wear mask keep distance owner No, mainly spread droplet transmission (relatively heavy water droplets breathe out, fall ground 6ish feet away you), sometimes spread airborne pathogen (meaning spreads small particles breathe stay suspended air)

On blood-borne droplet airborne check google search trends location? township butts Philadelphia, boundary also county line believe.

I'm hoping township least something, county. larger metro areas everywhere, really needs coordinated effort city proper surrounding areas. Oh, fuck fucking shingles right fucking fuckhole. shit nightmare plate fucking horror show gravy top pile nightmare shit biscuits. 

I spent two weeks wishing would die, another terrified wouldn’t. took another four weeks neuralgia gone. never horrifyingly tortured life. Middle-class workers NYC take train NJ; much state covered sprawling suburban towns gaps them. One thing adore living NJ little culture pockets (hoping outlast pandemic). 

If lived *maybe* 20 minutes north would consider heading city commutable distance, though still considered maps part greater metro area. learned something Spanish Flu, eh? like people bled b-holes 2 hours dropped dead everyone would bunkered up. find hard believe order groceries via home delivery 94% (!!!!) higher chance getting virus.The difference absurd.This whole study looks pretty questionable me. Call crazy. remind couple months, predict Novavax 97%+ effective vaccine.

Moderna’s vaccine 4x amount measured antibodies, Novavax, remember correctly, 6x. Given bad things already, December going horror story. look future effect (or lack thereof) fertility/birth defects? biggest fear. trying get info debate. Well 95% effective enough convince go get nothing will. People keep waiting 99.999% though. bad virus had? know cases milder symptoms less likely result myocarditis? just....don't try keep distance dogs. It'll late. Enough people already taught believe hoax: doubtful anything would effective outside vaccine. 

In case, Biden likely follow Obama's policy Appeasement towards Republicans it'd surprising even attempts something significant. go lockdown, I’ll play Red Dead Redemption fourth time. Maybe make retropie kids. fact United States designed handle national response fit useless “us/them” narrative?

This United States legally set up. 

Any “national response” inherently illegal require changes laws Constitution want make trust changes used abuse times. Okay mean end it? Eradicate completely? Eradicate mostly? go back normal life?  Also serious case 5% vaccinated cases. (As opposed 11 serious cases placebo) means vaccine provides help even prevent infection. Cool see 5 months 🙄 Reuters much accessible article this, unfortunately moderators think repost instead valuable non-jargon write mere mortals easily grasp. shame important, get much traction. summer like Florida heart kidneys replaced someone else's artificial/cybernetic kidneys care. brain would another matter. brain replaced would likely need replaced piecemeal. really go doctor lungs feel like that. sounds really bad.

BLM protests pointing riots. MLK
Method best one. Yeah kinda wish they'd stop whole ""COVID fatigue"" narrative. feel like harm good get Idiocracy explain screwed state we're in. I'm sure position make judgment. bring table? American biscuits hear much about? Yes, harm reduction steps must also emphasized, people simply change plans. said, experience, harm mitigation steps completely window event actually begins.

I'm much zero-risk camp, go anywhere anything unless humans present all. parents still go stores whatnot, social functions. months back (during local lull cases), months peer pressure relatives, finally goaded attending dinner extended family receiving assurances sorts safety protocols going followed.

It lies. showed restaurant (which supposed 100% extended family) sorts people there.

They told family unit would separate socially distanced tables. Nope, one big table people seated right next across other.

I would noped fast, family uncomfortably huddled corner away everybody else, left early.

Similarly, grandmother intensely socially distancing since began taking seriously. 80s, can't get thing. lonely, would normally meet family almost every day. family heinously irresponsible lax; meanwhile never stop trying get meet them. work every week.

She finally guilt tripped attending cousin's dumb-ass engagement party wedding that's still years away. assured everybody would socially distanced, wearing masks, windows would open, one person would serve food. Nope. lies. Almost nobody wore masks, everybody mobbed hors d'oeuvre finger foods (!!) buffet style dinner, nobody observing social distancing. grandmother went outdoors sad ignored.

**TL;DR:**

I know WTF wrong people. love relatives, grandmother immediate family aside, they've given up.

They best intentions safety measures starts, forget moment event begins rhythm normal-seeming family get together sets in. anti-vaxxer change mind this. 

There anti-vaxxer get vaccination circumstances - believe vaccinations inherently dangerous. 

What need worry fact people don’t care virus, hard get take time day go get shot simply worried virus. look numbers believe completely fine become infected. cross-reactive antibodies found much frequently blood samples taken children aged 6 16.

This age range interesting similarity immunity coronaviruses derived dromedary camel calves (major reservoir host MERS-CoV animal source MERS infection humans) mother's milk.

There exists stability MERS-CoV (unpasteurized) dromedary camel milk, goat milk, cow milk. immunity passed camel calves disappears course 1-year post parturition. coronavirus behaves others, camel milk cure prevent spread SARS-CoV-19? guilt trips woman pulls things unbelievable point power really gone Newsome’s head. may follow science logic especially dinner multiple households, private businesses remain open, children remain school got waiver. 

My Northern California county got moved back purple tier today nursing home outbreak northernmost city county. whole county it’s small businesses suffer small outbreak nursing home that’s close major areas county?

And cases tied small private gatherings like heard weeks now, close businesses all? Let continue run restrictions protocols place months. think people choice go work ignore might get sick. way average person treated government something fault criminal, opinion. Dude, death rate would instead dying slowly peoples heads would explode would arguing staying home.

People emotional entirely subjective. fact virus ""flue-like"" makes much dangerous society. Oh, rapid test? Yeah nvm. things aren’t accurate. apparently take everyone else's chances too.

Dumb fuck.  great news, doubt people understand mean, ie. *what effective at*?

What reduce 95%? Chance infection? chance symptoms? chance severe symptoms/death? these, which? Thank you, Dear Leader, timely vaccines allow loved ones give fuck we'll infect. increasing much lower slope infection rate.

It lags behind infections 3 weeks. live coverage inside covid hospital wards would probably help. found two recent episodes Good Doctor helpful, despite fiction, portrayed familiar characters coping covid. People severe side effects this. 1/1M 1/10M adverse side effects *any* medication horrible. rarely find trials. Read fine print anything medicine cabinet. 

So need ready headline “person dies Covid vaccine” panic. vaccinate billion, you’ll see 1/1M side effects many times. It’s expected. hope extreme effects, shouldn’t expect it. Safety trials &lt;100k people. 

Antivaxxers try use instance adverse effects argue vaccines dangerous. Don’t fall it. Honestly, don’t know, know health issues said lungs feel like filled concrete. Guys, really take advice virus radiologist political agenda. 

That stupid immunologist know he's talking about. /s seriousness, wonder without support Federal Government expansion testing capacity, US capacity test enough get 1mil cases day.

Pretty much no. [Johns Hopkins tracks daily testing currently US little 1.6 million tests day, 10% positivity rate. assuming positivity rate stayed 10%, million cases day would require 10 million tests, 6x increase tests per day. Assuming much higher positivity rate, due focused testing, still need 2-3x current number daily tests. AFAIK can't crank testing quickly, looks like graph able double every months. see way older people even elderly blatantly violating covid restrictions stores see 18-22 year olds. Right 😅 anti-vaxx acquaintances... I’m strong advocate vaccines, generally see anti-vaxxers uneducated fear-mongered thinking they’re best thing families. actions dangerous harmful don’t think world would better died... Let’s clear this. White House office. staffed elected people. Currently head person Trump. basis Trump justifying herd immunity? VAST majority medical professionals saying herd immunity (even it’s possible achieve) take terrible toll excess deaths.

Sweden went herd immunity, backfired. last count 15% population antibodies cases skyrocketing. They’re enforcing restrictions slow spread hospital system stretched. wrong. Herd immunity viable strategy. US hospitals healthcare workers cannot cope what’s happening right now. next weeks going heartbreaking. many people dying.

Apologies going way asked question makes feel need spell out. White House listening medical experts. cherry-picking words field science suits insufficient knowledge tie together. words sound fancy logic behind missing. You’ve bamboozled. Listen Fauci. He’s doctor immunologist. orange one plays golf lot knows TV inherit large amount money turn smaller amount money. knows nothing infectious disease. Fauci does.

I’m asking whether could actually sinus issues. don't. flu vaccine ineffective enough people take vaccine. much lower necessary vaccine. optimistic, yes, flu vaccine. Also, lots problems flu vaccine distribution. places receiving wrong strain, receiving shipments late.

Magnify logistical issues several times since we'll need far 150 million looks like person need two shots Pfizer.

The country setup it. though. right considerations infrastructure planning. county populous state, 250k people 65/100k. 23 counties higher rate state. worst county double mine. chose use Habitat Humanity example guess what? highly selective help. Americans cared helping people would solve homelessness crisis government intervention yet many, many awful charities help LGBT people ones lie women desperate need medical services. Lots charities actively harmful humans. get lumped statistic ""Look giving Americans are! #1 world!"" bullshit statistic. developed countries people going bankrupt medical bills. People beg GoFundMe hope pretty enough engaging enough story gets picked news order avoid ending streets. disgusting put people situation. 

The fact many charities exist first place shows care fellow human beings. 

""Universal healthcare good thing, taxes would go matter there's really caring virtue there"" 

Uh.... yes is. countries said human beings, existing, matter enough basic level care. American's care fellow human even allow that. Immunity mean catch it. caught virus months ago mean force field around stops covid coming in, still get covid, body better trained fighting off.

I'm sure tests someone tested daily takes body immune completely kill virus two days, imagine still window test positive.

In homeless shelter people get tested often they're close contact one gets everyone else needs test. get tested often likely get test within window it. I'm liar, are. take stupid lies shove deep fat ass. reality average Swede suffering all.

Technically could still say US even (as bad is). However, no-one credible disputes US disaster area given unchecked growth large parts country, odds increasingly likely going stay way indefinitely.

Does anyone seriously doubt global strategy Swedish model, lot people would dead infected?

The mere fact Sweden 6164 dead population ten million numerous much larger countries much smaller death toll would seem indicate this.

Extreme case point, Vietnam almost 96 million people, multiple land borders including almost 1000 mile border China lot high density populated areas. Things could quite devastating gotten loose unchecked there. Long story short, shingles beginning 11 months horror mom finally died. died went batshit crazy low O2 lung scarring TB kid. lung scarring see covid.....

Whenever new law could potentially break constitution, needs examined thoroughly make sure violate anything constitution. takes time. risk breaking constitution big no-no here, following system rules place fundamental country governed.

You could argue system ineffective, true state crisis. protects democracy, also makes hard act speed necessity. result Sweden sheltered serious crisis long time - far area lacked preparedness. even then, changing system must still follow ramifications take time.

Also, nothing constitution beong ""holy"" anything like (like US). parliament change constitution somewhat regularly. is, however, important follow take time change. Viruses become less deadly due selective pressure, ones kill hosts effectively burn out. COVID spreads presymptomatically takes multiple weeks kill. seeing lot selective pressure there, unfortunately. Real question, say great news also plan get vaccine? completely true. test early late test may pick virus. False negatives big issue. Timing test extremely important. covid symptoms summer, doctor made get tested multiple times get antibody test. reason gave me. Thankfully wasn’t covid. iHop PACKED last night part ICC.

Nobody know even single N95. They’d rather look cute, comfortable. Even though unfiltered air going directly lungs.

The people complaining economic lockdowns, ones causing economic lockdown. doesn’t happen.  Great news! Two proven vaccines means there's better chance speed vaccination process. skew mental state test subject though?

The idea see gets infected doesn't, someone knew placebo, likely hunker avoid contact people? stay positive. see family, take win.
Haven't seen cousins 9 months frustrating.   live NY microcluster. numbers worse downstate. mom lives another microcluster. promised back September we'd come Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving really hard time her, mom died back around 2006 days before.

I feel safe going more. relationship mom close, abusive. I'm afraid reaction tell no. wish Cuomo would shut things down. Pfizer vaccine appears potent five days normal refrigeration temperatures, industrialized nations likely difficulties distributing countries poor transportation infrastructure look elsewhere vaccine. 2025 Oxford vaccine also two big neurological adverse events. would little iffy one. article exactly diseases impact racial groups differently. modern science?

 entire comment chain worthless? success rates basic procedures high graduation rates, we'd complaining lot price Aspirin.

Don't worry though, we'll find America socialized medicine soon enough. coming. world driving closer starting PS5 expensive even mean anything alternative ravaging global economy? I've read years past ever seen real progress good leads theories it. Maybe research went covid vaccine pay universal flu/cold vaccine!  sites mapping ICU capacities? great, likely trial non placebo, worst vaccine system.  Kind fucking pissed right now.  Oh feel hope relief, like end sight. watch happens irl. It’s gonna approved like 2 weeks Disturbed?? Ya idk there’s big conspiracy centered around releasing efficacy data stock market opens Moderna government.

Ockham’s Razor says get bang buck stock price. problem there, explains decision fully. Oh, I’m sure fine. I’m Alabama, that. I’m loving PACU moving West couple years, hopefully it’ll little sane. Thanks good thoughts! So, honestly looking stat (ignoring commenter pointed effects), bad .5% people got died, 5% people got something. Even 10%. there's positivity rate 50%, serious intervention, pretty much everyone going end getting it. .5% becomes much worse point. wear fucking mask. large portion Reddit said, optimism trending guess they're pretending never happened. know, get information press release, doesn’t count insider trading, definition.  Educated guess, probably getting downvoted admit point. anti-maskers, America also rest world, seems pretty high chance people also denying vaccines. Hopefully I'm wrong something done ensure people actually get vaccinated. people, think quite many people think. Also, there's like 208 million adults left 8 million. They'll LOT people would normally ignore vaccine get work require it, they'll need travel, get shows. want deal restrictions they'll it, probably bitching moaning entire time, they'll it. bad. really sure. edit. Thanks! suggesting china came clean Europe did?  care people dying.

conservatives interesting rescuing capital, people. Well, hyperbolic say everyone going long term problems, think fair say people worry it. There's plenty reason extra cautious *probably are* going lot long term issues *is* something need worried about. would pay $1k meant wouldn’t die virus destroyed world almost year now. less, sure, not, vaccine effective claim. Maybe need booster year so. Maybe point dies completely number years never mutates significantly enough current vaccines body T-cell reactions anything. possible, although unlikely - could (which often _not_ case lot formulated drugs), likely requires specific process/freezing setup/chilling rate, etc etc It’s kind reverse survivor bias though. You’re going hear people died, ones mild cases.

A bit like searching symptoms tends yield cancer horrible disease nobody writes times turned nothing.  burned precautions

Like memorial day. many talking like take vaccine (you point) absolutely get Covid. People taking steps keep safe continue get shot right away. fact, still majority getting vaccine still. courts much power overturn emergency powers *that listed state constitution.* country messed up. neither Krampus, don’t mess up. oxfords requires second shot 4 weeks first. Given know that, getting price from? Soo started China that's first cases detected. wait first cases Europe. must error. must still China's fault! Smh. write cheques cash. bill due. take patent 2019 Covid-19 issue? Keep going I’m almost  least stop showing now. Hopefully, still OK. Tldr “it depends.” Flying riskiest thing corona times, totally safe. Longer flights risky shorter flights. people wear masks flight less risky. Etc. someone formed offer best guess timeline distribution vaccines United States? Prior pandemic, never really fastidious washing hands eating, wiped grocery cart handles down, kept hand sanitizer around. see continuing kind stuff. well keeping extra TP around putting shopping fridge literally empty.

I'll give mask wearing quickly though. I’m best lower demand animal products, would hope others would well, yeah, we’re fast track. obviously can’t change global human behavior dime like need to, eat distribute resources. can’t even agree facts are, we’ll probably argue grave. best answer unfortunately: “personal choices towards whatever helps personally cope reality” since seems left. American wave seems much like waves Interstellar... That’s never going work. FDA doesn’t even wait normal circumstances. 

This data independently reviewed determined highly effective. Nah. Good luck convincing people opposed mask wearing get vaccine b take moment think about

How amazing smart enough multiple vaccines oven, smart enough wear masks Things tone quite bit surprised keeping hand sanitizer around, owning chest freezer, working home, even wearing masks public transportation stick around. Wishful thinking. happen. Senate remain Republican Biden cave ""freedom masks nothing"" crowd. feel giddy! Everyone hold tight get yours! know else goes body alters instructions cells, telling produce more? SARS-CoV-2. Well course it’s helpful it’s convincing show celebrity smiling million dollar home show someone mortality mistakes don’t follow guidelines Ant-Mask transitions Anti-Vaxx  Thank cumstain anti-mask friends. Change back :( like people completely forgot reason trying flatten curve, exactly prevent type thing happening.

Many comments see people think lockdowns restrictions end virus pandemic. understand specifically trying avoid.

And recently, we've mostly flattened curve. now... I'm actually worried. looks like get ugly.   understand. hope fully recover. thing elusive. worry though first MRNA vaccine though read. I’m jumping get it, that’s me. I've heard may able return normal end 2021. Yes indeed, let's see. fact 2020 Sweden better economically. administrations mean, CARES Act also stated COVID-19 testing must free Trump admin made good promise far. live USA there's good chance idea I'm talking like 0.2% CFR, obviously asymptomatic. schools opening

this. new Nvidia GPU also launched September aka available general public... People still waiting cards able purchase one... neither response comment original comment factually wrong, add point, website also kicked US hopefully appreciate bias Genuinely, poor, poor thing. Sorry they've done deductive reasoning skills. sincerely hope turns around one day. “Tell election vaccine you!” get sentiment, “normal” desire illusion largely what’s gotten us keeps things swirling drain. especially fond glib statements “new normal” either would kind behoove people recognize shortcomings whole thing’s shoving rather trying grasp things led us anyway?


(I support Fauci way- think use trying appeal lot people gobble nonsense can’t blame seriously, optics one things) Oh wow can't believe see won’t case lol  go further. 
Let anti vaccination folks live separate areas called ghettos. 
Maybe even ban sitting bus too

Even separate drinking fountains benches too

It’ll separate equal huh. Logistics distributing vaccine, yes, logistics convincing anti-vaxxers take it? even logistics preventing people signing anti-vax cult bullshit?

We already masks work tremendously well diminish spread even use those.

The vaccine news awesome, yes, suspect even disappointed fellow humans reject science keep pandemic alive. must nice sanity :) DeWine seens brain Covid understood early on. states need Governors like  


Why? states achieve 7000 cases day? opposite effect people. Putting actual end sight makes feel whole lot better locking down. skeptical first because, vaccine? feels lot temporary Literally iconic. Release ha freedom work man, making rich, freedom blow money, making richer? wonder Americans going get vaccine afford it. Governments already purchased vaccines Pfizer, well many med companies. We're looking possibly 4-5 working vaccines, necessary none really work way. 

The different vaccines help people various medical conditions otherwise. Depending potential side-effects. No, skin light. 30 second (google) research found put one (like pfizer's) ""ethnically uncontroversial"" tested using fetal cell line taken aborted baby...

This makes even happier :) pretty much lockdown. Hope guys shut got wanted Cutbacks hospital pandemic. 

The insanity sentence palpable. US it’s looking like large position United States vaccinated winter / early 2021.  fictional young workers? front line cashier positions commonly held young high school/college students. and, even full grown adult workers don’t deserve attacked aggressive customers mask problem schools forced reopen in-person learning late-sept/early-oct -- explains timeline we're seeing surge cases/deaths now. Without police support, governors orders meaningless  matters gets market first, people pay. Companies absolutely dying buy staff. think much first 10-30 million vaccines business-to-business deals supply various essential workers. never heard Zeeland you’re telling there’s new one? evil people think big pharma is, think employees would allow companies price gouge either. Unfortunately student loan debt many doctors makes it. even get started resident physicians basically enslaved job want get board certified actually able work physician paid minimum wage. resident quits unlikely able practice medicine like 300k+ debt. Yup. That’s way parents acting sister, too. Constantly saying “stay safe. vaccine way.” Unfortunately, feel like lot people already going take going see 100% effective take due unknowledgeable vaccines. I’m Europe, doesn’t look like get vaccine 2021 either. *Twenty-five percent reported increased substance use deal stress. *

Rookies. /s

Has anyone drank less shit show? know I’ve watched much Dark anything German gets accompanied [this especially something explained story shared.  Dear Swedish less month since state epidemiologist stated ""covid less dangerous passing pedestrian crossing"",less month since allowed 300ppl per surprised ""people behave like danger over""? pretty much right now. 
I got swept Walmart 0-4, 0-1 target, 0-1 Sony friday. genuinely think nobody getting them... black? good thinking reason thing way dp them. Google randomized double-blind placebo controlled study. suggesting start welding people shut inside homes? don’t know link. Biden Cuomo made public statements regarding suspicion safety vaccine. easy enough find, google that’s straight lie 18 year olds don’t deserve attacked either. one does. cost decrease time. production increases learnings/improvements process (or process reagents) decrease costs going forward. might massive decrease (time time... especially looking costs outside USA). bridge socialized health care. govt needs see spending federal money health nation equals thriving economy. certain overweight orange person go.down dirtiest according some.

Once developed, mRNA technology could used many viruses. scheduled mine Wednesday. Hoping best. US military budget almost three-quarters trillion dollars. constant dollar (inflation adjusted) basis, fluctuated much $150 billion per year last 10 years (eg 2010 $850 billion, adjusted inflation). dump hundreds billions dollars “defense” every year—and find extra $100B get real hankering blow poor people 8,000 miles away—I’m sure manage $10 billion literally end plague. Oh please anyone half brain cell figure government lie back lying now.

People panicking hoarding anything everything. Toilet paper things, people buying year supply it.

At time shortage PPE developing healthcare workers. frankly way important you. lie, buy supply. 

The people refusing wear mask using government said back excuse. government said back please wear mask would find excuse. agree look US. elected reality star president. famous people get regular joes take seriously I’m it.  Stop it. exactly we're screwed cases USA begin with. People can't manage wear mask cautious social distancing ""fatigued"" 6-7 months pandemic wear mask, can't eat restaurants, grind dozen girls nightclub.

Suck bit longer. Even get vaccinated we'll practice ""new normal"" another six months ensure coronavirus less eradicated. Doubt it'll possible time soon. EU preordered fuckton vaccines, nearly every major country world. backlog going immense production real bottleneck.

In two years time, that'd fun gimmick however, hope I'm wrong doubt it'll necessary then. Cries Texan !! I'd wager virus likely spread long Hotspot cropped up. unreasonable believe virus started stayed one spot early transmission OP likely thinking treatment methods - I'm medical professional understand require different approaches resolve issues. Also, mental health level, essentially talking problems discussing coping methods therapist, others require heavy medication even shock therapy (yes still done lot safe boring think.)

Also, addictions started mental health - lot opioid addicts started prescribed medication manage pain cut off. everyone mental health issue addict. two may go hand-in-hand sometimes time. one seems talking reinfection context vaccine discussion. 

Is thing Vaccines? 

It hot topic got infected reinfected months later.  really expensive piece mind. nurse. come back ED maternity leave covid hit. already burnt that, swearing going find new job leave, course busy spending time little nugget. Unfortunately ICU stay January, fear covid heightened, scared going bring home infant. Add understaffing, lack PPE, people department taking things seriously even though people department contracted covid..... left bedside July. work mostly home clinical research. miss bedside, miss patient interaction, miss nursing skills miss coworkers. fact healthcare become profit driven patient driven really pushing lot us away bedside, covid speeding process. It’s shame. I’ve seen many fantastic HCW walk away taken granted are. Yeah according many Americans, people die preventable deaths better SoCiAlIsT. Healthcare would TERRIBLE country.

Currently waiting plethora excuses it’s fine us still get together.

what could go wrong that! Medications vaccines made US generally priced point recoup research development costs, ones sell elsewhere generally subject local pricing. generic made, formula sold pharmaceutical company another country, ends lot cheaper.

I idea apply coronavirus vaccines, that's generally things go. agree thanks, I’m happy survived people family too! Cheers! mean, pay like 1,000 bucks mortgage per month, rounding error would like $5.

Im antivax whatsoever, believe drug companies every incentive make sure stuff safe, absolutely way anyone know long term effects unintended consequences altering genetics body like this.

I get sketched start altering nature like this, mrna vaccines, altering viruses act vector disease control altering organism like mosquito combat malaria (or whatever) things mutate change, world static

We good track record species go tinkering nature....even something benign sounding introducing house cats environment control rats enormous detrimental downstream effects- look Australia New Zealand, matter ""island"" environment plagued invasive species.

Im wary history backs regard  hoping FDA looks much vaccine reduces transmission. Due rushed nature development I’m sure there’s time compare way. what's wrong America, appreciation knowledge.  [Normal vaccination *is* ""shockingly affordable"", several times actually one people moderna coronavirus vaccine trials got vaccine! hyped read this! also know didnt get placebo either test came back positive covid antibodies. im still taking precautions case. world bigger united states.

Just SARS originated China doesn’t mean novel coronaviruses can’t originate elsewhere. Europe bats coronaviruses like China has. MERS didn’t come China. thought couldn’t get better, Refrigeration one difficult aspects delivering vaccines non-affluent countries. ""Cold chain"" infrastructure (particularly ultra-cold temps, like -80°C) expensive useful every vaccine, vaccinrs stored higher temperature, would huge benefit global delivery vaccine.

I'm honestly surprised people posting DIY medical procedures self-surgery guides YouTube Americans point... hospitals make money treating sick people. make money elective procedures. lose huge amounts money ICU care. ER docs easy place cut corners make wait times longer patients, hire APP cover bread butter cases probably even belong ER first place. Sad ? 
What's sad action say lack result many deaths. definitely ""zone bell curve"" effect, plus healthy dose tradeoffs - doctors running profitable private practice, rather toiling away hospitals stupid working hours. person asking, honestly anyone who's regularly hospital caregiver setting even building first dibs. even think would debate, since hospitals care homes paying anyway.

Or put another way, thousands people refusing tests? people, work pandemic far worse financial crisis. Many would die, many would hospitalized, could face worse financial crisis due shitball medicare situation country. Even survive hospitalized, still know full extent damage virus. studies showing COVID exposure could lead long term mental damage. know reddit HATES china asians handled virus extremely because:

1) people actually scared 

2) people actually listens government 

3) china fk around. LOCK dont follow order. 

&amp;#x200B;

most westerners selfish individuals compare asian countries- That's biggest difference. westerners = self serving ppl. Asians = community serving ppl evidence this. Please stop repeating lie. Given current pandemic, given threats already made life, kind vague tweet ""coronavirus advisor"" needs censored Twitter becomes viral misinformation. give qualified, detailed remarks later (saying whatever measure needs contested court, peaceful protest, etc.) pass filters, say ""people rise up"" gives license extremism. pathetic doctor, public health official, would write like Twitter. However initial lot.

The point initial deaths epidemic started, countries prepared lot deaths attributed simple mistakes protecting different populations. really want honest comparison different countries models making society work pandemic fare other, good chose date first wave real father worked medical consultant full time 83. relatives still working 70s 80s. there's lot productive years post 65 lost.

Even +65 get Corona diagnosis, death sentence. point deaths mostly +65 age group two fold: 

* Deaths happening active age groups, important Spanish flue deaths actually age group 15-40. Spanish flue shocking societies Corona epidemy started, comparing Corona Spanish flue, later seen, false comparison.
* Deaths age group +65 mostly happen people already bad condition, like said before, Corona got elderly care homes spiked deaths. Later Swedes managed keep Corona care Also, often pleasant death people seem neglect mentioning keep bringing whole ""those people old already died, though"" line argument.

That argument. deaths case least 6164 Swedes great.

Most would anyway died soon, either Corona Also, we're comparisons, Vietnam. country population 9 times Sweden deaths continue present rate/year Sweden more, Vietnam catch 175 years.

The reason comparisons Vietnam China countries free. autocracies information free. China Vietnam would running kind death rates example Sweden, would know that? example Sweden 2018, according official statistics 2701 people died Influenza. would testing Corona, would know epidemy? death rates high make visible country Maybe, hear here, maybe they're not.

You decide statistics looking order say that. According deaths per capita, done bad. remove initial deaths beginning, get much different view long term trends different countries having. rushed vaccine, that's entire process about. Whether rushed means bad, good, separate question. 

Either way, time gets it'll lot testing first. I'm elderly healthcare worker. watch results months people take it. They're higher risk, therefore higher risk/reward, potential downsides vaccinating would still mean benefit less-good vaccine. China""s feeling like Randy Marsh said bat. done late January early February government shows small amount competence.

Have met government? wonder can't report last year. Or, instead denial, NZ test frozen food in-case maybe prevent another mysterious outbreak. 

I guess different people different priorities. I’m 30+ years old sister laughs wearing mask crowded places, saying “some people wear masks, they’re usually risk group”. think people becoming accepting masks Sweden, official recommendation *against* masks made take way long should’ve. Denmark trying create new pandemic. culling mink set pause government legal grounds killing uninfected mink-farms. actual threat cluster-5 COVID thankfully materialize. say something wrong America. Seems country lot socipaths. Borders closed, it’s likely Europeans New Zealand passport 
Not Americans travel increase chance death contracting virus could good chance surviving without vaccine?

That's really immune system works. even was, trials still showing net benefit - reduces chance symptoms 90%, 10% doubled chance death - still significantly lower chance death overall. probably 1% chance death age bracket less disease (considering Reddit demographics); hypothetical vaccine would reduce chance death 0.2%. gives 5x better chances survival; I'd go that.

But I'm still waiting full results 3rd phase trial, proper peer-reviewed study. trust based press release halfway point. best put boundaries going subjects

Agree! Wish sooner really make sense, no.

Just one two superspreading events turn microstate disaster per capita basis.  Including rankings purpose evaluating performance makes little sense.

Again, San Marino basically small town Italy. already know Italy, surrounds entirety, problematic. Yall realize regular citizens get vaccinated months years right?

Just like saw start testing, athletes celebrities come first every time doc here. Luckily laid big pandemic cutbacks started, contract renewed year, soon jobless. small community hospitals sticks even hiring, I've found 40+ people applying one position. Meanwhile, medical directors struggling adequately staff facilities due corporate hiring freezes, opening positions cut profits.

Any discussion field Biden's proposed policies might impact landscape? others stated...""People care"". 

Same could said smoking (tobacco) bad you...some states tax shit it, warning labels it, restrictions smoke public places, etc.

Unfortunately, Americans people general...are fucking retarded, entitled, pieces shit.
Stalin said best ""One death tragedy, million (deaths) mere statistic"". States alone, COVID deaths several Wars...combined, span less year. 

You think bad now? Wait till Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's...the deaths rise, hospitals either full capacity damn near close it, others supplementing refrigeration trucks, cause morgues full capacity...and older medical specialist, straight quitting they're burnt constant 12-hour shifts little help state local governments...it's bad, hospitals states head hunting personnel lucrative offers get work month, contract. shatter anything. Genome tracing already determined Wuhan original strain, case load across Asia compared Europe/US consistent virus arriving last prior detection, testing capacity early policy testing travelers consistent low number confirmed Europe/US cases time, 2nd/3rd wave growth rate death-lag, applied first wave, consistent Europe/US outbreak starting Fall 2019, that's get NATO briefings November

The 'finding' shatters assumption test first must origin. Yeah even Aus pandemic also control, (touch wood) Victoria reached 2 weeks zero cases, there's small outbreak 17 cases today Adelaide probably came quarantined overseas traveller somehow. They're starting ramp restrictions Adelaide tho, government toes. Nowadays danger us Aus/NZ virus escaping quarantined overseas travellers. state u in? possible point early mutated got infectious ? totally relate drama conspiracy theories - people know (worst mother) it’s become obsession.

It’s constant barrage fight-picking hostility matter much consistently won’t engage her. You’re absolutely right, really ruining relationships. 

The best put boundaries going subjects people get worked it’s like can’t control themselves. It’s maddening also sad see someone go rabbit holes far it’s negatively effecting life. Nope, chinese vaccines best hope. Stop spreading misinformation. Reuters article posted states data storage phase 1 2 trials. Even states storage information 1 chinese vaccines them.

Chinese vaccines require 2-8°C 5 months storage.

There many vaccines prepared nations commited supplies COVAX.

Serum Institute India planned supply 500 million doses Low Middle Income countries.

Bharat Biotech talks regional countries supply license them.

Australia commited $500 million provide vaccines South East asian countries.

Sanofi pledged 200 million doses COVAX. 

Biological E (India) produce 1 billion doses Asian Market well African.

Novavax similar deal Serum Institute India provide 2 billion doses Low Middle Income countries.

Chulakorn University Thailand also stated vaccine shared SE asian countries.

Looking comment history, clear CCP supporter trying deflect credibles blames accusations china. Additionally trying potray chinese vaccines logistically viable third world countries true.

You try hide bias ""storage"" requirements.


Many Indian well Western vaccines tough storage requirements.

Just Pfizer certain degree Moderna.

J&amp;J, Novavax, Covaxin, Codagenix, Zydus Cadila, AstraZeneca, CureVac, Biological E, Sanofi &amp; GSK, Medicago name few.

Many western vaccines also added advantage Single Dose (J &amp; J), Intranasal (Codagenix University Washington- Bharat Biotech).

Stop spreading misinformation.

But imagine this: highly qualified professional. put anti vaxxers long. put anti maskers. actually burn bullshit job, people handle level stress would jump ship immediately. lose job.

I know I'd getting visa application sorted. Spend year 2 Canada, UK, Australia, Mexico. kind need health system fail completely ridiculous country. can't read article since subscription, forgive about, I've heard things repeated many times feel like know...

It unreasonable believe ""everyone"" Sweden infected. since Fauci et al talking second wave beginning, Swedish government/hospitals/etc likely preparing this. Swedish government said along never expected goal.

All trying allow Swedish people normal life possible, without authoritarian (but well-intentioned) laws. Instead, made recommendations put limit gathering size. Realistically, probably makes difference masks, much less lockdown. Sweden ended high positivity rate cited failure part. That's works delay it.

And unlike US, Swedish people lot trust government. (Why they, take care everything them!) need formally declare laws get people actually listen.

That said, I'm US, there's way would happen way here. difference population density major factor. availability healthcare another. fact we're one unhealthy countries thus likely people die it... also factor. importantly, think attitude towards government, large part due fact government served well. guarantee Swedish people followed limited crowd guideline better many people US did.

So feel like whole ""Sweden going herd immunity"" thing (which misappropriated term anyway, GET HERD IMMUNITY VACCINE, MEAN ""DO NOTHING"") kind straw man argument that's repeatedly used criticize Sweden's coronavirus strategy. Legit every time see article someone shitting them. really tiring. Possibly remember vaccines often less effective elderly. would risky focus limited resource (vaccine) population may robust immune response. We'll get herd immunity without them.

After couple million deaths, sure. acting late.. Hang there! stormy daniels fake news, explains trump recovered covid fast understand dogged defense status quo. seems like people would rather suffer insult people rather actually wanting something better everyone...except course wealthy. people seem outright worship wealthy people feel deep desire protect costs.

I'm Croatia already mostly flat here. numbers still high, sure, nothing would manageable. seems virus started strong lose breath quickly. Everyone talking 'long, scary covid winter' think winter smooth, mostly thanks current wave. 

We need remember high number cases also means people immunity going winter. mask mandates restrictions large groups people place, flu also lose momentum really, things really look grim. Sounds like fun. I'm thinking opening hotel resort run, defended, robots Oh honey... Old news reconfirmed.

By contrast, paper products aisle mostly empty, liquid disinfecting cleaners Getting sick spoiled food going worse people skipping meals.

What's weird think Australia New Zealand much better examples keeping numbers low masking up. Mask-wearing rate low never required (except VIC) yet are. someone supports masks frankly know argue I'm always worried anti-maskers countries would use us justification. nah, contradicts nothing, want believe want believe. also censor hard CCP times.

RN getting LTC work back bedside, I'm terrified. places hide reward danger. It’s fine. think moving slowly. Navajo nation went 3 week lockdown. nightly curfew past months. Cases surge every weeks go full weekend lockdown well (57hr lockdown). also helped Arizona flip blue. say pretty well 2020. uncle physician. died COVID. 

So yeah, understandable doctors would call quits instead continue try save lives, especially sizeable portion well sitting POTUS refuse wear masks insist virus conspiracy.

Yeah, tend avoid crowded places instead. I'm gonna put mask go buy beer nachos, start modding Rimworld again. Ya think? curious, overnight santization prevent aerosolized circulation classrooms next day? going gets tough, tough get kicked curb Proven correct? said Sweden worse deaths per capita almost countries.

and now: ""a couple hundred deaths per day France rates."" simply way knowing now, deaths lag countries France showing excess deaths last weeks. I'm waiting predictions.

No, think correct think specific want make predictions. mean cumulative deaths?

I'll reminders dm next time worry. I’m sorry family’s tragic loss.  Yeah, funniest thing. Czechs relaxed basically everything summer. fall wave came. Everyone blamed us irresponsible, look around, measures place ok, facemasks, yadda yadda. 

Now everyone climbs, everyone. Weve started drop. Looks like virus doesnt care. Everyone go this, weve started one month sooner winter wave flu arrives. might even kinda normal christmas.  Warming us oncoming famine flood. I'd also like point utterly fucking useless first stimulus was. $1200? First all, miss paycheck, working remotely. Second, live MA, that's half single mortgage payment. rush like ""virus? virus? Make sure keep buying useless shit Amazon hundreds thousands people get sick die!"". 

They could sat figured give small business owners people able work remotely access relief money things closed. Instead, wasted it, forced everything open safe. federal government absolutely embarrassing failure.  imagine someone wanted start school busses kids. Luckily people sub decision makers.

Not me! Yeah that's we're fortunate captain following advice. single case make past quarantines back general population. started lockdown early let up. know gets we're fucked. Swedish health officials insist face masks offer false sense security lead people forget social distancing 

There's truth this. Alot people understand mask prevent getting covid reduce risk social distancing important thing apply.

Well looked curve? New infections record numbers, U.S. worldwide, course action necessary. goal always same: keep number deaths low reducing spread virus various means. see US. say ""oh shit masks deaths #1.""

Mask usage seems way higher U.S Sweden. following news, seeing random photographs videos U.S, mask policies stores etc. Meanwhile Sweden go shopping centre see 100 people, maybe 5 wear masks. majority deaths modern world slow, painful expensive. Ever met anyone dying cancer? Thats hell nasty way go. Spending $10 fuel money food. think I’ll wait till others experiment  hope so. explain bit 'second wave summer'? first time hear it. Absolutely. cornerstone strategy conspiracy theory strategy: find single example something, claim widespread.

I would even go say impossible assign single cause death certainty anyone. notorious example person Colorado died ""with"" covid blood alcohol level far beyond fatal. initially lumped single ""COVID deaths"" group, reason separate group split off. course, know COVID attacks liver, could certainly primary cause death person regularly drinks heavily. get choose.

Obviously we're trending +110% something new cases day, anyone see 1 million cases day happening? main fear. know first vaccines made publicly available US ? ok everyone, COVID-19 nocturnal!

It's people socialize lot often hang night. That's one sayings is: ""Early rise, early bed makes man healthy, socially dead"". federal government withheld money states don’t mask requirements, states would get line. could argued 100% masks masks masks effective 100% usage. likely.

Fair point.

Sure. example given course smaller country easier manage. countries compare like that.

The larger country is, larger resources (nurses/industrial capacity/chemical test labs) combat virus. sheer population size present difficulties. scale well entry points.

The US really border Mexico worry international airports seaports. Whilst 15 times population Australia doubt 15 times many entry points Australia. things equal US (and Europe probably) less entry points scaled population. conceivably easier manage virus.

The countries hard small and/or poor countries proportionally many entry points. Small countries may infrastructure produce required goods (ppe/test kits) may numbers skills (managers/nurses/computerised contact tracing/ICU units manage surges) easily manage outbreak. would apply places like Denmark / Switzerland / Central American countries lot African countries.

So think argument made smaller countries harder. said that, Australia probably easier countries comparable population due wealth/guaranteed food supply high level industrial sophistication. and? what's got pandemic? zuck bezos target ire, they're ones profiting many ways causing fucking pandemic first place. musk another billionaire asshole.

Maybe best way keep everyone alive though. Daaaamn, speculating October, Sept? Maaaaan. Imagine spread.. that's almost 6 months free range virus. Interesting people dieing covid December .. cant make make sense days. Lol incredible news terms accelerating overall process also access remote locations.

Considering Moderna part WARP operation, hopefully see exorbitant prices US unlike rest world!

I hope Moderna outsource cooperate production though, capacity seems way limited even course entire next year!  virus deaths useless metric imaginable

total deaths thing counts, post shows none really happy see specific callout prevented severe cases well, small handful vaccine group test positive. 

Hopefully positive vaccine news keeps coming; viable candidates, sooner we'll able get post regulatory approval distribution. distinction viral load - amount virus patient given time course infection, initial dose (inoculam) - amount virus 'delivered' initial infection site.

The argument (via reasonable means delivery) initial dose relatively small, immune response illness occurs virus replicated exponentially host tissues much higher titre, upon disease progresses regardless small initial dose was.

Low exposure reduce likelihood infection taking hold, perhaps effect incubation time, otherwise catch it, catch it. like japanese bus drivers did, don’t accept money treat people anyway. Hit pocket.  ☝ contents Pfizer vaccine? might, though. guy 80 longer everyone alive. can’t figure communicate things way doesn’t get interpreted dozen ways? many rounds CPR patients code usually get? Look ofcourse “the best years life” comepletely relative. people 18-29, people older (or even way older that) maybe “best years life correct choice words. However, maybe necessarily best years, theyre still unique terms them. Enjoying spendig time kids, going beautifull vacation, wonderfull christmas dinner friends family, great things, pretty much time life. 30’s, 40’s 50’s etc. getting black drunk, nights ridiculous things happen, pulling nighters parties festivals, short flings flirts people long lasting commitments. things become increasingly less common (and time increasingly sad worrying keep long) get older. perphaps youth isnt best time life, unique, essential get wild phase settle different kind fun. Dont try downplay saying youll fun later. Sure ill fun later, want memories time still able (and energy to) different kind fun. huge factor Covid causing serious problems death, blood clotting. 

Quite people genetic predisposition thick blood. included. three four markers warned part daily life. 

Getting virus literally thickens blood even take certain people edge. anyone wants see actual academic article rather media, link:  article:

The trial involved 30,000 people US half given two doses vaccine, four weeks apart. rest dummy injections.

The analysis based first 95 develop Covid-19 symptoms.

Only five Covid cases people given vaccine, 90 given dummy treatment. company says vaccine protecting 94.5%.

The data also shows 11 cases severe Covid trial, none happened people immunised.

""The overall effectiveness remarkable... great day,"" Tal Zaks, chief medical officer Moderna, told BBC News. “Wake sheeple!”

We’re closing 2000 virus deaths per day US guy thinks everything’s gravy. can't hospitals charge need covid patients? Soon? NOW. beds live. Hospitals begging Stitt mask mandate nope getting Trump Jr. mean, point, you’re going drop talking point. 

We’ve watched virus spread several states took steps curb it, Florida, described never happened. 

Hell, El Paso bad, people may literally stepping dead bodies way Best Buy family. 

The truth many don’t want admit people decided continue virus. economic collapse. nothing sort. 

People continue living though virus doesn’t exist. 

We’ve seen again. 

Why you’re afraid admit this, idea, may you’re confused. world see happening clearly isn’t, people responding world real you’re living one made up. 

This disconnect see feel. think need bring back Samuel L. Jackson's message April: [Stay f\**k Someone explain draw conclusions 95 people 30,000 actually got virus? say level certainty prevents getting COVID-19? are: little chance study false.  administrative bureaucracy grown larger larger time, compensation workers ACTUALLY see patients relatively small percentage overall cost structure. end goal could eradication like Asia, heard immunity hold vaccine. know Swedish goal eradication never belive strongly [vaccination study done surgical masks prevent aerisolized influenza 2013 family setting. got study, work well hoped. seem see lot stories like younger people.

The media reporting elderly coming shying away reporting statistics nation. example look Israeli statistics, (male) age group comes 2nd amount people catching Chrome order translate English). wondering tribe sudden able hire doctors PAs NPs 10 years spent trying find funding studying long term effects mass vaccination started.

Wrong. 
A years spent studying disease. 
Then years spent developing vaccine itself. 
Then multiple lengthy phases drug trials. 
 
There considerable amount work, years, goes making sure new drug/vaccine safe people consume. 
 cutting development time extremely easy without affecting normal safety procedures. 
 
Wrong. 
That development time specifically make sure end product safe. safe way skip step.  2 8 deg Fahrenheit lasts 30 days pretty great news topic RNA vaccines. Moderna's shown similar results BioNtech / Pfizer's preliminary data last week something could big way. they're par future vaccine development could expanded include whole lot different diseases able make much ground vaccine development Don’t mean piss anyone’s chips Moderna 95% number indistinguishable Pfizer 90% draw error bars around numbers. 

However it’s clear extremely effective vaccines. Absolutely astonishing news. reckon there’s one four chance us fortunate enough live developed economies back normality Easter. stated scientific Covid Reddit likely vaccines would effective many vaccines set hit market within next months able beat back virus lot sooner believe (of course anti-vaxxers took it) think countries report deaths last 24 hours dont include backdated deaths infections also? New infections new deaths reported roughly way everywhere. 

Sweden reported 40 new ones day last two days gave figures for. Everyones figures lag dont really see point. Obviously Im super worried hate we’re facing “second” wave America. it, terrible, hoping still antibodies.

But gotta say lining release new consoles games convenient. Try country requires yellow fever passport Let’s make rich pay too! Gyms shut, limit ten people house, 4m square people density places, stand drinking stopped, etc.

And effectively fall one person million people turn time....

Might good social distancing.

I can't help feel stupidity question actually annoyed writing response. ... goes lungs.

He likely immunosuppressants so, yeah. side note. &amp; Doff N95 masks. hope planning using different mask video. There's specific procedure take n95. Charles Darwin Swidish Came say exactly this. got people dieing streets. People without food, water, basic health care.

(I’m joking, know it’ll take longer even vaccines) Good work moderna! I'm beginning think results fake sell vaccines huge investment Wow, that's quite difference. Amazing news, really starting feel like end could sight. needs 1 shot needs take advice doctors facebook telling true facts virus true. Unless station guards force people wear masks, people wear them. called free will. want claim rushed?

Most 10 years spent trying find funding studying long term effects **after** mass vaccination started. also factoring basing vaccines work done SARS MERS, around many years.

When lot data knowledge start with, get unlimited funding, cutting development time extremely easy without affecting normal safety procedures. Well least voting public rise vote idiot responsible letting covid 19 run wild USA. still leaves many millions good nothing though.

I remember time long ago USA respected valued science. Seems like dream now. Nope, two. Masks public stores red herring. People gathering private, always done. I've never actually seen heard anybody wearing mask home. theater point, pure simple. 

It's like wondering kids keep born despite never actually seeing anyone around sex. Rest assured happening. becoming relatively consistent finding across different vaccine(s) studies, quite promising news.

Good see Sweden starting common sense. pipeline studies dried somewhat due covid, basically red tape traffic jams, speak, gone saying there's something disputes results they've published? making claims?  vulnerable people ones spreading virus. They're ones likely taking precautions fewer social contacts. get sick, get severe case can't ignored they're walking around spreading it.

Young healthy people spreading it. People can't afford take day work. People get mild case dismiss ""just like flu"". people vaccinated community spread stop. We'll keep precautions going every risk person vaccinated, vaccines 100% effective, even healthy people sometimes get severe cases. $10 billion pretty much rounding error.

BuT VAcciNES ExIsT MaKe BiG PHarMA MoneIES! Well that’s talking yeah Coronaviruses mutate quickly.

But yes, spreads, greater risk fo dangerous mutation. really seem trust corporate lords envious ability so. Wait.. already it? figure Sweden becoming ""villain""?
Sweden 20th death rate per capita, dropping ranking currently. guess 19 villains care about, huh? people downplaying distribution issues mainly wanting make sure stay good little sheep next summer. 

(Sure, vaccinate at-risk call 'done', that's moving goal posts. Many people, even healthy 50, feel safe unless vaccinated due media fear mongering date.) Big change foe Sweden makes wonder they'll pursuing mRNA vaccines future. several viruses we've conventionally found difficult inoculate for, mRNA might trick. We'll see. Usually it’s me, husband, three kids parents TG. wear masks way much. feeling little guilty found FIL (who check several risk categories himself) started working Planet Fitness.

Like wtf - everything we’ve discussed them- head going explode. He’s even fitness nut, far - needs get out. *But public gym??* Nope. Sorry, TG company year. Oh good know thanks. Saying loud think voice dictation error Idk i'd call admittion. seem going ""thid plan along"" path. 

But may starting actually something atleast yay? Yeah, likelihood death getting heads 7 coin flips, long odds, nothing bet life on. Especially considering long term health problems would occur 3 coins coming heads up. Russia, person bite spider. like game pourcentage labs money win stock exchange . look manipulated Pennsylvania, like didn’t immediately recognize state cities in. take DHS budget call national security issue, Trump already set precedents necessary. Maybe get test, case? Reddit seem care part. Yeah businesses want, least won’t federally enforced ❤️ would like too, take trip limited 8 people. same? 50 people restaurant, 8 people can’t. dental cleaning scheduled March 2020. cancelled. dentist wants reschedule it, going it.

My entire family's dental cleanings overdue. going anytime soon.

The annual physicals eye exams. using tele-medicine going medical office unless absolutely necessary. long term effects though? Tough talk guy got special antibodies caused superspreader event. come socialist wet dreamers 3....2....1 Wow good news. ""Pretty sure already caught it"" highest form evidence 2020 actual creation vaccine takes little time genetic coding. I’m talking weeks. time comes running clinical trials, opinion, exact length need be. want longer timeline safety events would already reveal themselves. 99% adverse events vaccines occur less 4 months, certainly don’t want cut « Used » makes sound like aren’t voluntarily it’s also pretty dehumanizing. Since still vast portion US population think attempt limit spread, I'm predicting apocalyptic death counts. think lot people get portable morgues every town even get then. Looking spring 2021  agree, crazy many people dying *even with* 100 years advances medical technology. so? cut hand foot, still you. like situation, true. Damage brain enough longer you. You’re customer. business could legally serve regardless feelings. there’s legal precedent (colleges turning away students vaccinating) Challenge trials conducted NovaVax That's Pfizer also developed shipping bottle keeps proper temperature dry ice. doctor needs two deliveries week manage that. civil war terrible business inconvenient. end day sides going complain social media, never going put effort fight actually risk things Spring realistic actually, earlier Tbf id assume using similar process everyone else expect similar results. I’d quicker question data safety, there’s great reason assume scientists didn’t public’s bets interests mind developed it. I’d hate guy gives vlad bunk medication. mean, Fauci man, fuck's sake, every sentence forms quoted used headline. know going play out, defense, ton non-epidemiological factors need addressed vaccine. US government DEFINITELY going burden process, since Trump likely going commit burning every possible bridge way out. Fauci charge creating, testing distributing vaccine, wish journalists general population would let thing stop hailing herald vaccine. know going play out. the. Dude refute actual claims please mean worst anything, best saving lives. use them? cancelled person thanksgiving instead husband cooking big dinner dropping nearby family members eat together video chat. Pro-covid-life  Im interested fact mRNA vaccine, makes wonder exactly mean effective.

As general rule thumb, effective vaccines providing long-term immunity, live-attenuated vaccines. Followed killed vaccines. Followed toxoid vaccines (which take protein toxin produced microbe, conjugate virus transforms DNA). 

So wonder effectiveness mRNA vaccine range toxoid vaccine, like somewhere effectiveness toxoid vaccine killed vaccine. 

mRNA, btw neither DNA protein, transitional product two. stands reason, little better toxoid vaccine conferring long term immunity, probably less effective live-attenuated vaccine. 

Of course, effectiveness live-attenuated vaccines depends also organism. flu live-attenuated, flu shot last year isnt gonna protective long. that's influenza fast-mutating S.O.B., COVID-19 hasnt proven be. course COVID-19 dangerous even think live-attenuated vaccine. issue think timeline way optimistic. It'll take longer think  Well, billionaire earn extra $1,000, working class slowly killed off, also shown life worthless compared economy, also time energy eaten menial work instead time go protest, matter many people need die, worth elites.

Money, making workers feel powerless, stripping ability people act effective, thus maintaining status quo. That's about. Asshole comment, think mean wary. Wary means cautious, weary means tired  Facebook probably worst thing happen developed world long time.

But Facebook would something else. People buying conspiracy theories *want* to. people full impotent rage, look someone blame, fighting COVID *definition* impotent. get point. fine. Making claims young people mostly making working group true help point. interesting note paper: 
___
Our results show living COVID-19 patient increased risk contagion 60 times. Among sociodemographic variables analyzed, walking dog shown strongest effect increasing risk 78%. effective hygiene measure reducing prevalence disease disinfection products purchased market upon arrival home (which reduced risk 94%), hygiene measures, wearing masks, gloves, ethanol disinfection, bleaching others. mobility variable studied showed largest increase prevalence disease working site workplace (increased risk 76%). **A significant higher prevalence disease also detected among respondents used modality acquiring basic commodities using home delivery service compared chose in-store shopping.**
___
Any guesses could be?? No, certain amount time thawed stored normal refrigerator room temperatures giving individual dose. Ultra cold temps shipping distribution storage week long timescale, vial doses might defrosted normal refrigerator day two used within hour removed that.

Those numbers going different type vaccine, think one stored extremely cold temperatures last 7 days normal refrigerator example, different allowable time dose come room temperature injected. physician mother retired years ago there’s way would kept working pandemic. former practice dropped salaries 75% everything shut March - totally worth exposure. People love say never offer proof. What’s point fudging numbers don’t even fudge look even remotely good? You’d least make one absolute worst states. might could fudge cases, can’t mess deaths hospitalizations, case rate matches those. Well.. it’s like “all people who’ve kicking screaming let consequences wilful ignorance bite ass”, see point.

However, it’s months months, don’t goodwill left. Fuck’em modern day vaccine development like old days. like tested. side effects near minimal. research. thousand people die day put out. imagine one March 2021 knowing working vaccine available go red tape still. HIV another Coronavirus, possible, though fact infects immune system likely complicates matter. course! see like flu? 



/S McConnell going bring $500b Senate floor. obscene much he's consolidated power. Doctors charge patients floor. Nurses assigned 3-4 patients time. Common sense dictates nurses spend time per patient due nature assignment doesn’t mean doctors aren’t either. Since turn pissing contest. aah gotcha - sorry, totally trying make need defend genuinely curious people running around right now. I’m one scientists who’s working moderna study, previously AMA (didn’t name moderna, big info public, it’s fine). I’ve stay isolated family since July need travel epicenters, it’s really lonesome stressful experience. optimism appreciation instantly reminded work field do. 

Y’all, ecstatic (as in, study team). many different people involved it’s undoubtedly one stressful trials I’ve managed I’ll bragging grandkids tell shut up. Science truly beautiful I’m pumped YALL pumped.

Alright internal joyful crying over, back work. Doses go spring it'll take long time vaccinate enough people make difference Meanwhile, Trump telling us hospitals lying COVID-19 deaths money. saying this. won't. totally agree. exactly need tougher restrictions! NZ natural barriers help them, none.

NY locked completely April. slowly opened like responsible state would slowly clamping again. Lol don’t enroll bar semester. I’m merely visitor. You’re reaching straws point. Good news! August? don’t see anyone wasting another July. really end early July 2021 latest. u/tb0x could also give car save people countries every day don't.

-Louis CK timeline probably expect AstraZeneca announce preliminary results Pfizer/BioNTech didn’t “jump gun” Moderna did. cases followed respective protocols announced definitive interim analysis results planned beginning. Pfizer/BioNTech actually waited longer - third scheduled interim analysis - instead announcing first one. Moderna 95 cases theirs, protocol allowed announcement 54. OOF Constantly fix older car expensive. good, working vehicle makes likely able help yourself. everyone lives somewhere decent public transport. Going back normal assumes people gather like used without hotspots re-emerging. likely won’t happen awhile. think coming making claims raised expectations can’t reasonably predict quick turn around. lasts long enough break cycle transmission, pandemic mostly die life go back 100% pre-pandemic normal. Sure, COVID-19 still something people get occasionally, certainly nothing shut world over.

Worst case immunity last forever people would need booster shot interval, point know. undeniably acted way slowly yes going train wreak But... colleges USA require vaccines attend. you’re wrong. 

Pointing visitors completely different subject. still legally upheld rule requires students vaccinate. legal standing mentioned. purpose money store value nothing more, nothing less. 

That nothing point however. know hate thanksgiving anyways bc obnoxious family memebers end arguing something dumb. 

Do family that? opposite. Less spreading equals pressure virus. pressure equals faster mutations. cant fix stupid. dangerous stupid myth wearing mask protect wearer. perpetuate it."
